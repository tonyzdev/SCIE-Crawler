    "abstract": "Abstract Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two‐qubit gates in a ring or all‐to‐all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X‐rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z‐rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a PQC. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum key distribution (QKD) using weak coherent states and homodyne detection is a promising candidate for practical quantum‐cryptographic implementations due to its compatibility with existing telecom equipment and high detection efficiencies. However, despite the actual simplicity of the protocol, the security analysis of this method is rather involved compared to discrete‐variable QKD. This article reviews the theoretical foundations of continuous‐variable quantum key distribution (CV‐QKD) with Gaussian modulation and rederives the essential relations from scratch in a pedagogical way. The aim of this paper is to be as comprehensive and self‐contained as possible in order to be well intelligible even for readers with little pre‐knowledge on the subject. Although the present article is a theoretical discussion of CV‐QKD, its focus lies on practical implementations, taking into account various kinds of hardware imperfections and suggesting practical methods to perform the security analysis subsequent to the key exchange. Apart from a review of well‐known results, this manuscript presents a set of new original noise models which are helpful to get an estimate of how well a given set of hardware will perform in practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum information technology based on solid state qubits has created much interest in converting quantum states from the microwave to the optical domain. Optical photons, unlike microwave photons, can be transmitted by fiber, making them suitable for long distance quantum communication. Moreover, the optical domain offers access to a large set of very well‐developed quantum optical tools, such as highly efficient single‐photon detectors and long‐lived quantum memories. For a high fidelity microwave to optical transducer, efficient conversion at single photon level and low added noise is needed. Currently, the most promising approaches to build such systems are based on second‐order nonlinear phenomena such as optomechanical and electro‐optic interactions. Alternative approaches, although not yet as efficient, include magneto‐optical coupling and schemes based on isolated quantum systems like atoms, ions, or quantum dots. Herein, the necessary theoretical foundations for the most important microwave‐to‐optical conversion experiments are provided, their implementations are described, and the current limitations and future prospects are discussed.",

Turning this long‐sought‐after dream into reality is a great challenge that will require breakthroughs in quantum communication and computing. To establish a global, quantum‐secured communication infrastructure, photonic quantum technologies will doubtlessly play a major role, by providing and interfacing essential quantum resources, for example, flying‐ and stationary qubits or quantum memories. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in the engineering of on‐demand quantum light sources based on semiconductor quantum dots, which enable the generation of close‐to‐ideal single‐ and entangled‐photon states, useful for applications in quantum information processing. This review focuses on implementations of, and building blocks for, quantum communication using quantum‐light sources based on epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots. After reviewing the main notions of quantum communication and introducing the devices used for single‐photon and entangled‐photon generation, an overview of experimental implementations of quantum key distribution protocols using quantum dot based quantum light sources is provided. Furthermore, recent progress toward quantum‐secured communication networks as well as building blocks thereof is summarized.

The architecture of this quantum generator consists of a quantum circuit that encodes a classical random variable into a quantum state and a parameterized quantum circuit trained to mimic the target distribution. The model allows for easy interfacing with a classical function, such as a neural network, and is trained using an adversarial learning approach. It is shown that the quantum generator is able to learn using either a classical neural network or a variational quantum circuit as the discriminator model. This implementation takes advantage of automatic differentiation tools to perform the optimization of the variational circuits employed.

This review highlights how Quantum‐enhanced sensing and imaging exploit nonclassical correlations to attain unprecedented accuracy in chaotic environments. As well as guaranteeing secure communications, quantum cryptography, protected by physical principles, ensures unbreakable cryptographic key exchange. As quantum computing speed increases exponentially, previously unimplementable uses for classical computers become feasible. On‐chip integration enables the mass production of quantum photonic components for pervasive applications by facilitating miniaturization and scalability. A powerful and flexible platform is produced when classical and quantum systems are combined. Quantum spin liquids and other topological materials can maintain their quantum states while subject to decoherence. Despite challenges with decoherence, production, and commercialization, quantum photonics is an exciting new area of study that promises lighting techniques impossible with conventional optics. To realize this promise, researchers from several fields must work together to solve complex technical problems and decode fundamental physics. Finally, advances in quantum‐enabled photonics have the potential to evolve quantum photonic devices and cutting‐edge imaging methods and usher in a new age of lighting options based on quantum dots.",

In this work, the propagation characteristics of 3D DSM‐supported double and triple stripe patterned metamaterial absorbers (MMAs) are investigated in the terahertz (THz) regime by facile modulation of the Fermi level. The results manifest that for the double stripe patterned devices, two strong absorption peaks with near unity are observed at 0.97 THz and 1.63 THz, respectively. When the Fermi level varies in the range of 0.01–0.15 eV, the amplitude (frequency) modulation depth of resonance is up to 77% (27.3%). Additionally, triple stripe MMAs supported by 3D DSM are devised, which can achieve resonant absorption peaks at three specific frequencies of 0.23, 0.345, and 0.46 THz, while the amplitudes of the peaks are as high as 0.997, 0.940, and 0.779, respectively. Furthermore, the resonances can also be regulated, and the amplitude MD reaches ≈20%. These results are very helpful in understanding the tuning mechanisms of metamaterial devices and aiding the design of THz functional devices, such as receivers, detectors, and modulators.",

To tap into this potential, effective schemes for the high‐dimensional generation of entangled states are essential. In this study, two arbitrary 4D entanglement generation protocols based on cross‐Kerr effect are developed, including two‐qudit entangled states with two photon pairs and three‐qudit entangled states with three photon pairs. These 4D entangled states require neither auxiliary photons (or entangled states) nor complicated quantum circuits. The success probabilities of high‐dimensional entangled states are close to 1 and their fidelities are robust against the photon loss with the current technology. The 4D entangled states depend on only simple linear‐optics elements, available four‐dimensional single‐qudit operations, and mature measurement methods, making our proposed protocols feasible and efficient in practical QIT.",

Superconducting‐nanowire single‐photon detectors (SNSPDs) comprise these two solid‐state and optic aspects enabling high‐rate (1.3 Gb s −1 ) quantum key distribution over long distances (&gt;400 km), long‐range quantum communication (&gt;1200 km), as well as space communication (239 000 miles). The attractiveness of SNSPDs stems from competitive performance in the four single‐photon relevant characteristics at wavelengths ranges from UV to the mid‐IR: high detection efficiency, low false‐signal rate, low uncertainty in photon time arrival, and fast reset time. However, to date, these characteristics cannot be optimized simultaneously. In this review, the mechanisms that govern these four characteristics are presented, and it is demonstrated how they are affected by material properties and device design as well as by the operating conditions, allowing aware optimization of SNSPDs. Based on the evolution in the existing literature and state of the art, it is proposed how to choose or design the material and device for optimizing SNSPD performance, while possible future opportunities in the SNSPD technology are also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews theoretical methods developed in the last decade to understand cavity quantum electrodynamics in the ultrastrong-coupling regime, where the strength of the light-matter interaction becomes comparable to the photon frequency. Along with profound modifications of fundamental quantum optical effects giving rise to a rich phenomenology, this regime introduces significant theoretical challenges. One of the most important is the break-down of the rotating-wave approximation which neglects all non-resonant terms in light-matter interaction Hamiltonians. Consequently, a large part of the quantum optical theoretical framework has to be revisited in order to accurately account for all interaction terms in this regime. We give in this article a broad overview of the recent progress, ranging from analytical estimate of ground-state properties to proper derivations of master equations and computation of photodetection signals. For each aspect of the theory, the basic principles of the methods are illustrated on paradigmatic models such as quantum Rabi and spin-boson models. In this spirit, most of the article is devoted to effective models, relevant for the various experimental platforms in which the ultrastrong coupling has been reached, such as semiconductor microcavities and superconducting circuits. The validity of these models is discussed in the last part of the article, where we address recent debates on fundamental issues related to gauge invariance in the ultrastrong-coupling regime.",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges of quantum many-body physics is that the dimensionality of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size, which makes it extremely difficult to solve the Schrödinger equations of the system. But typically, many physical systems have a simplified internal structure which makes the parameters needed to characterize their ground states exponentially smaller. This makes many numerical methods possible in capture the physics of the system. Among these modern numerical techniques, neural networks, which show great power in approximating functions and extracting features of the big data, are now attracting many interests. Neural network representation of quantum many-body states shows great potential in solving some traditionally difficult quantum problems involving large number of freedoms. In this work, we briefly review the progress of using the artificial neural network to build quantum many-body ansatz states. We take Boltzmann machine representation as a prototypical example to illustrate various aspects of neural network representation of quantum many-body states. We first briefly review the classical neural networks, then we illustrate how to use neural networks to represent quantum states and density operators. Some physical properties of the neural network states, including entanglement features, representational power, and the relation with tensor network states, are discussed. For applications, we briefly review the progress of many-body calculating based on neural network states, neural network state approach to tomography, and also the classical simulation of quantum computing based on Boltzmann machine states. At the end of the work, some outlooks and open problems are given.",

However, as a second response, Hall dissipationless transverse currents can appear even in time-reversal symmetric conditions in non-centrosymmetric materials. Moreover, this non-linear effect has a quantum origin: it is related to the geometric properties of the electronic wavefunctions and encoded in the dipole moment of the Berry curvature. Here we review the general theory underpinning this effect and discuss various material platforms where non-linear Hall transverse responses have been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified. On the theoretical front, the link between the non-linear Hall effect and the Berry curvature dipole is discussed using Boltzmann transport theory. On the material front, different platforms, including topological crystalline insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene, and Weyl semimetals are reviewed.",

Connected entanglement graphs spanning each of the full devices are detected, indicating bipartite entanglement over the whole of each device. The application of QREM is shown to increase the observed entanglement within all measurements, in particular, the detected number of entangled pairs of qubits found within ibmq_rochester increases from 31 to 56 of the total 58 connected pairs. The results of this work indicate full bipartite entanglement in two of the largest superconducting devices to date.",

In this article, different types of SPDC sources suitable for multiphoton experiments are reviewed. A comparison of their respective performances is presented, focusing on the parameters of indistinguishability, collection efficiency, and brightness, from which it is possible to see how the spatial and spectral properties of the SPDC process can be tailored, step by step, to achieve near‐perfect photon pairs. Recent progress on multiplexed heralded single‐photon sources, which effectively mitigate the nondeterministic nature of the SPDC process, is also described.",

The performances of basic quantum repeater links for these platforms are evaluated and compared, both for present‐day, state‐of‐the‐art experimental parameters as well as for parameters that can in principle be reached in the future. The ultimate goal is to experimentally explore regimes at intermediate distances—up to a few 100 km—in which the repeater‐assisted secret key transmission rates exceed the maximal rate achievable via direct transmission. Two different protocols are considered, one of which is better adapted to the higher source clock rate and lower memory coherence time of the quantum dot platform, while the other circumvents the need of writing photonic quantum states into the memories in a heralded, nondestructive fashion. The elementary building blocks and protocols can be connected in a modular form to construct a quantum repeater system that is potentially scalable to large distances.",

Nowadays, quantum key distribution (QKD) exited the physics laboratories to become a mature technology, triggering the attention of States, military forces, banks, and private corporations. This work takes on the challenge of bringing QKD closer to a consumer technology: deployed optical fibers by telecommunication companies of different States have been used to realize a quantum network, the first-ever connecting three different countries. This work also emphasizes the necessity of networks where QKD can come up besides classical communications, whose coexistence currently represents the main limitation of this technology. This network connects Trieste to Rijeka and Ljubljana via a trusted node in Postojna. A key rate of over 3 kbps in the shortest link and a 7-hour-long measurement demonstrate the system's stability and reliability. The network has been used to present the QKD at the G20 Digital Ministers' Meeting in Trieste. The experimental results, together with the interest that one of the most important events of international politics has attracted, showcase the maturity of the QKD technology bundle, placing it in the spotlight for consumer applications in the near term.",

For every normalizable linear or nonlinear positive map ϕ on bounded linear operators X , there is an associated normalized PTP channel . Normalized PTP channels include unitary mean field theories, such as the Gross–Pitaevskii equation for interacting bosons, as well as models of linear and nonlinear dissipation. They classify into four types, yielding three distinct forms of nonlinearity whose computational power are explored. In the qubit case, these channels support Bloch ball torsion and other distortions studied previously, where it has been shown that such nonlinearity can be used to increase the separation between a pair of close qubit states, suggesting an exponential speedup for state discrimination. Building on this idea, the authors argue that this operation can be made robust to noise by using dissipation to induce a bifurcation to a novel phase where a pair of attracting fixed points create an intrinsically fault‐tolerant nonlinear state discriminator.",

The success probabilities of two quantum control gates are approximated unit by performing the corresponding classical feed‐forward operations based on the different measuring outcomes of the X‐homodyne detectors to be aimed at the coherent states, and they are robust against the photon loss as well, which are feasible with the current technology and convenient in practical applications.",

This work benchmarks the runtime and accuracy for a representative sample of specialized high-performance simulated and physical quantum processing units. Results show the QMware simulator can reduce the runtime for executing a quantum circuit by up to 78% compared to the next fastest option for algorithms with fewer than 27 qubits. The AWS SV1 simulator offers a runtime advantage for larger circuits, up to the maximum 34 qubits available with SV1. Beyond this limit, QMware can execute circuits as large as 40 qubits. Physical quantum devices, such as Rigetti's Aspen-M2, can provide an exponential runtime advantage for circuits with more than 30 qubits. However, the high financial cost of physical quantum processing units presents a serious barrier to practical use. Moreover, only IonQ's Harmony quantum device achieves high fidelity with more than four qubits.

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum key distribution (QKD) is considered the most immediate application to be widely implemented among a variety of potential quantum technologies. QKD enables sharing secret keys between distant users by using photons as information carriers. An ongoing endeavor is to implement these protocols in practice in a robust, and compact manner so as to be efficiently deployable in a range of real‐world scenarios. Single photon sources (SPS) in solid‐state materials are prime candidates in this respect. This article demonstrates a room temperature, discrete‐variable quantum key distribution system using a bright single photon source in hexagonal‐boron nitride, operating in free‐space. Employing an easily interchangeable photon source system, keys with one million bits length, and a secret key of approximately 70000 bits, at a quantum bit error rate of 6%, with ε‐security of 10 −10 are generated. This study demonstrates the first proof of concept finite‐key BB84 QKD system realized with hBN defects.",

The relationship is investigated between the cube sizes and separation gap of a nanocube dimer and the resulting Purcell enhancement, and shows the possibility of achieving the enhancement of up to 6.4 × 106. Furthermore, to experimentally demonstrate large Purcell enhancements, atomic force microscopy is used to assemble Ag nanocube dimers in the corner-to-corner configuration with the help of prefabricated corner-to-corner dielectric bricks. The decrease of the lifetime of Ru dye molecules from 91.7 ns (on a glass substrate) to the instrument response function limit (1.5 ns) after coupling with nanocube dimers is observed.

The critical innovation lies in manipulating the sector angle of circular columns, granting dynamic control over the rainbow effect and light localization. This manipulation induces distinct group velocities for different light frequencies, leading to their separation and localization at specific corner states. This remarkable “rainbow trapping” phenomenon manifests as highly confined light exhibiting exceptional resilience against disorder.

In the framework of cavity optomechanics, this symmetry breaking is attributed to a nonuniform radiation pressure force resulting from the interaction between light and matter. This study investigates a hybrid cavity optomechanical system (COMS) comprising two optical modes, directly coupled to each other via photon hopping interaction and indirectly via a common mechanical excitation in the form of a movable mirror, and an additional parallel metallic plate that induces a dynamical Casimir force (DCF) interaction between the plates. The two optical cavities are driven by two strong laser fields, accompanied by two weak probe classical fields from each port. The primary focus lies in exploring the nonreciprocal behavior of the light field across ports one and two, strongly manipulated by the DCF. The DCF plays a pivotal role in providing extra degrees of flexibility and manipulation in controlling the nonreciprocal signal transmission by modifying the resonance conditions of the fields within the hybrid COMS and is responsible for the amplification and swapping of information between the two ports.",

Here, is proposed and discussed the quantum generalization of DMs, i.e., three Quantum‐Noise‐Driven Generative Diffusion Models (QNDGDMs) that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non‐trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement, and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, the suggestion is to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a beneficial key ingredient to generate complex probability distributions from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Three examples of the numerical simulations are also included for the proposed approaches. The results are expected to pave the way for new quantum‐inspired or quantum‐based generative diffusion algorithms addressing tasks as data generation with widespread real‐world applications.",

Here a nonlinear cavity‐magnon system is proposed, consisting of a microwave cavity coupled to one or two yttrium–iron–garnet (YIG) spheres supporting magnons with Kerr nonlinearity, to investigate nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade. The nonreciprocity originates from the direction‐dependent Kerr effect, distinctly different from previous proposals with spinning cavities and dissipative couplings. For a single sphere case, nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade can be realized by manipulating the nonreciprocal destructive interference between two active paths, via varying the Kerr coefficient from positive to negative, or vice versa. By optimizing the system parameters, the perfect and well‐tuned nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade can be predicted. For the case of two spheres with opposite Kerr effects, only reciprocal unconventional photon blockade can be observed when two cavity‐magnon coupling strengths Kerr strengths are symmetric. However, when coupling strengths or Kerr strengths become asymmetric, nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade appears. This implies that two‐sphere nonlinear cavity‐magnon systems can be used to switch the transition between reciprocal and nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockades. This study offers a potential platform for investigating the nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in nonlinear cavity magnonics.",

Here, a superconducting quantum battery (SQB) model that exhibits such an advantage is introduced. The model consists of two coupled superconducting qubits that interact during the unitary charging process while remaining in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. First, the model is described, evidence of the quantum advantage is provided, and then the fabrication process of the battery is discussed using superconducting qubits. Analytical expressions for the ergotropy, instantaneous power, and capacity of the SQB, as well as their connection to quantum coherence are derived. It is demonstrated that leveraging the collective effects of Josephson energies and the coupling energy between qubits allows for optimization, resulting in improved energy redistribution and a significant enhancement in charging efficiency. This work highlights the complexities of tuning system parameters, which increase the potential for work extraction from the SQB, providing a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms involved. These findings can be applied to superconducting quantum circuit battery architectures, underscoring the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these systems.

Indeed, the non‐linear coupling possesses a squeezing resource for diverging MP while the non‐monotonous degeneracy lifting by the asymmetries induces an additional tunable transition which further enhances the MP by several orders, as demonstrated by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The resource combination not only leads to cooperative boosts to the divergence of QFI but also brings divergence compensation with the merit of globally high MP. Moreover, the protocol is immune from the problem of diverging preparation time of probe state that may hinder the conventional linear QRM in application of QM. This work establishes a paradigmatic case of combining different sensitivity resources to manipulate QM and maximize MP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the human brain is one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century. As theoretical studies continue to improve the description of the complex mechanisms that regulate biological processes, in parallel numerous experiments are conducted to enrich or verify these theoretical predictions also with the aim of extrapolating more accurate models. In the fields of magnetometry and thermometry, among the various sensors proposed for biological application, nitrogen‐vacancy (NV) centers are emerging as a promising solution due to their perfect biocompatibility and the possibility of being positioned in close proximity to the cell membrane, thus allowing a nanometric spatial resolution down to the nano‐scale. Still many issues must be overcome to obtain either a sensitivity capable of revealing the very weak electromagnetic fields generated by neurons (or other excitable cells) during their firing activity or a spatial resolution sufficient to measure intracellular thermal gradient due to biological processes. However, over the last few years, significant improvements have been achieved in this direction, thanks to the use of innovative techniques. In this review, the new results regarding the application of NV centers will be analyzed and the main challenges that must be afforded for leading to practical applications will be discussed.",

There are abundant members in this 2DLM family beyond graphene, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (MX 2 , M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), semimetal chalcogenide (InSe), black phosphorus, etc. The 2DLMs afford rich and ideal material platforms for studying quantum effects and their corresponding applications in the two‐dimensional (2D) limit.

With applications ranging from quantum computing to cryptographic systems with information-theoretic security, there is strong incentive to introduce quantum communications into many areas of the society.

This tutorial presents recent advances in laser modulation technologies that have enabled the development of efficient and versatile light sources for quantum communications, with a particular focus on quantum key distribution (QKD). Such approaches have been successfully used to demonstrate several QKD protocols with state-of-the-art performance.

Optimally designed photonic structures based on hole gratings produce an ultra-narrow directional beam that matches the small numerical aperture of a single-mode fiber.

The first approach uses one-dimensional nanobeam optomechanical crystals excited by interdigitated transducers, and is characterized by large single-photon optomechanical coupling strength, limited intracavity pump photon population to avoid absorption-induced heating, and low phonon injection efficiency from the transducer to the optomechanical cavity. The second approach uses (quasi) bulk acoustic wave resonators integrated into photonic Fabry-Perot cavity geometries, and is characterized by low single-photon optomechanical coupling strength, high intracavity pump photon population without significant heating, and high phonon injection efficiency.

Its layered architecture plays a key role for new materials such as Van der Waals heterostructures. The layered structure has also unique implications for hosted, optically active defect centers. A very special type of defect center arises from the possibility to host mechanically isolated orbitals localized between the layers. The resulting absence of coupling to low‐frequency acoustic phonons turns out to be the essential element to protect the coherence of optical transitions from mechanical interactions with the environment. Consequently, the spectral transition linewidth remains unusually narrow even at room temperature, thus paving a new way toward coherent quantum optics under ambient conditions.

This work examines the quantum paraelectric state, an elusive state of matter characterized by the smooth saturation of the ferroelectric instability at low temperature due to quantum fluctuations associated with anharmonic phonon effects. The temperature‐dependent evolution of the soft ferroelectric phonon mode in the quantum paraelectric KTaO 3 in the range 0–300 K is modeled by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the stochastic self‐consistent harmonic approximation assisted by an on‐the‐fly machine‐learned force field. The calculated data show that including anharmonic terms is essential to stabilize the spurious imaginary ferroelectric phonon predicted by DFT in the harmonic approximation, in agreement with experiments. Augmenting the DFT workflow with machine‐learned force fields allows for efficient stochastic sampling of the configuration space using large supercells in a wide temperature range, inaccessible to conventional ab initio protocols. This work proposes a robust computational workflow capable of accounting for collective behaviors involving different degrees of freedom and occurring at large time/length scales, paving the way for precise modeling and control of quantum effects in materials.",

Much effort is devoted to lay the foundation of realizing phonon lasers using cavity magnomechanical systems, but up to now no related work is carried out to explore the quantum‐squeezing‐engineered phonon laser action in cavity magnomechanics. Here, the phonon laser action is investigated in a three‐mode cavity magnomechanical system built based on a microwave resonator‐yttrium iron garnet sphere composite device, focusing on the effect induced by the magnon‐mode squeezing. It is found that the magnon squeezing can improve the effective magnon–photon and magnon–phonon coupling rates. It is demonstrated that the phonon laser action can be engineered and enhanced by changing the squeezing strength. This scheme provides a new mechanism to improve the effective magnon–photon and magnon–phonon couplings for various applications, and demonstrates the feasibility of realizing high‐gain and low‐threshold phonon lasers with cavity magnomechanical platforms.",

INTERP guesses the initial parameters at level by applying interpolation to the optimized parameters at level , achieving better performance than random initialization (RI). Nevertheless, INTERP consumes extensive costs for deep QAOA because it necessitates optimization at each level depth. To address it, a Multilevel Leapfrogging Interpolation (MLI) strategy is proposed. MLI produces initial parameters from level to () at level , omitting the optimization rounds from level to . MLI executes optimization at few levels rather than each level, and this operation is called Multilevel Leapfrogging optimization (M‐Leap). The performance of MLI is investigated on the Maxcut problem. The simulation results demonstrate MLI achieves the same quasi‐optima as INTERP while consuming 1/2 of costs required by INTERP. Besides, for MLI, where there is no RI except for level 1, the greedy‐MLI strategy is presented. The simulation results suggest greedy‐MLI has better stability than INTERP and MLI beyond obtaining the quasi‐optima. According to the efficiency of finding the quasi‐optima, the idea of M‐Leap might be extended to other training tasks, especially those requiring numerous optimizations.",

The quantum light source is a fluorescent color center in hexagonal boron nitride. The emitter is off‐resonantly excited by a diode laser and directly coupled to an integrated photonic processor that routes the photons to different experiments performed directly on‐chip: i) the characterization of the single photon source and ii) testing a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics, namely the relation of the probability density and the wave function (known as Born's rule). The described payload is currently being integrated into a 3U CubeSat and scheduled to launch in 2024 into low Earth orbit. Therefore the feasibility of true single photon sources and reconfigurable photonic circuits in space can be evaluated. This provides a promising route toward a high‐speed quantum network.",

All these operations require coherent control of the color center's spin state.

This approach can be used even when the modes are not orthogonal, demonstrating the principle with highly efficient phase‐only approximations to the modal basis. By numerical simulation and experimental analysis, the advantages of this approach are illustrated, which include faster convergence to the object, with higher signals and fidelity, which are demonstrated with an order of magnitude less masks than conventional approaches for the same fidelity in outcome.

    "abstract": "Abstract A system is proposed for the efficient coupling of plasmon‐enhanced polarized single photons into a 1D apodized hybrid photonic‐plasmonic (HPP) cavity structure, to realize cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The HPP cavity is formed by placing a gold nanorod (GNR) on an apodized 1D photonic crystal (PhC) cavity designed on a diamond waveguide. It is shown that the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (QE) can be strongly enhanced by utilizing the combination of GNR and Phc cavity structure, leading to the emission of highly polarized and bright single photons. The Purcell factor is numerically estimated as high ≈5303, with a cavity‐enhanced coupling efficiency of up to ≈24.3% and a degree of polarization (DOP) of more than 99%, in the guided modes of the HPP cavity. Under the resonance condition, a 28‐fold increase in enhancement factor in the HPP cavity as compared to a moderate finesse‐based Phc cavity is achieved. The cavity is designed to minimize the losses, resulting in a scattering‐limited Q ‐factor and one‐pass loss estimated to be around 21500 and 0.1%, respectively.

Many protocols employing discrete or continuous variables have been developed over time.

Present efforts aim to create systems that can exploit both these strengths, foreseeing the future challenge regarding the realization of a quantum network consisting of multiple and heterogeneous interconnected nodes. Within such a context, a possible solution is systems able to efficiently toggle between discrete and continuous variable working modes with hybrid quantum state encoders. Therefore, this study presents a new hybrid encoder based on an iPOGNAC modulator, ensuring compatibility with Discrete‐Variable (DV) and Continuous‐Variable (CV) QKD systems that can be assembled entirely with commercial‐off‐the‐shelf components. The proposed scheme is the first supporting DV polarization protocols, thus making it an appealing candidate for space nodes of a future quantum network, given that polarization‐based protocols are well suited for space links.",

In the paper, deterministic schemes are proposed for interconversion between three‐logic‐qubit W state and three‐logic‐qubit Knill‐Laflamme‐Milburn state within a decoherence‐free subspace (DFS). The process of mutual transformation leverages the state‐selective nature of a quantum dot (QD) confined in a double‐sided microcavity, along with high‐fidelity, error‐predictable quantum control gates. Furthermore, the incorporation of single‐photon detectors helps to identify and mitigate potential failures arising from imperfect interactions between photons and the QD‐cavity system, thereby significantly enhancing experimental viability. In‐depth analyses of both protocols confirm that they can, in principle, achieve near‐unit fidelities and outstanding efficiencies.

ZnO has been widely used as an electron‐transport layer (ETL) because of its superior performance compared to other metal oxides. However, nearly barrier‐free electron injection into the QD EML leads to spontaneous charge transfer and excess electron injection, resulting in reduced device performance. Here, to adjust electron–hole balance and thereby improve the lifetime and efficiency of QLEDs, we introduce an yttrium (Y)‐doped ZnO (YZO) ETL into QLEDs. The sol–gel processed YZO film, with a mobility that could be simply tuned by varying the Y concentration, provides enhanced charge‐transport balance by suppressing excess electron flow to the QD EML. Furthermore, YZO helps suppress QD charging and smooth the surface morphology. Applying the YZO ETL into the inverted‐structure QLED enables us to achieve color‐saturated red emission, an improved external quantum efficiency of up to 8.6%, and an eight times longer lifetime compared to the device with undoped ZnO. This result provides a simple method for enhancing the performance of QLEDs by easily controlling metal doping concentration in the sol–gel processed ZnO ETL.",

This requires long‐lived quantum memories, efficient light–matter interface, and deterministic quantum gate operations. Among matter qubits, the electron spin of nitrogen vacancy center in diamond is an appealing option for its long coherence time at room temperature, deterministic microwave control, and optical preparation and readout of the qubit. However, its poor optical properties, including weak zero‐phonon‐line emission and large spectral diffusion, limit its potential for large‐scale deployment in quantum nodes. This has motivated the investigation for alternative quantum emitters that combine long‐time memory and coherent optical properties together. The emerging group‐IV split‐vacancy color centers in diamond, such as silicon‐vacancy, germanium‐vacancy, tin‐vacancy, and lead‐vacancy centers, are promising candidates of this ongoing exploration. These quantum emitters simultaneously possess microsecond spin coherence time and optically bright transitions with narrow linewidths. This review reports recent efforts on extending the spin coherence time of these color centers via temperature, strain, and charge control, which paves the road towards constructing solid‐based matter–photon interface for quantum network applications.",

In its simplest form, one only needs to put a strongly absorbing material at the appropriate place between two mirrors, and quantum magic can appear. Only recently has it been discovered that strong coupling can affect a host of significant effects at a material and molecular level, which were thought to be independent of the `light' environment: phase transitions, conductivity, chemical reactions, etc. This review addresses the fundamentals of this opportunity: the quantum mechanical foundations, the relevant plasmonic and photonic structures, and a description of the various applications, connecting materials chemistry with quantum information, nonlinear optics and chemical reactivity. Ultimately, revealing the interplay between light and matter in this new regime opens attractive avenues for many applications in the material, chemical, quantum mechanical and biological realms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum simulations are one of the pillars of quantum technologies. These simulations provide insight in fields as varied as high energy physics, many‐body physics, or cosmology to name only a few. Several platforms, ranging from ultracold‐atoms to superconducting circuits through trapped ions have been proposed as quantum simulators. This article reviews recent developments in another well established platform for quantum simulations: polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. These quasiparticles obey a nonlinear Schrödigner equation (NLSE), and their propagation in the medium can be understood in terms of quantum hydrodynamics. As such, they are considered as “fluids of light.” The challenge of quantum simulations is the engineering of configurations in which the potential energy and the nonlinear interactions in the NLSE can be controlled. Here, some landmark experiments with polaritons in microcavities are revisited, how the various properties of these systems may be used in quantum simulations is discussed, and the richness of polariton systems to explore nonequilibrium physics is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A method to integrate nanowire‐based quantum dot single photon sources on‐chip using evanescent coupling is demonstrated. By deterministically placing an appropriately tapered III‐V nanowire, containing a single quantum dot, on top of a silicon‐based ridge waveguide, the quantum dot emission directed toward the taper can be transferred to the ridge waveguide with calculated efficiencies close to 100%. As the evanescent coupling is bidirectional, the source can be optically pumped in both free‐space and through the ridge waveguide. The latter configuration paves the way toward a self‐contained, all‐fiber, plug‐and‐play solution for applications requiring a bright on‐demand single photon source. Using InAsP quantum dots embedded in InP nanowire waveguides, coupling efficiencies to a SiN ridge waveguide of 74% with a single photon purity of 97% are demonstrated. The technique to demonstrate deterministic placement of single quantum emitters onto pre‐fabricated waveguides is used, an important step toward the fabrication of complex quantum photonic circuits.",

Here, a feasible and fast scheme for universal quantum computation on superconducting circuits with nonadiabatic non‐Abelian geometric phases is proposed, using resonant interaction of three‐level quantum system. In this scheme, arbitrary single‐qubit quantum gates can be implemented in a single‐loop scenario by shaping both the amplitudes and phases of the two driving microwave fields resonantly coupled to a transmon device. Moreover, nontrivial two‐qubit gates can also be realized with an auxiliary transmon simultaneously coupled to the two target transmons in an effective resonant way. In particular, this proposal can be compatible to various optimal control techniques, which further enhances the robustness of the quantum operations. Therefore, this proposal represents a promising way toward fault‐tolerant quantum computation on solid‐state quantum circuits.",

Truncating an SU(1,1) interferometer, by omitting the second two-mode squeezer, leaves a prototype that uses the entanglement of two-mode squeezing to detect and characterize a disturbance on one of the two modes from measurement statistics gathered from both modes.",

The existence of two Fermi surfaces with Berry's phase along with the signature of strong spin–orbit coupling suggest the formation of Rashba spin‐split bands. As in topological insulators, two‐fold planar Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance are also observed in EuO–KTO.

There is no efficient method to verify single multipartite entanglement that is not generated by multisource quantum networks with local operations and shared randomness. The goal in this work is to solve this problem. First, a new local model is proposed for describing all the states that can be generated by using distributed entangled states and shared randomness without classical communication. This model is stronger than the biseparable model and implies new genuinely multipartite entanglement. With the present local model it is proved that all the permutationally symmetric entangled pure states are new genuinely multipartite entanglement. It is further proved that the new feature holds for all the multipartite entangled pure states in the biseparable model with the dimensions of local systems being not larger than three. The new multipartite entanglement is also robust against general noises. Finally, a simple Bell inequality is provided to verify new genuinely multipartite entangled pure qubit states in the present model. The results show new insight into featuring the genuinely multipartite entanglement in the distributive scenarios.",

Despite the recent progress of integrating hBN emitters in photonic waveguides, a deterministic, site‐controlled process remains elusive. Here, the integration of selected hBN emitter in silicon nitride waveguide is demonstrated. A small misalignment angle of 4° is shown between the emission‐dipole orientation and the waveguide propagation direction. The integrated emitter maintains high single‐photon purity despite subsequent encapsulation and nanofabrication steps, delivering quantum light with zero delay second order correlation function . The results provide an important step toward deterministic, large scale, quantum photonic circuits at room temperature using atom‐like single‐photon emitters.",

Despite the potential representative power, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited since their training process proves to be hard. The advent of commercial adiabatic quantum computers (AQCs) raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices can increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. Here, the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs is demonstrated, thanks to an embedding that associates the nodes of the neural networks to virtual qubits. A semantic quantum search is implemented thanks to a reverse annealing schedule. Such an approach exploits more information from the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling algorithm. The semantic training is shown to quickly raise the sampling probability of a subset of the set of the configurations. Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM semantically trained achieves good scores on reconstruction tasks. The development of such techniques paves the way toward the establishment of a quantum advantage of adiabatic quantum computers, especially given the foreseen improvement of such hardware.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been successfully applied to quantum approximate optimization algorithms, variational quantum compiling and quantum machine learning models. The performances of VQAs largely depend on the architecture of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Quantum architecture search (QAS) aims to automate the design of PQCs in different VQAs with classical optimization algorithms. However, current QAS algorithms do not use prior experiences and search the quantum architecture from scratch for each new task, which is inefficient and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a meta quantum architecture search (MetaQAS) algorithm, which learns good initialization heuristics of the architecture (i.e., meta-architecture), along with the meta-parameters of quantum gates from a number of training tasks such that they can adapt to new tasks with a small number of gradient updates, which leads to fast learning on new tasks. The proposed MetaQAS can be used with arbitrary gradient-based QAS algorithms. Simulation results of variational quantum compiling on three- and four-qubit circuits show that the architectures optimized by MetaQAS converge much faster than a state-of-the-art gradient-based QAS algorithm, namely DQAS. MetaQAS also achieves a better solution than DQAS after fine-tuning of gate parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diamond has numerous outstanding properties in mechanics, physics, chemistry, electronics, thermodynamics, and spintronics for either classic micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) devices or hybrid quantum MEMS/NEMS systems. The extremely high mechanical strength and the ultra‐wide bandgap energy enable the development of mechanically and thermally robust MEMS/NEMS sensors and switches, while the long coherence time of spin defects center enables the reading out through optical methods, precise quantum sensing, and quantum information processing. In this paper, the development of diamond‐based MEMS/NEMS from the viewpoints of classic devices to quantum systems are reviewed. The fabrication process and the classic applications of diamond MEMS/NEMS devices are first described, including those from micro‐crystalline, nano‐crystalline/ultranano‐crystalline, and single‐crystalline diamonds. Then, the physical properties of nitrogen‐vacancy defect center, as well as the application referred to the hybrid system composed of MEMS structures and nitrogen‐vacancy centers embedded, strain–spin interaction, and diamond‐based optomechanics are introduced. Finally, a conclusion and outlook are presented. It is expected that diamond MEMS/NEMS is not only an ideal platform for high‐performance and high‐reliability advanced classic MEMS devices but also for quantum sensing, information, and exploring the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.",

This field holds promise for advancing quantum‐enhanced sensors, including atomic clocks and magnetometers. However, practical constraints exist in the four fundamental steps of quantum metrology, including initialization, sensing, readout, and estimation. Valuable resources, such as coherence time, impose limitations on the performance of quantum sensors. Machine learning, enabling learning and prediction without explicit knowledge, provides a powerful tool in optimizing quantum metrology with limited resources.

    "abstract": "Abstract Learning problems involve settings in which an algorithm has to make decisions based on data, and possibly side information such as expert knowledge. This study has two main goals. First, it reviews and generalizes different results on the data and model complexity of quantum learning, where the data and/or the algorithm can be quantum, focusing on information‐theoretic techniques. Second, it introduces the notion of copy complexity, which quantifies the number of copies of a quantum state required to achieve a target accuracy level. Copy complexity arises from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about quantum data. As a result, empirical risk minimization is generally inapplicable. The paper presents novel results on the copy complexity for both training and testing. To make the paper self‐contained and approachable by different research communities, an extensive background material is provided on classical results from statistical learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states. Throughout, the differences between quantum and classical learning are highlighted by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and extensive pointers are provided to the literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Jaynes–Cummings Model (JCM) is a fundamental model and building block for light‐matter interactions, quantum information and quantum computation. The present work analytically analyzes the topological feature manifested by the JCM in the presence of non‐Hermiticity which may arise from dissipation and decay rates. Indeed, the eigenstates of the JCM are topologically characterized by spin windings in 2D plane. The non‐Hermiticity tilts the spin‐winding plane and induces an out‐of‐plane component, while the topological feature is maintained. In particular, besides the invariant spin texture nodes, the study reveals a non‐Hermiticity‐induced reversal transition of the tilting angle and spin winding direction with a fractional phase gain at gap closing, a partially level‐independent reversal transition without gap closing, and a completely level‐independent super‐invariant point with untilted angle and also without gap closing. The result demonstrates that the topological feature is robust against non‐Hermiticity, which may be favorable in practical applications. On the other hand, one may conversely make use of the disadvantageous dissipation and decay rates to reverse the spin winding direction, which may add a controlled way for topological manipulation of quantum systems in light‐matter interactions.",

Central to this study is the using of an innovative intrusion detection system leveraging QML models, with a preference for Quantum Neural Network (QNN) architectures for classification tasks. The inherent advantages of QNNs, notably their parallel processing capabilities facilitated by quantum computers and the exploitation of quantum superposition and parallelism, are elucidated. These attributes empower QNNs to execute certain classification tasks expediently and with heightened efficiency. Empirical validation is conducted through the deployment and testing of a QNN‐based intrusion detection system, employing a subset of the CIC‐DDoS 2019 dataset. Notably, despite employing a reduced feature set, the QNN‐based system exhibits remarkable classification accuracy, achieving a commendable rate of 92.63%. Moreover, the study advocates for the utilization of quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit, facilitating QNN training on local machines or quantum simulators. The findings underscore the efficacy of a QNN‐based intrusion detection system in attaining superior classification accuracy when confronted with large‐scale training datasets. However, it is imperative to acknowledge the constraints imposed by the limited number of qubits available on local machines and simulators.",

A self‐standing heteroepitaxial CVD diamond film with a (111) orientation and a thickness of 150 µm is grown on a non‐diamond substrate and subsequently separated from it. The high uniformity and crystallinity of the (111)‐oriented diamond is confirmed. A 150‐µm thick NV‐diamond layer is then deposited on the heteroepitaxial diamond. The T 2 value measured by confocal microscopy is 20 µs, which corresponds to substitutional nitrogen defect concentration of 8 ppm. The nitrogen‐vacancy concentration and T 2 * are estimated to be 0.05 ppm and 0.05 µs by continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW‐ODMR) spectroscopy in a fiber‐top sensor configuration. In a gradiometer, where two sensors are placed on both sides of the busbar, the noise floor is 17 nT/Hz 0.5 in the frequency range of 10–40 Hz without magnetic shielding. The Allan deviation of the magnetic field noise in the laboratory is below 0.3 µT, which corresponds to a busbar current of 10 mA, in the accumulation time range of 10 ms to 100 s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum steering, an intermediate quantum correlation lying between entanglement and nonlocality, has emerged as a critical quantum resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks such as quantum key distribution and true randomness generation. The ability to detect and quantify quantum steering is crucial for these applications. Semi‐definite programming (SDP) has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify quantum steering. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the optimal measurement strategy is not priori known, making it time‐consuming to compute the steerable measure for any given quantum state. Furthermore, the utilization of SDP requires full information of the quantum state, necessitating quantum state tomography, which can be complex and resource‐consuming. In this work, the semi‐supervised self‐training model is used to estimate the steerable weight, a pivotal measure of quantum steering. The model can be trained using a limited amount of labeled data, thus reducing the time for labeling. The features are constructed by the probabilities derived by performing three sets of projective measurements under arbitrary local unitary transformations on the target states, circumventing the need for quantum tomography. The model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and can achieve high levels of precision with limited resources.",

This protocol accommodates an unequal number of agents in two groups with and enables the addition and revocation of agents in the Group 2 in both the pre‐measurement phase and the post‐measurement phase. In addition, agents in the Group 1 can verify the shares of agents in the Group 2 without the need for a third party, which significantly enhances the security and simplifies the protocol. A comprehensive security analysis demonstrates that the protocol can effectively resist common attacks in quantum communications. The simulation on the IBM's Qiskit framework shows the correctness and usefulness of the protocol. Compared with previous protocols, the protocol is more flexible and practical. Moreover, the protocol based on Bell states exhibits superior performance compared with previous protocols that utilised others entangled states.

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum computing has the potential to provide solutions to problems that are intractable on classical computers, but the accuracy of the current generation of quantum computers suffer from the impact of noise or errors such as leakage, crosstalk, dephasing, and amplitude damping among others. As the access to quantum computers is almost exclusively in a shared environment through cloud‐based services, it is possible that an adversary can exploit crosstalk noise to disrupt quantum computations on nearby qubits, even carefully designing quantum circuits to purposely lead to wrong answers. In this study, the extent and characteristics of crosstalk noise are studied through tomography conducted on IBM Quantum computers, leading to an enhanced crosstalk simulation model. These results indicate that crosstalk noise is a significant source of errors on IBM quantum hardware, making crosstalk based attack a viable threat to quantum computing in a shared environment. Based on the crosstalk simulator benchmarked against IBM hardware, the impact of crosstalk attacks and develop strategies are assessed for mitigating crosstalk effects. Through a systematic set of simulations, the effectiveness of three crosstalk attack mitigation strategies is assessed, namely circuit separation, qubit allocation optimization via reinforcement learning, and the use of spectator qubits, and show that they all overcome crosstalk attack risk with varying degrees of success and help to secure quantum computing in a shared platform.",

Here, quantum coherence in electron quintet states up to 505 ns at room temperature is observed, enabling quantum operations up to 54 times. Detailed investigations show that two Rabi oscillations from the multiple levels of the quintet are detectable at room temperature, with frequencies of 1.69 ± 0.01 and 1.39 ± 0.01 times of that of triplet states, respectively.

In the introduced model, the spectral collapse occurring in the standard two‐photon QRM is stabilized by the presence of the quartic potential. The collapse is then transformed into a quantum phase transition, which occurs in the low‐frequency limit of the light mode, whose remnant at finite ratio between qubit and mode frequencies can be applied to critically enhanced quantum metrology. It is found that the four‐photon term entails a much higher measurement precision compared to the standard two‐photon QRM. The mechanism behind the higher precision can be traced to the different behavior of the ground state wave function as the system is tuned through the transition. As the standard two‐photon QRM, despite the absence of the spectral collapse, the proposed model allows for a finite preparation time for the probe state (PTPS).",

The experimental fidelities are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, thus proving the feasibility to realize quantum autoencoders via quantum adders in state-of-the-art superconducting quantum technologies.",

Materials containing the structural motif of a square net are known to frequently be topological semimetals. In this work, the synthesis and structural characterization of the square‐net‐based magnetic topological semimetal candidates GdSb x Te 2− x − δ (0, δ indicating the vacancy level) are reported. The structural evolution of the series with Sb substitution is studied, finding a transition between a simple tetragonal square‐net structure to complex superstructure formations due to the presence of charge density waves. The structural modulations coincide with a significant modification of the magnetic order. This work thus establishes GdSb x Te 2− x − δ as a platform to study the interplay between crystal symmetry, band filling, charge density wave, and magnetism in a topological semimetal candidate.",

Here an effective and reliable method of increasing the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic Fe 3 GeTe 2 vdW materials by Ga implantation is reported. It is found that implanting Ga into Fe 3 GeTe 2 by the amount of 10 −3 Ga Å −3 could greatly enhance the Fe 3 GeTe 2 Curie temperature by almost 100%. Spatially resolved microdiffraction and element‐resolved X‐ray absorption spectroscopy show little changes in the Fe 3 GeTe 2 crystal structure and Fe valence state. In addition, the Ga implantation changes the Fe 3 GeTe 2 magnetization from out‐of‐plane direction at low temperature to in‐plane direction at high temperature. The result opens a new opportunity for tailoring the magnetic properties of vdW materials beyond room temperature.",

A semiquantum reinforcement learning approach is employed to adapt one qubit state, an “agent,” to an unknown quantum state, an “environment,” by successive single‐shot measurements and feedback, in order to achieve maximum overlap. The experimental learning device herein, composed of a quantum photonics setup, can adjust the corresponding parameters to rotate the agent system based on the measurement outcomes “0” or “1” in the environment (i.e., reward/punishment signals). The results show that, when assisted by such a quantum machine learning technique, fidelities of the deterministic single‐photon agent states can achieve over 88% under a proper reward/punishment ratio within 50 iterations. This protocol offers a tool for reconstructing an unknown quantum state when only limited copies are provided, and can also be extended to higher dimensions, multipartite, and mixed quantum state scenarios.",

Here, the basics of quantum entanglement are discussed focusing on the case it is related to the degrees of freedom of a single particle. It is discussed how the violation of peculiar inequalities in this context rules out any realistic non‐contextual hidden variable theory alternative to quantum mechanics. Moreover, experiments that demonstrate single‐particle entanglement for photons, neutrons, and atoms are discussed. Finally, the applications of single‐particle entanglement as a resource for quantum information are discussed and specifically quantum key distribution is detailed, where the use of single‐particle entangled photons allows to improve the security of the BB84 protocol.",

In the proposed network, the squeezed/anti‐squeezed vacuum states of the constituent optical parametric oscillators establish quantum correlations below the threshold through optical mutual coupling and collective symmetry breaking is induced above the threshold as a decision‐making process. This initial search process is followed by a chaotic solution search step facilitated by optical error correction feedback. The particular algorithm used by the proposed network is derived from the truncated Wigner stochastic differential equation. As an optical hardware technology, the proposed CIM has several unique features, including programmable all‐to‐all Ising coupling in the optical domain, directional coupling ()‐induced chaotic behavior, and the ability to operate at low power at room temperature. The proposed CIM is evaluated in terms of its performance and how this scales at different problem sizes. It is shown that the various CIMs discussed in this paper are effective at solving many problem types, although the optimal algorithm depends on the problem case. It is further shown that the proposed optical implementations can be achieved with low energy consumption on thin‐film LiNbO 3 platforms.",

However, quantum systems are not unique in being hard to simulate. For example, classical nonlinear continuum systems and fields are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations whose solution is also hard for classical computers. Solving such equations is essential for many economically important industries/applications such as the aerospace industry, weather‐forecasting, fiber‐optics communication, and plasma magneto‐hydrodynamics. This raises the question: can a quantum computer speed‐up solving these equations? In this Review, a new quantum algorithm is described for solving nonlinear partial differential equations for which the answer is yes. First, a new quantum algorithm is discussed for solving the Navier‐Stokes nonlinear partial differential equations which govern the flow of a viscous fluid. Its construction, verification, and computational cost are described, and it is shown that a significant quantum speed‐up is possible. Its generalization to a quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear partial differential equations is described. The Review closes with a discussion of next steps forward. These new quantum algorithms open up a large new application area for quantum computing with substantial economic impact, including the trillion‐dollar aerospace industry.",

State‐of‐the‐art methods to reach chemical accuracy in hybrid quantum‐classical electronic structure calculations of alkali hydride molecules on NISQ devices from IBM are outlined here.

Next, it is outlined how to use quantum imaginary time evolution and Lanczos as a complementary method to variational techniques, highlighting the advantages of each approach. Finally, a new error mitigation method is demonstrated which uses systematic error cancellation via hidden inverse gate constructions, improving the performance of typical variational algorithms. These results show that electronic structure calculations have advanced rapidly, to routine chemical accuracy for simple molecules, from their inception on quantum computers a few short years ago, and they point to further rapid progress to larger molecules as the power of NISQ devices grows.",

They have become one of the most stimulating solid‐state material platforms to explore beautiful collective quantum phenomena originating from macroscopic coherence in condensation and superfluidity, Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, and various topological excitations in the form of solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. They can also provide opportunities for the development of pioneering photonic devices by exploiting bistability and parametric scatterings due to strong nonlinearity that possess remarkable performance advantages of power‐efficient operation, ultrafast response time, and scalable planar geometries. This story becomes profound and fascinating when the spins of excitons are taken into account, that can be directly accessed through light polarization states. The purpose of this review is to give central principles of microcavity exciton‐polariton spins and their anisotropic interactions, which can couple with the effective magnetic fields from mode‐splitting of microcavity photons and spin‐dependent relaxation processes of quantum‐well excitons.

The unconventional spin-orbit torque vanishes when a Cu spacer is introduced between Py and $\\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$, indicating that the unconventional spin-orbit torque in this system originates at the interface. These findings are important for realizing efficient antiferromagnet-based spintronic devices via interfacial engineering.",

It has potential applications in developing next‐generation frequency standards, magnetometers, radar, and navigation. However, the ubiquitous decoherence in the quantum world degrades the quantum resources and forces the precision back to or even worse than the classical limit, which is called the no‐go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and greatly hinders its applications. Therefore, how to realize the promised performance of quantum metrology in realistic noisy situations attracts much attention in recent years. The principle, categories, and applications of quantum metrology are reviewed. Special attention is paid to different quantum resources that can bring quantum superiority in enhancing sensitivity. Then, the no‐go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and its active control under different kinds of noise‐induced decoherence situations are introduced.",

In this work, the use of a previously‐introduced qubit encoding scheme is explored to reduce the number of qubits, to evaluate the effectiveness of Noisy Intermediate‐Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices when applied to industry relevant optimization problems. A quantum variational approach is applied to a testbed of multiple VRPTW instances ranging from 11 to 3964 routes. These intances are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems based on realistic shipping scenarios. The results are compared with standard binary‐to‐qubit mappings after executing on simulators as well as various quantum hardware platforms, including IBMQ, AWS (Rigetti), and IonQ. These results are benchmarked against the classical solver, Gurobi. The approach can find approximate solutions to the VRPTW comparable to those obtained from quantum algorithms using the full encoding, despite the reduction in qubits required. These results suggest that using the encoding scheme to fit larger problem sizes into fewer qubits is a promising step in using NISQ devices to find approximate solutions for industry‐based optimization problems, although additional resources are still required to eke out the performance from larger problem sizes.",

Further, the variations of average key rate (per pulse) with zenith angle and link length in different weather conditions in day and night considering extremely low noise for dimension are investigated using elliptic beam approximation. The effectiveness of the HD‐(extended) protocols used here in creating satellite‐based quantum key distribution links (both up‐link and down‐link) are established by appropriately modeling the atmosphere and analyzing the variation of average key rates with the probability distribution of the transmittance (PDT).

To address these challenges, a novel semi‐quantum secure multiparty summation (SQSMS) protocol is proposed based on high‐dimensional entangled states and single‐particle states. The protocol leverages the entanglement correlation to guarantee the security of the transmission, enabling resistance against various potential attacks. Then, by utilizing the IBM Qiskit platform, corresponding quantum circuits and simulation results are presented to validate the feasibility and correctness of the protocol. Furthermore, building upon the foundation of the SQSMS protocol, semi‐quantum anonymous auction and anonymous ranking protocols are further constructed. Compared with previous approaches, the designed protocols cater to the requirements of their respective counterparts. Consequently, the approach may have broad applications in semi‐quantum secure multiparty computation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Shaped laser pulses have been remarkably effective in investigating various aspects of light–matter interactions spanning a broad range of research. Chirped laser pulses exhibiting a time‐varying frequency, or quadratic spectral phase, form a crucial category in the group of shaped laser pulses. This type of pulses have made a ubiquitous presence from spectroscopic applications to developments in high‐power laser technology, and from nanophotonics to quantum optical communication, ever since their introduction. In the case of quantum technologies recently, substantial efforts are being invested toward achieving a truly scalable architecture. Concurrently, it is important to develop methods to produce robust photon sources. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots hold great potential, due to their exceptional photophysical properties and on‐demand operating nature. Concerning the scalability aspect of semiconductor quantum dots, it is advantageous to develop a simple, yet robust method to generate photon states from it. Chirped pulse excitation has been widely demonstrated as a robust and efficient state preparation scheme in quantum dots, thereby boosting its applicability as a stable photon source in a real‐world scenario. Despite the rapid growth and advancements in laser technologies, the generation and control of chirped laser pulses can be demanding. Here, an overview of a selected few approaches is presented to tailor and characterize chirped pulses for the efficient excitation of a quantum dot source. By taking the chirped‐pulse‐induced adiabatic rapid passage process in quantum dot as an example, numerical design examples are presented along with experimental advantages and challenges in each method and conclude with an outlook on future perspectives.",

This study investigates the dynamics of the recent swing‐up scheme as an excitation method for a two‐level system and its performance in single‐photon generation. By applying two far red‐detuned laser pulses, the two‐level system can be prepared in the excited state with near‐unity fidelity. The successful operation and coherent character of this technique are demonstrated using a semiconductor quantum dot (QD). Moreover, the multi‐dimensional parameter space of the two laser pulses is explored to analyze its impact on excitation fidelity. Finally, the performance of the scheme as an excitation method for generating high‐quality single photons is analyzed. The swing‐up scheme itself proves effective, exhibiting nearly perfect single‐photon purity, while the observed indistinguishability in the studied sample is limited by the influence of the inevitable high excitation powers on the semiconductor environment of the quantum dot.",

Further, the spin polarization curves are obtained by introducing the spin polarization equations. Given the diminishing marginal utility resulting from the enhancement of performance through increased spin polarization, long‐term sensitivity is employed to determine optimal spin polarization range. The optimal long‐term sensitivity for four displayed states is (@31.5Hz), while the ultimate minimum sensitivity is 10.7 (@31.5Hz). The optimal spin polarization ranges at three temperatures are 78.9%–87.1%, 82.3%–88.5%, and 84.5%–88.4%, respectively.

By employing the parallel tempering method, the location of the spin‐glass phase transition is extrapolated from the pseudo‐critical temperature of finite‐sized systems. The results confirm a spin‐glass phase at finite temperature in random‐regular and small‐world graphs, in agreement with previous studies. However, strong evidence is obtained that this phase only occurs at zero temperature in the quasi‐2D graphs of D‐Wave, as their pseudo‐critical temperature drifts toward zero. This implies that the asymptotic runtime to find the low‐energy configuration of those graphs is likely to be polynomial in the size of the problem. Nevertheless, this scaling may only be reached for system sizes much larger than existing annealers, as the drift in the pseudo‐critical temperature is slow. This slowness, together with an abrupt increase in thermalization times around the pseudo‐critical temperature, may render the search for low‐energy configurations with classical methods impractical.",

However, it is challenging to distinguish between each polarization moment and evaluate its effect on the magnetic resonance response signal in an alkali vapor cell with buffer gas. To address this issue, a method is proposed to identify different polarization moments through the frequency shift of the magnetic resonance response signal. The proportion of each polarization moment is determined, and it is demonstrated that the magnetic resonance response signal is affected by the hexadecapole moment, resulting in a frequency shift and a decrease in signal amplitude. To mitigate this effect, an approach is investigated to manipulate the polarization moments by flipping the phase of the pump light. Ultimately, a 15.19% increase in response amplitude is achieved in the simulated geomagnetic environment within the magnetic shield barrel. The theory and method presented here provide strong support for the study of the polarization moments in an alkali vapor cell with buffer gas, which potentially enhance the performance of NMOR atomic magnetometers.",

In particular, the transitions are found to be both symmetry‐breaking Landau‐class transitions (LCTs) and symmetry‐protected topological‐class transitions (TCTs), thus realizing a simultaneous occurrence of critical LCTs and TCTs that are conventionally incompatible due to contrary symmetry requirements. Besides establishing a paradigmatic case to break the incompatibility of the LCTs and the TCTs in non‐Hermitian systems, the both availabilities of the sensitive critical feature and the robust topological feature can also provide more potential for designing quantum devices or sensors.",

Compared with the previous schemes based on the ideal giant circular birefringence, the present schemes use the balance condition of the single‐sided QD‐cavity system, which can be achieved in both the weak‐ and strong‐coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Under the balance condition, the noise caused by the unbalanced reflectance between the coupled and uncoupled QD‐cavity systems can be efficiently depressed, so that the fidelity of each quantum gate operation can be increased to unity in principle. The schemes exhibit the possibility of realizing high‐fidelity and scalable quantum computing with single QD spins and single photons using the feasible and robust light–matter quantum interface.

Ideally this requires control over the photon flux in a wide dynamic range, sub‐Poissonian photon statistics, and narrow‐band emission spectrum. In this work, a monochromatic SPS based on an organic dye molecule is presented, whose photon flux is traceably measured to be adjustable between 144 000 and 1320 000 photons per second at a wavelength of (785.6 ± 0.1) nm, corresponding to an optical radiant flux between 36.5 and 334 fW. The high purity of the single‐photon stream is verified, with a second‐order autocorrelation function at zero time delay below 0.1 throughout the whole range. Such molecule‐based SPS is hence used for the calibration of a single‐photon avalanche detector against a low‐noise analog photodiode traceable to the primary standard for optical radiant flux (i.e., the cryogenic radiometer). Due to the narrow bandwidth of the source, corrections to the detector efficiency arising from the spectral power distribution are negligible. With this major advantage, the developed device may finally realize a low‐photon‐flux standard source for quantum radiometry.",

A hybrid quantum local search (QLS) approach that combines a classical machine and a small quantum device to solve problems of practical size is presented. The proposed approach is applied to the network community detection problem. QLS is hardware‐agnostic and easily extendable to new quantum computing devices as they become available. It is demonstrated to solve the 2‐community detection problem on graphs of sizes of up to 410 vertices using the 16‐qubit IBM quantum computer and D‐Wave 2000Q, and compare their performance with the optimal solutions. The results herein demonstrate that QLS performs similarly in terms of quality of the solution and the number of iterations to convergence on both types of quantum computers and it is capable of achieving results comparable to state‐of‐the‐art solvers in terms of quality of the solution including reaching the optimal solutions.",

However, the performance of atomic magnetometers is often limited by hidden systematic effects that may cause misdiagnosis for a variety of applications, for example, in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and in biomagnetism. In this work, a hitherto unexplained interference effect in atomic magnetometers is uncovered, which causes an important systematic effect to greatly deteriorate the accuracy of measuring magnetic fields. A standard approach to detecting and characterizing the interference effect in, but not limited to, atomic magnetometers is presented. As applications of the work, the effect of the interference in NMR structural determination and locating the brain electrophysiological symptom is considered, and it is shown that it will help to improve the measurement accuracy by taking interference effects into account. Through the experiments, good agreement is indeed found between the prediction and the asymmetric amplitudes of resonant lines in ultralow‐field NMR spectra—an effect that has not been understood so far. It is anticipated that the work will stimulate interesting new researches for magnetic interference phenomena in a wide range of magnetometers and their applications.",

The excitation, control, and detection of spin waves by metal electrodes is crucial for interfacing these devices to electrical circuits. As such, it is important to understand metal‐induced damping of spin‐wave transport, but characterizing this process requires access to the underlying magnetic films. Here it is shown that electronic sensor spins in diamond enable imaging of spin waves that propagate underneath metals in magnetic insulators. This capability is then used to reveal a 100‐fold metal‐induced increase in spin‐wave damping. The damping enhancement is attributed to spin‐wave‐induced electrical currents as well as, above a certain frequency, three‐magnon scattering processes. This interpretation is supported by deriving expressions for the current‐induced damping and the three‐magnon threshold from the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation that agree well with the observations. The detection of buried scattering centers further highlights the technique's power for assessing spintronic device quality. These results open new avenues for studying metal – spin‐wave interactions and provide access to interfacial processes such as spin‐wave injection via the spin‐Hall effect.",

Recently, Lloyd et al. have advanced the proposal to embed classical data into quantum ones: these live in the more complex Hilbert space where they can get split into linearly separable clusters. Here, these ideas are implemented by engineering two different experimental platforms, based on quantum optics and ultra‐cold atoms, respectively, where we adapt and numerically optimize the quantum embedding protocol by deep learning methods, and test it for some trial classical data. A similar analysis is also performed on the Rigetti superconducting quantum computer. Therefore, it is found that the quantum embedding approach successfully works also at the experimental level and, in particular, we show how different platforms could work in a complementary fashion to achieve this task. These studies might pave the way for future investigations on quantum machine learning techniques especially based on hybrid quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As quantum technologies advance, the ability to generate increasingly large quantum states has experienced rapid development. In this context, the verification and estimation of large entangled systems represent one of the main challenges in the employment of such systems for reliable quantum information processing. Though the most complete technique is undoubtedly full tomography, the inherent exponential increase of experimental and post‐processing resources with system size makes this approach infeasible even at moderate scales. For this reason, there is currently an urgent need to develop novel methods that surpass these limitations. This review article presents novel techniques focusing on a fixed number of resources (sampling complexity), and thus prove suitable for systems of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, a probabilistic framework requiring at best only a single copy for entanglement detection is reviewed, together with the concept of selective quantum state tomography, which enables the estimation of arbitrary elements of an unknown state with a number of copies that is low and independent of the system's size. These hyper‐efficient techniques define a dimensional demarcation for partial tomography and open a path for novel applications.",

Currently, three of the leading candidate platforms for quantum computing are based on superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and neutral atom arrays. However, these systems have strong interaction with environmental and control noises that introduce decoherence of qubit states and gate operations. Alternatively, photons are well decoupled from the environment, and have advantages of speed and timing for distributed quantum computing. Photonic systems have already demonstrated capability for solving specific intractable problems like Boson sampling, but face challenges for practically scalable universal quantum computing solutions because it is extremely difficult for a single photon to \"talk\" to another deterministically. Here, we propose a universal distributed quantum computing scheme based on photons and atomic-ensemble-based quantum memories. Taking the established photonic advantages, we mediate two-qubit nonlinear interaction by converting photonic qubits into quantum memory states and employing Rydberg blockade for controlled gate operation. We further demonstrate spatial and temporal scalability of this scheme. Our results show photon-atom network hybrid approach can be an alternative solution to universal quantum computing.",

It is a key factor for successful and practical quantum algorithm implementations in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Since quantum‐classical hybrid algorithms can be executed with moderate and noisy quantum resources, combining QEM with quantum‐classical hybrid schemes is one of the most promising directions toward practical quantum advantages. This work shows how the variational quantum‐neural hybrid eigensolver (VQNHE) algorithm, which seamlessly combines the expressive power of a parameterized quantum circuit with a neural network, is inherently noise resilient with a unique QEM capacity, which is absent in vanilla variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE). The study carefully analyzes and elucidates the asymptotic scaling of this unique QEM capacity in VQNHE from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Finally, a variational basis transformation is proposed for the Hamiltonian to be measured under the VQNHE framework, yielding a powerful tri‐optimization setup, dubbed as VQNHE++. VQNHE++ can further enhance the quantum‐neural hybrid expressive power and error mitigation capacity.",

The nuclear spin in such systems is significantly impacted by the electron spin when the main magnetic field approaches the Fermi contact field of nuclear spin, leading to measurement inaccuracies. A comprehensive dynamics model of the electron‐nuclear spin coupling ensemble has been established and analyzed. It proposes that the primary magnetic field augmenting effectively disentangles the precession frequency of the two spin‐coupling species, thereby yielding a spin‐decoupled state. Such a state allows nuclear spin serves as a high sensitive element for magnetic field measurements, while electron spin serves as a probe to acquire the precession of nuclear spin. With proposed method, a magnetic field resolution of 0.75 nT in a 12000 nT environment is achieved, indicating potential for magnetic field detection in geomagnetic environments. It further demonstrates measurements of electron spin Fermi contact interaction and polarization based on spin‐decoupling and in situ nuclear spin precession, results indicate measurement errors close to 1%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the accuracy and sensitivity of magnetic field measurements in spin‐coupled systems such as co‐magnetometers, nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes, and nuclear magnetometers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Entanglement concentration serves as an essential tool to obtain the maximally entangled states from the less‐entangled states in quantum information processing tasks. An efficient two‐step entanglement concentration protocol (ECP) is proposed to concentrate the less‐entangled four‐photon cluster states with four unknown coefficients into the maximally entangled states in this paper. The protocol utilizes parity‐check gate and photon‐polarized controlled‐Z gate, constructed with a single semiconductor quantum dot in a single optical microcavity (quantum dot‐cavity coupled system) and several linear optical elements. The discarded quantum states can be recycled in the next round concentration to achieve a higher success probability. Under conditions of strong coupling and weak side leakage rate, the ECP can tend toward ideal fidelity and efficiency. Compared to the previously proposed ECPs that utilize various auxiliary tools such as additional entangled states and complex quantum logic gates, the ECP significantly simplifies the analysis process and enables efficient implementation. Thus, the ECP is more economical and feasible in future optical systems.",

On the other hand, the analytical methods developed and results obtained from the integrable systems provide deep insights on the many‐body system. Quantum simulation of the integrable system not only provides a valid benchmark for quantum computers but is also the first step in studying integrable‐breaking systems. The building block for the simulation of an integrable system is the Yang–Baxter gate. It is vital to know how to optimally realize the Yang–Baxter gates on quantum computers. Based on the geometric picture of the Yang–Baxter gates, the optimal realizations of two types of Yang–Baxter gates with a minimal number of controlled NOT (CNOT) or gates are presented. It is also shown how to systematically realize the Yang–Baxter gates via the pulse control. The different realizations on IBM quantum computers are tested and compared. It is found that the pulse realizations of the Yang–Baxter gates always have a higher gate fidelity compared to the optimal CNOT or realizations. On the basis of the above optimal realizations, the simulation of the Yang–Baxter equation on quantum computers is demonstrated. These results provide a guideline and standard for further experimental studies based on the Yang–Baxter gate.",

The results show that non‐Gaussian operations can enhance teleportation fidelity in a dissipative environment.

Despite recent advancements in vector atomic magnetometers, they often face issues that hinder practical use. To overcome this, a high dynamic range single‐beam vector atomic magnetometer based on the nonlinear magneto‐optical rotation (NMOR) effect is proposed, utilizing a closed‐loop system with applied three‐axis modulation magnetic fields. In this method, closed‐loop measurement is achieved using a phase‐locked loop (PLL), with the frequencies of the applied modulation magnetic fields being significantly higher than the response bandwidth of the PLL. This allows directional information to be extracted from the modulation fields response signal and magnitude information from the PLL‐locked frequency. A theoretical analysis of the proposed method is conducted by establishing an NMOR atomic magnetometer model under arbitrary magnetic field directions and deriving the method for obtaining the magnetic field direction. In further experimental validation, it is demonstrated that the vector atomic magnetometer can achieve measurement of three‐axis vector magnetic fields, with a sensitivity of approximately for magnetic field magnitude, for inclination angle, and for azimuth angle.",

A notable example is the use of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), implemented as specific types of quantum circuits, to recognize phases of matter. In this approach, ground states of many‐body Hamiltonians are prepared to form a quantum dataset and classified in a supervised manner using only a few labeled examples. However, this type of dataset and model differs fundamentally from typical QML paradigms based on feature maps and parameterized circuits. In this study, how models utilizing quantum data can be interpreted through hidden feature maps, where physical features are implicitly embedded via ground‐state feature maps is demonstrated. By analyzing selected examples as case studies for understanding QCNNs, it is shown that high performance in quantum phase recognition comes from generating a highly effective basis set with sharp features at critical points. The learning process adapts the measurement to create sharp decision boundaries. The analysis highlights improved generalization when working with quantum data, particularly in the limited‐shots regime. Furthermore, translating these insights into the domain of quantum scientific machine learning, it is demonstrated that ground‐state feature maps can be applied to fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Convolutional neural network (CNN), as a prominent machine learning model, is crucial in image classification and feature extraction by completely utilizing the correlation information of data. Currently, the CNN is facing the challenges of slow computing speed, expanding data scale and poor interpretation for rapidly increasing Hilbert space. Fortunately, quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) promises an elegant solution to improve the efficiency of data processing by combining the superiority of quantum computing and the feature extraction capability of the CNN. However, most of the existing QCNNs have the problem that they are feeble to extract global features effectively and coincidentally variational shadow quantum circuit (VSQC) can preferably figure out it. Accordingly, an enhanced QCNN assisted by the VSQC (VSQC‐QCNN) is developed. To be specific, the input data is primarily preprocessed by the VSQC module to establish global entanglement and extract effective features. Then the output shadow features are further processed by encoding, quantum circuit evolution and decoding through quantum convolutional layer and the dimensionality of the feature results is reduced through the pooling layer. When the data dimension is small enough, it is fed into a fully connected neural network to make classification predictions via activation functions. Experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset through the VQNet quantum framework demonstrate that the VSQC‐QCNN model is with performance surpassing the original QCNN in terms of loss function, classification accuracy and training speed. In addition, it is proved that the VSQC‐QCNN model has good astringency and stability under different circuit depths, widths and learning rates. Remarkably, the classification average accuracy of the model can reach up to 99% (even 100% for a few cases). Finally, experiments are also performed on Fashion‐MNIST and Iris datasets, indicating that the designed model has good universality.",

The dead zone model is developed for NMOR atomic magnetometer from the mechanism of interaction between optical field and polarized atoms. To eliminate the dead zone of NMOR atomic magnetometer, the response model with dual‐axis magnetic pulse excitation is established by using the density matrix theory for bias magnetic field in arbitrary direction. Then the proposed method of suppressing the dead zone is examined in the experiment, which is in agreement with the developed model.

The results further show that the mechanical mode coupled to the cavity can achieve squeezing effect in the selected magnetic field direction, but not in the opposite one. Moreover, by properly adjusting the magnon effective detuning and the Kerr effect strength, the degree of squeezing of the mechanical mode can even beyond the 3‐dB limit, and the optimal conditions for generating stronger squeezing are obtained.

The observed multi–stability cannot be derived from any master equation that linearly depends on the spins' reduced density operator. Traditionally, the nonlinearity that is required in order to theoretically account for the observed multi–stability is introduced by implementing the method of Bosonization. Here, an alternative explanation, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems is explored. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a master equation having an added nonlinear term, which deterministically generates disentanglement. Experimental results are compared with predictions derived from both competing theoretical models. It is found that better agreement with data is obtained from the disentanglement–based model. This finding, together with a difficulty to justify the Bosonization–based model, indirectly support the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The distribution relationship of quantum battery capacity is investigated. First, it is proved that for two‐qubit ‐states, the sum of the subsystem battery capacities does not exceed the total system's battery capacity, and the conditions are provided under which they are equal. Then define the difference between the total system's and subsystems' battery capacities as the residual battery capacity () and show that this can be divided into coherent and incoherent components. Furthermore, it is observed that this capacity monogamy relation for quantum batteries extends to general ‐qubit states and any ‐qubit state's battery capacity distribution can be optimized to achieve capacity gain through an appropriate global unitary evolution. Specifically, for general three‐qubit states, stronger distributive relations are derived for battery capacity. Quantum batteries are believed to hold significant potential for outperforming classical counterparts in the future. These findings contribute to the development and enhancement of quantum battery theory.",

Currently quantum repeater schemes typically aim to distribute one ebit at a time, the equivalent of one Bell pair's worth of entanglement. Here, a scheme is presented to distribute a macroscopic amount of entanglement across long‐distances using a number of operations that scales only linearly with the chain length in the ideal case (without decoherence). The scheme involves ensembles of qubits and entangling them with an interaction, which can be realized using atomic gas ensembles coupled by a shared optical mode. Using only local measurements on the intermediate ensembles, this leaves the ensembles at the ends of the chain entangled. It is showed that there are particular “magic” interaction times that allow for distribution of entanglement with perfect fidelity, with no degradation with chain length. The scheme is deterministic, such that with suitable local conditional unitary corrections, the same entangled state can always be prepared with good approximation.",

However, imperfect components of practical QKD systems offer avenues for eavesdropping, while the limited payload capacity and vibrations of UAVs present substantial challenges. This paper introduces an orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoding strategy combined with decoy‐state and the measurement‐device‐independent QKD (MDI‐QKD) protocol to address security issues and reference frame misalignment in UAV‐based QKD systems. Nevertheless, the communication performance of the OAM‐MDI‐QKD system is significantly affected by complex environmental challenges in the airborne channel. To improve the degraded communication performance in airborne platforms, an enhanced grey wolf optimization‐differential evolution (GWO‐DE) algorithm is developed, utilizing chaotic mapping and a nonlinear decay factor to strengthen global search and convergence capabilities, which effectively addresses the search limitations of local search algorithms (LSA) when dealing with high‐dimensional objective functions. Simulation results demonstrate that the GWO‐DE algorithm outperforms other traditional optimization algorithms in terms of optimization precision and transmission distance enhancement, with computational speed meeting system requirements.",

Worse yet, no estimation of (i.e., the success probability of dishonest database's cheating) has been given till now. Such estimation is quite necessary because a significant means frangible user privacy especially in the cheat‐sensitive security model. Here, of the first and best‐known quantum‐key‐distribution (QKD)‐based QPQ protocol proposed by Jakobi et al. is estimated, which shows that dishonest database can elicit user privacy with significant probability (e.g., as high as 42.8% for database size ) while such cheating can only be (delayedly) detected with probability 50 %. Common strategy to improve user privacy, i.e., adding honesty checking to detect malicious database may hurt the privacy of the other party, i.e. database security. To solve this problem, a new group honesty checking is proposed, which will not hurt database security and can reduce $ to a very small value (e.g. 0.26% for database size 10000), thus assuring high user privacy (note that = 0 means ideal user privacy).",

In order to implement such concepts development of well‐defined assemblies that enable energy transfer, mass, and charge transports across several length scales is necessary. Herein it is reported that multilayer molecular moiré superlattices may provide an initial direction for attaining the abovementioned objectives. For example, multilayered 2D moiré superlattices of p‐phenylenediamine showed easily identifiable twist angle‐dependent electrical conductivity at each interface, as measured for the nanosheet using conductive atomic force microscopy. The absence of water molecules at the interfaces, as compared to the layered water molecules in the lattices, lowered the electron tunneling barrier and thus, increased the conductivity. Importantly, protonation and deprotonation of the superlattices in the dispersion resulted in high interfacial currents with about three orders of magnitude increase for the former. These results are further explained by density of states calculations along with carrier density and simulated scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) plots.",

Recently, the exponential growth of out‐of‐time‐ordered correlator (OTOC) has been proposed to diagnose quantum chaos and verify the correspondence principle. Here, good correspondence is found between the linear entanglement entropy and the semiclassical phase space structures in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. The Loschmidt echo in the chaotic sea decays more faster than that in the stable island. However, the OTOCs grow exponentially at early times for the initial states centered both in the chaotic and stable regions. The exponential growth of the OTOC is attributed to quantum collapse that provides a novel mechanism of yielding exponential growth of the OTOC in quantum systems. Moreover, the quantum collapse effect is more obvious for the initial states centered in the chaotic one. The results show that in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model, the linear entanglement entropy, and Loschmidt echo are more effective than OTOC for diagnosing quantum chaotic signals.",

However, the presence of residual gradient fields could introduce additional spin‐exchange relaxation, which will attenuate the response of the magnetometer. Consequently, it is crucial to compensate these residual gradients for maintaining high sensitivity and accuracy in SERF magnetometers. This study developed an optimized technique that leveraged both gradient and homogeneous coils to rapidly mitigate position‐dependent gradients. By applying adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimization, the quadratic loss function is efficiently solved and the optimal current is determined. This experiment demonstrated over 90% suppression of the residual fields and a significant reduction in the inter‐channel deviations by an order of magnitude. In a simulated large gradient field environment, the sensitivities of multi‐channel magnetometers improved from 100 to 15 after compensation. The proposed method showcased substantial enhancements in residual homogeneity and sensor sensitivity, underscoring its efficiency. Compared with nested coil approaches, the coordinated use of gradient and homogeneous coils, along with Adam optimization, offered a robust, efficient, and rapid solution for gradient compensation. The proposed method effectively mitigated the adverse effects of residual fields and enhanced the performance of multi‐channel SERF magnetometers. Importantly, this approach represents a more practical solution for gradient field compensation within a single cell, particularly for future commercial applications of array SERF magnetometers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is showed how to generate and control the one‐way optomechanical steering in an optomagnomechanical system. In the scheme, the magnetostriction‐induced deformation displacement of a ferrimagnet couples to an optical cavity by radiation‐pressure interaction. The optical cavity resonates with the Stokes sideband of the laser drive field, leading to the optomechanical parametric down‐conversion interaction. The magnon mode resonates with the anti‐Stokes sideband of the microwave drive field, thereby cooling the mechanical motion. By adjusting the detuning between the magnon mode and the microwave drive field, we show the relative steady‐state population numbers of photons and phonons will be changed, therefore, the direction of the optomechanical steering can be controlled. The control of the quantum steering in this scheme does not require the introduction of additional dissipation and damping of the entangled parties, which means the one‐way steering can be generated with low mechanical damping, and has strong robustness against thermal noise. This finding may provide a novel platform to generate and control quantum steering in hybrid quantum system.",

Based on the analysis, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided to uniquely identify the target state under noisy measurements. Moreover, this work proposes a symmetric hypothesis testing verification algorithm with noisy measurements. Then, relying on states, a semidefinite program is demonstrated to calculate the infidelity threshold for arbitrary measurement noise. Subsequently, using a noisy nonadaptive verification strategy of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger and stabilizer states, the noise effects on the verification efficiency are analytically illustrated. From both analytical and numerical perspectives, this work demonstrates that the noisy verification protocol exhibits a negative quadratic relationship between the sample complexity and the infidelity.

Variational quantum algorithms are crucial methods to implement quantum computing, and an appropriate task‐specific quantum circuit ansatz can effectively enhance the quantum advantage of VQAs. However, the vast search space makes it challenging to find the optimal task‐specific ansatz. Expressibility, quantifying the diversity of quantum circuit ansatz states to explore the Hilbert space effectively, can be used to evaluate whether one ansatz is superior to another. In this work, using a transformer model to predict the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze is proposed. A dataset containing random PQCs generated by the gatewise pipeline, with varying numbers of qubits and gates is constructed. The expressibility of the circuits is calculated using three measures: KL divergence, relative KL divergence, and maximum mean discrepancy. A transformer model is trained on the dataset to capture the intricate relationships between circuit characteristics and expressibility. Four evaluation metrics are employed to assess the performance of the transformer. Numerical results demonstrate that the trained model achieves high performance and robustness across various expressibility measures. This research can enhance the understanding of the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze and advance quantum architecture search algorithms.",

These intersections are identified through this transcendental function. EPs emerge between pairs of adjacent excited energy levels, shifting toward lower coupling strengths as energy levels increase, and can also be predicted by a generalized rotating‐wave approximation approach. The fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with recent findings in non‐Hermitian systems, while it diverges to positive infinity at the doubly degenerate points.

Radiation trapping is one of the dominant mechanisms exacerbating spin relaxation in alkali‐metal atoms and is conventionally suppressed by introducing nitrogen () as a quenching agent. However, experiments reveal that the typical concentration in current SERF co‐magnetometers is insufficient to effectively suppress radiation trapping. By increasing the quenching gas concentration, additional attenuation of the radiation trapping effect is achieved. Meanwhile, to address the enhanced spin‐exchange collision relaxation arising from higher concentration, the operating temperature is adjusted to increase the alkali‐metal atom number density, thereby effectively curtailing this adverse effect. Experimental results demonstrate that the synergistic optimization of concentration and temperature reduces alkali‐metal spin relaxation by approximately 55% and decreases the noise power spectral density of the co‐magnetometer by 48.5% at 1 Hz. These findings confirm the effectiveness of this approach in improving the accuracy and sensitivity of SERF co‐magnetometers.",

Then proposed, for the first time, a T‐shaped SOTPC‐based topological polarization beam splitter (TPBS) and validate the ability of this TPBS to effectively separate TM and TE modes over a broad operating bandwidth. Ultrahigh extinction ratios of 108 dB for TM polarization and 112 dB for TE polarization are simultaneously achieved at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the polarization beam splitting effect, along with the corresponding performance of the TPBS, exhibits significant robustness against structural defects. Given the excellent features of the proposed TPBS, such as very compact footprint, ultrahigh extinction ratios and wide operating bandwidth, its potential is anticipated as a promising platform for applications in polarization multiplexing photonic integrated circuits and optical communication systems.",

The energetic cost is theoretically defined, and thereby, the gradient of the energetic cost for pulse engineering is derived. The Pareto optimality is empirically demonstrated in the trade‐off between process fidelity and energetic cost. Thereafter, two novel numerical quantum optimal control approaches are proposed: i) energy‐optimized gradient ascent pulse engineering (EO‐GRAPE) as an open‐loop gradient‐based method, and ii) energy‐optimized deep reinforcement learning for pulse engineering (EO‐DRLPE) as a closed‐loop method. The performance of both methods is probed in the presence of increasing noise. It is found that the EO‐GRAPE method performs better than the EO‐DRLPE methods with and without a warm start for most experimental settings. Additionally, for one qubit unitary gate, the correlation between the Bloch sphere path length and the energetic cost is illustrated.",

This paper introduces a robust, modulation‐free frame synchronization method tailored for passive LLO CVQKD systems. This method leverages the complex cross‐correlation of quantum signals exchanged between Alice and Bob for synchronization purposes. Validated through an analytical model and numerical simulations, this approach demonstrates high synchronization success rates, robustness to noise, and resilience to both slow phase drifts between local oscillators and quantum signals and fast phase drifts stemming from two independent lasers.

In this study, the key rate bound for the decoy‐state method is refined and enhanced and introduce an improved statistical fluctuation analysis framework. By integrating the refined bound with this advanced fluctuation analysis, higher key generation rates are achieved, as demonstrated in numerical simulations of the one‐decoy‐state method — a simple yet increasingly practical protocol — under typical experimental conditions.

By considering two models, namely the Field‐quantum battery and the Cavity–Heisenberg quantum battery, the relationship is analyzed among quantum steering, quantum entanglement, energy storage, and extractable work. It is found that within the steerable range, the quantum steering of different qubits has a maximum or minimum value, which corresponds to the energy storage of the battery. Moreover, this maximum or minimum value of quantum steering also corresponds to the maximum value of the extractable work. The minimum of quantum entanglement always coincides with the maximum of parameters like energy storage. Ultimately, the reasons for these results are analyzed by analyzing the purity of the system and discover a relatively general conclusion: when the purity is at its maximum, important parameters such as the energy storage of the battery are also at their maximum.",

In this study, a machine learning based parameter optimization approach is proposed for the Gaussian‐modulated CV‐QKD system. The proposed approach adopts the genetic algorithm backpropagation (GA‐BP) based approach to enhance the secret key rate by optimize parameters of the CV‐QKD system. Furthermore, under certain assumptions, some theoretical results are established, which enables us to identify the maximum secret key rate under a given GA‐BP network. Based on these results, a bisection based method is proposed that can effectively find the optimal modulation variance and the corresponding maximum secret key rate. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve a higher secret key rate than the conventional methods under the numerical settings.",

This allows reliable detection of terahertz information using a standard CMOS camera without cooling while still achieving spatial resolution close to the terahertz wavelength.

Exploiting this loophole, a quantum hacking strategy called the induced‐photorefraction attack is proposed. This strategy utilizes the induced photorefraction on the LN‐based modulators to conceal a classical intercept‐resend attack. Specifically, the induced photorefraction biases the response curve of the LN‐based modulator, which affects the intensity of the modulated signal. Based on the investigation of channel parameter estimation and the analysis of the secret key rate of the practical CVQKD system, the simulation results show that the communication parties overestimate the secret key rate, which reveals that Eve can actively open a security loophole via the induced‐photorefraction attack to obtain secret key information. To defend against this attack, a random monitoring scheme for modulation variance is proposed to detect the attack, along with an improved optical power limiter to mitigate the irradiation beam. Additionally, a Sagnac‐based IM is suggested to stabilize the practical CVQKD system. Furthermore, the impact of this attack is analyzed on continuous‐variable measurement‐device‐independent QKD systems ((CV‐MDI‐QKD) and on local‐local‐oscillator (LLO) systems and propose countermeasures for each. Finally, the passive‐state‐preparation CVQKD protocol is proposed to fundamentally close the security loopholes originating from the modulators.",

In the antiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of distributions, including facial‐makeup states, petal states, topological fissure states, multiple‐half‐ring states and property‐distinguished vertical and horizontal stripe states. A peculiar phenomenon of density‐phase separation is noticed in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be independent.

In the monolayer limit, TiSe 2 exhibits a sizable energy gap in the CDW phase that makes it a promising quantum material. It is shown that interfacing a single layer of TiSe 2 with dissimilar van der Waals materials enables control of its properties. Using angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the energy gap opening is analyzed as a function of temperature for TiSe 2 monolayers supported on different van der Waals substrates. A substantial increase in the CDW transition temperature of ≈45 K is observed on MoS 2 compared to graphite (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) substrates. This control of the CDW in monolayer TiSe 2 is suggested to arise from varying charge screening of the unconventional CDW of TiSe 2 by the substrate. In addition, the suppression of CDW order and a complete closing of the energy gap by electron doping of monolayer TiSe 2 is demonstrated. Regulating the many‐body physics phenomena in monolayer TiSe 2 lays the foundation of modifying TiSe 2 in, for example, artificial van der Waals heterostructures and thus creates a new approach for utilizing the quantum states of TiSe 2 in device applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The bid for scalable physical qubits has attracted many possible candidate platforms. In particular, spin‐based qubits in solid‐state form factors are attractive as they could potentially benefit from processes similar to those used for conventional semiconductor processing. However, material control is a significant challenge for solid‐state spin qubits as residual spins from substrate, dielectric, electrodes, or contaminants from processing contribute to spin decoherence. In the recent decade, valleytronics has seen a revival due to the discovery of valley‐coupled spins in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Such valley‐coupled spins are protected by inversion asymmetry and time reversal symmetry and are promising candidates for robust qubits. In this report, the progress toward building such qubits is presented. Following an introduction to the key attractions in fabricating such qubits, an up‐to‐date brief is provided for the status of each key step, highlighting advancements made and/or outstanding work to be done. This report concludes with a perspective on future development highlighting major remaining milestones toward scalable spin‐valley qubits.",

A measure based on this simple geometric picture that separates angle and length mismatch into individual terms is introduced and the ensuing optimization framework is applied to maximize squeezing of an optomechanical oscillator at finite temperature. The results herein show that shaping the cavity drives can speed up squeezed state preparation by more than two orders of magnitude.

However, quantum‐coherent photonic control of solid‐state emitters has traditionally been limited to cryogenic environments, which are not compatible with implementation in scalable, broadly distributed technologies. In contrast, plasmonic nano‐cavities with deep sub‐wavelength mode volumes have recently emerged as a path toward room temperature quantum control. However, optimization, control, and modeling of the cavity mode volume are still in their infancy. Here recent demonstrations of plasmonic tip‐enhanced strong coupling (TESC) with a configurable nano‐tip cavity are extended to perform a systematic experimental investigation of the cavity‐emitter interaction strength and its dependence on tip position, augmented by modeling based on both classical electrodynamics and a quasinormal mode framework. Based on this work, a perspective for nano‐cavity optics is provided as a promising tool for room temperature control of quantum coherent interactions that could spark new innovations in fields from quantum information and quantum sensing to quantum chemistry and molecular opto‐mechanics.",

Ions are assumed to be individually addressed, permitting optimization over amplitude‐ and phase‐modulated controls. Calculations and simulations demonstrate that the inclusion of modulation of the difference phase for the bichromatic drive used in the Mølmer–Sørensen gate permits approximately time‐optimal control across a range of gate configurations, and when suitably combined with analytic constraints can also provide robustness against key experimental sources of error. The impact of experimental constraints such as bounds on coupling rates or modulation band‐limits on achievable performance is further demonstrated. Using a custom optimization engine based on TensorFlow, for optimizations on ion registers up to 20 ions, time‐to‐solution of order tens of minutes using a local‐instance laptop is also demonstrated, allowing computational access to system‐scales relevant to near‐term trapped‐ion devices.",

The discovery of emergent quantum phenomena and their applications in active photonic quantum technologies have been dominated by work with single atoms, self‐assembled quantum dots, or single solid‐state defects.

Solution‐processed quantum materials are uniquely positioned to address this challenge, but the quantum properties of these materials have remained generally inferior to those of solid‐state emitters or atoms. Additionally, systematic integration of solution‐processed materials with dielectric nanophotonic structures has been rare compared to other solid‐state systems.

While conventionally the ground state has a second‐order quantum phase transition in the low frequency limit, turning on finite frequencies sheds a novel light on the phase diagram to illuminate a fine structure of first‐order transition series. It is found that the conventional quantum phase transition is accompanied with a hidden symmetry breaking, whereas the emerging series transitions are topological transitions without symmetry breaking. The topological structure of the wave function provides a novel universality classification in bridging the QRM and the JCM among the diversity that arises from finite frequencies. The aspect of topological transitions provides a renewed insight for the role of the counter‐rotating interaction. Moreover, it is shown that the conventionally established tricritical point is actually a pentacritical or hexacritical point and following this multicritical point emerges a series of quadruple points. Besides the emerging multicriticality and reformed universality, the result demonstrates that a single‐qubit system can even exhibit analogs of topological phase transitions which traditionally occur in condensed matter.",

Here, the electronic structure of InAs(001), InAs(111), and InSb(110) surfaces is studied using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Large‐scale first principles simulations are enabled by using DFT calculations with a machine‐learned Hubbard U correction [npj Comput. Mater. 6, 180 (2020)]. To facilitate direct comparison with ARPES results, a “bulk unfolding” scheme is implemented by projecting the calculated band structure of a supercell surface slab model onto the bulk primitive cell. For all three surfaces, a good agreement is found between DFT calculations and ARPES. For InAs(001), the simulations clarify the effect of the surface reconstruction. Different reconstructions are found to produce distinctive surface states, which may be detected by ARPES with low photon energies. For InAs(111) and InSb(110), the simulations help elucidate the effect of oxidation. Owing to larger charge transfer from As to O than from Sb to O, oxidation of InAs(111) leads to significant band bending and produces an electron pocket, whereas oxidation of InSb(110) does not. The combined theoretical and experimental results may inform the design of quantum devices based on InAs and InSb semiconductors, for example, topological qubits utilizing the Majorana zero modes.",

    "abstract": "Conventionally the occurrence of topological phase transitions (TPTs) requires gap closing, whereas there are also unconventional cases without need of gap closing. Although traditionally TPTs lie in many-body systems in condensed matter, both cases of TPTs may find analogs in few-body systems. Indeed, the ground-state node number provides a topological classification for single-qubit systems. While the no-node theorem of spinless systems is shown to also restrict the fundamental quantum Rabi model in light-matter interactions, it is demonstrated that the limitation of the no-node theorem can be broken not only in a small counter-rotating term (CRT) but also in the large-CRT regime, which striates a rich phase diagram with different TPTs. While these transitions are mostly accompanied with gap closing and parity reversal, a hidden node-phase transition is revealed that has neither gap closing nor parity change, which turns out to be an analog of the unconventional TPT in condensed matter. A hysteresis sign for the unconventional TPT is unveiled via the transition from amplitude squeezing to phase squeezing in the gapped phase. The imprints in the Wigner function are also addressed. The clarified mechanisms provide some special insights for the subtle role of the CRT.",

Different post‐implantation annealing conditions are explored for the optimal activation of GeV centers, namely, 900 °C 2 h, 1000 °C 10 h, 1500 °C 1 h under high vacuum, and 2000 °C 15 min at 6 GPa pressure.

The main performance parameter adopted here to describe the excitation efficiency of GeV centers as single‐photon emitters is the ratio between the saturation optical excitation power and the emission intensity at saturation.

    "abstract": "Abstract The spectral properties of a non‐Hermitian quasi‐1D lattice in two of the possible dimerization configurations are investigated. Specifically, it focuses on a non‐Hermitian diamond chain that presents a zero‐energy flat band. The flat band originates from wave interference and results in eigenstates with a finite contribution only on two sites of the unit cell. To achieve the non‐Hermitian characteristics, the system under study presents non‐reciprocal hopping terms in the chain. This leads to the accumulation of eigenstates on the boundary of the system, known as the non‐Hermitian skin effect. Despite this accumulation of eigenstates, for one of the two considered configurations, it is possible to characterize the presence of non‐trivial edge states at zero energy by a real‐space topological invariant known as the biorthogonal polarization. This work shows that this invariant, evaluated using the destructive interference method, characterizes the non‐trivial phase of the non‐Hermitian diamond chain. For the second non‐Hermitian configuration, there is a finite quantum metric associated with the flat band. Additionally, the system presents the skin effect despite the system having a purely real or imaginary spectrum. The two non‐Hermitian diamond chains can be mapped into two models of the Su‐Schrieffer‐Heeger chains, either non‐Hermitian, and Hermitian, both in the presence of a flat band.

The investigated devices are designed and monolithically fabricated on an (Al)GaAs heterostructure. Radio frequency elastic waves with frequencies ranging between $f$=250 MHz to 400 MHz are generated as Rayleigh surface acoustic waves on the unpatterned substrate and injected as Lamb waves in the nanophononic string. Quantum dots inside the nanophononic string exhibit a 15-fold enhanced optomechanical modulation compared to those dynamically strained by the Rayleigh surface acoustic wave. Detailed finite element simulations of the phononic mode spectrum of the nanophononic string confirm, that the observed modulation arises from valence band deformation potential coupling via shear strain. The corresponding optomechanical coupling parameter is quantified to $0.15 \\mathrm{meV nm^{-1}}$. This value exceeds that reported for vibrating nanorods by approximately one order of magnitude at 100 times higher frequencies. Using this value, a derive vertical displacements in the range of 10 nm is deduced from the experimentally observed modulation. The results represent an important step towards the creation of large scale optomechanical circuits interfacing single optically active quantum dots with optical and mechanical waves.",

In this paper, different ways in which these systems can be used to study the interplay between flat band dynamics, topology, and interactions in a well‐known quasi‐1D topological insulator—the Creutz ladder—are suggested. First, a simple experimental protocol is proposed to observe the Aharonov–Bohm localization in the noninteracting system, and the different experimental setups that might be used for this are reviewed. The inclusion of a repulsive Hubbard‐type interaction term, which can give rise to repulsively bound pairs termed doublons, is then considered. The dynamics of these quasiparticles are studied for different points of the phase diagram, including a regime in which pairs are localized and particles are free to move. Finally, a scheme for the photonic implementation of a two‐particle bosonic Creutz‐Hubbard model is presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The successful development of future photonic quantum technologies will much depend on the possibility of realizing robust and scalable nanophotonic devices. These should include quantum emitters like on‐demand single‐photon sources and non‐linear elements, provided their transition linewidth is broadened only by spontaneous emission. However, conventional strategies to on‐chip integration, based on lithographic processes in semiconductors, are typically detrimental to the coherence properties of the emitter. Moreover, such approaches are difficult to scale and bear limitations in terms of geometries. Here an alternative platform is discussed, based on molecules that preserve near‐Fourier‐limited fluorescence even when embedded in polymeric photonic structures. 3D patterns are achieved via direct laser writing around selected molecular emitters, with a fast, inexpensive, and scalable fabrication process. By using an integrated polymeric design, detected photon counts of about 2.4 Mcps from a single cold molecule are reported. The proposed technology will allow for competitive organic quantum devices, including integrated multi‐photon interferometers, arrays of indistinguishable single‐photon sources, and hybrid electro‐optical nanophotonic chips.",

Further, excellent properties such as entangled multiqubit states, high security, flexibility, and information capacity are observed as the increased number of photons is manipulated, in turn increasing the need for a multiple‐body quantum information process. Here, a novel method is proposed to generate natural narrowband three‐body photons of W state, entangled in time (or energy) via a single step of six‐wave mixing process (SWMP). Emphasizing on the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of the SWMP, the properties of temporal correlation of the generated triphoton in the photon coincidence counting measurements are studied. Based on the photon–atom interfaces, these susceptibilities compete or coexist with each other. Meanwhile, in a dressed‐state picture, the nonlinear susceptibility decides the temporal correlation of the triphoton wave packet as damped multiperiodic Rabi oscillation, suggesting the property of the high‐dimensional time−energy entangled triphoton state. Moreover, combining the topology energy level constructions with the optical responses is a significant method for investigating the peculiarity in the temporal correlation of the generated three‐body photons.",

Experimental results reveal that Nd exists in the form of trivalent state when the doping concentration is below 5 at% and a variety of defects, such as sulfur and molybdenum vacancies, are formed in Nd‐doped MoS 2 . Compared to pure MoS 2 that only shows diamagnetism, Nd doping successfully induces room‐temperature ferromagnetic ordering. Extremely high magnetization (1640 emu cm −3 ) is observed in 1 at% Nd‐doped MoS 2 . First‐principles density functional theory calculations suggest that the various structural defects, including substitutions, vacancies, interstitials, antisites, and their complexes, are magnetic possessing large spin moments. The defects coupled with Nd dopants ferromagnetically may form the bound magnetic polarons to induce ferromagnetic ordering. The work has demonstrated that through defects engineering and rare earth element doping, extremely high magnetization materials can be achieved in layered structured materials. On the other hand, though the experiment work is done by implanting MoS 2 single crystals, theoretical calculations indicate that 2D MoS 2 with bilayers or a few layers can also result in ultrahigh magnetization.",

Here, a scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscope is used to image spontaneous magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of CeAlSi, a noncentrosymmetric ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal candidate. Large metastable domains are observed alongside stable ferromagnetic domains. The metastable domains most likely embody a type of frustrated or glassy magnetic phase, with excitations that may be of an emergent and exotic nature. Evidence is found that the heterogeneity of the two types of domains arises from magnetoelastic or magnetostriction effects. It is shown how these domains form, how they interact, and how they can be manipulated or stabilized with lattice strains estimated to be on picometer levels. This knowledge can be used in designing and fabricating devices made from CeAlSi and related materials for magnetic field sensing and magnetic memory applications.",

Recently, flourishing spin‐related photophysical phenomena (such as, Rashba effect, optical Stark effect, and magneto­optical effect) in perovskites and their relevant devices have experimentally been observed, attributed to huge spin‐orbital coupling effect and strong interaction of electron–photon in perovskites. However, fundamental understanding of spin‐dependent photophysics in perovskites is still at its nascent stage. In recent few years, circularly‐polarized ultrafast pump‐probe technique has pushed burgeoning development of spin‐selective photophysics in perovskites for spintronic device applications. Nevertheless, few review papers summarize this emerging field systematically, completely, and insightfully. Herein, to evoke broader attraction and research interest, recent advances in spin‐quantum dynamics in perovskites revealed by circularly‐polarized pump‐probe technique are reviewed: from the fundamentals and theories of circularly‐polarized ultrafast pump‐probe transient absorption and time‐resolved Faraday rotation spectroscopy; to the recent enlightening works on spin relaxation dynamics, spin‐selective exciton optical Stark effect, magnetic spin effect, and spin polarization dynamics.

In particular, nonlinear processes are employed to generate radiation in many frequency ranges. In plenty of these nonlinear processes, the generation of paired photons occurs — the so‐called signal and idler photons. Although this type of generation has undergone a tremendous development over the last decades, either the generated signal or the idler radiation has been used experimentally. In contrast, novel quantum‐based measurement principles enable the usage of both partners of the generated photon pairs based on their correlation. These measurement approaches have an enormous potential for future applications, as they allow to transfer information from one spectral range to another. In particular, spectral ranges where photon generation and detection is particularly challenging can benefit from this principle. Above all, these include the extreme frequency ranges, such as on the low‐frequency side the mid to far infrared or even the terahertz spectral range, but also on the high‐frequency side the ultraviolet or X‐ray spectral range. In this review article, theoretical and experimental developments based on correlated biphotons are described specifically for the extreme spectral regions.",

In this scheme, controlled rotation gates, i.e., phase shifts of the propagating light modes conditioned upon the state of an atom placed in a cavity, provide a mechanism both for the entangled‐state preparations and for the error syndrome identifications. In order to assess the performance of this repeater protocol, an explicit instance of RSBCs—multicomponent cat codes—are studied quantitatively. It is found that the total fidelity and the success probability for quantum communication over a long distance (such as 1000 km) both can almost approach unity provided a small enough elementary distance between stations (smaller than 0.1 or 0.01 km) and rather low local losses (up to 0.1%) are considered. In a quantum key distribution application, secret key rates can become correspondingly high, both per channel use, beating the repeaterless bound, and per second thanks to the relatively high clock rates of the memoryless scheme. Based upon the cavity‐QED setting, this scheme can be realized at room temperature and at optical frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optically active spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as compelling quantum sensors hosted by a two dimensional (2D) material. The photodynamics and sensitivity of spin defects are governed by their level structure and associated transition rates. These are, however, poorly understood for spin defects in hBN. Here, optical and microwave pump‐probe measurements are used to characterize the relaxation dynamics of the negatively charged boron vacancy (V B − )—the most widely‐studied spin defect in hBN. A 5‐level model is used to deduce transition rates that give rise to spin‐dependent V B − photoluminescence, and the lifetime of the V B − intersystem crossing metastable state. The obtained rates are used to simulate the magnetic field sensitivity of V B − defects and demonstrate high resolution imaging of the magnetic field generated by a single magnetic particle using optimal sensing parameters predicted by the model. The results reveal the rates that underpin V B − photodynamics, which is important for both a fundamental understanding of the V B − as a spin‐photon interface and for achieving optimal sensitivity in quantum sensing applications.",

In such a system, dissipative coupling induced by the common reservoir plays a crucial role in producing entanglements and quantum steering. The photon‐magnon‐phonon tripartite entanglement is significantly enhanced, exhibiting periodic sudden death and resurgence with the relative phase between coherent and dissipative couplings. It is revealed that the collaboration between dissipative and coherent couplings can produce entanglement and steering even in the absence of nonlinearity within the system. Moreover, the steering directivity can be controlled by adjusting the dissipative coupling strength and the relative phase. These findings are counterintuitive in terms of dissipation, which provides a novel approach for preparing quantum entanglement and manipulating quantum steering in an open system.",

Besides conventional topological transitions (TTs) at gap closing, abundant unconventional TTs including a particular one universal for different energy levels are unveiled underlying level anticrossings without gap closing by tracking the wave-function nodes. On the other hand, it is found that the nodes have a correspondence to spin windings, which not only endows the nodes a more explicit topological character in supporting single-qubit TTs but also turns the topological information physically detectable. Furthermore, hidden small-spin-knot transitions are exposed for the ground state, while more kinds of spin-knot transitions emerge in excited states including unmatched node numbers and spin winding numbers. As a surprise, frequently the spin windings produce portraits in high spiritual similarity with abstract artistic works, which demonstrates that the anisotropic QRM may be the Picasso of physical models. This signifies that art is joining the dialogue between mathematics and physics which was triggered by the milestone work of revealing integrability of the QRM.",

While QKD offers information theoretic security but limited authentication scalability, PQC facilitates scalable authentication in high density networks but is not information theoretic secure. Therefore, an ideal quantum‐safe framework should efficiently leverage the complementarity of both techniques. However, despite growing efforts in integrating both, current realizations have focused on channel authentication, and a complete cryptosystem addressing both hybrid authentication and hybrid key exchange is yet to be demonstrated. Here, an authenticated hybrid key exchange protocol is introduced that incorporates PQC and QKD in a modular and information‐theoretic secure architecture. The quantum‐safe protocol is inherently resilient to catastrophic cryptographic failures and provides both forward and post‐compromise security. As proof‐of‐concept implementation, the cryptosystem on a QKD hardware prototype is integrated, with the QKD processing, PQC key exchange and secret state masking via physical unclonable functions (PUFs) all running on a single field programmable gate array (FPGA). This work paves the way for the deployment of versatile and modular quantum‐safe networks that exploit the complementarity of PQC and QKD.",

Here, each atom is coupled to the waveguide through two coupling points.The two‐atom separate‐coupling case is studied, and 16 coupling configurations are considered for the coupling‐point distributions between the two atoms and the waveguide. Quantum master equations are derived to govern the evolution of the two atoms and characterize atomic entanglement by calculating the concurrence of the two‐atom states. It is found that the two giant‐atom entanglement depends on the coupling configurations and the coupling‐point distance of the giant atoms. In particular, the entanglement dynamics of the two giant atoms in 14 coupling configurations depend on the dimerization parameter of the SSH waveguide. According to the self‐energies of the two giant atoms, it is found that ten of these 16 coupling configurations can be divided into five pairs. It is also showed that the delayed sudden birth of entanglement between the two giant atoms is largely enhanced in these five pairs of coupling configurations. This work will promote the study of quantum effects and coherent manipulation in giant‐atom topological‐waveguide‐QED.",

Practical applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era rely on Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) techniques, which are able to improve the accuracy of the expectation values of quantum observables by implementing classical post‐processing analysis from an ensemble of repeated noisy quantum circuit runs. In this work, a recent QEM technique that uses Fuzzy C‐Means (FCM) clustering to specifically identify measurement error patterns is focused. For the first time, a proof‐of‐principle validation of the technique on a two‐qubit register, obtained as a subset of a real NISQ five‐qubit superconducting quantum processor based on transmon qubits is reported. It is demonstrated that the FCM‐based QEM technique allows for reasonable improvement of the expectation values of single‐ and two‐qubit gates‐based quantum circuits, without necessarily invoking state‐of‐the‐art coherence, gate, and readout fidelities.",

This entangled state in the two‐coupled cavities blocks the creation of the subsequent photons. The system is in a superposition of only the entangled state and the vacuum state.

The Rydberg‐atom graphs are configurations of neutral atoms organized into mathematical graphs, facilitated by programmable optical tweezers, and designed to exhibit many‐body ground states that correspond to the maximum independent set (MIS) of their respective graphs. Four elementary Rydberg‐atom subgraph components are developed, not only to eliminate the need of local control but also to be robust against interatomic distance errors, while serving as the building blocks sufficient for formulating generic QUBO graphs. To validate the feasibility of the approach, a series of Rydberg‐atom experiments selected to demonstrate proof‐of‐concept operations of these building blocks are conducted. These experiments illustrate how these components can be used to programmatically encode the QUBO problems to Rydberg‐atom graphs and, by measuring their many‐body ground states, how their QUBO solutions are determined subsequently.",

Thanks to many pioneers, a level where quantum effects can be exploited is reached. Numerous cutting‐edge technologies, such as quantum sensing and quantum computing, are proposed. A common trait in all technologies is the need to manipulate and read out their states; therefore, the quantum characteristics of the building blocks must adhere to strict guidelines. Magnetic Molecules (MMs) are promising candidates. They can be obtained indistinguishably, and the control over their structural and electronic properties, makes them appealing to act as quantum bits or “qubits”. MMs can be connected to other units while preserving their coherence properties, enabling the implementation of quantum gates. Furthermore, the low‐lying energy levels can be exploited as qudits, which can exist in more than 2 states simultaneously (d &gt; 2), allowing them to hold more information efficiently. The larger electronic/nuclear space in qudits can decrease the number of physical units and enhance computational efficiency, reducing error and making them promise for complex problem‐solving. In this perspective article, the physical characteristics of MMs and key achievements that position them as promising candidates for quantum technologies, are described.",

The lifetimes of these SQEs are approximately 225 ns, more than two orders of magnitude larger than what has been previously reported for defect‐trapped excitons in WSe 2 . These SQEs consist of co‐linearly polarized doublet peaks with a fine structure splitting of 0.45 meV. Second‐order correlation measurements show antibunched single‐photon emission with a g (2) (0) value of ≈0.13. Through numerical analysis and modeling, it is shown how such long‐lifetime single emitters can arise from bright and dark exciton coupling in antisite defects on the W sites. Additionally, high‐quality single‐photon emission over a wide range of lifetimes—from 2 ns to over 200 ns—is also reported, suggesting a variety of other possible defect structures present. The flexibility to generate high fidelity single‐photon emission, over a wide range of lifetimes in a single material system, has potential in many optical quantum computing applications from high‐bit‐rate single‐photon sources to quantum memory devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Integrating nanophotonics and cold atoms has drawn increasing interest in recent years due to diverse applications in quantum information science and the exploration of quantum many‐body physics. For example, dispersion‐engineered photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) permit not only stable trapping and probing of ultracold neutral atoms via interactions with guided‐mode light, but also the possibility to explore the physics of strong, photon‐mediated interactions between atoms, as well as atom‐mediated interactions between photons. While diverse theoretical opportunities involving atoms and photons in 1D and 2D nanophotonic lattices have been analyzed, a grand challenge remains the experimental integration of PCWs with ultracold atoms. Here, an advanced apparatus that overcomes several significant barriers to current experimental progress is described, with the goal of achieving strong quantum interactions of light and matter by way of single‐atom tweezer arrays strongly coupled to photons in 1D and 2D PCWs. Principal technical advances relate to efficient free‐space coupling of light to and from guided modes of PCWs, silicate bonding of silicon chips within small glass vacuum cells, and deterministic, mechanical delivery of single‐atom tweezer arrays to the near fields of photonic crystal waveguides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a growing interest in investigating new states of matter using out‐of‐equilibrium lattice spin models in two dimensions. However, a control of pairwise interactions in such systems has been elusive as due to their nonequilibrium nature they maintain nontrivial particle fluxes even at the steady state. Here it is suggested how to overcome this problem and formulate a method for engineering reconfigurable networks of nonequilibrium condensates with control of individual pairwise interactions. Representing spin by condensate phase, the effective two spin interactions are created with nonresonant pumping, are directed with dissipative channels, and are further controlled with dissipative gates. The dissipative barriers are used to block unwanted interactions between condensates. Together, spatial anisotropy of dissipation and pump profiles allow an effective control of sign and intensity of the coupling strength between any two neighbouring sites independent of the rest of the spins, which is demonstrated with a 2D square lattice of polariton condensates. Experimental realization of such fully controllable networks offers great potential for reservoir computing, modelling of the systems of coupled oscillators, simulation of the new state of matters, studying the phase transitions in large‐scale systems, and optimization.",

We compare relative expressibility and entangling capability across different number of qubits in parameterized quantum circuits. High-dimensional qudits as a platform for hybrid quantum classical algorithms is a rarity in the literature.

Spectroscopy and refractometry are performed on a sample inserted in one internal path of the MZI by scanning the other path in length, which acquires phase and amplitude information about the sample's linear response. Phase modulation and lock‐in detection are introduced to increase detection signal‐to‐noise ratio and implement a “down‐sampling” technique for scanning the interferometer delay, which reduces the sampling requirements needed to reproduce fully the temporal interference pattern. The phase‐modulation technique also allows the contributions of various quantum‐state pathways leading to the final detection outcomes to be extracted individually. Feynman diagrams frequently used in the context of molecular spectroscopy are used to describe the interferences resulting from the coherence properties of time‐frequency EPPs passing through the MZI. These results are an important step toward the implementation of a proposed method for molecular spectroscopy—quantum‐light‐enhanced 2D spectroscopy.",

Theoretically the finding of the integrability for the quantum Rabi model (QRM) has attracted tremendous attention to the study of the QRM and its extensions which are fundamental models of the light–matter interaction. With the continuing enhancements of coupling strengths, a most fascinating phenomenon of these light–matter models is that they can exhibit few‐body quantum phase transitions (QPTs), while a full understanding of these QPTs is a challenge. The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing these fundamental models in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPTs. A review of its extensive applications on the fundamental light–matter models is presented, with discussions on the phase diagrams and QPT‐related features. The universality of critical exponent of the anisotropic QRM as well as the possibility of QPTs in A 2 terms are also addressed.",

Previous methods for vector magnetometry using ensembles of NV – centers relied on a calibrated magnetic bias field or on complex detection techniques to distinguish the crystal axes.

Quantum walks are powerful kernels in quantum computing protocols and possess strong capabilities in speeding up various simulation and optimization tasks. One striking example is provided by quantum walkers evolving on unbalanced trees, which demonstrate faster hitting performances than classical random walk. However, direct experimental construction of unbalanced trees to prove quantum advantage with exponential speedup remains a great challenge due to the highly complex arrangements of the structure. This study attempts to simulate quantum algorithm by classical circuit. Inspired by the quantum algorithm, the classical circuit networks are designed and fabricated with unbalanced tree structures. It is then demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that the quantum algorithm for the fast hitting problem can be simulated in the structure. It is shown that the hitting efficiency of electric signals in the circuit networks with unbalanced tree structures is exponentially faster than the corresponding cases of classical random walks. Because classical circuit networks possess good scalability and stability, the results open up a scalable new path toward quantum speedup in complex problems.",

It is found that the consistency between the CHRW results and numerically exact generalized‐Floquet‐theory (GFT) results in the valid regime of the former while the widely used rotating‐wave approximation breaks down. It is illustrated that the resonance exhibits band structure and the Bloch–Siegert shifts induced by the counter‐rotating couplings of the bichromatic field become notable at the multiphoton resonance band. In addition, the CHRW method is found to have a great advantage of efficiency over the GFT approach particularly in the low beat‐frequency case where the latter converges very slowly. The present CHRW method provides a highly efficient way to calculate the resonance frequency incorporating the Bloch–Siegert shift and provides insights into the effects of the counter‐rotating couplings of the bichromatic field in the strong‐driving regimes.",

In this work, combining magnetization, magneto‐transport, and structure measurements under high pressure and first principles calculations, this study finds that the pressure can drive the in‐plane antiferromagnetic structure of EuCd 2 As 2 across an intermediate in‐plane FM structure then into the out‐of‐plane FM structure. This study also finds butterfly‐shaped MR and anomalous Hall effect under large pressure, which may support the pressure‐driven FM state. High‐pressure angle‐dispersive X‐ray diffraction and X‐ray absorption near‐edge spectroscopy measurements exclude structure transition and/or change of Eu 2+ valence state as sources for the magnetic phase transitions. Alternatively, apparently reduced axial ratio ( c / a ) and compressed Eu‐layer space distance should play important roles. Interestingly, the calculations unveil that the out‐of‐plane FM structure hosts only one pair of Weyl nodes around the Fermi level, suggesting that pressure can be an alternative way to realize the ideal Weyl semimetal state in EuCd 2 As 2 and will be useful for exploring exotic topological properties in such layered magnetic topological phase with strongly competing magnetic exchanges.",

A remarkable fingerprint of this type of pairing state is provided by a nontrivial superconducting phase texture in momentum space with $\\pi$-shifted domains and walls with anomalous phase winding. The pattern of the quintet pairing texture is shown to depend on the orientation of the orbital polarization and the strength of the mirror and/or rotation symmetry breaking terms. Such momentum dependent phase makes Cooper pairs with net orbital component suited to design orbitronic Josephson effects.

One simulate boosted ensembles of quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) based on both conventional qubit‐based and continuous variable architectures, attaining effective tagging efficiencies of 28.0% and 29.2%, respectively, comparable with the leading published result of 30.0% using classical machine learning algorithms. The ensemble nature of the classifier is of particular importance, doubling the effective tagging efficiency of a single QSVM, which is find to be highly prone to overfitting. These results are obtained despite the constraint of working with QSVM architectures that are classically simulable, and it finds evidence that QSVMs beyond the simulable regime may be able to realize even higher performance, when sufficiently powerful quantum hardware is developed to execute them.",

However, they have been demonstrated with photon pairs produced through spontaneous parametric down‐conversion (SPDC) at a low parametric gain, where the average number of photons per mode is much smaller than one.

    "abstract": "Abstract Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is gaining interest as a wide bandgap van der Waals host of optically active spin defects for quantum technologies. Most studies of the spin‐photon interface in hBN focus on the negatively charged boron vacancy (V B − ) defect, which is typically fabricated by ion irradiation. However, the applicability and wide deployment of V B − defects is limited by V B − fabrication methods which lack robustness and reproducibility, particularly when applied to thin flakes (≲10 nm) of hBN. Here, two key factors are elucidated that underpin the formation and quenching of V B − centers by ion irradiation—density of defects generated in the hBN lattice and recoil‐implantation of foreign atoms into hBN. Critically, it is shown that the latter is extremely efficient at inhibiting the generation of optically‐active V B − centers. This is significant because foreign atoms such as carbon are commonplace on both the top and bottom surfaces of hBN during ion irradiation, in the form of hydrocarbon contaminants, polymer residues from hBN transfer methods, protective capping layers and substrates. Recoil implantation must be accounted for when selecting ion beam parameters such as ion mass, energy, fluence, incidence angle, and sputter/span yield, which are discussed in the context of a framework for V B − generation by high‐resolution focused ion beam (FIB) systems.",

A modified master equation is proposed, which contains a nonlinear term giving rise to both spontaneous disentanglement and thermalization. It is found that the added nonlinear term enables limit cycle steady states, which are prohibited in standard quantum mechanics. This finding suggests that an experimental observation of such a limit cycle steady state can provide an important evidence supporting the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis.",

Finally, deliberating on approaches to achieve intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity, encompassing low dimensionality, low phonon group velocities, and substantial anharmonicity.

Some inherent issues, such as charge/spin noise in materials hinder certain platforms, while increased decoherence upon attempts to scale up severely impacts qubit quality and coupling on others. In addition, a universal solution for coherent information transfer between quantum systems remains lacking. By combining one or more qubit platforms, one could potentially create new hybrid platforms that might alleviate significant issues that current single‐platform qubits suffer from, and in some cases, even facilitate the conversion of static to flying qubits on the same hybrid platform. While nascent, this is an area of rising importance that could shed new light on robust and scalable qubit development and provide new impetus for research directions. Here, the requirements for hybrid systems are defined with artificial atoms in the solid state, exemplified with systems that are proposed or attempted, and conclude with the outlook for such hybrid quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) battery models have been studied with importance because these experimentally realizable batteries have high ergotropy and capacity to store more than one quanta of energy. However, the following fundamental questions are not yet answered: Do these models have any benefit? Are these models stable against the environment? These questions are answered both numerically and analytically by considering a model that allows a laser to shine on a QHO charger, which interacts with a QHO battery. The laser frequency is tuned with the local frequencies of the charger and battery (off‐resonance) or the frequency of the global charger‐battery system (on‐resonance). It is shown that for a fixed laser field amplitude, in the off‐resonance (on‐resonance) charging process, the maximum energy stored in a battery depends on the detuning and coupling strength (charger dissipation constant). The charging process of the open QHO, which is a simplified model, is also discussed. Further, the charging process of QHO in the simplified model is observed to be faster than the same for the catalytic and non‐catalytic batteries. The self‐discharging process is found to be almost doubly faster than the charging process, implying that the QHO batteries are unstable against the environment.",

To increase the fluorescence collection efficiency, the laser beam is irradiated from the side surface of the CVD diamond, and fluorescence is detected using a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens. The floor noise level of the magnetic field signal is 44 pT/Hz 0.5 . An Allan deviation of 1.2 pT over 1000 s of averaging demonstrates stability. This is attributable to the integration of a balancing circuit to cancel out laser noise, alongside mechanisms to compensate for temperature fluctuations and a copper housing to shield against electromagnetic field noise.",

This work presents the doubled‐density operator as a comprehensive framework for studying quantum processes in space‐time. It effectively captures all the physical information of the process, with the measurement and Born rule showing uniformity for both spatial and temporal cases. It is demonstrated that the equal‐time density operator can be derived by performing a partial trace operation on the doubled‐density operator.

By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, the conditions are explored under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is calculated and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. The theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise‐induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum‐enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high‐precision measurements through quantum entanglement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum architecture search (QAS) has attracted increasing attention owing to its remarkable ability to automate the design of quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, evaluating the performance of numerous quantum circuits is essential to provide feedback for the search strategy, which inevitably renders QAS computationally expensive. Performance predictors have emerged as highly efficient evaluation methods to mitigate this challenge. However, the performance predictor faces a critical challenge in reducing the required number of circuit‐performance pairs for training. This study encodes circuit architecture by representing a quantum circuit as a relational graph that emphasizes message exchange. Subsequently, valuable information about circuit architecture is extracted through three types of graph measures, including distance‐based, degree‐based, and cluster‐based measures. The graph measures define a smooth space related to circuit performance, facilitating the training of the performance predictor. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed across three tasks within variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE): identifying the ground states of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM), the Heisenberg model, and the molecule. The simulation results demonstrate notable enhancements in predictive accuracy achieved by our method, coupled with a substantial reduction in the required number of training samples for the predictor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The unit commitment problem (UCP) is a non‐convex mixed‐integer programming issue that is crucial in the power system. The quantum alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) decompose the UCP into quadratic binary optimization (QBO) subproblems and continuous optimization subproblems. Relaxing constraints reformulate the QBO into a quadratic unconstrainted binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be addressed using quantum algorithms. Nevertheless, this approach lacks precision for hard constraints and requires more qubits, limiting the UCP scale addressed within QADMM. To confront the aforementioned challenges, this study introduces the consensus constraint‐encoded divide‐and‐conquer QADMM (CCDC‐QADMM). As a scalable fully distributed algorithm, CCDC‐QADMM decomposes the UCP into two subproblems: Subproblem 1, a QUBO problem embedded with minimum up/down constraints, and Subproblem 2, a UC problem without minimum up/down constraints. By employing variable duplication for decoupling and leveraging the principles of average consensus, CCDC‐QADMM achieves fully distributed computation. Specifically, in the QUBO subproblem 1, this algorithm encodes minimum up/down constraints into a hard constraint form within the mixing Hamiltonian. Simultaneously, it employs a divide‐and‐conquer strategy to accommodate the current constraints posed by the limited qubit resources. The effectiveness and scalability of this algorithm are substantiated through practical validation within real‐world UCP scenarios.",

There is now a large body of literature on quantum walks theoretically analyzing the quantum version of this effect, but to date, there have been no experimental observations of quantum Parrondo walks. Here, the first experimental verification of a quantum Parrondo walk within a quantum optics scenario is demonstrated. Based on the compact large‐scale experimental quantum‐walk platform, two rotation operators are implemented to realize the quantum Parrondo effect. The effect of quantum coherence in a quantum Parrondo walk is also investigated based on a delayed‐choice scheme that cannot be realized with classical light. It is demonstrated that the Parrondo effect vanishes when the quantum walk has a completely decoherent initial state in a delayed‐choice setting. Quantum walks are fundamental to multiple quantum algorithms, and this research provides motivation to expand the results to further explore quantum Parrondo walks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum effects are known to provide an advantage in particle transfer across networks. In order to achieve this advantage, requirements on both a graph type and a quantum system coherence must be found. Here, it is shown that the process of finding these requirements can be automated by learning from simulated examples. The automation is done by using a convolutional neural network of a particular type that learns to understand with which network and under which coherence requirements quantum advantage is possible. The machine learning approach is applied to study noisy quantum walks on cycle graphs of different sizes. It is found that it is possible to predict the existence of quantum advantage for the entire decoherence parameter range, even for graphs outside of the training set. The results are of importance for demonstration of advantage in quantum experiments and pave the way toward automating scientific research and discoveries.",

For instance, they can act as emitters in close-to-ideal quantum light sources. Coupled quantum dot systems with significantly increased functionality are potentially of even stronger interest since they can be used to host ultra-stable singlet-triplet spin qubits for efficient spin-photon interfaces and for a deterministic photonic 2D cluster-state generation. We realize an advanced quantum dot molecule (QDM) device and demonstrate excellent optical properties. The device includes electrically controllable QDMs based on stacked quantum dots in a pin-diode structure. The QDMs are deterministically integrated into a photonic structure with a circular Bragg grating using in-situ electron beam lithography. We measure a photon extraction efficiency of up to (24$\\pm$4)% in good agreement with numerical simulations. The coupling character of the QDMs is clearly demonstrated by bias voltage dependent spectroscopy that also controls the orbital couplings of the QDMs and their charge state in quantitative agreement with theory. The QDM devices show excellent single-photon emission properties with a multi-photon suppression of $g^{(2)}(0) = (3.9 \\pm 0.5) \\cdot 10^{-3}$. These metrics make the developed QDM devices attractive building blocks for use in future photonic quantum networks using advanced nanophotonic hardware.",

It is therefore natural to ask if there exists any intrinsic relationship between entanglement and coherence. In this work, the authors originally put forward tradeoff relations between intrinsic concurrence and first‐order coherence in the context of an arbitrary three‐qubit state. To do so, an equality relation related to the quantum entanglement and first‐order coherence for arbitrary three‐qubit pure states is derived first, and then extended to present another tradeoff relation regarding arbitrary three‐qubit states. Notably, physical explanation is offered for how coherence migrates in three‐qubit systems from first‐order coherence of a given subsystem to quantum correlations between subsystems. The result shows that the derived tradeoff relations can reveal the complementarity between intrinsic concurrence and first‐order coherence, which provides reliable theoretical basis of transformation and flow for quantum resources.",

The pseudogap state in the underdoped region is a distinct thermodynamic phase characterized by nematicity, temperature‐quadratic resistive behavior, and magnetoelectric effects. Till present, a general description of the observed universal features of the pseudogap phase and their connection with HTS is lacking. The proposed work constructs a unifying effective field theory capturing all universal characteristics of HTS materials and explaining the observed phase diagram. The pseudogap state is established to be a phase where a charged magnetic monopole condensate confines Cooper pairs to form an oblique version of a superinsulator. The HTS phase diagram is dominated by a tricritical point at which the first order transition between a fundamental Cooper pair condensate and a charged magnetic monopole condensate merges with the continuous superconductor‐normal metal and superconductor‐pseudogap state phase transitions. The universality of the HTS phase diagram reflects a unique topological mechanism of competition between the magnetic monopole condensate, inherent to antiferromagnetic‐order‐induced Mott insulators and the Cooper pair condensate. The obtained results establish the topological nature of the HTS and provide a platform for devising materials with the enhanced superconducting transition temperature.",

The present implementation includes several levels of optimization, such as circuit identities and error mitigation, and allows us to cross the classical threshold and demonstrate quantum advantage in one quantum computer. The quantum nature of the cluster state is further studied by a Bell inequality that allows us to observe quantum advantage in less accurate quantum computers, at the expense of probing a larger number of circuits.",

We find the QPT is accompanied with a hidden symmetry breaking, whereas the emerging series transitions are topological transitions without symmetry breaking. The topological structure of the wave function provides a novel universality classification in bridging the QRM and the JCM.

An effective technique for the generation of a rectangular shape higher‐order mode squeezed light with a maximum mode order of 5 is experimentally demonstrated using a doubling resonated optical parametric amplifier. Furthermore, the fourth order tilt‐ and displacement‐squeezed beams are constructed and used to perform spatial tilt and displacement measurements, thereby improving the signal‐to‐noise ratio by 10 and 8.6 dB compared to the mode. The results indicate that high‐order spatially squeezed states enhance measurement precision beyond the shot noise limit and are more prominent in back‐action noise reduction.

Although several types of systems have been proposed as quantum reservoirs, differences arising from particle statistics have not been established yet. In this work, the ability of bosons, fermions, and qubits are assessed and compared to store information from past inputs by measuring linear and nonlinear memory capacity. While, in general, the performance of the system improves with the Hilbert space size, it is shown that also the information spreading capability is a key factor. For the simplest reservoir Hamiltonian choice, and for each boson limited to at most one excitation, fermions provide the best reservoir due to their intrinsic nonlocal properties. On the other hand, a tailored input injection strategy allows the exploitation of the abundance of degrees of freedom of the Hilbert space for bosonic quantum reservoir computing and enhances the computational power compared to both qubits and fermions.",

In compatibility with the state‐of‐the‐art classical bit technology, it is shown that the single gate of a nanowire FET can be replaced by two localized gates to achieve such charge‐qubit operation. On application of relevant biases to the localized gates, two voltage tunable quantum dots are created within the nanowire channel with electrostatically controlled single‐state‐occupancy and interdot coupling leading to charge‐qubit operation at room temperature. The associated electron transport is theoretically modeled on the basis of nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. The “initialization” and “manipulation” for qubit operation are performed by applying suitable gate voltages, whereas the “measurement” is executed by applying a small drain bias to obtain a pulse current of ≈pA order. A ≈25 MHz frequency of coherent oscillation is observed for the qubit and a characteristic decay time of ≈ 70 ns is achieved. The results suggest that such dual gate nanowire FET is a promising architecture for charge‐qubit operation at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Currently, the primary applications of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) are in the area of biosensing, by using photoluminescence or spin properties of color centres, mainly represented by the nitrogen vacancy (NV) point defect. The sensitivity of NV‐FNDs to external fields is, however, limited by crystallographic defects, which influence their key quantum state characteristics ‐ the spin longitudinal ( T 1 ) and spin transversal ( T 2 ) relaxation and coherence times, respectively. This paper reports on utilizing an advanced FND growth technique consisting of heterogeneous nucleation on pre‐engineered sites to create FNDs averaging around 60 nm in size, with mean longitudinal coherence times of 800 s and a maximum over 1.8 ms, close to bulk theoretical values. This is a major, nearly ten‐fold improvement over commercially available nanodiamonds for the same size range of 50 to 150 nm. Heavy‐N doped nanodiamond shells, important for sensing events in nm proximity to the diamond surface, are fabricated and discussed in terms of re‐nucleation and twinning on {111} crystal facets. The scalability issues are discussed in order to enable the production of FND volumes matching the needs of sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In classical machine learning (ML), “overfitting” is the phenomenon occurring when a given model learns the training data excessively well, and it thus performs poorly on unseen data. A commonly employed technique in ML is the so called “dropout,” which prevents computational units from becoming too specialized, hence reducing the risk of overfitting. With the advent of quantum neural networks (QNNs) as learning models, overfitting might soon become an issue, owing to the increasing depth of quantum circuits as well as multiple embedding of classical features, which are employed to give the computational nonlinearity. Here, a generalized approach is presented to apply the dropout technique in QNN models, defining and analyzing different quantum dropout strategies to avoid overfitting and achieve a high level of generalization. This study allows to envision the power of quantum dropout in enabling generalization, providing useful guidelines on determining the maximal dropout probability for a given model, based on overparametrization theory. It also highlights how quantum dropout does not impact the features of the QNN models, such as expressibility and entanglement. All these conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations and may pave the way to efficiently employing deep quantum machine learning (QML) models based on state‐of‐the‐art QNNs.",

However, dissipation and noise arising from the coupling with the environment are commonly perceived as major obstacles to its practical exploitation, as they impact the coherence and performance of the utilized quantum devices. Significant efforts have been dedicated to mitigating and controlling their negative effects on these devices. This perspective takes a different approach, aiming to harness the potential of noise and dissipation instead of combating them. Surprisingly, it is shown that these seemingly detrimental factors can provide substantial advantages in the operation of QML algorithms under certain circumstances. Exploring and understanding the implications of adapting QML algorithms to open quantum systems opens up pathways for devising strategies that effectively leverage noise and dissipation. The recent works analyzed in this perspective represent only initial steps toward uncovering other potential hidden benefits that dissipation and noise may offer. As exploration in this field continues, significant discoveries are anticipated that could reshape the future of quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herein, a theoretical and experimental electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (EELS) study on gold nanosphere dimers is presented, with interparticle distance d of the dimers varying from 10 nm to a few angstroms. Injecting an electron beam at the edge or the gap of the dimers excites their longitudinal bonding dipolar mode (BDM) or antibonding dipolar mode (ADM), respectively. Together with comprehensive EELS calculations within the frameworks of a classical local model, a hydrodynamic nonlocal model, and a quantum‐corrected model (QCM), it is revealed that spatial nonlocality and electron tunneling have distinctively different effects on the plasmonic properties of BDM and ADM, such as resonant energy and intensity variation. Specifically, the spatial nonlocality effect blue‐shifts the BDM energy and decreases its EELS intensity at d &lt; 3 nm compared to the classical local results, while the electron tunneling effect induces a much weaker charge transfer mode (CTM) at d &lt; 0.3 nm. However, both effects have little impact on the ADM energy though they indeed affect its EELS intensity in dramatically different manners. The experimental EELS spectra measured at varied gap size are qualitatively consistent with the numerical calculations. These results may contribute to further understanding of quantum mechanical effects in different kinds of hybridized plasmon modes in strongly coupled metallic nanostructures.",

In light of this method, a family of conditional majorization uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory is constructed, which is applicable to arbitrary number of observables. The new family of uncertainty relations implies sophisticated structures of quantum uncertainty and non‐locality, that are usually studied by using scalar measures.

Experiments in the field are therefore impeded by the efforts involved in achieving high polarization of the sample which is a challenging endeavor.

Here, new insight for the precise control of half‐skyrmion motion is presented, including complete suppression of the SkHE by deforming the internal structure of skyrmions, which is experimentally achieved by external magnetic field to steer current‐driven half‐skyrmions in the desired direction. Furthermore, based on the unique advantages in half‐skyrmions, the potential of half‐skyrmions application beyond skyrmion‐based electronics is also demonstrated by presenting simple half‐skyrmion‐based addition/subtraction operation. The findings of controllability of 2D half‐skyrmion motion will provide new perspectives on utilization of topological solitons for device applications.",

Here, a scheme is proposed to realize nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates with short paths based on simple pulse control techniques, instead of deliberated pulse control in previous investigations, which can thus further suppress the influence from the environment induced noises. Specifically, the idea is illustrated on a superconducting quantum circuit, which is one of the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computer. As the current scheme shortens the geometric evolution path, ultra‐high gate fidelity can be obtained, especially for the two‐qubit gate case, as verified by the numerical simulation. Therefore, the protocol suggests a promising way toward high‐fidelity and robust quantum computation on a solid‐state quantum system.",

Based on two mechanical oscillators with identical or different frequencies, a specific kind of amplitude‐modulated pump field is respectively designed, which successfully manipulates the mechanical oscillators into the highly entangled two‐mode squeezed state. The maximum value of the logarithmic negativity that quantifies the generated entanglement reaches about 9 ebits in the appropriate parameter regime, which greatly surpasses the bound 1 ebits on the maximal stationary entanglement from the two‐mode parametric interaction. Moreover, the obtained entanglement can be detected via resorting to an ancillary cavity mode with homodyne detection technique.

In this study, a magneto‐topological phase transition (magneto‐TPT), that is, the phenomenon of magnetic materials undergoing different magnetic and topological phases during pressure loading, is investigated. By considering both out‐of‐plane ferromagnetic and in‐plane antiferromagnetic components, it is discovered that the calculated results fit well with the experimental data. The calculation results further reveal a pristine Weyl phase with four additional pairs of Weyl nodes under low pressure, and a generally defined Z 2 topological insulator phase after the restoration of time‐reversal symmetry at 40.4 GPa. The transport measurements performed at 5 K reveal that the magnetic order almost vanishes at 40.3 GPa, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. Moreover, the present magneto‐TPT involves the degeneration of a pair of crossing bands of two spin channels. Hence, all the chiral Weyl nodes annihilate with their counterparts from another spin channel, in contrast to the typical intraband annihilation of Weyl pairs in inversion‐asymmetric systems. The study reveals a method for realizing diverse topological states by modulating exchange splitting by external physical knobs such as pressure in topological magnets.",

Scaling relation is a typical universality for critical phenomena around a quantum phase transition, while topological classification provides another type of universality essentially different from the critical universality. Both classes of universalities can be present in a single‐qubit system with light‐matter interactions, as exhibiting generally in the fundamental quantum Rabi model with anisotropy not only for linear coupling but also for nonlinear Stark coupling (NSC). In low frequencies different levels of scaling relations are extracted, holding for anisotropic or/and NSCs, locally or globally. At finite frequencies such a critical universality breaks down and diversity is dominant. However, common topological feature of the ground state can be extracted from the node number, which yields a topological class of universality amidst the critical diversity. Both conventional and unconventional topological transitions emerge, with their meeting, which never occurs in linear interaction, enabled by the nonlinear coupling to form topological quadruple points which are found to be spin‐invariant points. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the NSC can be another applicable approach to manipulate topological transitions in addition to coupling anisotropy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acquiring information at the fastest possible rate is often desirable, particularly in quantum ghost imaging which suffers from slow reconstruction speeds. Many computationally intense deep‐learning methods have been implemented in an effort to speed up image acquisition times by retrieving image information. Often over‐looked, machine learning methods can offer the same, if not better, speed up in image acquisition time by an object recognition process. Four machine learning algorithms are implemented and trained on a uniquely generated, noised, and blurred dataset of numerical digits 1 through 9. Of the tested recognition algorithms, logistic regression shows a 10× speed up in image acquisition time with a 99% prediction accuracy. Additionally, this reduction in acquisition time is achieved without any image denoising or enhancement prior to recognition, thereby reducing training and implementation time, as well as the computational intensity of the approach. This method can be implemented in real‐time, requiring only 1/10 th of the measurements needed for a general solution, making it ideal for quantum imaging and recognition of light sensitive structure.",

Among the various nonlinear interactions capable of generating squeezing, the optical Kerr effect is particularly easy-to-use. A popular venue is to generate polarization squeezing, which is a special self-referencing variant of two-mode squeezing. To date, polarization squeezing generation setups have been very sensitive to fluctuations of external factors and have required careful tuning. In this work, we report on a development of a new all-fibre setup for polarization squeezing generation. The setup consists of passive elements only and is simple, robust, and stable. We obtained more than 5 dB of directly measured squeezing over long periods of time without any need for adjustments. Thus, the new scheme provides a robust and easy to set up way of obtaining squeezed light applicable to different applications. We investigate the impact of pulse duration and pulse power on the degree of squeezing.",

A unifying framework enabling to compare the various entanglement distribution, purification, and routing protocols published so far is presented. With regard to entanglement routing, the introduction of different time windows will be essential in order to cope efficiently with the main challenges like complex route calculation and fidelity estimation on the one hand, actual entanglement route selection and entangled photon generation on the other hand. For a roll‐out on top of existing transmission networks, all the research publications for the last 20 years start to cover pretty well the global scheme. Nevertheless, open questions remain, like the actual advantage of some task execution prior to the online quantum path selection, or the design of algorithms approximating the multi‐commodities flow optimization problem, or the issue of dealing with a processing time not much longer than the qubit life time.",

However, T 2 * of the NV centers is significantly reduced by the stress distribution in the diamond film as its thickness increases. To overcome this issue, they developed a method to mitigate the stress distribution in the CVD diamond films, leading to a T 2 * extension of the ensemble NV centers. CVD diamond films of ≈60 µm thickness with perfectly aligned NV centers are formed on (111) diamond substrates with misorientation angles of 2.0°, 3.7°, 5.0°, and 10.0°. The study found that T 2 * of the ensemble of NV centers increased to approach its value limited only by the electron and nuclear spin bath with increasing the misorientation angle. Microscopic stress imaging revealed that the stress distribution is highly inhomogeneous along the depth direction in the CVD diamond film at low misorientation angles, whereas the inhomogeneity is largely suppressed on highly misoriented substrates. The reduced stress distribution possibly originates from the reduction of the dislocation density in the CVD diamond. This study provides an important method for synthesizing high‐quality diamond materials for use in highly sensitive quantum sensors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The discovery of skyrmions has recently sparked tremendous interest in topologically nontrivial spin textures. The signature of the noncoplanar nature of magnetic moments can be observed as topological Hall effect (THE) in electrical measurement. Realization of such nontrivial spin textures in new materials and through new routes is an ongoing endeavor due to their huge potential for future ultra‐dense, low‐power memory applications. In this work, oxygen vacancy (OV)‐induced THE and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a 5 d 0 system KTaO 3 are reported. The observation of weak antilocalization behavior and THE in the same temperature range strongly implies the crucial role of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) behind the origin of THE. Ab initio calculations reveal the formation of the magnetic moment on Ta atoms around the OV and Rashba‐type spin texturing of conduction electrons. In the presence of Rashba SOC, the local moments around vacancy can form bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) with noncollinear spin texture, resulting in THE. Scaling analysis between transverse and longitudinal resistance establishes skew scattering‐driven AHE in the present case. This study opens a route to realize topological phenomena through defect engineering.",

Multisusceptible BaFe 12 O 19 is noteworthy for its excellent magnetic, dielectric properties and thus the application in high‐density information storage, while its collinear spin structure limits the emergence of ferroelectrics and ME coupling. In this work, nonzero Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction is created by partial substitution of the spin‐down Fe 3+ sites to induce conical spin structure in BaFe 12 O 19 . Larger In 3+ ions are introduced and prefer to occupy the spin‐down 4 f 1 and 4 f 2 lattice sites. The evolution of magnetization versus temperature adduces evidence of conical magnetic structure. As a result, direct ME and magnetodielectric coupling are obtained in In‐doped BaFe 12 O 19 ceramics. An interlayer DM interaction model is built to discuss the intrinsic relationship among crystal structure, noncollinear magnetic structure, and ionic substitution. Moreover, BaZn 0.9 Zr 0.9 Fe 10.2 O 19 ceramics are also prepared, and exhibit noncollinear magnetic structure and direct ME coupling since Zn 2+ and Zr 4+ also possess larger radii than Fe 3+ and prefer to enter the spin‐down sites.

Here, a basis‐independent approach to the pump shaping problem that crafts the problem in terms of an invertible tensor equation is presented, making it possible to determine the requisite pump profile for any desired downconversion joint probability spectrum, often analytically. It is first shown that this approach reproduces a number of prior results exactly and then go on to demonstrate results not possible with existing techniques, such as shaping quantum states in new bases and controlling the signal‐to‐noise ratio. It is believed that this approach is optimal as the solvable tensor equation can be tailored to focus on any desired state (sub)space and can be optimized with respect to a chosen norm.

When thinned down to a few nanometers, the hybridization between the topological surface states at the top and bottom surfaces results in a topological quantum phase transition, which can lead to the emergence of a quantum spin Hall phase. Here, the thickness‐dependent transport properties across the quantum phase transition are studied on the example of (Bi 0.16 Sb 0.84 .) 2 Te 3 films, with a four‐tip scanning tunneling microscope. The findings reveal an exponential drop of the conductivity below the critical thickness. The steepness of this drop indicates the presence of spin‐conserving backscattering between the top and bottom surface states, effectively lifting the spin‐momentum locking and resulting in the opening of a gap at the Dirac point. The experiments provide a crucial step toward the detection of quantum spin Hall states in transport measurements.",

Different approaches to isolation and nonreciprocity in quantum systems are reviewed, with a focus on a specific class of passive devices where nonreciprocity is induced by the system nonlinearity, without the need of an external bias. It is then discussed how to model these effects and what their underlying physics is, outlining how the existence of a slowly‐decaying subradiant state is critical to obtain large nonreciprocal responses.

However, the characterization of multipartite entanglement structure remains a formidable challenge, as traditionally it requires exponential number of local measurements to realize the identification. Machine learning is demonstrated to be an efficient tool to detect the underlying entanglement structure for ideal states, but it has non‐negligible underperformance when tackling imperfect experimental data in reality. Here, a modified classifier based on feed‐forward neural network to predict experimental entanglement structure in terms of entanglement intactness and depth is proposed. By preprocessing the input data, the classifier maintains efficiency and reliability against experimental noises, with the accuracy being enhanced from 69.7% to 91.2% for 6‐qubit entangled states in spin systems. This method is anticipated to shed light on future studies of entanglement structure, in particular when the number of controlled qubits reaches explosive growth in practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The idea of periodic pulse engineering (PPE) is exploited to achieve unconventional Rydberg pumping for a robust multiqubit gate on Rydberg atoms trapped in a 2D array. By designing component parameters in PPE, fast regimes of full and partial Rydberg antiblockade (RAB) among three atoms are explored. Furthermore, through assigning appropriate components in PPE a phenomenon of RAB‐based blockade emerges and then a three‐qubit gate can be achieved. It is identified that two kinds of Rydberg–Rydberg interaction (RRI), van der Waals interaction and dipole–dipole Förster resonance interaction, are both applicative for implementing the proposed scheme. Different from recent schemes of Rydberg atom multiqubit gates, the operated atoms are indistinguishable with respect to the laser field of PPE, and the present one‐step scheme is essentially fast owing to the first‐order dynamics where the dominant component in PPE is not degraded. In addition, the proposed multiqubit gate is robust against atomic decay and deviation of RRI strengths, because the excitation duration of atoms is short, with the total excitation number ⩽1. This work may facilitate experimental demonstration of RAB‐based gates of strongly coupled atoms.",

    "abstract": "We address the quantum search of a target node on a cycle graph by means of a quantum walk assisted by continuous measurement and feedback. Unlike previous spatial search approaches, where the oracle is described as a projector on the target state, we instead consider a dynamical oracle implemented through a feedback Hamiltonian. In particular, our protocol is able to drive the walker to a desired target node. The idea is based on continuously monitoring the position of the quantum walker on the graph and then to apply a unitary feedback operation based on the information obtained from measurement. The feedback changes the couplings between the nodes and it is optimized at each time via a numerical procedure. We numerically simulate the stochastic trajectories describing the evolution for graphs of dimensions up to $N=15$, and quantify the performance of the protocol via the average fidelity between the state of the walker and the target node. We discuss different constraints on the control strategy, in particular on the possible values that the feedback couplings can take. We find that for unbounded controls, the protocol is able to quickly localize the walker on the target node. We then discuss how the performance is lowered by posing an upper bound on the control couplings, but still allowing to stabilize the walker in the desired node. Finally, we show how a digital feedback protocol, where the couplings can take values only from a discrete set, seems in general as efficient as the continuous bounded one.",

In this paper, recent experimental and theoretical progress in the design, preparation, characterization, and physical property measurement of LaNiO 3 ‐based heterostructure composites and the infinite‐layer Ni 1 + nickelate superconducting thin films on (001) SrTiO 3 substrate is reviewed, mainly by the methods of various X‐ray spectroscopy measurements, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and magneto‐transport measurements. In these materials, the electronic structure and orbital occupation around the Fermi level are modified, enabling nickelate‐based composite materials to exhibit new states of matter and physical phenomena, which are absent in the bulk constituents. Their confined structures, superconductivity, orbital polarization, charge transfer, electronic structures, magnetic properties, and X‐ray spectroscopic analysis, are therefore highlighted, aiming at understanding unconventional superconducting mechanisms and designing new high‐ T c superconducting low‐dimensional materials for device applications.",

An image encryption scheme is proposed benefiting from chaotic random behavior characteristics of Boson sampling (BS) probability distribution, where the chaotic random number sequence is used to implement the encryption process including scrambling image pixels and altering the values of pixels. Further, a BS‐based image encryption prototype system is constructed on the programmable silicon photonic processor chip for BS with 5‐mode 2‐photon, which can encrypt 4 × 4 grayscale images. Besides, experiments for encrypting 256 × 256 gray‐scale images with 20‐mode 8‐photon BS are simulated on the StrawberryFields photonic quantum software platform. Numerical analyses demonstrate the proposed scheme has good effectiveness in terms of randomness test, information entropy, histogram, correlation, key space, key sensitivity, and anti‐attack, offering gains in many cryptographic applications.

To reduce the accumulation of imprecision and decoherence resulting from the combination of multiple elementary gates, the optimal pulses that can achieve the two‐qubit Hadamard gate and diffusion operation in one step are designed successfully. In this way, the probabilities to find the states corresponding to the desired elements in an unsorted database are enhanced to some extent. Moreover, the optimal pulse sequence suitable for a four‐level molecular qudit, which can be used to simulate the quantum search on a single CH 3 CN molecule with high fidelity, is designed. These results can shed some light on the physical realization of quantum computing based on ultracold polyatomic molecules.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ballistic conduction through narrow constrictions connecting charge reservoirs exhibits conductance quantization effects. Since the quantum of conductance is only related to fundamental constants of nature, these effects might allow the implementation of a standard of resistance, fulfilling the requirements of the 2019 revised International System of Units. Moreover, this standard would be able to work at room temperature and without a magnetic field, thus allowing its on‐chip implementation. In this work, the authors propose that breakdown filaments in thin oxide layers might be useful to this purpose. In particular, conductance quantization effects in nanolaminate Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 dielectrics are reported and the role of intrinsic values of conductance and extrinsic parasitic elements are analyzed. The fact that breakdown filaments are irreversible is an advantage due to their expected stability and to the lack of cycle‐to‐cycle variations (as compared to resistive switching devices). Although the reported sample‐to‐sample variations are still too large for a real application, there is room for improving the controlover breakdown filaments through material design and electroforming conditions. Provided that this control is achieved, an on‐chip implementation of a resistance standard for the realization of self‐calibrating electrical systems and equipment with zero‐chain traceability would be possible.",

The subsequent interference effects generated at a beam splitter result in a mixture of maximally entangled Bell states and NOON states. We also discuss how every maximally entangled state of two fermionic qubits distributed over two spatial modes can be obtained from one another by fermionic passive optical transformations. Using a pseudospin-insensitive, non-absorbing, parity check detector, the proposed technique is thus shown to deterministically prepare any arbitrary maximally entangled state of two identical fermions. These results extend recent findings related to bosonic qubits. Finally, we analyze the performance of the protocol for both bosons and fermions when the externally activated noisy channels are not used and the two qubits undergo standard types of noise. The results supply further insights towards viable strategies for noise-protected entanglement exploitable in quantum-enhanced technologies.",

Second/third‐order splitting results from the coexistence of crystal field and non‐Hermitian spectral Autler Townes (SAT)‐splitting caused by single‐photon dressing coupled with the interaction of phonon and double photon–phonon dressing. It is further explored the relationship between spectral and temporal‐domain splitting obtained through the different phases of Eu 3+ : BiPO 4 by changing the laser detuning. It is authenticated that the contributions of crystal field, photon, and phonon dressing interactions can only be individually distinguished in the spectral domain.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, quantum computing is considered as a promising future computing paradigm. However, when implementing quantum circuits on a quantum device, it is necessary to ensure that quantum circuits satisfy nearest‐neighbor architecture constraints. When performing nearest‐neighbor architecture mapping for quantum circuits, it is inevitable to introduce SWAP gates, which will increase the overhead and reduce the fidelity. Therefore, it is crucial to complete the mapping with the minimum SWAP. In this paper, a 2D nearest‐neighbor architecture mapping method for quantum circuits is proposed based on deep reinforcement learning. In the initial mapping, an isomorphic graph initial mapping search algorithm is designed to quickly find the isomorphic graph between quantum circuit and architecture constraint graph. For quantum circuits without isomorphic graph mapping, the reordering algorithm of qubit impact factors is designed to obtain the initial placement position of qubits. In the SWAP gate addition, a qubit local reordering algorithm based on dueling deep‐Q‐network is designed to reduce SWAP gates. Experiments on the benchmark set B131 and IBM Q20 Tokyo verify that the proposed method can add fewer SWAP gates. Compared with the state‐of‐the‐art method, the average running time is accelerated by 63.1%, and the average SWAP gates added are reduced by 24.7%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Entanglement in many‐body systems may display quantum phase transition signatures, and analogous insights are emerging in the study of work fluctuations. Here, the fermionic superfluid‐to‐insulator transition (SIT) is considered and related to its entanglement properties and its work distribution statistics. Using the attractive fermionic Hubbard model with randomly distributed impurities, the work distribution is analyzed under two quench protocols triggering the SIT. In the first, the concentration of impurities is increased; in the second, the impurities' disorder strength is varied. The results indicate that, at criticality, the entanglement is minimized while the average work is maximized. This study demonstrates that, for this state, density fluctuations vanish at all orders, resulting in all central moments of the work probability distribution being precisely zero. For systems undergoing a precursor to the transition (short chains with finite impurity potential) numerical results confirm these predictions, with higher moments further from the ideal results. For both protocols, at criticality, the system absorbs the most energy with almost no penalty in terms of fluctuations: ultimately this feature can be used to implement a quantum critical battery. The impact of temperature on this critical behaviour is also investigated and shown to favor work extraction for high enough temperatures.",

Typically, multidimensional spectra are interpreted via a perturbative framework that straightforwardly provides intuition into the density matrix dynamics that give rise to specific spectral features.

Here, an approach developed by Vagov et al. is extended to provide an exact expression for multidimensional spectra of a spin‐boson Hamiltonian up to arbitrary order of electric field interaction. The utility of this expression is demonstrated by modeling polaron formation and coherent exciton‐phonon coupling in quantum dots, which strongly agree with experiment.",

Nevertheless, their utility is often curtailed by quantum sensor noise, encompassing both technical and quantum‐mechanical noise. This research delves into the potential of the Kalman filter as a tool to subdue quantum sensor noise, thereby augmenting the sensitivity of single‐beam atomic magnetometers. Quantum‐mechanical noise is integrated into the system model as the process noise and measurement noise, and a discrete Kalman filter equipped with a time delay variable is employed. The findings reveal that the time delay variable significantly influences temporal signal tracing, while the discrete Kalman filter enhances sensitivity performance in frequency domain analysis, bypassing the typical sensitivity and time resolution trade‐off encountered in coherent sensing strategies. Partial‐knowledge signal scenarios are also taken into account, wherein a polynomial model is proposed to expansively render the discrete Kalman filter more relevant and adaptable to real‐world situations. Collectively, through experimentation involving sine‐like, non‐Gaussian, and medical magnetocardiography (MCG) signals, our results underscore the promising potential of the Kalman filter in enhancing the sensitivity of atomic magnetometers for practical sensing applications.",

The shifting of mode frequencies and mode splitting is witnessed depending on the vortex configurations in the lattice. The obtained gyrotropic modes are analogous to two‐dimensional square lattice structures exhibiting acoustic and optical phonon modes. The dynamics of magnetic vortices are also discussed in the transfer of magnetic energy at three points along the three high symmetry directions of the lattice when the central magnetic vortex is excited by a spin‐polarized current with an excitation frequency equal to the collective gyrotropic frequencies of the vortices. Similar to the higher contribution of acoustic phonon modes in the heat transmission process in a crystal lattice, acoustic‐like gyrotropic modes transfer more energy than optical‐like gyration modes in the vortex lattices. These magnetic metastructures hold promise for novel applications in magnetic waveguides and information processing devices, as well as for advancing spintronics.",

In this paper, a stochastic model of the SERF co‐magnetometer is proposed to analyze the mechanism of stochastic magnetic field noise. The mean and covariance propagation model of the SERF co‐magnetometer is given based on the stochasticity model and statistical principles. The analysis of simulation experiments reveals that reducing the longitudinal electron spin polarization can somewhat reduce the standard deviation of the system output caused by stochastic magnetic field noise. And the atomic ensembles are most resistant to stochastic magnetic field noise when the electron spin polarization strongly couples with the nuclear spin polarization. Finally, the experiments verified the above conclusions. In conclusion, this paper provides theoretical and experimental support for analyzing and suppressing the effect of stochastic magnetic field noise on the SERF co‐magnetometer, which is of great significance for improving the sensitivity and stability of the measurement.",

In this device, multiple quasi‐periodic current peaks are observed at low temperatures in the electrical transfer characteristics. Such behavior of the transport characteristics is generally observed in devices having high doping concentration or with selective doping in the channel region to form a multi‐donor cluster quantum dot. However, in the present device donor–cluster formation is highly improbable owing to low doping concentration. The observed electrical transport characteristics of the device are explained with a model of two non‐interacting donors coupled in series with an unintentionally larger quantum dot, likely formed within the channel due to roughness.

However, achieving photon blockade in experiments is challenging due to the small single‐photon optomechanical coupling strength. Here, photon blockade in an optomechanical system is investigated, where the cavity mode is either strongly or weakly squeezed. When the cavity mode is strongly squeezed, the coupling between squeezed mode and mechanical mode will be exponentially enhanced, leading to strong optical nonlinearity that is required for the realization of photon blockade. In contrast, when the cavity mode is weakly squeezed, the nonlinear optomechanical interaction is weak. It is shown that photon blockade can also be realized through the destructive interference of two paths for two‐photon excitation. Interestingly, it is found that a larger mechanical decay rate facilitates the implementation of the interference‐based photon blockade, and thermal noise effects can be significantly suppressed by the destructive interference.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into charging energy and exchange coupling terms. Although this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, confinement‐induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement within the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), significant behaviors are uncovered influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In QDs with Ising exchange interactions, far below the Stoner instability (SI) point, where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. These findings demonstrate that for QDs with small exchange interactions, the responses of easy‐plane () and easy‐axis () configurations are similar, with increased anisotropy broadening susceptibility and shifting its maximum to higher frequencies. For large exchange interactions, the susceptibility differences between easy‐plane and easy‐axis QDs become significant, with easy‐plane QDs exhibiting a higher susceptibility magnitude. Additionally, the study reveals that temperature variations affect the dynamic response functions differently in easy‐axis and easy‐plane QDs. In easy‐plane QDs, QFI consistently decreases with increasing temperature, whereas in easy‐axis QDs, QFI behavior is highly dependent on the strengths of and , showing either an increase or decrease with temperature based on specific coupling conditions. Conversely, at low temperatures, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Overall, this work contributes to advancing the understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Entropic dynamics of a multiqubit cavity quantum electrodynamics system is simulated and various aspects of entropy are explored. In the modified version of the Tavis–Cummings–Hubbard model, atoms are held in optical cavities through optical tweezers and can jump between different cavities through the tunneling effect. The interaction of atom with the cavity results in different electronic transitions and the creation and annihilation of corresponding types of photon. Electron spin and the Pauli exclusion principle are considered. Formation and break of covalent bond and creation and annihilation of phonon are also introduced into the model. The system is bipartite. The effect of all kinds of interactions on entropy is studied. And the von Neumann entropy of different subsystems is compared. The results show that the entropic dynamics can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters, and the entropy values of different subsystems satisfy certain inequality relationships.",

In this work, this challenge is addressed by proposing a quantum transfer learning (QTL) architecture that integrates quantum variational circuits with a classical machine learning network pre‐trained on ImageNet dataset. Through a systematic set of simulations over a variety of image datasets such as Ants &amp; Bees, CIFAR‐10, and Road Sign Detection, the superior performance of the QTL approach over classical and quantum machine learning without involving transfer learning is demonstrated. Furthermore, the adversarial robustness of QTL architecture with and without adversarial training is evaluated, confirming that our QTL method is adversarially robust against data manipulation attacks and outperforms classical methods.",

According to the experimental data, these pairs can be formed from donor‐like substitutional nitrogen present in the diamond lattice and 2D acceptor layer resulting from the effect of transfer doping on the nanodiamond surface. A peculiar behavior of the narrow lines is identified within the temperature range of 100–10 K: their energy position slightly shifts downward, and the majority of the lines divide into two or more components as the temperature decreases. The lines are shown to be predominantly associated with single photon emitters, with an emission rate exceeding 1 million counts s −1 at room temperature. A new narrowband source of room‐temperature fluorescence found in hydrogen‐terminated nanodiamonds push horizons for quantum optical technologies related to the development of single photon emitters and temperature nanosensors.",

One of the key properties for quantum computing is the ability to generate multipartite entangled states. In this study, aspects of benchmarking entanglement generation capabilities of noisy intermediate‐scale quantum (NISQ) devices are discussed based on the preparation of graph states and the verification of entanglement in the prepared states. Thereby, entanglement witnesses that are specifically suited for a scalable experiment design are used. This choice of entanglement witnesses can detect A) bipartite entanglement and B) genuine multipartite entanglement for graph states with constant two measurement settings if the prepared graph state is based on a two‐colorable graph, e.g., a square grid graph or one of its subgraphs. With this, it is experimentally verified that a bipartite entangled state comprising all qubits can be prepared on a 127‐qubit IBM Quantum superconducting QPU, and genuine multipartite entanglement can be detected for states of up to 23 qubits with quantum readout error mitigation.",

This study analyzes the performance of three efficient quantum machine learning algorithms viz., variational quantum classifier (VQC), quantum support vector classifier (QSVC), and quantum neural networks (QNN) for distinguishing transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) from transitional metal oxides (TMOs).

In this context, nanophotonic silicon devices implanted with erbium are a promising hardware platform that combines advanced wafer‐scale nanofabrication technology with coherent emission in the minimal‐loss band of optical fibers. Recent studies have reported two distinct sites in the silicon lattice in which erbium can be reproducibly integrated with particularly promising properties. Here, for an in‐depth analysis of these sites, resonant fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on a nanophotonic waveguide in magnetic fields applied along different orientations. In this way, the site symmetry is determined, the spin Hamiltonian is reconstructed and a partial fit of the crystal field Hamiltonian is performed. The obtained quantitative description of the magnetic interaction allows the optimization of Zeeman splittings, optical branching ratios or microwave driving to the needs of future experiments. Beyond that, the derived site symmetry constrains the location of the erbium dopant in the silicon unit cell. This is a key step toward a detailed microscopic understanding of the erbium sites, which may help to improve the integration yield, thus paving the way to efficient nanophotonic quantum memories based on the Er:Si platform.",

A multiqubit logic gate can efficiently reduce the cost of physical resources and complicated operations that are necessary in the combination of fewer‐qubit (e.g., two‐qubit) logic gates to fulfill the same tasks. However, the construction of multiphoton quantum logic gates is a large challenge. Assisted by spatial and temporal degrees of freedom, a polarization multiphoton controlled one‐photon unitary gate is proposed, which can be realized with three processes including the control‐path process based on weak cross‐Kerr nonlinearities, the unitary transformation process, and the output process. In the control‐path process, the control‐path modules are applied, where the entanglement between polarization, spatial and temporal degrees of freedom is generated by beam splitters, time delayers, and nonlinear interaction in cross‐Kerr media. The scheme presented here, assisted by spatial and temporal degrees of freedom reduces the experimental complexity of the schemes assisted by only spatial degree of freedom. Moreover, it will also be a useful reference in optimally constructing multiqubit quantum logic gates with other multiple degrees of freedom in many physical systems.",

They influence the dynamics via the amplitude and the phase of the feedback signal. These quantities are, however, not independent. Here, the aim is to control the feedback phase via a microwave pump field.

Specifically, it is shown how characteristic timescales of a quantum‐coherent conductor can be extracted from the distribution of waiting times between charge pulses propagating through the circuit. To illustrate the idea, Floquet scattering theory is employed to evaluate the electron waiting times for an electronic Fabry–Pérot cavity and a Mach–Zehnder interferometer.

Currently most implementations of the PEA are based on qubits, where the computational units in the quantum circuits are two-dimensional states. Performing quantum computing tasks with higher dimensional states -- qudits -- has been proposed, yet a qudit-based PEA has not been realized. Using qudits can reduce the resources needed for achieving a given precision or success probability. Compared to other quantum computing hardware, photonic systems have the advantage of being resilient to noise, but the probabilistic nature of photon-photon interaction makes it difficult to realize two-photon controlled gates that are necessary components in many quantum algorithms. In this work, we report an experimental realization of a qudit-based PEA on a photonic platform, utilizing the high dimensionality in time and frequency degrees of freedom (DoFs) in a single photon. The controlled-unitary gates can be realized in a deterministic fashion, as the control and target registers are now represented by two DoFs in a single photon. This first implementation of a qudit PEA, on any platform, successfully retrieves any arbitrary phase with one ternary digit of precision.",

Analysis of nanoscale NMR signal confirms thickness of lipid bilayer to be 6.2 nm ± 3.4 nm with proton density of 65 protons per nm 3 on top of diamond sample. The result of the correlation spectroscopy from nanoscale volume is compared with the 2D molecular diffusion model constructed by Monte Carlo simulation combined with results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. There is a change in diffusion constant from 1.5 ± 0.25 nm 2 µs −1 to 3.0 ± 0.5 nm 2 µs −1 when the temperature changes from 26.5 to 36.0 °C. The results demonstrate that the multi‐parameter detection of changes in translational diffusion and temperature is possible in label‐free measurements using nanoscale diamond magnetometry. The method paves the way for label‐free imaging of cell membranes for understanding their phase composition and dynamics.",

In scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), the edge states manifest themselves as a localized density of states. However, there is a significant research gap between the observation of edge states in nanoscale spectroscopy, and the detection of ballistic transport in edge channels which typically relies on transport experiments with microscale lithographic contacts. Here, we study few-layer films of the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x})_2$Te$_3$, for which a topological transition to a two-dimensional topological QSH insulator phase has been proposed. Indeed, an edge state in the local density of states is observed within the band gap. Yet, in nanoscale transport experiments with a four-tip STM, 2 and 3 quintuple layer films do not exhibit a ballistic conductance in the edge channels. This demonstrates that the detection of edge states in spectroscopy can be misleading with regard to the identification of a QSH phase. In contrast, nanoscale multi-tip transport experiments are a robust method for effectively pinpointing ballistic edge channels, as opposed to trivial edge states, in quantum materials.",

Here, the EIT and TCPS with cesium Rydberg atoms are investigated using a ladder‐type level system driven by the 509‐nm coupling beam and the 852‐nm probe beam. The 509‐nm coupling beam with three kinds of intensity spatial profile (Laguerre–Gaussian mode, Gaussian mode, Flat‐top mode) is employed one by one in experiments. Due to the different intensity spatial distributions of the three 509‐nm coupling beams, the Autler–Townes (A–T) splitting method is utilized to calibrate the Rabi frequency of the coupling beams. These results show that the linewidth is narrowest when the 509‐nm coupling beam has the Laguerre–Gaussian mode with an equal Rabi frequency among the three cases, the linewidth and contrast of the EIT and TCPS are optimized by varying the beam sizes of the 509‐nm Laguerre–Gaussian beams. The laser frequency stabilization by using of TCPS with three kinds of 509‐nm coupling beams are compared, the Laguerre–Gaussian coupling beam case is more effective for frequency stabilization because of the narrower linewidth.",

In this work, we propose well-defined measures of imaginarity using various distance metrics, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in quantum entanglement and coherence. Specifically, we focus on quantitatively evaluating imaginarity through measures such as Tsallis relative $\\alpha$-entropy, Sandwiched R\\'{e}nyi relative entropy, and Tsallis relative operator entropy. Additionally, we analyze the decay rates of these measures. Our findings reveal that the Tsallis relative $\\alpha$-entropy of imaginarity exhibits higher decay rate under quantum channels compared to other measures. Finally, we examine the ordering of single-qubit states under these imaginarity measures, demonstrating that the order remains invariant under the bit-flip channel for specific parameter ranges. This study enhances our understanding of imaginarity as a quantum resource and its potential applications in quantum information theory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Distributed quantum computing leverages multiple quantum devices collectively to perform computations exceeding each device's capabilities. A currently studied technique to enable this distributed approach is wire cutting, which decomposes a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits by cutting connecting wires. These subcircuits can be executed on distributed devices, and their results are then classically combined to reconstruct the original computation's result. However, wire cutting requires additional circuit executions to preserve result accuracy, with their number growing exponentially with each cut. Thus, minimizing this sampling overhead is crucial for reducing execution time. Employing shared non‐maximally entangled (NME) states between distributed devices reduces this overhead for single wire cuts, approaching ideal teleportation with maximally entangled states. Extending this approach to jointly cutting multiple wires using NME states remained unexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating the use of NME states for joint wire cuts, aiming to reduce the sampling overhead further. The three main contributions include (i) determining the minimal sampling overhead for this scenario, (ii) analyzing the overhead when using composite NME states constructed from smaller NME states, and (iii) introducing a wire cutting technique that achieves the optimal sampling overhead with pure NME states, advancing toward wire cutting with arbitrary NME states.",

The closed expression of the Cross Spectral Density Function (CSDF) of the GSM beam after propagation through atmospheric turbulence, atmosphere‐ocean interface, and ocean turbulence are derived. And the correctness of the model is verified by simulating the changes in intensity, relative beam width, and speckle normalized intensity autocorrelation function during the propagation of the GSM beam through the atmosphere‐ocean cross‐medium under different parameters. The findings demonstrate that the intensity of the GSM beam after being propagated through the atmosphere‐ocean medium presents a speckle‐like Gaussian distribution, the intensity of the GSM beam gradually attenuates, the relative beam width gradually grows, and the speckle normalized intensity autocorrelation function gradually decreases as the turbulence intensity and propagation distance increase. In addition, the increase in wind speed at rough sea surface mainly leads to the attenuation of intensity. The work of this paper provides a new idea for the study of atmosphere‐ocean cross‐medium propagation of blue‐green beams.",

A model of a photonic qubit coupled to fiber birefringence and a fiber reservoir representing the environment is proposed. Analytically, a non‐Markovian probability function is derived for the buffered photon and its paired photon. To verify the probability function, full quantum state tomography of the photon pairs is performed. The probability function fits well with the experimental data and physical values. These results indicate that the quantum system operates slightly above the threshold for a non‐Markovian transition. We observe a unique polarization dynamic of the buffered photon. Measures of quantum mutual information are further exploited to study the quantumness of the photon pairs. Werner's well‐known separability criterion occurs at a buffer time of about 0.9 ms. These results imply that quantum discord can surpass Werner's criterion, and hence, quantum bi‐partite correlation can exist for buffer times greater than 0.9 ms.",

Thus far, the differential clock comparison has reached a stability limited by the quantum projection noise of uncorrelated atoms. Overcoming this limit relies on using spin squeezing, where quantum fluctuations of the collective spin undergo a strong suppression in one direction while being enhanced in the conjugation direction. The recent differential comparison of spin‐squeezed clocks mainly employs multiple atomic clouds or sub‐ensembles within one cloud, complicating the clock operation. Here, it is numerically investigated the differential comparison of conditionally and unconditionally spin‐squeezed states of one lattice‐trapped cloud of neutral atoms. The simulation results in a comparison stability of at the averaging time for atoms. The metrological gain reaches dB, primarily limited by the decoherence induced by quantum jumps of intracavity probe photons during quantum non‐demolition measurements. Besides the quantum precision enhancement, our scheme paves the way to using one spin squeezing protocol to appraise the other.",

The scheme exploits the temporal entanglement generated during single‐photon Raman interaction in a chiral waveguide coupled to a cascade of Λ‐type atoms. It is demonstrated that this photon subtractor enables the generation of high‐fidelity and modal purity multi‐photon Fock states. Using a variational approach, the modal structure of the output light is identified, based on a non‐orthogonal basis formed through post‐selection of the output pulses. Within an input‐output network framework, numerical simulations are performed to calculate the quantum state of the output light.

The topological phases of the system are characterized by the Chern number and fractional wave polarization, and the phase‐transition lines (PTLs) obtained from the phase diagrams are consistent with those derived from the zero‐energy condition. It is shown that different PTLs emerge gapless points at different high‐symmetry points of the first Brillouin zone. Moreover, gapless points appear simultaneously at two different high‐symmetry points when two PTLs intersect. In topological phases with a nonzero Chern number, the chiral edge states are present when periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are applied along any one direction. In topological phases with a nonzero fractional wave polarization, there are in‐gap edge states when PBCs are applied along one direction and near‐bulk edge states along another direction. The edge states are present at the anomalous PTLs between two nontrivial phases and are absent at the normal PTLs between the trivial and nontrivial phases. Furthermore, an efficient method is proposed to identify desirable topological edge states based on the impedance of the topolectrical circuit system. The work reveals that the presence of anomalous phase transitions is crucial for understanding the essentials of topological phase transitions.",

In this study, an efficient framework is proposed for simulating open quantum systems on NISQ hardware by leveraging a time‐perturbative Kraus operator representation of the system's dynamics. This approach avoids the computationally expensive Trotterization method and exploits the Lindblad master equation to represent time evolution in a compact form, particularly for systems satisfying specific commutation relations. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated by simulating quantum channels, such as the continuous‐time Pauli channel and damped harmonic oscillators, on NISQ trapped‐ion hardware, including IonQ Harmony and Quantinuum H1‐1. Additionally, hardware‐agnostic error mitigation techniques are introduced, including Pauli channel fitting and quantum depolarizing channel inversion, to enhance the fidelity of quantum simulations. These results show strong agreement between the simulations on real quantum hardware and exact solutions, highlighting the potential of Kraus‐based methods for scalable and accurate simulation of open quantum systems on NISQ devices.

In this work, a feature selection method is proposed with a specific focus on QML. This scheme treats the light‐cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. Its versatility is numerically demonstrated for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way toward applications of QML to practical tasks. Also, this technique could be used to practically test if the QML tasks really need quantumness, while it is beyond the scope of this work.",

It is also a by‐product of the assumptions of Bell theorem about quantum nonlocality. No‐signaling is tested in bipartite systems of qubits from IBM Quantum devices in extremely large statistics, resulting in significant violations. Although the time and space scales of IBM Quantum cannot in principle rule out subluminal communications, there is no obvious physical mechanism leading to signaling. Such signaling is not universal in the relativistic but in a contextual sense. It assumes only lack of interaction between remote parts of the device. The violation is at similar level as observed in the Bell tests. It is therefore mandatory to check possible technical imperfections that may cause the violation and to repeat the loophole‐free Bell test at much larger statistics, in order to rule out signaling definitively at strict space‐like conditions.",

To enhance the robustness of QuNNs, a novel methodology is developed that utilizes three quantum circuit metrics: expressibility, entanglement capability, and controlled rotation gate selection. This analysis shows that these metrics significantly influence data representation within the Hilbert space, thereby directly affecting QuNN robustness. It is rigorously established that circuits with higher expressibility and lower entanglement capability generally exhibit enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions, particularly at low‐spectrum perturbation strengths where most attacks occur. Furthermore, these findings challenge the prevailing assumption that expressibility alone dictates circuit robustness; instead, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of controlled rotation gates around the Z‐axis generally enhances the resilience of QuNNs. These results demonstrate that QuNNs exhibit up to 60% greater robustness on the MNIST dataset and 40% on the Fashion‐MNIST dataset compared to CNNs. Collectively, this work elucidates the relationship between quantum circuit metrics and robust data feature extraction, advancing the field by improving the adversarial robustness of QuNNs.",

Considering atomic diffusion motion, a theoretical simulation model is developed and the spatial distribution of electron spin polarization under the encounter‐propagating dual‐beam configuration is simulated. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dual‐beam scheme achieves a more uniform distribution of electron polarization within the atomic vapor cell. Experiments reveal an 18% enhancement in 129 Xe nuclear spin polarization using the dual‐beam scheme compared to the conventional single‐beam. Through the Fermi contact interaction between optically pumped Rb and Xe atoms, a more uniform spatial distribution of Rb spin polarization reduces the gradient relaxation of Xe atoms and its depolarization effects, thereby significantly enhancing the macroscopic Xe spin polarization and the signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) of NMR sensors.

Benefiting from the chiral magnon‐photon coupling, the signal from different directions can exhibit different optical responses for bistability, transmission, group delay, and quantum noise. Notably, optical nonreciprocity with isolation up to 30 dB can be realized based on chiral‐induced the breaking of Lorentzian reciprocity. Moreover, the introduction of magnon modes can achieve directional conversion between fast light and slow light, resulting in that direction‐dependent nonreciprocal fast‐slow light effect can also be achieved utilizing magnetic devices with chirality. At the same time, the nonreciprocal coexistence range of fast light and slow light can also be efficiently broadened by chiral magnon‐photon coupling strength. Furthermore, it can be observed that the quantum noise spectrum of the system is robust to temperature, even at 50 mK.

Traditional CIM models face two major challenges when addressing large‐scale problems: slowness in convergence and susceptibility to local minima. To address these limitations, the Sliding Mode Control‐Like Coherent Ising Machine (SMCL‐CIM) integrates sliding mode control principles into the feedback mechanism of the CIM, inspired by classical dynamic control methods. Experimental results on random graphs and G‐set benchmarks demonstrate that for the max‐cut problem, SMCL‐CIM achieves an approximately 79. 93% reduction in solution time while improving solution accuracy by 11.4%–15.3% under the same simulation conditions. This scheme provides an efficient and scalable approach to combinatorial optimization, thereby facilitating the broader application of CIM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum algorithms are a crucial component of quantum computing. One key open question in this field is whether quantum algorithms (QAs) can be fully executed on a quantum computer. Many QAs currently rely on classical computers to evaluate conditional statements that quantum systems alone cannot assess. This dependency necessitates information transmission between quantum and classical systems, thus imposing performance limitations. To enable autonomous conditional evaluations on quantum systems, a quantum amplitude‐phase judgment circuit (QAPJC), comprising primarily quantum inequality judgment circuits and equality judgment logic blocks, is proposed. This configuration achieves conditional judgment on quantum computers while imparting physical significance to the judgment process. The feasibility of the circuits is verified on a superconducting quantum computer. Comparative experiments confirm that QAPJC preserves the original performance of QAs while demonstrating the inherent advantages of quantum computing. This circuit can implement logic judgment functions akin to classical circuits and serve as a subroutine for various QAs, promoting their implementation in the noisy intermediate‐scale quantum (NISQ) era.",

The key components of this scheme include a ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere and a whispering gallery mode resonator supporting two counter‐propagating modes. To further optimize the performance of the system, a coherent feedback loop is introduced to reinject the dissipated energy back into the system. This not only provides an additional coupling path for the system but also effectively avoids introducing additional noise caused by measurement. The design significantly enhances both bipartite entanglement and genuine tripartite entanglement. Meanwhile, by spinning the resonator, the cavity modes experience Fizeau drag due to the optical Sagnac effect, thereby achieving nonreciprocal entanglement, which is crucial for applications such as unidirectional quantum communication channels. Additionally, the research demonstrates that even in the presence of backscattering, the entangled state can still recover significantly, highlighting the robustness of entanglement under photon backscattering. This work provides an effective method to enhance and protect quantum resources and holds important application potential for applications in quantum information processing based on magnonics.",

Here, we propose the epitaxial growth of molecular graphene on metal surface alloy, where CO molecules could be naturally self‐assembled into a hexagonal lattice. Via high‐throughput first‐principles calculations, the adsorption behaviors of CO on 30 surface alloys Cu 2 M (M represents the alloyed element) with a ()‐ R 30° superstructure on Cu(111) is explored. By systematically analyzing the structures, energetic and electronic properties of the adsorbed systems with different CO coverages, three surface alloys, Cu 2 Zn, Cu 2 Ga, and Cu 2 Ge, on which molecular graphene can be spontaneously formed, are successfully screened out. Remarkably, the self‐assembled molecular graphene is featured by an effective four‐band model involving the molecular (, ) orbitals of CO on a hexagonal lattice, leading to quantum spin Hall effect.

Here, a link is established between the coherence fraction and the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm, which has several potential applications including cryptography and database search. It is showed that the success probability of the generalized Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm depends only on the coherence fraction of the initial state rather than its entanglement or coherence.

The protocol employs two unitary matrices to encrypt data in a mutually unbiased basis and publishes the hash value of the data, ensuring unconditional security against both internal and external threats. The key rate serves as a critical parameter for proving the security of our protocol. A comprehensive analysis of the key rate's performance is conducted in relation to detection efficiency, depolarization probability, and transmission distance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Images are crucial for digital signal transmission and face significant security challenges due to the growing sophistication of cyber threats. Although classical cryptography based on logistic map is commonly used for image encryption, it is often susceptible to periodic and predictable behaviors arising from specific initial conditions and parameter settings. The predictability poses a risk to the security of encryption system. In response to the challenges, this paper presents a novel image cryptography scheme, as the logistic map image cryptography scheme based on chaotic quantum Boson sampling (LM‐BS), which combines the encryption strength of the logistic map with the inherent unpredictability of chaotic quantum Boson sampling(QBS). LM‐BS scheme takes advantage of the distinctive properties of random interference among bosons in quantum systems, significantly enhancing the sensitivity, randomness, and unpredictability of encryption keys, which effectively addresses the periodicity and predictability challenges associated with traditional chaotic systems. Moreover, the image encryption experiments are put on the silicon photonic chips and the StrawberryFields photonic platform by using LM‐BS scheme on various grey‐scale images. The experimental results indicate that the LM‐BS enables reliable image encryption and decryption, reduces the risk of key leakage, and successfully ensures the security and privacy of image transmission. Overall, the LM‐BS scheme lays a strong theoretical foundation for future encryption based on quantum computation and demonstrates the considerable potential for a wide range of applications.",

Nonetheless, the application of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classification predominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum circuits.

In this study, a Lean Classical‐Quantum Hybrid Neural Network (LCQHNN) is introduced, which achieves efficient classification performance with only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing computational costs. These experiments demonstrate that LCQHNN achieves 100%, 99.02%, and 85.55% classification accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR‐10 datasets. Under the same parameter conditions, the convergence speed of this method is also faster than that of traditional models. Furthermore, through visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes a clear association between these features and their corresponding categories.

Controllable growth of high‐quality, large‐scale InSb nanowire networks is the basis for these applications.

So far, the controlled growth of high‐quality large‐scale InSb nanowire networks still remains a challenge. Here, a groove‐guided selective area growth technique is proposed for InSb nanowire network growth on Ge substrates by molecular‐beam epitaxy. Different from the traditional planar selective epitaxial growth technology, in the proposed method, the material is epitaxially grown at the grooves of the substrate, and the selective growth is achieved by utilizing the atomic diffusion of the epitaxial material on the substrate surface: Selective growth is achieved without using any masks. The InSb nanowire networks grown by this manner have continuous morphology with flat top facets, and they are high‐quality zinc‐blende crystals and exhibit strong spin‐orbit interaction. Due to good repeatability and scalability, the work provides a new solution to grow high‐quality wafer‐scale InSb nanowire networks on Ge substrates.",

Consequently, the atom retains a long‐lived population in the asymptotic time limit. Furthermore, the output field intensity is analyzed and it is demonstrated that blocking one of the coupling channels forces the atomic system to emit photons of a single frequency.

To establish a scalable platform, the single‐photon sources require large on‐chip photon extraction rates, which means the emission rates need to be substantially enhanced and the excited photons should be directly coupled to an on‐chip circuit. The photon emission rate speed‐up is best achieved via coupling to plasmonic nanostructures, while on‐chip extraction can be realized by directly coupling emitters to dielectric nanofibers. However, current approaches to enhance emission speed in nanostructures have inadequately tackled the choice of metals and dielectrics.

Here, drawing inspiration from additive manufacturing, a layer‐by‐layer topology optimization framework is proposed for an on‐chip quantum plasmonic generator that can comprehensively enhance the photon extraction rate of the nitrogen‐vacancy (NV) center. As a result, a topology‐optimized three‐layered hybrid structure is obtained that comprehensively enhances the spontaneous emission rate of the NV center and coupling efficiency into a dielectric nanofiber ().

Whether it is possible to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining the performance of the quantum circuit remains an intriguing research topic. Building spatial symmetry into parameterized quantum circuits is an effective approach to addressing parameter redundancy. In this study, the direct application of the symmetry in XQAOA is investigated and it was found that this application leads to a decrease in the approximation ratio. To address this issue, an improved symmetry‐based XQAOA is proposed, where two‐qubit gates for edges in the same orbit share parameters, while single‐qubit gates have independent parameters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains a comparable approximation ratio while decreasing the number of function evaluations, thereby reducing the cost of training XQAOA.

Moreover, a two‐stage SWAP sequence search algorithm is presented that effectively identifies the most efficient SWAP sequence by distilling feasible SWAP sequences at different stages.

This mixed‐integer nonlinear problem sees computational complexity rise sharply with system size. A consensus‐based distributed quantum decomposition algorithm (QDA) is proposed, splitting the problem into locally relaxed sub‐problems (SPs) and consensus‐constrained master problems (MPs). Multi‐stage strategy is employed to iteratively refine solutions by incorporating cutting planes. For MPs, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization Hamiltonians are designed to be compatible with quantum computing, their complexity is simplified by inserting up/down constraint Hamiltonians that eliminate auxiliary binary variables. Leveraging quantum annealing and a photonic quantum computer, these Hamiltonians are efficiently solved to explore optimal UC and grid topology. Results on the 6‐Bus System validate the centralized QDA, while the consensus‐based distributed QDA outperforms Gurobi9 in operational costs and solution time for the IEEE RTS 24‐Bus System. The joint UC‐OTS optimization reduces costs compared to static networks’ UC, demonstrating the mutual influence of unit and topology optimization. This approach won the Grand Prize of the 2024 “Challenge and Leadership Selection” Special Competition of the 19th National Challenge Cup Competition.",

However, due to issues such as the vanishing gradient and mode collapse, the results generated by quantum generative adversarial models are of suboptimal quality sometimes. Given the robust image feature extraction capabilities of quantum convolutional neural networks, a hybrid quantum convolutional neural network model is incorporated into the quantum generative adversarial network as a discriminator. Different from the traditional multi‐layer linear structure, this discriminator adopts a parallel structure. This parallel structure can analyze both the local and the global features of an image simultaneously. It can promptly detect the defects in the global distribution of generated data, prompting the generator to explore more data patterns and avoid falling into mode collapse. The feasibility of this solution is verified through generation experiments on the handwritten dataset, Fashion‐MNIST dataset, and CIFAR‐100 dataset. The experimental results show that the FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) scores of the generated results on these three datasets reach 14, 20, and 17 respectively, fully demonstrating the performance of this image generation algorithm.",

In this work, a new genuine multipartite entanglement measure based on informationally complete entanglement is proposed, termed the informationally complete genuine multipartite entanglement measure(ICGMEM). A set of entanglement inequalities for pure states in ‐partite systems is first established based on constraints on entanglement distribution. These inequalities reveal that the pairwise entanglement between any individual part of the system cannot exceed the collective entanglement of the remaining parts. Building on these inequalities, a series of geometric structures called informationally complete entanglement measure triangles is constructed and the ICGMEM is defined based on the geometric mean area of these triangles. These results demonstrate that the ICGMEM provides a more refined characterization of entanglement compared to existing well‐known measures. Furthermore, it is shown that the ICGMEM significantly enhances computational efficiency for analyzing genuinely entangled pure states, achieving up to a twofold improvement when the number of subsystems is sufficiently large. Through detailed examples, the advantages of the ICGMEM are illustrated, highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing and quantifying entanglement in multipartite systems.

To illustrate the capabilities of the employed interpretability method, based on the Shapley value approximation, an examplary case study of a NN decoder is provided that is trained for flag‐qubit based fault‐tolerant (FT) QEC with the Steane code. The interpretation of particular decoding decisions of the NN is analysed, by doing so it is revealed how the NN learns to capture fundamental structures in the information gained from syndrome and flag qubit measurements, in order to come to a FT correction decision. Further, it is showed that the understanding of how the NN obtains a decoding decision can be used on the one hand to identify flawed processing of error syndrome information by the NN, resulting in decreased decoding performance, as well as for well‐informed improvements of the NN architecture.

Incorporating the layer into a variational quantum classifier lowers the final training loss by 35 % and halves run‐to‐run variance, evidencing its value for hybrid quantum‐classical workloads. Noise‐calibrated simulations further show that stacking three QMM layers brings the logical error rate to within 20 % of a distance‐three surface code while using an order of magnitude fewer qubits. Because the QMM booster is fully unitary and eschews mid‐circuit measurement, it is directly compatible with platforms where rapid stabilizer read‐out is impractical and provides empirical support for the broader notion that space‐time itself may behave as a distributed quantum memory.",

When long‐range hopping is equal to intercell hopping or negative intercell hopping, where the system experiences phase transition, the circuit exhibits the same voltage at certain sites, and the latter case shows greater robustness than the former. This reason is that the later case with factor in the hopping has a larger gap width compared with the former case. Besides, the longer‐range hopping can change the positions of sites that have equal voltage distribution. It is shown that the robust topological distribution phenomenon can be realized in a real electronic circuit lattice, where some circuit nodes have equal voltage distribution. The equal voltage distribution at certain nodes can serve as a topologically protected voltage divider device, i.e., a topological voltage divider. The robust topological voltage divider shows the favorable effects of phase factor on the real physical system and provides an illuminating example to construct robust electronic device based on topological physics, which may promote the application of topological band theory in developing electronics.",

Reciprocal entanglement and coupling between qubits often lead to unwanted bidirectional interactions and reflections, which degrade quantum states and reduce quantum coherence. This paper introduces a cryogenic‐compatible metasurface that leverages space‐time modulation to enable nonreciprocal entanglement between frequency‐distinct superconducting qubits. This functionality is achieved through a reflective quantum state‐converting metasurface, specifically designed for millikelvin‐temperature quantum technologies. The metasurface utilizes cascaded space‐time‐modulated Josephson field‐effect transistors (JoFETs), offering a transformative platform for advanced quantum state manipulation and entanglement. This spatiotemporal superconductor‐semiconductor metasurface transcends the limitations of traditional linear space‐time metasurfaces by incorporating gate‐controlled Josephson junctions, offering highly efficient spurious‐free state‐frequency conversion. This study demonstrates that spatiotemporal superconducting metasurfaces, particularly those leveraging JoFETs, enable highly efficient quantum state conversion even for superconducting qubits with a high frequency distinction ratio.",

In spite of the tremendous effort to realize and explore topological systems with orbital degree, only s ‐orbital and p ‐orbital states have been found in higher‐order topological insulators (HOTIs). In this work, the existence of d ‐orbital corner states, being the signature of a strong concentrations in the Berry curvature and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is demonstrated theoretically. It has been identified that strong concentrations of Berry curvature, known as pinch points, generate the orbital Hall insulating phase. To achieve the presence of pinch points, a tight‐binding model with a special d ‐orbital configuration with π and σ bonds, in addition to antibonds of the same type, has been proposed. Interestingly, the tight‐binding model configuration is naturally achieved in a photonic model with a breathing Kagome lattice supporting d ‐orbital bands. The topology of the photonic model is characterized by means of the spectral localizer theory and confirms the existence of d ‐orbital corner states in the orbital Hall insulator phase through the vortices generated in the energy distribution. These results pave the way to consolidate the recent branch known as orbitronic and extend the regime to orbitronic photonics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Secret sharing is a procedure for splitting a secret into several parts so that no subset of parts can reconstruct the secret, but the whole set can. In future quantum networks, enabling the splitting of secrets in an anonymous way is of significant importance for splitting secrets among participants while concealing their identities. Generally, multipartite entangled states such as Greenberger‐Horne‐Zeilinger (GHZ) states or W states are used for anonymously splitting secrets due to their symmetry with respect to the parties. However, no particle loss is tolerable for GHZ states, while only one‐particle loss is tolerable for W states in practical quantum networks. In this paper, an anonymous quantum secret sharing (AQSS) protocol is presented by using single particles and Einstein‐Podolsky‐Rosen (EPR) pairs. It is provably anonymous under realistic adversarial scenarios. Due to the anonymity of participants, it naturally removes the risk of participant attack, which is the greatest threat to existing quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols. The protocol is compared with existing ones and show that it has a higher ability of particle loss tolerance than existing ones based on multipartite entanglement. The existence of anonymous protocols without multipartite entanglement provides an important pathway for practical applications.",

Verification of graph states aims to certify whether a quantum state prepared by an untrusted device is close to an ideal graph state or not. Existing verification methods have not considered verifying graph states under an adversarial scenario and noisy measurements. In this paper, a robust verification method for graph states is proposed to overcome this issue. First, a verification model for graph states is designed. Then, two types of verification protocols based on this model are proposed. In addition, the completeness and soundness of the verification protocols are calculated when the measurement devices are affected by noises. Afterward, the measurement strategy of the robust verification protocols is extended from the specific case to the general case. In order to obtain the soundness that scales as , the verification method only requires copies of the graph state, where is the size of the graph state. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effect of noises on the completeness and soundness of the verification protocols.",

Here a scheme is presented to enhance quantum entanglement between two microwave cavity modes using coherent quantum feedback in cavity magnonics. The system consists of a planar cross‐line cavity that includes two microwave cavity modes, with a ferrimagnetic yttrium‐iron‐garnet (YIG) sphere positioned at the intersection of these modes. The magnon mode confined in the YIG sphere can simultaneously be coupled to both microwave cavity modes via magnetic dipole interaction. Additionally, a coherent feedback loop is integrated into one of the cavity modes to modulate its frequency detuning and dissipation. These results demonstrate that feedback control can effectively reduce the dissipation and effective environmental temperature, thereby relaxing the stringent requirement of quantum state generation on extremely low bath temperatures. Furthermore, by enhancing the feedback signal to reduce the high power requirement for activating magnon Kerr effect, the feasibility of the experiment is significantly improved. The scheme finds broad applications in many quantum tasks that require microwave entanglement and other research field that needs to cool quantum systems.",

While composite segmentation schemes are proposed in many systems, their application to photonic quantum gates in dual‐rail configurations has only recently been demonstrated. However, prior research is limited to a small number of segments, full noise correlation, and has overlooked the inherent power loss in such designs. Here, the fidelity and power loss of composite designs for photonic quantum gates with a high number of segments of varying geometrical widths are studied. Using numerical simulations, the relationship between gate performance and the number of waveguide segments, accounting for statistical error correlations and variances is analyzed. Beyond effectively reducing the errors, an asymptotic scaling pattern of quantum gate fidelity and power loss is observed as the number of segments increases. This analysis is examined in Silicon and Lithium Niobate platforms, addressing practical implementation challenges. The findings demonstrate that optimized multi‐segment waveguide geometrical designs significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of photonic quantum gates, paving the way for more reliable quantum information processors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Non‐binary (NB) low‐density parity‐check (LDPC) codes over high‐order finite fields offer error‐correction performance closer to the Shannon limit while directly processing NB symbols, making them well‐suited for continuous‐variable quantum key distribution (CV‐QKD), which inherently involves high‐dimensional data. However, current CV‐QKD implementations have not been deeply researched in this area and still rely on binary error‐correcting codes, limiting the full exploitation of continuous‐variable information. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of CV‐QKD to signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations renders fixed‐rate codes inadequate for practical channel variations. To address these issues, in this work an information reconciliation protocol is proposed based on rate‐adaptive NB LDPC codes. It not only leverages the advantages of using LDPC codes over NB fields, but also exploits their ability to directly correct NB symbols by incorporating rate‐adaptive techniques at both the symbol‐wise and bit‐wise granularity. Simulation results indicate that under identical conditions, reconciliation efficiency increases with field order, reaching 98.90% over Galois Field(GF)(64). In addition, both symbol‐wise and bit‐wise rate‐adaptive techniques extend the applicability of fixed‐rate NB LDPC codes, with the bit‐wise scheme consistently yielding higher secure‐key rates across all fields. Together, these techniques significantly enhance the efficiency and adaptability of CV‐QKD information reconciliation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non‐equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 , 207103 (2023)], it is demonstrated that these quantum‐classical hybrid systems can host not only first‐order dynamical phase transitions – characterized by eigenvalue crossings – but also second‐order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. Two paradigmatic models are analyzed: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence‐induced classicalization enables access to non‐Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, these results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non‐equilibrium quantum states.",

Due to the mutual influence and restriction of these performance metrics, it is a great challenge to realize high‐ Q multiple‐wavelength resonances with each wavelength's emission being directional and distinguished. Here, a non‐circular inner and circular outer (NICO) cavity is proposed, and dual‐wavelength resonant modes with different in‐plane emission directions for the two wavelengths are realized. More importantly, the Q of the two modes in the NICO cavity remains unchanged (100%) compared to the fully circular cavity. To gradually change the inner ellipse shape to the outer‐circle shape, only the coordinates (not the refractive index) are transformed. This transformation makes the cavity easy to fabricate in the experiment. Both the band‐gap confinement effect of the outer circle layers and the gradual change from the inner ellipse shape to the outer‐circle shape significantly halt the Q ‐spoiling phenomena. Solutions of increasing refractive index differences and further breaking symmetry are provided to improve the Q factors (as high as 10 13 ) and narrow the emission divergence angles (by approximately twice), as well as increase the splitting wavelengths (by ≈6 times).",

Despite focusing on colloidal samples here, the histogram‐sampling method itself and its implications are readily generalized to any other form of sample in QY measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atomic magnetometers serve as a type of quantum sensing instrument, offering extensive applications in the field of extremely weak magnetic field measurement. Miniaturized zero‐field atomic magnetometers typically use continuous high‐frequency magnetic fields to modulate atomic spin precession for multi‐axis measurements. However, this modulation induces additional spin‐exchange relaxation, which significantly broadens the resonance linewidth. In this study, the pulsed magnetic field modulation is introduced instead of continuous modulation to reduce the effective duration of the magnetic field. This operation significantly diminishes perturbations of steady‐state spin distribution in Zeeman sublevels caused by Larmor precession during each modulation cycle, thus effectively mitigating decoherence effects. The relationship between spin‐exchange relaxation rate and pulsed field parameters is studied based on the generalized hyperfine Bloch equation, and a spin dynamics model under the pulsed modulation is developed. Agreement between experimental and theoretical results validates the suppression effect of spin‐exchange relaxation and the accuracy of this model. Experimental results indicate that the pulsed modulation scheme results in a 30% reduction in the spin‐exchange relaxation rate and achieves dual‐axis sensitivities of 1.5 and 2.5 fT Hz −1/2 , respectively, representing improvements of 25% and 20% over conventional continuous modulation methods.",

The multipartite Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is commonly employed as a key resource in MCJRSP protocols. However, the depth requirements of unitary circuits for GHZ state preparation and the unreliable long‐distance distribution of GHZ states limit the practical applications of these MCJRSP tasks under current conditions. To overcome these limitations, a practical MCJRSP scheme is presented for remotely preparing arbitrary single‐particle state without GHZ states. This scheme is further extended to remote preparation of arbitrary multi‐particle state. The performance of the protocol is analyzed under certain types of noise, and compare it with existing GHZ‐state‐based protocols. The results indicate that the protocol exhibits superior robustness under noisy conditions when preparing multi‐particle states. Moreover, it requires fewer quantum resources and does not necessitate classical communication. Additionally, the protocol offers a unique advantage: it can tolerate an arbitrary number of non‐responsive agents.

This method involves CNOT operations and measurement of the escort qubits. Modeling the amplitude damping channel with a Lindblad master equation, it is showed analytically that the method achieves unit fidelity under ideal operations, independent of the damping rate, with a certain success probability. This method is applied to teleportation with Bell and W states, and compare its performance with weak measurement and environment‐assisted measurement protocols.

While quantum error correction and mitigation techniques offer potential solutions, they are often limited by the substantial overhead required. To address this, tailored approaches that exploit specific hardware characteristics have emerged. In quantum computing architectures utilizing cat‐qubits, the inherent exponential suppression of bit‐flip errors can significantly reduce the qubit count needed for effective error correction. In this work, how the unique noise bias of cat‐qubits can be harnessed to enhance error mitigation efficiency is explored. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the sampling cost associated with probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) methods can be exponentially reduced with the depth of the circuit when gates act on cat‐qubits and preserve the noise bias. Similar results also hold for Clifford circuits and Pauli channels. The error mitigation scheme is benchmarked across various quantum machine learning circuits, showcasing its practical advantages for near‐term applications on cat‐qubit architectures.",

It is first showed that coherence between the two degenerate excited states of the charger enhances both the average stored energy and the amount of extractable work. Using the concept of global ergotropy, it is further demonstrated that correlations between the two cavity modes enable work extraction beyond the local contributions. Furthermore, it is shown that, among the different coherence configurations, ground–excited state coherence emerges as the most effective, simultaneously enhancing energy storage, extractable work, and stability. Finally, by applying a geometric power bound based on Fisher information and energy variance, it is showed that coherent charging protocols approach the ultimate charging limit more closely than incoherent ones. These findings establish atomic coherence and intermode correlations as valuable thermodynamic resources and highlight the two‐mode micromaser as a minimal yet versatile platform for multimode quantum batteries.",

The interplay of DDI with spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. This work systematically analyzes the effects of the DDI, Weyl‐like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two‐component BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states, emerging in quantum defects, droplets, wheel and ring forms of density distributions, accompanied with transitions of topology of density, and manifesting a critical behavior around a revealed density‐collapse point. A bunch of exotic spin topological structures are shown, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charges. In particular, quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions are found. Rashba‐type SOC and Weyl‐like SOC are also compared. The study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The entropy source of a quantum random number generator (QRNG) is theoretically unpredictable, but in practice, imperfections in local oscillators and measuring devices introduce classical noise that inevitably contaminates the unpredictability of the quantum entropy source. This makes it a challenge for traditional methods to accurately estimate the min‐entropy of QRNG, which in turn poses potential threats to the practical security of such systems. To address this issue, a novel min‐entropy predictor based on deep neural networks is proposed to solve the min‐entropy estimation problem for continuous‐variable QRNG (CV‐QRNG). First, the process of random number generation is systematically analyzed in CV‐QRNG and the deviation between theoretical and practical randomness is discussed. Next, deep neural networks are used to construct a comprehensive min‐entropy estimation strategy. Finally, extensive entropy estimation tests are conducted on various types of real‐world quantum random number data. Experimental results show that the proposed predictor provides higher accuracy and reliability in min‐entropy estimation for CV‐QRNG, while also improving execution efficiency. In conclusion, the proposed predictor offers a simple and effective method for min‐entropy estimation in CV‐QRNG.",

This architecture allows to reversibly switch between the single and the dual EIT‐like behavior without modifying the metamaterial structures. The dual EIT‐like nature is further confirmed through the in‐plane electric field distributions and the slow‐light effects. The specific structural symmetry further allowed us to effectively switch between the dual EIT‐like response and the conventional strong‐coupling responses.

    "abstract": "Abstract Methods of optical dynamic nuclear polarization open the door to the replenishable hyperpolarization of nuclear spins, boosting their nuclear magnetic resonance/imaging signatures by orders of magnitude. Nanodiamond powder rich in negatively charged nitrogen vacancy defect centers has recently emerged as one such promising platform, wherein 13 C nuclei can be hyperpolarized through the optically pumped defects completely at room temperature. Given the compelling possibility of relaying this 13 C polarization to nuclei in external liquids, there is an urgent need for the engineered production of highly “hyperpolarizable” diamond particles. Here, a systematic study of various material dimensions affecting optical 13 C hyperpolarization in diamond particles is reported on. It is discovered surprisingly that diamond annealing at elevated temperatures ∼1720 °C has remarkable effects on the hyperpolarization levels enhancing them by above an order of magnitude over materials annealed through conventional means. It is demonstrated these gains arise from a simultaneous improvement in NV − electron relaxation/coherence times, as well as the reduction of paramagnetic content, and an increase in 13 C relaxation lifetimes. This work suggests methods for the guided materials production of fluorescent, 13 C hyperpolarized, nanodiamonds and pathways for their use as multimodal (optical and magnetic resonance) imaging and hyperpolarization agents.",

We tackle this great challenge by developing a ready to use semiconductor quantum dot (QD)-based device that launches single photons at a wavelength of 1.3 um directly into a single-mode optical fibre. In our approach the QD is deterministically integrated into a nanophotonic structure to ensure efficient on-chip coupling into a fibre. The whole arrangement is integrated into a 19\" compatible housing to enable stand-alone operation by cooling via a compact Stirling cryocooler. The realized source delivers single photons with multiphoton events probability as low as 0.15 and single-photon emission rate up to 73 kHz into a standard telecom single-mode fibre.",

It is critical to understand and quantify how defects change intrinsic properties, and use this knowledge to generate functionality. This challenge can be addressed by employing many‐body perturbation theory to obtain the optical absorption spectra of defected transition metal dichalcogenides. Herein metal vacancies, which are largely unreported, show a larger set of polarized excitons than chalcogenide vacancies, introducing localized excitons in the sub‐optical‐gap region, whose wave functions and spectra make them good candidates as quantum emitters. Despite the strong interaction with substitutional defects, the spin texture and pristine exciton energies are preserved, enabling grafting and patterning in optical detectors, as the full optical‐gap region remains available. A redistribution of excitonic weight between the A and B excitons is visible in both cases and may allow the quantification of the defect concentration. This work establishes excitonic signatures to characterize defects in 2D materials and highlights vacancies as qubit candidates for quantum computing.",

All three platforms are routinely interfaced with quantum dots and other qubits in basic research, which renders a first step toward large scale implementation in quantum applications. A central question regarding the interaction between lattice oscillations and the optically active artificial atoms deals with the characteristic time scales of the two components. The influence of this aspect on the expected optical response on the phononic driving is discussed. Besides well known semiconducting quantum dots and color centers that typically operate in the visible spectral range, the more recently discovered artificial atoms in layered van der Waals materials are discussed. Due to their flexibility and robustness, these crystals promise vast opportunities for future applications. Another important building block lies in superconducting qubits that allow to resonantly generate quantum phonon states and therefore establish the field of quantum acoustics.",

Here a cross‐encoded scheme where high accuracy quantum states are prepared through a self‐compensating, calibration‐free polarization modulator and transmitted using a polarization‐to‐time‐bin converter is presented. The receiver performs time‐of‐arrival measurements in the key‐generation basis and converts qubits back to polarization encoding for measurements in the control basis. Temporal synchronization between the transmitter and receiver is performed with a qubit‐based method that does not require additional hardware to share a clock reference.

Charge exchanges between NV centers and other optoelectrically active defects in diamond are an essential part of the PDMR scheme, impacting the spin‐state control and the performances of the photoelectric readout. Through experimental characterization and modeling, processes governing the spin‐state contrast, in particular the hole carrier contribution to the photocurrent and the role of acceptor‐type defects are discussed. Such acceptor defects can act as traps for free electrons resulting from NV photoionization. Consequently, the hole current can increase at resonance, ultimately leading to an inversion of the sign of PDMR resonances, i.e. to a positive spin contrast. Based on these findings, a method to improve PDMR performances in terms of spin contrast and photoelectric detection rate by selectively ionizing low‐energy acceptor defects using a bias red illumination is proposed. This method is shown to lead to a significant improvement of the photoelectric spin detection sensitivity, important for future practical devices.",

    "abstract": "Finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian system is of great significance in many-body quantum physics and quantum chemistry. We propose an improved iterative quantum algorithm to prepare the ground state of a Hamiltonian. The crucial point is to optimize a cost function on the state space via the quantum gradient descent (QGD) implemented on quantum devices. We provide practical guideline on the selection of the learning rate in QGD by finding a fundamental upper bound and establishing a relationship between our algorithm and the first-order approximation of the imaginary time evolution. Furthermore, we adapt a variational quantum state preparation method as a subroutine to generate an ancillary state by utilizing only polylogarithmic quantum resources. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated by numerical calculations of the deuteron molecule and Heisenberg model without and with noises. Compared with the existing algorithms, our approach has advantages including the higher success probability at each iteration, the measurement precision-independent sampling complexity, the lower gate complexity, and only quantum resources are required when the ancillary state is well prepared.",

Negatively‐charged nitrogen‐vacancy (NV‐) center in diamond is proposed as an excellent single‐photon source at room temperature. The possible optical readout of spin states in diamond makes it a good candidate for the spin‐photon interface. However, poor light collection, feeble zero‐phonon line, low emission rate, and broad phonon‐induced emission limit the use of NV‐ centers in quantum technologies. Here, a feasible, easy‐to‐fabricate, asymmetric Tamm structure coupled with a single NV‐ center to enhance the emission rate of zero phonon line (ZPL) with better light collection efficiency is presented. The asymmetric Tamm structure shows dual resonant mode with one of the modes coinciding with NV‐ ZPL wavelength of 640 nm. The mode quality factor ( Q ‐factor) is 140, which is greater than the Q ‐factor of conventional Tamm structure and hence, improved field intensity localization. The authors achieved four times Purcell enhancement and five times enhanced light collection efficiency at 640 nm. The proposed asymmetric Tamm structure helps to generate bright single photons using NV‐ center and improves the efficacy of the spin‐photon interface.",

These quantities can also be related to solving linear systems of equations. This study presents three related algorithms for calculating transition probabilities. First, a previously published short‐depth algorithm is extended, allowing for the two input states to be non‐orthogonal. Building on this first procedure, a higher‐depth algorithm based on Trotterization and Richardson extrapolation is derived that requires fewer circuit evaluations. Third, a tunable algorithm that allows for trading off circuit depth and measurement complexity is introduced, yielding an algorithm that can be tailored to specific hardware characteristics. Finally, proof‐of‐principle numerics are presented for models in physics and chemistry and for a subroutine in variational quantum linear solving (VQLS). The primary benefits of these approaches are that a) arbitrary non‐orthogonal states may now be used with small increases in quantum resources, b) they (like another recently proposed method) entirely avoid subroutines such as the Hadamard test that may require three‐qubit gates to be decomposed, and c) in some cases fewer quantum circuit evaluations are required as compared to the previous state‐of‐the‐art in NISQ algorithms for transition probabilities.",

In particular, relaxometry (or T1), can be used to detect magnetic noise at the nanoscale. For experiments with single NV centers the analysis of the data is well established. However, due to relatively low brightness and reproducibility it is beneficial for biological experiments to use ensembles. While increasing the number of NV centers in a nanodiamond leads to more signal, a standardized method to extract information from relaxometry experiments is still missing. This article uses T1 relaxation curves acquired at different concentrations of gadolinium ions to calibrate and optimize the entire data processing flow, from the acquired raw data to the extracted T1. In particular, a bootstrap is used to derive a signal to noise ratio (SNR) that can be quantitatively compared from one method to another. At first, T1 curves are extracted from photoluminescence pulses. This work compares integrating their signal through an optimized window as performed conventionally, to fitting a known function on it. Fitting the decaying T1 curves leads to the relevant T1 value. This work compares here the three most commonly used fit models that are, single, bi, and stretched exponential. This work finally investigates the effect of the bootstrap itself on the precision of the result as well as the use of a rolling window to increase time resolution.",

Here, the introduction of the quantum algorithm into classical deep learning is described, which enables it to reliably predict protein‐ligand binding affinity using simple sequence information. Based on different deep learning models, including graph neural networks (GNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), corresponding quantum hybrid deep learning models have been constructed and compared to the classical models. This study has shown that the quantum algorithm can achieve considerable accuracy and good generalization, and show potential to balance between accuracy and generalization, although the parameters used in the model have been remarkably reduced. These models based on quantum hybrid deep learning (QDL) show robust predictions on four benchmark datasets, and exhibit the practical application power in drug screening for targets related to human liver cirrhosis.

They are exploited as noisy intermediate‐scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Indeed, like all real quantum devices, they are affected by noise introducing errors in the computation. Therefore, it is important to understand and characterize the noise sources and possibly to correct them. Here, two machine‐learning based approaches are proposed respectively to estimate the noise parameters and to mitigate their effects using only measurements of the final quantum state. Our analysis is then tested on a real neutral atom platform, comparing our predictions with a priori estimated parameters. It turns out that increasing the number of atoms is less effective than using more measurements on a smaller scale. The agreement is not always good but this may be due to the limited amount of real data that are obtained from a still under development device. Finally, reinforcement learning is employed to design a pulse that mitigates the noise effects. Our machine learning‐based approach is espected to be very useful for the noise benchmarking of NISQ processors and, more in general, of real quantum technologies.",

A popular strategy for solving multi‐class classification problems involves first transforming the problem into many binary classification problems. However, this requires the number of binary classification models that need to be developed to grow with the number of classes. Recent work in quantum machine learning has seen the development of multi‐class quantum classifiers that circumvent this growth by learning a mapping between the data and a set of label states. This work presents the first multi‐class SWAP‐Test classifier inspired by its binary predecessor and the use of label states in recent work. With this classifier, the cost of developing multiple models is avoided. In contrast to previous work, the number of qubits required, the measurement strategy, and the topology of the circuits used is invariant to the number of classes. In addition, unlike other architectures for multi‐class quantum classifiers, the state reconstruction of a single qubit yields sufficient information for multi‐class classification tasks. Both analytical results and numerical simulations show that this classifier is not only effective when applied to diverse classification problems but also robust to certain conditions of noise.",

The interferometric protocol is based on a combination of double Bragg and single Raman diffraction to induce multipath interference in Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) and block selected interferometer paths, respectively. In contrast to previous tests employing macroscopic material slits and blocking masks, optical diffraction lattices provide a high degree of control and avoid possible systematic errors like geometrical inaccuracies from manufacturing processes. In addition, sub‐recoil expansion rates of delta‐kick collimated BECs allow to prepare, distinguish and selectively address the external momentum states of the atoms. This further displays in close‐to‐unity diffraction fidelities favorable for both high‐contrast interferometry and high extinction of the blocking masks. In return, non‐linear phase shifts caused by repulsive atom‐atom interactions need to be taken into account, which we fully reflect in our numerical simulations of the multipath interferometer.

This critical energy in the quantum realm causes symmetry breaking of the wavefunctions and produces a logarithmic divergence in the density of states, leading to an excited‐state quantum phase transition (ESQPT). On the other hand, the Bose–Einstein Condensates (BEC) represent a promising platform to observe quantum mechanical phenomena at a macroscopic level. In this work, the lowest stationary states of the BEC in the mean field approximation are obtained via the Gross–Pitaevskii equation in a double‐well trap. The critical energy at which the corresponding wavefunctions experience the symmetry breaking is estimated. It is also found that this critical energy is shifted from the local maximum of the trap as the interaction between bosons increases. The Wigner function is used to obtain a phase space representation of the stationary states.

In the article, a multi‐mode spin‐mechanical hybrid quantum system is proposed with two‐mode coupling nanomechanical carbon nanotube (CNT) resonators, in which one CNT resonator is loss and the other CNT resonator can be loss, neutral, or gain. The two carbon nanotube (CNT) resonators can interact through a phase‐dependent phonon‐exchange mechanism, which couples them to the same nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond via magnetomechanical effects. By modulating the phase of phonon–phonon coupling and leveraging the Fano‐like resonance phenomenon, double electromagnetically induced transparency can be achieved in this system. This is accompanied by rapid dispersion, resulting in subtle advancements or delays in light propagation. The group index can be manipulated and periodically switched by tuning the modulation phase, with fast‐ and slow‐light effects being particularly pronounced when one CNT resonator is in an active (gain) state compared to lossy or neutral states. This study establishes a foundation for the application of phonon‐mediated optical information storage and processing.",

The effects of phase noise and timing jitter in the control system in conjunction are modeled and experimentally verified with the spin qubit's environmental noise.

The spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) process in atomic ensembles is a candidate for generating heralded single photon sources. However, efficient conversion from atomic spin waves to single photons with controllable temporal length has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. Here SRS is used in a cold atomic ensemble to generate Stokes photons, which herald the generation of the correlated atomic spin waves. By applying read pulses with adjustable duration to the atoms, the spin waves are converted to heralded single photons (anti‐Stokes photons) with controllable temporal length. The conversion efficiency from atomic spin waves to anti‐Stokes photons is improved by utilizing cavity enhancement. The heralded single photons are proved to be nonclassical and to be in a pure state when the photon duration ranges from 100 ns to 3 µs. The conversion efficiency of photons from atomic spin waves is () for the anti‐Stokes photon duration of 3 µs (100 ns).

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum process tomography is an effective method for measuring the quantum channel parameters in the field of quantum information. However, standard quantum process tomography (SQPT) cannot obtain arbitrarily specific process–matrix elements because it requires a global reconstruction algorithm. Direct quantum tomography can be used to obtain specific matrix elements of interest without the need for a global reconstruction algorithm. Therefore, direct process quantum tomography (DQPT) has attracted widespread attention. DQPT based on weak measurements has been recently proposed. However, additional auxiliary states and post‐selection processes are necessary in these schemes, which increases the complexity of practical experiments and reduces the utilization of measurement resources. In this study, a DQPT protocol without the assistance of pointer states is proposed, which reduces the complexity of practical experiments. Subsequently, the scheme is generalized to arbitrary qubit systems and experimentally perform the protocol on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system provided by a quantum cloud platform. Finally, considering that when the qubit resources are insufficient, a superimposed coherent state is used as the pointer state to complete the direct characterization of a quantum process. The measurement protocol is easily scalable and integrated, laying the foundation for direct tomography on a chip.",

However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q‐fid is introduced, a Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q‐fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate‐Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q‐fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of , up to more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic . By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q‐fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise‐resilient quantum circuit implementations.",

Under the limitations of magnetic field control technology and external magnetic field disturbances, current technology is difficult to satisfy the magnetic field precision requirements of NMR sensors to attain navigation‐level measurements. Existing methods typically reduce the sensor's dependence on the axial magnetic field accuracy by closed‐loop control of the carrier frequency. However, because of the limitations of the model and control accuracy, the effect of main magnetic field variations on the sensor performance cannot be overlooked. To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative a method for modeling and compensation the axial magnetic field error of NMR sensors. First, the mechanism influencing of the axial magnetic field change on the system demodulation process is examined, and a physical model describing the axial magnetic field variation and sensor error is established using the Bloch equation; then, the model is simplified based on the principle of ignoring small quantities and function approximation; finally, a compensation experiment of the axial magnetic field error is carried out. Experimental results show that compared with the existing methods, the proposed method achieves a 19.5% improvement in frequency error stability under the condition of axial magnetic field changes.

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel scheme is introduced for achieving nonreciprocal remote quantum entanglement and steering within a driven‐dissipative photonic network. By uniquely coupling optical cavity arrays through a unidirectional bath, this approach innovatively generates robust quantum entanglement and asymmetric Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) steering among cavities at varying distances. This setup challenges the conventional characterization of multipartite quantum correlations and offers unprecedented control over quantum entanglement and steering in photonic systems. These key findings demonstrate that, contrary to short‐range entanglement which is enhanced by correlated length but weakened by stronger driving, long‐range entanglement stabilizes independently of coherence length. Additionally, it is uncovered that forward quantum steering is sensitive to correlated length, while reverse steering exhibits uniform spatial evolution, highlighting an inherent asymmetry in steering dynamics. The observed amplification of steering asymmetry with increasing driving amplitude further underscores the uniqueness of this approach. These findings open new avenues for leveraging quantum remote entanglement and steering in driven‐dissipative photonic networks and inspire the development of advanced integrated nonreciprocal quantum devices.",

In this study, a novel enhancement is proposed to the QAOA, leveraging the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA). This method aims to refine QAOA's performance by facilitating the discovery of optimal parameters through a continuous warm‐start approach, as originally introduced by Egger et al.

Based on a generalization of entanglement swapping with arbitrary two‐qubit states and arbitrary measurements, analytical formulae for the swapping of two‐qudit as well as multi‐qubit quantum states are derived and the exact amount of quantum obesity that is swapped is provided.

Both the bipartite and tripartite entanglement of the three‐mode bosonic system are induced via the nonlinear gain of the two MPAs, which does not require strong coherent parametric coupling. Simultaneously, the intrinsic dissipation and detuning of the quadrature modes are corrected by modulating the phase difference of the MPAs, which directly changes the photon statistical distribution of the microwave cavity, so that both bipartite and tripartite entanglement of the dual‐cavity‐magnon system can be significantly enhanced. In particular, the phase‐modulated (PM) tripartite entanglement reaches the degree of 0.1 and breaks the limit of weak tripartite entanglement (on the degree of 0.01 and 0.001), which is a milestone breakthrough. More importantly, the PM multipartite entanglement is axisymmetric or centrosymmetric with respect to detuning and phase difference, which provides a bidirectional parameter selection for the experimental preparation of strong steady‐state entanglement. Furthermore, the PM multipartite entanglement is accompanied by improved robustness against the thermal bath temperature. The phase modulation mechanism can be potentially applied to construct stable multipartite entanglement networks and quantum information processing.",

The two‐qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and is extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, the persistence of quantum correlations and non‐classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium is investigated, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, the emergence of long‐lived quantum correlations is demonstrated, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong‐coupling are uncovered: in the high‐frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity‐mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit–qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, it is shown that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite‐temperature conditions.",

When nonlinearity is introduced into the system, quantum noise is significantly suppressed. Here, it is studied that how to utilize the joint effect of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC) to achieve force sensitivity that surpasses the standard quantum limit. Our results show that, in the soft‐mode regime (with a negative QOC strength), the sensitivity of force measurement is slightly enhanced compared with the stiff mode (with a positive QOC strength). However, the stiff mode is more effective in maintaining system stability. The introduction of the OPA further enhances the force sensitivity of the system, enabling it to surpass the standard quantum limit even under low‐power conditions. Through a detailed analysis of the noise spectrum, it is demonstrated that both the soft mode and the OPA can reduce shot noise, while the stiff mode can effectively reduce or even eliminate back‐action noise. These findings provide a promising platform for weak‐force sensing research and may also be applied to the development of force sensors based on hybrid optomechanical systems.",

The implantations are performed through thin (100 nm) SiO 2 layers deposited by plasma‐enhanced CVD (PECVD).

Simulations show a subsurface NV center distribution, with the highest concentration near the surface; the expected trends are confirmed by angle‐resolved X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS).

However, InP‐based quantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QLEDs) using zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as the electron transport layer (ETL) suffer from performance degradation due to unbalanced carrier injection. This is mainly caused by the high electron mobility of ZnO, which leads to excessive electron injection into the emissive layer. In this study, Poly(4‐vinylpyridine) (PVPy) is introduced as an electron‐blocking interlayer between the ZnO ETL and the InP‐QD emissive layer to mitigate this imbalance. The insulating nature of PVPy effectively limits electron injection, reducing charge accumulation and enhancing device performance. To further evaluate the role of hole transport layers (HTLs) in conjunction with PVPy, devices incorporating solution‐processed HTLs such as TFB (in p‐xylene), PTAA (in chlorobenzene), and a PTAA–PVK blend are fabricated. A thermally evaporated MoO₃ layer is used as the hole injection layer with Ag as the anode. Devices incorporating the PVPy interlayer consistently outperform those without, confirming the interlayer's role in improving charge balance and overall QLED performance.

Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results.

While phase mismatch primarily drives this asymmetry under minimal decoherence, larger decoherence further amplifies it, underscoring the complex interplay between these factors.

Interestingly, although ground‐state decoherence reduces the generation of temporally correlated photons, it paradoxically enhances biphoton purity, as confirmed through conditional autocorrelation measurements. This counterintuitive phenomenon is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, unconditional autocorrelation measurements show that the generated photons follow a thermal‐state distribution, consistent with theoretical predictions. This study advances the understanding of biphoton generation dynamics and temporal photon correlations in SFWM, offering valuable insights for optimizing SFWM‐based biphoton sources and their applications in quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the process of characteristic mode analysis on metasurfaces, an intriguing phenomenon is observed: when the unit cells exhibit 90‐degree rotational symmetry, the two fundamental modes of the metasurface nearly completely overlap in the frequency domain. However, when the structure of the unit cells lacks 90‐degree rotational symmetry, the two fundamental modes become separated. This phenomenon can be termed modal separation. Research reveals that the cause of modal separation is the alteration of the modal current paths for the two fundamental modes. This discovery provides a novel perspective for designing broadband metasurface antennas. Based on this theory, a broadband circularly polarized metasurface antenna is designed. To successfully excite the two modes that are significantly separated in the frequency domain, a stepped coplanar waveguide (CPW)‐feed radiator is devised. The proposed metasurface antenna is fabricated and measured, with dimensions of 0.42λ L × 0.42λ L × 0.045λ L (λ L is the wavelength in free space at the lowest operating frequency). The measured results show that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 4.2–8.3 GHz (65.6%), a 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth of 5.2–6.8 GHz (26.7%), and a peak gain of 5.83 dBi.",

Time‐resolved photoluminescence measurements yield a short average lifetime of about 0.98 ns, and the cavity design improves the extraction efficiency up to 5.8‐fold, with a value of approximately 3.9 to the first lens.

Meanwhile, the resonance frequencies of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra are spatially encoded by means of an external magnetic field gradient, thereby realizing the simultaneous acquisition of three‐channel digital signals. Over a continuous detection bandwidth of 258 MHz, digital signals can be detected with a time resolution of 3 ms and a minimum signal strength of 0 dBm.

Here, a novel in‐situ magnetic noise compensation mechanism is reported for an atomic co‐magnetometer, which arises from the difference in spin polarization behavior of two alkali metals in a mixed pumping. The magnetometer, which uses the potassium‐rubidium‐neon‐21 (K‐Rb‐) system, successfully decouples the magnetic fields and inertial rotations in situ. In addition, this new paramagnetic system can be used to simultaneously measure the magnetic field and inertial rotations, improving the stability of the measurement.

Given that the quantum circuit of symmetric‐key ciphers frequently serves as the core element of quantum attacks, it has attracted extensive attention. In this work, it is investigated that how the quantum circuit of SM4 and Camellia can be implemented with lower ‐depth. First, a general framework is proposed for designing Substitution‐box (S‐box) circuits with optimized ‐depth. Based on the framework, quantum circuits are respectively designed for SM4 S‐box and Camellia S‐box with ‐depth 4. Compared with existing quantum circuits requiring a ‐depth of 4, our circuits consume fewer qubits and quantum gates, as well as lower full depth. Besides, S‐box quantum circuits are introduced with ‐depth 3 for SM4 and Camellia for the first time. As an application, the designed S‐box circuits can reduce the ‐depth requiring for the subroutine and stand‐alone circuits of SM4 from 132 and 260 in the previous work to 99 and 195. Additionally, the ‐depth requiring for the subroutine and stand‐alone circuits of Camellia‐128/‐192/‐256 can be reduced from 92/126/126 and 108/150/150 in the previous work to 70/96/96 and 82/114/114, respectively.",

The structural asymmetry of Janus monolayers builds in an electric field along the out‐of‐plane direction, which activates the optical activity of otherwise dark excitons. Although the EI formation is independent of whether the exciton is bright or dark, there is a significant difference between bright and dark EIs during the transition from the EI phase to the band insulator. The bright EI is capable of producing coherent radiation, which will provide a clear collective signal for the identification of spontaneous exciton condensation and open up new possibilities for the construction of EI‐based quantum optical devices.",

This study experimentally demonstrates that a Rydberg hybrid quantum‐classical algorithm, termed as quantum‐enhanced simulated annealing (QESA), provides a computational time advantage over standalone simulated annealing (SA), a classical heuristic optimization method. The performance of QESA is evaluated based on the approximation ratio and the Hamming distance, relative to the graph size. The analysis shows that QESA outperforms standalone SA by leveraging a warm‐start input derived from two types of Rydberg atomic array experimental data: quench evolution (QE) (implemented on the QuEra Aquila machine) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) (using the experimental dataset archived in K. Kim et al., Scientific Data 2024 , 11, 111). Based on these results, an estimate is provided for the maximum graph size that can be handled within a one‐day computational time limit on a standard personal computer.

Previous work, CompQSim, partitions a state vector into blocks and uses block compression to conduct larger‐scale in‐memory simulations on supercomputers. Since the effectiveness of compressors depends on the distinctive characteristics exhibited by the circuits during simulations, an adaptive algorithm is designed to employ data compression and secondary storage astutely.

To minimize such costs, two novel simulation algorithms, called BlkQSim and HyQSim are proposed. BlkQSim uses a block‐oriented simulation order to reduce the block processing costs, while HyQSim can further reduce these costs by employing different simulation algorithms on qubits. This study conducts rigorous cost analysis and presents extensive experimental results, which show that compared with CompQSim, BlkQSim and HyQSim can achieve more than 4 and 107 speedups in block processing time, respectively.",

Recent studies have leveraged quantum walk (QW) to tackle such challenges. However, existing QW‐based approaches are constrained by graph structures and prone to recurrent traversal issues. Being different, a novel forward discrete‐time quantum walk (F‐DTQW) method is proposed, which can traverse without redundant visits by prohibiting reverse and lateral propagations. The proposed method significantly enhances the efficiency of critical node identification and is applicable to arbitrary complex networks. The proposed method is validated on typical complex networks such as small‐world, scale‐free, and directed networks, and calculates the transition probability of nodes, corresponding to the centrality measurement index of transition connectivity (TC), which expands from the betweenness centrality (BC) index. The time complexity of F‐DTQW is also analyzed, which is reduced from O ( N 3 ) to O ( N 2 ) compared to the classical method.",

However, environmental noise continues to pose a crucial challenge to scaling up present‐day quantum processors. In the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, decoherence limits the qubits' ability to store information for long periods. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource‐intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the noise can vary in time, making the slow extraction futile as the profile cannot be harnessed to perform error mitigation or correction. Here, this challenge is addressed using a machine learning‐based methodology that outputs the noise associated with transmon qubits with minimal absolute error. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the qubits and then predicting the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolutional neural network pre‐trained on a synthetic dataset. While the protocol is virtually hardware‐agnostic, its effectiveness is validated using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. These rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra are further used to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time‐dependent noise spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "In the fields of quantum mechanics and quantum information science, the traces of reduced density matrix powers play a crucial role in the study of quantum systems and have numerous important applications. In this paper, we propose a universal framework to simultaneously estimate the traces of the $2$nd to the $n$th powers of a reduced density matrix using a single quantum circuit with $n$ copies of the quantum state. Specifically, our approach leverages the controlled SWAP test and establishes explicit formulas connecting measurement probabilities to these traces. We further develop two algorithms: a purely quantum method and a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining Newton-Girard iteration. Rigorous analysis via Hoeffding inequality demonstrates the method's efficiency, requiring only $M=O\\left(\\frac{1}{ε^2}\\log(\\frac{n}δ)\\right)$ measurements to achieve precision $ε$ with confidence $1-δ$. Additionally, we explore various applications including the estimation of nonlinear functions and the representation of entanglement measures. Numerical simulations are conducted for two maximally entangled states, the GHZ state and the W state, to validate the proposed method.",

While several quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods and frameworks exist for text classification and generation, there is a lack of systematic study to compare the performance across various ansätze, in terms of their hyperparameters and classical and quantum methods to implement them. Here, the performance of quantum natural language processing models based on these ansätze is evaluated at different levels in text classification tasks. A comparative study is performed and the QNLP models are optimized by fine‐tuning several critical hyperparameters. These results demonstrate how the balance between simplification and expressivity affects model performance.

These magnetic entities are capable of existing in synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers and exhibit unique dynamic behaviors in comparison to their ferromagnetic counterparts. Micromagnetic simulations are used to analyze the dynamic GHz‐range resonance modes of magnetic skyrmions generated by an out‐of‐plane AC magnetic field in circular‐shaped synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers. In the circular geometry, hybridizations of breathing and spin‐wave modes are shown by the power spectra, which correlate with the coupling strength between magnetic layers. The influence of structural disorder and temperature effects on the breathing resonant modes of the magnetic skyrmions is further investigated in the power spectra of the system using micromagnetic simulations. Skyrmion sensing and a better understanding of skyrmionic states in general may both benefit from the experimental observation of these resonant oscillation modes in synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayer stacks having an antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling.",

Motivated by this perspective, the thermodynamic notion of quantum battery capacity—closely related to ergotropy and defined as the energy difference between maximally and minimally achievable states under unitary evolution—is examined to address state ordering problems. The investigation focuses on comparing state orderings using three measures: battery capacity, entanglement of formation, and quantum discord, with particular emphasis on two‐qubit Bell‐diagonal states. Remarkably, certain classes of these states exhibit identical ordering patterns across all three measures under specific conditions.",

The experimental results indicate that under 365 nm excitation, the decay rate of 1T‐2H MoS 2 exhibited a more rapid decay compared to that of 2H MoS 2 due to the transfer of hot carriers to 1T phase in the heterostructure. Furthermore, under 612 nm excitation, the decay rate of the heterostructure is comparable to that of 2H MoS 2 but accelerated at high pump fluences. This behavior is attributed to the activation of charge carrier transfer pathways at higher fluences as a portion of the electron population acquires sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers across lateral interfaces.

In non‐Hermitian dimerized lattice, the intrinsic connection between the topological flat band and non‐Hermitian phase transition is revealed, which is rarely mentioned in previous works. It is further shown that the non‐Hermitian effect can induce a topological laser in the quantum walk, and significantly, it can be markedly accelerated by the non‐Hermitian flat band. This accelerated transmission phenomenon is counterintuitive since the flat band usually means the localization in Hermitian system. This phenomenon is found to originate from the further destruction of orthogonality of quantum states induced by flat band in non‐Hermitian system, which shows the interesting interplay between non‐Hermitian effect and topological flat band. The investigations show the favorable effects of non‐Hermitian topological flat band on quantum transmission, which may promote the applications of non‐Hermitian topological system in quantum information processing.",

Characterizing entanglement structures—particularly entanglement depth and intactness—has become increasingly essential for quantum information processing tasks. Traditional methods like standard entanglement witnesses assume that experimenters can exactly implement specific quantum measurements. Even minor inaccuracies in standard witness can introduce significant errors in entanglement detection. Certification methods are proposed with relaxed assumptions about the system and measurements for entanglement structures. First, entanglement states are classified with the same intactness into three distinct types based on their depth. Next, analytical witnesses are derived to detect the entanglement structure of general n‐qubit systems in both device‐independent and semi‐device‐independent scenarios, where some observables are untrusted while others remain reliable. Furthermore, this framework is extended to account for small measurement imperfections, ensuring robustness in practical settings. It is demonstrated that this witness can detect larger entanglement regions compared to previous Bell‐type inequalities. Remarkably, for Type I 4‐partite quantum states, this entanglement witness with measurement imperfections is identical to both device‐dependent and semi‐device‐independent approaches.",

Under geomagnetic conditions, the fitted fast and slow relaxation times are 0.56 and 105.67 ms, respectively; under magnetic shielding, the corresponding values are 47.88 and 100.32 ms.

A superconducting qutrit‐resonator chain is mapped into domain‐divided Su‐Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) models in the synthetic dimension formed by product states of qutrits and Fock states, which renders single‐excitation transfers to mimic particle transports in 1D potential array. Large‐scale Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be generated in one‐domain SSH model of synthetic dimension via the topological protected edge channel. Uniquely, a two‐domain SSH model is constructed, and the wave function of the three topological protected states is analytically derived. It is shown that the effective coherent‐tunneling adiabatic passage (CTAP) enables fast large‐scale GHZ state can be generated via topological CTAP. Furthermore, four‐ and multi‐domain SSH models are identified to generate large‐scale GHZ states faster in larger sizes. Numerical results show that topologically generated large‐scale GHZ states exhibit excellent robustness against inevitable variation in ideal hopping rates and losses of systems.

    "abstract": "Abstract Deterministic sources of quantum light are becoming increasingly relevant in the development of quantum communication, particularly in deployed fiber networks. Therefore, efficient fiber‐coupled sources at telecom wavelength are highly sought after. With this goal in mind, the fiber coupling performance of quantum dots is systematically investigated in optical resonators under three experimental configurations. For the first time coupling efficiency and sensitivity are quantified to spatial displacement for single‐mode fibers with 3D printed optics on their tip, and benchmark their behavior over a commercial cleaved‐cut fiber and a standard optical setup. The reduction of the required optical elements when operating with a lensed or a bare fiber allows for an increased end‐to‐end efficiency over a standard setup. For the perspective of realizing a mechanically stable fiber‐coupled source, the spatial tolerance is precisely quantified to fiber‐cavity misalignment, observing less than count rate drop for several micrometers displacement. In the spirit of precise quantification and reproducibility, the experiments are performed on multiple photonic resonators. These results will play a key role in the future development of fiber‐coupled sources of quantum light.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A scheme for the fast detection of multi‐period microwave (MW) pulses is proposed in a four‐level Rydberg‐atom system via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Rydberg‐atom EIT shows a transparency window with coupling of a probe and a control lasers. When the Rydberg atoms are irradiated by a MW field, the output pulse experiences serious time delay due to the medium dispersion. It is interesting to find that the time delay is much reduced when we use a relatively strong probe field. The simulation result indicates that the average time delay of the pulse series can be reduced to 0.32 , which is about 1/8 of that in a single pulse detection. In this case, the nonlinear dispersion leads to fast detection of the pulse's wavefront. For the following pulses, the fast detection is attributed to the Kerr nonlinearity and atomic population dynamics. Moreover, its delay reduction ratio could reach up to 87.2%. The impacts of pulse durations, intervals, and thermal perturbations are also investigated and the scheme shows good robustness.",

The bulk‐edge and bulk‐corner correspondences are rigorously confirmed in terms of dipole and quadrupole moments, which are computed using the Wilson loop and nested Wilson loop methods, respectively. This work investigates Chern, dipole, and quadrupole topological phases in an extended two‐dimensional Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model. Specifically, nonquantized bulk multipole moments are observed in regions with nonzero Chern number, contrasting with half‐integer bulk multipole moments in regions with zero Chern number. Here, two invariants are introduced that capture the topology of nonquantized dipole and quadrupole topological phases. These invariants redefine the nonquantized dipole and quadrupole moments as quarter‐integer values using the parity and topological indices, respectively. The main difference between half‐ and quarter‐integer bulk multipole moments is that the former characterize topological states in the gap, while the latter characterize bound states in the continuum. Moreover, a scheme is proposed to construct a two‐dimensional Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model in a topolectrical circuit. This work provides a more comprehensive characterization of dipole and quadrupole phases in Class‐D Hermitian systems with rotational symmetry.",

In this work, the interplay is explored between spin–orbit coupling, magnetism, and topology in hexagonal‐layered ZrBr monolayers and their doped variants using first‐principles density functional theory combined with Wannier‐based interpolation. By systematically introducing Ti, Ni, and Nb dopants at the Zr site, it is revealed that how the choice of dopant guided by its electronic configuration and periodic table group dictates the resulting electronic and topological responses. Pristine ZrBr exhibits Dirac‐like dispersions with pronounced spin hall conductivity (SHC) near the Fermi level, whereas doping induces distinct modifications: Ti, belonging to the same group as Zr introduces localized states that flatten the band structure and suppress spin transport. Nb preserves dispersive features and stabilizes the topological character and Ni generates emergent magnetic moments, leading to a reversal between SHC and anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), and destabilizes the host lattice. These contrasting effects highlight a doping‐induced crossover between different Hall transport regimes, ranging from topological insulators to trivial and topological metals. These results position doped ZrBr monolayers as a versatile material platform for Berry curvature engineering, offering new routes toward programmable spintronic functionalities.",

Building on previous results for qubits, it is shown that the average distributed entanglement between two parties via ESP is bounded above by the initial entanglement of one of the input pairs, and also by the product of the initial entanglements. Notably, it is found that using initial states with vanishing local quantum coherence is sufficient to capture the essential features of the protocol, simplifying the analysis. By exploring the cases of qubits and qutrits, it is observed that the upper bound on the average distributed entanglement—expressed in terms of the product of the initial entanglements—can be improved, and what this tighter bound might be is conjectured. Finally, the role of quantum complementarity in the ESP is discussed and how local predictability constrains the entanglement that can be operationally distributed via ESP is shown.",

Under the resource theory of coherence, it is interesting to investigate interpretations of coherence measures and the interplay with other quantum properties, such as quantum correlations and intrinsic randomness. Coherence can be viewed as the resource for the intrinsic randomness in the measurement outcomes of a state in the computational basis. We observed in our previous work that the coherence of formation, which measures the asymptotic coherence dilution rate, indeed quantifies the uncertainty of a (classical) correlated party about the system measurement outcome. In this work, we re-derive the result from a quantum point of view and then connect the intrinsic randomness to the relative entropy of coherence, another important coherence measure that quantifies the asymptotic distillable coherence. Even though there does not exist bound coherent states, these two intrinsic randomness quantified by coherence of formation and the relative entropy of coherence are different. Interestingly, we show that this gap is equal to the quantum discord, a general form of quantum correlations, in the state of the system of interest and the correlated party, after a local measurement on the former system.",

Coupling ionics with electronics, memristive devices can exhibit conductance levels quantized in multiples of the fundamental quantum of conductance G 0 = 2 e 2 / h . Since the fundamental quantum of conductance G 0 is related only to physical constants that assume fixed value in the revised SI, memristive devices can be exploited for the practical realization of a quantum‐based resistance standard that, differently from quantum‐Hall based devices conventionally adopted as resistance standards, can operate in different ambient conditions (air, vacuum, harsh environment), in a wide range of temperatures and without the need of an applied magnetic field. In this work, the possibility of using memristive devices for quantum metrology is critically discussed, based on recent experimental and theoretical advances on quantum conductance phenomena reported in literature. Thanks to the high operational speed, high scalability down to the nanometer scale, and CMOS compatibility, memristive devices allow on‐chip implementation of a resistance standard required for the realization of self‐calibrating electrical systems and equipment with zero‐chain traceability in accordance with the revised SI.",

It is based on McLachlan's variational principle applied to imaginary time evolution of variational wave functions. The variational parameters evolve deterministically according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance. Rather than working with a fixed variational ansatz, where the McLachlan distance is constrained by the quality of the ansatz, the AVQITE method iteratively expands the ansatz along the dynamical path to keep the McLachlan distance below a chosen threshold. This ensures the state is able to follow the quantum imaginary time evolution path in the system Hilbert space rather than in a restricted variational manifold set by a predefined fixed ansatz. AVQITE is used to prepare ground states of H 4 , H 2 O, and BeH 2 molecules, where it yields compact variational ansätze and ground state energies within chemical accuracy. Polynomial scaling of circuit depth with system size is shown through a set of AVQITE calculations of quantum spin models. Finally, quantum Lanczos calculations are demonstrated alongside AVQITE without additional quantum resource costs.",

The measurement‐device‐independent (MDI) QKD can remove all security loopholes in measurement devices. However, the large value of the observed error rate in X basis has severely limited its key rate. The four‐intensity protocol with fully optimized post data processing can improve the key rate and distance of MDI‐QKD effectively. In this paper, the four‐intensity MDI‐QKD protocol is reviewed. In the four‐intensity protocol, each of Alice and Bob uses one intensity in Z basis and three intensities in X basis (normally including one vacuum). This improves the number of effective bits in Z basis. The joint mathematical treatment for statistical fluctuation and the parameter scan pointing directly to the final key rate are applied to reduce the effect of statistical fluctuation. The double scanning method further improves the key rate and the secure distance of the four‐intensity protocol. These have greatly improved the performance of the protocol with finite‐key effects. So far, many MDI‐QKD experiments are based on the four‐intensity protocol. The successful results of these experiments have clearly shown the superiority of the four‐intensity protocol in practical long‐distance MDI‐QKD.",

To improve the communication efficiency and enhance the scalability of the quantum networks, a meaningful protocol for controlled cyclic and bidirectional hybrid quantum communication of arbitrary two‐qubit states is proposed, which allows quantum information to be transmitted simultaneously in both directions among multiple participants. With the permission of one controller, each observer can simultaneously transmit arbitrary known two‐qubit states and unknown ones to their adjacent observers, by implementing remote preparation and quantum teleportation in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Furthermore, the participants just carry out some quantum measurements and recovery operations to achieve the communication target, and the desired states can be attained with a unit success probability, thus the protocol is deterministic. Finally, some comparisons are also made with other similar protocols, which shows that the protocol is better in qubit efficiency and communication capacity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Supervised machine learning is a popular approach to the solution of many real‐life problems. This approach is characterized by the use of labeled datasets to train algorithms for classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. The question of the extent to which quantum computation can help improve existing classical supervised learning methods is the subject of intense research in the area of quantum machine learning. The debate centers on whether an advantage can be achieved already with current noisy quantum computer prototypes or it is strictly dependent on the full power of a fault‐tolerant quantum computer. The current proposals can be classified into methods that can be suitably implemented on near‐term quantum computers but are essentially empirical, and methods that use quantum algorithms with a provable advantage over their classical counterparts but only when implemented on the still unavailable fault‐tolerant quantum computer. It turns out that, for the latter class, the benefit offered by quantum computation can be shown rigorously using quantum kernels, whereas the approach based on near‐term quantum computers is very unlikely to bring any advantage if implemented in the form of hybrid algorithms that delegate the hard part (optimization) to the far more powerful classical computers.",

Although considerable efforts have been made, the interlayer exchange mechanism still lacks a clear physical picture.

The detailed atom‐ and orbital‐resolved magnetic exchange couplings are evaluated to reveal the underlying mechanism. The results suggest that the interlayer magnetic ground state of all bilayers are antiferromagnetism (AFM) due to the electronic configuration of cation. While and are found to possess stacking‐dependent interlayer magnetism due to the competition between AFM and ferromagnetism (FM), the dominant interlayer AFM exchange couplings are the and for and , respectively, indicating different underlying mechanisms. These distinct interlayer magnetism can be consistently understood by the number and strength of SSE paths, which can be determined by the rule based on the orbital overlap of mediating anions. Moreover, the atom‐ and orbital‐resolved magnetic exchange couplings are also evaluated in detail, which are in good agreement with the above qualitative mechanism.

In this work, a new layered high‐entropy phosphoselenide compound (MnFeCuCdIn)PSe 3 (denoted MPSe 3 ) is prepared and its structural evolution and property changes are studied at pressures up to ≈60 GPa. It is found that the compound undergoes two isostructural changes at ≈10 and 20 GPa, a structural change forming a high‐coordination phase in ≈32–35 GPa, a semiconductor‐to‐metal transition in ≈28–30 GPa at room temperature, and a metal‐to‐superconductor transition in ≈2.5–4.9 K at a pressure from ≈43 to 58 GPa. Combining data from prior studies, it is further found that for the MPSe 3 ‐type medium/high‐entropy compounds, there exists a linear relationship between the structural transition pressure and the cation mixing entropy, and an inverse nearly linear relationship between the superconducting critical temperature and the cation mixing entropy, with the latter due primarily to the decrease in the Debye temperature.

This method effectively addresses two primary challenges in measuring alkali vapor density. First, it overcomes the limitation of absorption spectroscopy to measure vapor density under optically thick conditions, typically restricted to temperature higher than 420K, equivalent to alkali vapor density exceeding . Second, it mitigates the risk of disrupting shielding functionality due to the application of a strong magnetic field, often in the range of several tens of Gauss or higher, when employing the Faraday rotation for vapor‐density measurement. The spin‐exchange rate between atoms, inherently related to the vapor density, is evident in the electron‐paramagnetic‐resonance spectrum of spin‐polarized , thereby providing a possibility for measuring alkali vapor density. To eliminate overlap between two Lorentzian curves resulting from two decomposed components of an oscillating field, a small rotating magnetic field with identical amplitude and frequency but a 90‐degree phase shift along both the x and y axes is applied. This method is successfully employed to measure vapor density in the temperature range of 373–433 K, with the measured outcomes closely matching the saturation vapor curve.",

To achieve enhanced amplitude of the microwave, superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ) pulse pairs are employed, which can have either the same or reversal polarity, serving as the basic elements of the generator. The SFQ pulse pairs are then combined and wave‐shaped by using a microwave combining filter, which finally outputs desired microwave signals with narrow line‐width. The amplitude of the microwave signal correlates with the interval between two SFQ pulses in a pair and can be adjusted accordingly. To validate the proposal, test chips are fabricated and performed experiments. The experimental results confirm that the method using a reverse‐polarity pulse can maximize the output microwave amplitude and provide control of the initial phase of the output microwave. This improvement offers a superior alternative for generating microwaves using superconducting circuits to control quantum bits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The quest for perfect quantum oblivious transfer (QOT) with information‐theoretic security remains a challenge, necessitating the exploration of computationally secure QOT as a viable alternative. Unlike the unconditionally secure quantum key distribution (QKD), the computationally secure QOT relies on specific quantum‐safe computational hardness assumptions, such as the post‐quantum hardness of learning with errors (LWE) problem and quantum‐hard one‐way functions. This raises an intriguing question: Are there additional efficient quantum hardness assumptions that are suitable for QOT? In this work, leveraging the dihedral coset state derived from the dihedral coset problem (DCP), a basic variant of OT, known as the all‐or‐nothing OT, is studied in the semi‐quantum setting. Specifically, the DCP originates from the dihedral hidden subgroup problem (DHSP), conjectured to be challenging for any quantum polynomial‐time algorithms. First, a computationally secure quantum protocol is presented for all‐or‐nothing OT, which is then simplified into a semi‐quantum OT protocol with minimal quantumness, where the interaction needs merely classical communication. To efficiently instantiate the dihedral coset state, a powerful cryptographic tool called the LWE‐based noisy trapdoor claw‐free functions (NTCFs) is used. The construction requires only a three‐message interaction and ensures perfect statistical privacy for the receiver and computational privacy for the sender.",

Several aspects of the proposed implementation are addressed, analytically and simulatively, and the eavesdropper's information gain by the attack is calculated. Furthermore, it is analytically shown that the scheme results in a small (yet non‐zero) quantum bit error rate, and a comparison to purely theoretical analyses in the literature is presented.

With the recent rapid development of quantum cryptography, quantum‐proof randomness extraction has also been widely studied, addressing the security issues in the presence of a quantum adversary. In contrast with conventional quantum‐proof randomness extractors characterizing the input raw data as min‐entropy sources, it is found that the input raw data generated by a large class of trusted‐device quantum random number generators can be characterized as the so‐called reverse block source. This fact enables us to design improved extractors. Two novel quantum‐proof randomness extractors for reverse block sources that realize real‐time block‐wise extraction are proposed specifically. In comparison with the general min‐entropy randomness extractors, the designs achieve a significantly higher extraction speed and a longer output data length with the same seed length. In addition, they enjoy the property of online algorithms, which process the raw data on the fly without waiting for the entire input raw data to be available. These features make the design an adequate choice for the real‐time post‐processing of practical quantum random number generators. Applying the extractors to the raw data generated by a widely used quantum random number generator, a simulated extraction speed as high as 300 Gbps is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To optimize parameters for laser processing of quantum‐technology relevant materials, such as diamond, precise atomistic simulations of the light‐matter interaction on large scales (on the order of atoms) are essential. Classical empirical interatomic potentials are commonly employed for simulating such a large number of atoms, however they fail to accurately capture all relevant effects of light‐matter interaction. Conversely, ab initio methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) can effectively incorporate quantum properties arising from photon excitations, but their applicability is limited to small systems containing at most approximately atoms. Consequently, bridging the gap between achieving DFT precision and handling millions of atoms necessitates the development of innovative classes of interatomic potentials. In this paper, the construction of a highly accurate interatomic potential for diamond is presented, derived from an extensive dataset of DFT calculations. The parameters of the interatomic potential depend on the electronic temperature ().

Existing studies have primarily focused on Markovian noise sources; however, understanding the relationship between quantum error mitigation (QEM) and non‐Markovian noise sources is essential, as these effects are practically unavoidable in most solid‐state devices used for quantum computing. Here, a non‐Markovian model of quantum state evolution and a QEM cost function of controlled‐NOT (CNOT) gate operation are presented for NISQ devices interacting with an environment characterized by simple harmonic oscillators as a noise source. Using the projection operator formalism and both advanced and retarded propagators in time, the reduced‐density operator is derived for output quantum states in a time‐convolutionless form by solving the quantum Liouville equation. Output quantum state fluctuations are analyzed for identity and CNOT gate operations in two‐qubit operations across various input states and compare these results with experimental data from ion‐trap and superconducting quantum computing systems to estimate the key parameters of the QEM cost functions. These findings demonstrate that the QEM cost function increases as the coupling strength between the quantum system and its environment intensifies. This study highlights the significance of non‐Markovian models for understanding quantum state evolution and the practical implications of the QEM cost function in assessing experimental results from NISQ devices.",

These biphoton sources have the advantage of providing stable frequencies, ultranarrow linewidths, and a tunability of the temporal biphoton width of more than one order of magnitude for high‐bandwidth applications. Therefore, the generated photons can be efficiently interfaced to, e.g., atomic quantum memories. In contrast, solid‐state biphoton sources typically require assistance by an optical cavity to operate at narrow linewidth that limits the tunability of the temporal width of the biphotons. Present state‐of‐the‐art double‐ SFWM biphoton sources can achieve one of the following results: a spectral linewidth of 50 kHz (290 kHz) or a temporal width of 13 (580 ns) with cold (hot) atoms, a detection rate of about 7 cps, and a generation rate of cps at a duty cycle of 0.4% or of cps in the steady state. The theoretical background of these biphoton sources, experimental implementations with cold and hot atoms, and progress over the years, will be illustrated.",

Here, a scheme is proposed for implementing a 1D cavity magnonics lattice that exhibits quantum magnon‐photon Hall insulator behaviors, where each unit cell comprises cavity photons and magnons. By adjusting the system parameters, it is found that not only different energy spectrum structures can be triggered, but also the distribution of the edge states can show the flipping process, which allows the achievement of the multi‐channel topological quantum state transmission. In addition, considering the presence of defects, dissipation, and disorder, it is found that appropriate defects can trigger new topological phases, while dissipation only causes shifts in energy levels without changing the position and period of edge states, and disorder leads to shifts in band structures and edge states, thus demonstrating the robustness of edge states.

The critical system is realized with a single parametrically‐driven bosonic mode involving many non‐interacting bosons. The quantum Fisher information is calculated, which confirms the criticality‐enabled enhancement. The response of one of the quadratures to the variation of the control parameter is further detailed. The numerical results reveal that its inverted variance exhibits a diverging behavior at the critical point.

The system consists of two microwave cavities individually coupled to a common YIG sphere driven by a two‐tone Floquet field, while the output field of the second microwave cavity is fed back into the input port of the first microwave cavity via a coherent feedback loop. Floquet driving can effectively generate two interactions between magnons and photons. Magnons with higher dissipation can serve as a cooling channel for the two cavity modes. Optimal quantum correlations between the cavity modes can be achieved when the competition between these two interactions reaches equilibrium. Subsequently, a comparative analysis is performed on the evolution of quantum correlation with and without coherent feedback, revealing that the presence of a coherent feedback loop in the system not only significantly enhances entanglement and steering but also induces inherent asymmetry in quantum steering regardless of the decay rates within subsystems. Moreover, under the influence of the coherent feedback loop, the enhanced quantum correlations exhibit increased robustness against rising environmental temperatures.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rydberg atom arrays operated by a quantum adiabatic principle are among the most promising quantum simulating platforms due to their scalability and long coherence time. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, they offer an efficient solution for an intrinsic maximum independent set problem because of the resemblance between the Rydberg Hamiltonian and the cost function of the maximum independent set problem. In this study, a strategy is suggested to approximate maximum independent sets by adjusting local detunings on the Rydberg Hamiltonian according to each vertex's vertex support, which is a quantity that represents connectivity between vertices. By doing so, the strategy successfully reduces the error rate three times for the checkerboard graphs with defects when the adiabaticity is sufficient. In addition, the strategy decreases the error rate for random graphs even when the adiabaticity is relatively insufficient. Moreover, it is shown that the strategy helps to prepare a quantum many‐body ground state by raising the fidelity between the evolved quantum state and a 2D cat state on a square lattice. Finally, the strategy is combined with the non‐abelian adiabatic mixing and this approach is highly successful in finding maximum independent sets compared to the conventional adiabatic evolution with local detunings.",

This development is set to revolutionize the applications of quantum computing. This article reviews the concept of QNNs and their physical realizations, particularly implementations based on quantum optics. The integration of quantum principles with classical neural network architectures is first examined to create QNNs. Some specific examples, such as the quantum perceptron, quantum convolutional neural networks, and quantum Boltzmann machines are discussed. Subsequently, the feasibility of implementing QNNs through photonics is analyzed. The key challenge here lies in achieving the required non‐linear gates, and measurement‐induced approaches, among others, seem promising. To unlock the computational potential of QNNs, addressing the challenge of scaling their complexity through quantum optics is crucial. Progress in controlling quantum states of light is continuously advancing the field. Additionally, it has been discovered that different QNN architectures can be unified through non‐Gaussian operations. This insight will aid in better understanding and developing more complex QNN circuits.",

To study and harness such hybrid devices, a key challenge is the realization of highly functional material interfaces with a suitable superconductor featuring 2‐periodic parity‐conserving transport to ensure a superconducting hard‐gap free of unpaired electrons, which is important for Majorana physics. A superconductor well‐known for this characteristic is Al, however, its direct integration into devices based on tetradymite topological insulators has so far been found to yield non‐transparent interfaces. By focusing on Bi 2 Te 3 ‐Al heterostructures, this study identifies detrimental interdiffusion processes at the interface through atomically resolved structural and chemical analysis, and showcases their mitigation by leveraging different interlayers – namely Nb, Ti, Pd, and Pt – between Bi 2 Te 3 and Al. Through structural transformation of the interlayer materials (X) into their respective tellurides (XTe 2 ) atomically‐sharp epitaxial interfaces are engineered and further characterized in low‐temperature transport experiments on Al‐X‐Bi 2 Te 3 ‐X‐Al Josephson junctions and in complementary density functional theory calculations.

The complexity of combinatorial optimization rises dramatically as the dimensionality of the hyperparameter space increases, making hyperparameter selection exceptionally complex. Traditional manual trial‐and‐error methods are both time‐consuming and expensive. To break through this bottleneck, the Ansatz structure set is proposed and the Hyperband algorithm is utilized to combine the structure set with the stacking number and algorithmic hyperparameters to propose the Hyperband‐QNN model. The model can intelligently generate QNN according to the actual data features, and in practical applications in many fields such as medicine and agriculture, it performs well compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the quantum algorithms QSVM and QKNN, and when it is used to deal with the large‐scale data, the efficiency advantage becomes more obvious with the increase of the number of samples. This not only proves the advantages of Hyperband‐QNN model in practical applications but also provides useful exploration and reference for the integration of traditional algorithms and quantum algorithms in practical problems and the play of their respective advantages.",

Especially the presence of controllable non‐conservative processes in optical and photonic systems has triggered the development of singularity‐based sensing. By flexibly tuning gain, loss, and coupling strength, a series of high‐resolution sensing approaches can be realized, with the potential of on‐chip integration. Another important non‐Hermitian singularity is the coherent perfect absorption‐lasing (CPAL) point in the PT‐broken phase, which manifests the coexistence of lasing and CPA, exhibiting intriguing properties with considerable sensing potential. As a crucial method for quantum sensing and metrology, the interaction between light and alkali‐metal atomic ensembles promises unprecedented sensitivity in the measurement of ultra‐weak magnetic field, inertia, and time. Therefore, extending the study of PT‐symmetry and singularity‐based sensing from conventional solid‐state wave systems to diffusive systems such as atomic ensembles is attracting wide attention. In this review, the development of singularity‐based sensing in PT/anti‐PT symmetric non‐Hermitian systems is summarized, with a special focus on photonic platforms including integration with waveguides, microcavities, metasurface, etc. In addition, sensing applications with discussion further extended to atomic ensembles, projecting future research trends in the field.",

To tackle the complexity of strong interactions between two and three nucleons, the states are modeled on the tritium nucleus. Both the initial and final states are represented using quantum circuits with variational quantum algorithms and inductive biases. Describing the spin-isospin states requires four qubits, and a parameterized quantum circuit that exploits a total of 16 parameters is initialized. The estimated energy has a relative error of approximately 2% for the ground state and about 10% for the first excited state of the system. The simulation estimates the transition probability between the two states as a function of the dipole polarization angle.

Room‐temperature emission and detection of spin currents are observed in Ge 1‐x Sn x /Co hybrids through spin‐pumping ferromagnetic resonance. Experiments conducted over a wide range of compositions and strains show that spin current injection is enhanced in Ge 1‐x Sn x solid solutions compared to elemental Ge. The magnetization dynamics reveal an intriguing scenario where the Gilbert damping constant and the spin mixing conductance display a non‐monotonic behavior. The maximum spin‐pumping efficiency occurs at a Sn molar fraction of ≈10 at.% and remains unaffected by the elastic strain built up in Ge 1‐x Sn x films through epitaxial growth on Ge‐buffered Si substrates.

In the 1990s, it was realized in systems of atomic alkali gases. At the beginning of the 21st century, investigators considered its emergence in solid‐state matter, and a BEC‐like phenomenon was observed in the case of bosonic quasiparticles (elementary excitations in solids). Both types of BEC can occur in a condensation in conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. A third type of what has been dubbed a BEC in non‐equilibrium conditions can occur in systems of bosonic quasiparticles (phonons, magnons, excitons); this phenomenon (which can be considered as cases of systems with complex behavior) follows after a certain threshold of intensity of an external pumping source is achieved. In this review, after brief comments on the two types of BEC in equilibrium, a description is presented on how a BEC‐like phenomenon arises in systems of quasiparticles that are driven away from thermodynamic equilibrium, and several examples are described. This description is given within a unique theoretical framework, and a comparison with experimental results is performed; in addition, the possible technological applications are outlined.",

The fluctuations of the global magnetic field do not affect the dynamics of the hybrid qubit that is defined in a decoherence‐free subspace.

For many applications, it is of interest to control the arrival time of single photons emitted by such quantum devices, or even to store single photons in quantum memories.

This work systematically investigates on Pt x Cu 1‐ x /Co/MgO magnetic heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and reports a promising spin Hall material, Pt–Cu alloy, possessing large DL‐SOT efficiency and moderate resistivity. The optimal Pt 0.57 Cu 0.43 has a large DL‐SOT efficiency of about 0.44, as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (82.5 µΩ cm at 5 nm thickness). Moreover, this large DL‐SOT efficiency and the coercivity reduction accompanying with proper alloying contribute to a low critical switching current density (2.37 × 10 6 A cm −2 in the Pt 0.57 Cu 0.43 layer) in current‐induced magnetization switching measurements. Finally, the thermal stability of the Co layer can be preserved under alloying, whereas the switching power consumption can be significantly reduced, being the best performance among reported Pt‐based spin current sources. This systematic study on SOT switching properties suggests that Pt 0.57 Cu 0.43 is an attractive spin current source with moderate resistivity, large DL‐SOT efficiency, good thermal stability, and low power consumption for future SOT applications.",

Here, CaCuO 2 /La 1− x Sr x MnO 3 (CCO/LSMO) superlattices are investigated, where the infinite‐layer cuprate CCO does not have apical oxygen for Cu in the Ca‐plane so that the Mn–O–Cu superexchange coupling can be only present at the MnO 2 –(La,Sr)O–CuO 2 interface. Two different doping states for the manganites are studied, namely x = 0.1 and x = 0.3, corresponding to the ferromagnetic insulating and ferromagnetic metallic states, respectively, in the manganite phase diagram. Linear and circular dichroism in X‐ray absorption by synchrotron radiation at Cu and Mn L‐edges clearly demonstrate that in the absence of apical oxygen in the cuprate block, the magnetic coupling between the LSMO and CCO is weakly ferromagnetic when LSMO is metallic, while it is antiferromagnetic when LSMO is insulating, along with an increased Cu 3d(3 z 2 – r 2 ) and Mn 3d(3 z 2 – r 2 ) orbital occupation. It is proposed that the Mn 3d valence band upward shift driven by the enhancement of Mn 3+ content in the underdoped sample enhances the orbital hybridization. The stronger hybridization at the interface MnO 2 –(La,Sr)O–CuO 2 gives rise to the antiferromagnetic coupling between cuprate and underdoped manganite.",

However, there is a challenge in the previously proposed approach: The machine can be trapped by local minima which increases exponentially with a problem size. This leads to erroneous solutions rather than correct answers. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to overcome this problem partially by introducing error detection and correction feedback mechanism. The proposed machine achieves efficient sampling of degenerate ground states and low‐energy excited states via its inherent exploration property during a solution search process.",

We consider three methods of source excitation: resonant pi-pulse, off-resonant phonon-assisted inversion, and two-photon excitation of a biexciton-exciton cascade, and investigate the effect of the pulse excitation process on the quantum indistinguishability, efficiency, and purity of emitted photons. By explicitly modelling the time-dependent pulsed excitation process in a manner which captures non-Markovian effects associated with coupling to photon and phonon reservoirs, we find that photons of near-unity indistinguishability can be emitted with over 90% efficiency for all these schemes, with the off-resonant schemes not necessarily requiring polarization filtering due to the frequency separation of the excitation pulse, and allowing for very high single photon purities. Furthermore, the off-resonant methods are shown to be robust over certain parameter regimes, with less stringent requirements on the excitation pulse duration in particular. We also derive a semi-analytical simplification of our master equation for the off-resonant drive, which gives insight into the important role that exciton-phonon decoupling for a strong drive plays in the off-resonant phonon-assisted inversion process",

A quantum information unit with higher information capacity is interesting and useful in large quantum information systems, such as quantum computations. The most mature way to increase information capacity is to employ a post‐selection or cascaded method with the biphoton state and polarizing beam splitters to increase the qubits of the entangled state. Another promising processing is shaping the temporal correlations of entangled state to high‐dimensional entangled states to increase the superposed states of each qubit. Based on the photon pair state in a hot atomic ensemble, experiments are conducted to shape its temporal correlations to multi‐periodic Rabi oscillations and nonlinear phase shifts. By employing the external dressing field to quantum transitions, the nonlinear interaction produces multiple frequency modes, shaping the temporal correlation of photon pairs to multi‐periodic Rabi oscillation and proposing a 3D energy–time‐entangled qubit for photon pair state. Interestingly, the maximum peak of the periodic Rabi oscillation can migrate with a longer correlation time because of a nonlinear phase shift. Wave shaping of the photon pair state, therefore, has the potential for applications in quantum information processes with higher information capacity and quantum memory.",

The calculations indicate that the structure can provide coupling efficiency of ≈90% toward the elliptically facet direction and ≈1% in the opposite direction. Further, Purcell factor is enhanced due to the augmented electric field intensity in the ELFA structure.

Here, femtosecond pulsed laser‐induced time‐resolved magneto‐optical Kerr effect magnetometry is employed to investigate magnetization dynamics in different NM/Co 20 Fe 60 B 20 heterostructures, where the NM layer varies as Cu, Ta, W, Pt, Ta/Ru/Ta, and Si/SiO 2 (no underlayer) that differ in SOC strength. It is observed that there is a systematic variation in ultrafast demagnetization time ( τ m ), fast remagnetization time ( τ r ), and Gilbert damping parameter ( α ) with the SOC strength of the underlayer and an inverse relationship between α and τ m , τ r is established due to the dominant contribution of spin current transport in ultrafast demagnetization and fast remagnetization processes. The spin pumping formalism estimates the effective spin‐mixing conductance ( G eff ) for different interfaces, which signifies that the high SOC strength of underlayers results in high G eff indicating more efficient transport of spin current through it. This study suggests that the SOC strength of the NM underlayer plays a significant role in controlling the ultrafast demagnetization process through interfacial spin current transport in a NM/FM heterostructure which can be beneficial for the development of ultrafast spintronics devices.",

Consequently, the parity information of atoms can be read out by a homodyne measurement on the cavity. Parity information can be obtained without destroying the original state of the system, which means that the state can be further applied to other quantum information processing tasks after a parity measurement. The numerical simulation results show that the protocol is robust against systematic error, random noise, and decoherence.

The cellular morphology, intracellular zinc accumulation, as well as the levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, are determined using standard fluorescent methods. For endothelial cells subjected to 50% zinc extracts, deviations from the normal cell shape and cell agglomeration tendency are observed. The culture medium containing the highest amount of zinc ions caused nuclei fragmentation, blebbing, and cell shrinkage, indicating cell death. A potential explanation for the observed phenomena is an overproduction of free radicals. In the case of 1% and 10% zinc extracts, the formation of free radicals is clearly confirmed by relaxometry, while the results obtained by using fluorescent techniques are unambiguous.

This work demonstrates the utility of this scheme by creating a Greenberger‐Horne‐Zeilinger (GHZ) state in one step using parallel gates with one overlapping qubit. It also shows its advantage for circuits by implementing a digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of an interacting spin system, the transverse‐field Ising model. This method effectively extends the available gate depth by up to two times with no overhead when no overlapping qubit is involved, apart from additional initial cooling.

In short, the entanglement loss caused by the dissipation to the bath might be weaken by introducing high‐frequency classical noises properly.

Counterintuitive effects followed, such as complex modal volumes and non‐Lorentzian local density of states (LDOS) of QNMs. One of the fascinating aspects of non‐Hermitian theory is the analogy with quantum mechanics for autoionizing electronic levels where the absorption cross'section is characterized by Fano lineshapes, caused by interference between the probability of absorption in the continuum and in the bound states. In photonics Fano lineshapes can arise from QNM normalization through the complex modal volume. The link between Fano lineshapes in photonic LDOS of QNMs and in the case of autoionizing states needs to be clarified. Here, by developing an analytical model based on the role of losses in the QNM normalization, they clarify the meaning of the phase of QNM normalized fields ( q Fano parameter),linking QNMs normalization to the concept of interference among the resonant and the leaky modes. This inspired the design of photonic crystal (PhC) cavity that exhibits LDOS with Fano character inside the itself, providing a proof of principle on how to mold the radiative lifetime by Purcell effect.",

Among them, the combination of topological photonics and waveguide–cavity coupling system has attracted much attention of researchers. In this paper, TESs and TCSs based on Kagome lattice photonic crystals (PCs) with rectangular dielectric columns are obtained. In addition, a topological waveguide–cavity coupling system is proposed, realizing the energy coupling between the TES waveguide and the TCS cavity. To further improve the performance of the system, a sandwich‐like waveguide and an extended waveguide are used to replace the original TES waveguide. Interestingly, the proposed extended waveguide–cavity coupling system cannot only achieve the excitation of two TCSs at different frequencies, but also has stronger electric field intensity, narrower resonance bandwidth, and higher quality factor than the other structures. This work provides a new path to design high‐performance micro‐nanointegrated optical devices such as filters, lasers, and resonators.",

In the extreme case, where the cavity mirror reflection approaches zero and cannot support any quasi‐bound modes for light waves, conventional bad‐cavity lasers become the cavityless lasing and the cavity pulling vanishes. Consequently, the laser frequency is determined entirely by the atomic transition. This work is dedicated to theoretically explore the potential application of the cavityless lasing in active optical clocks. Without loss of generality, Cs atoms with well‐established quantum control techniques are employed as the gain medium that is pumped by a 459‐nm laser. The clock laser wavelength is 1470 nm. The simulation shows that the frequency stability of the clock laser with feasible physical quantities reaches at 1 s of averaging time, one order of magnitude better than the recently demonstrated compact passive optical clocks that are built upon a two‐photon transition in a hot Rb vapor and upon the modulation transfer spectroscopy of thermal Cs atoms. Such compact cavityless lasing‐based active optical clocks have the broad application prospect in satellite navigation and communications and promise an architecture for the integrated photonic metrology.",

Moreover, we can identify in this digital-analog block decomposition the fundamental elements of a quantum machine learning protocol, in which the agent and the environment (learning units) interact through a mediating system, namely, the register. If we can additionally equip this algorithm with a classical feedback mechanism, which consists of projective measurements in the register, reinitialization of the register state and local conditional operations on the agent and environment subspace, a powerful and flexible quantum machine learning protocol emerges. Indeed, numerical simulations show that this protocol enhances the synchronization process, even when every subsystem experience different loss/decoherence mechanisms, and give us the flexibility to choose the synchronization state.

For instance, neural networks such as Hopfield's associative memory are dissipative dynamical systems in a finite dimensional configuration space with attractors that represent stored patterns. In particular, dissipative dynamical systems with an infinite dimensional configuration space are of broad interest and have the possibility to store and restore complex and strongly distorted data structures. In this work, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) with a dissipative perturbation which creates a frictional force acting on soliton is considered. It is shown that the control of the perturbative term allows one to decrease the velocity of soliton to zero and conserve a positive value of its amplitude. The existence of such a frictional force would suggest that the perturbation makes the zero‐velocity solitonic solution of non‐zero amplitude into an attractor for all evolution trajectories whose initial conditions are moving solitons. This allows a way to store information in the infinite dimensional dynamical system governed by NLSE using principles which are completely analogous to that of Hopfield's associative memory. This approach can be realized with solitons in Bose–Einstein condensates and nonlinear optical systems.",

The graphene layer is thoroughly characterized by means of Landau level spectroscopy which confirms its quasi‐free‐standing nature. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy performed at 1.8 K on the graphene layer in the vicinity of Pb islands shows a reduced superconducting gap of meV, which points to a graphene/superconductor junction of moderate transparency. The variations of the proximity‐induced superconducting gap on graphene are measured as function of spatial position as well as of magnetic field strength. Spatially resolved measurements yield a coherence length of about 175 nm in the graphene monolayer.

However, the functionality to actively control the poling period of nonlinear crystals used in PDC is currently missing, yet would enable to dynamically modify the wavelength of single photons produced in the PDC process. Herein, a detailed GVM study is presented for functional PMN‐0.38PT material which can be dynamically repolled at ambient conditions with fields as low as 0.4 kV mm −1 . The study reveals phase‐matching conditions for spectrally pure single photon creation at 5–6 µm. Further, a practical approach is proposed for on‐flight wavelength switching of the created single photons.

The rather two-dimensional nature of the magnetic subunit imparts large anisotropic anomalous Hall conductivity of 1250 S/cm at 2K. Our investigations suggest that a strong Berry curvature by abundant momentum-space crossings and narrow energy-gap openings are the primary sources of the anomalous Hall conductivity. An important observation is the existence of quasi-dispersionless bands in LaCrSb3 which is now known to increase the anomalous Hall conductivity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antiferromagnets offer unique advantages in the development of spintronics because of the absence of stray field, insensitivity to external disturbances and the ultrafast terahertz eigenfrequency, advancing the development of devices toward small‐size and high‐speed. However, the ultralow read‐out signals of antiferromagnetic spintronics are notoriously smaller than their ferromagnetic counterpart, seriously hindering the development of antiferromagnets. Thus, experimental realization of large read‐out signals in antiferromagnets, especially in vertical devices, is intensely pursued. Here the antiferromagnetic magnon drag effect and a giant on–off ratio of ≈1000 are realized in a vertical sandwich structure of heavy metal/antiferromagnetic insulator/heavy metal (Pt/α‐Fe 2 O 3 /Pt). The read‐out signal can exist up to room temperature, and the detected signal owing to the transmission and blocking of magnon strongly relies on the relative orientation between spin polarization and Néel vector. Benefiting from the nonvolatile characteristic of Fe 2 O 3 , zero‐field vertical magnon transport is achieved. The giant on–off signals in vertical devices that can be tightly packed, can greatly promote the practical application of antiferromagnetic magnon devices toward smaller, faster, and lower energy consumption.",

Since the discovery of the giant magneto‐resistance in 1988, considered as the birth of this field, spintronics continues flooding the market with plethora of devices used in everyday life applications such as hard drive read heads or magnetic random‐access memories, and so on. From a fundamental research perspective, the field is still blooming bringing post‐CMOS perspectives technologically closer to the reality with, for instance, prototypes of all‐spin‐logic circuits and neuromorphic chips. To sustain this intense research activity, a quest for new platform materials is also taking place not only to enhance existing performances but also to generate novel functionalities. In this vein, carbon nanostructures such as molecules, graphene, and carbon nanotubes are among the most sought‐after materials. In this review, spin transport experiments in carbon nanotubes and graphene are first detailed and then, the necessity to consider new hybrid interfaces are highlighted for a better control of the spin injection at the quantum device level.",

    "abstract": "Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem is a cornerstone of modern electronic structure calculations. For interacting electrons, given that the internal part of the Hamiltonian ($\\hat H_{int}$), containing the kinetic energy and Couloumb interaction of electrons, has a fixed form, the theorem states that when the electrons are subject to an external electrostatic field, the ground-state density can inversely determine the field, and thus the full Hamiltonian completely. For a general quantum system, a HK-type Hamiltonian in the form of $\\hat H_{hk}\\{g_i\\}=\\hat H_{int}+\\sum_i g_i \\hat O_i$ can always be defined, by grouping those terms with fixed or preknown coefficients into $\\hat H_{int}$, and factorizing the remaining as superposition of a set of Hermitian operators $\\{\\hat O_i\\}$. We ask whether the HK theorem can be extended, so that the ground-state expectation values of $\\{\\hat O_i\\}$ as the generalized density can in principle be used as the fundamental variables determining all the properties of the system. We show that the question can be addressed by introducing the concept of generalized density correlation matrix (GDCM) defined with respect to the $\\{\\hat O_i\\}$ operators. The invertibility of the GDCM represents a mathematically rigorous and practically useful criterion for the extension of HK theorem to be valid. We apply this criterion to several representative systems, including the quantum Ising dimer, the frustration-free systems, N-level quantum systems with fixed inter-level transition amplitude and tunable level energies, and a fermionic Hubbard chain with inhomogeneous on-site interactions. We suggest that for a finite-size system, finding an invertible GDCM under one single $\\{g_i\\}$ configuration is typically sufficient to establish the generic extensibility of the HK theorem in the entire parameter space.",

Motivated by cooperation in classical communications, cooperative quantum teleportation (CQT) are developed with features of the cooperation referring to allocation of resources and operations among participants. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) are employed to learn the CQT protocols on account of different training scenarios with controls of gate parameters among shared entangled states, measurement, and recovery operations. Numerical results show the CQT protocols can be discovered with unit fidelity regardless of ideal or nonideal channels by training the PQCs with hybrid quantum‐classical (HQC) optimization under full cooperations of the participants. Further, the influence of quantum channel noise on the teleportation performance is explored by parameterizing the entangled states with noise and entanglement parameters under adjustable recovery operations. Simulation results indicate the trained PQC can improve the system performance, which implies the potential denoising capability of the HQC algorithms. The suggested CQT protocols satisfy the underlying properties of universality, randomness, locality and cooperation, and discussions indicate the designed quantum circuits can be optimized in view of quantum and circuit costs by appropriate optimization algorithms for achieving higher state fidelity in the future work.",

A suppression of donor bound exciton, D 0 X, photoluminescence is observed in implanted samples which have been annealed at 700 °C relating to the presence of a dense layer of lattice defects that is formed during the implantation process. Hall measurments at 10 K show that this implant damage manifests itself at low temperatures as an abundance of p‐type charge carriers, the density of which is observed to have a strong dependence on annealing temperature. Using resonant D 0 X photoconductivity, we are able to identify the presence of a hyperfine structure in samples annealed at a minimum temperature of 800 °C; however, higher temperatures are required to eliminate effects of implantation strain.",

As a matter of example, the storage of photons into atomic media represents one key approach to memory‐assisted quantum communication and computing. Here it is shown that the propagation of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot can be deliberately controlled by an atomic vapor under the application of an external magnetic field. The present results enable the use of an atomic vapor as a precise and reliable wavelength selective delay and allows for routing the single photons according to their polarization and the external magnetic field. With an overall delay of 25 ns, it is possible to fine‐tune the arrival time of the photons by more than 600 ps which matches the scale of the quantum dot's lifetime.

Here, functionality of a junction connecting orthogonal linear segments in a 2D trap array to reorder a two‐ion crystal is demonstrated. The secular motion of the ions experiences low energy gain and the internal qubit levels maintain coherence during the reordering process, therefore demonstrating a promising method for providing all‐to‐all connectivity in a large‐scale, 2D or 3D trapped‐ion quantum information processor.",

The creation complexity of quantum states is closely related to the complexity of quantum circuits, which is crucial in developing efficient quantum algorithms that can outperform classical algorithms. A major question unanswered so far is what quantum states can be created with a number of elementary gates that scales polynomially with the number of qubits. In this work, it is first shown that for an entirely general quantum state it is exponentially hard (requires a number of steps that scales exponentially with the number of qubits) to determine if the creation complexity is polynomial. Then, it is shown that it is possible for a large class of quantum states with polynomial creation complexity to have common coefficient features such that, given any candidate quantum state, an efficient coefficient sampling procedure can be designed to determine if the state belongs to the class or not with arbitrarily high success probability. Consequently, partial knowledge of a quantum state's creation complexity is obtained, which can be useful for designing quantum circuits and algorithms involving such a state.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When ensembles of atoms interact with coherent light fields, a great many interesting and useful effects can be observed. In particular, the group velocity of the coherent fields can be modified dramatically. Electromagnetically induced transparency is perhaps the best known example, giving rise to very slow light. Careful tuning of the optical fields can also produce stored light where a light field is mapped completely into a coherence of the atomic ensemble. In contrast to stored light, in which the optical field is extinguished, stationary light is a bright field of light with a group velocity of zero. Stationary light has applications in situations where it is important to maintain an optical field, such as attempts to engineer large nonlinear interactions. In this paper, the stationary light demonstrations published to date are reviewed and a unified theoretical framework that describes the experimental observations is provided. Possible applications of stationary light are also discussed, with a particular focus on all‐optical phase gates for quantum information technology.",

More recently it has been successfully applied to probe collective spin excitations in ferro(i)magnetic bulk samples or collections of paramagnetic spin centers embedded into microwave cavities. The use of this readout technique within a semiclassical limit of excitation is only marginally investigated although it holds for a wide class of problems, including advanced magnetic resonance techniques. In this work, the coupling between a coplanar microwave resonator and diphenyl‐nitroxide organic radical diluted in a fully deuterated benzophenone single crystal is investigated. Two‐tone transmission spectroscopy experiments demonstrate the possibility to reconstruct the spectrum of the spin system with little loss of sensitivity with respect to the resonant regime. Likewise, pulse sequences of detuned microwave frequency allow the measurement of the spin‐lattice relaxation time ( T 1 ). The independent tunability of the probe and the drive power enables one to adjust the signal‐to‐noise ratio of the spectroscopy. These results suggest that electron spin dispersive spectroscopy can be used as a complementary tool of electron spin resonance to investigate the spin response.",

However, the high photon collection efficiency demanded by these technologies may be impossible to reach for “standalone” semiconductor QDs, embedded in a high‐refractive index medium. In this work a novel laser writing technique is presented, enabling the direct fabrication of a QD self‐aligned—with a precision of ±30 nm—to a dielectric microsphere. The presence of the microsphere leads to an enhancement of the QD luminescence collection by a factor 7.3 ± 0.7 when an objective with 0.7 numerical aperture is employed. This technique exploits the possibility of breaking the N−H bonds in GaAsN x :H by a laser light, obtaining a lower‐bandgap material, GaAsN x . The microsphere, deposited on top of a GaAsN x :H/GaAs quantum well, is used to generate a photonic nanojet, which removes hydrogen exactly below the microsphere, creating a GaAsN x QD at a predefined distance from the sample surface. Second‐order autocorrelation measurements confirm the ability of the QDs obtained with this technique to emit single photons.",

The interaction between non‐classical optical modes and quantum nodes, as well as quantum entanglement among multiple distant quantum nodes are the building blocks of quantum network, which enable to achieve a plethora of quantum information protocols, such as distributed quantum computation, quantum state transfer across quantum nodes, and quantum clock network. On one hand, the multipartite non‐classical states of optical modes, which can directly interact with atomic ensembles, are required for the practical applications of quantum network. On the other hand, a crucial goal of quantum network is to unconditionally generate and on‐demand store and retrieve multipartite entangled states in atomic ensembles. This paper presents an up‐to‐date review on recent developments in these areas: multipartite continuous‐variable polarization entangled optical modes have been created by transforming quantum state from quadrature into polarization components; and a scalable quantum network with deterministic entanglement among multiple quantum memories has been constructed by transferring spatially separated entangled optical modes into atomic ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultracold fermionic atoms are proposed to be used in 1D optical lattices to quantum simulate the electronic transport in quantum cascade laser (QCL) structures. The competition between the coherent tunneling among (and within) the wells and the dissipative decay at the basis of lasing is discussed. In order to validate the proposed simulation scheme, such competition is quantitatively addressed in a simplified 1D model. The existence of optimal relationships between the model parameters is shown, maximizing the particle current, the population inversion (or their product), and the stimulated emission rate. This substantiates the concept of emulating the QCL operation mechanisms in cold‐atom optical lattice simulators, laying the groundwork for addressing open questions, such as the impact of electron–electron scattering and the origin of transport‐induced noise, in the design of new‐generation QCLs.",

An important semiconductor qubit system is a double quantum dot trapping two electrons or holes, whose spin states encode either a singlet–triplet qubit or two single‐spin qubits coupled by exchange interaction. In this article, progress on the spin dephasing of two exchange‐coupled spins in a double quantum dot is reported. First, the schemes of two‐qubit gates and qubit encodings in gate‐defined quantum dots or donor atoms based on the exchange interaction are discussed. Then, the progress on spin dephasing of a singlet–triplet qubit or a two‐qubit gate is reported. The methods of suppressing spin dephasing are further discussed. The understanding of the spin dephasing may provide insights into the realization of high‐fidelity quantum gates for spin‐based quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum phononic systems have attracted great attention in quantum science and technology. However, it is quite difficult to realize strong phonon–phonon interactions at the few phonon level in phononic systems, since direct interactions between phonons are generally very weak. Here, the phonon transport properties and the phonon–phonon interactions in a 1D phononic waveguide with embedded silicon‐vacancy (SiV) centers are studied. The authors show that, mediated by the SiV centers, strong phonon–phonon interactions can be realized due to coherent interferences of the emitting phonon waves with the incident waves. In particular, the embedded color centers can induce an effective attractive or repulsive interaction in space for phonons, corresponding to phonon bunching or antibunching. Besides, it is found that a single SiV center can capture two resonant phonons simultaneously, forming a phononic bound state in the continuum. Comparing with photon–photon interactions in photonic systems, the phonon–phonon interactions are stronger for relatively slower phonon velocity and the strongly correlated phonon properties are promising for constructing various all‐phonon quantum devices in quantum information processing.",

The observations are incompatible with any previously reported magneto‐transport measurements. Surprisingly, on the one hand the system exhibits signatures of chiral anomaly such as negative magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect, on the other hand, a number of features are even qualitatively beyond the existing theories. It is found that all the unusual features in transport are controlled by the quantum effects originating from strong spin‐orbit coupling induced spin‐momentum locking, and the traditional Lorentz mechanism plays a minimal role. The results not only open up a new avenue related to magneto‐transport in spin‐orbit coupled metals but also pave a path to engineer non‐magnetic materials as sensors for vector magnetic fields.",

The Raman laser pulses with peak power of 6.4 kW and pulse width of 1.5 ns are obtained. The synchronized Raman laser pulse repetition rate is 14.3 kHz.

This makes it susceptible to changes in factors such as the pump wavelength, crystal temperature, and crystal axes orientation. Such intolerance to changing environmental factors prohibits deployment of SPDC‐based sources in non‐ideal environments outside controlled laboratories. Here, a novel system architecture based on a hybrid linear and non‐linear solution that is shown to make the source tolerance‐enhanced without sacrificing brightness. This linear solution is a lens‐axicon pair, judiciously placed, which is tested together with two common non‐linear crystals, quasi‐phase‐matched periodically‐poled KTiOPO 4 , and birefringent‐phase‐matched BiB 3 O 6 . This approach has the benefit of simultaneous tolerance to the environment and high brightness, which is demonstrated by using the proposed architecture as a stable entangled photon source and a spectral brightness as high as 22.58 ± 0.15 kHz mW −1 with a state fidelity of 0.95 , yet requiring a crystal temperature stability of only ±0.8 °C, a 5 × enhanced tolerance as compared to the conventional high brightness SPDC configurations is reported.

The electron–phonon dephasing occurring in a GaAs multi‐electron double‐quantum‐dot system is studied, in a biased case in which the singlet state is hybridized, as well as in an unbiased case in which the hybridization is absent. It is found that while the electron–phonon dephasing rate increases with the number of electrons confined in the unbiased case, this does not hold in the biased case. A merit figure is defined as a ratio between the exchange energy and the dephasing rate, and have shown that in experimentally relevant range of the exchange energy, the merit figure actually increases with the number of electrons in the biased case. The results show that the multi‐electron quantum‐dot system has another advantage in mitigating the effect of electron–phonon dephasing, which is previously under‐appreciated in the literature.",

However, the example of elemental topological metals is still rather limited. So far, the non‐trivial topological states have been probed in only a handful of elements and that too rarely in a transition metal. By combining the angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and magnetotransport measurements, here, ruthenium (Ru) is experimentally confirmed to be a topological metal, validating a recent theoretical prediction. The ARPES data for Ru(0001) provide evidence of the topological surface state related to the bulk Dirac node. Ru also exhibits a prominent planar Hall effect, thus further indicating its Dirac semimetallic nature. Large electron and hole mobilities are estimated, which are comparable to several topological semimetals. The non‐trivial nature of electronic band of Ru is also supported by the large non‐saturating transverse magnetoresistance.",

More specifically, the effect of cooperative interaction between coherent control and noises in conventional single‐spin systems described by Lindblad master equations is illustrated, with the magnitude of a magnetic field taken as the parameter to be estimated and encoded in the noisy dynamics besides the Hamiltonian. The scenarios of both spontaneous emission and dephasing noise have been analyzed, where the associated quantum Fisher information has been given. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in the realm where quantum metrology is mostly applied in practice, the precision limit under the cooperative scheme in the presence of noises can surpass the ultimate precision limit under the unitary dynamics. On the other hand, multiple‐spin systems have also been considered. It is shown that the coupling between different spins can help realize non‐local parametrization under the cooperative scheme, with the ground state made entangled. This thus leads to the improvement of precision limit, which has been proved and visualized in this article.",

However, research on the junctions with Ising superconductors in atomic‐layer transition metal dichalcogenides, whose superconductivity is resilient to strong in‐plane magnetic fields, has remained elusive. Here the scanning tunneling microscopy study of Ising superconductivity in single‐layer (SL) NbSe 2 island and its long‐range proximity effect to the adjacent graphene with high spatial and energy resolution is reported. It is found that SL NbSe 2 island manifests as an Ising superconductor while the island area is larger than about 800 nm 2 . Moreover, the superconducting proximity effect from the NbSe 2 island generates a superconducting gap in graphene, which can extend to over several tens of nanometers without obvious decay. Such a long‐range proximity effect makes the intrinsically non‐superconducting graphene as a superconductor. More intriguingly, such a superconducting gap can survive under strong in‐plane magnetic fields, following the Ising behavior of that in SL NbSe 2 . This work reveals a brand‐new macroscopic Ising superconducting regime, opening perspectives for superconductor‐based quantum devices with outstanding functionality.",

As natural quasi‐particle excitations in solid state systems, phonons couple to virtually any other excitation and therefore constitute a useful interaction channel between different building blocks in hybrid quantum systems. This work explores how the efficient light‐scattering properties of a single‐photon emitter and the appearance of characteristic sidebands in resonance fluorescence spectra, when interfaced with an arbitrary phonon quantum state, can be utilized for acousto‐optical transduction. Within reasonable approximations, an analytical description for the optical spectra in the low excitation limit is developed which can be used to read the number statistics of the initial phonon state from a given spectrum. It is shown that the readout is faulty in situations where relevant resonant transitions are forbidden due to vanishing Franck–Condon factors, especially when considering spectra with a noisy background. Two possible solutions to this problem are presented: (A) changing the detuning of the laser relative to the single‐photon emitter which modifies the relevant resonant transitions, or (B) increasing dissipation of the single‐photon emitter to promote off‐resonant transitions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamics of complex systems. However, analyzing the resulting spectra can be challenging, and thus may require the use of theoretical modeling techniques. The center‐line slope (CLS) method is one of such approaches, which aims to extract the time correlation function (TCF) from 2DES with minimal error. Since static disorder is widely observed in complex systems, it may be interesting to ask whether the CLS approach still work in the presence of the static disorder. In this paper, the effect of the static disorder on the TCF obtained through the CLS method is investigated. It is found that the steady‐state value of the CLS increases monotonically with respect to the static disorder, which suggests that the amplitude of the static disorder can be determined using the CLS in the long‐time limit. Additionally, as the static disorder rises, the decay rate of the CLS first decreases to a certain value and remains at this value until the static disorder is sufficiently large. Afterward, the CLS begins to fluctuate significantly and thus results in obtaining the decay rate through the CLS method unreliable. Based on these discoveries, the authors propose a method to fix the error and obtain the TCF. The findings may pave the way for obtaining reliable system‐bath information by analyzing 2DES in the practical situations.",

The two‐level system is driven by a near‐resonant strong laser such that the Mollow regime dominates the physical processes in this system. Under certain resonance conditions, a perfect super‐Rabi oscillation between the zero‐photon state and the ()‐photon state of the two cavity modes can take place.

More importantly, the results show that there is an antibunching effect between the strongly‐correlated photon bundles, so that the system behaves as an antibunched ()‐photon source.

However, the current studies are predominantly focused on classical bits as the fundamental information units, and the classical bit can only be located at two poles of Bloch sphere, resulting in limited information capacity. To break such limit, quantum bits (qubits) offer a promising solution since they have superposition states anywhere on the Bloch sphere. Here, a Pancharatnam‐Berry (PB) phase metasurface is used to emulate the qubits. Firstly, it proposes a theoretical concept of analog quantum bit and develops its mathematical and geometrical representations. Subsequently, a meta‐atom is designed as a physical platform to implement the concept of analog qubits. By manipulating the geometric configuration of the proposed meta‐atom, it achieves arbitrary superpositions of polarization states. A PB phase metasurface is experimentally fabricated to validate that the proposed analog qubit can be used to emulate the quantum bit in terms of both mathematical and geometrical representations. This work not only provides a theoretical foundation to go beyond the information limit of classical bits but also develops a feasible physics platform to investigate quantum information metasurfaces, which would complement and revolutionize classical information science.",

Such a task is accomplished by collecting partial images obtained by quantum annealing processes for optimal Lagrange penalty coefficients. The results are compared with those obtained according to the same cost function minimized via genetic algorithms by conventional hardware on a realistic 2D dataset. The outcomes of this work are promising as the reconstructed model is obtained in tenths of iterations instead of the hundreds required in conventional methods. Moreover, for the part of the computation that resides in the quantum processing unit, the computational cost of the single quantum annealing descent is constant with respect to the number of degrees of freedom of the subsurface grid. The implemented method is likely to reveal its full potential on forthcoming quantum annealing devices, outperforming existing techniques.",

Here, direct laser writing (DLW) is used to address this challenge by fabricating 1 µm diameter polymer nanowires (PNWs) in‐contact‐with and perpendicular‐to a QD‐containing GaAs layer. QD emission is coupled to the PNW's waveguide mode, enhancing collection efficiency into a single‐mode fiber. PNW fabrication does not alter the QD device layer, making PNWs well‐suited for augmenting pre‐existing in‐plane geometries. Standalone PNWs and PNWs in conjunction with metallic nanoring devices that have been previously established for increasing extraction of QD emission are studied. Methods that mitigate standing wave reflections and heat, caused by GaAs's absorption/reflection of the lithography beam, and which otherwise prevent PNW fabrication, are also reported. A maximum improvement of ( in a nanoring system with a PNW compared to the same system without a PNW is observed, in line with numerical results, and highlighting the PNW's ability to waveguide QD emission and increase collection efficiency simultaneously.

In this paper, the first quantum secret reconstruction protocol is proposed to protect the reconstruction process.

In the presented protocol, the dealer utilizes the secret to encrypt a privacy quantum state, and sends the encrypted state to a combiner who is chosen by the dealer within the shareholders. With the help of other shareholders, the combiner utilizes the properties of cluster states to recover the privacy quantum state. It is shown that the proposed protocol is secure against several common attacks, including external and internal attacks. Compared with classical secret reconstruction protocols, this protocol not only achieves information‐theoretic security of all shares, but is also more efficient due to the reduced distribution and computation cost. To demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol, a corresponding simulation quantum experiment is conducted on the IBM Q. Furthermore, in conjunction with quantum fingerprinting, it can be directly applied to achieve the task of quantum multiple secrets sharing, since the classical shares can be reused in the proposed protocol.",

By adiabatically traversing parameter space along two different pathways, one can identify ground‐state degeneracies from the breakdown of adiabaticity. It is shown that the approach can discriminate against accidental degeneracies of Andreev levels.",

To quantitatively characterize nonlocal properties of multipartite quantum transformations for encoding and decoding, we analyze the entanglement costs of encoding and decoding quantum information in a multipartite quantum system distributed among spatially separated parties connected by a network. This analysis generalizes previous studies of entanglement costs for preparing bipartite and multipartite quantum states and implementing bipartite quantum transformations by entanglement‐assisted local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We identify conditions for the parties being able to encode or decode quantum information in the distributed quantum system deterministically and exactly, when inter‐party quantum communication is restricted to a tree‐topology network. In our analysis, we reduce the multiparty tasks of implementing the encoding and decoding to sequential applications of one‐shot zero‐error quantum state splitting and merging for two parties. While encoding and decoding are inverse tasks of each other, our results suggest that a quantitative difference in entanglement cost between encoding and decoding arises due to the difference between quantum state merging and splitting.",

The proposal of quantum clock synchronization (QCS) for the gravity‐induced time difference is discussed. It is illustrated how the stability of measurement probability in the QCS proposal is influenced by the gravitational interaction induced by the clocks themselves. It is found that the precision of clock synchronization depends on the energy gaps of the clocks and the improvement of precision in quantum metrology is in fact an indicator of entanglement generation. The quantum enhanced estimation of time difference is also presented and it is found that the quantum Fisher information is very sensitive to the distance between the clocks.",

In this study, a new hybrid classical–quantum cryptographic scheme to protect image information and communication security is developed by combining a quantum key distribution (QKD) and compressed sensing (CS). This method employs a QKD system to generate true random codes among the remote legitimate users and utilizes these random codes to encrypt and decrypt compressed 3D image information based on the CS algorithm. Therefore, this new technique can provide computational security in the image information transmission process by the encryption and decryption of CS algorithm, and the information and communication security can be evaluated in real time by monitoring the QKD system. Furthermore, this technique can directly transmit and reconstruct the compressed 3D image information based on the modified TwIST algorithm, and thus fewer random codes are required in QKD system, which can improve the information transmission bandwidth. Consequently, this technique not only provides a new application of a QKD system but also extends the CS‐based image reconstruction from 2D to 3D. This study may open a new opportunity in the field of information and security communication.",

The thickness modulation is applied around the central region, and has little effect on the fringe electric field, which determines the coupling to waveguides or other cavities. Furthermore, the partial modulation enhances the cratered electric field at positions that are distant from the center point. Therefore, interactions with multiple separated emitters are simultaneously enhanced, and the interaction with a large emitter beyond the dipole approximation is also doubled. The improvement of the nonlocal interactions demonstrates a great potential for the cratered cavity mode profile for applications in quantum photonic networks.",

The cavity is driven by a strong coherent pump and a weak probe field simultaneously in the presence of nanomechanical resonators (NMRs), and the output field can produce a new frequency component called the FWM frequency. In a hybrid Coulomb‐coupled cavity scheme, the existence of optomechanical coupling due to radiation pressure gives rise to the FWM phenomenon, which is shown both analytically and numerically. A controllable enhancement of the FWM intensity is found by tuning the pump field strength and its spectrum disappears upon switching the strength off. A significant enhancement in the FWM spectrum with two peaks is also predicted due to the Coulomb coupling strength existing between two electrostatically coupled NMR 1 and NMR 2 . A suppressive behavior of the FWM signal is also observed upon increasing the cavity decay rate and a substantial modulation in the signal by changing the probe‐pump field detuning. Finally, the FWM spectrum is very sensitive to both the effective resonance frequencies and effective masses of the NMRs.",

Optically addressable color centers in semiconductors can achieve spin localization and are the most promising spin qubit candidates for NISQ technologies. Exploring a suitable and scalable atomic‐like color center is a prerequisite in this context. Here, a symmetry‐protected two‐level system (qubit) derived from a set of naturally separated Bell states in the H 3 center with C 2v symmetry is characterized. The characterized qubit significantly reduces magnetic noise compared with a degenerate triplet in C 3v systems for conventional qubits. The Hamiltonian, including the Coulomb interaction, spin–orbit coupling, and spin–spin interaction, is comprehensively developed using a combination of first‐principle calculations and group theory analyses. Consequently, an intrinsic spin–phonon interface embedded in an optical spin‐polarization loop can enable an effective interrogation of the information of the two‐level system. This study not only paves the way for developing further quantum information science applications utilizing the H 3 center but also provides a competitive qubit candidate for the NISQ era.",

Using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the magnetization distribution was observed directly as the magnetic field was swept antiparallel to the original skyrmion core magnetization, i.e. negative magnetic fields. Due to the topological stability of skyrmions, a direct transition of the metastable skyrmion lattice to the equilibrium helical state is avoided for increasingly negative fields. Instead, the metastable skyrmion lattice gradually transforms into giant magnetic bubbles separated by $2\\pi$ domain walls. Eventually these large structures give way to form a near-homogeneously magnetized medium that unexpectedly hosts a low density of isolated skyrmions with inverted core magnetization, and thus a total topological charge of reduced size and opposite sign compared with the initial state. A similar phenomenon has been observed previously in systems hosting ordered lattices of magnetic bubbles stabilized by the dipolar interaction and called \"topological melting\". With support from numerical calculations, we argue that the observed regime of partial topological charge inversion has its origin in the topological protection of the starting metastable skyrmion state.",

With inputs from experiments and first principles calculations, a thermodynamical model is developed rooted in the scenario of the MIT driven by a 2 nd order Peierls instability. It is found that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity can be accurately fit by the band gap varying with temperature due to the gradual weakening of the Nb‐Nb dimers. The resistivity switching can consequently be understood by dimer‐free metallic domains induced by local Joule heating. In solving the heat equation, it is found that the steady state cannot be reached if the applied voltage exceeds a threshold, resulting in the chaotic behavior observed in the high voltage and current states. With the Ginzburg–Landau theory and the Joule heating equation, the evolution of the metallic domains under bias voltage can be simulated and directly verified by experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of phosphorus doping in the transition metal germanide Mo 5 Ge 3 , which is predicted to be a nodal line semimetal and exhibits superconductivity below T c = 0.75 K, is studied. It is found that Mo 5 GeP x retains the tetragonal W 5 Si 3 ‐type structure up to x = 1.0, and the incorporation of phosphorus leads to a shrinkage of the unit cell volume. Remarkably, T c of Mo 5 GeP x is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude with increasing x , reaching 8.24 K at x = 1.0. This enhancement is attributed to the increases in both the density of states at the Fermi level and electron–phonon coupling strength. Theoretical calculations show that the phosphorus doping leads to a nearly rigid‐band shift of the Fermi level into a local maximum of the density of states. This study unveils that transition metal germanides offer an emerging platform to study the interplay between superconductivity and nontrivial band topology.",

A pair of input and output waveguides is designed to mimic emitting and receiving antennas. The waveguides are separated by a free‐space region filled with poly‐methyl‐meth‐acrylate (PMMA) material, which has a negative thermal‐optic coefficient that causes a decrease in refractive index with an increase in temperature. As the power in the input waveguide increases, the refractive index of the free‐space region decreases, which in turn increases the radiated beam's divergence angle with respect to input power. The empirical findings demonstrate that the non‐linear divergence angle can be written as , where θ 0 represents the divergence angle of the equivalent Gaussian beam, k is a waveguide‐specific constant, and P is the input power. The edge of the receiving waveguide is tapered to adjust the coupling of the divergent beam to the output waveguide. The taper width is optimized to minimize insertion loss. The devices are two orders lengthwise smaller compared to the bulk demonstration, and they exhibit low loss ranging from 0.2 to 10 dB.",

To overcome this limitation, an algorithm based on the transfer matrix model (TMM) to calculate the free‐space emission of such gratings is proposed and demonstrated. Using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, free‐space emission, and transfer matrices of single grating components are characterized. The TMM then combines any number of components to receive the total emission. Randomized benchmarks verify that results from this method agree within 98% with FDTD while reducing simulation time by one to two orders of magnitude. The speed advantage of this approach is shown by maximizing emission of a fifteen‐trench circular grating into a Gaussian mode. It is expected that this novel algorithm will facilitate the optimization of radial gratings, enabling quantum light sources with unprecedented collection efficiencies.",

The second‐order correlation function is analytically calculated, which is in good agreement with the numerical simulation given by the master equation. With energy‐level diagram, the atom‐mechanical mode coupling is found to induces the degeneracy splitting of the states and give the optimal conditions for CPNB and CPTB in this system.

Moreover, some discussions on the experimental implementation in this quadratically coupled optomechanical system are presented.

Herein, a method is proposed to quantify non‐CP processes for identifying and measuring non‐Markovianity without the burden of state optimization and entanglement. This relies on the non‐CP processes as new quantum process capabilities and can be systematically implemented by quantum process tomography. Additionally, an approach for witnessing non‐Markovianity by analyzing at least four system states without process tomography is provided. It is faithfully demonstrated that this method can be explicitly implemented using all‐optical setups and applied to identify the non‐Markovianity of single‐photon and two‐photon dynamics in birefringent crystals. The results also can be used to explore non‐Markovianity in other dynamical systems where process or state tomography is implementable.",

These multi‐frequency harmonics of the fundamental cavity mode are generated when the amplitude of the pumping microwave field exceeds a threshold, and their intensities then scale linearly with the field intensity. The frequency of the cavity mode is equal to the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the planar ferromagnetic film, which overlaps with the magnonic bandgap, providing an efficient mechanism for confinement and magnetic field tunability. The effect reaches saturation when the microstrip feed line covers the entire cavity, making the system feasible for realization.",

By analyzing the energy level structure, it is found that the anharmonicity of the system is the joint action of both the Coulomb interaction and the optomechanical coupling, where the nonlinearity introduced by the latter has a more significant effect on one branch of the conventional phonon blockade. In addition, the phonon blockade can be enhanced by introducing the mechanical parametric amplifier with optimal parameters, where the physical mechanism underlying comes from the multi‐pathway destructive interference. It is found that the phonon blockade is fragile toward thermal noise due to the weak quantum interference, which can be overcome by increasing the driving strength and applying the mechanical parametric amplifier with suitable parameters.

Here, a cavity‐quantum electrodynamics (QED) based repeater scheme is considered to address the losses in the quantum channel.

Several rotation‐symmetric bosonic codes (RSBCs) are compared for encoding the initial states of two remote users connected by a quantum repeater network against the convention of the cat codes and the performance of the system is quantified by using the secret key rate. In particular, the number of stations required to exchange a secret key over a fixed distance is determined and establish the resource overhead.

    "abstract": "Abstract The correlations of fluctuations are key to studying fundamental quantum physics and quantum many‐body dynamics. They are also useful information for understanding and combating decoherence in quantum technology. Nonlinear spectroscopy and noise spectroscopy are powerful tools to characterize fluctuations, but they can access only very few among the many types of higher‐order correlations. A systematic quantum sensing approach, called quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS), is recently proposed for extracting arbitrary types and orders of time‐ordered correlations, using sequential weak measurement via a spin quantum sensor. However, the requirement of a central spin as the quantum sensor limits the versatility of the QNS since usually a central spin interacts only with a small number of particles in proximity and the measurement of single spins needs stringent conditions. Here, the aim is to employ the polarization (a pseudo‐spin) of a coherent light beam as a quantum sensor for QNS. After interacting with a target system (such as a transparent magnetic material), the small Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized light can be measured, which constitutes a weak measurement of the magnetization in the target system. Using a Mach–Zehnder interferometer with a designed phase shift, one can post‐select the effects of the light–material interaction to be either a quantum evolution or a quantum measurement of the material magnetization. This way, the correlated difference photon counts of a certain number of measurement shots, each with a designated interference phase, can be made proportional to a certain type and order of correlations of the magnetic fluctuations in the material. The analysis of the signal‐to‐noise ratios shows that the second‐order correlations are detectable in general under realistic conditions and higher‐order correlations are significant when the correlation lengths of the fluctuations are comparable to the laser spot size (such as in systems near the critical points). Since the photon sensor can interact simultaneously with many particles and interferometry is a standard technique, this protocol of QNS is advantageous for studying quantum many‐body systems.",

In this study, a non‐Hermiticity system by means of quasi‐quantization of energy‐band based on non‐Hermiticity systems is constructed. By employing atomic coherence in the non‐Hermiticity system, high‐dimensional quantized photon correlations underdressed field‐induced parity‐time (PT) symmetry and symmetry breaking through the quantization of energy levels are studied. Such a phenomenon happens at microscopic (nanoscale) when the eigenvalues of dressed energy‐level and multimode entanglement are considered for both real and imaginary parts symmetry breaking. Double dressing effect is observed with more coherent channels and larger information capacity than single dressing in the energy‐level cascaded four‐wave mixing system. The study found that the splitting of the real part is larger than an imaginary part in a second‐order system, and the imaginary part splitting is also greater than the real part splitting in a third‐order system. The real part (in phase) is constructive dressing quantization, and the imaginary (out of phase) is destructive dressing quantization.

Characterizations of X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that it locates in a 1‐µm‐order‐thick polycrystalline surface layer that shows a rock‐salt type structure, with a lattice constant of 0.454 nm, and can be chemically identified as K x TaO y (0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.08, 1.24 ≤ y ≤ 1.35), depending on annealing conditions.

The T c observed here is much higher than that of KTaO 3 , Ta, and pure TaO, and is also one of the highest among of all the known oxide superconductors with the same rock‐salt structure.

For the Constrained Binary Optimization with Unconstrained Variables Problems (CBO‐UVPs), the mixed operators in the QAOA+ circuit are applied to the constrained variables, while the single‐qubit rotating gates operate on the unconstrained variables. The expressibility of this circuit is limited by the shortage of two‐qubit gates and the parameter sharing in the single‐qubit rotating gates, which consequently impacts the performance of QAOA+ for solving CBO‐UVPs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a suitable ansatz for CBO‐UVPs. In this paper, the Variational Quantum Algorithm‐Preserving Feasible Space (VQA‐PFS) ansatz is proposed, exemplified by the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP), that applies mixed operators on constrained variables while employing Hardware‐Efficient Ansatz (HEA) on unconstrained variables. The numerical results demonstrate that VQA‐PFS significantly enhances the probability of success and exhibits faster convergence than QAOA+, Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and HEA. Furthermore, VQA‐PFS reduces the circuit depth dramatically compared to QAOA+ and QAOA. The algorithm is general and instructive in tackling CBO‐UVPs.",

In this article, an arbitrated quantum digital signature scheme is proposed, in which the signature can be verified by multiple receivers simultaneously, and meanwhile, the transferability of the signature is still kept. This scheme can be simplified performed to various quantum secure networks, due to the proposed efficient signature calculation procedure with low secure key consumption and low computation complexity, by employing one‐time universal hashing algorithm and a one‐time pad encryption scheme. The evaluation results show that this scheme uses at least two orders of magnitude less key than existing signature schemes with transferability when signing files of the same length with the same number of receivers and security parameter settings.",

Zero‐noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a commonly used method, where noise is amplified, and the target expectation is extrapolated to a noise‐free point. However, ZNE relies on assumptions about error rates based on the error model. In this study, a purity‐assisted zero‐noise extrapolation (pZNE) method is utilized to address limitations in error rate assumptions and enhance the extrapolation process. The pZNE is based on the Pauli diagonal error model implemented using the Pauli twirling technique. Although this method does not significantly reduce the bias of routine ZNE, it extends its effectiveness to a wider range of error rates where routine ZNE may face limitations. In addition, the practicality of the pZNE method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments on the online quantum computation platform, Quafu . Comparisons with routine ZNE and virtual distillation methods show that biases in extrapolation methods increase with error rates and may become divergent at high error rates. The bias of pZNE is slightly lower than routine ZNE, while its error rate threshold surpasses that of routine ZNE. Furthermore, for full density matrix information, the pZNE method is more efficient than the routine ZNE.",

First, an analytical steady‐state output model for the comagnetometer with two alkali‐metal atoms and one noble‐gas atom is presented. By varying the diameter of the pumping laser beam to control the PLIU, 3D distribution models of the electron spin and nuclear spin polarization under different PLIU conditions are obtained. In the experiment, the effects of PLIU on multi‐parameter, low‐frequency magnetic‐noise suppression capability, and long‐term stability of the SERF comagnetometer are studied. The results indicate that within a certain range, increasing the diameter of the pumping laser beam improves the polarization uniformity of the atomic ensemble and reduces the light shift of the comagnetometer. As a result, both the low‐frequency magnetic noise suppression capability and the long‐term stability of the system increase. However, further reduction of the pumping laser diameter leads to a reversal of the system performance metrics, suggesting the presence of a tipping point.

Building thereupon, success of such approaches in providing microscopic justification for the famed Mott criterion, as well as in the attempts to model emerging devices is reviewed briefly. The study is concluded with a discussion of a class of Mott insulators modeled by the Kugel‐Khomskii model, and discuss how progress in the understanding of novel quantum liquid‐crystal‐like order provides an attractive opportunity to gain insight into topologically ordered states and topological‐to‐trivial phase transitions for certain quantum spin models in terms of a dual description in terms of Landau‐like symmetry breaking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum state transfer is the act of transferring quantum information from one system in a quantum network to another without physically transporting carriers of quantum information, but instead engineering a Hamiltonian such that the state of the sender is transferred to the receiver through the dynamics of the whole network. A generalization of quantum state transfer called quantum routing concerns simultaneous transfers between multiple pairs in a quantum network, imposing limitations on its structure. This study considers transfer of Gaussian states over noisy quantum networks with modular structure, which have been identified as a suitable platform for quantum routing. Two noise models are compared, affecting either the network topology or the network constituents, studying their effects on both the transfer fidelities and the network properties. The two models are found to affect different features of the network allowing for the identification and quantification of the noise. These features are then used as a guide toward different strategies for the compensation of the noise, and to examine how the compensation strategies perform. The results show that in general, modular networks are more robust to noise than monolithic ones.",

Efficiently simulating the rich, non‐unitary dynamics of open quantum systems remains challenging on NISQ hardware. Current simulation methods for open quantum systems employ time‐stepped Trotter product formulas (“Trotterization”) which can scale poorly with respect to the simulation time and system dimension. Here, a new simulation method is proposed based on the derivation of a time‐perturbative Kraus operator series representation of the system. A class of open quantum systems is identified for which this method produces circuits of time‐independent depth, which may serve as a desirable alternative to Trotterization, especially on NISQ devices.",

Classical solvers struggle with their non‐polynomial complexity. Although heuristic algorithms are widely used, they often fall short in execution time and accuracy, increasing the interest in quantum computing alternatives using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. However, current Noisy Intermediate‐Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers and future early fault‐tolerant quantum devices face limitations in qubit availability and circuit depth, necessitating preprocessing to reduce problem complexity. This study introduces Qoolchain, a QUBO preprocessing toolchain designed to reduce problem size and enhance solver performance. Developed in Cython, Qoolchain is compatible with major quantum frameworks and optimized for the Grover Adaptive Search (GAS) algorithm. It includes steps like persistency identification, decomposition, and probing to estimate function bounds, all with polynomial complexity. Qoolchain also proposes using the Grover Search algorithm for problem segments whose optimal value is known a priori from graph theory and Shannon decomposition to reduce QUBO problem complexity further. Evaluated against the D‐Wave preprocessing toolchain on various problems, Qoolchain demonstrates higher efficiency and accuracy. It represents a significant advancement in enabling practical quantum solvers, addressing hardware limitations, and solving complex industry‐relevant problems.",

In this paper, a direct purification technique that utilizes weak measurement and requires only two copies of the entangled state is proposed. The method involves transforming the damped entangled state with weak measurements and then applying a direct purification process. This approach yields a maximally entangled state with a certain probability. In the context of Bell state purification, two weak measurement‐based operations designed to convert amplitude‐damped Bell states into the desired state for direct purification method are presented. The first operation is applied prior to the noisy channel, while the second is employed after the noisy channel. Through comprehensive analysis, the performances of these two schemes are evaluated and compared and benchmarked them against a pioneering weak measurement‐based scheme. The findings demonstrate that the proposed methods exhibit superior performance in terms of both fidelity and probability. Additionally, a novel technique for purifying multipartite amplitude‐damped Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states is introduced, which existing methods cannot address. By employing only two copies of the entangled states and harnessing the unique advantages of weak measurement operations, the method achieves both resource efficiency and effectiveness.",

Enhancements of at least 10 11 are theoretically shown for structures with 100 nm features, and much greater potential enhancements are predicted with this method.

Here, a scheme to realize geometric quantum gates with noncyclic and nonadiabatic evolution via invariant‐based shortcuts is proposed, where universal quantum gates can be induced in one step without path mutation and the gate time is also effectively shortened. Our numerical simulations show that, comparing with the conventional dynamical gates, the constructed geometric gates have stronger resistance not only to systematic errors, induced by both qubit‐frequency drift and the deviation of the amplitude of the driving fields, but also to environment‐induced decoherence effect. In addition, this scheme can also be implemented on a superconducting circuit platform, with the fidelities of single‐qubit and two‐qubit gates higher than 99.97% and 99.84%, respectively. Therefore, this scheme provides a promising way to realize high‐fidelity fault‐tolerant quantum gates for scalable quantum computation.",

However, although the notable achievements accomplished in the last twenty years, many practical and serious challenges are limiting the full deployment of this novel quantum technology in the current telecommunication infrastructures. In particular, the co-propagation of quantum signals and high-speed data traffic within the same optical fiber, is not completely resolved, due to the intrinsic noise caused by the high intensity of the classical signals. As a consequence, current co-propagation schemes limit the amount of classical optical power in order to reduce the overall link noise. However, this ad-hoc solution restrains the overall range of possibilities for a large-scale QKD deployment. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new method, based on up-conversion assisted receiver, for co-propagating classical light and QKD signals. In addition, we compare the performances of this scheme with an off-the-shelf quantum receiver, equipped with a standard InGaAs detector, over different lengths of an installed fiber link. Our proposal exhibits higher tolerance for noise in comparison to the standard receiver, thus enabling the distribution of secret keys in the condition of 4 dB-higher classical power.",

Both interferometric and intensity‐difference measurements can provide photon‐shot‐noise‐limited sensitivity, but further improvements in sensitivity with classical resources require either increased laser power that can induce unwanted heating and electronic perturbations or increased measurement times that can obscure out‐of‐equilibrium dynamics and slow experimental throughput. Proof‐of‐principle measurements have already demonstrated quantum enhanced spin noise measurements with a squeezed readout field that are likely to be critical to the nonperturbative characterization of spin excitations in quantum materials that emerge at low temperatures. Here, a truncated nonlinear interferometric readout for low‐temperature magneto‐optical Kerr effect and related magneto‐optical microscopies that is accessible with today's quantum optical resources is proposed. 10 sensitivity is achievable with optical power as small as 1 µW. As a result, measurements may be performed at temperatures as low as 83 mK in commercially available dilution refrigerators. This combination of high sensitivity and low operating temperature is impossible to achieve with any classical measurement.

Herein, a brief introduction to the field of phonon control is given with an emphasis on bulk phonons at high frequencies within crystalline solids. In cavity optomechanics, the photons and phonons can be confined by material boundaries, yielding large optomechanical coupling rates at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies, but the spurious heating is detrimental to robust operation. Although electromechanical techniques can be used to access long‐lived phonons in piezoelectric crystals, they are not suitable for the study of non‐piezoelectric crystals. The phase‐matched Brillouin interactions enable efficient optical access GHz frequency mechanical modes within macroscopic crystalline solids. Combining with the well‐established framework of cavity optomechanics, efficient optical control of BAWs can be obtained. For optical phonons, strong spontaneous Raman cooling and heating based on the interaction between excitons and phonons are considered. In addition, the application of optical phonons in quantum memory at room temperature is introduced. The review finishes with a discussion of the research direction for bulk optomechanical systems and exciton–phonon coupling systems in the future.",

The core step in the classical algorithm for performing ADPAAD is to construct an approximate representation of the subsequence, where the elements of each subsequence are divided into several subsections according to the amplitude domain, and then the average of the subsections is computed. It is computationally expensive when processing large‐scale sequences. In this paper, a quantum algorithm for ADPAAD is proposed, which can divide the subsequence elements and compute the average in parallel. The quantum algorithm can achieve polynomial speedups on the number of subsequences and the length of subsequences over its classical counterpart.",

We applied our technique to quantum process tomography for the characterization of several quantum channels. We demonstrate that a stable and reliable operation is achievable by training the network only with simulated data.

This study examines theoretically the coherent spin dynamics of a hetero‐spin system formed by a spin featuring a non‐zero crystal field and in proximity to a paramagnetic center . An analysis of the energy level structure of the dyad shows this system exhibits apair of levels separated by a magnetic‐field‐insensitive energy gap, which can be exploited to create long‐lived zero‐quantum coherences. It is found that these coherences are selectively sensitive to “local”—as opposed to “global”—magnetic field fluctuations, suggesting these spin dyads can serve as a nanoscale gradiometer for precision magnetometry. On the other hand, the distinct response of either spin species to electric or thermal stimuli allows one to implement alternative sensing protocols for magnetic‐noise‐free electrometry and thermometry.",

Although the Ising Hamiltonians for many NP hard problems have been obtained, a general method to obtain the Ising Hamiltonians for constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) has not yet been investigated. In this paper, a general method is introduced to obtain the Ising Hamiltonians for CCOPs and the Metropolis‐Hastings warm‐starting algorithm for QAOA is presented which can provably converge to the global optimal solutions. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by tackling the minimum weight vertex cover (MWVC) problem, the minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem, and the maximal independent set problem as examples. The Ising Hamiltonian for the MWVC problem is obtained first time by using this method. The advantages of the Metropolis‐Hastings warm‐starting algorithm presented here is numerically analyzed through solving 30 randomly generated MVC cases with 1‐depth QAOA.",

Here, a SW model including a homogeneous phase noise caused by SMFFs is developed, and then revealed that such phase noise induces decoherence of single‐excitation entanglement between two atomic ensembles in a repeater link. For verifying this conclusion, single‐excitation entanglement between two SWs in a cold atomic ensemble is experimentally prepared and observed entanglement decoherence induced by SMFFs. Limited by SMFFs, the evaluated lifetime of the single‐excitation entanglement over a repeater link is ≈135 ms, even if the link uses optical‐lattice atoms as nodes.

In contrast, reports on achieving ferromagnetism in topological insulators by introducing non‐magnetic elements are very scarce. The present article illustrates Au ion implantation as an alternative tool to study the structural and magnetic properties in the Bi 2 Se 3 nanocrystals grown by the chemical vapor deposition. The as‐grown pristine Bi 2 Se 3 exhibits triangular and hexagonal plate‐like morphology, which undergoes structural distortion with increased Au ions. The room temperature Raman spectra show defect‐induced phonon softening with ion fluence. The non‐magnetic Bi 2 Se 3 exhibit room temperature ferromagnetic hysteresis that originates from Bi vacancies which is verified from the density functional theory (DFT)calculations. The incorporation of Au ions initially decreases the magnetic moment up to the fluence 1 × 10 14 ions cm −2 and enhances at higher fluences due to the formation of Au nanoclusters. The experimental and DFT results suggest a competition between the Se “4p” states and Au “5d” states for the non‐monotonic behavior of magnetic properties. The present work on Au intercalation in Bi 2 Se 3 can pave the way to design artificial topological insulator devices for potential technological applications for future spintronics and quantum computations.",

Opt. 22 91), analytical expressions for four properties are obtained: average intensity, degree of polarization (DoP), orientation angle of polarization (OAoP), and ellipticity. The OAoP and ellipticity distributions of ELGSMV beams in relation to the topological charge l and order p are investigated. This is innovatively demonstrate that the OAoP and ellipticity distributions of the ELGSMV beam are the petal‐like shape, with the number of petals being twice as large as the corresponding topological charge. And, the positive or negative value of the topological charge affects the direction in which the petal rotates. In addition, the ELGSMV beam has a higher resistance to atmospheric turbulence than the general partially coherent vortex beam from the perspective of the DoP properties. These novel results may not only propose an effective method for recognizing the OAM mode of a partially coherent vortex beam, but also provide a theoretical basis for the selection of high‐quality beams in applications like quantum information and wireless optical communication.",

However, when constraints are involved, particularly multiple inequality constraints, incorporating them into the objective function poses challenges. In this paper, the authors present two novel approaches for solving problems with multiple inequality constraints on a quantum annealer and apply them to the set cover problem (SCP). The first approach uses the augmented Lagrangian method to represent the constraints, while the second approach employs a higher‐order binary optimization (HUBO) formulation. The experiments show that both approaches outperform the standard approach for solving the SCP on the D‐Wave Advantage quantum annealer. The HUBO formulation performs slightly better than the augmented Lagrangian method in solving the SCP, but its scalability in terms of embeddability in the quantum chip is worse. The results demonstrate that the proposed augmented Lagrangian and HUBO methods can successfully implement a large number of inequality constraints, making them applicable to a broad range of constrained problems beyond the SCP.",

One of the recent quantum key distribution protocols, the phase‐matching protocol, can have a quadratic key‐rate improvement. Its security was initially established using an abstract method known as symmetry‐protected privacy. In this study, this security is reevaluated under the more intuitive source‐replacement model, arriving at the same conclusions as the original proof. This model provides a fresh perspective on the protocol's security. As an application of this approach, a beam‐splitting attack is introduced.

To this end, a seemingly‐powerful classical computing model, called “stochastic ensemble machine (SEnM),” is considered. The SEnM runs with an ensemble consisting of finite copies of a single probabilistic machine, hence is as powerful as a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM). Then the hypothesis—that is, the SEnM can effectively simulate a general circuit model of QC—is tested by introducing an information‐theoretic inequality, named readout inequality. The inequality is satisfied by the SEnM and imposes a critical condition: if the hypothesis holds, the inequality should be satisfied by the probing model of QC. However, it is shown that the above hypothesis is not generally accepted with the inequality violation; namely, such a simulation necessarily fails, implying that PTM ⊆ QC.",

We demonstrate that quantum steerability of the state increases for a specific range of height h and then gradually approaches a finite value with further increasing height of the satellite's orbit. Comparing with the peak frequency parameter, the Gaussian steering changes more for different squeezing parameters, while the gravitational frequency effect leads to quantum steering asymmetry between the photon pairs.

We report a novel approach for an ultrafast generation of a field-free vector potential that is tunable in duration, sign, and magnitude, allowing to impart non-invasive, spatio-temporally controlled changes to the quantum nature of nanosystems. The method relies on triggering a steady-state toroidal moment in a donut-shaped nanostructure that serves as a vector-potential generator and quantum phase modulator. Irradiated by moderately intense, few cycle THz pulses with appropriately shaped polarization states, the nano donut is brought to a steady-state where a nearby object does not experience electric nor magnetic fields but feels the photo-generated vector potential. Designing the time structure of the driving THz pulses allows for launching picosecond trains of vector potentials which is the key for a contact-free optimal control of quantum coherent states. During the toroidal moment rise up time radiation is emitted which can be tuned in a very broad frequency band. We carry out full-fledged quantum dynamic simulations, and theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying principles and to endorse the feasibility, robustness, and versatility of the scheme. This research could trigger a new class of ultrafast quantum devices operated and switched in an energy-efficient, contact and field-free manner, enabling new techniques for use in quantum information, magnetic nanostructures and superconducting tunnel junctions as well as in toroidally ordered systems and multiferroics.",

Two quantum interference methods, namely photocurrent beat spectroscopy and phase‐locked pulses transient absorption spectroscopy, are recently developed to analyze ultrafast photocarrier generation processes. This review describes how these two techniques can be employed to identify electronic states contributing to photon‐to‐current conversion processes in solar cell materials. Two types of states are highlighted: (i) localized levels within the bandgaps of bulk crystals and thin films leading to photocarrier generation, and (ii) exciton complexes in nanocrystals whose ultrafast dynamics directly influence the efficiency of photoabsorption processes. Since quantum interference measurements provide quantum phase information that is not accessible by other conventional methods, they can also be utilized for advanced evaluation and optimization of optoelectronic materials and devices.",

Here we break this barrier to present a multichannel parallel ghost imaging system, by exploiting hyperentanglement where photon pairs are simultaneously entangled in polarization, color, and spatial mode. In the experiment, polarization and color entanglements provide 2× 2 independent channels via simultaneous polarization and color multiplexing, while an optical isolator with a delay line is constructed to ensure that spatial entanglement conveys the ghost image in parallel.

The method applies also to systems at finite temperature, which is important for quantum technologies and quantum thermodynamics related protocols. The importance of accounting for memory effects is discussed via comparison to results obtained by extending the quantum adiabatic criterion to finite temperatures: it is shown that this may produce false readings being quasi-Markovian by construction.

While a number of distinct conducting phases, including high temperature superconductivity, have been theoretically anticipated, a tendency toward fractionalized insulating charge‐density‐wave (CDW) states is instead found. In agreement with earlier work [Jiang, Devereaux, and Kivelson, Phys. Rev. Lett . 2017, 119 , 067002], results for the t ‐ J model reveal that, starting from a fully gapped QSL, light doping leads to CDW long‐range order with a pattern that depends on lattice geometry and doping concentration such that there is one doped‐hole per CDW unit cell, while the spin–spin correlations remain short‐ranged. Alternatively, this state can be viewed as a stripe crystal or Wigner crystal of spinless holons, rather than of doped holes. From here, by studying generalized versions of the t ‐ J model, these results are extended to light doping of other types of QSLs, including critical and chiral QSLs. These results suggest that doping these QSLs also leads to insulating states with long‐range CDW order. While the superconducting correlations are short‐ranged, they can be significantly enhanced by second‐neighbor electron hopping. The relevance of these numerical results to Kagome materials is also discussed.",

Environmentally induced decoherence for a particle sliding over a dielectric sheet can be decomposed into contributions of different signatures: one solely induced by the electromagnetic vacuum in the presence of the dielectric and another induced by motion. As the geometric phase (GP) has been proved to be a fruitful venue of investigation to infer features of the quantum systems, herein it is proposed to use the accumulated GP acquired by a particle as a QF sensor. Furthermore, an innovative experiment designed to track traces of QF by measuring the velocity dependence of corrections to the GP and coherence is proposed.

Next, to study what events can be specified by quantum methods, the concept of the condition space is introduced, which is found to be the dual space of the classical outcome space of bit strings. Like the classical outcome space generates the quantum state space, the condition space generates the quantum condition space being the central idea of this work. The quantum condition space permits the existence of entangled conditions having no classical equivalent. In addition, the quantum condition space is related to the quantum state space by a Fourier transform guaranteed by the Pontryagin duality, and therefore an entropic uncertainty principle can be defined. The quantum condition space offers a novel perspective of understanding quantum states with the duality picture. Furthermore, the quantum conditions have physical meanings and realizations of their own and thus may be studied for purposes beyond the original motivation of characterizing events for probability evaluation. Finally, the relation between the condition space and quantum circuits provides insights into how quantum states are collectively modified by quantum gates, which may lead to deeper understanding of the complexity of quantum circuits.",

They enable the understanding, demonstration, and modeling of numerous useful phenomena, such as high fidelity transfer of quantum states, creation and distribution of entanglement, and creation of resources for measurement-based quantum processing. In this paper, a more complex spin system, a 2D spin network (SN) engineered by applying suitable unitaries to two uncoupled spin chains, is studied. Considering only the single-excitation subspace of the SN, it is demonstrated that the system can be operated as a router, directing information through the SN. It is also shown that it can serve to generate maximally entangled states between two sites. Furthermore, it is illustrated that this SN system can be used as a sensor device able to determine an unknown phase applied to a system spin. A detailed modeling investigation of the effects of static disorder in the system shows that this system is robust against different types of disorder.",

Here a comparative study of efficient frequency mixing using various techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity such as counter‐diabatic driving and invariant‐based inverse engineering is presented. It is shown here that it is possible to perform sum frequency generation by properly designing the poling structure of a periodically poled crystal and the coupling between the input lights and the crystal. The required crystal length for frequency conversion significantly decreases beyond the adiabatic limit. This approach significantly improves the robustness of the process against the variation in temperature as well as the signal frequency. By introducing a single parameter control technique with constant coupling and combining with the inverse engineering, perturbation theory, and optimal control, it is shown that the phase mismatch can be further optimized with respect to the fluctuations of input wavelength and crystal temperature that results into a novel experimentally realizable mixing scheme.",

The latter are aimed for the implementation of quantum undo operations in quantum technology contexts as quantum computing and quantum communications. The last performed operation can be time‐reversed via the undo command so as to perfectly restore a condition in which any new operation, chosen by the external user, can be applied. By generalizing this concept, the undo command can also allow for the reversing of a quantum operation in a generic time instant of the past. Here, thanks to optimal time‐reversal routines, all these functionalities are experimentally implemented on the fivefold Hilbert space of a Bose–Einstein condensate of non‐interacting 87 Rb atoms in the ground state, realized with an atom chip. Each time‐reversal transformation is attained by designing an optimal modulated radio frequency field, achieving on average an accuracy of around 92% in any performed test. The experimental results are accompanied by a thermodynamic interpretation based on the Loschmidt echo. These findings are expected to promote the implementation of time‐reversal operations in a real scenario of gate‐based quantum computing with a more complex structure than the five‐level system considered here.",

The directional radiation and scattering of single‐photon sources play a crucial role in light manipulation and rely on electric and magnetic dipole moments. Although clever physical insights and designer intuition strategies have been successfully applied in the development of integrated sources, inverse strategies could enhance and maximize its performance. Recently, topology‐optimized couplers for on‐chip single‐photon sources are designed to efficiently couple a guided mode and an electric dipole. However, the superposition of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles can also be harnessed due to the additional degrees of freedom via their interference. Here, the authors have extended the strategy to couplers that enhance spin‐direction coupling of circularly polarized, Huygens, and Janus dipoles. The authors demonstrate that optimization not only increases the coupling to a desire mode but also enhances the electric and magnetic local density of states (LDOS) while maintaining the amplitude and phase relation between the orthogonal dipoles for unidirectional coupling. Currently, coupling efficiency and enhanced LDOS of up to 88%, 94%, and 93% and up to 9.4, 18.6, and 14.9 are obtained for these dipoles. The topology optimization improves the performances of 3D integrated photonic devices.",

In these contexts, conditions for minimizing dissipative effects are sought in order to obtain long living excitations that can be coherently manipulated. Organic and coordination materials may offer alternative options for their flexibility and low spin–orbit effects. Likewise, ferromagnetic nanostructures provide a versatile platform for hybrid architectures, yet downsizing affects the spin dynamics and needs to be controlled. Here, a systematic investigation on insulating CsNiCr(CN) 6 Prussian blue analogue, including isolated nanoparticles dispersed in polyvinylpyrrolidone, mutually interacting nanoparticles embedded in cetyltrimethylammonium, and bulk samples, is reported. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy is performed in a wide temperature range across the bulk ferromagnetic transition occurring at 90 K. This allows us to monitor key parameters through different types of nanostructured samples. It is found that the Gilbert damping parameter of 10 nm nanoparticles compares well (10 −3 ) with values reported for prototypical yttrium iron garnet Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 . Strong coupling with the microwave field of a microstrip resonator is then observed for bulk CsNiCr(CN) 6 as well as for interacting nanoparticles. These results clarify conditions for the coherent manipulation of collective spin degrees of freedom in nanostructured coordination materials.",

For intermediate distances, in the noninteracting case, two distinct peaks are observed. As a function of interaction strength, the two peaks merge into each other. The abundance and nature of these entangled regions is studied. The relation to resonances between single‐particle eigenstates is demonstrated.

Purcell enhancements are not only related to waveguide structures, but are also greatly affected by the position of single‐photon emitters in waveguides. Here, the insertion of a thin dielectric film with a controllable thickness between a dielectric strip and a metal surface to precisely position a single‐photon emitter in a dielectric‐load surface‐plasmon‐polariton (DLSPP) waveguide is proposed, and the Purcell enhancement is greatly enlarged. Simulations show that the vertical position of the single‐photon emitter above the metal surface is more important than its in‐plane position in the DLSPP waveguide for achieving enlarged Purcell enhancements. In the experiment, the vertical position of the single‐photon emitter in the modified DLSPP waveguide is controlled by evaporating a thin MgF 2 film, and the in‐plane position is controlled by combining aligned electron beam lithography and photoluminescence imaging. The Purcell factor in the emitter‐waveguide system is measured to be F p = 22.4, which is greater than those obtained using conventional DLSPP waveguides ( F p ≤ 6.0) in previous studies.",

When switching between the AFM and FM states, a large magnetoresistance ratio of 50% is obtained. Meanwhile, the on/off ratio for the magnetospin‐polarized thermal voltage associated with the magnonic spin current can be nearly infinite.

They consist of one dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic chains undulated by incommensurate structural modulations with unusually large atomic displacive waves, giving a mixed 1D/2D “real” magnetic topology. The magnetic ground state is antiferromagnetic (AFM) with k = [½ 0 0], leading to a nonmodulated collinear spin lattice despite the aperiodic atomic framework, and allows developing spin‐induced multiferroicity below T N . Severe arguments against the identified mechanisms for type‐II multiferroics, i.e., by inverse Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya, exchange striction and spin‐dependent p–d hybridizations, suggest an original scenario in which the atomic waves, the collinear magnetic structure, and magnetic dipole–dipole interactions may interact as crucial ingredients of the spin‐induced ferroelectric phase. Here, the specific role of the Co 2+ spin–orbit coupling in the magnetoelectric (ME) phase diagram is demonstrated by comparison with the novel Heisenberg BaFeP 2 O 7 isomorph, similarly structurally modulated. This compound shows a noncollinear modulated AFM ordering, while no ME coupling is detected in its case. Accordingly, both BaCoX 2 O 7 and BaFeP 2 O 7 also undergo metamagnetic transitions above 5–6 T promoted by the modulated distribution of spin exchanges, but the spin‐ flop progressive alignment of the spins in the noncollinear spin structure (Fe 2+ case) turns into an abrupt flip ‐like transition in the uniaxial spin structure (Co 2+ case).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Single photons and entangled photons lie at the heart of photonic quantum technologies, whose optimal performances are normally reached when the purity of the single or entangled photons is high. However, the multiphoton emission, dissipation, and decoherence in practical realizations always lead to the degradation of the single‐ and entangled‐ photon quality. The purification of single or entangled photons is thus valuable to restore the quantum states and enhance the performance of quantum technologies. The applications of wavepacket shaping, an emerging quantum optics tool to manipulate the single‐ and entangled‐ photon wavefunctions, to purify single and entangled photons are reviewed. In particular, by modulating the single photons emitted from optically excited room‐temperature quantum dots, it is shown that the fast‐decaying multiphoton emission can be eliminated to obtain a low value of g (2) (0) that is independent of the excitation power. It is also shown that the two‐photon interference and polarization entanglement of the non‐degenerate biphotons from spontaneous parametric down‐conversion can be restored after modulating the biphotons with a periodic function. The works have potential applications in long‐distance quantum communication and linear optical quantum computation.",

This phenomenon is considered an interesting instance of complementarity, which lies at the heart of quantum optics. Here, the first demonstration of induced coherence across two coupled interferometers based on spontaneous four‐wave mixing (SFWM) in two independent hot‐atomic‐vapor‐based entangled photon sources is reported. When both the pump and coupling lasers are split and interact with two warm 87 Rb atomic ensembles, single‐photon interference is observed between the two idler photons of the narrowband photon pairs, generated via SFWM from the two cascade‐type atomic systems. Furthermore, it is found that the phase memory effect arises from the phase of the bidirectional counter‐propagating pump and coupling lasers, respectively. This work takes an important step toward the transition to the era of quantum optics being driven by atomic ensembles from solid‐state systems.",

The algorithm's use is exemplified with the generation of schemes for the distribution of quantum states and the design of multi‐qubit gates. The algorithm is demonstrated to converge very rapidly, yielding unforeseeable designs of quantum devices that perform their required tasks with excellent fidelities. Given these promising results, practical scalability, and application versatility, the approach has the potential to become a powerful technique to aid the design and calibration of NISQ devices.",

    "abstract": "Spin-state transition, also known as spin crossover, plays a key role in diverse systems, including minerals and biological materials. In theory, the boundary range between the low- and high-spin states is expected to enrich the transition and give rise to unusual physical states. However, no compound that realizes a nearly degenerate critical range as the ground state without requiring special external conditions has yet been experimentally identified. This study reports that, by comprehensive measurements of macroscopic physical properties, X-ray diffractometry, and neutron spectroscopy, the Sc substitution in LaCoO$_3$ destabilizes its nonmagnetic low-spin state and generates an anomalous paramagnetic state accompanied by the enhancement of transport gap and magneto-lattice-expansion as well as the contraction of Co--O distance with the increase of electron site-transfer. These phenomena are not well described by the mixture of conventional low- and high-spin states, but by their quantum superposition occurring on the verge of a spin-state transition. The present study enables us to significantly accelerate the design of new advanced materials without requiring special equipment based on the concept of quantum spin-state criticality.",

By embedding the trijunction into a microwave cavity allows to study the intricate dynamics of the low-energy Majorana bound states (MBSs) coupled to the cavity electric field under a braiding operation. Extending a previous work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2019, 122, 236803), the full time evolution of the density matrix of the low-energy states, including various relaxation channels, is computed both in the adiabatic regime, as well as within the Floquet formalism in the case of periodic driving. It turns out that in the stationary state the observables of the system depend on both the parity of the ground state and on the non-Abelian Berry phase acquired during braiding. The average photon number and the second order photon coherence function $g^{(2)}(0)$ are explicitly evaluated and reveal the accumulated non-Abelian Berry phase during the braiding process.",

By considering simultaneous multicasts from a set of senders to a set of receivers, the corresponding rates for transmitting classical and quantum information through the networks are analyzed. More precisely, achievable rates (i.e., lower bounds) for classical communication are compared with upper bounds for quantum communication, quantifying the performance gap between the rates for networks connected by identity, depolarizing, and erasure channels. For each network considered, a range is observed over which the classical rate non‐trivially exceeds the quantum capacity. It is found that, by adding butterfly blocks in parallel, the difference between transmitted bits and qubits can be increased up to one extra bit per receiver in the case of perfect transmission (identity channels). The aim is to provide a quantitative analysis of those network configurations which are particularly disadvantageous for quantum networking, when compared to classical communication. By clarifying the performance of these “negative cases,” some guidance on how quantum networks should be built is also provided.",

The spatial coherence parameter ( d is the GC period and κ is the electron wave vector) is estimated as , suggesting that the electron coherence involves large clusters of GQD by spreading over 5–20 periods in the artificial crystal.

    "abstract": "Abstract Light trapping is a crucial mechanism for synchronization in optical communication. Especially on the level of single photons, control of the exact emission time is desirable. In this paper, a single‐photon buffering device composed of a quantum dot doped with a single Mn atom in a cavity is theoretically proposed. A method to detain a single cavity photon as an excitation of the dot is presented. The storage scheme is based on bright to dark exciton conversion performed with an off‐resonant external optical field and mediated via a spin‐flip with the magnetic ion. The induced Stark shift brings both exciton states to resonance and results in an excitation transfer to the optically inactive one. The stored photon can be read out on demand in the same manner by repopulating the bright state, which has a short lifetime. The results indicate the possibility to suspend a photon for almost two orders of magnitude longer than the lifetime of the bright exciton.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solids undergoing symmetry breaking phase transitions commonly exhibit domains of low symmetry phases with various sizes and morphological shapes. Usually, the shapes of these domains are not directly related to the nature of symmetry breaking. Here, an interesting example of a layered dichalcogenide with a triangular lattice is shown, in which symmetry breaking of electronic charge/orbital is accompanied by formation of striped domains and exotic surface states with peculiar spin textures. Using angle‐resolved photoemission spectromicroscopy, the mesoscopic striped domains in the layered IrTe 2 are observed across the first order phase transition at ≈280 K. Under further cooling down to 47 K, the striped domains evolve into trijunction domains with electronic anisotropy in three directions. Each domain harbors quasi 1D surface bands forming fragmented Fermi surfaces (Fermi arcs) with peculiar spin polarization revealed by spin‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The Fermi arc corresponds to an edge state of the 2D bulk electronic bands truncated at the surface, indicating an interesting interplay between the symmetry breaking, surface electronic structure, and the spin state.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent experimental developments have allowed physicists to freeze molecules' motion down to an ultracold temperature regime where quantum effects become profound. Furthermore, each molecule can be precisely prepared at chosen internal states and the mutual interactions between molecules are also highly tunable. As such, ultracold molecules have emerged as a powerful platform in multiple disciplines across physics and chemistry. Meanwhile, a grand challenge exists as to how losses of molecules depend on a quantum many‐body environment. In this article, the recent experimental and theoretical progress of exploring losses of ultracold molecules is reviewed. Since the conventional theoretical scheme of treating isolated pairs of molecules is no longer applicable to the quantum degenerate regime that has been reached in recent experiments, an alternative framework of universal relations between two‐body losses and many‐body correlations has been established. Regardless of microscopic parameters ranging from the temperature and the particle number to the interaction strength, these universal relations always hold. This approach unfolds a simple universality behind complex loss processes of many‐body systems and provides physicists and chemists with a new tool to explore ultracold molecules.",

Notable changes are found in the magnetotransport properties between the two different shaped samples. One is that the MR in ring‐shaped samples is three orders lower than that in unbended samples under the same sample environment. In addition, linear MR is observed above ≈20 T in ring‐shaped samples when the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the rings. Quantum oscillations are also observed as a function of the magnetic field when the magnetic field is applied parallel to rings, possibly due to the Altshuler–Aronov–Spivak effect or the inversion of the lowest Landau level beyond the quantum limit.

The substitution introduces electronic inhomogeneity with the Se 4p/S 3p valence band exhibiting strong position dependence. In contrast, the flat top valence band, which is a signature of the excitonic insulating phase, does not show any appreciable position dependence except the effect of surface corrugation.

Using a combination of first principles and Wannier‐based tight‐binding methods, this study investigates both the bulk and surface electronic structures of the compounds for varying compositions ( x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1), with a focus on their topological properties. By using chirality analysis, (111) surface electronic structure analysis, and surface Fermi arcs analysis, it is established that the TaP x As 1− x compounds exhibit topologically nontrivial behavior, characterized as Weyl semimetals (WSMs). The effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on the topological properties of the compounds is further studied. In the absence of SOC, the compounds exhibit linearly dispersive fourfold degenerate points in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) resembling Dirac semimetals. However, the introduction of SOC induces a phase transition to WSM states, with the number and position of Weyl points (WPs) varying depending on the composition of the alloy. For example, TaP has 12 WPs in the FBZ. The findings provide novel insights into the electronic properties of TaP x As 1− x compounds and their potential implications for the development of topological materials for various technological applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) steering and Bell nonlocality illustrate two different kinds of correlations predicted by quantum mechanics. They not only motivate the exploration of the foundation of quantum mechanics, but also serve as important resources for quantum‐information processing in the presence of untrusted measurement apparatuses. Herein, a method for characterizing the creation of EPR steering and Bell nonlocality is introduced for dynamical processes in experiments. It shows that the capability of an experimental process to create quantum correlations can be quantified and identified simply by preparing separable states as test inputs of the process and then performing local measurements on single qubits of the corresponding outputs. This finding enables the construction of objective benchmarks for the two‐qubit controlled operations used to perform universal quantum computation. It demonstrates this utility by examining the experimental capability of creating quantum correlations with the controlled‐phase operations on the IBM Quantum Experience and Amazon Braket Rigetti superconducting quantum computers. The results show that the method provides a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating the primitive operations of nonclassical correlation creation in noisy intermediate scale quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plasmonic antennas are widely used to achieve substantial emission rate enhancement. These antennas suffer from significant absorption losses that preclude the observation of Kerker conditions in such systems. The perfect balancing of the Mie‐scattering moments in an antenna at the generalized Kerker condition provides radiation directionality to its far‐field scattering pattern and zero absorption losses, a situation not achievable for a plasmonic system. Here, using both theoretical and computational approaches, the superposition of Mie‐scattering moments induced by coupling two individual silver (Ag) cylinders in a coupled‐dipolar plasmonic antenna is discussed. This results in the balancing of multipolar moments to a large extent with unidirectional scattering and hence the generalized Kerker condition in a plasmonic system. By placing a nanodiamond‐based single NV‐ center in the plasmonic gap‐cavity formed between the two Ag cylinders, &gt;300 times Purcell enhancement is achieved with improved emission directionality leading to 80% collection efficiency. The proposed coupled‐dipolar plasmonic antenna is well suited for generating bright single photon emissions with a GHz emission rate, which is helpful for quantum photonic applications.",

The optimized unit structure is coded and the coded metasurface is constructed. Different coding metasurface sequences are constructed based on 1‐bit, 2‐bit, and 3‐bit digital coding units. According to generalized Snell's law, the number of transmitted beams can be controlled. The authors introduce complex code addition theory to construct multifunctional beam control metasurface. Based on the far field scattering theory of metasurface, the addition theory of different sequences of transmission‐coded metasurface is analyzed. The addition operation of the superposition of two sets of symmetric double beams and two sets of ordinary double beams can be realized.

Spintronics, focused on electron transport phenomena dependent on spin, holds promise as an advanced technology. Nevertheless, most recent quantum technologies adopted by leading businesses and start‐ups rely heavily on others, and there is a race to increase the number of qubits to gain a computational advantage. Therefore, it is crucial to consider new classes of materials instead of the conventional ones. Developing high‐performance organic spintronics based on new classes of materials, namely, ionic liquids (ILs), liquid and soft crystals, and macroradicals, can support high‐speed and low‐power computing applications, offering higher spin‐relaxation times in the order of microsecond at room temperature. This perspective discusses the key challenges of the currently utilized inorganic semiconductors, small molecules, and π‐conjugated polymers. It also discusses how the new classes of organic spintronics can bridge these performance gaps.",

This study explores the quantum fluctuations of frequency combs and reveal the continuous‐variable quantum entanglement between different comb lines of the DKS states. The entanglement of DKS exhibits two distinct characteristics. For modes located at the spectral edge with a small number of excitations, different comb modes with multiple colors become entangled due to photon‐pair generation and coherent photon conversion stimulated by the FWM. Notably, a sudden disappearance of quantum entanglement in the center of the DKS spectrum is observed, which is attributed to the self‐locking phenomena in the FWM network. These findings demonstrate the prominent quantum nature of DKS, which is of fundamental significance in quantum optics and has the potential to be utilized in quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Superconducting resonators are widely used in many applications such as qubit readout for quantum computing, and kinetic inductance detectors. These resonators are susceptible to numerous loss and noise mechanisms, especially the dissipation due to two‐level systems (TLS) which become the dominant source of loss in the few‐photon and low temperature regime. In this study, capacitively‐coupled aluminum half‐wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators are investigated. Surprisingly, the loss of the resonators is observed to decrease with a lowering temperature at low excitation powers and temperatures below the TLS saturation. This behavior is attributed to the reduction of the TLS resonant response bandwidth with decreasing temperature and power to below the detuning between the TLS and the resonant photon frequency in a discrete ensemble of TLS. When response bandwidths of TLS are smaller than their detunings from the resonance, the resonant response and thus the loss is reduced. At higher excitation powers, the loss follows a logarithmic power dependence, consistent with predictions from the generalized tunneling model (GTM). A model combining the discrete TLS ensemble with the GTM is proposed and matches the temperature and power dependence of the measured internal loss of the resonator with reasonable parameters.",

In this paper, GI through a wind‐induced random environment under low‐light detection is experimentally and numerically investigated. The experiment is performed with a wind tunnel, and the imaging quality decreases with wind velocity and detection signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). The simulation model of GI under low‐light detection through this kind of environment is proposed, and simulation results match well with experiments. With the theoretical model, imaging results for the binary and grayscale object under supersonic wind region are discussed in detail, and the critical wind velocity under the influences of boundary‐layer thickness and object size are obtained.

Although DI test is a powerful tool in many quantum information tasks, it generally requires nonlocal settings. Fundamentally, the superposition property of quantum states, quantified by coherence measures, is a distinct feature to distinguish quantum mechanics from classical theories. In literature, witness and quantification of coherence with trusted devices have been well-studied. However, it remains open whether we can witness and quantify single party coherence with untrusted devices, as it is not clear whether the concept of DI tests exists without a nonlocal setting. In this work, we study DI witness and quantification of coherence with untrusted devices. First, we prove a no-go theorem for a fully DI scenario, as well as a semi DI scenario employing a joint measurement with trusted ancillary states. We then propose a general prepare-and-measure semi DI scheme for witnessing and quantifying the amount of coherence. We show how to quantify the relative entropy and the $l_1$ norm of single party coherence with analytical and numerical methods. As coherence is a fundamental resource for tasks such as quantum random number generation and quantum key distribution, we expect our result may shed light on designing new semi DI quantum cryptographic schemes.",

The suppressed cavity reflectance signal of the QCA process may experimentally provide the evidence for the different measurement mechanism of the cavity from external electrometers like quantum point contact. Furthermore, on careful tuning of multiple energy level differences of the TQD to match the cavity photon frequency, four tunneling processes assisted by the absorption of the cavity photons occur simultaneously, contributing to “photon‐assisted” quadruple point. Consequently, these two specific phenomena are found to be closely dependent on the relationship between the various Coulomb energy in TQD and the cavity photon energy. The results are consistent with the theoretical model presented and imply that this hybrid system has the potential for investigating exotic many‐body effects and matter–light interaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a widespread view that the human brain is so complex that it cannot be efficiently simulated by universal Turing machines, let alone ordinary classical computers. During the last decades the question has therefore been raised whether it is needed to consider quantum effects to explain the imagined cognitive power of a conscious mind. Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that quantum‐enhanced cognition and intelligence are very unlikely to be found in biological brains. Quantum effects may certainly influence signaling pathways at the molecular level in the brain network, like ion ports, synapses, sensors, and enzymes. This might evidently influence the functionality of some nodes and perhaps even the overall intelligence of the brain network, but hardly give it any dramatically enhanced functionality. The conclusion is that biological quantum networks can only approximately solve small instances of nonpolynomial (NP)‐hard problems. On the other hand, artificial intelligence and machine learning implemented in complex dynamical systems based on genuine quantum networks can certainly be expected to show enhanced performance and quantum advantage compared with classical networks. Nevertheless, even quantum networks can only be expected to solve NP‐hard problems approximately. In the end it is a question of precision—Nature is approximate.",

To this extent a reactive model coordinate is used which captures the essential features of an atomistic and dynamic solvent environment during a picosecond control scenario. The time‐resolved influence of a molecular environment is revealed to fluctuate on a time‐scale of few hundred femtoseconds. Laser pulse optimizations are performed for different control scenarios, giving general experimental guidelines on how to find a reasonable tradeoff between pulse complexity and population yield. Few‐cycle flexible terahertz pulses are found to be capable of handling the complexities which are introduced by a fluctuating environment to the quantum properties of the molecular system. Besides the practical limitations in pulse generation and shaping, there seem to be no theoretical limits to controlling the investigated process with its environmental fluctuations. As the chosen model system involves a methyl group transfer and carbon–carbon formation, it stands representative for other commonly performed synthetic schemes in modern organic and pharmaceutical chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The coordination between distance and the secure key rate is one of the main challenges in the practical application of quantum key distribution (QKD). Mode‐pairing quantum key distribution is one of the schemes that can surpass the secret key capacity for repeaterless QKD. However, the protocol utilizes phase to encode the information, which leads to the problem of active stabilization in the interferometer. In this paper, a reference‐frame‐independent mode‐pairing quantum key distribution (RFI‐MP‐QKD) is proposed as an effective scheme to solve this problem. Moreover, the performance of the RFI‐MP‐QKD protocol is improved by applying the Advantage Distillation (AD) method in data post‐processing, which separates the highly correlated raw key bits from the weakly correlated information. The simulation results show that the secure key rate of RFI‐MP‐QKD has almost no degradation for reference frame deviation angles of . Compared to RFI‐MP‐QKD without AD method, the AD method decreases the quantum bit error rate from 0.04 to 0.012 and increases the maximum transmission distance from 406 to 450 km. The scheme proposed is expected to facilitate the practical implementation of RFI‐MP‐QKD, especially in cases of concerning reference frame alignment and high channel loss.",

The research approach involving evolution on dynamics provides a framework to investigate simultaneous multiparameter estimation within graph states. For single‐parameter estimation, it is observed that the precision limit exceeds the Heisenberg limit in higher‐dimensional spin systems. For multiparameter estimation, two scenarios are considered: one with commutative Hamiltonian operators and another with non‐commutative Hamiltonian operators. The results demonstrate that the global estimation precision exceeds the local estimation precision. Under the conditions of parameter limit, the precision of parameter estimation for simultaneously estimating each parameter is equal to that of single‐parameter estimation. Furthermore, a precision‐enhancement scheme has been identified that depends on the dynamics of . The smaller the value of in the dynamic evolution, the higher the precision of the parameter estimation. Finally, it is demonstrated that graph states serve as optimal states in quantum metrology. A set of optimal measurement bases is also identified, and it is illustrated that the precision limit of multiparameter estimation can attain the quantum Cramér‐Rao bound.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The nitrogen−vacancy (NV) center in diamond gains its versatility when negatively charged (NV − ) but is mediocre when neutrally charged. Particularly, the charge states of NV centers are convertible under optical pumping and during the dark intervals, whose dynamics are mixed with the NV − s’ spin polarizations and relaxations, making them difficult to detect. Here, a microwave‐pulses‐assisted charge state dynamics (CSD) measurement method of NV centers in the dark time (DT) is proposed. The microwave pulses are designed to manipulate the populations of the NV − s’ ground state spin triplets (qutrit) to the equilibrium state before the DT. Thus, the longitudinal relaxations of the qutrit are balanced, and pure CSD can be detected. Interestingly, in an annealed bulk diamond, not only the traditional tunneling‐induced fast exponential CSD are observed, but also a slow and long‐term recharging process, which is probably attributed to the exchanging of the electrons between NV centers and the high‐energy‐level charge traps such as vacancy clusters. Furthermore, results demonstrate a 40% increase in NV − s’ contrast by properly extending the recharging DT. These results are significant for the in‐depth study of the NV centers’ CSD and can improve the sensing abilities of the NV − ensemble.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, the topological edge waveguide and corner state cavity have attracted the extensive attention of researchers due to their excellent characteristics with robustness to defects and localization to cavity in manipulating signal transmission, respectively. Herein, topologically trivial and nontrivial photonic crystals (PCs) are realized by shrinking and expanding the honeycomb lattice, and achieve gapped and continuous edge states in the constructed topological edge waveguides with zig‐zag and armchair interfaces by combining two kinds of PCs with different topologies, respectively. In addition, corner states are realized by constructing box‐shaped structure with zig‐zag interfaces, and verify that the corner states appearing around the obtuse‐angle corners are topologically protected to introduced defects in the structure. Moreover, a waveguide‐cavity coupling system based on an armchair waveguide and a rhomboid cavity is proposed, which can realize multifunction of the signal delay and filtering at specific frequencies. Furthermore, a coupling system consisting of two waveguide and a cavity is constructed to implement beam splitting and filtering, and the stability of the system is greatly improved compared with the traditional optical devices because of the topological property. This work presents a novel approach for the design of micro‐nano integrated photonic devices such as filters, storages, and splitters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An extended Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model consisting of an SSH chain with an embedded quantum ring (QR) is investigated. In the case of two SSH chains with a symmetric distribution with respect to QR, by calculating the real‐space winding number and energy spectrum, the hopping amplitude‐induced topological phase is discovered. The probability distributions of gap states and the relationship between energy and magnetic flux prove the existence of the Aharonov–Bohm effect in the QR. Moreover, in the case of asymmetric distribution, the model possesses a zero‐energy mode within the energy gap, and it is found that it can realize quantum state transfer. By adjusting the connection site between the right SSH chain and QR, the direction of the output port can be flexibly engineered. Furthermore, it is shown that high‐fidelity quantum state transfer can still be achieved with the increasing of the system size. The tunable quantum state transfer based on the zero‐energy mode can be equivalent to a topological tunable directional switch with properties of non‐directional transfer. This work provides an approach for studying topological phase transition and tunable topological devices in an SSH chain with an embedded QR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nondeterministic measurement‐based techniques are efficient in reshaping the population distribution of a quantum system but suffer from a limited success probability of holding the system in the target state. To save the experimental cost, a two‐step protocol is proposed to cool a resonator down to the ground state with a near‐unit probability by exploiting the state‐engineering mechanisms of both conditional and unconditional measurements on an ancillary qubit. In the first step, the unconditional measurements on the ancillary qubit are applied to reshape the target resonator from a thermal state to a reserved Fock state. The measurement sequence can be efficiently optimized by reinforcement learning for maximum fidelity. In the second step, the population on the reserved state can be faithfully transferred in a stepwise way to the resonator's ground state with a near‐unit fidelity by the conditional measurements on the qubit. Properly designing the projection operator and the measurement interval enables the Kraus operator to act as a lowering operator for neighboring Fock states. Through dozens of measurements in all, the initial thermal average population of the resonator can be reduced by five orders in magnitude with a success probability of over 95%.",

Here, the observation of coupling between the first order magnon mode in a metallic thin film with a cavity photon mode is reported. An electromagnetic perturbation theory that takes account of perpendicular standing spin waves and their respective dissipation is utilized to estimate the coupling strength. The metallic thin film exhibits notably lower dissipation for the higher‐order magnon mode, which is not observed in a thin film magnetic insulator. As such, and given that metallic Kittel magnons typically exhibit lower coherence times than their insulator counterparts, the excitation and coupling to specific higher order modes could lengthen these times compared to previous observations, which may be useful for future integration into quantum devices.",

The third sample is an electron‐irradiated type Ib diamond with a much higher intrinsic defect concentration. For all samples, spatially resolved photo‐current maps as well as laser power and bias voltage‐dependent measurements are recorded. Furthermore, photo‐currents are successfully recorded without an applied bias voltage. Finally, the technique is used to perform continuous wave photoelectric detection of magnetic resonances (PDMR) using NV centers.

Analytical solutions of the correlator equation and numerical simulations of the master equation reveal that modulated mechanical dissipation plays a crucial role in achieving strong single‐photon blockade. In contrast to conventional cavity optomechanical systems, a second‐order correlation function of can be achieved with weak single‐photon optomechanical coupling. By combining unconventional and conventional antibunching, the hybrid system achieves the convergence of maximal photon population, two‐photon interference, and suppression of higher‐order correlations. Additionally, the influence of the thermal noise on photon blockade is investigated, demonstrating greater robustness of the second‐order correlation under weaker phonon‐spin coupling.",

Therefore, this study proposes a Gaussian error sampler that employs the intrinsic Gaussian properties of nanometer‐scale semiconductor devices. The proposed Gaussian error sampler significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. This work comprehensively evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed device by conducting statistical normality tests and generating quantile–quantile plots.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a dynamic temperature compensation method is presented to stabilize the wavelength of the entangled biphoton source, which is generated on spontaneous parametric down‐conversion from a magnesium oxide doped periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. Utilizing the dispersive Fourier transformation technique, the photon wavelength variation is monitored in case of conventional static temperature control, revealing a long‐term wavelength drift up to 556.8 pm over a 14‐h measurement period. A Hong‐Ou‐Mandel (HOM) interferometer is constructed to assess the impact on quantum applications, showing a decrease in visibility from 95.5% to 69.4%. To address this issue, a digital proportional‐integral‐differential algorithm is implemented to dynamically compensate the working temperature variation of the waveguide, thereby instantly stabilizing the wavelength to a peak‐to‐peak fluctuation of +138.05 pm/‐127.61 pm with the standard deviation being 30.49 pm. The wavelength stability shows more than a hundredfold enhancement in terms of Allan deviation, reaching at an averaging time of 10000 s. With the dynamic control in operation, the HOM interference visibility turns to stable at 96.1% ± 0.6%. The method provides a simple and accessible solution for precisely controlling and stabilizing the wavelength of entangled biphotons, thus improving performance in various quantum information processing applications.",

First, a differentiable Hartley feature map parameterized by real‐valued argument that enables quantum models suitable for solving stochastic differential equations and regression problems is designed. Unlike the naturally complex Fourier encoding, the proposed Hartley feature map circuit leads to quantum states with real‐valued amplitudes, introducing an inductive bias and natural regularization. Next, a quantum Hartley transform circuit is proposed as a map between computational and Hartley basis. The developed paradigm is applied to generative modeling from solutions of stochastic differential equations, and utilize the quantum Hartley transform for fine sampling from parameterized distributions through an extended register. Finally, the capability of multivariate quantum generative modeling is demonstrated for both correlated and uncorrelated distributions. As a result, the developed quantum Hartley‐based generative models (QHGMs) offer a distinct quantum approach to generative AI at increasing scale.",

With properly designed Hamiltonians, the desired interactions are realized directly within the Schrödinger picture rather than relying on the interaction picture. This design confers two advantages. One is that the system's evolution remains continuously protected by the noise‐mitigation strategies at every stage, eliminating the need to revert to the Schrödinger picture. The other one is that the dynamical decoupling technique effectively averages out small residual free terms in the system's Hamiltonian, thus reducing the stringent requirements for precise control of system parameters to avoid errors. Furthermore, numerical results are presented to support our protocol by finding gate fidelities in the absence (presence) of noises or errors, without or with dynamical decoupling technique.",

An experimentally implementable model is considered to perform three different non‐Gaussian operations, namely photon subtraction (PS), photon addition (PA), and photon catalysis (PC) on a single‐mode squeezed vacuum (SSV) state. The findings reveal that all non‐Gaussian operations except one PC operation provide an advantage in either of the measurement schemes. This result is further supported by the analysis of the quantum Cramér–Rao bound. When accounting for the success probability of non‐Gaussian operations, two‐PC and four‐PA emerges as the most optimal operations in difference‐intensity and parity detection‐based MZI, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding squeezing and transmissivity parameters that yields the best performance are identified, making the study relevant for experimentalists. Furthermore, a general expression for the moment‐generating function is derived, which is useful in exploring other detection schemes such as homodyne detection and quadratic homodyne detection.",

In contrast to previous efforts, these challenges are successfully addressed by integrating a high‐power laser, a lock‐in amplifier, and a digitally‐modulated microwave source.

Then, utilizing ciphertext, a periodic function is constructed with a periodic value equal to the key value. MAC is calculated from messages and the associated data in the second scenario. Considering the impact of the associated data on the periodicity of the function, the messages are treated as a constant and further construct two periodic functions to recover the secret parameter and the key. For Prøst‐OTR, by constructing two periodic functions using two tags with different numbers of message blocks, the secret parameter can be recovered, and then the key can be recovered using Simon's algorithm. Compared to the classical attacks, the quantum‐based methods only require quantum queries (where is the message block size), resulting in an exponential speed acceleration and the success probability of the method is close to 1. These methods also show a lower query complexity than the state‐of‐the‐art quantum methods.",

Remote implementation of quantum operation (RIO) using a hyperentangled state has attracted much attention for its critical role in many quantum applications. In this study, a protocol for the remote implementation of particular subsets of operations exploiting a pair of photons hyperentangled in their polarization and time‐bin degrees of freedom (DOFs) is presented. The core of this scheme is to construct polarization and time‐bin parity‐check quantum nondemolition detectors (QNDs), which mainly rely on the effective cross‐Kerr nonlinear interaction and X homodyne measurements. The efficiency of the scheme is calculated in terms of bits of transmission and consumption. Compared with the RIO using the polarization‐spatial‐mode hyperentangled state, the present scheme saves resources since there is no requirement for two paths for each photon. Further, given some applicable experimental parameters, the fidelity due to the effect of decoherence in the circuits is analyzed, and the result demonstrates a high fidelity in the presence of photon dissipation. Since the time‐bin DOF is more robust over a channel, especially from space to earth, this RIO protocol presents a promising approach for building a global quantum‐communication network.",

Based on the existence of invariant subspaces during the polariton thermalization, a new way to enhance the measurement precision of low temperature is proposed and the Landau bound is obtained to avoid that the measurement uncertainty of the temperature diverges as the temperature approaches zero. The measurement precision of low temperature increases significantly with the number of polariton states. In order to resist the dissipation, the incoherent pumping is necessary for obtaining the information of the temperature encoded in the steady state. It should be noted that too strong incoherent pumping is wasteful due to that the quantum Fisher information of the temperature becomes less and less dependent on the total number of the polaritons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fault‐tolerant quantum computing based on surface codes has emerged as a popular route to large‐scale quantum computers capable of accurate computation even in the presence of noise. Its popularity is, in part, because the fault‐tolerance or accuracy threshold for surface codes is believed to be less stringent than competing schemes. This threshold is the noise level below which computational accuracy can be increased by increasing physical resources for noise removal, and is an important engineering target for realizing quantum devices. The current conclusions about surface code thresholds are, however, drawn largely from studies of probabilistic noise. While probabilistic noise is a natural assumption, current devices experience noise beyond such a model, raising the question of whether conventional statements about the thresholds apply. This work attempts to extend past proof techniques to derive the fault‐tolerance threshold for surface codes subjected to general noise with no particular structure. Surprisingly, no nontrivial threshold is found, i.e., there is no guarantee the surface code prescription works for general noise. While this is not a proof that the scheme fails, it appears that current proof techniques are likely unable to provide an answer. A genuinely new idea is needed to reaffirm the feasibility of surface code quantum computing.",

The goal of this paper is to characterize general multipartite entangled states according to shallow quantum circuits. It is first proved that any genuinely multipartite entanglement on finite‐dimensional spaces can be generated by using 2‐layer shallow quantum circuit consisting of two biseparable quantum channels, which has the smallest nontrivial circuit depth in the shallow quantum circuit model. Further, a semi‐device‐independent entanglement model depending on the local connection ability in the second layer of quantum circuits is proposed. This implies a complete hierarchy of distinguishing genuinely multipartite entangled states. It shows a completely different multipartite nonlocality from the quantum network entanglement. These results show new insights for the multipartite entanglement, quantum network, and measurement‐based quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electrically controllable quantum‐dot molecules (QDMs) are a promising platform for deterministic entanglement generation and, as such, a resource for quantum‐repeater networks. A microscopic open‐quantum‐systems approach based on a time‐dependent Bloch–Redfield equation is developed to model the generation of entangled spin states with high fidelity. The state preparation is a crucial step in a protocol for deterministic entangled‐photon‐pair generation that is proposed for quantum repeater applications. The theory takes into account the quantum‐dot molecules' electronic properties that are controlled by time‐dependent electric fields as well as dissipation due to electron–phonon interaction. The transition between adiabatic and non‐adiabatic regimes is quantified, which provides insights into the dynamics of adiabatic control of QDM charge states in the presence of dissipative processes. From this, the maximum speed of entangled‐state preparation is inferred under different experimental conditions, which serves as a first step toward simulation of attainable entangled photon‐pair generation rates. The developed formalism opens the possibility for device‐realistic descriptions of repeater protocol implementations.",

The Thouless energy, representing the energy scale at which the universal chaotic behavior in the energy spectrum ceases, can be determined from the spectrum itself. When simulating the SYK model on classical or quantum computers, it is advantageous to minimize the number of terms in the Hamiltonian by randomly pruning the couplings. In this paper, it is demonstrated that even with a significant pruning, eliminating a large number of couplings, the chaotic behavior persists up to short time scales. This is true even when only a fraction of the original couplings in the fully connected SYK model, specifically , is retained. Here, represents the number of sites, and . The properties of the long‐range energy scales, corresponding to short time scales, are verified through numerical singular value decomposition (SVD) and level number variance calculations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Multipartite quantum entanglement plays a vital role in both fundamental science and quantum applications. The cascaded four‐wave mixing (FWM) process is an effective method to prepare multipartite entanglement, however, the physical nature of entanglement based on different cascading paths, i.e., simultaneous cascaded FWM (SC‐FWM) and ordinal cascaded FWM (OC‐FWM), has not yet been conclusively determined. In this article, tunable continuous‐variable (CV) triple‐mode entanglement is proposed to be generated by using both the SC‐FWM and OC‐FWM schemes. The simulation results reveal that the absorption/dispersion properties of the two nonlinear processes can be efficiently tuned by varying the optical parameters (i.e., the photon detuning and the nonlinear susceptibility), resulting in triple‐mode CV entanglement with tunable properties. Compared with the OC‐FWM scheme, the SC‐FWM scheme has a broader entanglement bandwidth and a higher degree of entanglement, where the tripartite entanglement region is 4.38% larger than that of the OC‐FWM scheme. Furthermore, these results indicate that the SC‐FWM scheme has a more compact and stable mode structure with better entanglement performance. Such tunable optical triple‐mode entanglement may find applications in specific quantum communication protocols and pave the way for implementing and manipulating multichannel quantum networks.",

Standard distance functions, e.g., the Bures length, are not fully adequate for such a task. Weighted distances are instead the appropriate information measures to quantify the distinguishability of multipartite states. Here, the previously introduced weighted Bures length and the newly defined weighted Hilbert‐Schmidt distance are employed to quantify how much single‐qubit Pauli errors alter cluster states. For both types of weighted distances, it is found that different errors of the same dimension change cluster states in a different way, i.e., their detectability is in general different. Indeed, they transform an ideal cluster state into a state whose weighted distances from the input depends on the specific chosen Pauli rotation, as well as the position of the affected qubit in the graph related to the cluster state. As these features are undetected by using standard distances, the study proves the usefulness of weighted distances to monitor key but elusive properties of many‐body quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The discovery of the interface‐enhanced superconductivity in the single‐layer film of FeSe epitaxially grown on SrTiO 3 substrates has triggered a flurry of activity in the field of superconductivity. It raised the hope to find more conventional high transition temperature (T c ) superconductors that are purely driven by the electron‐phonon interaction at ambient pressure. Here the epitaxial growth of the Pb nano‐sized islands on SrTiO 3 (001) substrates with the island volumes ranging from 286 to 4945 nm 3 is reported by molecular beam epitaxy, followed by systematic scanning tunneling microscopic/spectroscopic (STM/S) investigation. The observed STS gap for the nanoscale islands highly dependent on the volumes of nano‐sized islands, can be divided into three regions. By performing a detailed spectroscopic investigation, it is founded that superconductivity in the volume above 3700 nm 3 (Region I) has a zero temperature energy gap (Δ(0)) and T c of 6.8 meV and 9.8 K obtained by BCS fitting, showing the largely‐enhanced Δ and slightly‐increased T c by comparing to the bulk Pb (1.4 meV and 7.2 K). As the volume in the range from 1300 to 3700 nm 3 (Region II), a large Coulomb gap induced by electron correlation emerged and shows a volume‐dependent behavior, suggesting the reduced size can enhance electron correlation in Pb islands. As the volume decreases down to Region III, enhanced electron correlation and Coulomb gap become more dominant and superconductivity is totally suppressed. The experiment reveals that an electron‐electron interaction in nano‐sized Pb islands can be significantly enhanced by reducing the island sizes and suppresses the superconductivity, thus demonstrates a competition between superconductivity and electron correlation as the volume varies.",

Recently, several quantum machine learning algorithms that use quantum kernels as a measure of similarities between data have emerged to perform binary classification on datasets encoded as quantum states. The potential advantages of quantum kernels arise from the ability of quantum computers to construct kernels that are more effective than their classical counterparts in capturing patterns in data or computing kernels more efficiently. However, existing quantum kernel‐based classification algorithms do not harness the capability of having data samples in quantum superposition for additional enhancements. This work demonstrates how such capability can be leveraged in quantum kernelized binary classifiers (QKCs) through Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) for quadratic speed‐up. Additionally, new quantum circuits are proposed for the QKCs in which the number of qubits is reduced by one, and the circuit depth is reduced linearly with respect to the number of sample data. The quadratic speed‐up over previous methods is verified through numerical simulations on the Iris dataset.",

The orthogonality of magnetic field coils is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of atomic magnetometers. The theoretical principles are derived to establish a measurement method for the non‐orthogonal angles. The proposed method requires only one single beam of light to perform in situ measurements of non‐orthogonal angles in the YZ and XZ directions. The experimental results demonstrate that the angle between the Y and Z coils is 89.3001 ± 0.0045°, a value that remains stable despite variations in experimental parameters such as temperature and light power, thereby confirming the robustness of the method. Additionally, the measured gyromagnetic ratio is 6.9963 ± 0.0005 Hz nT −1 , which closely matches the theoretical value of 6.9958 Hz nT −1 , further validating the method's accuracy. The proposed method provides a more straightforward approach and has significant potential for widespread application across various atomic magnetometers, especially in miniaturized configurations. Furthermore, this method may be extended to the field of atomic gyroscopes.",

To guarantee the security of generated random numbers, accurate conditional min‐entropy estimation methods that are compatible with imperfect factors are also developed.

In this paper, a single heterogeneous quantum dot distributed feedback (DFB) laser emitting 4 wavelengths using the combination‐grating technology is designed. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first heterogeneously integrated quantum dot DFB laser that lases stable multi‐wavelength in a single cavity. When the etching depth, etching width, and total length of gratings are 100 , 550 nm, and 1 000 µm, respectively, 4‐wavelength with 1297.01 , 1303.38 , 1309.74 , and 1316.11 nm are obtained by varying the grating period from 196 to 199 nm with the spacing of 1 nm. Compared to the conventional DFB laser arrays, the DFB laser units are significantly reduced by 3/4 while maintaining the same number of output wavelengths. Additionally, by optimizing the λ/4 phase‐shift position and the duty cycle of gratings, the output power at the front‐end of the 4‐wavelength laser is significantly improved. Specifically, the ratio of the output power from the front‐end and rear‐end of the laser increases from the conventional 1.00 to 2.51.

    "abstract": "Abstract Inferring a quantum system from incomplete information is a common problem in many aspects of quantum information science and applications, where the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) plays an important role. The quantum state compatibility problem asks whether there exists a density matrix compatible with some given measurement results. Such a compatibility problem can be naturally formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP), which searches directly for the existence of a . However, for large system dimensions, it is hard to represent directly, since it requires too many parameters. In this work, MaxEnt is applied to solve various quantum state compatibility problems, including the quantum marginal problem. An immediate advantage of the MaxEnt method is that it only needs to represent via a relatively small number of parameters, which is exactly the number of the operators measured. Furthermore, in case of incompatible measurement results, the method will further return a witness that is a supporting hyperplane of the compatible set. The method has a clear geometric meaning and can be computed effectively with hybrid quantum‐classical algorithms.",

This is followed by a detailed scan in the key rate calculation phase, streamlining data collection to fit machine learning timelines effectively. Several machine learning models are assessed—Generalized Linear Models (GLM), k‐Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—with a focus on predictive accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. RF and MLP were particularly noteworthy for their superior accuracy and robustness, respectively.

Whenever the difference between the driving frequencies matches the associated mechanical frequency, the photon and phonon populations are found to achieve steady‐state coherent oscillations, demonstrating a dual lasing phenomenon. Such drive–tone resonance condition can synchronize the phases of the photon and phonon fields, which facilitates a robust simultaneous lasing. Here, analytical insights into the joint amplification of the optical and mechanical modes are provided, and further confirm the dual lasing phenomenon by numerically calculating the relevant correlation functions and the power spectrum. This setup, consisting of a single optomechanical cavity, is simpler than previous realizations of dual lasing and provides a clean understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This work thus paves the way for the development of novel strategies for the optimisation of optomechanical interactions through tailored driving schemes.",

In 3D systems, however, phase‐slip events are generally considered to be insignificant. Here, details on the observation of a reentrant resistive state in 3D superconducting diamond nanowires (DNWs) are reported. This exotic resistive state alters the trend of the superconducting transition with an abrupt change of the temperature and magnetic‐field coefficients of resistivity and the current coefficient of voltage. This reentrant resistive state is interpreted as being a result of quantum phase slips in the bamboo‐like DNWs consisting of multiple sequential grain‐boundary‐grain junctions. The results provide the first evidence that quantum phase slips can also play a crucial role in determining the electrical transport properties of 3D superconducting nanowires.",

In this study, the magneto‐transport properties are investigated to provide evidence of the existence of interphase coupling in a magnetic mixed‐phase system, specifically, Ni‐doped FeRh thin films. The rotation of the external magnetic field induces an emergent promotion effect of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)–ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition, which can be attributed to the modification of the magnetic free energy by interphase magnetic coupling across the AFM–FM phase boundary. The results shed light on the availability of an extra degree of freedom for manipulating the physical properties of material systems with mixed magnetic phases and help to further exploit their potential applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High‐fidelity quantum state transfer, lying in the heart of the scalable quantum network, requires the frequency linkage among different quantum elements. Here, a protocol of quantum state transfer with seamless frequency‐connection between the solid spin and phonon as well as between arbitrary frequency and telecom photons through the diamond optomechanical cavity is proposed. When the diamond optomechanical cavity acts as a quantum node of the network, within each node, the spin state can map to the phonon state with arbitrary frequency via the sideband transition between spins and phonons, and simultaneously such phonon state can convert to photon state without any frequency selection through optomechanical interaction. Furthermore, the communication among quantum nodes is implemented by the evanescent field of nanofiber. The scheme not only enables universal scalable quantum networks for using robust quantum spins, but also offers a paradigm of the building block for optical quantum communications.",

Here, we provide a theoretical framework to implement universal geometric quantum gates in this system. We find that, while the detuning noise can be suppressed by operating near its corresponding sweet spot, the tunneling noise, on the other hand, is amplified and becomes the dominant source of error for single-qubit gates, a fact previously insufficiently appreciated. We demonstrate, through numerical simulation, that the geometric gates outperform the dynamical gates across a wide range of tunneling noise levels, making them particularly suitable to be implemented in conjunction with microwave driving. To obtain a nontrivial two-qubit gate, we introduce a hybrid system with charge qubits coupled by a superconducting resonator. When each charge qubit is in resonance with the resonator, it is possible to construct an entangling geometric gate with fidelity higher than that of the dynamical gate for experimentally relevant noise levels. Therefore, our results suggest that geometric quantum gates are powerful tools to achieve high-fidelity manipulation for the charge qubit.",

However, the accuracy and trainability of the current VQE algorithm are significantly influenced due to the barren plateau (BP), the non‐negligible gate error and limited coherence time in NISQ devices. To tackle these issues, a gradient‐cost multiobjective alternate framework with variable ansatz is proposed. A theoretical framework is first proposed for VQE with variable ansatz (VA‐VQE) via alternately solving a multiobjective optimization problem defined by cost function values and gradient magnitudes and the original VQE problem. Then, a novel implementation method based on the double ε‐greedy strategy with the candidate tree and modified multiobjective genetic algorithm is proposed. As a result, the local optima are avoided both in ansatz and parameter perspectives, the BP phenomenon is alleviated, and the stability of output ansatz is enhanced. The experimental results indicate that this framework shows considerably average improvement of the error and stability by 59.6% and 78.8% compared with the state‐of‐the‐art cost‐criterion‐based VA‐VQE implementation, and 54.1% and 73.5% compared with the gradient‐criterion‐based counterpart, respectively, with lower quantum costs.",

The periodically driven systems, where different spins (or sublattices) are engaged in the different dynamical driving processes are investigated. It is demonstrated that spin‐dependent time‐periodical periodic driving can result in shifted topological edge modes with non‐zero (nor ) quasi‐energies. Such shifted topological edge modes are not only related to the spin imbalance at each instantaneous time, but also the details of the dynamical driving. Here, it is also illustrated that the spin‐dependent time‐periodical driving can be conceived as the time‐spin coupling, and similar to the static spatial spin‐orbit coupling, tuning time‐spin coupling parameters can lead to topological phase transitions. Experimental simulations on the spin‐dependent time‐periodic driving are proposed by shaking optical super‐lattices and Raman assisted tunneling.",

Efficiency and universality are two desirable properties of a QNN but are unfortunately contradictory. In this work, a deep Ising Born machine (DIBoM) is examined, and shown that it has a good balance between efficiency and universality. More precisely, the DIBoM has a flexible number of parameters to be efficient, and achieves provable universality with sufficient parameters. The architecture of the DIBoM is based on generalized controlled‐Z gates, conditional gates, and some other ingredients. To compare the universality of the DIBoM with other QNNs, a fidelity‐based expressivity measure is proposed, which may be of independent interest. Extensive empirical evaluations corroborate that the DIBoM is both efficient and expressive.",

This nontrivial topology robust to nonmagnetic disorders and defects is considered one of the biggest obstacles for modulations of the surface state. In this work, the suppression of surface properties in Bi 2 Se 3 of various thicknesses grown on antiferromagnetic NiO, which has a strong exchange interaction is investigated. Under perpendicular magnetic fields, a drastic decrease in mobility µ and in the number of phase coherent channels α in 5 QL Bi 2 Se 3 on NiO are observed. In addition, the THz transmission study shows that an increase in the surface penetration depth ξ can accelerate the hybridization of surface states, which is also verified using the optical pump THz probe. This rapid collapse of surface states indicates the unique role of antiferromagnetic materials in band overlap, suggesting that the topological surface nature can be modulated by forming an antiferromagnet‐topological insulator heterostructure.",

While scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) exhibits remarkable capabilities in characterizing MZMs, additional geometrical constraints are imperative for achieving precise and controllable manipulation of these zero modes. To this end, it is of great help to integrate a micro mask within a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system to grow specific patterns containing MZMs. Here, a scenario for manipulating the MZMs in the vortex cores based on a triangular grid architecture is proposed. Additionally, a stencil lithography setup that is compatible with a combined MBE and STM system is introduced and experimentally demonstrated. A fine‐tuning of the Pb patterns, between a hexagonal antidot lattice to a triangular grid array, is achieved by adjusting the spatial gap between the stencil mask and the underlying substrate. This study provides new possibilities for the fabrication and investigation of Majorana devices.",

Modeled as a Rabi dimer, the device comprises of two interacting transmission‐line resonators, each coupled to a qubit. The qubits, driven by independent harmonic fields, are further modulated by a micromechanical resonator mimicked by a phonon mode. The impacts of two independent driving fields on the qubit dynamics are carefully examined. The energy diagram of the system and the photon number mobilization on the resonators are analyzed to explain the behavior of the LZ transitions and qubit dynamics while taking into account the influence of the single phonon mode. Results show that low phonon frequencies can alter the qubit dynamics, particularly in the absence of the driving fields, and a strong phonon coupling strength can significantly perturb the qubit dynamics, thanks to a high influx of phonon energy. Notably, only the photon frequency affects the oscillation frequency of qubit polarization. This study unveils the imperative roles that photons and phonons play in the Rabi dimer model.",

However, controlling a single spin qubit within a set of qubits is challenging due to the spatial extent of the applied magnetic field, which can negatively impact the coherent dynamics of neighboring qubits. In this study, a scheme is proposed for characterizing and controlling the coherent dynamics of spin qubits. The proposed scheme comprises a resonator that encloses the desired quantum system and a modulated electron beam that passes through the resonator in close proximity to the qubit of interest. The scheme involves solving the quantum master equation with Lindblad terms to obtain the system's dynamics. Reliability of the proposed model is validated by testing it on a potassium atom, 41 K, and an NV ‐ center in diamond. The results demonstrate that by controlling the parameters of the resonator and electron beam, the coherence and decoherence rates of these quantum systems can be enhanced. The proposed scheme has the potential to characterize various types of spin‐based quantum systems and implement quantum logic gates for quantum computation .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Even though quantum algorithms are designed using an idealised high‐level quantum circuit description, the execution on real devices must consider the backend physical properties. Contemporary noisy intermediate‐scale quantum (NISQ) computers are characterized by limited inter‐qubit connectivity and an exclusive set of native gates, whose execution is affected by non‐negligible errors and non‐idealities. Quantum compilation, consisting of logic and layout synthesis, aims to recast the original circuit description to the target hardware by solving the coupling‐constraint and to minimize the execution time and the error rate. While a previous article addresses the first phase, the second one is the aim of this manuscript. Currently available layout tools mainly target superconducting technology. This article tries to match the unmet need for a layout synthesis library supporting a wider range of technologies. The most promising algorithms already present in the state of the art are adapted to extend the compatibility to all the supported technologies, and new approaches, which exploit the awareness of the coupling strength in fully‐connected topologies, are proposed. The integrated procedures are benchmarked against IBM's Qiskit and Cambridge Quantum Computing's compilation toolchains, and even though these strategies can be further improved, the results are encouraging.",

Its atomic size enables integrations of a tremendous amount ( n NV ) of NV centers in a bulk diamond with a sensitivity scaling as . However, such a bulk sensor requires a high‐power laser to polarize and read out the NV centers. The increasing thermal damage and additional noises associated with high‐power lasers hinder the growth of n NV , and thus limit the sensitivity at picotesla level. Here, it shows a relaxometry‐based microwave magnetometer that the power density is determined by the relaxation time T 1 . By cooling the diamond sensor to prolong the T 1 (≈s), the required power density further reduces to , of the saturation value. This work paves the way for the utilization of large‐size diamond to promote the sensitivity of diamond magnetometer to femtotesla level and beyond.",

    "abstract": "In a world where Quantum Networks are rapidly becoming a reality, the development of the Quantum Internet is gaining increasing interest. Nevertheless, modern quantum networks are still in the early stages of development and have limited capacity to distribute resources among different users -- a constraint that needs to be taken into account. In this work we aim to investigate these constraints, using a novel setup for implementing Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs), communication protocols known for their quantum advantage over their classical counterparts and semi-device-independent self-testing applications. Our QRAC states, made for the first time using weak coherent pulses instead of entangled single photons, allow us to experimentally test our encoding and decoding strategy from the resource allocation perspective. Moreover, by emulating a coexistent classical communication, we test the resilience of our implementation in presence of noise. The achieved results represent a significant milestone both for theoretical studies of quantum resource allocation and for the implementation of quantum infrastructures capable of coexisting with regular telecommunication networks.",

A new approach to design spin‐chain‐based spin network systems, for short‐range quantum information processing and phase‐sensing, has been proposed recently in Advanced Quantum Technologies .

Furthermore, more complex SN designs, which can produce different types of entangled states, are presented.

The study aims at illustrating the role of counter‐rotating couplings in the long‐time evolution of the Λ system. The TRWA and variational approach are found to be consistent with each other and predict that there exist long‐lived oscillatory behaviors of ground‐state populations and coherence, which are robust in the presence of strong dissipation and arise from the counter‐rotating‐coupling‐induced virtual photon processes. The oscillation amplitude and frequency depend on the system‐reservoir coupling strength and the frequency difference between the two ground states, which can be qualitatively and quantitatively captured by the TRWA analytical results. Present results offer insights into the impact of the counter‐rotating couplings on the long‐time evolution of the strongly dissipative multilevel system as well as the protocol of generation of coherent oscillations by relaxation in a strong‐coupling regime.",

    "abstract": "2019 promises to be a crucial year for the emerging field of quantum technologies. On the funding side, the Quantum Technologies Flagship of the European Union has kicked off with the first 20 projects,1 and the total funding is expected to reach €1bn over the coming decade.2 Other world regions are not being left behind: In the US, Congress has recently passed the National Quantum Initiative Act, likewise a 10-year program with a budget of $1.3bn. This bold concept is accompanied by further support from government agencies such as the DOE and NSF. Research activities are being intensified not only in academia and research laboratories but also in the R&D centers of giant corporations such as Google, IBM, Microsoft and in many other companies. A key goal is to couple ever more qubits and to demonstrate a working quantum computer that will be able to achieve the ‘holy grail’ of quantum supremacy in computational power – if not yet today or tomorrow, then certainly in the years to come. Last but not least, the Chinese government has announced the provision of no less than $10bn to create a National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences. China has already taken crucial steps in creating a quantum network, including satellite-based communication. So, clearly the world is not short of opportunities in pursuing new and exciting quantum science, as well as its applications. On the other hand, it is more than obvious that there are still many fundamental scientific questions to be solved, not to speak of the development of real technologies that are still in their infancy to be implemented on a broader scale. Our journal Advanced Quantum Technologies (QUTE) (www.advquantumtech.com), a young member of the renowned Advanced journal family published by Wiley-VCH, aims to provide a peer-reviewed high quality forum for these topics, ranging from the theoretical basics to future device applications. Key areas include quantum-based communication, computation, control, engineering, information, metrology, optics, sensing and simulation, as well as adjacent areas such as nanophotonics, quasiparticle excitations, topological materials, superconductors, micro- and nano-electromechanical systems, ultracold atoms and others. The first three issues published in 2018 already provided a glimpse of our intended broad topical spectrum, with Reviews on continuous-variable quantum key distribution,3 non-equilibrium Bose–Einstein-like condensation4 and integrated quantum photonics based on diamond,5 accompanied by original research contributions as Communications or Full Papers. Now, what do we have in store for the New Year: The present issue features, for example, a Review on topological insulators and semimetals for magnetoresistive sensors6 and a Progress Report on the Dicke model being relevant for quantum optics.7 Later during 2019, we also plan to present two special issues on the topics of Quantum Machine Learning and Photonic Quantum Technologies that will aim to provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in these respective fields. Most importantly, please be reminded that the journal is open for original research submissions at www.editorialmanager.com/advquantumtech as well as your proposals for review-type contributions that you may send to advquantumtech@wiley.com at any time. We will also use forthcoming conference opportunities such as the APS March Meeting in Boston, several DPG (German Physical Society) meetings as well as various events in Asia to meet with you personally to get to know your research, to invite you to submit as well to learn more about the publication needs of the quantum community. Feel free to get in touch with us through any physical or virtual channel! For those of you who might be new to our journals: Online submission and online publication (no print) in QUTE are completely cost-free, and the journal is also free-to-read for anybody during the whole year. If you would like to make use of open-access options, Wiley OnlineOpen with various open access licenses is available through an increasing number of national, consortial or funder agreements (such as the ‘DEAL’ soon to be implemented in Germany8) or via payment of the respective article publication charge by your institution or funder. Details are provided in the ‘Contribute’ section of our homepage. You may also post a preprint of your manuscript to arXiv.org or similar servers, or to a scientific collaboration network that is compliant with the STM sharing principles.9 When doing so, please make sure that the journal reference is always up to date, including the DOI and/or URL of your journal-published article. More information on general article sharing principles is available on howcanishareit.com. These should help you to achieve maximum visibility both of your newest publication and of our young journal, as will news stories on selected top content on our news portal advancedsciencenews.com.

The edge states are protected by time-reversal symmetry and insensitive to disorders. The unique edges of QSH materials provide a route to generate and detect Majorana fermions, which is a possible solution on quantum computing. In article number 1900026, Chuanwu Cao and Jian-Hao Chen review the development of the understanding and construction of the QSH states with an emphasis on the materials perspective.",

    "abstract": "The development of quantum mechanics and quantum physics in general is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century. Initially, quantum physicists focused on mathematically describing and understanding the laws of a micro-world, comprised of atoms, molecules and photons. Nuclei and sub-atomic particles were discovered, particle physics evolved, and complex quantum systems in chemistry and solid-state physics are now described in terms of quantum physics. Within a century, quantum physics became the framework, which allows us to describe and predict, albeit with probabilities, the behavior of the microscopic world as we know it. The powerful quantum framework led to revolutionary technical advances for a century, such as semiconductor technology and the entire electronics industry based on it, enabling computers and the information age. The development of lasers found applications in many areas of our current technologies; we use them for printers, storing and retrieving information using CDs, industrial welding, medical surgery, and for range finding and communication purposes. Medical imaging using MRI is now a routine instrument, as are precision measurements using tunneling and atomic force microscopes. Superconducting technologies are used for high magnetic fields and many more current technologies are based on and enabled by the laws of quantum physics. While the framework of quantum physics has thus proven to be extremely successful and powerful, throughout the last century there were many conceptual, and to some extent philosophical, discussions on our understanding of quantum physics. As early as the 1930s, Einstein and Schrödinger realized that quantum physics allows for some peculiar states, which Schrödinger called “entangled”, which have a non-local character and thus do find an easy interpretation in our classical world. It took a few more decades until John Bell conceived a way to quantify such states, which thus became amenable to measurements. Only in the eighties and nineties of the last century did the generation of entangled states, their characterization and their subsequent application become feasible and accessible in laboratories. Early on, Bell states were proposed for applications in quantum communication, employing protocols based on teleportation. Soon, entanglement was recognized to be useful also for sensing, for precision measurements and eventually for quantum information processing. Starting with the early concept of a trapped-ion quantum computer introduced by Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller in 1995, many other platforms were proposed for quantum information processing, based on superconducting quantum bits, photonic processes, engineered quantum dots and many more. The first decade of the 21st century saw an explosive development of quantum information physics, which is by now a mature field and increasingly focuses on applications. Worldwide efforts are ongoing to realize quantum networks for secure communication and to implement quantum computers. Enhanced sensing has been demonstrated using advanced quantum states, and quantum simulators have been developed, already tackling problems that are hard to compute with classical computers. While architectures for full-fledged quantum computers are already available, the realization of such computers still requires the routine implementation of error correction, which is not yet available, for full scalability. Currently, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors are already used for computations and are even accessible via cloud services. Since about 2000, quantum technologies have been developed for many platforms with the aim to surpass the capablities of their classical counterparts. Many such devices now make use of entangled states, which are seen as the new resource for advanced quantum technologies. For this, describing, understanding and generally mastering the generation and manipulation of entanglement is a key element. Moreover, both hardware and software technologies have to be improved in order to better control quantum devices. Mastering quantum phenomena for communication, metrology, simulation and computation purposes is currently one of the hottest topics in science since the wide applicability of quantum technologies will revolutionize these fields. The development of advanced quantum technologies is thus seen worldwide as a strategic area for generating technical knowledge and industrial evolution. This special issue intends to showcase the breadth and impact of the ongoing research in advancing quantum technologies. We have invited a selection of renowned scientists to present their work, and we are confident that this issue will find a broad readership and attract much interest within the scientific community.",

As an uncertainty measure it is generally believed to be positive. This holds for any information quantity from two random variables because of the polymatroidal axioms. However, it is unknown why there is negative information for more than two random variables on finite dimensional spaces. It is first shown that the negative tripartite Shannon mutual information implies specific Bayesian network representations of its joint distribution. Then it is shown that the negative Shannon information is obtained from general tripartite Bayesian networks with quantum realizations. This provides a device‐independent witness of negative Shannon information. Finally the result is extended for general networks. The present result shows new insights in the network compatibility from non‐Shannon information inequalities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ever since the seminal work by Yu and Eberly [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 , 140404 (2004)], it has become widely accepted that nonlocal entanglement is more fragile than local coherence, in the sense that even under the influence of pure vacuum noise, the two‐qubit entanglement may end within a finite time, while the single‐qubit coherence always decays exponentially. By contrast, in this paper, it is shown that, for a pair of rotating qubits under pure vacuum noise with appropriate orbital radius and angular velocity, nonlocal entanglement as compared to local coherence is not only more resilient against vacuum noise to be preserved in the steady‐state for initially entangled states, but more importantly is also predestined to be created and be preserved for initially separable states. The generation of predestined entanglement here is essentially different from the dissipative steady‐state entanglement generation in existing schemes insofar as it is inevitably generated in pure vacuum instead of an elaborately designed environment.",

Hence, the Rivest‐Shamir‐Adleman (RSA) cryptographic moduli pertain to this set. A function can be defined therein which will be associated to the energy of a system of ions in a Penning trap. This is the quantum factoring simulator hypothesis connecting quantum mechanics with number theory. Here, a possible setup of the simulator from the magnetron energies of a Coulomb crystal in a cylindrical trap is described. Then, quantum mechanically, these energies may have only discrete values. To test the validity of the simulator hypothesis, evidence of this kind of discreteness from the statistics of the of a large random sample of RSA moduli is reported; indeed, their unfolded distance probability distribution fits to a Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, exactly as required if they actually correspond to the quantum energy levels spacing of a magnetically confined system that exhibits chaos. The confirmation of these predictions is consistent with the quantum simulator hypothesis and, thereby, it points to the existence of a liaison between quantum mechanics and number theory.",

    "abstract": "Dear Reader, Since the launch of our journal Advanced Quantum Technologies (QUTE for short) in 2018, we have been witnessing plenty of very promising research initiatives and activities in the diverse fields of quantum science, quantum materials, and quantum technologies. Key questions like “Where is quantum technology taking us? What are challenges and perspectives?” led our Editorial Advisor Rainer Blatt to edit a special issue Advancing Quantum Technologies – Chances and Challenges that we published in November 2020 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/25119044/2020/3/11). It broadly showcases how to master quantum phenomena for communication, metrology, sensing, simulation, and computation purposes. In a related virtual mini-symposium Rainer Blatt invited the authors Christoph Becher, Dagmar Bruss, Klemens Hammerer, Dieter Meschede, Christian Ospelkaus, and Robert Raussendorf to share their visions of the quantum future, which culminated in a vivid discussion (https://www.workcast.com/register?cpak=6284277449925096). Yet another recent quantum science webinar targeting a large Chinese audience featured our authors Tongcang Li and Yongjian Han who gave talks on quantum simulation in optical systems and quantum spin optomechanics, respectively. Further activities are being planned for 2021 in order to stay in close contact with the quantum community even during the pandemic. Earlier in 2020 Mohamed Benyoucef, Anthony Bennett, Stephan Götzinger, and Chaoyang Lu threw the spotlight on Photonic Quantum Technologies by editing a special issue (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/25119044/2020/3/2). The topics addressed include hybrid integration of single-photon emitters, cavity QED and light–matter interactions at the nanoscale, on-chip integration of entangled photon sources, and incorporating color centers into nanophotonic structures. Fabrication of suspended converters, single-photon emission at the telecom wavelength, molecule-based single-photon sources, quantum emitter–plasmonic cavity coupling, vertically coupled quantum dot systems, and optomechanical coupling are also discussed. We are happy to announce that our young and growing journal is being indexed in Web of Science. We are confident that the enhanced visibility of QUTE will trigger increasing submission numbers and a growing impact on the thriving field of quantum science and technology. Table 1 lists the presently most cited articles, exemplifying the broad spectrum of review-type and original research content contributed by authors from all over the world. Wiley has a number of agreements in place with institutions and funders to help authors publish open access and ensure compliance with open access policies. Your institution may be able to help with open access Article Publication Charges (APCs) that may be covered in full or part for affiliated authors publishing in Wiley fully open access journals or in a subscription journal through OnlineOpen. Find out if your institution or funder will cover your open access APCs and make your article open access: https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/affiliation-policies-payments/institutional-funder-payments.html There are also several national deals where authors from an institution affiliated with an open access deal may publish primary research and review articles open access at no charge to the author. This applies to, e.g., Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Norway, and the United Kingdom. For more information and to view eligibility criteria: https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/affiliation-policies-payments/index.html Nonetheless, QUTE is a hybrid journal, i.e., also publishing subscription content following the Copyright Transfer Agreement, which is free of charge to authors who do not possess open access publication funds. To make the licensing process easier, a new tool was rolled out prompting all license signing (Copyright Transfer Agreements or Creative Commons licenses) to the Author Services Platform. Corresponding authors, especially those who are eligible for OnlineOpen, can choose the most suitable publication conditions for their articles in QUTE. We would like to sincerely thank our authors, reviewers, Advisory Board members, and readers, for entrusting our journal with their research and expertise. We wish you all the best, and a happy and healthy new year. Kind regards, QUTE editorial team P.S.

    "abstract": "Abstract Different from the general schemes of two‐mode mechanical squeezing, a dissipative scheme to generate strong and robust two‐mode mechanical squeezing via frequency modulation of cavity modes in a cavity optomechanical system consisting of a modulated two‐mode optical cavity and two mechanical oscillators is proposed. It is shown that the strong mechanical squeezing, which is highly robust against the thermal noise, can be engineered by means of cavity dissipation. Moreover, the squeezing mechanism is explored via analytical approach and it is found that the squeezing direction is controlled by modulation amplitude. The scheme provides an alternative pathway to generate strong mechanical–mechanical entanglement.",

    "abstract": "In article number 2100083, Arthur Leis, Bert Voigtländer and co-workers demonstrate nanoscale four-probe measurements on atomically thin topological insulator films. For this purpose, four individual scanning tunneling microscope tips are directly contacting individual terraces on the sample surface to quantify the thickness-dependent film conductivity. This enables the authors to detect a breakdown of spin-momentum locking in the topological surface state as a function of the film thickness. In the few-layer limit, this effect can realize helical edge modes along step edges with potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Researchers from Louisiana introduce a smart quantum technology for the spatial mode correction of single photons. In article number 2000103, Narayan Bhusal, Chenglong You, and co-workers exploit the self-learning and self-evolving features of artificial neural networks to correct the distorted spatial profile of single photons. The authors report a near-unity fidelity in the correction of spatial modes of light. This technique boosts the channel capacity of optical communication protocols that rely on structured photons. This work has important implications for quantum technologies operating at the single-photon level.",
