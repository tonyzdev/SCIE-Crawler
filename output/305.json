    "abstract": "Lean and green production was introduced to the western manufacturing industry nearly thirty years ago.The essence of the new business model was to eliminate waste through lean tools according to Taiichi Ohno's eight categories of waste.Many companies became more competitive with waste reduction techniques but some of them faced, and still are facing failures.Such failures are closely related with misapplication of lean and green tools, and its sequential order of implementation.In order to define most powerful lean tools for reduction of certain types of waste, a study was made among lean companies.The concept of a study was to define best lean toolbox for reduction of each category of waste and to determine right sequential order of lean tools implementation.Stepwise multiple regression model revealed that Total Productive Maintenance, Poka-Yoke, Kaizen, 5S, Kanban, Six Big Losses, Heijunka, Takt Time, Andon, OEE, SMED, and KPIs are best waste management techniques.Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that 5S, Kaizen, Kanban, Poka-Yoke and TPM are highly recommended for start of every lean manufacturing initiative.",

It is understood as determining the best alternative among many alternatives. In this study, the results of a multi-criteria decision-making study are presented. In which, sixteen experiments on turning process were carried out. The input parameters of the experiments are the cutting speed, the feed speed, and the depth of cut. After conducting the experiments, the surface roughness and the material removal rate (MRR) were determined. To determine which experiment guarantees the minimum surface roughness and maximum MRR simultaneously, four multi-criteria decision-making methods including the MAIRCA, the EAMR, the MARCOS, and the TOPSIS were used. Two methods the Entropy and the MEREC were used to determine the weights for the criteria. The combination of four multi-criteria making decision methods with two determination methods of the weights has created eight ranking solutions for the experiments, which is the novelty of this study. An amazing result was obtained that all eight solutions all determined the same best experiment. From the obtained results, a recommendation was proposed that the multi-criteria making decision methods and the weighting methods using in this study can also be used for multi-criteria making decision in other cases, other processes.",

In fact, in case of fracture of human bones, the best way to better and faster knitting is when a traumatologist fixes the fractured bone ends by drilling and setting the immobilization plates by screws. Because of the drilling process, the surrounding bone tissue is heated and if the temperature around the drilled bone hole exceeds the critical limit, this may result in thermal necrosis, which means the irreversible death of the bone cells exposed to that high temperature. The paper researches the possibilities of decreasing the value of axial force and temperature of bone drilling process with a proper selection of influencing parameters in drilling. Also, the presents the obtained results of the influence of drill type geometry on the temperature of bone drilling and possibilities of high speed drilling process in thermal bone necrosis avoidance.

A mathematical model is developed with the objective of minimising the maximum completion time for a mixed flow shop scheduling problem, and a genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem. The validity of the model is verified through the case study, which can provide a reasonable scheduling solution for actual manufacturing.

However, due to the environmental externality of green production, it is different for a pure market mechanism to promote the evolution of green operation mode of manufacturing enterprises. Government regulation is very important. This paper establishes an evolutionary game model of whether manufacturing enterprises choose to implement green production mode when the government implements two different mechanisms of reward and punishment. Considering the complexity of strategy selection of enterprises' green production behaviour under market competition, the method constructs the simulation analysis model of enterprises' green product production behaviour with multi-subject participation. We can simulate the influence of these factors on the strategic choice of both parties (enterprises and governments) by changing the different influence factors, and studying the evolutionary law of different government guidance and regulation strategies on the production behaviour of green products. These factors include government incentives, penalties, reputations, costs, differences in the cost of implementing green production on the corporate side, corporate reputation, and false rewards or penalties. By the computer implementation of multi-subject modelling, the results show that enterprises' green product production behaviour needs the government's guidance and regulation. When formulating relevant policies, the government should combine various guidance and regulation strategies and fully consider the influence of market competition.",

In this study we propose a smart Warehouse 4.0 solution by using QR code, open-source software tools for machine vision and conventional surveillance equipment. Although there have been concerns regarding the usage of QR in logistics, it has shown to be suitable for the particular use-case as pallets are static in the interwarehouse. The reliability of reading of QR codes was achieved by using multiple IP cameras, so that sub-optimal view angle or light reflection is compensated with alternative views. Since surveillance technology and machine vision are constantly evolving and becoming more affordable, we report that more attention needs to be invested into their adaptation to fit the needs and budgets of SMEs, which are the industrial cornerstone in the most developed countries.

Although the introduction of collaborative workplaces can be cost-effective, there is still much uncertainty about how such workplaces affect the capacity of the rest of production system. The article presents the importance of introducing collaborative workplaces in manual assembly operations where the production capacities are already limited. With the simulation modelling method, the evaluation of the introduction impact of collaborative workplaces on manual assembly operations that represent bottlenecks in the production process is presented. The research presents two approaches to workplace performance evaluation, both simulation modelling and a real-world collaborative workplace example, as a basis of a detailed time study. The main findings are comparisons of simulation modelling results and a study of a real-world collaborative workplace, with graphically and numerically presented parameters describing the utilization of production capacities, their efficiency and financial justification. The research confirms the expediency of the collaborative workplaces use and emphasise the importance of further research in the field of their technological and sociological impacts.",

However, many manufacturers have difficulty determining to what extent these various technologies can reinforce the autonomy of teams and operational systems. This article addresses this issue by proposing a model describing different types of autonomy and the contribution of 4.0 technologies in the various steps of the decision-making processes. The model was confronted with a set of application cases from the literature. It emerges that new technologies' improvements are significant from a decision-making point of view and may eventually favor implementing new modes of autonomy. Decision-makers can rely on the proposed model to better understand the opportunities linked to the fusion of cybernetic, physical, and social spaces made possible by Industry 4.0.",

In the RL part, this study designed a two-layer online learning mode in which the sample collection and the training improvement proceed alternately, the outer layer collects samples, when the collected samples meet the requirement of batch size, it enters to the inner layer loop, which uses the Q-learning model-free batch processing mode to proceed, and adopts neural network to approximate the value function to adapt to large-scale problems.

    "abstract": "Modern assembly systems adapt to the requirements of customised and short-lived products. As assembly tasks become increasingly complex and change rapidly, the cognitive load on employees increases. This leads to the use of assistance systems for manual assembly to detect and avoid human errors and thus ensure consistent product quality. Most of these systems promise to improve the production environment but have hardly been studied quantitatively so far. Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have also not yet been fully exploited. This study aims to provide architectural, and implementational details of a state-of-the-art assembly assistance system based on an object detection model. The proposed architecture is intended to be representative of modern assistance systems. The error prevention potential is determined in a case study in which test subjects manually assemble a complex explosion-proof tubular lamp. The results show 51 % fewer assembly errors compared to a control group without assistance. Three of the four considered types of error classes have been reduced by at least 42 %. In particular, errors by omission are most likely to be prevented by the system. The reduction in the error rate is observed over the entire period of 30 consecutive product assemblies, comparing assisted and unassisted assembly. Furthermore, the recorded assembly data are found to be valuable regarding traceability and production improvement processes.",

In this context, a gap in the research has been observed in effective management methods, in order to gain a competitive advantage through the implementation and use of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies. The main purpose of the study is to build a new approach to management, based on the implementation of new AM technologies and good practice. This paper uses the detailed literature studies and results from the empirical research of some 250 Polish manufacturing enterprises; this material contains a sample thereof, processed into a new approach. The major contributions of the work are as follows: (1) identification of current management areas in which manufacturing companies focus their activities, in the context of Industry 4.0, (2) the establishment of the correlation between gaining a competitive advantage and implementing AM technologies in the context of Industry 4.0, (3) Defining the so-called AM4.0CARD as a new management approach, based on AM technologies and the requirements of Industry 4.0. Managers of manufacturing enterprises, thanks to the use of the proposed approach, may take a strategic decision, regarding the implementation of AM technologies, due to the possibility of forecasting the impact of such an investment on the improvement of the company's competitive advantage.",

Deep learning (DL) neural networks have certain advantages in handling complex dynamic JSPs with a massive amount of historical data. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic job-shop scheduling model based on DL. Firstly, a data prediction model was established for dynamic job-shop scheduling, with long short-term memory network (LSTM) as the basis; the Dropout technology and adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) were introduced to enhance the generalization ability and prediction effect of the model. Next, the dynamic JSP was described in details, and three objective functions, namely, maximum makespan, total device load, and key device load, were chosen for optimization. Finally, the multi-objective problem of dynamic JSP scheduling was solved by the improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The effectiveness of the algorithm was proved experimentally.",

In particular, the occurrence of uncertain emergencies increases the risk of interruption of the closed-loop supply chain, making it insufficient to analyze its complex changes from the perspective of material flow alone. Based on this analysis, the paper constructs a closed-loop supply chain material flow and capital flow coupling system composed of manufacturers, sellers and recyclers to explore the impact of material flow sudden interruption on the closed-loop supply chain system when an uncertain emergency occurs. In this paper, based on the closed-loop supply chain system coupled with logistics and capital flow, a system dynamics simulation model was established by using Vensim simulation software to analyze the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on manufacturers, sellers and recyclers under five scenarios. The results show that when COVID-19 outbreaks occur, the material flow of each main enterprise in the closed-loop supply chain is more easily influenced than the capital flow. At the same time, it can be found that the recyclers in the main enterprises of the closed-loop supply chain are more easily influenced by the material flow. The model constructed in this paper has applicability and can be used for related studies of closed-loop supply chain under other emergencies, but the scene design should be carried out according to the characteristics of emergencies themselves.",

At last, a material handling system of smart electrical connectors workshop was discussed to verify the scheduling model and the speed control strategy combined with the MapReduce framework is feasible and effective to reduce the AGV path conflict probability.

This is particularly challenging in labour-intensive industries, which is characterized by highly volatile customer demand and significant daily variability of available workers. The Uncertainty related to the key production parameters in the industry is causing disruptions in long-term production planning and optimization, which leads to the long lead production times, operational risks and accumulation of inventory. To address these challenges, production systems need to ensure adequate operational production planning and optimization of all variables that are influencing the productivity of their systems on a daily basis. To tackle the problem, this study elaborates the application of discrete event simulations and genetic algorithm, using the Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software, to support decision-making and operational production planning and optimization in the industry. The simulation model developed for this purpose considers: customers demand changes, variable production times, operationally available resources and production batch size, to provide an optimal production sequence with the highest number of produced pieces and the lowest total work in process (WIP) inventory per day. To demonstrate the efficiency of the methodology and prove the benefits of the selected optimization approach, a case study is conducted in the textile factory.",

The behaviour and functioning of these systems cannot be predicted with certainty as they belong to a group of probable determinate structures. Generally, if we wanted to know precisely the behaviour of this condition in advance, we would have to be able to describe them mathematically or observe the action of the system on a real object. By applying discrete event simulation software, we realize the development of environmentally friendly products and using the simulation, we gain the certainty that the planned tasks can be implemented in a given time frame, while the simulation of the production process can help to clearly clarify and better understand the processes. To choose the optimal manufacturing ways of cleaning the fabrics component from waste tyres, we used the Witness discrete event simulation software to determine the usability and time occupancy of individual machines in the production of new fabric-based material. We simulated the ultrasonic method of cleaning the fabrics component from waste tyres and the subsequent creation of the test specimen. After the simulation, the obtained data can be used by a selection of type and number of machines and auxiliary equipment, by numbers of tools and fixtures, and by numbers of transport equipment. Obtained results bring the best layout of the workplace, the optimal dose of input materials and resources used in production. We have identified bottlenecks in the machines with long waiting times.

    "abstract": "Machining of nickel based alloys is in most of the times affected via high mechanical and thermal loads, causing high wear tendency of carbide tools, even at relatively low cutting speeds.On the other hand, ceramic as a cutting material, is more chemically stable and retains its hardness even at higher temperatures (> 800 °C) when machining difficult-to-cut materials.Therefore, to increase productivity, as an alternative to carbide tools, full body ceramic milling tools are proposed.In this paper, high speed milling process, using full body ceramic end milling tools, was analysed in parallel to carbide tools.Tool life of ceramic tools was compared with tool life of more widely used carbide tools when milling two different difficult-to-cut materials, i. e. nickel based alloy Inconel 718 and austenitic stainless steel 316L, under different cooling lubrication conditions.In addition, surface integrity and cost analysis were taken into account.Results are showing that ceramic milling tools are increasing material removal rate and productivity.However, the overall efficiency of ceramic tools can still be economically questionable.",

A step task scheduling and path optimization mode of AGV is proposed. The process is as follows: Firstly, a mathematical model algorithm and a material transportation task allocation algorithm based on the urgency degree of workpiece processing were established for the optimization objective, and all workpiece transportation task sequences between shelves and processing equipment were assigned to the corresponding AGV to generate the initial feasible path of each AGV. Then, the AGV collision detection and anti-collision algorithm are designed to plan the global collision-free walking path of multi-AGVs in the workshop, and the path can be dynamically adjusted according to the delivery task. The model is solved by a heuristic algorithm ant colony algorithm and MATLAB coding. Finally, an example is given to verify the effectiveness of the method, which can effectively solve the task allocation of multi-AGVs and avoid collision path planning based on the transportation task sequence, and improve the work efficiency of AGV. This research can provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for realizing multi AGVs collaborative scheduling by using AGV automated material transport system in an intelligent production workshop.",

Then, cost models for both the traditional supply chain and the novel supply chain using blockchain technology are developed and the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain operating costs is determined. The results demonstrate that blockchain technology can effectively reduce supply chain operating costs. In addition, this study has an interesting finding that if blockchain adoption is valuable for the supply chain, the quantity of information-sensitive should be moderate. Too many or too few information-sensitive retailers can reduce the value of the blockchain's use.

This study introduces obvious improvements in the surface quality of the AM parts by means of ultrasonic abrasive polishing (UAP), which uses cavitation collapse and micro-cut of abrasive particles for finishing surfaces. Experiments were conducted using the orthogonal experimental design method with an L_9(3^4) orthogonal array to investigate the effects of ultrasonic power, machining time, abrasive particle size, and particle concentration on surface roughness Ra and material removal rate (MRR). The wear of the abrasive particles in the slurry was also studied. IN625 nickel-based alloy specimen manufactured by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) was chosen as the target workpiece. The results show that when the ultrasonic output power was too high, both surface quality and machining efficiency were deteriorated. And the surface roughness Ra was not further improved by just increasing the machining time. Severe cavitation erosion occurred in the polishing process and created leftover pits on the workpiece surface, which has a large influence on Ra. The size and amount of the abrasive particles should be within a certain range, which is helpful for material removal and improving the polishing performance. The work is useful for studying the influential process parameters involved in UAP and finding out the appropriate conditions.",

    "abstract": "Improving quality, enhancing productivity, redesigning machining tools, eliminating waste in production, and shortening lead time are all objectives aimed at improving customer satisfaction and increasing profitability for manufacturing companies. This study combines lean manufacturing and six sigma techniques to form a technique called Lean Six Sigma (LSS) by using the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analysis-Improve-Control) model. This study proposes to use statistical test models to analyze real data collected directly from the operator. The study proposes to use the Taguchi optimization technique to determine the optimal conditions for oil dipping tanks of molybdenum materials. In addition, the study also proposes a computer vision technique to recognize objects using color recognition techniques running on the LABVIEW software platform. This study builds a digital numerical control (DNC) model operating on digital signal processing techniques, linking the data of each process together. The results reduced the rate of defective parts in the whole processing stage from 6.5 % to zero defects, the whole processing line production capacity increased by 7.9 %, and the profit of the whole production line was USD 35762 per year. As a valuable external outcome, the conclusion of the LSS project fostered a spirit of continuous improvement. The utilization of research results from the research environment in the actual production setting is significantly enhanced for the operator. The LSS model is deployed with specific tasks and targets for each member of the LSS project team, and the processing conditions for each specific stage are optimized, such as the oil dipping process and hole grinding process. Industry 4.0 techniques, including computer vision, digital numerical control, and commercial software such as LabVIEW and MINITAB, are optimized for use, simplifying machining operations. Some proposed directions for future research are also presented in detail. For example, studying the improvement of the quality of the 220 V power supply through harmonic mitigation in processing factories is an intriguing area of investigation. Additionally, exploring data security for big data in the context of Industry 4.0 would be a valuable study to enhance customer satisfaction with big data technology in the future.",

This paper introduces an optimisation method based on deep reinforcement learning to schedule berths and yards at a bulk cargo terminal. A Markov Decision Process model is formulated by analysing scheduling processes and unloading operations in bulk port imports business. The study presents an enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm called PS-D3QN (Prioritised Experience Replay and Softmax strategy-based Dueling Double Deep Q-Network), amalgamating the strengths of the Double DQN and Dueling DQN algorithms. The proposed solution is evaluated using actual port data and benchmarked against the other two algorithms mentioned in this paper. The numerical experiments and comparative analysis substantiate that the PS-D3QN algorithm significantly enhances the efficiency of berth and yard scheduling in bulk terminals, reduces the cost of port operation, and eliminates errors associated with manual scheduling. The algorithm presented in this paper can be tailored to address scheduling issues in the fields of production and manufacturing with suitable adjustments, including problems like the job shop scheduling problem and its extensions.",

    "abstract": "In Supply Chain Management, a phenomenon called the “Bullwhip Effect” has attracted considerable attention. Overall supply chain evaluation needs to include the Bullwhip Effect. The Bullwhip Effect shows how small changes at the demand end of a supply chain are progressively amplified for operations further back in the chain. It is understood that demand forecast variance contributes to that effect in the chain. With this understanding, the authors experimented with two cases: stable demand with a single 5 % change in demand, and changing demand in periodic 10 % increases and later in the same decreases. Two stock keeping policies for all stages in the chain have been studied: to keep in stock i) one, and ii) two periods' demand. Results are shown in tables and charts. Increasing variability of production orders and stocks up the supply chain is evident. The effect indicates a lack of synchronization among supply chain members because of corrupt key information about actual demand. When we understand the nature of supply chain dynamics, there are several actions concerned with coordinating the activities of the operations in the chain, which is discussed in the last part of the paper.",

Since the beginning of the use of stents in medicine for atherosclerosis treatment, their development has changed rapidly. Various stents have also been developed with the development of materials science, treatment techniques and new manufacturing processes. In this way the development has shifted from the initial bare-metal stents (BMS), to drug-eluting stents (DES) and bio-resorbable stents (BRS), which are made of biodegradable polymers or metals. Various studies agree that it will be necessary to further review the experimentally obtained material properties with analytical and numerical studies. Here, the computational modelling (Finite element analysis - FEA and Computational fluid dynamics - CFD) was found as a valuable tool when evaluating stent mechanics and optimizing stent design. The development of the stent manufacturing technologies has also changed and been supplemented over the years. Nowadays, 3D printing could be an exciting manufacturing method to produce polymeric bio-materials, suitable for the latest generation of bio-degradable stents applications.",

Based on the survey data collected from 254 supply and purchasing managers in the Korean manufacturing industry, AMOS software with structural equation method was used for data analysis Our results support the concept that business uncertainty reduces self-efficacy in supply chain agility although both business uncertainty and supply chain disruption risk boosted trust in the supply chain as well as buyers’ positive attitude toward supply chain cooperation, coordination, and communication. The concept of supply chain agility, self-efficacy, trust, and supply chain cooperation, coordination, and communication attitude have a positive impact on firm performance. Supply chain agility, self-efficacy, and trust in suppliers positively affects implementation of supply chain agility as well as firms’ financial, operational, and supply chain performance.

A systematic literature review is carried out based on the type of 3D printing materials. The printing parameters which influence the mechanical characteristics of the FDM specimens are discussed based on the results presented in the literature. From the present study, it has been found that the process variables such as orientation, raster angle, raster width, layer height, and contours directly affect the quality of the 3D-printed parts. It has also been found that the effect of these process variables also varies with the type of thermoplastic materials. The present article will help researchers to select FDM processed material and appropriate process variables for further research.",

    "abstract": "With growing environmental concerns, the focus on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in transportation has increased, and the combination of smart microgrids and electric vehicles (EVs) brings a new opportunity to solve this problem. Electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is an extension of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) problem, which can reach the combination of smart microgrids and EVs precisely by scheduling the EVs. However, the current genetic algorithm (GA) for solving this problem can easily fall into the dilemma of local optimization and slow iteration speed. In this paper, we present an integer hybrid planning model that introduces time of use and area price to enhance realism. We propose the GA-A* algorithm, which combines the A* algorithm and GA to improve global search capability and iteration speed. We conducted experiments on 16 benchmark cases, comparing the GA-A* algorithm with traditional GA and other search algorithms, results demonstrate significant enhancements in searchability and optimal solutions. In addition, we measured the grid load, and the model implements the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode, which serves as peak shaving and valley filling by integrating EVs into the grid for energy delivery and exchange through battery swapping. This research, ranging from model optimization to algorithm improvement, is an important step towards solving the EVRPTW problem and improving the environment.",

    "abstract": "Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) is a further expansion of the classical job shop scheduling problem (JSSP). FJSSP is known to be NP-hard with regards to optimization and hence poses a challenge in finding acceptable solutions. Genetic algorithm (GA) has successfully been applied in this regard since last two decades. This paper provides an insight into the actual complexity of selected benchmark problems through quantitative evaluation of the search space owing to their NP-hard nature. A four-layered genetic algorithm is then proposed and implemented with adaptive parameters of population initialization and operator probabilities to manage intensification and diversification intelligently. The concept of reinitialization is introduced whenever the algorithm is trapped in local minima till predefined number of generations. Results are then compared with various other standalone evolutionary algorithms for selected benchmark problems. It is found that the proposed GA finds better solutions with this technique as compared to solutions produced without this technique. Moreover, the technique helps to overcome the local minima trap. Further comparison and analysis indicate that the proposed algorithm produces comparative and improved solutions with respect to other analogous methodologies owing to the diversification technique.",

Product disassembly is an effective way to recycle waste products, and it is a necessary condition to make the product life cycle complete. According to the characteristics of the product disassembly line, based on minimizing the number of workstations and balancing the idle time in the station, the harmful index, the demand index, and the number of direction changes are proposed as new optimization objectives. So based on the analysis of the traditional genetic algorithm into the precocious phenomenon, this paper constructed the multi-objective relationship of the disassembly line balance problem. The disassembly line balance problem belongs to the NP-hard problem, and the intelligent optimization algorithm shows excellent performance in solving this problem. Considering the characteristics of the traditional method solving the multi-objective disassembly line balance problem that the solution result was single and could not meet many objectives of balance, a multi-objective improved genetic algorithm was proposed to solve the model. The algorithm speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm. Based on the example of the basic disassembly task, by comparing with the existing single objective heuristic algorithm, the multi-objective improved genetic algorithm was verified to be effective and feasible, and it was applied to the actual disassembly example to obtain the balance optimization scheme. Two case studies are given: a disassembly process of the automobile engine and a disassembly of the computer components.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of precision engineering, particularly in deep hole boring processes, tool vibration emerges as a critical determinant of machining performance. This investigation elucidates the genesis of self-excited vibrations within deep hole boring operations and delineates the underlying mechanisms of cutting tool vibration. A focal point of this study is the optimal alignment of the boring bar to mitigate vibrational impacts, thereby enhancing surface finish quality and extending tool longevity. Central to this analysis is the employment of a Dynamic Vibration Absorber (DVA) aimed at attenuating cutting tool vibration. The deployment of DVA necessitates precise identification of modal parameters, namely the equivalent stiffness (K) and mass (M) of the cutting tool. This research juxtaposes various scholarly methodologies to amalgamate theoretical calculations with simulation approaches, thereby acquiring accurate modal parameters. Utilizing Matlab software, the vibration amplitude of the boring bar under varying spring stiffness scenarios was examined. Results indicate a direct correlation between increased stiffness and reduced amplitude, particularly when the frequency ratio 'g' ranges between 0.5 and 1.1. Consequently, a stiffer DVA configuration is posited as more effective in vibration reduction. Furthermore, the study conducted frequency sweep experiments on a damping boring bar, utilizing a vibration excitation platform. These experiments revealed the existence of an optimal stiffness value for the DVA, thereby underscoring the significance of stiffness matching in vibration mitigation strategies.",

A digital twin was created in the Simio software environment using a data-driven simulation model derived from a real-world production system. Running the digital twin in real time, which was displayed graphically, facilitated the analysis of key parameters, including the number of finished products, average flow time, workstation utilization and product quality. The discrepancies were attributed to the use of random distributions of input data in the dynamic digital twin, as opposed to the long-term measurements and averages in the real-world system. Despite the limitations in the case study, the results underline the financial justification and predictive capabilities of digital twins for optimising production systems. Real-time operation enables continuous evaluation and tracking of parameters and offers high benefits for intelligent production systems. The study emphasises the importance of accurate selection of input data and warns that even small deviations can lead to inaccurate results. Finally, the paper high-lights the role of digital twins in optimising production systems and argues for careful consideration of input data. It highlights the importance of analysing real-world production systems and creating efficient simulation models as a basis for digital twin solutions. The results encourage extending the research to different types of production, from job shop to mass production, in order to obtain a comprehensive optimisation perspective.",

    "abstract": "Early project risk identification and assessment is a complex issue based on decision-making methods that are methodically suitable for successful project delivery.Nevertheless, although there are several risk management assessment tools, in practice, this issue is still not taken seriously enough in the project initiation phase.Literature research reveals a need for an applicable systematic risk model approach, systematic sensitivity of mitigation action plans, considering the need for early systematic project risk awareness.This paper not only explains the evidence that a risk systematic model tool is essential in the project initiation phase but also narrows the gaps through the systematic sensitivity approach with the accent on the integrated risk systematic model.The sensitivity approach is taken in the project early preparation phase, where evaluation, the establishment of limits to which risks are controllable, is based on the stage-gate model.The stage-gate model evaluates which risks are specific to a certain analysis in the early project definition phase, leads to the conclusion that excluding any mitigation elements or probability of risk occurrence reflects on the outcomes, and presents an unrealistic picture of the given project targets.This research represents a reliable risk tool with improvements in resolving systematic risk system faults, 'stakeholders' subjective decision gaps, constricting project contingency, and shortening project schedule deviation.The research is based on two complex industry (case studies) projects within the energy industry.",

    "abstract": "Facing competition from manufacturers' online direct channels, how retailers make sales channel decisions to increase consumer stickiness has become the core concern of the industry and academia. Empirical research showed that delivery lead time is a key factor that affects consumers' preference for online channels. To analyze the impact of consumer delivery time preference on channel selection and pricing strategy of retailers, consumer delivery lead time preference function was improved from a linear function to an exponential function and consumer demand under the mixed dual-channel supply chain of manufacturer and retailer was derived. Then, the Stackelberg game models under different channel strategies of retailer were established and solved. Results show that consumer preference for delivery lead time has four implications on the channel decision of retailers under manufacturer encroachment in the dual-channel supply chain. First, the dual retail channels strategy is the optimal choice for retailers, and the profit margins that a retailer obtains from dual retail channels supply chain and single online retail channel supply chain will increase as consumers' delivery lead time preference coefficient increases. Second, the optimal pricing of online retail channel and offline retail channel is positively related to consumers' delivery lead time preference coefficient. By contrast, the optimal pricing of online direct channel is negatively related to consumers' delivery lead time preference coefficient. Third, the optimal pricing of online retail channel is higher than that of offline retail and online direct channels. Fourth, a retailer and a manufacturer can adopt a compensation-based whole price contract to address the conflict brought about by the optimal channel choice of the retailer. This study introduces consumer delivery lead time preference into retailer channel decision making and provides a theoretical reference for retailer's mixed channel construction in practice.",

This study proposes a multi-objective mixed integer programming model for an integrated green closed-loop supply chain network designed to maximize profit, amicable production level (environmentally friendly materials and clean technology usage), and quality level. A scenario-based robust optimization method is used to deal with uncertain parameters such as the demand of new products, the return rates of returned products and the sale prices of remanufactured products. The proposed model is applied to a real industry case example of a manufacturing company to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. The result shows a robust optimal resource allocation solution that considers multiple scenarios.

    "abstract": "Generating economies of scale is one of the most desirable goals when developing modular product systems. Since complex products are commonly developed in collaboration between an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and its suppliers, pursuing this goal inherently establishes interdependencies between the development process, supplier integration and supply chain design. To fully reap the benefits of modular product systems requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses these fields and addresses the inter-dependencies between them via a coherent collaboration between development and purchasing. This is the main focus of this work. In this paper, we first describe how the product development process has to be restructured for the concerted development of modules and overall products within the scope of a modular product system. Secondly, we propose a new collaboration model between the OEM and its suppliers, since OEMs need to collaborate directly with suppliers of lower levels of the value chain in order to facilitate the standardisation of components and modules across different products. Finally, we delineate an awarding process for both development services and production volumes for series supply that resolves the conflicting priorities of economies of scale and avoiding over-dependence on single suppliers. The process models described in this paper have been conceived based on systems engineering principles and have been successfully tested and further refined throughout several industrial projects carried out with two automotive manufacturers. The resulting approach will be demonstrated using a generic example taken from the automotive industry.",

Based on the airport reality, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model for airport ferry vehicle scheduling is proposed in this paper, in which the first objective is to minimize the number of vehicles used, and the second objective is to minimize the maximum number of flights per ferry vehicle serving under the constraint that the first objective takes the optimal value. For the optimization model of the second objective, this paper designs three heuristic algorithms: strict equalization algorithm, relaxed equalization algorithm and transplantation algorithm, and integrates them into a main algorithm. The actual flight data of Beijing Capital International Airport are used for numerical examples, and all the examples tested can obtain the exact solution or high-quality approximate solution using the designed algorithm, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm. This study can be used to inform decisions on the efficient and balanced use of airport ferry vehicles.

A five-channel, two-dimensional matrix that expressed the state characteristics of the production system was used to capture the state of the real-time production of the workshop. Adaptive scheduling was achieved by using a reward function that corresponds to the minimum total tardiness, and the common production dispatching rules were used as the action space.

The sequential clustering and classification technique (SCC) is used in this work to not only identify and categorize the defects but also investigate their root causes. Conventional clustering techniques like k-means, fuzzy c-means, and self-organizing map are employed in the first stage to find the defects in the finished products. Then, a novel clustering method, that combines a sine-cosine algorithm and possibilistic fuzzy c-means (SCA-PFCM), is proposed to classify the detected defects into multiple groups to identify the defect categories and analyze the root causes of failures. In the second stage, the ground truth labels taken from the clustering technique are used to construct an automated inspection system using back propagation neural networks (BPNN). The proposed approach is applicable for detecting and identifying the causes of errors in manufacturing industry. This study applies a case study in nipper manufacture. The SCA-PFCM algorithm can detect 97 % of defects and classify them into four types while BPNN shows a predicted accuracy of up to 96 %. Additionally, an automated inspection system is developed to reduce the time and cost of the inspection process.",

Printing temperature, layer thickness and raster angle were considered as input process parameters. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid PSI – TOPSIS method, the obtained results were compared with the results obtained with different MCDM methods. The obtained best option of process parameters was confirmed by other MCDM methods. The optimal combination of process parameters to achieve the maximal flexural strength, maximal flexural modulus and maximal compressive strength is selected using the hybrid PSI-TOPSIS method.

This paper proposes a train delay prediction model that considers the delay propagation feature. The model consists of two parts. The first part is the extraction of delay propagation feature. The best delay classification scheme is determined through the clustering method of delay types for historical data based on the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN), and combining the best delay classification scheme and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to design the classification method of delay type for online data. The delay propagation factor is used to quantify the delay propagation relationship, and on this basis, the horizontal and vertical delay propagation feature are constructed. The second part is the delay prediction, which takes the train operation status feature and delay propagation feature as input feature, and use the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to complete the prediction. The model was tested and simulated using the actual train operation data, and compared with random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results show that considering the delay propagation feature in the train delay prediction model can further improve the accuracy of train delay prediction. The delay prediction model proposed in this paper can provide a theoretical basis for the intelligentization of railway dispatching, enabling dispatchers to control delays more reasonably, and improve the quality of railway transportation services.",

    "abstract": "Ultrafast laser has an undeniable advantage in laser processing due to its extremely small pulse width and high peak energy. While the interaction of ultrafast laser and solid materials is an extremely non-equilibrium process in which the material undergoes phase transformation and even ablation in an extremely short time range. This is the coupling of the thermos elastic effect caused by the pressure wave and the superheated melting of the material lattice. To further explore the mechanism of the action of ultrafast laser and metal materials, the two-temperature model coupling with molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the interaction of the copper and laser energy. Firstly, the interaction of single-pulsed laser and copper film was reproduced, and the calculated two-temperature curve and the visualized atomic snapshots were used to investigate the influence of laser parameters on the ablation result. Then, by changing the size of the atomic system, the curve of ablation depth as a function of laser fluence was obtained. In this paper, the interaction of multi-pulsed laser and copper was calculated. Two-temperature curve and temperature contour of copper film after the irradiation of double-pulsed and multi-pulsed laser were obtained. And the factors which can make a difference to the incubation effect were analyzed. By calculating the ablation depth under the action of multi-pulsed laser, the influence of the incubation effect on ablation results was further explored. Finally, a more accurate numerical model of laser machining metal is established and verified by an ultra-short laser processing experiment, which provides a new calculation method and theoretical basis for ultra-fast laser machining of air film holes in aviation turbine blades, and has certain practical guiding significance for laser machining.",

This paper investigates the application of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)—two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms—for the learning and optimization of pick-and-place actions within HRC scenarios. By leveraging SAC’s capability to balance exploration and exploitation, the robot autonomously learns to perform pick-and-place tasks while adapting to dynamic environments and human interactions. Moreover, the integration of CQL ensures more stable learning by mitigating Q-value overestimation, which proves particularly advantageous in offline and suboptimal data scenarios. The combined use of CQL and SAC enhances policy robustness, facilitating safer and more efficient decision-making in continually evolving environments. The proposed framework combines simulation-based training with transfer learning techniques, enabling seamless deployment in real-world environments. The critical challenge of trajectory completion is addressed through a meticulously designed reward function that promotes efficiency, precision, and safety. Experimental validation demonstrates a 100 % success rate in simulation and an 80 % success rate on real hardware, confirming the practical viability of the proposed model. This work underscores the pivotal role of DRL in enhancing the functionality of collaborative robotic systems, illustrating its applicability across a range of industrial environments.",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear and high-dimensional nature of the impact factors affecting the production quality of aerospace products represents a major difficulty for the quality control in the aerospace industry. To obtain the impact factors affecting the product quality, it is plausible to perform dimensionality reduction on acquired samples before further manipulation. In this work, the isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) algorithm of stream learning is employed to perform nonlinear dimensionality reduction on aerospace data. This enables a calculation of the correlation coefficients between the principal components after dimensionality reduction and the original factors, the classification of the correspondence, and the ranking of the principal components according to their degree of influence. The experimental results show that the algorithm is able to carry out correlation analysis of 17 factors affecting the production quality of aerospace products, and analyze the 13 main factors affecting the production quality of aerospace products, and the degree of influence, in descending order, are the rationality of measurement methods, the rationality of test point design, tool wear, equipment normalization rate, the degree of equipment aging, the rationality of program design, the degree of material defects, the rationality of process route design, the rationality of tooling design, the technical level of personnel, the level of personnel experience, the personnel work status, and operational standardization. The ISOMAP algorithm was used to reduce the dimensionality of these 13 factors to form and rank the six main influence components, thus eliminating redundant factors, highlighting main influence features and extracting the intrinsic relation in data. The data analysis conclusions can facilitate a prevention of potential quality issues in aerospace production. To ensure the enhancement of the quality of aerospace product production, it is recommended that standard automated measurement methods be employed wherever feasible. Additionally, it is recommended that the regular maintenance of machining tools and equipment be strengthened to ensure that the machining tools and equipment are in perfect condition.",

However, in a complex and competitive supply chain environment, food companies face critical operational management challenges in selecting appropriate blockchain R&amp;D approaches and determining optimal R&amp;D levels. This study examines two competing food companies deciding on their optimal food production and blockchain R&amp;D levels. We first established a benchmark model without blockchain adoption. Then, we constructed supply chain operation models for both independent and collaborative blockchain R&amp;D scenarios. By comparing equilibrium decisions across different models, we derived the optimal blockchain R&amp;D model and operational strategies in food supply chains. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to consider asymmetric food substitution scenarios. Our findings revealed that independent blockchain R&amp;D tends to increase equilibrium food production and is more suitable for premium food supply chains. Conversely, collaborative blockchain R&amp;D significantly enhanced overall supply chain profitability. As spillover effects increase, food companies are likely to favor independent blockchain R&amp;D to achieve higher R&amp;D levels and stronger market competitiveness. Additionally, we demonstrated that blockchain R&amp;D levels are influenced by food substitutability and quality credibility.",

Drawing on a sample of 300 manufacturing firms, this study examines both the net and configurational effects of supply chain governance mechanisms and dynamic digital capabilities on supply chain resilience. Using structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the findings reveal that: Contractual governance, relational governance, digital sensing capability, digital resource integration, digital-driven innovation, and digital-enabled business capabilities each have a positive impact on manufacturing supply chain resilience. In the overall sample, only relational governance demonstrates a relatively strong individual effect, while none of the six governance or digital capability dimensions serve as necessary conditions for high resilience in subsample analyses. For high-tech manufacturing firms, two resilient configurations are identified: 1) basic digital enablement with strong governance synergy, and 2) advanced digital enablement with strong governance synergy. In contrast, non-high-tech firms exhibit three distinct resilient configurations: 1) digital integration–driven, 2 advanced digital enablement with relational governance dominance, and 3) dual-core digital enablement with robust governance synergy. These insights provide nuanced theoretical contributions and practical implications for configuring governance and digital strategies to build sustainable supply chain resilience in the manufacturing sector.",

Depth of cut, spindle speed, stepover distance and feed rate have been considered as process variables of micro ball-end milling in experimental design.

Taguchi’s L9 (34) orthogonal array was chosen to design the experiments, whereas grey relational analysis (GRA) was utilized for the multi-objective optimization of the micro ball end milling process with minimum dimensional deviation and minimum arithmetic mean roughness as objective functions. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract principal components and identify the corresponding weights for performance characteristics. In order to determine the significance of micro-milling parameters on overall machining performance, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed.

Therefore, a six-storey prefabricated timber structure of a height of 15 m and with a regular floor-plan is analysed by a seismic excitation of ag = 0.225 · g with a strong asymmetrical position of transparent façade elements. Two structural solutions are analysed: a hybrid system combining CLT and Light Timber-Framed walls and a non-hybrid structure made entirely of CLT. In both cases, DSF elements are first considered non-resisting and later as racking-resisting bracing elements. Numerical results show that using racking-resisting DSF elements in a hybrid system (CLT+LTF) achieves a similar increase in overall racking stiffness as a non-hybrid CLT structure with non-resisting DSF. Previous studies highlight hybrid timber systems as the preferred approach due to structural, energy-efficient, and ecological advantages. This finding is significant, offering practical benefits and new design opportunities for modern tall timber buildings with asymmetrical transparent façades, improving both energy efficiency and interior illumination in contemporary prefabricated structures.",

To fill this gap, this paper presents a closed-loop model of WLC incorporating feedback control and shop floor input-output control. The bond graphs’ dynamic modelling technique is employed. The model is implemented in Simulink® and its behaviour in face of disturbances is analysed. The load of the machines and of the job pool of WLC is considered to adjust order release (input control). The capacity of each machine (output control) is altered in function of the level of its preceding buffer. The machines’ processing rates stabilize and the reference levels for the buffers are reached when a step disturbance in order entry is simulated. Also, the system responded with a maximum capacity increment of 15 % when cyclic demand is simulated. This novel approach of a smart production control system can help managers to better control shop floor load in response to disturbances.",

This paper redefines the model's foundational structure by advocating for the recognition of the Discovery Phase as Stage 1, emphasizing its essential role in aligning initial ideation with strategic goals, streamlining processes, and enhancing NPD efforts. Using a mixed-methods approach, including a systematic literature review, synthesis of illustrative examples and secondary data and case study analysis, the research demonstrates that formalizing the Discovery Phase improves early-stage decision-making, enhances alignment between front-end exploration and downstream execution and mitigates risks by supporting more informed project development. Synthesised sectoral examples show that incorporating the Discovery Phase improves feasibility, reduces risk, and boosts efficiency. For example, simulation planning early in innovation process increased manufacturing throughput by 52 %, while early IP checks lowered infringement risk. The proposed revision boosts the Stage-Gate® model's adaptability and integration with modern methodologies such as AI, Agile, Lean Startup, Design Thinking and TRIZ.

    "abstract": "Optimizing the multimodal transport route for vehicles is crucial for reducing costs, enhancing efficiency, and minimizing emissions in the vehicle logistics industry. This study addresses several operational challenges, including seasonal fluctuations in vehicle sales, the scheduling of transportation modes, and client-specific order timing requirements. This paper presents a 0-1 integer programming model under carbon trading policy considering the timetable limit, with the objective of minimizing the aggregate costs of transportation, transshipment, short-term storage, time-window penalties, and carbon emissions. A linear weight reduction technique is employed to formulate the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm with dynamic inertia weights for model resolution. The model and algorithm's efficacy are validated by a real-world case study of multi-modal transport in China. The results reveal that the IPSO algorithm reduced convergence times by 30.38 % and 17.78 % in off-season and peak season data, respectively, compared to the traditional PSO algorithm. Additionally, the optimized multimodal transport solution reduced unit costs by 19.3 % and 14.8 %, respectively. The findings indicate that transport time-liness significantly influences optimal route selection. Factors such as extended short-term storage duration, missed shipping schedules, and expedited orders compel multimodal transport to shift toward road transport. An increase in carbon trading prices effectively encourages a shift from road transport to multimodal transport; however, excessively high carbon trading prices fail to regulate this transition. Furthermore, as transport distance increases, the transport costs and carbon emission advantages associated with multimodal transport also increase correspondingly. This research advances multimodal logistics by integrating seasonal variations and carbon trading into a novel optimization framework.",

    "abstract": "Wood processing remains a manufacturing field that relies heavily on craftsmanship and the experience of skilled workers. Although Computer Numerical Control (CNC) techniques have introduced significant progress in wood manufacturing, one of the main challenges remains the natural variability of wood. Variations in grain direction, density, moisture content, and other wood properties can result in inconsistent cutting behavior, increased surface roughness, and dimensional inaccuracies. Furthermore, the growing need to conserve natural resources continuously drives innovation in wood processing. This paper investigates CNC machining of hardwoods with a particular focus on evaluating surface roughness as a key quality parameter. Aiming to achieve better surface roughness leads to eliminating or reducing sanding operations. Cutting conditions, tool path optimization, and time efficiency during hardwood processing remain crucial factors in the furniture industry. Finished wooden components are typically assembled from multiple pieces using joining techniques; however, unlike in the forestry industry, the quality of the prepared samples is not systematically monitored and is often assessed solely by human judgment. Consequently, the impact of variable parameters, such as feed speed, timber species, fiber orientation, during the cutting and workpiece preparation was evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis. The study of milling curvilinear shapes in hardwoods (ash, oak, walnut) revealed that the annual growth ring section is the most significant factor affecting the quality of the finished product. Consequently, the adapted tool path according to the materials growth ring section would be advantageous while milling curvilinear shapes of the hardwood materials.",

    "abstract": "In response to the increasing frequency of natural disasters globally, and particularly in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, this study aims to optimize the site selection for emergency supplies storage facilities. Traditional methods for predicting emergency supplies demand rely heavily on expert judgment, lacking sophisticated forecasting methodologies, which further complicates research due to the inherent unpredictability of natural disasters. This paper adopts a multi-objective programming approach, leveraging historical data and the proposed emergency supplies demand model to systematically address the spatial layout planning problem of emergency material reserve nodes. After comprehensively considering various factors, including risk, economic, and time-related aspects, a 0-1 integer programming model was established, aiming to fulfill all regional requirements for essential resources within minimal rescue timeframes while minimizing overall costs. Through the application of the AHP-Entropy weight method, data standardization and indicator weighting were conducted, resulting in a hierarchical site selection framework that ensures timely emergency response across the region without incurring prohibitive costs. This study represents a significant contribution to the literature by focusing on the unique challenges and requirements of Guangxi and proposing a tailored approach to optimizing the site selection and layout of emergency supplies storage facilities, thereby enhancing disaster preparedness and response strategies effectively.",

    "abstract": "With the intensification of China’s aging society, improving the health management and emergency response capabilities of the elderly at home has become an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. To meet this challenge, an Emergency Home Monitoring System (EHMS) that utilizes real-time data and wearable device monitoring is developed to optimize the Emergency Medical Transport Vehicle and Hospital Scheduling Problem (EMTVHSP) for elderly people at home. The patient's condition classification and waiting time are effectively combined to establish an Emergency Medical Transport Vehicle and Hospital Scheduling Model (EMTVHSM). Specifically, the optimization objective of the model is to minimize the maximum rescue time, thereby improving the allocation efficiency of medical resources and the efficiency of patient transfer. To solve this model, an Improved Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (IQPSO) is proposed. The algorithm significantly improves the ability to solve complex scheduling problems by introducing neighborhood structure, improving constraint processing, introducing mutation operations and designing innovative resource reallocation strategies. Simulation results show that the dynamic resource scheduling method based on the IQPSO has significant advantages over traditional algorithms in reducing the maximum patient transfer time and improving scheduling efficiency and the optimization effect is improved by an average of 6.1 %. The emergency home monitoring system, scheduling model, and optimization algorithm designed effectively provide a more efficient emergency medical resource scheduling solution for elderly people at home and offer strong technical support and a practical basis for addressing health management challenges in an aging society.",

    "abstract": "Unlike mass-volume products, custom-made products provide multiple options at the ordering stage and therefore require a system flexible enough to accommodate these needs. This study developed a worker-balancing algorithm for custom-made products that enable equitable workload distribution across different numbers of workers. The key variables considered are task duration, the number of workers, and the type and complexity of the tasks involved in producing custom-made garments. The proposed algorithm is designed as an optimized production assignment by sequentially assigning the number of workers and tasks for each production operation. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows: (1) calculate the basic pitch time (BPT); (2) determine the number of workers and the time per worker required for the highest-level task; and (3) redistribute the workload between the highest-level task and the second-highest-level task. The algorithm was applied to generate production assignments for scenarios involving four to seven workers. The outcomes of the proposed method were compared with the current five-worker assignment in use. The results show that balance efficiency increased from 69.9 % to 83 %. To further validate the algorithm, a production process was modelled and simulated using a discrete-event systems simulation tool. The simulation confirmed the reliability of the balance efficiency, as labour utilization closely matched the calculated balance efficiency. This study is significant because it addresses work-load balancing in small-scale, custom-made garment production. Moreover, it offers a practical approach to distributing task durations that accounts for both worker competencies and the specific nature of the tasks performed.",

This technique addresses situations where the necessary training and test data are unavailable or where data acquisition is costly, difficult, or impractical. Additionally, transfer learning significantly reduces training time compared to training from scratch. This study demonstrates the benefits of transfer learning in developing an end-of-line quality inspection system to produce brushless DC electric motors during preproduction. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, and AdaBoost classifiers were trained on a dataset of 10,000 instances from a mass-produced motor subtype (A). Knowledge in the form of hyperparameters and feature importance was transferred to classifiers for two preproduction subtypes (B and C), each with only 100 instances. The results show up to a 20 % improvement in classification accuracy and significantly lower misclassification costs when using transfer learning. The study highlights the importance of transfer learning as an effective approach for improving industrial classification tasks, especially in preproduction phases where datasets are typically small and imbalanced.",

Previously, G-code was generated either by hand or through the use of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software along with machine-specific post-processors, both of which may require considerable time and expense. This research aimed to assess the practicality and effectiveness of specific large language models (LLMs) in generating G-code. The assessment took place in three distinct phases on a sample component that required 3-axis machining. These phases included: (1) the self-generated production of G-code for the sample component, (2) the examination of the independently generated G-code in the CAM application, and (3) the recognition and justification of mistakes in the G-code. The outcomes indicated varying abilities with promising findings. This method could accelerate and possibly enhance manufacturing workflows by decreasing reliance on expensive CAM software and specialized knowledge.",

The experimental investigation was focused on forming forces measuring on the rolls and the deflections of roll stands due to the forming loads. The comparison and analysis of the obtained experimental results was performed for the majority roll stands. Based on the experimental results mathematical modelling of the forming a force‐roll load was performed by response surface methodology for different values of the input parameters of the process: material properties, sheet thickness, and sheet width. The defined force model and experimental research show insufficient energetic and technological utilization of the existing production line. After the conducted research in the production process a sheet thickness of up to 1.40 mm is used instead of 0.70 mm, and the utilization of the installed energy has increased from 20 % to 75 %. This is confirmed by the measured deformations of the roll stands and the energy consumption of the powered electric motor. Through realized modernization of the cold roll forming production line, 30 % higher productivity is achieved, which is a result of optimal number planning of roll forming stations and approximately the same load of all roll stands, as well as the higher flow rate of the profile sheet.",

A robust schedule ensures that the expected finish time is always less than the makespan. To use the global search ability of the evolution strategy (ES) and local search ability of Tabu Search (TS), a hybrid evolution strategy (HES) is proposed by combining Improved ES with TS to generate the robust schedules. The robust schedule is first generated using ES and then the solution is optimized using TS for maximum exploitation and exploration of the solution space. For maximum exploitation in ES, (1+9) reproduction operator and double swap mutation is used. Also variable mutation rate is used for fine tuning of the results. In TS, the length of Tabu list is fixed, also lower bound is used to save computational time. The hybrid algorithm is tested on Carlier and Reeves benchmark problems taken from the OR-library. Achieved results are compared with other famous techniques available in the literature, and the results show that HES performs better than other techniques and provides an affirmative percentage increase in the probability that the expected finish time is less than the makespan.",

    "abstract": "The manuscript presents the importance of integrating mathematical methods for the determination of due date optimization parameter for maturity optimization in evolutionary computation (EC) methods in multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP). The use of mathematical modelling methods of due date optimization with slack (SLK) for low and total work content (TWK) for medium and high dimensional problems was presented with the integration into the multi-objective heuristic Kalman algorithm (MOHKA). The multi-objective optimization results of makespan, machine utilization and due date scheduling with the MOHKA algorithm were compared with two comparative multi-objective algorithms. The high capability and dominance of the EC method results in scheduling jobs for FJSSP production was demonstrated by comparing the optimization results with the results of scheduling according to conventional priority rules. The obtained results of randomly generated datasets proved the high level of job scheduling importance with respect to the interdependence of the optimization parameters. The ability to apply the presented method to the real-world environment was demonstrated by using a real-world manufacturing system dataset applied in Simio simulation and scheduling software. The optimization results prove the importance of the due date optimization parameter in highly dynamic FJSSP when it comes to achieving low numbers of tardy jobs, short job tardiness and potentially lower tardy jobs costs in relation to short makespan of orders with highly utilized production capacities. The main findings prove that multi-objective optimization of FJSSP planning and scheduling, taking into account the optimization parameter due date, is the key to achieving a financially and timely sustainable production system that is competitive in the global market.",

    "abstract": "High-speed machining (HSM) maintains a high interest in the preparation of metal parts for optimum results, but with the application of HSM, the sustainability issue becomes important. To overcome the problem, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) during HSM is one of the innovative and challenging tasks during conventional cutting (milling) to improve quality, productivity, and strength under the umbrella of sustainability. The objective of this research is to achieve sustainable machining by simultaneously optimizing sustainable machining drivers during the HSM of 15CDV6 HSLA steel under MQL and flood lubrication. The response surface methodology has been applied for the development of mathematical models and selecting the best combination of process parameters to optimized responses, i.e. surface roughness, material removal rate, and strength. Optimization associated with sustainability produced compromising optimal results (Min. Ra 0.131 µm, Max. MRR 0.64 cm3/min, and Max. ST 1132 MPa) at the highest cutting speed 270 m/min and the lowest feed rate 0.09 mm/rev and depth of cut 0.15 mm under MQL. The comparative investigation exposed that significant improvement in Ra (1.1-16.6 %) and ST (1.3-2.3 %) of the material using MQL has been witnessed and gives a strong indication that MQL is the best substitute than the flood lubrication. The scientific contribution of the approach is to develop mathematical models under MQL and flood lubrication that will aid practitioners to choose input parameters for desired responses without experimentations. The work would be beneficial in the field of aviation, defense, and aeronautical applications due to the excellent mechanical properties of 15CDV6 HSLA steel.",

The first method is based on the kinematical-geometrical copying of the cutting tool geometry onto the machined surface including a feedback loop through the parameter of statistic equality of sampling lengths in surface roughness measurements (SE). The other method employs the Design of Experiments (DOE) principles expressing the roughness parameters as first order nonlinear function of the input variables: cutting speed v, feed f, depth of cut ap, and tool nose radius rε. The research includes the Ra and Rz roughness parameters which are commonly modelled throughout the research works, and additionally develops models for the Rp, Rv and Rmr(c) roughness parameters which are more challenging to model compared to Ra and Rz as they depend more on the shape of the roughness profile and position of its mean line. Both methodologies for all roughness parameters were verified using a CNC lathe and special rings made of steel EN C55 with hardness of 53±1 HRC. Considering that the roughness profile is just a part of the total geometric deviations of the processed surfaces, and it is obtained from the total profile using software filtration, the research also considers the Wa parameter (waviness profile), as well as the deviations from the circularity (out-off-roundness) of the processed rings as indicators for the stability of the machining process.",

AuNPs were collected in suspensions of deionised (D.I.) water with the stabilisers polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG), followed by the process of freeze drying the AuNPs to be useful as a new additive for the cream. The standard cream base was used as a matrix for preparation of three types of cream with AuNPs in the same concentration ratios.

The results of the study found improvements of collagen quality between 18-24 %, achieved due to the use of AuNPs in standard creams, while the cream with the combination of 3HFWC-W and AuNPs gave significantly higher improvements with a value of 45.7 %. It was also discovered that hydration of the skin (stratum cornum) increased by 6.4-9.6 % in standard creams with AuNPs, and 73.7 % in the 3HFWC/AuNPs` cream.

This study investigates agricultural supply chain coordination contracts in the presence of output uncertainty. It considers a two-level supply chain comprising a farmer and a retailer, where the farmer faces capital constraints and shows stockout-averse (SA), waste-averse (WA), or stock-out- and waste-averse (SW) preferences. The results show that the retailer order, production input, and supply chain expected utility in the decentralized decision framework are lower than those realized under the centralized decision model; hence, the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. Nevertheless, the designed coordination contract mechanism coordinates the supply chain efficiently and realizes a flexible distribution of benefits between the farmer and the retailer. Furthermore, when the revenue-sharing coefficient meets specific conditions, both the farmer and the retailer achieve a win-win situation. Finally, we verify the coordination contract design using numerical simulations and analyze the effects of SA and WA preferences on decision-making and the supply chain expected utility. This study provides theoretical guidance for the coordination mechanism design of agricultural supply chain with capital constraints and behavioral preferences.",

The preliminary investigation presented in this paper focuses on the identification of the Quality 4.0 readiness level of organizations operating in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia, as well as affecting factors. The study is based on the review of relevant literature. The web-based questionnaire enabling organizations' representatives through Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) to take part in the study was used. Data from 298 completed responses were subjected to comprehensive analysis. Descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing were applied to analyse the data. Small and medium-sized organizations achieve low levels of Quality 4.0 readiness. Large organizations are better prepared. The study confirmed the dependence between the Quality 4.0 readiness level and whether the organization operates in automotive, while automotive organizations achieved a higher level of Quality 4.0 readiness than other organizations. The significant relationship between the Quality 4.0 readiness level and whether the organization has a certified management system was also confirmed. Received data also enabled the identification of the main barriers and benefits of Quality 4.0 implementation perceived by the organizations. The research findings identify the challenges that enterprises face regarding the Quality 4.0 implementation and the necessary support that organizations require. These findings can be a foundation for developing novel research initiatives and implementation programs. The research results contribute to the existing body of knowledge and bring new information and insights into the field of quality digitalization.",

It is crucial to pay serious attention to the maintenance and application of Solar Power Generation (SPG) to harness it effectively. The design was more costly, and the automatic monitoring is not precise. The main objective of the work related to designed and built up the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to monitor the SPV Power Plants (SPVPP) to solve the issue. IoT platform designing and Data Analytics (DA) are the two phases of the proposed methodology. For building the IoT device in the IoT platform designing phase, diverse lower-cost sensors with higher end-to-end delivery ratio, higher network lifetime, throughput, residual energy, and better energy consumption are considered. Then, Sigfox communication technology is employed at the Low-Power Wireless Area Network (LPWAN) communication layer for lower-cost communication. Therefore, in the DA phase, the sensor monitored values are evaluated. In the analysis phase, which is the most significant part of the work, the input data are first pre-processed to avoid errors. Next, to monitor the Energy Loss (EL), the fault, and Potential Energy (PE), the solar features are extracted as of the pre-processed data. The significance of utilizing the Transformation Search centered Seagull Optimization (TSSO) algorithm, the significant features are chosen as of the extracted features. Therefore, the computational time of the solar monitoring has been decreased by the Feature Selection (FS). Next, the features are input into the Gaussian Kernelized Deep Learning Neural Network (GKDLNN) algorithm, which predicts the faults, PE, and EL. In the experimental evaluation, solar generation is assessed based on Wind Speed (WS), temperature, time, and Global Solar Radiation (GSR). The systems are satisfactory and produce more power during the time interval from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated based on performance metrics and compared with existing research techniques.

Similar high sophisticated systems are commercially available but in most cases they are very expensive and so their purchase is economically unjustified. The purpose of our research is to develop an inexpensive system for non-contact determination of the workpiece origin, which is also sufficiently precise for practical use. The system is implemented on a three-axis CNC milling machine Lakos 150 G, which is primarily designed for good machinability materials. Calibration procedure using feed-forward neural networks was developed. With this method the calibration procedure is simplified and the mathematical derivation of camera model is avoided. Learned neural network represents the camera calibration model. After neural network learning is complete, we can begin using the system for determining the workpiece origin. This developed system was through a number of tests proved to be reliable and suitable for use in practice. In the paper, working of system is illustrated with a practical example, which confirms the effectiveness of the implemented system in actual use on machine.",

    "abstract": "Refined layout is a basis of warehousing efficiency. Straight aisle is a typical feature of current warehouse internal layouts. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using curve aisles for warehouse layout. By Choosing typical non-traditional layouts and transforming their inclined cross-aisle trajectory into parabola, two parabolic aisle layouts, parabolic Flying-V and parabolic Fishbone, are constructed. For unit-load warehouses, based on the morphological characteristic analysis and the parabolic types selection, the picking distance model and the cross-aisle length formula are presented. Interval Numerical Simulation Method (INSM) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are adopted to solve the model respectively in order to verify the results. This research breaks through the realistic situation of straight aisle leading warehouse layout, and enriches the relevant layout theory. The calculation results of 100 warehouses with different sizes show that the picking distance of parabolic Flying-V could be reduced by 0.22-0.62 % compared with the straight layout, and the theoretical possible improvement space has been compressed by 2.42-12.26 %. Its length of cross-aisle is shortened by -0.03-3.10 %. The picking distance of parabolic Fishbone could be only reduced by 0.02-0.04 %. The theoretical possible improvement space has been compressed by 1.27-1.83 %. But its length of cross-aisle will increase by 4.63-19.50 % significantly. We believe that the layout of non-rectangular complex special-shaped warehouses based on curve trajectory aisles would become an important research topic. In addition, after some necessary modifications to the objectives and constraints, the proposed method in this paper may also be used for the arrangement of machines and devices in a workshop in principle.",

Its essence is to support medium-term decisions regarding the development of the production system through economic assessment of potential change scenarios. It has been assumed that the developed methodology should be adapted to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to their flexibility, they usually have limited time for decision-making, and due to limited financial resources, they rely on internal competencies. The proposed approach that does not require mastery of mathematical modelling but allows streamlining capacity planning decisions. It uses the reasoning of throughput accounting (TA) supported by data obtained based on discrete event simulation (DES). Using these related tools in the design and analysis of change scenarios, make it possible for SME managers to make a rational decision regarding the development of the production system. Case studies conducted in a roof window manufacturing company showed the methodology. The application example presented in the article includes seven change scenarios analyzed based on computer simulations by the software Tecnomatix Plant Simulation. The implementation of the approach under real conditions has shown that a rational decision-making process is possible over time scale and with the resources available to SMEs for this type of decision.",

A framework for enhancing production systems with ML facilitates the transition to smarter processes and enables fast, accurate predictions integrated into decision-making and adaptive control. Comparative ML analysis provides insights into predictive regression models for hydraulic press condition recognition, enhancing process improvement. Our results are supported by performance evaluation metrics of predictive accuracy RMSE, MAE, MSE and R2 for Linear Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Neural Network (NN) models. Given the remarkable predictive accuracy of the regression models with R2 values between 0.9483 and 0.9995, it is noteworthy that less complex models exhibit significantly shorter training times, up to 437 times shorter than more complex models. In addition, simpler models have up to 36 times better prediction rates, compared to more complex models.

    "abstract": "The accumulation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become a critical global issue. E-commerce platforms offer new opportunities for WEEE recycling, making it a subject of interest for researchers. This study focuses on the E-commerce Closed-Loop Supply Chain (E-CLSC) WEEE recycling system, led by remanufacturers, and develops a dual-sided evolutionary game model with remanufacturers and platforms as participants. The model considers the influence of factors such as green innovation, service level, recycling price, and government subsidies. A profit matrix is constructed to analyze the strategic choices of remanufacturers and platforms. Then, this paper conducts a simulation using MATLAB, obtaining data based on the sales and recycling prices of smartphones. Based on evolutionary numerical analysis, the following findings were obtained: (1) Government subsidy policies are formulated based on the required investments for green innovation and service levels, which differ at each stage. (2) The decision of whether remanufacturers engage in green innovation depends largely on the extent to which the technology can reduce remanufacturing costs. They are more inclined to choose green innovation if it can significantly lower costs. (3) Consumer sensitivity to recycling prices also influences the strategic choices of remanufacturers. The more sensitive consumers are to prices, the more waste products remanufacturers can recycle, making green innovation more attractive.",

    "abstract": "With the growth of industrialization, the global manufacturing industry is continually evolving and reforming in the direction of intelligence and green production. Industrial robots have replaced human workers because of the benefit of production efficiency. However, the large-scale application of robots requires a large amount of energy consumption and generates a large amount of CO2, which will lead to energy waste and environmental pollution. In addition, in term of performing some particular tasks, current robot technology cannot achieve the same level of intelligence as human. Therefore, the design trend of assembly lines in industry has shifted from traditional configuration to human-robot collaboration to achieve higher productivity and flexibility. This paper investigates the human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly line balancing problem, taking cycle time and carbon emission as primary and secondary objectives. A new mixed-integer programming model that features a cross-station design is formulated. A particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with two improvement rules is designed to solve the problems. The comparative experiments on ten benchmark datasets are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the improved particle swarm algorithm is superior to the other two heuristics: simulated annealing (SA) and the late acceptance hill-climbing heuristic (LAHC).",

    "abstract": "In the context of the economic globalization, there is an increased disruption risk in the supply chain network due to the outsourcing, complexity and uncertainty. At the same time, the disruption may propagate across the entire supply chain network because of the interdependence. With the resource constraints, appropriate recovery strategies which can minimize the impact of disruption propagation and effectively improve the supply chain network resilience have attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper, we first construct the disruption propagation model considering the recovery strategy based on the characteristics of the competitiveness, time delay and underload cascading failure in the supply chain network. This model uses the memetic algorithm to determine the set of recovery nodes among all disruption nodes, which can minimize the impact of disruption propagation. And then, the simulation analysis is conducted on the synthetic network and the real-world supply chain network. We compare the proposed recovery strategy with other strategies (according to the genetic algorithm, according to the descending order of the load of failure node, according to the ascending order of the load of failure node, according to the descending order of the node degree, according to the ascending order of the node degree) and provide decision-making reference against supply chain disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Consistently maintaining high-end product quality in the production process is challenging. End-quality inspection must be highly sensitive to detect even minimal deviations, while being fast and accurate. However, quality inspection systems often face calibration intricacies, are time-consuming, and rely heavily on expert knowledge. They handle substantial data flows and inspect numerous features, some of which contribute minimally to the final grade. To address these challenges, the paper proposes employing statistically supervised machine learning methods for classification. Decision trees, Random forests, Bagging, and Gradient boosting classifiers are recommended for feature selection and accurate diagnosis, particularly for electric motor classification. By utilizing the feature importance attribute for feature selection, the proposed approach compares model accuracies, reducing rampup and commission times significantly. The study found that all suggested classifiers achieved high accuracy in classifying electric motors in end-of-line quality inspection system. Moreover, they effectively reduced the number of features and optimize database operations. Utilizing a reduced feature set streamlined diagnostic algorithms, accelerated learning, and improved model interpretability, enhancing overall efficiency and comprehension. Furthermore, analysing the feature importance attribute could simplify diagnostic hardware and expedite quality inspection by eliminating unnecessary steps. Newly generated models can also verify expert decisions on feature selection and limit adjustments, enhancing efficiency in production processes.",

    "abstract": "In the current quality paradigm, the performance of a product is kept within specification by ensuring that its parts are within specification. Product performance is then validated after final assembly. However, this does not control how robust the product performance is, i.e. how much it will vary between the specification limits. In this paper, a model for predicting product performance is proposed, taking into account design, assembly and process parameters live from production. This empowers production to maintain final product performance, instead of part quality. The PRECI‐IN case study is used to demonstrate how the monitoring system can be used to efficiently guide corrective action to improve product performance. It is claimed that the monitoring system can be used to dramatically cut the time taken to identify, planand execute corrective action related to typical quality issues. To substantiate this claim, two further cases comparable to PRECI‐IN, in terms of complexity, material and manufacturing process, were taken from different industries.The interviews with quality experts revealed that the typical time taken for corrective action for both cases was accounted to be seven days. Using the monitoring system for the PRECI‐IN case, similar corrective action would have been achieved almost immediately.",

The globalisation of supply chains and the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) mean that companies must be more agile and resilient to adapt to volatile demand, and to improve their relation with customers and suppliers. Hence the growing interest in coordinating production-distribution processes in supply chains. To deal with the new market’s requirements and to adapt business processes to industry’s regulations and changing conditions, more efforts should be made towards new methods that optimise PDP processes. This paper proposes a matheuristic approach for solving the PDP problem. Given the complexity of this problem, combining a genetic algorithm and a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed. The matheuristic algorithm was tested using the Coin-OR Branch &amp; Cut open-source solver. The computational outcomes revealed that the presented matheuristic algorithm may be used to solve real sized problems.",

To study the impacts of both the retail price uncertainty risk and retail price risk aversion preference on supply chain (SC) decision-making, we constructed a SC game model based on three different power structures, including Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) game, Retailer Stackelberg (RS) game, and Vertical Nash (VN) game. The results showed that the retail price uncertainty risk and the retailer’s retail price risk aversion preference weakened the manufacturer’s production effort input, decreased the retailer’s enthusiasm for ordering, and damaged the interests of manufacturer and retailer. Under the three different power structures, the production effort input of the manufacturer depended on the production effort affecting wholesale price efficiency and retail price efficiency. The retailer’s expected utility was largest under the MS game model and smallest under the VN game model. The manufacturer’s profits were closely related to each parameter under the three respective power structures. This study provides theoretical guidance for the decision-making of SC enterprises with retail price risk and retailer with retail price risk aversion preference under different power structure situations.",

Optimizing machine and worker assignments to achieve maximum efficiency is a critical problem for workshop managers. This paper investigates a multi-objective dual-resource-constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem. An improved wild horse optimization (IWHO) algorithm is developed to simultaneously optimize three objectives: makespan, maximum machine workload, and total machine workload. To evaluate the quality of individuals in multi-objective optimization, the Pareto fast non-dominated sorting method is used, and the crowding distance is calculated. To update the algorithm's solution, the crossover and mutation operations are used. Further, a local neighborhood search strategy is employed to enhance searchability and avoid trapping into the local optima. The benchmark of the flexible job shop scheduling problem is extended to create test instances, and the performance of the suggested IWHO algorithm is evaluated compared with the NSGA-II. The computational results show that the IWHO algorithm provides a non-dominated efficient set within a reasonable running time. Furthermore, a buffers and chain coupler assembly process is designed to analyze the practical value of the IWHO algorithm. The proposed solutions can be used to generate daily schedules for managing machines, workers, and production cycles.",

    "abstract": "Today's world revolves around technology, which has a total impact not only on human life but also on manufacturing companies. Many companies have embraced artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of powerful computers, applications, or software that can screen job applicants, alert when a machine is about to break down, and read legal contracts. However, the rapid expansion of AI and its use in legal settings, such as contract performance, in a company is a major challenge on the judicial side. This article, thus, establishes an evolutionary game model of whether manufacturing suppliers are performing contracts or not when the court chooses to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Considering the complexity of choosing manufacturers' AI strategy, the method constructs a simulation analysis model of manufacturers' contract enforcement behaviour with the participation of several subjects. We can simulate the influence of the factors selected on the strategy chosen by both parties (manufacturers and court) by changing the different influence factors and studying the evolutionary law of different court guidance and regulation strategies on the production behaviour of green products. The results show that the choice of the court and manufacturers to use the AI technology strategy or not is based on the rate of error reduction, through the computational implementation of multi-subject modelling.",

There are several Digital Maturity models that help companies to develop their digital roadmaps, however, none of them have been developed for Research and Development (R&amp;D) organisations. Additionally, none of these models include the dimension of sustainability. In this paper the authors used the Means-End Chain method to determine which are the key dimensions of the digital maturity model tailored for R&amp;D, as well as to investigate the link between digital transformation and sustainability. The results show that although technologies are important, they cannot successfully transform the organisation on their own. They must be supported by people and culture change. The results also highlighted that sustainability is high on the agenda and cannot be ignored when progressing towards the higher level of Digital Maturity. The findings may serve as a reference for any organisation that is building or revising its digitalisation or sustainability strategies. It highlights the important dimensions that should be considered and prioritised when preparing the transformation roadmap. These dimensions are tailored for R&amp;D but can be a good indication for any other type of organisation.",

The existing research of product quality prediction faces several major problems: the lack of diverse quality features, the poor tractability of abnormal parameters, the strong nonlinearity of parameters, the obvious sequential property of data, and the severe time lag of data. To solve these problems, this paper explores the quality prediction and control of multistage MP process (MPMP) based on big data analysis. Firstly, the prediction strategy and flow were specified for MPMP product quality prediction, and the features were extracted from MPMP product quality. After that, the MPMP product quality features were described in multiple dimensions, the attention mechanism was introduced to the prediction process. In addition, the recurrent neural network was improved, and an MPMP product quality prediction model was established on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. Our model was compared with AdaBoost and XGBoost through experiments. The effectiveness of our model was demonstrated by the results of the appearance quality PQ1, and the area under the curve (AUC) for each process parameter. In general, our model is superior to other algorithms in the accuracy, mean accuracy, and precision of product quality prediction.",

However, due to the high cost of real-world production verification, most literature did not verify the optimized scheduling scheme in real-world workshops. This paper studied the verification of scheduling schemes and environments, using a discrete event simulation (DES) platform. The aim of this study is to provide an efficient way to verify the correctness of scheduling environments established by programming languages and scheduling results obtained by intelligent algorithms. The system architecture of scheduling verification based on DES is established. The modelling approach via DES is proposed by designing parametric workshop generation, flexible production control, and real-time data processing. The popular distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem is selected as a case study, where the optimal scheduling scheme obtained by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is fed into the production simulation model in Plant Simulation software. The experiment results show that the proposed scheduling verification approach can validate the scheduling scheme and environment effectively. The utilization and Gantt charts clearly show the performance of scheduling schemes. This work can help to verify the scheduling schemes and programmed scheduling environment efficiently without costly real-world validation.",

    "abstract": "OEM production model can achieve an effective integration of internal and external resources, and the brand owner's brand premium and manufacturer's production advantage are the key elements of the model.When manufacturers have both OEM channels and direct sales, the competition and cooperation relationships between them and the brand owners become even more complicated when the hybrid channels exist.In order to better study the operation and management of the supply chains of OEM production with the hybrid channels, the operating conditions and optimization mechanism for the supply chain of OEM production with the hybrid channels were analyzed under both a centralized and decentralized decision making scenarios through the construction of a two-stage closed-loop supply chain model involving both manufacturers and brand owners.We found that the existence of hybrid channel depends on the brand owner's premium level which is limited by the manufacturer's production costs.There is a section on the premium level of brand owner and the hybrid channel exists in both a decentralized and a centralized decision making paradigms.By optimizing manufacturers' production costs and brand owner's premium level, the profits of both parties involved in the supply chain of OEM production with the hybrid channels, as well as the general profit of the system, can be improved.The system profit under a centralized decision making scenario is greater than that of a decentralized case.If the redistribution is made for the increase in the optimized system profit by leveraging the profit stratified ratio of OEM channels of a decentralized decision making approach, then there is a possibility of achieving the Pareto optimization.",

The production of customized goods poses new challenges for all areas of functioning of production systems.

The article presents research carried out in the SmartFactory laboratory of the Poznań University of Technology regarding the impact of the structure of products (customization) on the realization of current production orders. The research was carried out using the FlexSim simulation environment. Based on simulation experiments for three forms of organization of production flow with varying degrees of flexibility of production resources, an analysis was made of the time of execution of various sets of production orders and the level of use of available working time. The results of research indicate that in the production of products with low and high planned labor consumption, the use of universal production station is the most advantageous. For such a solution, the degree of utilization of the available working time of production stations is also the highest. It was also found that the principles of scheduling production orders affect the effectiveness of the production system. The best results were obtained for the production schedule, where the sequence of production orders was established from the lowest planned time of resource loading.",

Control parameters like electrolyte concentration, voltage, depth of cut and electrolyte flow rate have been considered to ensure two conflicting responses – higher material removal rate and lower surface roughness simultaneously by a single parametric combination. The L9 orthogonal array design is followed for the purpose of experimentation. The well-known S/N ratio analysis is performed along with ANOVA to establish the prominent variables that govern the responses separately. Finally Grey Relational Analysis is performed to optimize multiple performances in which different levels combinations of the factors are ranked based on grey relational grade. Surface roughness is given more importance than the MRR considering basic objective of the process. The analysis reveals that substantial improvement in machining performance takes place following this technique. The experimental investigation approach for evaluating the optimum ECG parametric combination during machining of composites materials can act as useful and an efficient guideline for manufacturing of products using such material.

    "abstract": "To remain competitive in this global market, time to time organizations must decide about some strategic issues, future course of action and implementation strategies.Group decision making is always better than individual decisions as group talent is more than that of any individual.The main purpose of this paper is to represent a group decision making model considering the preference of individual participants.In real life, decision making processes are based on Yes-No voting system, which may not reflect the decision makers real intention.This paper deals with a case study of strategic decision making for an organization with the help of Analytic hierarchy process based group decision making model considering preference intensity of individual voters.The final decision is taken based on the ratio of benefit from particular criteria to cost and associated risk involved on that particular criterion.It is observed that this model takes care of objective as well as subjective criteria simultaneously.One possible limitation is that all the alternatives may become unsuitable in a particular case.This model is easy to apply as it is based on traditional Analytic hierarchy process method.This methodology can be used in any kind of societal selection process.",

We find that TCF is an equilibrium financing choice for a capital-constrained supply chain. However, when a capital-constrained member chooses TCF, sharing demand information over the supply chain becomes more difficult. The interactions between the choices of financing approach and information sharing based on the game equilibriums, as well as the conditions that encourage the well-funded member to offer TCF in the capital-constrained supply chains, have also been analytically explored and numerically verified.

    "abstract": "This article presents the design and development of a flexible tooling system for sheet metal bending. The flexible tooling system aims to reduce manufacturing disturbances and increase the efficiency of the forming process. First and foremost, the structural behaviour of the sheet metal is investigated using the finite element method for the numerical simulation of the three-point bending process. The analysis’ findings enabled the prediction of component reaction to loads, which are essential for the further optimization and enhancement of the tooling system’s flexibility. At the initial stage of the development phase, SolidWorks, the computer-aided design software, is utilized to visualise the flexible tooling system and improve the tooling connectivity design. Furthermore, the prototype is developed by integrating mechanical and electrical components, such as the Arduino Mega microcontroller, stepper motors, and digital stepper drivers. Automation is achieved by programming the Arduino microcontroller board and controlling the stepper motors’ movement to ensure precise displacement and speed control of the forming tools. The tooling system’s major qualities are its high flexibility, achieved through the implementation of two moveable support cylinders and the possibility of being further upgraded to a closed-loop forming system. The higher level of automation and optimization of the sheet metal bending process can lead to improved processing efficiency and help achieve the desired formed products with higher quality and the required geometric tolerance. It is expected that the development of a flexible tooling system will find widespread application in sheet metal bending processes, resulting in reduced material costs, rapid equipment set-up and higher processing repeatability.",

The obtained values of Ra ranged from 0.13 μm to 4.39 μm. The results of the experiments showed that surface roughness improves with increasing corner radius, increasing approach angle, increasing rake angle, and decreasing inclination angle. Based on the experimental results, models were developed to predict the distribution of the arithmetical mean roughness using the response surface method (RSM), Gaussian process regression with two kernel functions, the sequential exponential function (GPR-SE) and Mattern (GPR-Mat), and decision tree regression (DTR). The maximum percentage errors of the developed models were 3.898 %, 1.192 %, 1.364 %, and 0.960 % for DTR, GPR-SE, GPR-Mat, and RSM, respectively. In the worst case, the maximum absolute errors were 0.106 μm, 0.017 μm, 0.019 μm, and 0.011 μm for DTR, GPR-SE, GPR-Mat, and RSM, respectively.

Secondly, the \"As is\" scenario analysis and a screening process are performed to extract significant input parameters as well as sensitive outputs of the model. The final step optimizes the performance of PSC. The proposed approach validity is appraised by being applied to the PSC of a leading pharmaceutical company in Jordan. As a result, the opportunity loss cost has considerably decreased for both the manufacturer and wholesalers’ echelons and the service level has improved throughout the PSC.",

    "abstract": "In response to the wide range of customer demands, the concept of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) was introduced in the industrial sector. RMS enables producers to meet varying volumes of demand over varying time periods by swiftly adjusting its production capacity and functionality within a part family in response to abrupt market changes. In these circumstances, RMS are made to swiftly reconfigure their Reconfigurable Machine Tools (RMTs). RMTs are designed to have a variety of configurations that may be conditionally chosen and reconfigured in accordance with specific performance goals. However, the reconfiguration process is not an easy process, which entails optimization of several objectives and many of which are inherently conflictual. As a result, it necessitates real-time monitoring of the RMS's condition, which may be achieved by digital twinning, or the real-time capture of system data. The concept of using a digital replica of a physical system to provide real-time optimization is known as digital twin. This work considered a case study of discrete parts manufacturing on a reconfigurable single manufacturing transfer line (SMTL). Six manufacturing operations are required to be performed on the parts at six production stages. This work uses the Digital Twin (DT) based approach to assist a discrete multi-objective optimization problem for a reconfigurable manufacturing transfer line. This multi-objective optimization problem consists of four objective functions which is illustrated by using DT-based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The innovative aspect of the current study is the use of a DT-based framework for RMS reconfiguration to produce the best optimum solutions. The produced real-time solutions will be of great assistance to the decision maker in selecting the appropriate real-time optimal solutions for reconfigurable manufacturing transfer lines.",

Among the most critical issues identified is the difficulty in optimising production performance (P3), with a GCI value of 16, implying that both time and cost share the same critical level. An analysis using a proposed Criticality Matrix was then performed enabling companies to prioritise decision-making and resource allocation. The results highlight the importance of adopting mass customisation strategies, innovative approaches and workflow optimisation. Continuous monitoring and analysis of criticality levels can also help ETO companies identify emerging issues and improve informed decisions. Effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders were also identified as vital. Future research could be done expanding further the study sample and developing decision-support tools for ETO manufacturing companies.

    "abstract": "To optimize urban logistics networks, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model for urban logistics distribution networks (ULDN). The model optimizes vehicle usage costs, transportation costs, penalty costs for failing to meet time windows, and carbon emission costs, while also considering the impact of urban road traffic congestion on total costs. To solve the model, a DPSO (Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm based on the basic principle of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) is proposed. The DPSO introduces multiple populations to handle multiple targets and uses a variable neighbourhood search strategy to improve the search ability of particles, which helps to improve the local search ability of the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in avoiding traffic congestion, reducing carbon emissions costs, and time penalty costs. The optimization comparison results between DPSO and PSO also verify the superiority of the DPSO algorithm.

    "abstract": "This study investigates a flow shop scheduling problem with queue time limits and skipping jobs, which are common scheduling requirements for semiconductor and printed circuit board manufacturing systems. These manufacturing systems involve the most complex processes, which are strictly controlled and constrained to manufacture high-quality products and satisfy dynamic customer orders. Further, queue times between consecutive stages are limited. Given that the queue times are limited, jobs must begin the next step within the maximum queue time after the jobs in the previous step are completed. In the considered flow shop, several jobs can skip the first step, referred to as skipping jobs. Skipping jobs exist because of multiple types of products processed in the same flow shop. For the considered flow shop, this paper proposes a mathematical programming formulation and a genetic algorithm to minimize the makespan. The GA demonstrated its strengths through comprehensive computational experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. As the problem size increased, the GA's performance improved noticeably, while maintaining acceptable computation times for real-world fab facilities. We also validated its performance in various scenarios involving queue time limits and skipping jobs, to further emphasize its capabilities.",

Using machine Learning-enhanced agent-based modeling and simulation, the study applies fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to model price decisions, and reinforcement learning and swarm intelligence to model consumer behavior. Simulations reveal that different learning behaviors result in different retailer competition patterns, and that supplier price competition affects the strength of retailer price competition. Simulation results demonstrate that consumer learning behavior influences retailer competition, with self-learning consumers leading to higher-priced partnerships, and collective-learning consumers leading to a shift in price competition among retailers. In contrast, perfect rationality consumers result in low-price competition and the lowest average margin and profit. Additionally, the competitive price behavior of suppliers impacts retailers' price competition patterns, with supplier price competition reducing retailer price competition in the perfect rationality consumer market and enhancing it in the self-learning and collective-learning consumer markets, leading to lower average prices and profits for retailers. This study presents a simulated market for price competition among suppliers, retailers, and consumers that can be expanded by subsequent scholars to test related hypotheses.",

The annual analysis shows that in the company higher importance should be given to non conformity process management. The company decided to reduce waste and improve selected process using Six sigma methodology. Although all corrective and preventive actions have been defined and performed in details in accordance to the Six sigma methodology the final results of performed intervention will be known not earlier than at next annual analysis. Regarding the fact that there is a lack of case studies dealing with Six sigma especially in individual manufacturing this article could be of great importance also for the practitioners.

In the present research, Titanium alloy has been machined by considering different electrical input parameters to evaluate one of the important surface integrity (SI) parameter that is surface roughness Ra. Firstly, the response surface methodology (RSM) has been adopted for experimental design and for generating training data set. The artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed and optimized for Ra with the same training data set. Finally, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model has been developed for Ra. Optimization of the developed ANFIS model has been done by applying the latest optimization techniques Rao algorithm and the Jaya algorithm. Different statistical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) elucidate that the ANFIS model is better than the ANN model. Both the optimization algorithms results in considerable improvement in the SI of the machined surface. Comparing the Rao algorithm and Jaya algorithm for optimization, it has been found that the Rao algorithm performs better than the Jaya algorithm.",

It integrates the variable neighbourhood algorithm to solve the multiple objective optimization of the mTSP with workload balance. Aiming to workload balance, the first design of this paper is about generating initial solutions based on the polar coordinate classification. Then a distance comparison insertion operator is designed as a neighbourhood action for allocating paths in a targeted manner. Finally, the neighbourhood descent process in the variable neighbourhood algorithm is fused into the genetic algorithm for the expansion of search space. The improved algorithm is tested on the TSPLIB standard data set and compared with other genetic algorithms. The results show that the improved genetic algorithm can increase computational efficiency and obtain a better solution for workload balance and this algorithm has wild applications in real life such as multiple robots task allocation, school bus routing problem and other optimization problems.",

Tensile-shear fatigue tests were performed to obtain the fatigue lives and the corresponding normalized S-N curves of spot-welded joints. Subsequently, the force acting at the spot-welded joints was obtained by extracting the force and moment of the beam element in the shell-element-based finite element model, and the equivalent structural stress at the spot-welded joint was obtained based on the equiva-lent structural stress method. Finally, the S-N curves of the spot-welded joints were fitted using the least-squares method. A comparison of the S-N curves of the spot-welded joints with those of different materials revealed that the material type had a significant influence on the S-N curve. To avoid this influence, a method for predicting the S-N curve of the spot-welded joints was proposed based on the relationship between the ratio of the ten-sile strength and that of the fatigue limit of each material. This research provides guidance for predicting the fatigue life of spot-welded joints in engineering applications.",

The basic aim of the research is to optimize the functioning of CLSC networks. For the above-said, two objective functions are made. The first objective is to minimize the cost of production and assembly expenses of the forward and reverse logistics. Secondly, an endeavour has been made to reduce the fixed costs associated with plants and retailers. For the sake of achieving two objective functions, two methods are employed: triangular fuzzy numbers and triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Among the two methods, triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers achieved the said objectives with greater optimization substantiated by statistics.

    "abstract": "Logistics is an important guarantee for economic and social development. Among the various aspects of logistics, the urban logistics end distribution link, which involves the direct connection between distribution personnel and customers, has a direct impact on customers' sense of experience and satisfaction with logistics services. At present, there are unscientific and unreasonable selection methods for logistics end distribution paths, often based on the subjective experience of distribution personnel, which often results in a mismatch between distribution paths and distribution needs, affecting market demand while further increasing the distribution costs of enterprises. Therefore, based on the characteristics of customer-consumers, this paper considers that consumers can select multiple receiving addresses, and each address has a corresponding time window limit. This paper finds that it needs to spend a lot of costs for the enterprise to improve the service level of distribution, and the enterprise can save the cost from time window, as well as obtain the better distribution time by using alternative addresses through the verification and analysis of an example. Based on the above analysis, this paper proposes the urban logistics terminal distribution path optimization path based on large-scale neighbourhood search algorithm, which can promote the further matching between logistics distribution enterprises and customer needs, so as to improve the probability of consumers receiving goods in time as well as reduce the cost of enterprises.",

The testing of the mechanical properties of silicon brass CuZn24Si was carried out by a standard uniaxial tensile test, thus a flow curve was determined to describe the material behaviour. The initial temperatures of the environment, blank and tools were measured with an infrared thermal imager. A comprehensive finite element stress analysis of the deformable tools was carried out for the assembly phase of the dies, and for workpiece and tools in the deep drawing and ironing processes. The comparison of measured and numerically estimated temperatures had a good agreement, so the developed numerical model was confirmed and validated.

The forming of TRIP steels in the deep drawing process enables the production of a thin-walled final product with superior mechanical properties. For this reason, this study presents comprehensive research into the deep drawing of cylindrical cups made from TRIP steel. The research focuses on three main aspects of the deep drawing process, namely the sheet metal thinning, the maximum force value and the ear height as a result of the anisotropic material behaviour. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were built to predict all the mentioned output parameters of the part or the process itself. The ANNs were trained using data obtained from a sufficient number of simulations based on the finite element method (FEM). The ANN models were developed based on variable material properties, including anisotropic parameters, blank holding force, blank diameter, and friction coefficient. A good agreement between simulation, ANN and experimental results is evident.",

    "abstract": "It is indisputable that some type of coordinate measurement system (CMS) is generally used to assess the quality of dimensional and geometric characteristics. Considering the required accuracy, flexibility, and speed of measurement, a CMM with a scanning sensor may offer the best performance. These measurement systems are very complex, and many factors affect the reliability of the measurement results. A Metrologist’s choice represents the greatest variability in the measurement strategy. Previous research has shown that the measurement results can be changed up to 100 % by choosing a different measurement strategy when evaluating the form error. This paper conducts a detailed study of the impact of the measurement strategy on the cylindricity error when measuring eleven workpieces with the same nominal characteristics, but different real characteristics described by roughness and the reference value of cylindricity. To examine the influence and importance of certain factors and their levels, design of experiment (DoE) and unsupervised machine learning techniques of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), were used. The results suggest that depending on the real geometry of the workpiece, different factors with different percentages influence the output characteristic. The objective was to choose a uniform measurement strategy when measuring cylindricity on the CMM, while the prior information about the actual geometry of the workpiece is lacking.",

    "abstract": "The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) has received considerable scholarly attention as a classic problem. However, in practical industrial manufacturing scenarios, it is common for an operation to have multiple preceding parallel operations. This not only necessitates adhering to the sequential relationships inherent in FJSP but also requires ensuring that preceding operations are completed simultaneously whenever feasible. We term this scenario as the Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem with Parallel Operations (FJSP-PO), a pervasive challenge encountered across nearly every production line in real-world discrete manufacturing applications. Despite its prevalence, there is a noticeable scarcity of research on FJSP-PO in existing literature. Given the objective of synchronizing multiple preceding operations, FJSP-PO presents a broader solution space and more intricate optimization challenges compared to traditional FJSP. To address this, we propose an Attention Restart method based on Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (AR-HGAT). Leveraging a heterogeneous graph network structure and reinforcement learning, AR-HGAT learns the implicit features of operations and machines through node-level and semantic-level attention mechanisms. The AR mechanism is utilized to determine the optimal scheduling of operations at specific time slots. Compared to existing FJSP methods, our AR-HGAT approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of inference time and solution effectiveness. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis using authentic operational data from companies and contrasted it with results obtained from an online tree search algorithm, thereby providing empirical validation of the effectiveness of the proposed AR-HGAT method.",

    "abstract": "As the third largest greenhouse gas emission industry across the globe, the transportation industry dominates a major position in the total carbon emission. Multimodal transportation has incomparable advantages over single-modal transportation, and choosing transportation routes and modes under the background of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality is crucial. The uncertainties of demand and transportation time were described using the maximum regret value and Lyapunov central limit theorem, respectively, and a robust optimization model for cold chain multimodal transportation routes considering hybrid uncertainty of carbon emissions was established. Then, a dual-pheromone ant colony algorithm was designed, and the improved niche genetic algorithm was nested into the ant colony algorithm to solve the model. Results showed that the changes in transportation time and node transfer time lead to the changes in transportation cost and transportation scheme, and the robust optimization of the multimodal transportation route under hybrid uncertainties is affected by the regret value constraint and the fluctuation range of uncertain factors, resulting in the increase in transportation cost and carbon emission cost. Therefore, the decision-makers of cold chain multimodal transportation must predict the influence of uncertain factors, choose the appropriate maximum regret value, and pay attention to the mixed time window constraints of transportation time and node transfer time to reduce costs and improve efficiency.",

To address these issues, a dynamic scheduling method is proposed. Initially, a discrete manufacturing workshop scheduling problem model is developed, considering the unique characteristics of the workshop. Digital Twin technology and a Competitive Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm are then integrated to create the scheduling model. Finally, Siamese Neural Networks are incorporated to form a dynamic scheduling mechanism that optimizes disturbance scheduling. The research model demonstrated a quick convergence, efficiently searching for the optimal fitness value using both the Sphere and Griewank functions. In the scheduling objective function test, the model achieved a maximum completion time of 244.8 minutes, the shortest time compared to similar technologies. In Siamese Neural Network experiments, the model successfully suppressed the influence of disturbances, maintaining optimal scheduling performance. Without adjustments for disturbances, the maximum completion time was 58.5 minutes. After optimization, it decreased to 54.2 minutes. These results demonstrate the effective application of the proposed technology in workshop scheduling. The findings provide valuable technical insights for the application of intelligent technologies in workshop scheduling optimization.",

The production planning focus on the regulation of production rates and the sizing of finished product’s safety stock to meet costumer’s demand. The safety stock is built to palliate shortages when the manufacturing operation begins generating non-conforming products and is shutdown to perform restoration action. In the other hand, preventive maintenance activities are also planned to minimise the quantity of non-conforming products. Mathematical models are proposed and consider all sub-policies and scenarios contingent on the production control policy as well as the entire range of possible values for the safety stock level. A numerical procedure has been established to ascertain the optimal integrated policy, aiming to minimize the total accrued cost per time unit along an infinite horizon. A simulation model has also been created to check and validate the analytical results. Finally, a comparative analysis is presented to prove that the proposed joint policy outperforms other strategies considered in the literature and practice and can result in substantial economic gains.",

    "abstract": "Combining timber and glass in the wall elements of the building envelope with the proper orientation of such transparent façade elements enables the utilization of solar energy for heating and internal illumination of the building. However, the asymmetrical layout of timber-glass wall elements in such buildings can result in problems with the horizontal stability of the structure, so their participation to load-bearing capacity of the structure is usually neglected. The study deals with solutions for such elements as horizontal load-bearing members with proper connection details. First, specifically developed timber-glass wall elements were experimentally tested under monotonic and cyclic horizontal point load, and further in combination with classical timber-framed wall elements implemented into special single and two-storey box-house models, which were further experimentally tested on the shaking table. In the second part as the main goal of the study, a quite simple mathematical model of the box-house prototypes is developed using a fictive diagonal element for simulating the racking stiffness of the bracing timber-glass wall element. The calculated results for the 1st vibration period are compared with the previously measured experimental results to prove an accuracy of the developed model. Finally, a linear time-history calculation is done as a sample presentation of the developed mathematical model using Landers acceleration spectrum. The developed mathematical model enables a simple and effective seismic response calculation of timber buildings considering the developed timber-glass wall elements as load-bearing bracing elements against horizontal load actions. The model can also be recommended for using in further parametric numerical academic studies analysing the influence of various parameters.",

In addition to the price and time efficiencies that characterize agile and lean supply chains, strategies for low-carbon and energy-efficient external transport must also be incorporated. This research therefore focuses on the challenges of organizing the supply of small overseas shipments to define how the relationship between land and sea transport in the selected intermodal chain affects environmental and energy performance. Understanding the input parameters and their impacts is a prerequisite for planning CO2, NOx, SO2 and NMHC emissions, as well as energy efficiency (EE) of overseas transportation. The number of individual transport legs and their characteristics are crucial parameters for sustainable transport chains. The applicability of the proposed research framework is carried out on the example of outbound supply chains of the southern part of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor using intermodal transport chains of small shipments via the ports of Koper and Genoa. The results of the case study show that an additional transport leg representing only 2 % longer land transport to the port of Genoa significantly affects the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain's compared to chains via the port of Koper. Moreover, other results also require special attention in supply chain modeling. The study enriches the field of supply chain engineering, as there is a lack of such studies. The study is part of the project \"Green port - Developing a sustainable model for the growth of the green port\", co-founded by the Slovenian Research Agency.",

In the paper optimization of steelmaking of 70MnVS4 steel is presented. 70MnVS4 is a high-strength microalloyed steel which is used for forging of connecting rods in the automotive industry. During 70MnVS4 ladle treatment, the sulfur addition in the melt should be conducted only once. For several reasons the sulfur is repeatedly added and therefore threatening clogging during continuous casting and as such influencing surface defects occurrence and steel cleanliness. Accordingly, the additional sulfur addition was predicted using linear regression and genetic programming. Following parameters were collected within the period from January 2018 to December 2018 (78 consequently cast batches): sulfur and carbon cored wire addition after chemical analysis after tapping, carbon, manganese and sulfur content after tapping, time between chemical analysis after tapping and starting of the casting, ferromanganese and ferrosilicon addition and additional sulfur cored wire addition. Based on modelling results it was found out that the ferromanganese is the most influential parameter. Accordingly, 12 consequently cast batches (from February 2019 to October 2019) were produced with as lower as possible addition of ferromanganese. The additional sulfur addition in all 12 cases was not needed. Also, the melt processing time, surface quality of rolled material and sulfur cored wire consumption did not change statistically significantly after reduction of ferromanganese addition. The steel cleanliness was statistically significantly better.",

It is often the case that process manufactured products are not designed concurrently, so by the end of the product design phase the Process Manufacturing Concept (PMC) has yet to be decided. Allocating process capable tolerances to the product during the design phase is therefore not possible. The robustness of the concept (how capable it is to achieve the product specification), only becomes clear at this late stage and thus after testing and iteration. In this article, a method for calculating the unit-to-unit robustness of an early-stage for a PMC is proposed. The method uses variability and adjustability information from the manufacturing concept in combination with sensitivity information from products' design to predict its functional performance variation. A Technology maturation factor for addressing varied process capability confidence was applied. A four-step process of Define, Connect, Map and Quantify was proposed for calculating PMC robustness and was tested for a wound-care product. The results show that the method was applicable and enabled PMC selection based on quantified robustness. The case also demonstrates that higher robustness is possible even at higher parameter variability with suitable measurements and adjustability.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the numerical simulation of quenching cylindrical steel sample immersed in three different quenchants: water, 5 % aquatensid solution, and isorapid oil. The quenching process starts from the initial temperature of the cylinder at 850 °C and moves through the air until it reaches the quenching bath. The quenchant is held at constant temperature of 40 °C. The cylinder is made of carefully selected steel which does not change its structure during quenching and heating. Cylindrical samples were manufactured in three different dimensions (R, H), (mm): (12.5 × 100), (25 × 150) and (37.5 × 225), so that four measuring points were installed in each sample. Each measuring point consists of thermocouple installed beneath the cylinder surface, capable of measuring the temperature every half second. Based on the experiment, the numerical simulation is recognized as transient and nonlinear two-dimensional heat conduction problem consisting of the two main tasks: direct heat transfer problem (DHTP) and inverse heat transfer problem (IHTP). The paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization approach for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients during the numerical simulation of quenching cylindrical steel sample. The proposed approach gained better results and less convergence time compared to the results from the literature. The paper includes methods, algorithms and the source code for the calculation of the temperature fields in time and heat transfer coefficient estimation of the IHTP. The simulation software has been implemented in C# programming language and can be found at http://github.com/bhrnjica/quenching_simulation.",

    "abstract": "The vehicle routing problem with split deliveries and pickups is a hot research topic in recent years, where a customer can be served multiple times with split deliveries and pickups. The objective is to minimize the travel distance, use the fewest number of vehicles and increase the load rate, which will further reduce the carbon emissions that damage the environment. In this paper, we use a two-stage construction heuristic approach to solve this problem. First, partitioning algorithms based on the multi-restart-iterative sweep algorithm are adopted to partition the customer domain into sub-domains according to the vehicle capacity, and to determine the split points and the corresponding values. Second, a modified Clarke-Wright savings algorithm is used to check the possibility of each point in each route based on the load of each point and the vehicle load limitation. The three case studies with 12 instances per each from the reconstructed Solomon benchmark datasets were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approaches-Unsplit, Both-Split and Enhanced-Both-Split. The comparison among these approaches reveals that the splits reduce the total travel cost and vehicles used, and increase the average loading rate considerably, especially when customers have larger demand values. Our computation results proves that the vehicle routing problem with split deliveries and pickups is highly beneficial for transportation and logistics enterprises.",

    "abstract": "The use of a double-skin façade (DSF) is a quite new approach in the building renovation process, complementing conventional renovation strategies. A double-skin façade is an envelope wall construction that consists of two transparent surfaces separated by a cavity and can essentially improve the thermal and acoustic resistance of the building envelope. The main double-skin wall components are usually composed of a hardened external single glazing pane and a double or triple thermal insulating internal glass pane, which are connected to the frame structure. Recently, many studies have analysed the thermal and acoustic performance of DSF elements, but almost none in terms of structural behaviour, especially in terms of determining the racking resistance of such wall elements. Moreover, with a view to reduce the global warming potential, an eco-friendly timber frame instead of a commonly used steel, aluminium or plastic frame is studied in this analysis. However, structurally combining timber and glass to develop an appropriate load-bearing structural element is a very complex process involving a combination of two materials with different material properties, where the type of bonding can be selected as a crucial parameter affecting the racking resistance range. Since the costs of experiments performed on such full-scale DSF elements are very high and such experiments are time-consuming, it is crucial to develop special mathematical models for analysing the influence of the most important parameters. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to develop the finite element mathematical model of the studied DSF structural elements with a highly ecological solution by using a timber frame. In the second step, the developed model is further implemented in the numerical analysis of racking stiffness and followed by a comprehensive parametric numerical study on different parameters influencing the horizontal load-bearing capacity of such DSF timber elements. The obtained results indicate that the new approach of the developed load-bearing prefabricated timber DSF elements can essentially improve racking resistance and stiffness compared with the widely studied timber-glass single-skin wall elements and can thus be fully recommended especially in the structural renovation process of old buildings.",

    "abstract": "With the development of commodity market, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a topic of widespread concern for both enterprises and society. Cause-related marketing (CRM), as an effective marketing tool for enterprises to fulfill their social responsibility, is rapidly being applied to all stages of the supply chain. However, there is no conclusive evidence on the implementation strategy of CRM for supply chain members. In this paper, we study the decision and pricing strategies of CRM for the manufacturer and the retailer by constructing models for two scenarios: the manufacturer implements CRM, and the retailer implements CRM. We conclude that the donation percentage and the pro-sociality of consumers have a significant impact on the strategic and pricing decisions for supply chain members. The wholesale and selling prices will be higher when the manufacturer implements CRM. Our result also shows that the manufacturer and retailer are profitable in CRM only when the donation amount exceeds a certain percentage. In addition, to maximize profits, the manufacturer is more likely to allow a retailer to implement CRM, and the retailer is only optimally positioned to implement CRM when the pro-sociality of consumers is high or when the donation percentage is high.",

This paper presents a multi-objective location model considering the maximization of collaborative manufacturing capabilities and service benefits. This method first uses the two dimensions of customer share and market consumption to segment customers, and identify the weight of various customer groups. Secondly, the space vector model (VSM) is used to calculate the matching between manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing requirements. Then build a multi-objective location model based on the two goals of collaborative manufacturing capabilities and service benefits. Finally, the model was tested with simulation data, which proved the validity and feasibility of the model. According to the simulation results, managers can accurately select the optimal manufacturing base from multiple candidate manufacturing bases with regard to less costs, shorter lead times, better manufacturing capabilities, better service benefits. In this paper, Fuzzy theory, Logit model and VSM are combined to salve the problem of manufacturing base location. Considering resources and service benefits of each manufacturing base, it is helpful to optimize the location of enterprises. From the academic and practical points, this study provides a new perspective for the location problem.",

During bone drilling operations, the temperature may exceed the allowable limit of 47 °C, causing irrecoverable damages of thermal necrosis and seriously threatening the fracture treatment. One of the parameters affecting the temperature rise of the drilling site is the frequency of applying the drill bit and its extent of wear. The present study attempted to mitigate the effect of drill bit wear on the bone temperature rise through the internal gas cooling method via CO2 and to reduce the risk of incidence of thermal necrosis. To this end, drilling tests were conducted at three rotational speeds 1000, 2000, and 3000 r·min-1 in two states of without cooling and with internal gas cooling by CO2 through an internal coolant carbide drill bit, along with six drill bit states (new, used 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 times) on a bovine femur bone. The results indicated that in the internal gas cooling state, as the number of drill bit applications increased from the new state to more than 50 times, the temperature of the hole site increased on average by ΔT = 2-3 °C (n = 1000 r·min-1), ΔT = 5-8 °C (n = 2000 r·min-1), and ΔT = 5-7 °C (n = 3000 r·min-1). Furthermore, the internal gas cooling method was able to significantly reduce the effect of the drill bit wear on the temperature rise of the drilling site and to resolve the risk of incidence of thermal necrosis regardless of the process parameters for drilling operations.",

Moreover, a method of assessing the importance of indicators in the patterns description was proposed.

Based on the solution algorithm and the user portrait construction method, the solution scenario is established, and the distribution route and transportation distribution method are planned based on five real location data. Through the analysis of the solution scenarios, it can be obtained that after the optimization of the model, the transportation distribution cost of enterprises can be reduced, and the satisfaction of the transportation distribution service quality can be improved. The higher the complaint cost, the lower the total transportation and distribution cost, and the higher the satisfaction rate; the higher the time window penalty cost, the higher the total distribution cost, and the lower the satisfaction rate. Through several model comparisons, it is found that the optimized model has obvious advantages in transportation cost and good performance in transportation service satisfaction. To further strengthen the promotion and application of the distribution path optimization model, countermeasures are proposed in three aspects: establishing a unified end transportation information service platform, increasing the investment in end transportation path optimization, and strengthening the formulation of supporting policies to realize the optimization of end distribution services.",

    "abstract": "At present, great changes are taken place in the internal production management and resource allocation model of manufacturers. Under the premise of rational resource allocation, the completion period of products largely depends on the timeliness of resource allocation. The related studies mostly tackle the allocation of a single type of production resources in a single workshop, without considering much about the mutual influence between workshops. Through in-depth research on workshop manufacturing practices, this paper chooses to explore the planning, allocation, and demand prediction of manufacturing resources, which has long been a difficulty in workshop production. The research has great scientific research significance and practical value. The authors designed an algorithm based on the difference of the mean stagnation time of different production processes in the execution process, and used the algorithm to predict the number of production resources required in each period, before formulating the optimal configuration plan. This method is highly reasonable and applicable. After presenting a prediction method for the allocation demand of workshop manufacturing resources, the authors discussed whether the manufacturing resource allocation between different workshops is balanced in a fixed period. Then, a new idea was proposed for collaborative production between machines of different workshops in a specific environment, and an optimization algorithm was put forward to optimize the manufacturing resource allocation to machines facing the operation execution process. Through experiments, the authors compared the utilization rate of material, technological or human production resources in each period, and thereby verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "During the continuous casting of steel billets, several geometrical, inner and surface defects can occur due to the thermomechanical behavior during solidification. One of them is rhombic distortion (i.e. rhomboidity), which can lead to the occurrence of off-corner cracks and twisting of cast billets during further plastic deformation (i.e. rolling). Based on data of 2088 cast batches (64 different hypoeutectoid steel grades), 109,514 billets, produced from January 2022 to September 2022 in Štore Steel Ltd. (Slovenia), chemical composition (content of C, Si, Mn, S, Cr, Mo, Ni and V), casting parameters (average casting temperature, average difference between input and output cooling water, melt level, average cooling water flow and pressure in the first and second zone of secondary cooling) the linear regression and genetic programming were used in order to predict rhomboidity of continuously cast billets. The rhomboidity, in our case defined as relative diagonal difference, was determined using in-house developed computer vision system for measuring of rhomboidity. Based on the modelling results 9 batches (419 billets) of 42CrMos4 were cast in September 2022 with a 10 % higher water pressure in the first zone of secondary cooling (from 2.41 bar to 2.67 bar). The rhomboidity of continuously cast billets improved by 18.18 % (from 1.43 % to 1.21).",

Decision-making models are developed to examine the potential value of core sorting and quality grading in the remanufacturing system: a single-period model with deterministic demand, and a single-period model with stochastic demand (i.e., a newsvendor-type model). In each model, both the sorting strategy and the non-sorting strategy are discussed and compared. Our theoretical and numerical results show that: (1) In the deterministic demand case, core sorting is cost-effective only when the unit sorting cost is below a threshold value and the unit acquisition cost falls into a specific interval. Furthermore, in the case with two quality grades the adoption of sorting strategy with respect to the expected fraction of high-quality cores may be non-monotone: an initial increase in the expected fraction of high-quality cores may motivate a switch to core sorting, however, further increase in the expected fraction may motivate a reverse switch; (2) Similarly, in the stochastic demand case, the sorting strategy also becomes unattractive when the unit sorting cost is sufficiently high. In addition, the value of core sorting will be better off under more fluctuating demand for remanufactured products if the sorting strategy is the dominant strategy. Otherwise, it will be worse off.",

The joint transformation of logistics services to improve the profit of the LSI is not affected by the choice of mode, while the profit of LSP under the resale mode remains unchanged when she chooses joint intelligent transformation. When the intelligent transformation level is high, the LSI tends to choose the resale model; otherwise, the LSI tends to choose the platform model. When the LSP chooses intelligent transformation by herself, if the share ratio is low, the LSI tends to choose the resale model.

A well-chosen maintenance strategy can make a major contribution to increased efficiency of production processes. The main goal of this research is to propose a novel optimization approach to define optimal maintenance strategy that ensures the efficient operation of the production process while reducing maintenance costs. The developed optimization method is based on Howard’s policy iteration and describes the objective of the planning as a Markov decision process. The novelty and the scientific contribution of the presented study is the application of Howard’s policy iteration methodology in a Markov decision process for agile, condition-based maintenance strategy optimization. As the results of the numerical analysis of the scenarios shows, the implementation of an optimized maintenance strategy based on the proposed approach can significantly increase the maintenance efficiency of the production process. The main reason for this is that the level and type of maintenance is always implemented depending on the current state of the system components, which reduces both the maintenance cost and the losses due to production downtime.",

The telecommunication industry, in particular, faces these challenges as it experiences the effects of digital transformation and fast-changing markets. It requires a flexible and adaptive approach to project portfolio management (PPM) to optimize investments and deliver value. This article presents a successful case study of a PPM process using the Stage-Gate model in a prominent telecommunications company that operates in a dynamic and fast-growing environment. The Stage-Gate PPM model comprises four stages: Proposal Selection, Selection of Nominated Demands, Prioritization, and Categorization of Projects. The model is unique as it can be adapted to different projects and incorporates elements of Agile approaches, such as Portfolio Sprint meetings and artefacts. The study demonstrates the importance of a well-defined PPM process in coordinating short-term and long-term activities and effectively allocating time, money, and resources. The Stage-Gate PPM model can potentially enhance project success rates and bring greater value to companies by ensuring the realization of suitable projects. This article contributes significantly to the existing literature on portfolio management, providing valuable insights and lessons applicable to other companies in the industry to enhance their portfolio management processes. Furthermore, this study can interest scholars and researchers seeking to explore effective portfolio management in other complex and dynamic environments.",

In this article, we consider a setting where a manufacturer outsources two parallel subtasks to two different suppliers, and the manufacturer is time sensitive. On the premise that the project completion time follows the exponential distribution, some models are established to compare the proposed incentives and we get the comparative analysis of the proposed incentives. This paper puts forward three kinds of time-based incentive mechanisms, namely, deadline incentive mechanism, competition mechanism and mixed incentive mechanism.

    "abstract": "This paper provides an in-depth study of the assembly production variance problem through the largest supplier of General Motors China. We focus on the production variance problem in an unreliable assembly (MOBA) system with a finite inter-station buffer, focusing on two of the central issues, namely the output variance as well as the delivery schedule variance. We model every subsystem's departure procedure in the MOBA system using the Markov Arrival Process (MAP) approach. Through the approximate use of MAP, we successfully shorten the time needed to calculate the output variance as well as delivery schedule variance of a large-scale MOBA system, which improves the efficiency of the system while ensuring that it meets the customer's needs. The relationship between production variance and system parameters is also studied, which is of substantial significance for optimizing the productivity of MOBA systems and improving customer satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Today, energy conservation and reduction of consumption are crucial concerns for manufacturing companies. Current research on integrated scheduling of processing and assembly typically focuses only on equipment resources and processing and assembly processes. A new method for energy-saving integrated scheduling in workshops has been proposed, which incorporates the recently introduced time-of-use tiered electricity prices into the scheduling optimization model. This method also introduces an operation strategy of turning equipment on and off during idle periods. A multi-objective mathematical model was developed to minimize energy consumption and assembly delay time in the processing and assembly processes. Due to the complexity of the model, the standard firefly algorithm was improved when used to solve the model. This involved designing a three-layer encoding method and two decoding methods, and providing detailed steps of the algorithm. Using a mixed flow production line as an example, the final scheduling solutions were obtained through model construction and algorithm solving, taking into account the tiered electricity price. The results of the example demonstrate that parallel processing and assembly effectively reduce assembly delay costs, and the implementation of the on/off strategy reduces power consumption during the machining process.",

    "abstract": "With the implementation of cross-line operation in high-speed railway system, accessibility of cross-line passengers on the railway network has substantially improved. However, due to limitations of capacity, it is hard to schedule a conflict-free timetable based on a train line plan with many cross-line trains. In order to generate a feasible and optimal transportation plan, a novel methodology is introduced. The approach can simultaneously optimize both the line plans of cross-line trains and train timetable, aiming at having a trade-off between operating profit and direct service. Based on an event-activity network framework, a mixed integer programming model is established. Considering service quality would decline after optimizing line plan and train schedules, the objective of the model is set to minimize deviations from ideal schedules for main-line trains while maximize direct service frequency for cross-line passengers. To solve large-scale scenarios efficiently, an enhanced heuristic genetic algorithm is developed. Two smaller-scale cases are devised to validate the efficiency of the model and approach. Finally, the model and the algorithm are applied to a real-world scenario involving the Beijing-Shanghai High-speed Railway and its connecting lines. Also, comparative experiments, including a scenario without cross-line optimization, are conducted to evaluate the advantage of the proposed approach. The result shows the approach can help to quickly find a feasible solution and have a good balance between operating profit and passenger demand.",

Approximately 30 % confirmed that they are still active in leather manufacturing, indicating that the Polish tanning industry is experiencing a process of deindustrialization. Surveys conducted in 20 companies revealed that Polish tanneries operate on national, European, and global scales. Most of them are micro or small enterprises with annual revenues of up to PLN 5 million. The primary factor defining their competitiveness is the high quality of the products and services they offer. They mainly process calfskin and cowhides sourced from Poland and abroad, primarily for the footwear sector. Polish tanneries are aware of global trends, including the industry's shift towards ecological practices, the adoption of modern technologies, and the introduction of innovations.

As the reverse logistics network for recycling end-of-life vehicles suffers from high operating costs and low recycling rates, there is an urgent need to upgrade the actual recycling measures for end-of-life vehicles to an operable level. This article first uses the OGM (1, N) model to predict the number of end-of-life vehicles in the coming years. At the same time, a reverse logistics network model with the second-hand car market as the recycling centre was constructed with the goal of minimizing the total cost of the end-of-life vehicles reverse logistics network. The network model was simulated using mixed integer programming (MILP), and the optimal solution was solved through LINGO 12 programming. Through an example analysis of Shanghai, it is found that the market of end-of-life vehicles will embrace growth, and it is verified that the optimized reverse logistics network can effectively reduce the operation cost and logistics cost of recycling centres, and can effectively improve the actual recycling rate of end-of-life vehicles. Finally, the optimized site selection results are obtained, and a specific traffic distribution scheme is proposed, which is crucial for promoting cars that meet scrap standards to be recycled through formal channels and reducing logistics costs for recycling enterprises.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing plant layouts are developed to facilitate optimal process flow. Modern manufacturing systems must meet present production demands and be adaptable to changes in process flow in the future. Dynamic Cellular Manufacturing Systems (DCMS) increase the flexibility of layouts by reconfiguring cell structure and equipment distribution, to effectively adjust part routings for optimal process flow. Frequent reconfiguring of plant layout may not always be feasible or economical, however, when new product releases are planned, reconfiguring the plant layout to optimise the work-flow may be extremely beneficial. This paper presents a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) approach to solving a DCMS problem in a sustainable, and responsible manner. A bi-objective integer programming model was developed over multiple planning horizons with fluctuating product demands. This model aims to achieve sustainability by reducing the cost of production, mitigating the environmental impact of production, and minimise negative social impacts on labourers that work in such environments. A penalty function approach was used to enforce the model constraints during optimisation. This study details trade-offs between the economic factors of a DCMS, the environmental implications of reconfiguring such a system, and the social impacts of reconfigurations on the workforce.",

Concurrently, an optimization problem was derived from the evaluation issue, with the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) used to identify a reasonable default point and distance. To simplify the identification of these points, we enhanced the traditional WOA, resulting in an improved version, the IWOA, which demonstrated very good optimization performance. The IWOA's optimization capabilities were applied to determine the optimal ratio of short- and long-term debt coefficients, identifying the default point in the Kealhofer, McQuown, and Vasicek (KMV) credit monitoring model, replacing fixed values and yielding more precise results. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel analytical approach to credit risk measurement, advancing the development of related theories and methods. Accurate analysis of financial stability and risk is crucial in industrial sectors, including engineering and manufacturing. The simulation using specific data revealed that the IWOA-KMV model exhibited better and faster optimization capabilities, with greater discrimination ability compared to the KMV model. Overall, this study examines the risk factors in the cloud warehouse financing model, offers an improved version of the WOA, introduces a modified IWOA-KMV model to create a scientific, practical credit risk assessment framework, and provides guidance for risk control in cloud warehouse financing, a novel financing service.",

Hot-rolled bars are controlled as they cool to room temperature in specially designed cooling chambers, minimizing residual stresses and the development of preexisting surface and internal defects. The bar ends can be additionally covered with insulating material. The cooled, rolled bars undergo examination using automated control lines to detect surface and internal defects, which primarily originate from the casting process. Internal defects are identified using ultrasonic testing. Between January 2022 and June 2023, 1550.0 tons of 61SiCr7 rolled bars, with diameters ranging from 53 mm to 72 mm and lengths from 7010 mm to 7955 mm, were examined using ultrasonic testing. The scrap was 109.6 tons (7.07 %). After collecting data on chemical composition (C, Si, Mn, Cr, Mo, Ni content), the casting process (casting temperature, cooling water pressure and flow in the first, second, and third zones of secondary cooling, as well as the temperature difference between input and output mould cooling water), and rolled bar geometry (diameter, length), scrap modelling after ultrasonic testing was carried using genetic programming. The genetic programming model suggested reducing the length of the rolled bar. Due to length multiplication, it was possible to reduce the rolled bar length from the initial lengths of 7010-7955 mm to the current lengths of 4558-6720 mm in June 2023. Based on this adjustment, a new production of rolled bars was established. By August 2024, 1251.9 tons of 61SiCr7 rolled bars were produced with the mentioned length adjustments. These rolled bars were subsequently examined using ultrasonic testing. The scrap was reduced by nearly 14 times, amounting to only 8.1 tons (0.64 %).",

However, designing HEVs that simultaneously meet high product quality, minimize environmental impact, and adhere to social responsibility standards remains a complex challenge. This study presents a decision-making model aimed at integrating these key sustainability criteria into the design and improvement of HEVs. The model combines three indices: the Aggregated Quality Index (AQI), Environmental Impact Index (EII) based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Social Responsibility Index (SRI), to assess and compare different HEV prototypes. By processing customer expectations, environmental impacts, and social responsibility considerations, the model predicts the optimal prototype that balances quality, environmental sustainability, and social standards. The findings demonstrate that applying this model can significantly enhance decision-making in sustainable vehicle development and support the creation of HEVs that better align with global sustainability goals.

The growing demand for electrical energy, as well as the need to adapt to hybrid operations that combine multi-project operation models with continuous production models, requires efficient workflow management. Accordingly, this article proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach for solving the scheduling problem in a Flexible Hybrid Flow Shop (FHFS) environment considering a transfer batch approach to minimize makespan and total tardiness. The approach is inspired by a real-world application in the electrical industry and also accounts for unrelated parallel machines, precedence, release times, and due dates for jobs at each production center as key constraints. Three real-data scenarios were generated and evaluated. In the first scenario, a 7 % improvement in makespan was observed compared to real execution times. In Scenario 2, the makespan improved significantly by 33 %, and only 17.4 % of jobs were delayed, compared to 96 % in the real data. Likewise, GA showed a lightly better performance over Tabu Search (TS) in 3.01 % for makespan while the delayed jobs found by GA were 25 % below those obtained by TS. These results highlight the potential of the proposed method to improve overall production efficiency, not only in the electrical sector but also in similar industries.",

Speed sampling was conducted to identify the optimal speed combination, establishing a set of candidate trajectories. A trajectory evaluation function was constructed, and the trajectory with the highest score was selected. The improved A* algorithm was integrated into the evaluation function, incorporating the obstacle rate to refine path planning. To eliminate redundant sections, a key point extraction algorithm was employed to adjust and smooth the path, ensuring optimal obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach demonstrated superior performance, achieving a shorter planned path, a rapid obstacle avoidance reaction time of 32 milliseconds, a 100 % success rate in obstacle avoidance, and a path smoothness of 97 %.

This study aims to explore the application of ultrasonic NDT data in manufacturing quality control by integrating machine learning technologies, with a specific focus on the Wavelet Neural Network optimized by Genetic Algorithms (GA-WNN). This study achieved significant prediction and evaluation results by applying a GA-WNN to quality control in manufacturing. Compared to traditional Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) models, the GA-WNN more effectively identifies and predicts potential quality issues, especially in noisy data and complex production environments, demonstrating higher accuracy and stability. When predicting possible defect types in the manufacturing process, the GA-WNN showed a notable improvement in accuracy over other models. Additionally, in quality stability evaluation, GA-WNN was able to capture production fluctuations more accurately, providing more valuable results for decision-making. The methodologies and discoveries of this study offer new perspectives and tools for quality control in manufacturing and the analysis of ultrasonic NDT data, presenting broad application prospects.",

    "abstract": "The CNC dry turning of Inconel 625 alloy was investigated in this study. Turning was performed using different feeds, corner radii, and insert types. The dimensions and the arithmetic mean surface roughness were measured before and after turning. The influence of the input parameters and the process modelling were evaluated using a full factorial design of experiments. Prediction models were developed, and process optimization was carried out to simultaneously maximize dimensional accuracy and surface quality. The optimal values of the input parameters were identified for the wiper insert, a feed rate of 0.1 mm/rev, and a corner radius of 0.8 mm. Under these conditions, the optimal deviation from the specified dimension was 0.2 mm, while the surface roughness was 0.297 µm. During the confirmation phase, the mean percentage errors were 0.9 % for surface roughness and 3.45 % for dimensional deviation. The percentage errors observed in the confirmation experiments, all of which were below 5 %, demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed approach for modelling and optimizing the turning of Inconel 625 alloy.",

The primary scientific research focus of our National Dimensional Metrology Laboratory is the development of metrological applications for industry, with ongoing improvements in calibration procedures for measuring machines and tools. Through a review of possible error sources, an innovative approach to reducing the most significant factors is proposed. This is specifically applied to the following calibration cases: field calibration of coordinate measuring machines, and laboratory calibration of precision probes and line scales. Instrumental and environmental errors can be effectively mitigated by using periodically calibrated laser interferometers in well-controlled air conditions, ensuring an uncertainty of 0.2 µm/m. Most geometrical errors can be minimized by precise adjustments to the interferometry and positioning systems, achieving an uncertainty of 0.3 µm/m. However, errors caused by temperature differences in the material along the measuring path remain the most influential. These arise due to the high expansion coefficient of the material and some uncertainty in its properties. After several hours of temperature stabilization, using three temperature sensors along the displacement range for software compensation, temperature differences still contribute significantly to measurement uncertainty. For example, the error is 0.5 µm/min in the case of line scale calibration and 1.1 µm/m for coordinate measuring machine calibration.",

In a multi-product manufacturing system, several types of products are manufactured by utilizing the same resources.

Simulation models of the alternative production systems are implemented using an open-source software. A comparative evaluation of CONWIP, Base Stock and CONWIP/Kanban Hybrid in multi-product manufacturing is carried out in a series of simulation experiments with varying demand arrival rates, setup times and control parameters. The control strategies are compared based on average wait time of backordered demand, average finished products inventories, and average length of backorders queues. The Base Stock strategy excels when the manufacturing system is subjected to high demand arrival rates. The CONWIP strategy produced consistently the highest level of finished goods inventories.

Most of these techniques consider the development of operative and predictive models. The difficulty in developing project planning models relies on estimating large sets of parameters and the need to include model sections of poorly identifiable, that increase costs and time. This work develops a hybrid forecasting model for all the phases that make up die-casting projects through a series of parameters and sub-models that contemplate the particularities of each case, thereby achieving greater precision in the forecast. The model identifies the cost and time factors that affect project planning, specifically in the die-casting industry, and intends to predict their future behaviour when certain initially given conditions are modified. To estimate the parameters of the hybrid model, several factors in the processes were considered that interact in this industry, such as primary matter costs and activities associated to the process. The considered processes that have a substantial economic impact on the implementation of the project were selected. The criteria for this selection considered identifying the relevant parts of the design and manufacturing in the die-casting industry. Process factors such as the Cost of aluminium and its related activities, whose processes will be grouped into cost and time entities to build a set of metrics that allow better control over them. Finally, the proposed model is based on analytical, parametric, and analog methods that achieve accuracy greater than 85 % in predicting the time and Cost of the process.",

Belonging to this class, carbon-fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (C/SiC) are used for critical applications due to their superior properties. However, these materials have also stringent properties of heterogeneity, anisotropy, and varying thermal properties that affect machining quality and process efficiency. So, developing a cutting force prediction model and analyzing machining parameters is an essential need for the accurate machining of such materials. In this study, a mechanistic-based feed direction cutting force prediction model for rotary ultrasonic profile milling of C/SiC composites is developed and validated experimentally. The experimental and simulation results closely match each other. The mean error and standard deviation were recorded as 1.358 % and 6.003, respectively. The parametric sensitivity analysis showed that cutting force decreased with increased cutting speed, whereas it increased with increased feed rate and cutting depth. The proposed cutting force model for rotary ultrasonic profile milling of C/SiC composites is robust and can be applied to predict cutting forces and optimize the machining process parameters at the industry level.",

    "abstract": "Research on the rock-breaking performance of the Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) cutter has primarily focused on sharp cutters, often overlooking the influence of chamfer. Notably, the design of chamfer parameters has been largely unreported. In this study, we established a theoretical model of cutting force that takes chamfer into account. We analysed the primary and secondary relationships of four factors – back rake angle, depth of cut, chamfer angle, and chamfer length – on the force of the PDC cutter. This was done through a pseudo-level orthogonal level test. A numerical simulation, based on the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method, was conducted to analyse the rock-breaking force and stress distribution characteristics of PDC cutters with different chamfer angles. Combined with a drop hammer impact test, we provided an optimized design of chamfer parameters. Our findings revealed that while the chamfer had a relatively minor influence on the force of the PDC cutter, it contributed to the optimal distribution of stress on the PDC cutter. This effectively protected the cutting edge and prevented early cracks and spalls of the cutter. When the chamfer angle was less than or equal to the back rake angle, the resultant force of the PDC cutter increased with the increase of the chamfer angle. However, when the chamfer angle was greater than the back rake angle, the resultant force of the PDC cutter first increased and then slightly decreased with the increase of the chamfer angle. Additionally, the resultant force of the PDC cutter increased approximately linearly with the increase of chamfer length. When the chamfer angle of the PDC cutter was between 30° and 45°, the fluctuation of the cutting force was relatively smooth, the rock-breaking process was stable, and the cutter’s impact resistance energy was relatively higher. These findings will provide valuable guidelines for the design of chamfered PDC cutters.",

Several defects, mostly related to thermomechanical behaviour in the mould, originate from the continuous casting process. The same casting speed of 1.6 m/min was used for all steel grades. In May 2023, a project was launched to adjust the casting speed according to the casting temperature. This adjustment included the steel grades with the highest number of surface defects and different carbon content: 16MnCrS5, C22, 30MnVS5, and 46MnVS5. For every 10 °C deviation from the prescribed casting temperature, the speed was changed by 0.02 m/min. During the 2-month period, the ratio of rolled bars with detected surface defects (inspected by an automatic control line) decreased for the mentioned steel grades. The decreases were from 11.27 % to 7.93 %, from 12.73 % to 4.11 %, from 16.28 % to 13.40 %, and from 25.52 % to 16.99 % for 16MnCrS5, C22, 30MnVS5, and 46MnVS5, respectively. Based on the collected chemical composition and casting parameters from these two months, models were obtained using linear regression and genetic programming. These models predict the ratio of rolled bars with detected surface defects and the length of detected surface defects. According to the modelling results, the ratio of rolled bars with detected surface defects and the length of detected surface defects could be minimally reduced by 14 % and 189 %, respectively, using casting speed adjustments. A similar result was achieved from July to November 2023 by adjusting the casting speed for the other 27 types of steel. The same was predicted with the already obtained models.

    "abstract": "Gauge blocks are an important basis for maintaining traceability in dimensional metrology, used for calibrating length measuring instruments and for adjustments in all branches of manufacturing. Their important feature is that they can be wrung with small dimensional uncertainty. An overview of the factors influencing the accuracy of a stack length, such as the quality of the gauge blocks (grade, wear), surface preparation (cleaning and usage of a lubricant), wringing (way and time, temperature of hands and gloves) is given in the paper. Experiments for determining these influences were performed with a highly precise gauge block comparator. Proper selection of gauge blocks, preparation of their surfaces and oiling improve the accuracy of a stack length. Application of a lubricant, wiped with a dry cloth or paper towel, helps to wring them more easily, but its contribution to the stack length in the experiment was 0.1 µm for oil and 0.2 µm for grease. Temperature changes of gauge blocks were estimated by holding them, and, during wringing in well controlled air conditions, monitoring them to yield the empirical coefficients of their warming up. The results showed that usage of gloves reduces the warming up by approximately half, but still the stack must be stabilised in well controlled conditions for at least one hour if it is used for micrometre-level precise measurements.",
