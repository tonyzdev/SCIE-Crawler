    "abstract": "Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural systems science generates knowledge that allows researchers to consider complex problems or take informed agricultural decisions. The rich history of this science exemplifies the diversity of systems and scales over which they operate and have been studied. Modeling, an essential tool in agricultural systems science, has been accomplished by scientists from a wide range of disciplines, who have contributed concepts and tools over more than six decades. As agricultural scientists now consider the \"next generation\" models, data, and knowledge products needed to meet the increasingly complex systems problems faced by society, it is important to take stock of this history and its lessons to ensure that we avoid re-invention and strive to consider all dimensions of associated challenges. To this end, we summarize here the history of agricultural systems modeling and identify lessons learned that can help guide the design and development of next generation of agricultural system tools and methods. A number of past events combined with overall technological progress in other fields have strongly contributed to the evolution of agricultural system modeling, including development of process-based bio-physical models of crops and livestock, statistical models based on historical observations, and economic optimization and simulation models at household and regional to global scales. Characteristics of agricultural systems models have varied widely depending on the systems involved, their scales, and the wide range of purposes that motivated their development and use by researchers in different disciplines. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across disciplines, and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage is set for the major advances in agricultural systems science that are needed for the next generation of models, databases, knowledge products and decision support systems. The lessons from history should be considered to help avoid roadblocks and pitfalls as the community develops this next generation of agricultural systems models.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural systems in Europe face accumulating economic, ecological and societal challenges, raising concerns about their resilience to shocks and stresses. These resilience issues need to be addressed with a focus on the regional context in which farming systems operate because farms, farmers' organizations, service suppliers and supply chain actors are embedded in local environments and functions of agriculture. We define resilience of a farming system as its ability to ensure the provision of the system functions in the face of increasingly complex and accumulating economic, social, environmental and institutional shocks and stresses, through capacities of robustness, adaptability and transformability. We (i) develop a framework to assess the resilience of farming systems, and (ii) present a methodology to operationalize the framework with a view to Europe's diverse farming systems. The framework is designed to assess resilience to specific challenges (specified resilience) as well as a farming system's capacity to deal with the unknown, uncertainty and surprise (general resilience). The framework provides a heuristic to analyze system properties, challenges (shocks, long-term stresses), indicators to measure the performance of system functions, resilience capacities and resilience-enhancing attributes. Capacities and attributes refer to adaptive cycle processes of agricultural practices, farm demographics, governance and risk management. The novelty of the framework pertains to the focal scale of analysis, i.e. the farming system level, the consideration of accumulating challenges and various agricultural processes, and the consideration that farming systems provide multiple functions that can change over time. Furthermore, the distinction between three resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability, transformability) ensures that the framework goes beyond narrow definitions that limit resilience to robustness. The methodology deploys a mixed-methods approach: quantitative methods, such as statistics, econometrics and modelling, are used to identify underlying patterns, causal explanations and likely contributing factors; while qualitative methods, such as interviews, participatory approaches and stakeholder workshops, access experiential and contextual knowledge and provide more nuanced insights. More specifically, analysis along the framework explores multiple nested levels of farming systems (e.g. farm, farm household, supply chain, farming system) over a time horizon of 1–2 generations, thereby enabling reflection on potential temporal and scalar trade-offs across resilience attributes. The richness of the framework is illustrated for the arable farming system in Veenkoloniën, the Netherlands. The analysis reveals a relatively low capacity of this farming system to transform and farmers feeling distressed about transformation, while other members of their households have experienced many examples of transformation.",

    "abstract": "Losses at every stage in the food system influence the extent to which nutritional requirements of a growing global population can be sustainably met. Inefficiencies and losses in agricultural production and consumer behaviour all play a role. This paper aims to understand better the magnitude of different losses and to provide insights into how these influence overall food system efficiency. We take a systems view from primary production of agricultural biomass through to human food requirements and consumption. Quantities and losses over ten stages are calculated and compared in terms of dry mass, wet mass, protein and energy. The comparison reveals significant differences between these measurements, and the potential for wet mass figures used in previous studies to be misleading. The results suggest that due to cumulative losses, the proportion of global agricultural dry biomass consumed as food is just 6% (9.0% for energy and 7.6% for protein), and 24.8% of harvest biomass (31.9% for energy and 27.8% for protein). The highest rates of loss are associated with livestock production, although the largest absolute losses of biomass occur prior to harvest. Losses of harvested crops were also found to be substantial, with 44.0% of crop dry matter (36.9% of energy and 50.1% of protein) lost prior to human consumption. If human over-consumption, defined as food consumption in excess of nutritional requirements, is included as an additional inefficiency, 48.4% of harvested crops were found to be lost (53.2% of energy and 42.3% of protein). Over-eating was found to be at least as large a contributor to food system losses as consumer food waste. The findings suggest that influencing consumer behaviour, e.g. to eat less animal products, or to reduce per capita consumption closer to nutrient requirements, offer substantial potential to improve food security for the rising global population in a sustainable manner.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins are very promising to bring smart farming to new levels of farming productivity and sustainability. A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent of a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Using Digital Twins as a central means for farm management enables the decoupling of physical flows from its planning and control. As a consequence, farmers can manage operations remotely based on (near) real-time digital information instead of having to rely on direct observation and manual tasks on-site. This allows them to act immediately in case of (expected) deviations and to simulate effects of interventions based on real-life data. This paper analyses how Digital Twins can advance smart farming. It defines the concept, develops a typology of different types of Digital Twins, and proposes a conceptual framework for designing and implementing Digital Twins. The framework comprises a control model based on a general systems approach and an implementation model for Digital Twin systems based on the Internet of Things—Architecture (IoT-A), a reference architecture for IoT systems. The framework is applied to and validated in five smart farming use cases of the European IoF2020 project, focussing on arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming and livestock farming.",

    "abstract": "Decision support tools, usually considered to be software-based, may be an important part of the quest for evidence-based decision-making in agriculture to improve productivity and environmental outputs. These tools can lead users through clear steps and suggest optimal decision paths or may act more as information sources to improve the evidence base for decisions. Yet, despite their availability in a wide range of formats, studies in several countries have shown uptake to be disappointingly low. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to investigate the factors affecting the uptake and use of decision support tools by farmers and advisers in the UK. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys, we found that fifteen factors are influential in convincing farmers and advisers to use decision support tools, which include usability, cost-effectiveness, performance, relevance to user, and compatibility with compliance demands. This study finds a plethora of agricultural decision support tools in operation in the UK, yet, like other studies, shows that their uptake is low. A better understanding of the fifteen factors identified should lead to more effective design and delivery of tools in the future.",

We discuss the state of models relative to five different Use Cases spanning field, farm, landscape, regional, and global spatial scales and engaging questions in past, current, and future time periods. Contributions from multiple disciplines have made major advances relevant to a wide range of agricultural system model applications at various spatial and temporal scales. Although current agricultural systems models have features that are needed for the Use Cases, we found that all of them have limitations and need to be improved. We identified common limitations across all Use Cases, namely 1) a scarcity of data for developing, evaluating, and applying agricultural system models and 2) inadequate knowledge systems that effectively communicate model results to society. We argue that these limitations are greater obstacles to progress than gaps in conceptual theory or available methods for using system models. New initiatives on open data show promise for addressing the data problem, but there also needs to be a cultural change among agricultural researchers to ensure that data for addressing the range of Use Cases are available for future model improvements and applications. We conclude that multiple platforms and multiple models are needed for model applications for different purposes. The Use Cases provide a useful framework for considering capabilities and limitations of existing models and data.",

    "abstract": "The WOFOST cropping systems model has been applied operationally over the last 25 years as part of the MARS crop yield forecasting system. In this paper we provide an updated description of the model and reflect on the lessons learned over the last 25 years. The latter includes issues like system performance, model sensitivity, spatial model setup, parameterization and calibration approaches as well as software implementation and version management. Particularly for spatial model calibrations we provide experience and guidelines on how to execute calibrations and how to evaluate WOFOST model simulation results, particularly under conditions of limited field data availability. As an open source model WOFOST has been a success with at least 10 different implementations of the same concept. An overview is provided for those implementations which are managed by MARS or Wageningen groups. However, the proliferation of WOFOST implementations has also led to questions on the reproducibility of results from different implementations as is demonstrated with an example from MARS. In order to certify that the different WOFOST implementations and versions available can reproduce basic sets of inputs and outputs we make available a large set of test cases as appendix to this publication. Finally, new methodological extensions have been added to WOFOST in simulating the impact of nutrients limitations, extreme events and climate variability. Also, a difference is made in the operational and scientific versions of WOFOST with different licensing models and possible revenue generation. Capitalizing both on academic development as well as model testing in real-world situations will help to enable new applications of the WOFOST model in precision agriculture and smart farming.",

    "abstract": "The improvement and application of pest and disease models to analyse and predict yield losses including those due to climate change is still a challenge for the scientific community. Applied modelling of crop diseases and pests has mostly targeted the development of support capabilities to schedule scouting or pesticide applications. There is a need for research to both broaden the scope and evaluate the capabilities of pest and disease models. Key research questions not only involve the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on known pathosystems, but also on new pathogens which could alter the (still incompletely documented) impacts of pests and diseases on agricultural systems. Yield loss data collected in various current environments may no longer represent a adequate reference to develop tactical, decision-oriented, models for plant diseases and pests and their impacts, because of the ongoing changes in climate patterns. Process-based agricultural simulation modelling, on the other hand, appears to represent a viable methodology to estimate the impacts of these potential effects. A new generation of tools based on state-of-the-art knowledge and technologies is needed to allow systems analysis including key processes and their dynamics over appropriate suitable range of environmental variables. This paper offers a brief overview of the current state of development in coupling pest and disease models to crop models, and discusses technical and scientific challenges. We propose a five-stage roadmap to improve the simulation of the impacts caused by plant diseases and pests; i) improve the quality and availability of data for model inputs; ii) improve the quality and availability of data for model evaluation; iii) improve the integration with crop models; iv) improve the processes for model evaluation; and v) develop a community of plant pest and disease modelers.",

In this paper we consider how the existing agricultural innovation systems (AIS) approach might be opened up to better support the creation of innovation niches. We engage with Innovation Ecosystems thinking to consider the ways in which it might enhance efforts to create multi-actor, cross-sectoral innovation niches that are capable of supporting transitions to sustainable agricultural systems across multiple scales. While sharing many similarities with AIS thinking, Innovation Ecosystems thinking has the potential to broaden AIS by: emphasizing the role of power in shaping directionality in innovation platforms or innovation communities that are connected to niches and their interaction with regimes; highlighting the plurality of actors and actants and the integral role of ecological actants in innovation; and offering an umbrella concept through which to cross scalar and paradigmatic or sector boundaries in order to engage with a variety of innovation systems affecting multifunctional agricultural landscapes and systems. To this end, an Agricultural Innovation Ecosystems approach may help design and support development of transboundary, inter-sectoral innovation niches that can realize more collective and integrated innovation in support of sustainability transitions, and help enact mission oriented agricultural innovation policy.",

There are number of factors that influence the extent to which farmers in a particular location adopt CSA technologies. This study applied a participatory assessment method to assess farmers' preferences and willingness-to-pay for selected CSA practices and technologies in diverse rainfall zones. The study found that farmers' preferences for CSA technologies are marked by some commonalities as well as differences according to their socio-economic characteristics and rainfall zones. The most preferred technologies by local farmers were crop insurance, weather-based crop agro-advisories, rainwater harvesting, site-specific integrated nutrient management, contingent crop planning and laser land levelling. The results also indicate that farmers' preferences and willingness-to-pay are influenced by technologies and their cost of implementation. This study shows the potential for using a participatory CSA prioritization approach to provide information on climate change adaptation planning at local level.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the scope and depth of research on the five major types of risks in agriculture, and the extent to which those studies have addressed the impacts of, and policies to mitigate individual types of risk as opposed to more holistic analyses of the multiple sources of risk with which farmers have to cope with. Risk is at the center of new paradigms and approaches that inform risk management initiatives and shape investments in many countries. Although the literature includes several substantive reviews of the methods available for risk analysis and their empirical applications have been extensively scrutinized, limited information exists about which types of risks have received sufficient attention, and which have not. This limited information is perplexing because farmers manage multiple risks at the same time and unanticipated events continue to have substantial impacts on farmers. We identify 3283 peer-reviewed studies that address one or more of the five major types of risk in agriculture (production risk, market risk, institutional risk, personal risk, and financial risk) published between 1974 and 2019. We conduct a literature search and then apply an eligibility criteria to retain eligible studies from the search. We then classify those eligible studies based on risk type and geographic focus. We placed no limit on the temporal scale, geographic focus, or study method for inclusion in our search. Results show that 66% of the 3283 studies focused solely on production risk, with only 15% considering more than one type of risk. Only 18 studies considered all five types of risk and those either asked how farmers perceived the importance of each risk or were focused on conceptual issues, rather than assessing how exposure to all the risks quantitatively affects farm indicators such as yields or incomes. Without more detailed analyses of the multiple types of risks faced by farmers, farmers and policymakers will lack the information needed to devise relevant risk management strategies and policies. A shift in research focus towards the analysis of multiple contemporaneous types of risk may provide a basis that gives farmers greater options for coping with and managing risk. We discuss some of the challenges for studying multiple risks simultaneously, including data requirements and the need for probability distributions and the role of simulation approaches.",

    "abstract": "There is much existing knowledge about the factors that influence adoption of new practices in agriculture but few attempts have been made to construct predictive quantitative models of adoption for use by those planning agricultural research, development, extension and policy. ADOPT (Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool) is the result of such an attempt, providing predictions of a practice's likely rate and peak level of adoption as well as estimating the importance of various factors influencing adoption. It employs a conceptual framework that incorporates a range of variables, including variables related to economics, risk, environmental outcomes, farmer networks, characteristics of the farm and the farmer, and the ease and convenience of the new practice. The ability to learn about the relative advantage of the practice, as influenced by characteristics of both the practice and the potential adopters, plays a central role. Users of ADOPT respond to 22 questions related to: a) characteristics of the practice that influence its relative advantage, b) characteristics of the population influencing their perceptions of the relative advantage of the practice, c) characteristics of the practice influencing the ease and speed of learning about it, and d) characteristics of the potential adopters that influence their ability to learn about the practice. ADOPT provides a prediction of the diffusion curve of the practice and sensitivity analyses of the factors influencing the speed and peak level of adoption. In this paper the model is described and its ability to predict the diffusion of agricultural practices is demonstrated using examples of new crop types, new cropping technology and grazing options. As well as providing predictions, ADOPT is designed to increase the conceptual understanding and consideration of the adoption process by those involved in agricultural research, development, extension and policy.",

    "abstract": "Climate variability is a major source of risk to smallholder farmers and pastoralists, particularly in dryland regions. A growing body of evidence links climate-related risk to the extent and the persistence of rural poverty in these environments. Stochastic shocks erode smallholder farmers' long-term livelihood potential through loss of productive assets. The resulting uncertainty impedes progress out of poverty by acting as a disincentive to investment in agriculture – by farmers, rural financial services, value chain institutions and governments. We assess evidence published in the last ten years that a set of production technologies and institutional options for managing risk can stabilize production and incomes, protect assets in the face of shocks, enhance uptake of improved technologies and practices, improve farmer welfare, and contribute to poverty reduction in risk-prone smallholder agricultural systems. Production technologies and practices such as stress-adapted crop germplasm, conservation agriculture, and diversified production systems stabilize agricultural production and incomes and, hence, reduce the adverse impacts of climate-related risk under some circumstances. Institutional interventions such as index-based insurance and social protection through adaptive safety nets play a complementary role in enabling farmers to manage risk, overcome risk-related barriers to adoption of improved technologies and practices, and protect their assets against the impacts of extreme climatic events. While some research documents improvements in household welfare indicators, there is limited evidence that the risk-reduction benefits of the interventions reviewed have enabled significant numbers of very poor farmers to escape poverty. We discuss the roles that climate-risk management interventions can play in efforts to reduce rural poverty, and the need for further research on identifying and targeting environments and farming populations where improved climate risk management could accelerate efforts to reduce rural poverty.",

    "abstract": "Global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems aim to provide up-to-date information regarding food production to different actors and decision makers in support of global and national food security. To help reduce price volatility of the kind experienced between 2007 and 2011, a global system of agricultural monitoring systems is needed to ensure the coordinated flow of information in a timely manner for early warning purposes. A number of systems now exist that fill this role. This paper provides an overview of the eight main global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems currently in operation and compares them based on the input data and models used, the outputs produced and other characteristics such as the role of the analyst, their interaction with other systems and the geographical scale at which they operate. Despite improvements in access to high resolution satellite imagery over the last decade and the use of numerous remote-sensing based products by the different systems, there are still fundamental gaps. Based on a questionnaire, discussions with the system experts and the literature, we present the main gaps in the data and in the methods. Finally, we propose some recommendations for addressing these gaps through ongoing improvements in remote sensing, harnessing new and innovative data streams and the continued sharing of more and more data.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural innovation systems has become a popular approach to understand and facilitate agricultural innovation. However, there is often no explicit reflection on the role of agricultural innovation systems in food systems transformation and how they relate to transformative concepts and visions (e.g. agroecology, digital agriculture, Agriculture 4.0, AgTech and FoodTech, vertical agriculture, protein transitions). To support such reflection we elaborate on the importance of a mission-oriented perspective on agricultural innovation systems. We review pertinent literature from innovation, transition and policy sciences, and argue that a mission-oriented agricultural innovation systems (MAIS) approach can help understand how agricultural innovation systems at different geographical scales develop to enable food systems transformation, in terms of forces, catalysts, and barriers in transformative food systems change. Focus points can be in the mapping of missions and sub-missions of MAIS within and across countries, or understanding the drivers, networks, governance, theories of change, evolution and impacts of MAIS. Future work is needed on further conceptual and empirical development of MAIS and its connections with existing food systems transformation frameworks. Also, we argue that agricultural systems scholars and practitioners need to reflect on how the technologies and concepts they work on relate to MAIS, how these represent a particular directionality in innovation, and whether these also may support exnovation.",

However, there are likely to be broader implications arising from the digitalisation of agricultural innovation systems. Agricultural knowledge and advice networks are important components of agricultural innovation systems that have the potential to be digitally disrupted. In this paper, we review trends within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and prepare for potential transformations in these networks. Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise. These findings have implications for the oversight of international agri-food sectors.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the literature on women's land rights (WLR) and poverty reduction. It uses the Gender, Agriculture and Assets Project (GAAP) conceptual framework to identify pathways by which WLR could reduce poverty and increase wellbeing of women and their households in rural areas. It uses a systematic review search methodology to identify papers for inclusion, but adopts a more synthetic approach to assess the level of agreement and the amount of evidence within this literature. The paper examines the evidence from qualitative as well as quantitative studies on each of these pathways. Owing to the scarcity of experimental studies, the review of empirical work is based mostly on observational studies. We find some evidence on these relationships, but many of the key pathways have not been empirically analyzed. The evidence is strong for relationships between WLR and bargaining power and decision-making on consumption, human capital investment, and intergenerational transfers. There is a high level of agreement, but weaker evidence on the relationship between WLR and natural resource management, government services and institutions, empowerment and domestic violence, resilience and HIV risk, and consumption and food security. There is less agreement and insufficient evidence on the associations between WLR and other livelihoods, and a higher level of agreement, but still limited evidence on associations between WLR and credit, technology adoption, and agricultural productivity. Notably, we find no papers that directly investigate the link between WLR and poverty. Many gaps in the evidence arise from a failure to account for the complexity of land rights regimes, the measurement of land rights at the household level, the lack of attention paid to gender roles, and the lack of studies from countries outside Africa. Many studies are limited by small sample sizes, the lack of credible counterfactuals, lack of attention to endogeneity and selection bias, and possible response bias on questions of domestic violence and empowerment. There are very few rigorous evaluations of reforms that strengthened WLR. The paper concludes that gaps in the evidence should not deter the careful design and implementation of programs and policies to strengthen WLR, given the ongoing land tenure reforms in many countries. Different modalities and mechanisms for strengthening WLR could be tested, with appropriate counterfactuals. Program designers and evaluators can strategically identify pathways and outcomes where evidence gaps exist, and deliberately design studies to close those gaps.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have applied machine learning to crop yield prediction with a focus on specific case studies. The data and methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems, such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is a promising method especially when large amounts of data are being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth and development) and applying machine learning without information leakage. We created features using crop simulation outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to support different crops and countries with small configuration changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies, we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts. The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30 days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL) (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS). In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse for DE and FR. The baseline can be improved by adding new data sources, designing more predictive features and evaluating different machine learning algorithms. The baseline will motivate the use of machine learning in large-scale crop yield forecasting.",

    "abstract": "In the European Union (EU-27) and UK, animal farming generated annually more than 1.4 billion tonnes of manure during the period 2016–2019. Of this, more than 90% is directly re-applied to soils as organic fertiliser. Manure promotes plant growth, provides nutritious food to soil organisms, adds genetic and functional diversity to soils and improves the chemical and physical soil properties. However, it can also cause pollution by introducing toxic elements (i.e., heavy metals, antibiotics, pathogens) and contribute to nutrient losses. Soil organisms play an essential role in manure transformation into the soil and the degradation of any potential toxic constitutes; however, manure management practices often neglect soil biodiversity. In this review, we explored the impact of manure from farmed animals on soil biodiversity by considering factors that determine the effects of manure and vice versa. By evaluating manure's potential to enhance soil biodiversity, but also its environmental risks, we assessed current and future EU policy and legislations with the ultimate aim of providing recommendations that can enable a more sustainable management of farm manures. This review explored the relationship between manure and soil biodiversity by considering 407 published papers and relevant legislative provisions. In addition, we evaluated whether benefits and risks on soil biodiversity are considered in manure management. Thereafter, we analysed the current legislation in the European Union relevant to manure, an important driver for its treatment, application and storage. This review found that coupling manure management with soil biodiversity can mitigate present and future environmental risks. Our analyses showed that manure quality is more important to soil biodiversity than manure quantity and therefore, agricultural practices that protect and promote soil biodiversity with the application of appropriate, high-quality manure or biostimulant preparations based on manure, could accelerate the move towards more sustainable food production systems. Soil biodiversity needs to be appropriately factored in when assessing manure amendments to provide better guidelines on the use of manure and to reduce costs and environmental risks. However, radical changes in current philosophies and practices are needed so that soil biodiversity can be enhanced by manure management. Manure quality in the EU requires greater attention, calling for more targeted policies. Our proposed approach could be applied by European Union Member States to include soil protection measures in national legislation, and at the EU level, can enable the implementation of strategic goals.",

    "abstract": "Beef cattle have been identified as the largest livestock-sector contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using life cycle analysis (LCA), several studies have concluded that grass-finished beef systems have greater GHG intensities than feedlot-finished (FL) beef systems. These studies evaluated only one grazing management system – continuous grazing – and assumed steady-state soil carbon (C), to model the grass-finishing environmental impact. However, by managing for more optimal forage growth and recovery, adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing can improve animal and forage productivity, potentially sequestering more soil organic carbon (SOC) than continuous grazing. To examine impacts of AMP grazing and related SOC sequestration on net GHG emissions, a comparative LCA was performed of two different beef finishing systems in the Upper Midwest, USA: AMP grazing and FL. We used on-farm data collected from the Michigan State University Lake City AgBioResearch Center for AMP grazing. Impact scope included GHG emissions from enteric methane, feed production and mineral supplement manufacture, manure, and on-farm energy use and transportation, as well as the potential C sink arising from SOC sequestration. Across-farm SOC data showed a 4-year C sequestration rate of 3.59 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in AMP grazed pastures. After including SOC in the GHG footprint estimates, finishing emissions from the AMP system were reduced from 9.62 to −6.65 kg CO2-e kg carcass weight (CW)−1, whereas FL emissions increased slightly from 6.09 to 6.12 kg CO2-e kg CW−1 due to soil erosion. This indicates that AMP grazing has the potential to offset GHG emissions through soil C sequestration, and therefore the finishing phase could be a net C sink. However, FL production required only half as much land as AMP grazing. While the SOC sequestration rates measured here were relatively high, lower rates would still reduce the AMP emissions relative to the FL emissions. This research suggests that AMP grazing can contribute to climate change mitigation through SOC sequestration and challenges existing conclusions that only feedlot-intensification reduces the overall beef GHG footprint through greater productivity.",

    "abstract": "Food systems worldwide are under enormous pressure. Over the past decades, local food systems have been promoted by governments and civil society organisations as a lever for change towards more inclusive, resilient and sustainable food systems based on the belief of their many purported benefits. The goal of this article is to test eight common beliefs on local food systems – from a consumer, farmer, community and environmental perspective – against scientific evidence, with a focus on North America and Europe. We conduct a systematic multi-disciplinary literature review and identify 123 peer-reviewed studies on local food systems. We find that the impact of local food systems on different social, economic and environmental factors highly depends on the type of supply chain under assessment, with important differences across product types and countries. Hence, our review refutes the idea that local food is inherently good. In addition, we highlight the confusion surrounding the definition of a local food scale and point out a critical lack of cross-country comparable data hindering the possibility of drawing generalisable conclusions on the benefits and drawbacks of local food systems. A comprehensive review of multi-disciplinary scientific evidence confirming (or refuting) claims on local food systems was missing, leading to possible counter-productive policies. Based on our findings, we suggest that policy-makers should invest in cross-country comparable data collection on local food systems (especially in Europe), which would allow the scientific community to perform robust causal analyses on their impacts on society.",

    "abstract": "A meta-analysis specially based on tree crops was conducted to evaluate the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), soil N and P, and crop yield in a Mediterranean climate, which are affected by: (i) management practices (crop diversification, tillage, fertilization); (ii) environmental characteristics, such as soil clay and climatic variables; and (iii) study length. The aim of this study was to assess the benefits of crop diversification, conservation tillage (minimum tillage/no-tillage) and organic fertilization as alternatives to intensive conventional mono-cropping in field studies. All the diversified systems and conservation tillage systems and the use of organic fertilizers induced positive effects on SOC. The highest response in SOC was achieved by the growth of permanent crops in the alleys. Soil N showed a similar trend to that of SOC, but the effect of no-tillage was not significant compared to conventional tillage. No significant effect was observed in soil P except for the cultivation of permanent crops in the alleys, which had a negative effect. No effect was observed in tree crop yield due to the growth of alley crops, conservation tillage or organic fertilization. However, the response of crop yield was related to the specific climatic conditions of each region, with possible negative effects in warm and dry areas. Overall, the use of intercropping, conservation tillage and organic fertilization led to improvements in soil quality and fertility and maintenance of a ground cover that can protect soil. However, to avoid possible negative effects on soil P and N availability, the growth of annual alley crops with minimum tillage is suggested instead of permanent crops with no-tillage, especially in dry and warm areas. Our results also suggested that the soil properties evaluated were not the main drivers of long-term yield variability.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural modeling has long suffered from fragmentation in model implementation. Many models are developed, there is much redundancy, models are often poorly coupled, model component re-use is rare, and it is frequently difficult to apply models to generate real solutions for the agricultural sector. To improve this situation, we argue that an open, self-sustained, and committed community is required to co-develop agricultural models and associated data and tools as a common resource. Such a community can benefit from recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT). We examine how such developments can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, and decision support tools for agricultural production systems. Our objective is to assess relevant technologies for their maturity, expected development, and potential to benefit the agricultural modeling community. The technologies considered encompass methods for collaborative development and for involving stakeholders and users in development in a transdisciplinary manner. Our qualitative evaluation suggests that as an overall research challenge, the interoperability of data sources, modular granular open models, reference data sets for applications and specific user requirements analysis methodologies need to be addressed to allow agricultural modeling to enter in the big data era. This will enable much higher analytical capacities and the integrated use of new data sources. Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating those who develop applications of their models. This adoption requires the widespread uptake of a set of best practices as standard operating procedures.",

    "abstract": "The environmental impacts of beef cattle production and their effects on the overall sustainability of beef have become a national and international concern. Our objective was to quantify important environmental impacts of beef cattle production in the United States. Surveys and visits of farms, ranches and feedlots were conducted throughout seven regions (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northern Plains, Southern Plains, Northwest and Southwest) to determine common practices and characteristics of cattle production. These data along with other information sources were used to create about 150 representative production systems throughout the country, which were simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model using local soil and climate data. The simulations quantified the performance and environmental impacts of beef cattle production systems for each region. A farm-gate life cycle assessment was used to quantify resource use and emissions for all production systems including traditional beef breeds and cull animals from the dairy industry. Regional and national totals were determined as the sum of the production system outputs multiplied by the number of cattle represented by each simulated system. The average annual greenhouse gas and reactive N emissions associated with beef cattle production over the past five years were determined to be 243 ± 26 Tg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and 1760 ± 136 Gg N, respectively. Total fossil energy use was found to be 569 ± 53 PJ and blue water consumption was 23.2 ± 3.5 TL. Environmental intensities expressed per kg of carcass weight produced were 21.3 ± 2.3 kg CO2e, 155 ± 12 g N, 50.0 ± 4.7 MJ, and 2034 ± 309 L, respectively. These farm-gate values are being combined with post farm-gate sources of packing, processing, distribution, retail, consumption and waste handling to produce a full life cycle assessment of U.S. beef. This study is the most detailed, yet comprehensive, study conducted to date to provide baseline measures for the sustainability of U.S. beef.",

    "abstract": "Adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies are expected to help transform current agricultural systems towards sustainability. To enable and steer transformation we need to understand the mechanisms of adoption and diffusion holistically. Our current understanding is mainly informed by empirical farm-level adoption studies and by agent-based models simulating systemic diffusion mechanisms. These two approaches are weakly integrated. Our objective is to build an empirically grounded conceptual framework for adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies by synthesizing literature on these alternative approaches. We review 32 empirical farm-level studies on the adoption of precision and digital farming technologies and 27 agent-based models on the diffusion of agricultural innovations. Empirical findings are synthesized in terms of significance and partially standardized coefficients, and diffusion studies are categorized by their approaches and theoretical frameworks. We show that farm-level studies focus on farm and operator characteristics but pay less attention to attributes of technology, interactions, institutional and psychological factors. Agent-based models, despite their usefulness for representing system interaction, only loosely connect with empirical farm-level findings. Based on the identified gaps, we develop a conceptual framework integrating farm-level evidence on adoption with a systemic perspective on technology diffusion. Our empirically grounded conceptual framework is the first holistic approach to connect the dots between the wealth of empirical research on technology adoption with more model-driven investigation of innovation diffusion in agent-based studies. Focusing on digital farming technologies, it may serve as a reference for those studying the adoption and diffusion of such technologies beyond farm scale. Furthermore, this framework can be the basis for contextual applications to inform policy-makers trying to foster the diffusion of suitable digital technologies through interventions as it highlights where policy can impact important aspects of adoption via relevant processes of diffusion.",

    "abstract": "Approaches that aim to identify and prioritize locally appropriate climate smart agriculture (CSA) technologies will need to address the context-specific multi-dimensional complexity in agricultural systems. The climate smart agriculture rapid appraisal (CSA-RA) is a mixed method approach that draws on participatory bottom-up, qualitative, and quantitative tools to assess the heterogeneity of local contexts, and prioritize context-specific CSA options. This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the COP21 agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and CSA priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones. Thus, the CSA-RA allows stakeholders to simultaneously take into account biophysical and socio-economic aspects to target and implement CSA. • CSA-RA: tool to prioritize context specific climate smart agriculture technologies • Novel mixed method approach employing participatory, qualitative, and quantitative tools • Innovative combination of gender-disaggregated methods and climate analysis • Bottom-up approach, incorporating multiple scales and actors • Rapid and comprehensive",

Despite much effort to identify the best drought indicator to represents the occurrence of drought impacts in a particular sector, there is still no consensus among the scientific community on this. Using a more detailed and extensive impact dataset than in previous studies, this paper assesses the regional relationship between drought impacts occurrence in British agriculture and two of the most commonly used drought indices (SPI and SPEI). The largest qualitative dataset on reported drought impacts on British agriculture for the period 1975–2012 spanning all major recent droughts was collated. Logistic regression using generalised additive models was applied to investigate the association between drought indices and reported impacts at the regional level. Results show that SPEI calculated for the preceding six months is the best indicator to predict the probability of drought impacts on agriculture in the UK, although the variation in the response to SPEI6 differed between regions. However, this variation appears to result both from the method by which SPEI is derived, which means that similar values of the index equate to different soil moisture conditions in wet and dry regions, and from the variation in agriculture between regions. The study shows that SPEI alone has limited value as an indicator of agricultural droughts in heterogeneous areas and that such results cannot be usefully extrapolated between regions. However, given the drought sensitivity of agriculture, the integration of regional predictions within drought monitoring and forecasting would help to reduce the large on-farm economic damage of drought and increase the sector's resilience to future drought.",

    "abstract": "Automated monitoring of the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is a key to transform the labor-intensive, experience-based decision making to an automatic, data-driven approach in agricultural production. Growers could make better management decisions by leveraging the real-time field data while researchers could utilize these data to answer key scientific questions. Traditionally, data collection in agricultural fields, which largely relies on human labor, can only generate limited numbers of data points with low resolution and accuracy. During the last two decades, crop monitoring has drastically evolved with the advancement of modern sensing technologies. Most importantly, the introduction of IoT (Internet of Things) into crop, soil, and microclimate sensing has transformed crop monitoring into a quantitative and data-driven work from a qualitative and experience-based task. Ag-IoT systems enable a data pipeline for modern agriculture that includes data collection, transmission, storage, visualization, analysis, and decision-making. This review serves as a technical guide for Ag-IoT system design and development for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. It highlighted Ag-IoT platforms presented in 115 academic publications between 2011 and 2021 worldwide. These publications were analyzed based on the types of sensors and actuators used, main control boards, types of farming, crops observed, communication technologies and protocols, power supplies, and energy storage used in Ag-IoT platforms. The result showed that 33 variables measured by various sensors were demonstrated in these studies while 10 actuations were successfully integrated with Ag-IoT platforms. Perennial crops, which introduced less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual crops, were selected by 64% of researchers. Furthermore, studies in Ag-IoT system development were more focused on outdoor than indoor environments. Ag-IoT systems based on Arduino were most common among the studies while commercial platforms were least adopted, likely due to their inflexibility in customized developments. More researchers focused on agricultural applications than the IoT technology itself. Soil water content-based irrigation scheduling and controlled environment monitoring and controlling were the main applications. Other application areas included soil nutrient estimation, crop monitoring based on multiple vegetation indices, pest identification, and chemigation. Several potential future research directions were identified at the end of the review, including integration of satellite-based internet connectivity to improve the IoT networks in non-connected farms, development of mobile IoT platforms (drones and autonomous ground vehicles) with continuous connectivity, and the use of edge-computing and machine-learning/deep-learning to enhance the capability of the Ag-IoT systems.",

    "abstract": "There is great untapped potential for farm mechanization to support rural development initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. As technology transfer of large machinery from high-income countries was ineffective during the 1980s and 90s, mechanization options were developed appropriate to resource poor farmers cultivating small and scattered plots. More recently, projects that aim to increase the adoption of farm machinery have tended to target service providers rather than individual farmers. This paper uses the Scaling Scan tool to assess three project case studies designed to scale different Mechanization Service Provider Models (MSPMs) in Mexico, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. It provides a useful framework to assess the gap between international lessons learned on scaling captured in forty tactical questions over ten \"scaling ingredients\" as perceived by stakeholders involved in the projects, as well as private sector actors and government employees. Although at first sight the case studies seem to successfully reach high numbers of end users, the assessment exposes issues around the sustainable and transformative nature of the interventions. These are highly influenced by the design of the projects and by the environment and context of the intervention areas. Across the three case studies, large-scale adoption of the models was found to be hampered by lack of finance to set up MSPMs and insufficient collaboration among the value chain actors to strengthen and foster Mechanization Service Provider (MSP) entrepreneurs. Applying a scaling perspective on each case study project exposed important lessons on minimizing project dependencies. Positive examples include integration of capacity development materials in vocational training centers in Zimbabwe, promotion of MSPMs by other donors in East Africa and levering of nearly USD six million of private sector investment in appropriate machinery in Bangladesh. On the other hand, there is still a high dependency on the projects in terms of coaching of service providers, facilitating collaboration along the value chain, and provision of leadership and advocacy to address issues at governance level. These results have important implications for similar development interventions aimed at increasing smallholder access to mechanization services at scale and is to our knowledge the first cross-continental assessment of these issues to date.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) indicators are key for characterizing farm performance, because of the role of N in food production and environmental sustainability. A systematic monitoring of N balance at the farm level could contribute to understanding differences in N management and impacts among farms and among regions. The objective of this study was to increase the understanding of differences in N indicators at the farm level across Europe, and to derive possible target values. Farm-level data were collected through surveys of 1240 farms from Atlantic, Continental and Mediterranean Europe, that were diverse rather tahn country representative. The data were analysed according to a common procedure, using three related indicators: N use efficiency (NUE, farm-gate ratio of N outputs to N inputs), N surplus and N output in agricultural products. Specific target values were derived for farm type (arable, dairy, pig and mixed farms) based on the statistical analysis of the data set. The effect of not accounting for N losses involved in the production of purchased feed and the end use of exported manure (externalisation) on the animal farm indicators was evaluated by recalculating inputs with adjusting factors. The results show a wide variation in NUE and N surplus, mainly related to differences in farming systems and management. Arable farms presented lower mean N input and surplus than livestock farms, and therefore had the highest median NUE. The modest targets (i.e. median of data) for arable farms were NUE 61% and N surplus 68 kg N ha−1, for dairy farms NUE 30% and N surplus 155 kg N ha−1, and for pig farms NUE 40% and N surplus 135 kg N ha−1. Externalisation had a large effect on animal farm indicators. After adjusting for externalisation, the modest target NUE for dairy farms was 19% and for pig farms 23%. Farms outside their agro-environmental optimum could approach their specific targets by increasing or reducing N inputs (intensification or extensification) or adopting additional strategies (sustainable intensification). In conclusion, N indicators were useful to compare farm performance among different farming systems and to define a characteristic operating space for a farm population, but caution should be taken when comparing livestock farms before externalisation adjustment, and consideration should be given to changes in soil N stocks. Farm system-specific targets for N indicators and linkages with the Common Agricultural Policy may create the necessary incentives to optimise NUE and reduce N losses to air and water.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture plays a central role in the European Green Deal with various policies and strategies converging to promote sustainable agriculture and food systems. The Farm to Fork strategy approaches agriculture from a sustainable food systems perspective. Sustainable agriculture is also central in the European Biodiversity strategy, in the Long-term vision for EU Rural areas and in the Soil strategy. Despite clear policy objectives, there is still a long way towards an effective transition towards sustainable agriculture based on integrated, science based, solutions. This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the challenges and opportunities for the transition towards a sustainable agriculture in Europe, the role of European policies and practical approaches. We reviewed policy documents, scientific literature and global data to reflect on the vision of the Farm to Fork and other European strategies affecting sustainable agriculture, focussing on which policy instruments are foreseen to reach their objectives, which are the key-challenges related to achieve more sustainable farming, and on possible approaches to attain sustainable agriculture. We provide an overview of synergies and shared objectives between different European policies and strategies aiming to support the transition to sustainable agriculture from environmental, social and economic perspectives. We identified several often reported challenges to attain sustainable food systems: reduced yields, increased land demand, nitrogen needs, changes in diet, food waste, distribution and access to food, and externalities to third countries. Finally, we discuss two main approaches to sustainable agriculture with potential complementarity to fulfil the objectives of sustainable agriculture as reflected in the different European policies and strategies. Sustainable intensification with focus on environmental- friendly production, and agroecology with focus on ecology, social justice and food sovereignty. We reflect on how both approaches can be integrated to create synergies and optimize delivery of multiple ecosystem services. The transformation to sustainable agriculture, as expected from the several revised strategies, is not just a technical question of farming practices, but requires a holistic approach considering social, economic, cultural, technical and environmental aspects. Local adaptations, stakeholder participation, and recognition that agriculture produces more than crops, are key to support this transition of agriculture and food systems. The transition towards more sustainable agriculture requires alignment of policies related to social, economic and environmental aspects, including social and economic acknowledgment to farmers, as managers of agroecosystems and cultural landscapes delivering a range of ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Since 1980, China has made impressive progress in increasing agricultural production, improving food security and reducing rural poverty. Increased use of chemical fertilizer has played a vital role in this, but presently fertilizer overuse is posing severe challenges for the environment and human health. In response to this, the Chinese government has announced policies to reduce chemical fertilizer use, while at the same time supporting rural incomes and maintaining food self-sufficiency in major grains. The objective of the paper is to assess the effectiveness of these policies in reducing the nutrient surpluses, maintaining food self-sufficiency and supporting rural incomes throughout China. We use a spatially and socially detailed general equilibrium model of the Chinese economy to simulate the potential impact of these policies on agricultural production, environmental pollution and rural incomes. The scenarios are developed in a step-wise fashion to show the contribution of specific measures included in the policies. Our main results are that nitrate surpluses can be reduced by more than 50% and phosphate surpluses even by more than 75% without significant negative impacts on China's food self-sufficiency, provided that the government adopts appropriate policy combinations. At the same time, the income of the average crop farmer goes up slightly compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, the spatial variability is large, requiring supplementary targeted income support measures, particularly in poverty-stricken provinces like Shaanxi, Chongqing, Guizhou and Yunnan where also the income gains of the new policies are below average. The results show that appropriate policy combinations should address both the efficiency of chemical fertilizer use and the intensity of organic fertilizer use. Hence, substantial efforts are necessary in mobilizing stakeholder involvement in implementing the policies.",

    "abstract": "Climate uncertainty challenges the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Awareness of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices and access to climate-smart technologies are key factors in determining the utilization of farm and land management practices that may simultaneously decrease greenhouse gas emissions, increase the adaptive capacity of farmers, and improve food security. Understanding how biophysical and socio-economic constraints affect the adoption of CSA practices and technologies plays an essential role in policy and intervention planning. Our objective was to identify these constraints among smallholder farmers in Taita Taveta County of Southeast Kenya across varying agro-ecological zones. We conducted a Climate-Smart Agriculture Rapid Appraisal that consisted of four mostly gender-disaggregated smallholder farmer workshops (102 participants), a household survey (65 participants), key-informant interviews (16 informants), and four transect walks. Our results indicate a dissonance in the perceived awareness of CSA practices and utilization of CSA technologies between state actors and farmers. State actors emphasize lack of awareness as a barrier to adoption, while farmers express knowledgeability regarding environmental change and climate-smart practices but are confined by limitations and restrictions posed by e.g. market mechanisms, land tenure issues, and lack of resources. These restrictions include e.g. uncertainty in product prices, lack of land ownership, scarcity of arable land, and simply lack of capital or willingness to invest. Farmers are further challenged by the emergence of new pests and human–wildlife conflicts. Our research findings are based on the contextual settings of Taita Taveta County, but the results indicate that adopting CSA practices and utilizing technologies, especially in sub-Saharan regions that are heavily based on subsistence agriculture with heterogenous agro-ecological zones, require localized and gender-responsive solutions in policy formation and planning of both agricultural extension services and development interventions that take into account the agency of the farmers. This study contributes to existing climate change adaptation research by increasing our understanding of how physical and socio-economic constraints can affect the adoption of new farm and land management practices, and how CSA-based intervention strategies could be restructured by local stakeholders to be more inclusive. • Awareness and access are key factors in determining utilization of climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies. • Objective was to identify climate-smart agriculture constraints among farmers in Taita Taveta County of South-East Kenya. • The study applied Climate-Smart Agriculture Rapid Appraisal. • Climate-smart agriculture require more localized solutions in policies, extension services and development interventions. • This study increases understanding of constraints affecting adoption of new farm and land management practices.",

    "abstract": "Declining water quantity and quality and poor land, water, and crop management practices are leading to increasing soil salinity, land degradation, desertification, and threatening the overall sustainability of the crop production system in irrigated drylands. Assessments of salinity dynamics and sustainability indicators under alternative agricultural practices are needed to identify the right combination of practices that improve sustainability while minimizing land and environmental degradation. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of conservation agriculture (CA)-based practices, water-saving irrigation, water quality, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for improving the sustainability of rice-wheat (RWS) and cotton-wheat (CWS) systems in salt-affected irrigated drylands. The study included mixed-method approaches of two years of field experiments, soil profile and groundwater salinity simulation using Hydrus-1D model, and multi-criteria trade-off analysis for the holistic assessment of alternative innovations in RWS and CWS. The treatments in experiments were composed of a combination of CA-based practices, water-saving irrigation and N rates. Fourteen sustainability indicators computed from experiments and simulation were compared to evaluate the sustainability of those cropping systems and to reveal the potential of those practices for improving sustainability. Compared to the initial conditions, the soil salinity decreased in both cropping systems, while the reduction rate was much higher in RWS than CWS (by 28%). In RWS, the conventional treatment had the lowest salinity level, while in CWS, CA (permeant bed + residue retention) had the lowest. RWS raised the groundwater table by 25% compared to CWS. The long-term scenario analysis with Hydrus-1D demonstrated that, with increased irrigation water salinity and soil evaporation rates, soil profile salinity increases by 78% in RWS and 66% in CWS. RWS had a higher net profit (+81%) and soil organic carbon (SOC) (-15%), but lower water productivity (WP) (−147%), nitrogen, and energy use efficiency (EUE) (−46%) than CWS. The CA-based practices in CWS improved sustainability indicators with higher yield and net profit (+20%), WP (+26%), SOC (+456%), and EUE (36%) with decreased soil salinity than in the conventional system. The study attempts to assess the effectiveness of resource conservation technologies such as choice of crop species and cropping systems, and tillage and water and fertilizer management practices for improving sustainability. This study showed the significance of agronomic, soil, and water management practices for minimizing soil salinity. Further, the findings from this study strongly demonstrated the role of CA in sustainable agricultural production particularly under CWS in salt-affected irrigated dryland.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean basin and specifically Northeast Italy are recognised as climate change hotspots. The latter is a key socio-economic area in Europe among the most agriculturally productive. However, increasingly frequent drought periods (typical of drier climates) are threatening agriculture. An extreme event occurred in the summer of 2022. It dramatically affected northern Italy, through high temperatures, water shortages and indirect processes (such as saltwater intrusion in the Po River Delta). The objective is to map and quantify the agricultural areas in Northeast Italy at risk of climate zone shift due to human-induced climate change, providing a comprehensive overview of the main threatened agricultural systems and supporting the use of projections through historical data analysis. We compared the distribution of current (1980 > 2016) and future (2071 > 2100; RCP8.5 scenario) climate zones for 8 main agricultural systems in 14 key provinces in Northeast Italy. Further analyses were performed on historical data to support future climate projections and to analyse agricultural drought during extreme events: (1) a multi-temporal Aridity Index (AI) to investigate aridification dynamics; (2) a focus on the 2022 event (drought and temperature extremes, a situation that is likely to occur more often in the future), combining a Vegetation Health Index (VHI) with a zonal investigation of high Land Surface Temperature (LST); (3) a climate focus for the Po River Delta cultural landscape. The results show that the climate in Northeast Italy is evolving towards drier conditions, posing a challenge to agriculture. The Adriatic coast could become an Arid zone, a finding in line with historical observations. Rice fields will be most at risk (76% of their surface could become Arid in the future), as well as the irrigated lands that are essential for food security (around 20% expected in the Arid zone). Worthy is what is foreseen for crops on slopes (often not irrigated), which may experience drier summers (60% of the surface). We identified the areas at risk of climate change at the farm scale in Northeast Italy, mapping where the threatened fields are located, what their extent is, and which agricultural systems are currently implemented. Such information would facilitate early action, guiding large-scale planning towards more resilient agriculture. Findings could promote sustainable water management plans, open the debate on which crops are worth growing based on future climate, and inspire more localised studies in the design of mitigation measures.",

    "abstract": "Farm typologies help to identify patterns across a wide range of farm systems and describe heterogeneity in agriculture concisely. They can also support the design of agricultural policies by providing information and knowledge about policy target groups. For example, voluntary agri-environmental schemes could be tailored to specific agricultural landscapes and farm types. Farm typologies, however, are often developed from scratch, with limited connection to previous studies and policy making. The objective of this study is to clarify the purposes of farm typologies in research and agricultural policy making and to develop a framework that allows to increase the usefulness and usability of farm typologies for agricultural policy making. Based on a review of 13 systematically identified overview studies on farm typologies, we develop a framework that establishes connections between the purposes of farm typologies along the different stages of the policy process. We find multiple purposes for farm typologies, the two most common of which are for understanding the characteristics, heterogeneity, and development of farm systems and for policy making. The newly developed framework suggests that connecting knowledge across these purposes could improve the validity, transferability, and relevance of farm typologies for agricultural policy making. Our framework also provides an entry point for encouraging cooperation between developers and users of typologies, and for the improvement of typologies through new data (including behavioural data) and methods such as machine learning. We conclude that future research can build on the existing work on farm typologies but must be aware of the specific challenges that are associated with the use of farm typologies in the policy process. Knowledge of the prospects and challenges of using farm typologies allows to increase the usefulness and usabilityof these typologies and can contribute to the design of targeted and tailored agricultural policy instruments. By increasing the acceptance, perceived fairness, and legitimacy, this can improve their effectiveness and efficiency, which is urgently needed for a successful transformation to a more sustainable agricultural sector.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: European countries have set ambitious targets to reduce the risks of pesticide use. Achieving these targets will require a large proportion of farmers to adopt sustainable crop protection practices. However, how to enable this transition and what are the best policies to support farmers remain open questions. OBJECTIVE: Here, we provide a coherent review of existing evidence and new insights into farmer decision-making and policy analysis in the context of the transition to more sustainable crop protection. We synthesise and extend the empirical evidence and the conceptual and methodological foundations to examine farmers' decisions to adopt sustainable crop protection and to assess the potential of different policy measures to support this transition. Our analysis focuses on European agriculture. METHODS: We provide a framework and synthesise evidence by reviewing the literature and combining agronomic and economic perspectives. We focus on three issues: i) indicators for empirical analyses of adoption of sustainable crop protection practices; ii) behavioural perspectives on farmer adoption; iii) insights into methodological approaches for assessing adoption of sustainable crop protection practices and related policies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We have identified four main findings and implications. First, sustainable crop protection practices consist of combinations and bundles of individual measures that are not currently regularly considered in policy instruments and policy analysis. Second, definitions of adoption should move from simple adoption metrics to impacts, for example on pesticide risk reduction. Third, behavioural factors are highly relevant to farmers' adoption decisions, but are currently under-researched and under-represented in the field of sustainable crop protection practices. Fourth, the tools currently used for policy analysis do not allow these key aspects to be represented. We draw policy conclusions. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses help guide policy decisions to achieve pesticide use and risk reduction objectives, and have implications for pesticide policy in Europe and beyond. We identify gaps in current conceptual and methodological approaches, promising avenues for future research, and ways to make results more coherent and comparable. Our analysis thus provides new insights and templates to guide future research and policy analysis on the adoption of sustainable crop protection approaches.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to translate resilience thinking theory into farming systems design practice, this paper examines fundamental properties of complex systems dynamics and their relation with the mechanisms that govern resilience and transformability in African smallholder agriculture. Agroecosystems dynamics emerge from the aggregation of diverse livelihood strategies in response to changes in the agroecosystem context, and are characterised by non-linearity, irreversibility, convergence/divergence and hysteresis. I examine a number of case studies from Africa to verify three guiding hypotheses in connection to the diversity of rural livelihood strategies: (1) diversity as alternative system regimes; (2) diversity as the result of transformability; (3) diversity determined by changing agricultural contexts. The hierarchy of constraints that determine the space for manoeuvring in agroecosystems is described through the analogy of the Matryoshka nesting dolls: each system level confines and is confined by their immediate sub- and supra-systems. Agricultural contexts, as defined by agro-ecological potential, demography and market connectivity are also dynamic and their trajectory can be described as shifts across stability domains. An example from Kenya shows that household diversity can be described as alternative system regimes, through hysteretic rather than continuous, reversible models. In some particular cases diversity emerges from divergent pathways that may have implied radical transformations in the past, as shown here for rural livelihoods in northern Cameroun. A comparative analysis of East African agroecosystems shows that thresholds in specific variables that may point to the existence of possible tipping points are rather elusive and largely site specific, requiring systematic categorisation of agricultural contexts. While agroecology needs to provide the knowledge base for the ecological intensification of smallholder landscapes, policy and market developments are needed to deal with the Matryoshka effect – or with interactions that are presumably panarchical in certain cases. Desirable shifts in farming systems can only be stimulated by working on both ends simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Flooded rice fields can provide habitats for wetland species and ecosystem services similar to those of natural wetlands. During the last three decades, however, farming practices and management systems have been intensified in many rice-producing countries. In addition, more recent socioeconomic changes have caused agricultural abandonment in some parts of East and Southeast Asian countries such as Japan. This study reviewed long-term statistics on rice farming, as well as the impact of agricultural intensification and abandonment on farmland biodiversity at multiple spatial scales in Japan. The impact of pesticide use was greatest in the 1950s–1970s, when the use of highly toxic agents had not yet been prohibited. More recently, different components of agricultural intensification have been the largest threat for various taxa, for example, chemical pesticides for aquatic plants and invertebrates and modern efficient irrigation/drainage systems for amphibians, fishes, and waterbirds. The negative impacts of agricultural abandonment on farmland species have been rapidly increasing with the expansion of abandoned fields and the subsequent vegetation succession and loss of habitat heterogeneity. We also discuss the effectiveness of environmentally friendly farming practices, including the reduced use of pesticides, winter paddy flooding, and installation of fishways, to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on farmland species in rice-paddy landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Justifiable usage of large-scale crop model simulations requires transparent, comprehensive and spatially extensive evaluations of their performance and associated accuracy. Simulated crop yields of a Pan-European implementation of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) crop model were satisfactorily evaluated with reported regional yield data from EUROSTAT for four major crops, including winter wheat, rainfed and irrigated maize, spring barley and winter rye. European-wide land use, elevation, soil and daily meteorological gridded data were integrated in GIS and coupled with EPIC. Default EPIC crop and biophysical process parameter values were used with some minor adjustments according to suggestions from scientific literature. The model performance was improved by spatial calculations of crop sowing densities, potential heat units, operation schedules, and nutrient application rates. EPIC performed reasonable in the simulation of regional crop yields, with long-term averages predicted better than inter-annual variability: linear regression R2 ranged from 0.58 (maize) to 0.91 (spring barley) and relative estimation errors were between ±30% for most of the European regions. The modelled and reported crop yields demonstrated similar responses to driving meteorological variables. However, EPIC performed better in dry compared to wet years. A yield sensitivity analysis of crop nutrient and irrigation management factors and cultivar specific characteristics for contrasting regions in Europe revealed a range in model response and attainable yields. We also show that modelled crop yield is strongly dependent on the chosen PET method. The simulated crop yield variability was lower compared to reported crop yields. This assessment should contribute to the availability of harmonised and transparently evaluated agricultural modelling tools in the EU as well as the establishment of modelling benchmarks as a requirement for sound and ongoing policy evaluations in the agricultural and environmental domains.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS). RAAIS is a diagnostic tool that can guide the analysis of complex agricultural problems and innovation capacity of the agricultural system in which the complex agricultural problem is embedded. RAAIS focuses on the integrated analysis of different dimensions of problems (e.g. biophysical, technological, socio-cultural, economic, institutional and political), interactions across different levels (e.g. national, regional, local), and the constraints and interests of different stakeholder groups (farmers, government, researchers, etc.). Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. RAAIS combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of RAAIS to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.",

    "abstract": "The potential for tree components of coffee agroforestry systems to provide ecosystem services is widely recognized. Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge – as opposed to global scientific understanding – underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction. The effects of shade trees on biophysical conditions and their interactions with coffee productivity were well understood by farmers. They recorded and classified shade trees as 'fresh' (suitable for integration with coffee) or 'hot' (unsuitable) based on their leaf texture and size, foliage density, crown shape, and root system attributes. The fresh/hot classification significantly related to positive/negative provision of services. This classification was widely used by farmers, and unknown by coffee technicians. Detailed local knowledge included several different topics, such as the role of trees in soil formation and in abundance of pollinators. Farmers were also aware of the influence of these ecosystem services on crop productivity. Generally, management decisions were made to maintain coffee productivity rather than ecosystem services. Based on these results, it is suggested that technical interventions addressing the improvement of coffee plantations are more likely to be successful if they take into account not only the scientific information on agroforestry interactions but also the knowledge possessed by farmers. Lack of comprehension of local coffee knowledge could be expected to reduce the success of development programs and projects aimed at improving productivity or other ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Crop models are used for an increasingly broad range of applications, with a commensurate proliferation of methods. Careful framing of research questions and development of targeted and appropriate methods are therefore increasingly important. In conjunction with the other authors in this special issue, we have developed a set of criteria for use of crop models in assessments of impacts, adaptation and risk. Our analysis drew on the other papers in this special issue, and on our experience in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 and the MACSUR, AgMIP and ISIMIP projects. The criteria were used to assess how improvements could be made to the framing of climate change risks, and to outline the good practice and new developments that are needed to improve risk assessment. Key areas of good practice include: i. the development, running and documentation of crop models, with attention given to issues of spatial scale and complexity; ii. the methods used to form crop-climate ensembles, which can be based on model skill and/or spread; iii. the methods used to assess adaptation, which need broadening to account for technological development and to reflect the full range options available. The analysis highlights the limitations of focussing only on projections of future impacts and adaptation options using pre-determined time slices. Whilst this long-standing approach may remain an essential component of risk assessments, we identify three further key components: 1.Working with stakeholders to identify the timing of risks. What are the key vulnerabilities of food systems and what does crop-climate modelling tell us about when those systems are at risk?2.Use of multiple methods that critically assess the use of climate model output and avoid any presumption that analyses should begin and end with gridded output.3.Increasing transparency and inter-comparability in risk assessments. Whilst studies frequently produce ranges that quantify uncertainty, the assumptions underlying these ranges are not always clear. We suggest that the contingency of results upon assumptions is made explicit via a common uncertainty reporting format; and/or that studies are assessed against a set of criteria, such as those presented in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural research for development has made important contributions to poverty reduction and food security over the last 40 years. Nevertheless, it is likely that both the speed of global change and its impacts on natural and socio-economic systems are being under-estimated. Coupled with the moral imperative to justify the use of public resources for which there are multiple, competing claims, research for development needs to become more effective and efficient in terms of contributing towards longer-term development goals. Currently there is considerable debate about the ways in which this may be achieved. Here we describe an approach based on theory of change. This includes a monitoring, evaluation and learning system that combines indicators of progress in research along with indicators of change aimed at understanding the factors that enable or inhibit the behavioural changes that can bring about development impacts. Theory of change represents our best understanding of how engagement and learning can enable change as well as how progress towards outcomes might be measured. We describe the application of this approach and highlight some key lessons learned. Although robust evidence is currently lacking, a theory of change approach appears to have considerable potential to achieve impacts that balance the drive to generate new knowledge in agricultural research with the priorities and urgency of the users and beneficiaries of research results, helping to bridge the gap between knowledge generation and development outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Grassland degradation compromises the profitability of Brazilian livestock production, and pasture recovery is a promising strategy for sustainable intensification of agriculture (SAI). Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program (“Programa ABC”). The model estimates EI using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management. The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from − 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$·ha− 1·yr− 1) to around 300 R$·ha− 1·yr− 1, respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated EI of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO2e/kg CWE) relative to 3.59 kg CO2e/kg CWE for optimized management. Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EI. The results provide evidence to inform the design of Brazil's key domestic policy incentive for low carbon agriculture, which is an important component of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) on emissions mitigation. The results also contribute to the global debate on the interpretation of SAI.",

However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well-established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.",

We identify desirable features for models, and describe some of the potential advances that we envisage for model components and their integration. We propose an implementation strategy that would link a \"pre-competitive\" space for model development to a \"competitive space\" for knowledge product development and through private-public partnerships for new data infrastructure. Specific model improvements would be based on further testing and evaluation of existing models, the development and testing of modular model components and integration, and linkages of model integration platforms to new data management and visualization tools.",

Negative rainfall shocks have heterogeneous effects on crop-specific agricultural productivity and based on geographical zones. We use an instrumental variables regression approach, where agricultural land productivity is instrumented with negative rainfall shocks. A negative rainfall shock decreases agricultural productivity and hence decreases household consumption by 37%. We also show considerable differential impacts of rainfall shocks on household consumption by initial values of wealth and geographical zones. Rainfall shocks have a negative, significant impact for asset-poor and nonpoor households, but has a higher impact on household consumption for asset-poor households. Similarly, it has higher impact for land-poor households and households in northern Nigeria.",

    "abstract": "Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is widely promoted as an approach for reorienting agricultural development under the realities of climate change. Prioritising research-for-development activities is crucial, given the need to utilise scarce resources as effectively as possible. However, no framework exists for assessing and comparing different CSA research investments. Several aspects make it challenging to prioritise CSA research, including its multi-dimensional nature (productivity, adaptation and mitigation), the uncertainty surrounding many climate impacts, and the scale and temporal dependencies that may affect the benefits and costs of CSA adoption. Here we propose a framework for prioritising agricultural research investments across scales and review different approaches to setting priorities among agricultural research projects. Many priority-setting case studies address the short- to medium-term and at relatively local scales. We suggest that a mix of actions that span spatial and temporal time scales is needed to be adaptive to a changing climate, address immediate problems and create enabling conditions for enduring change.",

    "abstract": "One of the great challenges in agricultural development and sustainable intensification is the assurance of social equity in food security oriented interventions. Development practitioners, researchers, and policy makers alike could benefit from prior insight into what interventions or environmental shocks might differentially affect farmers' food security status, in order to move towards more informed and equitable development. We examined the food security status and livelihood activities of 269 smallholder farm households (HHs) in Bihar, India. Proceeding with a four-step analysis, we first applied a multivariate statistical methodology to differentiate five primary farming system types. We next applied an indicator of food security in the form of HH potential food availability (PFA), and examined the contribution of crop, livestock, and on- and off-farm income generation to PFA within each farm HH type. Lastly, we applied scenario analysis to examine the potential impact of the adoption of 'climate smart' agricultural (CSA) practices in the form of conservation agriculture (CA) and improved livestock husbandry, and environmental shocks on HH PFA. Our results indicate that compared to livestock interventions, CA may hold considerable potential to boost HH PFA, though primarily for wealthier and medium-scale cereal farmers. These farm HH types were however considerably more vulnerable to food insecurity risks resulting from simulated drought, while part-time farmers and resource-poor agricultural laborers generating income from off-farm pursuits were comparatively less vulnerable, due in part to their more diversified income sources and potential to migrate in search of work. Our results underscore the importance of prior planning for development initiatives aimed at increasing smallholder food security while maintaining social equity, while providing a robust methodology to vet the implications of agricultural interventions on an ex ante basis.",

    "abstract": "This study identifies entry points for innovation for sustainable intensification of agricultural systems. An agricultural innovation systems approach is used to provide a holistic image of (relations between) constraints faced by different stakeholder groups, the dimensions and causes of these constraints, and intervention levels, timeframes and types of innovations needed. Our data shows that constraints for sustainable intensification of agricultural systems are mainly of economic and institutional nature. Constraints are caused by the absence, or poor functioning of institutions such as policies and markets, limited capabilities and financial resources, and ineffective interaction and collaboration between stakeholders. Addressing these constraints would mainly require short- and middle-term productivity and institutional innovations, combined with middle- to long-term NRM innovations across farm and national levels. Institutional innovation (e.g. better access to credit, services, inputs and markets) is required to address 69% of the constraints for sustainable intensification in the Central Africa Highlands. This needs to go hand in hand with productivity innovation (e.g. improved knowhow of agricultural production techniques, and effective use of inputs) and NRM innovation (e.g. targeted nutrient applications, climate smart agriculture). Constraint network analysis shows that institutional innovation to address government constraints at national level related to poor interaction and collaboration will have a positive impact on constraints faced by other stakeholder groups. We conclude that much of the R4D investments and innovation in the Central Africa Highlands remain targeting household productivity at farm level. Reasons for that include (1) a narrow focus on sustainable intensification, (2) institutional mandates and pre-analytical choices based project objectives and disciplinary bias, (3) short project cycles that impede work on middle- and long-term NRM and institutional innovation, (4) the likelihood that institutional experimentation can become political, and (5) complexity in terms of expanded systems boundaries and measuring impact.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring crop and rangeland conditions is highly relevant for early warning and response planning in food insecure areas of the world. Satellite remote sensing can obtain relevant and timely information in such areas where ground data are scattered, non-homogenous, or frequently unavailable. Rainfall estimates provide an outlook of the drivers of vegetation growth, whereas time series of satellite-based biophysical indicators at high temporal resolution provide key information about vegetation status in near real-time and over large areas. The new early warning decision support system ASAP (Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production) builds on the experience of the MARS crop monitoring activities for food insecure areas, that have started in the early 2000's and aims at providing timely information about possible crop production anomalies. The information made available on the website (https://mars.jrc.ec.europa.eu/asap/) directly supports multi-agency early warning initiatives such as for example the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor for Early Warning and provides inputs to more detailed food security assessments that are the basis for the annual Global Report on Food Crises. ASAP is a two-step analysis framework, with a first fully automated step classifying the first sub-national level administrative units into four agricultural production deficit warning categories. Warnings are based on rainfall and vegetation index anomalies computed over crop and rangeland areas and are updated every 10 days. They take into account the timing during the crop season at which they occur, using remote sensing derived phenology per-pixel. The second step involves the monthly analysis at country level by JRC crop monitoring experts of all the information available, including the automatic warnings, crop production and food security-tailored media analysis, high-resolution imagery (e.g. Landsat 8, Sentinel 1 and 2) processed in Google Earth Engine and ancillary maps, graphs and statistics derived from a set of indicators. Countries with potentially critical conditions are marked as minor or major hotspots and a global overview is provided together with short national level narratives.",

    "abstract": "Bangladesh faces huge challenges in achieving food security due to its high population, diet changes, and limited room for expanding cropland and cropping intensity. The objective of this study is to assess the degree to which Bangladesh can be self-sufficient in terms of domestic maize, rice and wheat production by the years 2030 and 2050 by closing the existing gap (Yg) between yield potential (Yp) and actual farm yield (Ya), accounting for possible changes in cropland area. Yield potential and yield gaps were calculated for the three crops using well-validated crop models and site-specific weather, management and soil data, and upscaled to the whole country. We assessed potential grain production in the years 2030 and 2050 for six land use change scenarios (general decrease in arable land; declining ground water tables in the north; cropping of fallow areas in the south; effect of sea level rise; increased cropping intensity; and larger share of cash crops) and three levels of Yg closure (1: no yield increase; 2: Yg closure at a level equivalent to 50% (50% Yg closure); 3: Yg closure to a level of 85% of Yp (irrigated crops) and 80% of water-limited yield potential or Yw (rainfed crops) (full Yg closure)). In addition, changes in demand with low and high population growth rates, and substitution of rice by maize in future diets were also examined. Total aggregated demand of the three cereals (in milled rice equivalents) in 2030 and 2050, based on the UN median population variant, is projected to be 21 and 24% higher than in 2010. Current Yg represent 50% (irrigated rice), 48-63% (rainfed rice), 49% (irrigated wheat), 40% (rainfed wheat), 46% (irrigated maize), and 44% (rainfed maize) of their Yp or Yw. With 50% Yg closure and for various land use changes, self-sufficiency ratio will be > 1 for rice in 2030 and about one in 2050 but well below one for maize and wheat in both 2030 and 2050. With full Yg closure, self-sufficiency ratios will be well above one for rice and all three cereals jointly but below one for maize and wheat for all scenarios, except for the scenario with drastic decrease in boro rice area to allow for area expansion for cash crops. Full Yg closure of all cereals is needed to compensate for area decreases and demand increases, and then even some maize and large amounts of wheat imports will be required to satisfy demand in future. The results of this analysis have important implications for Bangladesh and other countries with high population growth rate, shrinking arable land due to rapid urbanization, and highly vulnerable to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Research has identified an urgent need to renew agriculture's traditional design organization and foster more open, decentralized, contextualized and participatory approaches to design and innovation. While the concepts of co-design and co-innovation used in agriculture resemble features of open innovation, they may benefit from 'inbound open innovation' themselves through cross-fertilization with management studies, design science, science and technology studies, and organization studies. This special issue brings together different streams of research providing novel perspectives on co-design and co-innovation in agriculture, including methods, tools and organizations. It compares empirical experiences and theoretical advances to address a variety of issues (e.g., innovation ecosystems, collective design management, participatory design methods, affordances of system analysis tools and network leadership) that shed new light on co-design and co-innovation in support of sustainable agriculture and more broadly transitions towards a diversity of food systems and a circular bioeconomy. This introductory paper presents crosscutting insights and distills from these three directions for future research and practice in agricultural design and innovation: 1) Further opening design and innovation techniques and tools to better account for visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory expressions in evolving designs and what they afford users; 2) Further opening innovation networks in view of creating and stimulating integrative niches that can foster sustainability transitions, which also requires network managers instilling a reflexive stance of network members and broader awareness of power structures attached to organizational, sector and paradigmatic silos in agricultural systems; and 3) Further opening the range of innovation actors to include non-human actants to better account for the agency of the material and ecological.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient recycling is fundamental to sustainable agricultural systems, but few mechanisms exist to ensure that surplus manure nutrients from animal feeding operations are transported for use on nutrient-deficient croplands. As a result, manure nutrients concentrate in locations where they can threaten environmental health and devalue manure as a fertilizer resource. This study advances the concept of the \"manureshed\" – the lands surrounding animal feeding operations onto which manure nutrients can be redistributed to meet environmental, production, and economic goals. Manuresheds can be managed at multiple scales, for example, on farms with both animals and crops, among animal farms and crop farms within a county, or even among animal farms and crop farms in distant counties. With a focus on redistribution among counties, we classified the 3109 counties of the contiguous United States by their capacity to either supply manure phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from confined livestock production (\"sources\") or to assimilate and remove excess P and N via crops (\"sinks\"). Manure nutrient source counties were identified in 40 of the 48 states, with a substantial concentration in the southern US. Source counties for manure P greatly outnumbered source counties for manure N (390 vs. 100), and 99 of the 100 manure N source counties were also source counties for manure P. Conversely, sink counties for manure N outnumbered sink counties for manure P (2766 vs. 2317). We used the P balances of the source and sink counties to delineate four manuresheds dominated by various combinations of confined hog, poultry, dairy, and beef industries. The four manuresheds differed in the transport distances needed to assimilate excess manure P from their respective source areas (from 147 ± 51 km for a beef dominated manureshed to 368 ± 140 km for a poultry dominated manureshed), highlighting the need for systems-level strategies to promote manure nutrient recycling that operate across local, county, regional, and national scales.",

    "abstract": "Central American countries, particularly Guatemala, are experiencing extreme climate events which are disproportionately affecting agriculture and subsequently rural livelihoods. Governments are taking action to address climatic threats, but they need tools to assess the impact of policies and interventions aiming to decrease the impacts of climate change on agriculture. This research, conducted with national policy makers and climate change and agriculture stakeholders in Guatemala, provides a comparative analysis of eight climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and technologies associated with the smallholder maize-beans production system in the Dry Corridor. The practices were identified as high-interest for investment by national stakeholders. CSA practices and technologies aim to improve food security, resilience, and low emissions development, where possible and appropriate. The paper assesses the cost-benefit profile of the introduction of CSA options into farm production systems. Indicators related to profitability and valuation of environmental and social externalities are used to assess options. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is used to address field variability and high uncertainty around parameter values. All practices except one were profitable over their lifecycle, with some practices, expected to be ideal for drought prone areas, presenting a higher risk for adoption. The results were discussed with national stakeholders who established best-bet CSA investment portfolios. This paper argues that a thorough understanding of the costs and benefits of potential CSA options is needed to channel investments effectively and efficiently towards both short- and long-term interventions and should be coupled with broader assessment of tradeoffs between CSA outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The MARS-Crop Yield Forecasting System (M-CYFS) is used since 1993 to forecast the yields of all major crops in the European Union (EU) based on gridded runs of the WOFOST crop model. Using 28 years of observation, from 1988 to 2015, we quantified the variability in crop yield reported by all 28 EU Member States (MS) that can be explained by each individual WOFOST crop model based predictors and a few simple meteorological variables. A linear regression is used as a screening tool to quantify the relationship between each predictor and the yield residuals from the trend throughout the crop cycle for 168 country/crop combinations, assuming the yield residuals from the trend depend on the inter-annual climate variability. The results are plotted and analyzed at different level: every 10 days for each country crop/combination and each predictor; synthetized every 10 days for each country/crop combination keeping the predictor showing the best relationship with the yield residuals; finally, the best predictor found for each MS during the entire growing season is used to evaluate the ability of the model to estimate yield variability of each crop at European scale. While 61% of the grain maize (Zea mays L.) yield variability can be anticipated 80 days before harvest with the simulated water limited biomass for countries where rainfed maize prevails, 41% of the soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield variability can be reproduced a month before harvest, the best estimates being obtained where wheat is predominantly exposed to water stress. For the other crops analyzed, the results are also found to be reliable for crops predominantly exposed to water stress and becoming unreliable in agricultural systems exposed to an oceanic climate with a high level of inputs. The agro-meteorological processes related to an excess of water (nitrogen losses, diseases, anoxia, harvest conditions) would need to be disentangled and better integrated into the crop modeling system to improve the predictors. The monthly cumulated meteorological predictors are performing only slightly worse than the crop model predictors and help to characterize the main processes responsible for the yield variability. Nevertheless, the predictive capacity of the meteorological predictors is spatially and temporally incoherent and differs according to the crop phenology. In comparison, the M-CYFS crop model predictors are more consistent since the predictors summarize the succession of agro-meteorological conditions determining the yield throughout the entire growing season.",

    "abstract": "Scaling of innovations is a key requirement for addressing societal challenges in sectors such as health, agriculture, and the environment. Research for development (R4D) programs, projects and other interventions struggle to make particular innovations go to scale. Current conceptualizations of scaling are often too simplistic; more systemic and multidimensional perspectives, frameworks and measures are needed. There is a gap between new complexity-aware theories and perspectives on innovation, and tools and approaches that can improve strategic and operational decision-making in R4D interventions that aim to scale innovations. This paper aims to bridge that gap by developing the key concepts and measures of Scaling Readiness. Scaling Readiness is an approach that encourages critical reflection on how ready innovations are for scaling and what appropriate actions could accelerate or enhance scaling. Scaling Readiness provides action-oriented support for (1) characterizing the innovation and innovation system; (2) diagnosing the current readiness and use of innovations as a proxy for their readiness to scale; (3) developing strategy to overcome bottlenecks for scaling; (4) facilitating and negotiating multi-stakeholder innovation and scaling processes; and (5) navigating and monitoring the implementation process to allow for adaptive management. Scaling Readiness has the potential to support evidence-based scaling strategy design, implementation and monitoring, and – if applied across multiple interventions – can be used to manage a portfolio of innovation and scaling investments.",

    "abstract": "Countless development projects have piloted solutions that could make a difference if only applied at scale. The reality is that these pilot projects hardly ever reach the intended scale to contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we argue that two major problems undermine efforts to achieve scale in development projects. First, pilot projects are usually set up and managed in very controlled environments that make it very difficult to transition to the real world at scale. Second, poor conceptual and methodological clarity on what scaling is and how it can be pursued often results in a narrow focus on reaching numbers. Counting household adoption at the end of a grant project is a poor metric of whether these people can and will sustain adoption after the project closes, let alone if adoption will reach others and actually contributes to improved livelihoods. We advocate for a broader view on scaling that more accurately reflects the transformational change agenda of the SDGs: from reaching many to a process aiming to achieve sustainable systems change at scale. Sustainable systems change alters a sufficient number of key drivers (incentives, rules, etc.) such that the system that once perpetuated a \"problem\" now instead perpetuates a \"solution.\" This has implications on the way projects are designed and implemented. Rather than focusing on changing conditions within the project context, projects should serve as vehicles for societal change. This means that projects make most sense if designed as part of a multisector, long-term programmatic approach. Treating scaling as a transformation process helps deal with the necessary coevolution of organizational and institutional arrangements, along with the innovations in a technology or practice. To help address scaling, we present a number of frameworks that guide users to assess the scalability of innovations, design for scale from the onset of projects, and systematically think through key elements, ingredients, or success factors. We conclude that scaling requires different skills, approaches, and ways of collaborating than those required for successful implementation of pilot projects. It calls for development actors to have a mindset that allows them to creatively navigate multiple overlapping systems; likewise, they must develop a clear vision about which elements in the system the actors can and cannot address, and about where they need to collaborate strategically to exert influence. Although it is tempting to hope for the silver bullet solution that changes the world, we argue for an approach that takes scaling serious in its own right and recognizes the complexities involved in facilitating a transition to a new \"normal.\"",

    "abstract": "Poverty has many faces and poverty reduction many pathways in different contexts. Lack of food and income interact with lack of access to water, energy, protection from floods, voice, rights and recognition. Among the pathways by which agricultural research can increase rural prosperity, integrated natural resource management deals with a complex nexus of issues, with tradeoffs among issues that are in various stages of denial, recognition, analysis, innovation, scenario synthesis and creation of platforms for (policy) change. Rather than on a portfolio of externally developed 'solutions' ready for adoption and use, the concept of sustainable development may primarily hinge on the strengths and weaknesses of local communities to observe, analyse, innovate, connect, organize collective action and become part of wider coalitions. 'Boundary work' supporting such efforts can help resolve issues in a polycentric governance context, especially where incomplete understanding and knowledge prevent potential win-win alternatives to current lose-lose conflicts to emerge. Integrated research-development approaches deal with context ('theory of place') and options ('theory of change') in multiple ways that vary from selecting sites for studying pre-defined issues to starting from whatever issue deserves prominence in a given location of interest. A knowledge-to-action linkage typology recognizes three situations of increasing complexity. In Type I more knowledge can directly lead to action by a single decision maker; in Type II more knowledge can inform tradeoff decisions, while in Type III negotiation support of multiple knowledge + multiple decision maker settings deals with a higher level of complexity. Current impact quantification can deal with the first, is challenged in the second and inadequate in the third case, dealing with complex social-ecological systems. Impact-oriented funding may focus on Type I and miss the opportunities for the larger ultimate impact of Type II and III involvements.",

    "abstract": "Big data applications in agriculture evolve fast, as more experience, applications, good practices and computational power become available. Actual solutions to real-life problems are scarce. What characterizes the adoption of big data problems to solutions and to what extent is there a match between them? We aim to assess the conditions of the adoption of big data technologies in agricultural applications, based on the investigation of twelve real-life practical use cases in the precision agriculture and livestock domain. We use a mixed method approach: a case study research around the twelve use cases of Horizon 2020 project CYBELE, varying from precision arable and livestock farming to fishing and food security, and a stakeholder survey (n = 56). Our analysis focuses on four perspectives: (1) the drivers of change that initiated the use cases; (2) the big data characteristics of the problem; (3) the technological maturity level of the solution both at start and end of the project; (4) the stakeholder perspective. Results show that the use cases' drivers of change are a combination of data-, technology, research- and commercial interests; most have at least a research drive. The big data characteristics (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) are well-represented, with most emphasis on velocity and variety. Technology readiness levels show that the majority of use cases started at experimental or lab environment stage and aims at a technical maturity of real-world small-scale deployment. Stakeholders' main concern is cost, user friendliness and to embed the solution within their current work practice. The adoption of better-matching big data solutions is modest. Big data solutions do not work out-of-the-box when changing application domains. Additional technology development is needed for addressing the idiosyncrasies of agricultural applications. We add a practical, empirical assessment of the current status of big data problems and solutions to the existing body of mainly theoretical knowledge. We considered the CYBELE research project as our laboratory for this. Our strength is that we interviewed the use case representatives in person, and that we included the stakeholders' perspective in our results. Large-scale deployments need effective interdisciplinary approaches and long-term project horizons to address issues emerging from big data characteristics, and to avoid compartmentalization of agricultural sciences. We need both an engineering perspective – to make things work in practice – and a systems thinking perspective – to offer holistic, integrated solutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework to prioritize locally suitable climate-smart agricultural (CSA) interventions and implementation suitability assessments with key stakeholders: state and district agriculture departments, extension offices, agriculture research institutions, NGOs and donor agencies, private sector and farmers. Prioritization of appropriate interventions for given contexts is needed to assist relevant stakeholders to make strategic decisions and improve adaptability and efficiency of agriculture production system in the face of climate change and variability. First step includes participatory identification and evaluation of location specific CSA interventions suitable for different crop and cropping system with potential to reduce climatic risks in agriculture. All CSA interventions were evaluated based on their contribution to increase farm productivity and income, building resilience to changing climate and reduction of agricultural emissions. Second step includes evaluation of overall implementation feasibility of selected CSA interventions based on their technical feasibility, cost of implementation, inclusivity and synergy with current government programs. In the third step, potential barriers of CSA technology adoption were assessed linking with availability of resources, farmers' knowledge and acceptability, access to agriculture extensions service, market and government support. In the fourth step, incentive mechanisms to promote CSA interventions such as government subsidy, market linkage, provision of loan and capacity building were evaluated with farmers and key stakeholders. Finally, this prioritization framework assessed the role of different organizations such as the government, private sector, non-government organizations, custom hiring centers and community based organizations in promoting CSA interventions at the local level. Results show that this framework provides ample space for local stakeholders to integrate their knowledge and experience on CSA interventions in prioritization and investment planning. Stakeholders prioritized mainly water and nutrient management technologies, agriculture insurance against climatic risks and ICT based weather and agro-advisory services. This framework provides a decision support tool for policy-making in adaptation and mitigation activities in agriculture sector at the local level. This framework can be used by governments, development organizations and the private sector for investment decision-making.",

    "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in relations between nutrient application and crop yield, due to varying inherent soil nutrients supply, soil moisture, crop management and germplasm. This variability affects fertilizer use efficiency and crop productivity. Therefore, development of decision systems that support formulation and delivery of site-specific fertilizer recommendations is important for increased crop yield and environmental protection. Nutrient Expert (NE) is a computer-based decision support system, which enables extension advisers to generate field- or area-specific fertilizer recommendations based on yield response to fertilizer and nutrient use efficiency. We calibrated NE for major maize agroecological zones in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, with data generated from 735 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted between 2015 and 2017. Between 2016 and 2018, 368 NE performance trials were conducted across the three countries in which recommendations generated with NE were evaluated relative to soil-test based recommendations, the current blanket fertilizer recommendations and a control with no fertilizer applied. Although maize yield response to fertilizer differed with geographic location; on average, maize yield response to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were respectively 2.4, 1.6 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Nigeria, 2.3, 0.9 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Ethiopia, and 1.5, 0.8 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Tanzania. Secondary and micronutrients increased maize yield only in specific areas in each country. Agronomic use efficiencies of N were 18, 22 and 13 kg grain kg−1 N, on average, in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively. In Nigeria, NE recommended lower amounts of P by 9 and 11 kg ha−1 and K by 24 and 38 kg ha−1 than soil-test based and regional fertilizer recommendations, respectively. Yet maize yield (4 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Agronomic use efficiencies of P and K (300 and 250 kg kg−1, respectively) were higher with NE than with the blanket recommendation (150 and 70 kg kg−1). In Ethiopia, NE and soil-test based respectively recommended lower amounts of P by 8 and 19 kg ha−1 than the blanket recommendations, but maize yield (6 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Overall, fertilizer recommendations generated with NE maintained high maize yield, but at a lower fertilizer input cost than conventional methods. NE was effective as a simple and cost-effective decision support tool for fine-tuning fertilizer recommendations to farm-specific conditions and offers an alternative to soil testing, which is hardly available to most smallholder farmers.",

With rising new cases of COVID 19 propelling various African governments to enforce strict restrictions of varying degrees to curb the spread. Thus, the pandemic posed unprecedented shocks on agriculture and food supply chains in Sub Saharan Africa. In this study, we use survey data collected from nine countries in Central, Eastern, and Southern, Africa to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 on production, distribution, and consumption of common beans, and possible food security implications. Descriptive analysis of data collected from bean farmers, aggregators, processors, bean regional coordinators, and mechanization dealers reveal that COVID-19 and government restrictions had impacted the availability and cost of farm inputs and labour, distribution, and consumption of beans in Eastern and Southern Africa. The immediate impacts were dire in Southern Africa with Central Africa slightly impacted. The production and distribution challenges negatively impacted on frequency and patterns of food consumption in households in Africa. Thus, the pandemic poses a greater risk to food security and poverty in the region. Governments could play a significant role in supporting the needs of smallholder farmers, traders and other actors through provision of subsidized agricultural inputs.",

    "abstract": "As elsewhere in Western Europe, large scale intensive agriculture dominates the landscape of the Netherlands. Grassland for dairy production occupies more than a quarter of its land surface. The high production intensity on conventionally farmed grassland leads to poor habitat quality, resulting in sharp declines in bird and insect numbers. Nature-inclusive agriculture (NIA) comprises innovations in farm management, technology and resource use that have the potential to address farmland biodiversity decline, but few Dutch farmers implement these. We aim to analyze the adoption of NIA practices in the Dutch dairy sector. Specifically, we study the influence of the dominant agri-food regime on the innovation system for NIA. Innovation Systems Analysis was performed to identify the various structural barriers which hinder adoption. Our study used a multi-method design in which data on NIA in the Dutch dairy sector was collected via a literature study, four workshops and a focus group discussion. We identified five key blocking mechanisms that hinder adoption of nature-inclusive agriculture in the Dutch dairy sector: (1) insufficient economic incentives for farmers, (2) limited action perspective of many dairy farmers in the Netherlands, (3) lack of a concrete and shared vision for NIA, (4) lack of NIA-specific and integral knowledge and (5) regime resistance, which moreover is connected to each of the previous blocking mechanisms. Our analysis shows that one of the empirical novelties of this paper is that these blocking mechanisms are strongly interlinked in the Dutch dairy sector, thereby perpetuating a situation of lock-in. We conclude that in order to accelerate adoption of nature-inclusive farming practices, problems need to be addressed in conjunction with one another, and therefore holistic approaches are key. A second important conclusion is that in order to foster growth of the innovation system around NIA, the focus should not only be on innovation, but also on transforming current regimes, in particular the currently dominant economic paradigms of growth and yield maximization. By unraveling strongly interlinked blocking mechanisms, this paper provides intervention points to accelerate the transition towards NIA in the Netherlands. These intervention points are not only located within the innovation system, but should preferable be sought for in the broader structures and institutions of the dominant agri-food regime.",

    "abstract": "Resilience is the ability to deal with shocks and stresses, including the unknown and previously unimaginable, such as the Covid-19 crisis.This paper assesses (i) how different farming systems were exposed to the crisis, (ii) which resilience capacities were revealed and (iii) how resilience was enabled or constrained by the farming systems' social and institutional environment.The 11 farming systems included have been analysed since 2017. This allows a comparison of pre-Covid-19 findings and the Covid-19 crisis. Pre-Covid findings are from the SURE-Farm systematic sustainability and resilience assessment. For Covid-19 a special data collection was carried out during the early stage of lockdowns.Our case studies found limited impact of Covid-19 on the production and delivery of food and other agricultural products. This was due to either little exposure or the agile activation of robustness capacities of the farming systems in combination with an enabling institutional environment. Revealed capacities were mainly based on already existing connectedness among farmers and more broadly in value chains. Across cases, the experience of the crisis triggered reflexivity about the operation of the farming systems. Recurring topics were the need for shorter chains, more fairness towards farmers, and less dependence on migrant workers. However, actors in the farming systems and the enabling environment generally focused on the immediate issues and gave little real consideration to long-term implications and challenges. Hence, adaptive or transformative capacities were much less on display than coping capacities. The comparison with pre-Covid findings mostly showed similarities. If challenges, such as shortage of labour, already loomed before, they persisted during the crisis. Furthermore, the eminent role of resilience attributes was confirmed. In cases with high connectedness and diversity we found that these system characteristics contributed significantly to dealing with the crisis. Also the focus on coping capacities was already visible before the crisis. We are not sure yet whether the focus on short-term robustness just reflects the higher visibility and urgency of shocks compared to slow processes that undermine or threaten important system functions, or whether they betray an imbalance in resilience capacities at the expense of adaptability and transformability.Our analysis indicates that if transformations are required, e.g. to respond to concerns about transnational value chains and future pandemics from zoonosis, the transformative capacity of many farming systems needs to be actively enhanced through an enabling environment.",

    "abstract": "Crop residues (CR) have become a limited resource in mixed crop-livestock farms. As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, CR became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers' decisions on CR use are determined by farmers' preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of CR use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of CR use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of CR use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for CR and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of CR use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low–moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of CR use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural productivity and growth in Mali are under threat from erratic rainfall, resulting in more frequent dry years. The national economy is vulnerable to climate change due to 50% of the gross domestic product coming from the agricultural sector and 75% of the population living in rural areas. The Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) concept arises from a need to provide innovative solutions towards the complex and integrated goals of increasing yields, improving resilience, and promoting a low emissions agricultural sector. A major challenge for policymakers to operationalize CSA is the identification, valuation (cost-benefit), and subsequent prioritization of climate-smart options and portfolios (groups of CSA options) for investment. This paper presents the process, results, and lessons learned from a yearlong pilot of the Climate-Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework (CSA-PF) in Mali. Key national and international stakeholders participated in the co-development and prioritization of two CSA portfolios and related action plans for the Malian Sudanese zone. Initial steps towards outcomes of the process include inclusion of prioritized CSA practices in ongoing development projects and prompting discussion of modifications of future calls for agricultural development proposals by regional donors.",

    "abstract": "Planning for agricultural adaptation and mitigation has to lean on informed decision-making processes. Stakeholder involvement, consensus building and the integration of comprehensive and reliable information represent crucial, yet challenging, pillars for successful outcomes. The spatially-explicit multi-criteria decision support framework “targetCSA” presented here aims to aid the targeting of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) at the national level. This framework integrates quantitative, spatially-explicit information such as vulnerability indicators (e.g. soil organic matter, literacy rate and market access) and proxies for CSA practices (e.g. soil fertility improvement, water harvesting and agroforestry) as well as qualitative opinions on these targeting criteria from a broad range of stakeholders. The analytic hierarchy process and a goal optimization approach are utilized to quantify collective, consensus-oriented stakeholder preferences on vulnerability indicators and CSA practices. Spatially-explicit vulnerability and CSA data are aggregated and coupled with stakeholder preferences deriving vulnerability and CSA suitability indices. Based on these indices, relevant regions with the potential to implement CSA practices are identified. “targetCSA” was exemplarily applied in Kenya exploring group-specific and overall consensus-based solutions of stakeholder opinions on vulnerability and CSA under different consensus scenarios. In this example, 32 experts from four stakeholder groups who participated in two surveys were included. The subsequent analyses not only revealed consistently regions with high CSA potential but also highlighted different high potential areas depending on the applied consensus scenario. Thus, this framework allows stakeholders to explore the consequences of scenarios that reflect opinions of the majority and minority or are based on a balance between them. “targetCSA” and the application example contribute valuable insights to the development of policy and planning tools to consensually target and implement CSA.",

    "abstract": "Public and private research institutions are grappling with the challenges and opportunities of embedding dimensions of responsible innovation within their research and development programs, including those seeking to transform agricultural productivity and sustainability through digital technologies. Central to meeting this challenge is building institutional, organisational and professional capacity for anticipation and reflexiveness within multidisciplinary research communities. Foresighting methodologies provide a means by which this might be usefully and practically enabled, whilst also shedding light on the broader social and ethical implications of alternative agricultural technology development pathways under uncertain environmental and industry futures. This paper presents the results of a participatory foresighting exercise undertaken as part of a large, publicly funded multi-disciplinary research initiative designed to build a common big data infrastructure to harness the benefits of the digital revolution for the Australian agricultural and land sectors. We seek to explore what role digital technology will play in the future of Australian agriculture and to consider the social and ethical implications. We ran a one-day foresighting workshop comprised of four steps – 1) horizon scanning to identify trends 2) selecting two drivers of change 3) producing a matrix to generate scenarios 4) building and refining scenarios. Participants explored different possible futures of farming in Australia, with a focus on scenarios involving socio-technical dimensions of digital agriculture to consider the implications of these futures for research practice and for farming communities. Four scenarios were developed, distinguished by the interplay of two critical but uncertain drivers of change identified by participants, namely: the degree of resource security or insecurity that future agricultural enterprises are likely to experience; and the degree to which farming sectors maintain traditional farm business models and associated value chains or transition to more diverse or innovative business models. The process highlighted the need to increase the capacity and opportunity for more reflexivity in research and development, if positive outcomes were to be achieved. The scenarios we produced provide a catalyst for conversation about the implications of digital technology development in Australia and globally, for industry, policy and research and development. In particular, the scenarios highlight potential changes in farm business models, decision making, and beneficiaries and inequities of new technologies and other components of food value chains. The paper also serves as a guide and prompt for others, by demonstrating one way reflexivity can be achieved in organisations attempting innovation.",

    "abstract": "Smallholder farmers in Malawi must cope with small farm size, low soil fertility and production risks associated with rainfed agriculture. Integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems is advocated as a means to increase production of diverse nutrient-dense grains and improve soil fertility. It is difficult to achieve both aims simultaneously, however. Short-duration grain legumes rarely produce enough biomass to appreciatively improve soils, and long duration pigeonpea, commonly grown in Malawi as a dual purpose crop, produces little or no edible grain as a consequence of grain-filling into the dry season. A novel technology is the doubled-up legume rotation (DLR) system in which two legumes with complementary phenology are intercropped and grown in rotation with maize. Initial performance from on-farm research is favorable; however, it is crucial to understand competition for resources in mixed cropping systems under variable soil and climate conditions. We used soil and crop yield data from farmer participatory trials to parameterize the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and evaluate its performance in simulating observed treatments at three locations in central Malawi. We used the calibrated APSIM model to investigate the performance of DLR and other maize-based systems across 26 growing seasons (1979–2005) in the three agroecologies. We simulated two DLR systems (maize rotated with a groundnut/pigeonpea or soybean/pigeonpea intercrop), maize rotated with groundnut or soybean, maize intercropped with pigeonpea, and continuous maize under a range of N fertilizer inputs. We extended findings to the household level by determining calorie and protein yields of these systems, and calculating the chance that an average household could meet their food requirements by dedicating all available farmland to a given system. Simulated maize grain yields in DLR and maize-grain legume rotations were essentially equivalent, and exceeded yields in maize/pigeonpea intercrop and sole cropped maize receiving comparable fertility inputs. All rotation systems were more likely to meet household calorie and protein needs than other systems receiving equivalent inputs. DLR systems accumulated higher total soil C and N over time than traditional rotation systems in areas where pigeonpea performed well. However, the effects of improved soil fertility on maize yields were counterbalanced by factors including N immobilization and water availability. We conclude that where growing conditions allow, DLR can harness the complementary phenology of pigeonpea to build soil quality for the future without reducing maize yields or compromising household food production in the immediate term.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this contribution is to report the initial impacts of measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic on Myanmar's agri-food system. Myanmar is one of several late-transforming low-income countries in Southeast Asia where agriculture still plays a large role in rural livelihoods, and where food prices are a key factor affecting nutrition security for poor urban and rural households. Whereas the economic impacts of COVID-19 disruptions on tourism and manufacturing were obvious to policymakers, the impacts on the agri-food system were less evident and often more indirect. This resulted in the rural sector being allocated only a very small share of the government's initial fiscal response to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19. To correct this information gap, a suite of phone surveys covering a wide spectrum of actors in the agri-food system were deployed, including farm input suppliers, mechanization service providers, farmers, commodity traders, millers, food retailers and consumers. The surveys were repeated at regular intervals prior to and during the main crop production season which began shortly after nationwide COVID-19 prevention measures were implemented in April. While the results indicate considerable resilience in the agri-food system in response to the initial disruptions, persistent financial stress for a high proportion of households and agri-food system businesses indicate that the road to a full recovery will take time. The experience provides important lessons for strengthening the resilience of the agri-food system, and the livelihoods of households that depend on it.",

Dataset of phenological observations complemented with regional cropping calendars across Europe is used. The calibration of thermal requirements for anthesis and maturity is done by pooling all available observations within European agro-environmental zones and minimizing an objective function that combines the differences between observed and simulated anthesis, maturity and harvest dates. Calibrated phenology results in substantial improvement in simulated dates of anthesis with respect to the original MCYFS simulations. The combined improvements to the system result in a physically more plausible spatial distribution of crop model indicators across Europe. Crop yield indicators point to better agreement with recorded national winter wheat yields with respect to the original MCYFS simulations, most pronounced in central, eastern and southern Europe. However, model skill remains low in large parts of western Europe, which may possibly be attributed to the impacts of wet conditions.",

    "abstract": "Tropical agroforestry systems provide a number of ecosystem services that might help sustain the production of multiple crops, improve farmers' livelihoods and conserve biodiversity. A major drawback of agroforestry coffee systems is the perceived lower economic performance compared to high-input monoculture coffee systems, which is driving worldwide intensification practices of coffee systems. However, comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of small-scale coffee plantations are scarce. Consequently, there is a need to improve our understanding of the economic performance of coffee systems under different shade and input management practices. We provide a comprehensive economic analysis of Arabica coffee farming practices where we compare productivity, costs, net income and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 162 small-scale, Peruvian coffee plantations under different shade and input management practices along an elevation gradient. By using a cluster analysis, three shade and three input classes (low, medium and high) were defined. We found similar economic performance for all shade classes, but reduced net income and BCR in the High-Input class. More specifically, there was no difference in net income or BCR between low, medium and high shade classes. The High-Input class had significantly lower net income and BCR, mainly due to increased costs of (hired) labour, land, and fertilizer and fungicides; costs which were not fully compensated for by higher coffee yields. Coffee yield decreased with elevation, whereas gate coffee price and quality, as well as shade levels, increased with elevation. Additional revenues from timber could increase farmers' income and overall economic performance of shaded plantations in the future. Our analysis provides evidence that for small-scale coffee production, agroforestry systems perform equally well or better than unshaded plantations with high input levels, reinforcing the theory that good economic performance can coincide with conservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Additional comprehensive and transparent economic analyses for other geographic regions are needed to be able to draw generalizable conclusions for smallholder coffee farming worldwide. We advise that future economic performance studies simultaneously address the effects of shade and input management on economic performance indicators and take biophysical variation into account.",

    "abstract": "Palm oil has become a leading vegetable oil over the past 30 years and smallholder farmers in Indonesia, with more than 12 million hectare the world’s largest producer of palm oil, have massively engaged in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation. In Sumatra, where more than 60% of Indonesian palm oil is cultivated, smallholders currently cover roughly 50% of the oil palm area. The rapid expansion of palm oil however did not happen without controversy. In current efforts by the Indonesian government, NGO's and private sector to improve sector performance, smallholders are often characterized as the Achilles heel of the oil palm sector due to poor practices and low yields compared to companies. However, ‘oil palm smallholders’ is a container concept and there has been only limited research into smallholder diversity beyond the organised versus independent farmer dichotomy. This research delves into the implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) among seven types of independent smallholders in Rokan Hulu regency, Riau province. The research area consisted of a relative established agricultural area on mineral soils and a relative frontier, mostly on peat. Smallholder types ranged from small local farmers to large farmers who usually reside in urban areas far from their plantation and regard oil palm cultivation as an investment opportunity. The underlying hypothesis is that larger farmers have more capital and therefore implement better agricultural practices than small farmers, who are usually more cash constrained. A wide range of methods was applied, including farmer and farm surveys, remote sensing, tissue analysis and photo interpretation by experts. These methods provided data on fertilizer use, nutrient conditions in oil palms, planting material, planting patterns, and other management practices in the plantations. Results show that yields are poor, implementation of GAP are limited and there is much room for improvement among all farmer types. Poor planting materials, square planting patterns, and limited nutrient applications were particularly prevalent. This implies that farmers across different typologies opt for a low-input low-output system for a myriad of reasons and that under current conditions, initiatives such as improving access to finance or availability of good planting material alone are unlikely to significantly improve the productivity and sustainability of the smallholder oil palm sector.",

    "abstract": "Over the course of just a few years, shrimp farming has become a major aquaculture production system in coastal areas of several developing countries across the globe. However, farmers are facing a variety of risks related to disease, market, and climate, which influence risk management strategies and adoption of new technologies. This paper looks at three practices related to pond management: (1) water quality management to ensure a good environment for shrimp growth; (2) adequate feed input; and (3) disease control practices in order to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak in the pond. We investigated adoption of these three practices in smallholder shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, by exploring how and whether membership into a producer's cluster influences access to knowledge and perception of risk in the adoption process. The results show that, after controlling for farm characteristics, farm clustering has a positive relationship with the adoption of water quality management, feed inputs, and disease control practices. Results also indicate that increasing interaction frequency with public sector and private sector's actors, as well as the perceived degree of market risk, positively influences the adoption of the three pond management practices under study. Mediation analyses show that being a member of a farmer cluster influences adoption of farming practices via two underlying processes: frequency of interaction with public and private sector's actors, and perception of market risk, both of which ultimately promote the adoption of practices. We conclude that clustering is a promising avenue for fostering interactions between farmers and key supporting actors in aquaculture, and impacts both the formation of specific aqua-related risk perceptions and subsequent practice adoption. As such, clusters – by fostering linkages and facilitating interactions between different knowledge sources – can promote adoption of practices toward sustainable intensification. However, to more effectively deploy a cluster approach a key policy and practice implication is to take into consideration local idiosyncrasies defined by their social interactions, risk perception and spatial dimensions in order to better facilitate local linkages between farms (horizontal coordination) and a better integration with the value chain (vertical coordination).",

    "abstract": "Sustainable intensification (SI) has been regarded as the basis for environmentally sound and equitable agricultural development. Field based assessment of technologies needs to move beyond production and economic performance to include environment, social and human condition. In this study we systematically consider all five domains of SI based on participatory action research (PAR) initiated in 2012 at three Central Malawi sites that varied in agroecology from low to high potential. Fifteen SI indicators were assessed for four technologies: sole maize (Zea mays L.) with 0 and recommended fertilization (69 kg N ha− 1 and 9 kg P ha− 1), pigeonpea (Cajanus Cajun (L.) Millsp.)-maize intercrop (half rate fertilizer), and doubled up legume rotation (DLR, a pigeonpea-groundnut intercrop) sequenced with maize at half rate fertilizer in that phase. Through radar charts SI performance and tradeoffs were visualized, and causal loop analysis allowed identification of research gaps. SI indicator assessments included crop performance from on-farm trials, profitability, modeled probability of food sufficiency, risk of crop failure and ratings of technologies by women farmers who were engaged in evaluation of technologies through participatory research. The PAR included six mother trials, 236 baby trial farmers and a survey that was carried out with 324 farmers (baby trial farmers plus control farmers) to document socio-economic factors and management practices on focal fields. Replicated mother trials further provided the basis for simulation modeling (APSIM) of weather-associated crop failure risk and slow processes such as soil carbon (C) accrual. Radar charts were used to visualize SI performance of the technologies. Environmental performance of the two pigeonpea-diversified technologies was variable, but generally high compared with sole maize systems, due to gains in vegetative biomass, duration of cover and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Maize production and economic assessment varied by site, and with steeper tradeoffs for legume diversification in the mesic site, less so in the marginal site. The domains of social and human capacity building were superior for legume integration, notably in terms of diverse diet, food security and farmer preferences (notably, female farmers generally favored legume crops). Performance varied by site with legume systems most beneficial at the most marginal site, including less risk of crop failure than unfertilized maize. Causal loop analyses identified regulators of SI that require further attention, notably: crop-livestock conflicts and opportunities, male-female control of legume crop production, and residue management. Overall, the SI indicators framework provided a systematic means to consider tradeoffs and opportunities associated with novel crop combinations and management practices.",

    "abstract": "Grassland based farming systems are exposed to extreme weather events causing volatile farm incomes. Grazing and lacking yield measurements make it largely impossible to insure grassland production with traditional insurance products. In contrast, index insurance products have the potential to insure grasslands, as their payoff relies on an endogenous index that is highly correlated to, but independent of, the actual grass yield. To support future development of these products, we provide the first systematic overview of 12 index insurances put into practise for grasslands in Europe and North America. Additionally, based on this overview, we present prevailing findings that are important for further research and insurance practitioners. We find that a large diversity of index insurance types is applied in practise, including insurance solutions based on regional yield levels, weather variables or satellite imagery. We reveal separated insurance markets (i.e. country-specific products), which prevent knowledge spillovers and lead to largely isolated product developments. Thus, grassland insurance schemes can be improved by knowledge exchange and combining methods that are applied elsewhere. More specifically, insurances tailored to single farm's risk exposure, the combination of satellite with other geodata (e.g. land use information) or adapting legal specifications that disadvantage some types of insurances can improve an insurance's risk reducing capacity and make grassland based farming systems more resilient to weather extremes. This paper provides an entry point for such process, ensuring the development of efficient measures for farmers to cope with climatic risks.",

We reviewed the literature on agricultural systems analyses of food security at the household- and regional-levels, finding that the primary focus is on only one dimension of food security—agricultural output as a proxy for food availability. Given that food security comprises availability, access, utilization and stability dimensions, improved practice would involve more effort to incorporate food access and stability indicators into agricultural systems models. The empirical evidence base for including food access indicators and their determinants within agricultural systems models requires further development through appropriate short and long-term investments in data collection and analysis. Assessment of the stability dimension of food security (through time) is also particularly under-represented in previous work and requires the development and application of appropriate dynamic models of agricultural systems that include food security indicators, coupled with more formalized treatment of robustness and adaptability at both the regional and household levels. We find that agricultural systems models often conflate analysis of food security covariates that have the potential to improve food security (like agricultural yields) with an assessment of food security itself. Agricultural systems modelers should exercise greater caution in referring to analyses of agricultural output and food availability as representing food security more generally.",

In this article, we analyze the relation of crop insurance and pesticide use in European agriculture using the examples of France and Switzerland. In our conceptual and empirical framework, we account for the complex structure of insurance uptake, land use and pesticide use decisions of farmers, potentially leading to insurance - pesticide use interactions both at the intensive and extensive margin. Our empirical results indicate a positive and economically significant relation between crop insurance and pesticide use in European agriculture. The findings suggest that without crop insurance, pesticide expenditures would be 6 to 11% lower. However, the importance of extensive and intensive margin relations differs between France and Switzerland and is related to country specific characteristics. We conclude that new risk management instruments should account for potential effects on input use.",

    "abstract": "This introduction to the special issue deploys a framework, inspired by realist synthesis and introduced in Section 1, that aims to untangle the contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes associated with investments that link poverty reduction and rural prosperity within a broad agri-food systems perspective. Section 2 considers changes in contexts: Where are agricultural research investments most likely to be an engine of poverty reduction? Over the past 25 years, there have been profound changes in the development context of most countries, necessitating an update on strategic insights for research investment priorities relevant for the economic, political, social, environmental, and structural realities of the early 21st Century. Section 2 briefly surveys changes in these structural aspects of poverty and development processes in low-income countries, with particular attention to new drivers (e.g., urbanization, climate change) that will be of increasing salience in the coming decades. In Section 3, we turn to mechanisms: What are the plausible impact pathways and what evidence exists to test their plausibility? Poor farmers in the developing world are often the stated focus of public sector agricultural research. However, farmers are not the only potential beneficiaries of agricultural research; rural landless laborers, stakeholders along food value chains, and the urban poor can also be major beneficiaries of such research. Thus, there are multiple, interacting pathways through which agricultural research can contribute to reductions in poverty and associated livelihood vulnerabilities. This paper introduces an ex ante set of 18 plausible impact pathways from agricultural research to rural prosperity outcomes, employing bibliometric methods to assess the evidence underpinning causal links. In Section 4, we revisit the concept of desired impacts: When we seek poverty reduction, what does that mean and what measures are needed to demonstrate impact? The papers in this special issue are intended to yield insights to inform improvements in agricultural research that seeks to reduce poverty. History indicates that equity of distribution of gains matters hugely, and thus the questions of \"who wins?\" and \"who loses?\" must be addressed. Moreover, our understanding(s) of \"poverty\" and the intended outcomes of development investments have become much richer over the past 25 years, incorporating more nuance regarding gender, community differences, and fundamental reconsideration of the meaning of poverty and prosperity that are not captured by simple head count income or even living standard measures.",

    "abstract": "The global land system is facing unprecedented pressures from growing human populations and climatic change. Understanding the effects these pressures may have is necessary to designing land management strategies that ensure food security, ecosystem service provision and successful climate mitigation and adaptation. However, the number of complex, interacting effects involved makes any complete understanding very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the recent development of integrated modelling frameworks allows for the exploration of the co-development of human and natural systems under scenarios of global change, potentially illuminating the main drivers and processes in future land system change. Here, we use one such integrated modelling framework (the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform) to investigate the range of projected outcomes in the European land system across climatic and socio-economic scenarios for the 2050s. We find substantial consistency in locations and types of change even under the most divergent conditions, with results suggesting that climate change alone will lead to a contraction in the agricultural and forest area within Europe, particularly in southern Europe. This is partly offset by the introduction of socioeconomic changes that change both the demand for agricultural production, through changing food demand and net imports, and the efficiency of agricultural production. Simulated extensification and abandonment in the Mediterranean region is driven by future decreases in the relative profitability of the agricultural sector in southern Europe, owing to decreased productivity as a consequence of increased heat and drought stress and reduced irrigation water availability. The very low likelihood (< 33% probability) that current land use proportions in many parts of Europe will remain unchanged suggests that future policy should seek to promote and support the multifunctional role of agriculture and forests in different European regions, rather than focusing on increased productivity as a route to agricultural and forestry viability.",

This paper presents a framework for the use of farm-level and landscape-scale models and data to provide analysis that could be used in NextGen knowledge products, such as mobile applications or personal computer data analysis and visualization software. We describe two analytical tools - AgBiz Logic and TOA-MD - that demonstrate the current capability of farmlevel and landscape-scale models.

    "abstract": "Nairobi is a large rapidly-growing city whose demand for beef, mutton and goat products is expected to double by 2030. The study aimed to map the Nairobi beef, sheep and goat systems structure and flows to identify deficiencies and vulnerabilities to shocks. Cross-sectional data were collected through focus group discussions and interviews with people operating in Nairobi ruminant livestock and meat markets and in the large processing companies. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained about the type of people, animals, products and value adding activities in the chains, and their structural, spatial and temporal interactions. Mapping analysis was done in three different dimensions: people and product profiling (interactions of people and products), geographical (routes of animals and products) and temporal mapping (seasonal fluctuations). The results obtained were used to identify structural deficiencies and vulnerability factors in the system. Results for the beef food system showed that 44-55% of the city's beef supply flows through the 'local terminal markets', but that 54-64% of total supply is controlled by one 'meat market'. Numerous informal chains were identified, with independent livestock and meat traders playing a pivotal role in the functionality of these systems, and where most activities are conducted with inefficient quality control and under scarce and inadequate infrastructure and organisation, generating wastage and potential food safety risks in low quality meat products. Geographical and temporal analysis showed the critical areas influencing the different markets, with larger markets increasing their market share in the low season. Large processing companies, partly integrated, operate with high quality infrastructures, but with up to 60% of their beef supply depending on similar routes as the informal markets. Only these companies were involved in value addition activities, reaching high-end markets, but also dominating the distribution of popular products, such as beef sausages, to middle and low-end market. For the small ruminant food system, 73% of the low season supply flows through a single large informal market, Kiamaiko, located in an urban informal settlement. No grading is done for these animals or the meat produced. Large companies were reported to export up to 90% of their products. Lack of traceability and control of animal production was a common feature in all chains. The mapping presented provides a framework for policy makers and institutions to understand and design improvement plans for the Nairobi ruminant food system. The structural deficiencies and vulnerabilities identified here indicate the areas of intervention needed.",

    "abstract": "This Editorial to the Special Issue \"Science of Scaling: connecting the pathways of agricultural research and development for improved food, income and nutrition security\" presents the framing, overview and analysis of 10 articles focussed on scaling innovation in the agricultural research for development sector. The publications cut across three categories that focus on: (i) Understanding the scaling trajectory retrospectively from a longer term, systems perspective, (ii) Understanding scaling of innovation retrospectively as part of shorter term agricultural research for development interventions, and (iii) Conceptual or methodological approaches aimed at guiding scaling prospectively. Cross-cutting review of the publications leads to several insights and critically questions dominant ways of understanding and guiding scaling of innovation in the agricultural research for development sector. This provides a starting point for proposing more outcome-oriented scaling as a third wave of understanding and guiding scaling, beyond technology adoption (first wave) and the scaling of innovation (second wave). The Editorial proposes three Research Domains for the Science of Scaling: (1) 'Understand the big picture of scaling innovation' that can inform more realistic ideas about the factors, conditions and dynamics that affect innovation and scaling processes; (2) 'Develop instruments that nurture efficient and responsible scaling' that comprises new approaches, concepts and tools that can facilitate the development of evidence-based scaling strategies; and (3) 'Create a conducive environment for scaling innovation' that focusses on the institutional arrangements, partnership models, and monitoring and learning for scaling of innovation.",

    "abstract": "To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, India imposed a national lockdown at the end of March 2020, a decision that resulted in a massive reverse migration as many workers across economic sectors returned to their home regions. Migrants provide the foundations of the agricultural workforce in the 'breadbasket' states of Punjab and Haryana in Northwest India.There are mounting concerns that near and potentially longer-term reductions in labor availability may jeopardize agricultural production and consequently national food security. The timing of rice transplanting at the beginning of the summer monsoon season has a cascading influence on productivity of the entire rice-wheat cropping system. To assess the potential for COVID-related reductions in the agriculture workforce to disrupt production of the dominant rice-wheat cropping pattern in these states, we use a spatial ex ante modelling framework to evaluate four scenarios representing a range of plausible labor constraints on the timing of rice transplanting. Averaged over both states, results suggest that rice productivity losses under all delay scenarios would be low as compare to those for wheat, with total system productivity loss estimates ranging from 9%, to 21%, equivalent to economic losses of USD $674 m to $1.48 billion. Late rice transplanting and harvesting can also aggravate winter air pollution with concomitant health risks. Technological options such as direct seeded rice, staggered nursery transplanting, and crop diversification away from rice can help address these challenges but require new approaches to policy and incentives for change.",

    "abstract": "CVOID-19 induced significant economic and social disruptions in India. Rural households, including smallholders, were affected by loss in migrant income, livelihood and farm and non-farm incomes. During this lockdown, the Indian government enacted several emergency legislations to provide direct and indirect relief to workers and households. India's COVID-19 social assistance package, namely, PM-GKY, announced in March 2020, was designed to provide immediate relief to the vulnerable population. The PM-GKY provided cash direct benefit transfers (DBT) and in-kind supports (IKS) through existing schemes.This study examines the impact of India's government assistance package (known as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana or PM-GKY), announced immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown, on the procurement of agricultural inputs for the upcoming farming season.The study uses a quasi-experimental method and survey data from 1,789 smallholder households in three northern Indian states (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh).The result suggests that the fungibility of funds received under the government transfer package was significant in alleviating credit constraints and increasing agricultural investments in agricultural inputs. The farmers who received benefits from the PM-GKY scheme spent significantly more on the procurement of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.The disbursement of cash transfers in the three states showed that emergency relief packages had reached the vulnerable sections of Indian society. Overall, 89-94% of households benefited from direct cash transfers. Perhaps lower transaction costs, minimal leakages, and immediate delivery make a strong case for direct cash transfers. The above advantages facilitate the provision of relief to a large proportion of vulnerable sections of Indian society in a short period.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the most pressing challenges for humanity. The pandemic is affecting all aspects of human lives and livelihoods, including food. In this context, new research shows the nexus between agri-food systems and the spread of emergent infectious diseases (EID) such as the coronavirus disease while at the same time, shows how the COVID-19 pandemics has heavily impacted food systems. The aim of this work is to shed light and draw, through the case of COVID-19, the network of direct and indirect links and feedback loops between the globalised food system and pandemics. We conducted a literature review. As with climate change, food systems have a double relation with EID in general, and in particular with the present world health crisis linked to COVID-19. On the one hand, global agri-food systems, as currently organised, are a necessary step in the development of EID, through their impacts in land use changes, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss and climate change. On the other hand, COVID-19 has had and is having impacts on all food systems at all scales. The review shows that all activities of the food system (from production to consumption) as well as all pillars of food security (availability, access, use, stability) have been affected. The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on food systems can be divided between direct impacts of the virus outbreak, and indirect impacts derived from the containment measures (e.g. lockdowns, mobility restrictions, shops closure) adopted at different levels (from local to global). While all food systems across the globe have been affected by the pandemic, it is argued that vulnerability is different for different types of food systems. Long food supply chains have been particularly affected by COVID-19 crisis, however, it is important to avoid universalization of impacts and responses as agri-food systems are characterised by a huge diversity and heterogeneity. The review concludes by pointing out that while the pandemic represents a challenge for the global food systems, this 'stress test' can be also seized as an opportunity to highlight vulnerabilities to be urgently addressed during the recovery period and speed up the transformation towards more sustainable and resilient food systems. A food systems approach is essential to have a broader picture of the relationship of agri-food systems with zoonosis and their centrality in the pandemics and the derived socio-economic consequences.",

    "abstract": "• Bare soil management reduced dissimilarity of plant traits and species richness. • Vegetation cover and biodiversity benefit from low disturbance frequencies. • Vegetation management needs to deal with trade-offs: Species-poor grass cover crops reduce species richness and functional divergence. • However, cover crops increased vegetation cover thereby reducing soil erosion risk. • Landscape diversity had only a slight positive impact on plant species richness. Land-use intensification at the field and landscape scale is a strong driver for declining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Vineyards are characterised by non-productive inter-rows, which could potentially host diverse plant communities. Mulching, tillage or herbicides are used to mitigate the competition between vines and the inter-row vegetation. As plant species with the same set of functional traits will respond similarly to environmental filters like management measures, knowledge about plant trait–environment-relations can be used to predict community and ecosystem processes which are essential for preserving ecosystem services like soil erosion mitigation. We hypothesized that higher vegetation management intensity reduces plant (functional) diversity, changes functional traits and community composition. Across Europe, four viticultural regions in Austria, France, Spain and Romania, which comprised 78 vineyards differing in vegetation management intensity (bare soil, temporary and permanent vegetation cover), were selected for sampling vascular plant diversity. Around each vineyard, the surrounding landscape composition and landscape diversity was investigated within a 750 m radius. Rao's quadratic entropy as a measure of functional diversity was calculated based on a selection of plant functional traits. The effects of management and landscape variables on species richness, functional traits, functional diversity and vegetation cover were analysed by generalized linear mixed models and random forests (RF). Furthermore, plant community composition was analysed with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Higher management intensities resulted in lower species richness, functional diversity and vegetation cover. The country with the related divergent edaphoclimatic conditions was a significant factor affecting most diversity and functional trait parameters, whereas landscape diversity increased plant species richness only slightly. Vegetation management intensity had the highest explanatory power for species richness, functional diversity and most functional traits according to RF analysis. Consequently, plant functional traits like a higher coverage of ruderals and annuals could be clearly related to bare soil management. Furthermore, the type of cover crops influenced the relationship between annual and perennial plant species, Grime plant strategy types and species diversity. Accordingly, NMDS showed a separation between permanent vegetation cover and bare soil vineyards. The overall positive effect of extensive management and the use of diverse cover crops or spontaneous vegetation in vineyard inter-rows should be better implemented in agricultural policies to support both, biodiversity and ecosystem provision.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors and human activities around the World. In this article we present a first attempt to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 and the sanitary measures taken by governments on farming systems in Central America and Mexico (CAM). Through a review of information generated in these initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (webinars, blogs, electronic publications, media) and 44 interviews with key informants across the region, we have identified the main impacts felt by different types of farming systems in the region. From corporate agricultural production systems, to small and medium scale entrepreneurs and smallholder subsistence farm households, all types of farming systems were impacted, more or less severely, by the different measures implemented by governments such as reduced mobility, closure of public and private venues and restrictions in borders. Larger corporate farming systems with vertical market integration and high level of control or coordination within the supply chain, and smallholder or subsistence farming systems with important focus on production for self-consumption and little external input use, were both relatively less impacted and showed greater adaptive capacity than the medium and small entrepreneurial farming systems dependent on agriculture as their primary income and with less control over the upstream and downstream parts of their supply chain. All types of farming systems implemented a series of mechanisms to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic including the development of alternative value chains, food and agricultural products delivery systems and the exponential use of digital means to communicate and maintain the viability of the different agricultural systems. Collective action and organization of farmers also proved to be an important coping mechanism that allowed some farmers to acquire inputs and deliver outputs in the context of restricted mobility, price volatility, and general uncertainty. Some features of the CAM region played an important role in mediating the impact of COVID-19 and associated sanitary measures. We identify as particularly relevant the nature of agricultural exports, the current structure of the agricultural sector, the diversified livelihood strategies of rural households, and the importance of mobility for rural livelihoods. The results presented focus only in the immediate effect of COVID-19 pandemic and the mechanisms implemented by farmers in the first months. Whether these impacts and response mechanisms will result in a transformation of the farming systems towards greater resilience and sustainability is still an open question.",

    "abstract": "The development and scaling of orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) during the past 25 years is a case study of a disruptive innovation to address a pressing need - the high levels of vitamin A deficiency among children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. When the innovation was introduced consumers strongly preferred white or yellow-fleshed sweetpotato, so it was necessary to create a demand to respond to that need. This was at odds with the breeding strategy of responding to consumers' demands. Additional elements of the innovation package include seed systems and nutrition education to create the awareness amongst consumers of the significant health benefits of OFSP. Complementary innovation is required in promotion and advocacy to ensure a supportive institutional environment. Four dimensions-- technical, organizational, leadership, and institutional environment-- are explored across five distinct phases of the innovation process, from the emergence of the innovative idea (1991-1996) through scaling phase in 15 countries under a major institutional innovation (2015-mid-2019), the Sweetpotato for Profit and Health Initiative (SPHI). Systematically gathering evidence of nutritional impact and ability to scale cost-effectively was requisite for obtaining support for further development and diffusion of the crop. Positive findings from a major study coincided with a major change in the institutional environment which placed agriculture and nutrition at the forefront of the development agenda, resulting in an inflection point in both research and diffusion investment. The role of committed leadership during all phases was critical for success, but particularly during the first decade of limited support in a challenging institutional environment. The most critical technical achievement underpinning scaling was moving from 2 to 13 African countries having local breeding programs. Evidence is presented that adapted, well performing varieties which consumers prefer is the foundation for successful scaling to occur. Building a cadre of within country and regional advocates was critical for getting sustained commitment and local buy-in to the concept of biofortification by regional bodies and governments, which in turn built within country ownership and the willingness of donors to invest. The SPHI united diverse organizations under a common vision with a simple metric--- the number of households reached with improved varieties of sweetpotato. Since 2009, 6.2 million households were reached by July 2019 in 15 SSA countries. Much more remains to be done. Advocacy efforts led to the integration of nutritious foods into many national and regional policies, setting the stage for further investment.",

    "abstract": "The potential of marginal lands to improve food security, support bioenergy production or ecosystem services has globally got a lot of attention. Defining agricultural marginal land is a task that involves more than just considering the land's quality, its definition changed a lot during the last two centuries. Development of new technologies and policy trends require the concepts of prime land and marginal land to be renewed from time to time. Although much research has been done on the concept of marginal land, it is currently limited by the lack of a clear, globally accepted definition. There are four major sources of criteria of marginal lands: economic (e.g., rent cost, land value), geographical (e.g., temperature, slope, precipitation), ecosystem-based (e.g., protected areas, recreation, ecosystem services), soil suitability (e.g., yield capability, physical and chemical soil properties). The categorisation of agricultural land into groups like productive, marginal or unproductive often depends on the cultivation or management type. Since conceptions of marginal land are dynamic both in time and space, flexible policy and practical solutions are needed for their non-degrading use, which in any case shall support nature-based socioeconomic development. To maintain the socioeconomic value of these areas, it is crucial to develop rural areas that are economically or biophysically marginalised. High nature value farming, bioenergy crops by sustainable land management and afforestation are highly recommended. Choosing the right management can transform marginal land into an optimal soil condition or incorrect management can degrade prime land into marginal land (unproductive land). This paper provides a review and categorisation of the historical and new developments of marginal land concepts especially those which are working with agricultural aspects, including land management and reclamation. It could give a strong basis for further research in topic of marginal land.",

    "abstract": "Windbreaks are an agroforestry practice used to provide simultaneous economic, environmental and social benefits that occur when trees are deliberately integrated into an agroecosystem. To date, no systematic review has been conducted on windbreak adoption in the U.S., which is needed to assess whether broader trends exist that may affect future research, extension delivery and policy development. This synthesis covers windbreak adoption studies in the U.S. from the earliest identified study in 1949 through 2020. A key finding from this synthesis is that producers use windbreaks on agricultural lands mostly for indirect economic benefits (soil erosion control, livestock protection, wind protection and snow control). This is followed by direct agricultural benefits (increased crop and livestock production) and intrinsic values (aesthetics and wildlife habitat). Direct economic benefits from forestry (timber and non-timber forest products) were often ranked last, despite most producers utilizing their windbreak trees for some economic gain. Windbreak satisfaction was also found to be high among U.S. producers (72–99%), with the beneficial functions varying by windbreak type (field, livestock, and farmstead). The main drivers causing producers to remove windbreaks were poor condition, age, and conflict with farming practices, while the primary reasons for non-adoption of windbreaks were lack of land and windbreak upkeep. Key information gaps needing further investigation include a greater understanding of producer-reported challenges and management activities associated with windbreak planting and maintenance, identifying and monetizing windbreak systems capable of producing marketable products, and valuation of ecosystem services provided by windbreaks over space and time and the potential for developing those markets.",

    "abstract": "Digital technologies nowadays play a major role in innovation within the agri-food domain. The evolution of IT systems has currently arrived at a level that involves complex systems integration and business ecosystems in which many stakeholders in different roles are involved. A new paradigm for digital innovation is needed that copes with this increased complexity. This paper presents an empirically informed framework for analysing and designing viable, sustainable digital innovation ecosystems in the agri-food domain. The research is based on a series of European large-scale public-private innovation projects from 2011 to 2021 with a total budget of 73 M€. They involved hundreds of stakeholders that were developing a large number of digital solutions through which a digital innovation ecosystem for agri-food was formed. In a longitudinal study, a conceptual framework was used to analyse these projects and describe how the digital innovation ecosystem has developed. Lessons learnt are translated into a number of design principles and an organizational approach to foster digital innovation ecosystems in agri-food. The conceptual framework consists of 6 key concepts: (i) innovation strategy, (ii) innovation organization, (iii) innovation network that contains (iv) the innovation process and (v) the innovation object and finally (vi) an innovation infrastructure. Along these 6 concepts, lessons learnt and in total 21 design principles are derived from analysing the projects forming a basis for the organizational framework. At the core of this framework is a lean multi-actor approach to trials and use case development interacting with a set of multidisciplinary activities: (i) developing a common technical collaboration infrastructure, (ii) identifying value streams with user engagement, (iii) engaging the right partners and stakeholders at the right time supported by strategic project planning and dynamic management. The most important conclusion is that effective, successful and quick use of appropriate IT in agri-food requires that actors should not be analysed in isolation from both their technological and business environment. Another consequence is that a 'minimal viable ecosystem' only emerges after considerable time, resources and ingenuity is invested and may require outside (government) intervention. Results from this paper can be used both by public and private stakeholders to diagnose and improve digital innovation projects and develop viable, sustainable digital innovation ecosystems in agri-food.",

The impact of such an event on agricultural systems is unpredictable and can be far reaching. Thus, rather than focusing our research efforts only on increasing the productivity and efficiency of agricultural systems, we may also need to pay attention to what enables them to change and adapt. One approach is to give more attention to relations and processes in a system. This applies to relations within agricultural systems, and between the system and its context; but also to relations between scientific disciplines and between researchers and practitioners. Assessing the fixities and dynamics these relations promote, may enable us to contribute making agricultural systems better able to navigate change processes, may be even enable them to take advantage of openings created by unexpected events.",

    "abstract": "Digitalisation affects the agri-food sector and its governance. However, what digitalisation of the sector will imply for future agricultural policymaking remains unclear. The objective of the study is to develop and evaluate explorative scenarios of digitalisation in the agri-food sector of Europe that are explicitly relevant to agricultural policy. The study aims to provide guidance for strategic development of agricultural policy to address the potentials, uncertainties and unknowns arising with digitalisation of the sector. We combine a Delphi study and a participatory scenario workshop to develop and evaluate plausible explorative scenarios of digitalisation of Europe's agri-food sector. For all scenarios we identify gaps in achieving a range of important European agricultural policy goals, drawing on the Delphi study and desk-based analysis. Subsequently we deduce strategies to address these agricultural policy gaps. Four scenarios of digitalisation of the agri-food sector were developed for Europe in 2030. They comprise of 1) digitalisation of the sector following current directions at current rates as a baseline scenario, 2) strong digitalisation of a regulatory government, 3) use of autonomous farming technology and 4) digitalised food business. These explorative scenarios entail various gaps in achieving European agricultural policy goals. Our findings suggest that the baseline scenario needs strategies to ramp up technological and institutional infrastructure for digitalisation. The other scenarios need strategies to prevent risks, e.g., of technological failures or undesired social impacts. They also need strategies to cater for special cases and diversity, e.g., of ecosystems and farming practices. Across the scenarios, it seems useful to increase digital competencies of the stakeholders. The study is the first that derives implications for policy strategies from explorative scenarios of future digitalisation of agricultural systems that target gaps in achieving agricultural policy goals. The combination of developing and analysing scenarios generated findings that are of significance to policymaking stakeholders and researchers alike, who all need to address the uncertainties arising with future digitalisation of the agri-food sector.",

These impacts have been exacerbated by lack of access to reliable and timely agriculture information. Using panel phone survey data from India and Nepal, we study how women's access to agricultural extension was impacted by the lockdowns and its effect on agricultural productivity. We find that women's already low access to formal extension was reduced further, leading to an increased reliance on informal social networks. In both countries, nearly 50% farmers reported negative impacts on productivity due to inaccessibility of information during the lockdown. In India, we find that access to formal extension is mediated by crop type, geographic location and caste identity. We discuss ways in which extension systems in India and Nepal can be made more inclusive and resilient to future crisis, including by adapting group and community-based approaches to post-pandemic best practices.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global food systems. This has led to different strategies by communities, governments, and businesses involved in food systems to mitigate and adapt to the unfolding pandemic. Small Island Developing States are particularly exposed to the conflation of risks from COVID-19 disease, economic downturns, underlying climate vulnerabilities and biosecurity risks.Our study aimed to identify the food systems vulnerabilities, impacts, and opportunities for supporting resilience and sustainable development in selected Pacific Island countries, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. The study focused on the impacts from the first six months of the pandemic (February-July 2020), with remote data collection and analysis done between May and July 2020.We conducted 67 interviews, and triangulated information with desktop and news sources emerging at the time. We present results on the effect on smallholder livelihoods, supply chains, governance, communities and employment. Overall, the major impacts of COVID-19 have been on economies, posing risks to future food security and further hampering progress towards key Sustainable Development Goals.We found that unemployment and economic contraction have been the most severe effects to date, with long-term consequences for food value chains and smallholder farmers. Disruptions to tourism, labour migration, and remittances have led to varying socio-economic impacts throughout the region. Vulnerable groups, notably women, urban poor, and youth, have been disproportionately affected by unemployment. Timor-Leste has had some social protection measures, whereas in Pacific Countries these have been varied. The lockdowns and State of Emergency initially influenced the distribution and marketing of food, but local food economies are starting to stabilise. The continued functioning of international food supply chains reduced the risk of food insecurity in high import dependent nations, notably import dependent countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati.The results have significance for three recovery pathways. The first recovery pathway relates to revisiting value chains in light of restricted travel. The second recovery pathway exists through leveraging the adaptive capacities of communities to stimulate innovative agriculture that also integrates climate adaptation and nutrition. The third recovery pathway relates to addressing the structural challenges that perpetuate inequalities and poverty while finding new ways of implementing inclusive policies and research. Our study presents a set of comparative examples of managing a food system shock that can inform future systems-oriented research and policy for sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 mitigation measures including border lockdowns, social distancing, de-urbanization and restricted movements have been enforced to reduce the risks of COVID-19 arriving and spreading across PICs. To reduce the negative impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures, governments have put in place a number of interventions to sustain food and income security. Both mitigation measures and interventions have had a number of impacts on agricultural production, food systems and dietary diversity at the national and household levels.Our paper conducted an exploratory analysis of immediate impacts of both COVID-19 mitigation measures and interventions on households and communities in PICs. Our aim is to better understand the implications of COVID-19 for PICs and identify knowledge gaps requiring further research and policy attention.To understand the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures and interventions on food systems and diets in PICs, 13 communities were studied in Fiji and Solomon Islands in July-August 2020. In these communities, 46 focus group discussions were carried out and 425 households were interviewed. Insights were also derived from a series of online discussion sessions with local experts of Pacific Island food and agricultural systems in August and September 2020. To complement these discussions, an online search was conducted for available literature.Identified impacts include: 1) Reduced agricultural production, food availability and incomes due to a decline in local markets and loss of access to international markets; 2) Increased social conflict such as land disputes, theft of high-value crops and livestock, and environmental degradation resulting from urban-rural migration; 3) Reduced availability of seedlings, planting materials, equipment and labour in urban areas; 4) Reinvigoration of traditional food systems and local food production; and 5) Re-emergence of cultural safety networks and values, such as barter systems. Households in rural and urban communities appear to have responded positively to COVID-19 by increasing food production from home gardens, particularly root crops, vegetables and fruits. However, the limited diversity of agricultural production and decreased household incomes are reducing the already low dietary diversity score that existed pre-COVID-19 for households.These findings have a number of implications for future policy and practice. Future interventions would benefit from being more inclusive of diverse partners, focusing on strengthening cultural and communal values, and taking a systemic and long-term perspective. COVID-19 has provided an opportunity to strengthen traditional food systems and re-evaluate, re-imagine and re-localize agricultural production strategies and approaches in PICs.",

The aim of this paper was to analyze what factors may determine the very different diffusion of organic dairy farming in the Netherlands, compared to Denmark and Austria. We applied the Technological Innovation System (TIS) framework to the case of organic dairy farming in the Netherlands, for which a literature review and interviews with key actors within the dairy value chain were carried out. To identify potential leverage points for upscaling also interviews with key actors from Denmark and Austria were held. Various barriers in the fulfilment of the seven TIS functions of Dutch organic dairy farming could be identified. With regard to the system function market formation a diversification in certified dairy products are signaled as important factors for upscaling. The function entrepreneurial activities will benefit from an reinforcement of governmental subsidies, since farmers who convert to organic run financial risks. Regarding the function guidance of the search, more consistent and systemic governmental support is needed, since the conversion to organic encompass a regime shift rather that supporting newcomers entering the sector. By studying the blocking mechanisms that hinder diffusion of organic dairy, the paper provides several leverage points that may also be applicable to the arrested diffusion of organic farming in other countries as well as the larger sustainability transition in European agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Process-based greenhouse climate models are valuable tools for the analysis and design of greenhouse systems. A growing number of greenhouse models are published in recent years, making it difficult to identify which components are shared across models, which are new developments, and what are the objectives, strengths and weaknesses of each model. We present an overview of the current state of greenhouse modelling by analyzing studies published between 2018 and 2020. This analysis helps identify the key processes considered in process-based greenhouse models, and the common approaches used to model them. Moreover, we outline how greenhouse models differ in terms of their objectives, complexity, accuracy, and transparency. We describe a general structure of process-based greenhouse climate models, including a range of common approaches for describing the various model components. We analyze recently published models with respect to this structure, as well as their intended purposes, greenhouse systems they represent, equipment included, and crops considered. We present a model inheritance chart, outlining the origins of contemporary models, and showing which were built on previous works. We compare model validation studies and show the various types of datasets and metrics used for validation. The analysis highlights the range of objectives and approaches prevalent in greenhouse modelling, and shows that despite the large variation in model design and complexity, considerable overlap exists. Some possible reasons for the abundance of models include a lack of transparency and code availability; a belief that model development is in itself a valuable research goal; a preference for simple models in control-oriented studies; and a difference in the time scales considered. Approaches to model validation vary considerably, making it difficult to compare models or assess if they serve their intended purposes. We suggest that increased transparency and availability of source code will promote model reuse and extension, and that shared datasets and evaluation benchmarks will facilitate model evaluation and comparison. This study highlights several issues that should be considered in greenhouse model selection and development. Developers of new models can use the decomposition provided in order to present their models and facilitate extension and reuse. Developers are encouraged to reflect on and explicitly state their model's range of suitability, complexity, validity, and transparency. Lastly, we highlight several steps that could be taken by the greenhouse modelling community in order to advance the field as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing farm resilience has become a key policy objective of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to help farmers deal with numerous interrelated economic, environmental, social, and institutional shocks and stresses. A central theme in resilience thinking is the role of the unknown, implying that knowledge is incomplete and that change, uncertainty, and surprise are inevitable. Important strategies to enhance resilience are exploiting social capital and learning as these contribute to improved knowledge to prepare farmers for change. This paper explores how social capital and learning relate to farm resilience along the dimensions of robustness, adaptation, and transformation. We study the resilience of Dutch arable farmers from the Veenkoloniën and Oldambt using a combination of four methods. Qualitative data from semi-structured farmer interviews, focus groups, and expert interviews are combined with quantitative data from farmer surveys. The qualitative data are analysed using thematic coding. Non-parametric tests are used to analyse the quantitative data. Based on methodological triangulation, we mostly find convergence in our qualitative and quantitative datasets increasing the validity of our findings. The results reveal that social capital and learning help farmers to adapt and are, in certain cases, also related to robustness and transformations. Robust farmers often learned by exploiting farmers' informal social networks, primarily relying on bonding social capital to acquire knowledge about agriculture or develop financial skills. Farmers undertaking adaptation are characterised by bonding and bridging social capital obtained by formal and informal networks, are early adopters of innovation, and have high self-efficacy. Combinations of bridging and linking social capital from formal networks could foster farmers to learn new ideas and critically reflect on current farm business models. These learning outcomes relate to farm transformations. This study provides some early results on the dynamic relationship between farmers' social capital and learning and how these concepts are associated with resilience. Our findings are relevant for agricultural policy makers, as we provide recommendations on how social capital and learning have some potential to facilitate farm adaptation and transformation and improve information exchange in Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS).",

    "abstract": "The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics. The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance. This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software. We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world. Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "The use of pesticides implies negative effects on human health and the environment. Thus, the reduction in pesticide risks without harming food security and farmers' income is a key policy goal. The aim is to investigate the implications of policies that explicitly foster the large-scale adoption of pesticide-free, non-organic production systems at the national scale using Swiss crop production as an illustrative example. We develop a bio-economic modelling approach that combines agent-based modelling, a Delphi study to assess yield implications and a detailed representation of labour and machinery implications of pesticide-free, non-organic production. Using an agent-based modelling framework allows the consideration of heterogeneous farm-specific adaptation responses to voluntary direct payments for crop-specific conversion to pesticide-free but non-organic production systems. The modelling framework is used to assess the effects of changing pesticide policies on farm and sector levels and its implications for (crop-specific) food production in terms of area, volume, value and income. Our approach is illustrated using Switzerland as an example, where voluntary direct payments for a crop-specific conversion to pesticide-free but non-organic production systems will be implemented. The results show that the extent of crop-specific yield losses has an especially significant effect on the adoption rate of pesticide-free cropping systems. The impacts of introducing voluntary direct payments for pesticide-free production at the national scale imply reduced food (volume) and calorie production but only minimal reductions in the production value, especially due to expected higher prices for pesticide-free products. The effects on farmers' income are small, as participation in pesticide-free production is compensated with direct payments and higher prices and often implies cost reduction in labour and machinery due to non-use of pesticides. To establish large-scale production systems between conventional and organic cropping systems and, thereby, reduce trade-offs resulting from both extremes, policy schemes need to be flexible, allowing the adoption of a pesticide-free paradigm for some parts of the crop rotation but not necessarily entire crop rotations. This is the first national-scale study on the implications of adopting a pesticide-free, non-organic crop production system by using Swiss crop production as an illustrative example.",

    "abstract": "Global and national agricultural development policies normally tend to focus more on enhancing farm productivity through technological changes than on better use of existing technologies. The role of improving technical efficiency in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction from crop production is the least explored area in the agricultural sector. But improving technical efficiency is necessary in the context of the limited availability of existing natural resources (particularly land and water) and the need for GHG emission reduction from the agriculture sector. Technical efficiency gains in the production process are linked with the amount of input used nd the cost of production that determines both economic and environmental gains from the better use of existing technologies. To assess a relationship between technical efficiency and GHG emissions and test the hypothesis that improving technical efficiency reduces GHG emissions from crop production. This study used input-output data collected from 10,689 rice farms and 5220 wheat farms across India to estimate technical efficiency, global warming potential, and emission intensity (GHG emissions per unit of crop production) under the existing crop production practices. The GHG emissions from rice and wheat production were estimated using the CCAFS Mitigation Options Tool (CCAFS-MOT) and the technical efficiency of production was estimated through a stochastic production frontier analysis. Results suggest that improving technical efficiency in crop production can reduce emission intensity but not necessarily total emissions. Moreover, our analysis does not support smallholders tend to be technically less efficient and the emissions per unit of food produced by smallholders can be relatively high. Alarge proportion of smallholders have high technical efficiency, less total GHG emissions, and low emissions intensity. This study indicates the levels of technical efficiency and GHG emission are largely influenced by farming typology, i.e. choice and use of existing technologies and management practices in crop cultivation. This study will help to promote existing improved technologies targeting GHG emissions reduction from the agriculture production systems.",

    "abstract": "Narratives dominate the agricultural discourse that digitalisation is the ‘silver bullet’ to agricultural, environmental, and global issues, resulting in an external push towards automation and a rapid increase in digital technologies in the sector. Concentrated productivist views and techno-optimist hype and momentum is carrying us briskly towards a digital farming revolution, with little conversation or consideration of the social impacts of digitalisation. The application of social science research to digital agriculture is relatively new and the pace at which it has been developing to keep up with digital advances in the sector has left this body of literature scattered and lacking sufficient overview. To address this, a scoping study was conducted on social and behavioural science literature related to digital agriculture. This scoping study, which incorporates 200 references, pays particular attention to stakeholder engagement and how agricultural digitalisation has been developing. This methodology enables us to provide an extensive overview of this field of research, presenting key themes pertaining to the literature including barriers and facilitators of, as well as anticipated positive and negative impacts of digital technology adoption. We find that whilst there has been a general win-win, techno-positive narrative in the agricultural sector, proof of these benefits is limited and some technologies are eliciting negative effects to its users, transforming the landscape of agriculture. In order to be responsive to these negative consequences, it is important that we turn our attention upstream to examine how technologies are designed and developed for use in an agricultural context. This can be achieved by integrating more inclusive approaches to technology design. These approaches will help to mitigate negative effects of technologies, help to create successful and responsible innovations, tackle low adoption issues, and help to create more responsible digital futures.",

    "abstract": "Mission-oriented agricultural innovation systems (MAIS) are becoming more prevalent in view of tackling the challenges of agri-food systems transformation. In this perspective, we argue that the politics of MAIS requires more comprehensive and considerable attention in the field, given the contested and deeply normative nature of the direction of innovations in agri-food systems transformation. Literature from development studies, policy sciences, and transition studies is reviewed to inform the perspective. We question the politics of MAIS structured around the dimensions of the 4D framework: directionality, diversity, distribution and democracy. Regarding directionality, MAIS should explicitly consider how power dynamics shape the direction of innovation and future agri-food systems, and to which extent these power dynamics hinder desirable directions. Considering diversity means that MAIS need to stimulate a diversity of transformation pathways; include a diversity of actors, communities and knowledge; and consider roles of both humans and non-humans in transformation. Questions regarding the distribution of resources and effects of innovations across ecosystems and communities imply that MAIS should actively advance just transitions across different scales and geographical contexts. Finally, democratization of MAIS in our view means that the ways in which knowledge and innovations are produced through MAIS should be more democratic and deliberative, though this may be challenging since missions imply strong steering. We stress that these 4D considerations also bring along important implications for the ways policies and research on and in MAIS, and agri-food system transformation more broadly, are considered. Confronting the politics of MAIS is not an easy endeavor, but critical to advance agri-food system transformation in directions that are not only sustainable and transformative, but also socially just and desirable. This requires for agricultural systems researchers to develop awareness on how their work feeds into the politics of MAIS, and conversely is influenced by it.",

    "abstract": "Circular resource use in agriculture and food systems could play an important role when aiming for sufficient food output with limited environmental impact and resource depletion. Circularity, however, is not a goal in itself. With respect to nutrient use and emissions, agricultural system sustainability is currently commonly assessed by nutrient output/input ratio (O/I, nutrient use efficiency) or surplus per ha (IO). Our aim is to assess how these sustainability indicators are related to nutrient cycling. Starting from basic circularity concepts, a set of equations (frame) is presented that relates nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling to food product output, or to food use by human consumers. Circularity indicators express how many times a nutrient input cohort completes a full cycle (CyCt), or passes through the system's top trophic compartment (UseCt). Examples of such compartments are the crop (arable systems), the herd (livestock farms), and the human population (regional food systems). UseCt governs export in useful product. The frame allows to predict equilibrium O/I from system properties, and to attribute parts of O/I to direct (linear) and cycled flow. CyCtR quantifies how many cycles could be completed by nutrients in absence of product export. CyCtR allows to assess the efficacy of returning waste from exported products. Above indicators are compared against Finn cycling index and Figge circularity index, more commonly used in ecological and industrial research respectively. All indicators are calculated for systems of increasing complexity: (i) a UK wheat field, (ii) a Dutch dairy farm, and (iii) the Flanders regional food system. Their responses to changes in system properties are analysed for examples ii and iii. Nutrient flows in UK arable field and Flanders are almost linear. In UK arable field, O/I equals 0.74 (N) and 0.66 (P), with small contributions from cycled flow (9% for N, 5% for P). In Flanders, cycled flow constitutes only 2% of total N and P flows that reach the human consumer in Flanders. The dairy farm shows largest contributions of cycled flow: 35% (N) and 60% (P) of O/I comes from cycled flow, but O/I itself is only 0.28 (N) and 0.72 (P). The presented frame allows to assess the impacts of system changes on productivity, nutrient cycling, resource use and nutrient emissions. This is useful for ex-ante assessment of measures that reduce nutrient losses from the system or increase the retrieval of external waste flows.",

    "abstract": "Multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs), which involve the collective action of various institutions such as governments, private companies, NGOs, and donors, have become a popular approach for developing agricultural value chains to improve the sustainability of food systems. However, the growing body of literature presents a range of terms, concepts, and definitions related to MSPs, potentially causing confusion and obscuring the distinctions between different types of partnerships. While the potential benefits of MSPs have been extensively explored in the literature, there remains a need to investigate their realized impacts across regions to enable a more robust synthesis. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on MSPs in agricultural development, specifically examining the various concepts employed and assessing their realized impacts on farmers, focusing on developing countries. We systematically reviewed the literature on MSPs and identified 147 studies dealing with a different type of MSPs and 79 studies reporting the impact. We found that twelve terms have been used to describe MSPs. However, a single MSP initiative may be referred to by different names in various documents, indicating a lack of consensus on the defining characteristics of such partnerships. Positive impacts were reported on farmers' economic, social, and technological aspects, as well as environmental adaptation practices to address climate change. Nevertheless, the reported impacts tend to focus primarily on economic, technological, and social dimensions while giving less attention to environmental aspects. This paper presents, firstly, a comprehensive overview of the diverse practices of MSPs in developing countries. Secondly, it analyses the contributions made by MSPs across various commodities and regions in the development of agricultural value chains.",

    "abstract": "Inland saline intrusion is occurring during the dry season in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), Vietnam. Rising sea levels, tidal fluctuations, drought, and changes to upstream flow contribute to extensive salinisation of rice producing areas of the MRD, leading to substantial rice crop losses. The identification, evaluation and implementation of alternative crop and soil management solutions are required to complement on-going rice production in the region. A review of scientific and grey literature was conducted regarding the nature and extent of salinisation in the MRD and the adoption and management of alternative crops to rice. Familiar crops in Vietnam (e.g., maize, soybean), as well as novel crops to the MRD (e.g., quinoa, cowpea) were explored as potential options to replace dry season rice. Management options including surface soil mulches and plastic coverings help maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of drainage and seed preparation techniques can improve plant establishment and yield. Factors contributing to the success of alternative crops include salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry growing season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labour intensiveness and the crops' marketability. The identification of suitable alternative crops to replace dry season rice in saline affected areas of the MRD, combined with management practices like mulching and soil moisture monitoring, could provide farmers with income opportunities to offset rice losses. Documenting the factors contributing to successful crop diversification can assist with decision-making and support initiatives among farmers, agribusiness, and government agencies.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of precision agriculture technologies has brought forward new opportunities and challenges in the agricultural sector. We delve into the role of living labs as dynamic platforms for fostering responsible innovation in precision agriculture. We highlight our early experiences regarding processes and best practices by which an interdisciplinary research team uses living labs as a methodological approach to design and test trustworthy PA innovation. Our living labs methodology is composed of five interrelated activities: (a) face-to-face interviews and surveys with farmers, (b) multidimensional field data collection and analysis, (c) a quasi-field experiment and serious games to test the effectiveness of sensor-driven performance-based payment for improving ecosystem services, (d) design workshops, and (e) extension and outreach of PA tools and knowledge to farmers and rural communities. Our initial findings demonstrate how living labs can be leveraged to co-create sustainable solutions that are socially and economically responsive to the challenges of farmers and rural communities, and environmentally sustainable. Our research underscores the importance of including experts from various fields to collaborate and contribute to innovation development. We share the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing living labs in the context of precision agriculture technologies. By sharing our early experiences in establishing living labs in the United States, we aim to contribute to the promotion of inclusive and responsible innovation within the living lab community and offer valuable guidance to other researchers embarking on similar initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Intensive food and feed production in sole-cropped, large fields with high fertilizer and pesticide inputs to achieve high yields, has contributed to detrimental environmental impacts. To move towards more sustainable agricultural landscapes, cropping system diversification has been suggested as a promising practice for which the use of digital technologies could be potentially beneficial. Understanding the impact of diversified, newly arranged cropping systems and their management requires long-term experimental data at the landscape scale and practical experiences in using digital technologies which are hardly available. Experimental platforms in an agricultural landscape setup with farmers' involvement could meet such demands but have not been set up in many regions nor has the process of designing such platforms been described systematically. The overall objective of this study was to describe how an experimental platform can be co-designed jointly by researchers and practitioners to study and understand the impact of diversification practices compared to current cropping systems in Eastern Brandenburg, Germany. Specifically, we aimed to re-design an intensively managed field into smaller field segments that we called patches and to assess the potential of a co-created landscape experiment for sustainable agricultural production focussing on both, the practitioners´ and scientists´ perspective. We used the DEED research cycle (Describe, Explain, Explore and Design) as a conceptual framework to co-design the landscape experiment called patchCROP within a commercial farm. Patches were implemented as 0.5 ha fields within the original field based on yield and soil maps using advanced cluster analysis which considered soil heterogeneity. The original narrow crop sequence was diversified by integrating new crops, cover crops and flower strips for a five-year crop rotation. To cultivate the patches, large machinery was used during the first years but will be replaced over time with autonomous field robots. Workshops and various methods such as a SWOT analysis were used to adjust the management practices towards pesticide reduction. The SWOT analysis revealed opportunities and drawbacks to develop such a research platform in a participative manner from both the scientific and practical farming perspective. We found that the farmer-centric position focused mainly on the economic return and feasibility of future field operations in the diversified field. The scientific perspective on the other hand described needs and potentials about the research process for evaluating dynamic, interdependent or opposing natural processes and their interactions like productivity, biodiversity and ecosystem service changes in an agricultural landscape context. Co-designed landscape experiments have the potential to simultaneously assess the impact of newly developed cropping systems on biodiversity and ecosystem services beyond the field level, crop performance and soil quality at multiple scales, and the implications for multiple actors. This is a step forward to extend systems-based research from single plot to landscape research in an on-farm environment, allowing the exploration of diversification measures with new digital technologies in the long run.",

    "abstract": "Rapid social-ecological changes such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource overexploitation are threatening food security, livelihoods, and local knowledge of small-scale farmers worldwide. There has been a call from scientists, farmers, and activists to identify and promote the mechanisms for sustaining resilient farming livelihoods. We hypothesize that small-scale farmers who are more knowledgeable about changes in their environment are more resilient to current social-ecological changes as they might be more prepared to respond to these disturbances. Our objective is to understand how Indigenous and local knowledge on social-ecological changes is associated with small-scale farmers' livelihood resilience in the Chiloé Archipelago, a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System and Global Biodiversity Hotspot in southern South America. We conducted 100 surveys with small-scale farmers whose main livelihood activity relied on agrosilvopastoral systems. By asking questions about noticed changes in the atmospheric, physical, biological, and human system, we built an Index of Knowledge on Social-Ecological Changes. We also built an Index of Livelihood Resilience based on households' information on indicators of five capital assets (i.e., financial, human, social, physical, and natural). Finally, by using general linear mixed models, we tested the association between the Index of Knowledge on Social-Ecological Changes, individual capital assets, and the Index of Livelihood Resilience. We found that the level of small-scale farmers' knowledge was similar across the different systems (atmospheric, physical, biological, and human). We observed a significant positive association between the Index of Knowledge on Social-Ecological Changes and the Index of Livelihood Resilience, as well as with the natural, social, and physical capital of small-scale farmers. By demonstrating the positive association between measures of Indigenous and local knowledge on social-ecological changes and indicators of livelihood resilience, our results suggest that people who are more knowledgeable about changes in their environment might be more prepared to respond to disturbances. While there might be other factors influencing livelihood resilience, our study highlights the importance of leveraging Indigenous and local knowledge, and their respective holders, when planning responses to current social-ecological crises.",

    "abstract": "As a result of population growth, urbanization and climate change, agricultural systems around the world face enormous pressure on the use of resources. There is a pressing need for wide-scale innovation leading to development that improves the livelihoods and food security of the world's population while at the same time addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. A variety of promising climate-smart interventions have been identified. However, what remains is the prioritization of interventions for investment and broad dissemination. The suitability and adoption of interventions depends on a variety of bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Also their impacts, when adopted and out-scaled, are likely to be highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity expresses itself not only spatially and temporally but also in terms of the stakeholders affected, some might win and some might lose. A mechanism that can facilitate a systematic, holistic assessment of the likely spread and consequential impact of potential interventions is one way of improving the selection and targeting of such options. In this paper we provide climate smart agriculture (CSA) planners and implementers at all levels with a generic framework for evaluating and prioritising potential interventions. This entails an iterative process of mapping out recommendation domains, assessing adoption potential and estimating impacts. Through examples, related to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa, we demonstrate each of the steps and how they are interlinked. The framework is applicable in many different forms, scales and settings. It has a wide applicability beyond the examples presented and we hope to stimulate readers to integrate the concepts in the planning process for climate-smart agriculture, which invariably involves multi-stakeholder, multi-scale and multi-objective decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Crop-livestock production systems play an important role in the livelihoods of many rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Understanding which farming options will give the highest return on investment in light of climate change is critical information for decision-making. While there is continued investment in testing adaptation options using on-farm experiments, simulation models remain important tools for 'ex-ante' assessments of the impacts of proposed climate-smart agricultural technologies (CSA). This study used the Ruminant model and the Trade-offs Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to assess how improved livestock management options affect the three pillars of CSA: increased productivity, improved food security, and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our sample was stratified into: 1) households with local cow breeds (n = 28); 2) households with improved dairy cow breeds (n = 70); and 3) households without dairy cows (n = 66). Results showed that the predicted adoption rates for improved livestock feeding among households with improved dairy cows (stratum 2) were likely to be higher compared to households with only local cows (stratum 1). Both households with local cows and those with improved cows had increased income and food security. However, overall poverty reduction was only modest for households with local cows. Expected methane emissions intensity declined with adoption of improved livestock feeding strategies both in stratum 1 and stratum 2, and greater impacts were observed when households in stratum 2 received an additional improved cow breed. Providing a cow to households that were not keeping cows showed substantial economic gains. Additional research is, however, needed to understand why those farms currently do not have cows, which may determine if the predicted adoption rates are feasible.",

    "abstract": "The topic of food loss and waste has risen in importance since the revelation that an estimated 40% of food in America is never consumed. Losses at the field level, however, are not well understood, and economic and growing conditions that dictate decisions made by fruit and vegetable growers can determine how much food is left unharvested. Many strategies have been suggested to reduce food loss and waste, but their development has been informed by concerns at the consumer level, and may not motivate growers to reduce losses. This study sought to understand how growers make decisions regarding when to end the harvest, and explores growers' perceptions of strategies that would incentivize them to reduce losses. The authors conducted seventeen semi-structured interviews with mid-sized to large commercial vegetable growers in North Carolina. The resulting findings clarify the primary decision-making drivers affecting food loss in the field, including whether growers have an interested buyer, the quality of the produce, the available price, the financial risk of product rejection, and the priority of another field becoming mature and ready to harvest. Growers did not perceive losses to be of high enough volume or value to measure crops that were left unharvested in the field, though research indicates that the volume is actually significant. We also asked growers about their perceptions of strategies for reducing farm level losses that have been promoted in industry reports on the subject. These strategies include facilitating donation and supporting emerging markets that focus on imperfect produce. Neither of these aligned well with strategies that growers perceived as important, such as increasing demand, providing processing infrastructure, and facilitating a consistent market and prices. While some growers donate produce or participate in gleaning, these activities can be limited by continued negative perceptions. Findings from this research suggest that, in order to effectively reduce the loss of edible food at the farm level, growers must be included in the development of strategies, and those strategies must incentivize their participation in order to be effective.",

    "abstract": "In most landscapes, accurate crop yield forecasting depends on a quantitative understanding of the relation between past weather, management and crop yield variability. We evaluated and improved the regression-based crop yield forecasting methodology currently employed in the MARS-Crop Yield Forecasting System (M-CYFS) for maize in Hungary. We quantified the effect of: 1) different statistical trends; 2) different crop growth simulation model outputs providing weekly predictors; 3) yield prediction lead times; and 4) spatial aggregation on the forecast accuracy as evaluated against statistical yield from 1993 to 2012. The LOESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) trend provided the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) in describing the yield time-series compared to the quadratic and linear trend. Using the WOFOST crop model-based predictors to explain the yield residuals derived with each of the three trends, the lowest RMSEs were obtained with the Water Limited Leaf Area Index (WLLAI) and Water Limited Above Ground Biomass (WLB) predictors in combination with the LOESS trend. The LOESS trend was used to evaluate the effect of spatially aggregating subnational yield forecasts. During the first half of the crop cycle there are only marginal differences between the NUTS0 (national), NUTS1 (supra-regional), NUTS2 (regional), and NUTS3 (sub-regional) level. However, the NUTS0 forecast had a slightly lower accuracy from the start of flowering and onwards, indicating the possible benefit of maintaining spatial detail when aggregating data. The RMSE of the forecasts started to decrease in weeks 24 and 25. Even though the relative soil moisture decreased earliest, the best performing yield forecasts were associated with lead times of about 5–8 weeks before harvest and were obtained with the WLLAI and WLB as predictors. The best forecasts were associated with the critical phenological phases of flowering and grain-filling respectively occurring between weeks 27 to 30 and weeks 31 to 35. The best performing national forecast was based on NUTS1 level forecasts with an r2 and a RMSE of respectively 0.8565 and 425.9 kg ha− 1 using WLLAI as predictor. Finally, we compared the regression-based forecasts with operational forecasts performed by the Ministry of Agriculture of Hungary and the JRC-MARS forecasts from 2007 to 2012.",

    "abstract": "Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) conceptually has the potential to contribute to the sustainable development goals of achieving zero hunger, reducing land degradation, eliminating poverty, tackling climate change, and promoting gender equality. The scaling-up needed to achieve goals of CSA represents a challenge, as it entails understanding synergies between often opposing socioeconomic and environmental priorities and trade-offs over temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we tested new approaches to support scaling-up of sustainable food production through investigating the contribution of systems thinking as a conceptual approach and complex adaptive system (CAS) attributes as a framework for analysis of CSA. This was done through examining (i) to what extent CSA represents a CAS and (ii) what contribution systems thinking and CAS attributes can make to understanding and scaling-up sustainable food production systems through CSA. The CSA situation was conceptualized through systems thinking sessions with women farmers in the climate-smart village (CSV) of Doggoh-Jirapa, northern Ghana, and was guided by the Distinctions, Systems, Relationships and Perspectives (DSRP) framework. Systems thinking, and CAS attributes provide system-wide understanding of elements, dynamics and trade-offs over temporal and spatial scale in selected agri-food systems. As such it could aid horizontal and vertical scaling-up by informing policy developoment and selection of a context-specific portfolio of technologies and practices at landscape and farm levels to achieve synergies between goals. In this study, systems thinking enabled women farmers in the CSV to identify income-generating and tree planting activities, with desirable simultaneous system-wide impact. The paper calls for further testing of tools, approaches, and methods that enable dynamic systems thinking to inform scaling-up efforts, while embracing the transdisciplinary nature and complexity of CSA as a constituent of the food production system.",

    "abstract": "In this study we estimate yield gaps for mixed crop-livestock smallholder farmers in seven Sub-Saharan African sites covering six countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Senegal and Burkina Faso). We also assess their potential to increase food production and reduce the GHG emission intensity of their products, as a result of closing these yield gaps. We use stochastic frontier analysis to construct separate production frontiers for each site, based on 2012 survey data prepared by the International Livestock Research Institute for the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security program. Instead of relying on theoretically optimal yields-a common approach in yield gap assessments-our yield gaps are based on observed differences in technical efficiency among farms within each site. Sizeable yield gaps were estimated to be present in all of the sites. Expressed as potential percentage increases in outputs, the average site-based yield gaps ranged from 28 to 167% for livestock products and from 16 to 209% for crop products. The emission intensities of both livestock and crop products registered substantial falls as a consequence of closing yield gaps. The relationships between farm attributes and technical efficiency were also assessed to help inform policy makers about where best to target capacity building efforts. We found a strong and statistically significant relationship between market participation and performance across most sites. We also identified an efficiency dividend associated with the closer integration of crop and livestock enterprises. Overall, this study reveals that there are large yield gaps and that substantial benefits for food production and environmental performance are possible through closing these gaps, without the need for new technology.",

    "abstract": "Crop growth simulation models can differ greatly in their treatment of key processes and hence in their response to environmental conditions. Here, we used an ensemble of 26 process-based wheat models applied at sites across a European transect to compare their sensitivity to changes in temperature (−2 to +9°C) and precipitation (−50 to +50%). Model results were analysed by plotting them as impact response surfaces (IRSs), classifying the IRS patterns of individual model simulations, describing these classes and analysing factors that may explain the major differences in model responses. The model ensemble was used to simulate yields of winter and spring wheat at four sites in Finland, Germany and Spain. Results were plotted as IRSs that show changes in yields relative to the baseline with respect to temperature and precipitation. IRSs of 30-year means and selected extreme years were classified using two approaches describing their pattern. The expert diagnostic approach (EDA) combines two aspects of IRS patterns: location of the maximum yield (nine classes) and strength of the yield response with respect to climate (four classes), resulting in a total of 36 combined classes defined using criteria pre-specified by experts. The statistical diagnostic approach (SDA) groups IRSs by comparing their pattern and magnitude, without attempting to interpret these features. It applies a hierarchical clustering method, grouping response patterns using a distance metric that combines the spatial correlation and Euclidian distance between IRS pairs. The two approaches were used to investigate whether different patterns of yield response could be related to different properties of the crop models, specifically their genealogy, calibration and process description. Although no single model property across a large model ensemble was found to explain the integrated yield response to temperature and precipitation perturbations, the application of the EDA and SDA approaches revealed their capability to distinguish: (i) stronger yield responses to precipitation for winter wheat than spring wheat; (ii) differing strengths of response to climate changes for years with anomalous weather conditions compared to period-average conditions; (iii) the influence of site conditions on yield patterns; (iv) similarities in IRS patterns among models with related genealogy; (v) similarities in IRS patterns for models with simpler process descriptions of root growth and water uptake compared to those with more complex descriptions; and (vi) a closer correspondence of IRS patterns in models using partitioning schemes to represent yield formation than in those using a harvest index. Such results can inform future crop modelling studies that seek to exploit the diversity of multi-model ensembles, by distinguishing ensemble members that span a wide range of responses as well as those that display implausible behaviour or strong mutual similarities.",

    "abstract": "Rwanda's agricultural sector is facing severe challenges of increasing environmental degradation, resulting in declining productivity. The problem is likely to be further aggravated by the growing population pressure. A viable pathway is climate smart agriculture, aiming at the triple win of improving food security and climate change adaptation, while contributing to mitigation if possible. The Government of Rwanda has initiated ambitious policies and programs aiming at low emission agricultural development. Crop focused policies include the Crop Intensification Program (CIP) which facilitates access to inorganic fertilizer and improved seeds. In the livestock subsector, zero-grazing and improved livestock feeding are encouraged, and the Girinka program provides poor farm households with a crossbred dairy cow. In this study, we aimed at assessing the potential impact of these policy programs on food availability and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 884 households across different agro-ecologies and farming systems in Rwanda. Household level calculations were used to assess the contribution of current crops, livestock and off-farm activities to food availability and GHG emissions. Across all sites, 46% of households were below the 2500 kcal MAE− 1 yr− 1 line, with lower food availability in the Southern and Eastern Rwanda. Consumed and sold food crops were the mainstay of food availability, contributing between 81.2% (low FA class) to 53.1% (high FA class). Livestock and off-farm income were the most important pathways to higher FA. Baseline GHG emissions were low, ranging between 395 and 1506 kg CO2e hh− 1 yr− 1 per site, and livestock related emissions from enteric fermentation (47.6–48.9%) and manure (26.7–31.8%) were the largest contributors to total GHG emissions across sites and FA classes. GHG emissions increased with FA, with 50% of the total GHG being emitted by 22% of the households with the highest FA scores. Scenario assessment of the three policy options showed strong differences in potential impacts: Girinka only reached one third of the household population, but acted highly pro-poor by decreasing the households below the 2500 kcal MAE− 1 yr− 1 line from 46% to 35%. However, Girinka also increased GHG by 1174 kg CO2e hh− 1 yr− 1, and can therefore not be considered climate-smart. Improved livestock feeding was the least equitable strategy, decreasing food insufficient households by only 3%. However, it increased median FA by 755 kcal MAE− 1 yr− 1 at a small GHG increase (50 kg CO2e hh− 1 yr− 1). Therefore, it is a promising option to reach the CSA triple win. Crop and soil improvement resulted in the smallest increase in median FA (FA by 322 kcal MAE− 1 yr− 1), and decreasing the proportion of households below 2500 kcal MAE− 1 yr− 1 by 6%. This came only at minimal increase in GHG emissions (23 kg CO2e hh− 1 yr− 1). All policy programs had different potential impacts and trade-offs on different sections of the farm household population. Quick calculations like the ones presented in this study can assist in policy dialogue and stakeholder engagement to better select and prioritize policies and development programs, despite the complexity of its impacts and trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "In Africa, the agricultural sector is the largest sector of the domestic economy, and livestock, are a crucial component of agriculture, accounting for ~ 45% of the Kenyan agricultural GDP and > 70% of African agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accurate estimates of GHG emissions from livestock are required for inventory purposes and to assess the efficacy of mitigation measures, but most estimates rely on TIER I (default) IPCC protocols with major uncertainties coming from the IPCC methodology itself. Tier II estimates represent a significant improvement over the default methodology, however in less developed economies the required information is lacking or of uncertain reliability. In this study we developed an alternative methodology based on animal energy requirements derived from field measurements of live weight, live weight change, milk production and locomotion to estimate intake. Using on-farm data, we analysed feed samples to produce estimates of digestibility by season and region, then and used these data to estimate daily methane production by season, area and class of animal to produce new emission factors (EF) for annual enteric CH4 production. Mean Dry Matter Digestibility of the feed basket was in the range of 58–64%, depending on region and season (around 10% greater than TIER I estimates). EFs were substantially lower for adolescent and adult male (30.1, 35.9 versus 49 kg CH4) and for adolescent and adult female (23.0, 28.3 versus 41 kg), but not calves (15.7 versus 16 kg) than those given for \"other\" African cattle in IPCC (Tier I) estimates. It is stressed that this study is the first of its kind for Sub-Sharan Africa relying on animal measurements, but should not automatically be extrapolated outside of its geographic range. It does however, point out the need for further measurements, and highlights the value of using a robust methodology which does not rely on the (often invalid) assumption of ad libitum intake in systems where intake is known or likely to be restricted.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural mechanization has often been associated with scale-effects and increased specialization. Such characterizations, however, fail to explain how mechanization may grow in Africa where production environments are heterogeneous even within a farm household, and crop diversification may help in mitigating risks. Using panel data from farm households and crop-specific production costs in Nigeria, we estimate how the adoptions of animal traction or tractors affect the economies of scope (EOS) for rice, non-rice grains, and legumes/seeds, which are the crop groups that are most widely grown with animal traction or tractors in Nigeria, with respect to other non-rice crops. The inverse-probability-weighting method is used to address the potential endogeneity of mechanization adoption and is combined with primal- and dual-models of EOS estimation. The results show that the adoption of these mechanization technologies is associated with greater EOS between rice and non-rice crops but lower EOS among non-rice crops (i.e., between non-rice grains, legumes/seeds, and other non-rice crops). Mechanical technologies may raise EOS between crops that are grown in more heterogeneous environments, even though it may lower EOS between crops that are grown under relatively similar agroecological conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that shows the effects of mechanical technologies on EOS in agriculture in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Livestock provides an important source of income and nourishment for around one billion rural households worldwide. Demand for livestock food products is increasing, especially in developing countries, and there are opportunities to increase production to meet local demand and increase farm incomes. Estimating the scale of livestock yield gaps and better understanding factors limiting current production will help to define the technological and investment needs in each livestock sector. The aim of this paper is to quantify livestock yield gaps and evaluate opportunities to increase dairy production in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, using case studies from Ethiopia and India. We combined three different methods in our approach. Benchmarking and a frontier analysis were used to estimate attainable milk yields based on survey data. Household modelling was then used to simulate the effects of various interventions on dairy production and income. We tested interventions based on improved livestock nutrition and genetics in the extensive lowland grazing zone and highland mixed crop-livestock zones of Ethiopia, and the intensive irrigated and rainfed zones of India. Our analyses indicate that there are considerable yield gaps for dairy production in both countries, and opportunities to increase production using the interventions tested. In some cases, combined interventions could increase production past currently attainable livestock yields.",

    "abstract": "Agroforestry systems, containing mixtures of trees and crops, are often promoted because the net effect of interactions between woody and herbaceous components is thought to be positive if evaluated over the long term. From a modelling perspective, agroforestry has received much less attention than monocultures. However, for the potential of agroforestry to impact food security in Africa to be fully evaluated, models are required that accurately predict crop yields in the presence of trees. The positive effects of the fertiliser tree gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) on maize (Zea mays) are well documented and use of this tree-crop combination to increase crop production is expanding in several African countries. Simulation of gliricidia-maize interactions can complement field trials by predicting crop response across a broader range of contexts than can be achieved by experimentation alone. We tested a model developed within the APSIM framework. APSIM models are widely used for one dimensional (1D), process-based simulation of crops such as maize and wheat in monoculture. The Next Generation version of APSIM was used here to test a 2D agroforestry model where maize growth and yield varied spatially in response to interactions with gliricidia. The simulations were done using data for gliricidia-maize interactions over two years (short-term) in Kenya and 11 years (long-term) in Malawi, with differing proportions of trees and crops and contrasting management. Predictions were compared with observations for maize grain yield, and soil water content. Simulations in Kenya were in agreement with observed yields reflecting lower observed maize germination in rows close to gliricidia. Soil water content was also adequately simulated, except for a tendency for slower simulated drying of the soil profile each season. Simulated maize yields in Malawi were also in agreement with observations. Trends in soil carbon over a decade were similar to those measured, but could not be statistically evaluated. These results show that the agroforestry model in APSIM Next Generation adequately represented tree-crop interactions in these two contrasting agro-ecological conditions and agroforestry practices. Further testing of the model is warranted to explore tree-crop interactions under a wider range of environmental conditions.",

The NDC is also noteworthy in focussing on emissions from deforestation control and land use change. Agricultural intensification is a key component of the offer, potentially allowing the country to make credible mitigation commitments that are aligned with a national development strategy of halting deforestation in the Amazon, and increasing livestock production. This apparent contradiction is potentially resolved by understanding the technical, economic and policy feasibility of intensification by pasture restoration. We use bio-economic modelling to demonstrate the extent of cost-effective mitigation that could be delivered by this measure, and to show a result that underpins the target of zero deforestation in Brazil. The analysis was requested by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture prior to the NDC announcement at COP21 by the Government of Brazil. The study provided the basis of the livestock sector contribution to the NDC and highlights the on-going role of effective deforestation control policies. It also contributes to the global debate on land sparing by sustainable agricultural intensification.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1980s, many developing countries have introduced policies to promote seed industry growth and improve the delivery of modern science to farmers, often with a long-term goal of increasing agricultural productivity in smallholder farming systems. Public, private, and civil society actors involved in shaping policy designs have, in turn, developed competing narratives around how best to build an innovative and sustainable seed system, each with varying goals, values, and levels of influence. Efforts to strike a balance between these narratives have often played out in passionate discourses surrounding seed rules and regulations. As a result, however, policymakers in many countries have expressed impatience with the slow progress on enhancing the contribution of a modern seed industry to the overarching goal of increasing agricultural productivity growth. One reason for this slow progress may be that policymakers are insufficiently cognizant of the trade-offs associated with rules and regulations required to effectively govern a modern seed industry. This suggests the need for new data and analysis to improve the understanding of how seed systems function. This paper explores these issues in the context of Asia's rapidly growing seed industry, with illustrations from seed markets for maize and several other crops, to highlight current gaps in the metrics used to analyze performance, competition, and innovation. The paper provides a finite set of indicators to inform policymaking on seed system design and monitoring, and explores how these indicators can be used to inform current policy debates in the region.",

    "abstract": "Global warming is predicted to increase in the future, with detrimental consequences for rainfed crops that are dependent on natural rainfall (i.e. non-irrigated). Given that many crops grown under rainfed conditions support the livelihoods of low-income farmers, it is important to highlight the vulnerability of rainfed areas to climate change in order to anticipate potential risks to food security. In this paper, we focus on India, where ~ 50% of rice is grown under rainfed conditions, and we employ statistical models (climate envelope models (CEMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs)) to map changes in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation at a regional level (~ 18 × 18 km cell resolution) under projected future (2050) climate change (IPCC RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, using three GCMs: BCC-CSM1.1, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and HadGEM2-ES). We quantify the occurrence of rice (whether or not rainfed rice is commonly grown, using CEMs) and rice extent (area under cultivation, using BRTs) during the summer monsoon in relation to four climate variables that affect rice growth and yield namely ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration (PER), maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), and total rainfall during harvesting. Our models described the occurrence and extent of rice very well (CEMs for occurrence, ensemble AUC = 0.92; BRTs for extent, Pearson's r = 0.87). PER was the most important predictor of rainfed rice occurrence, and it was positively related to rainfed rice area, but all four climate variables were important for determining the extent of rice cultivation. Our models project that 15%–40% of current rainfed rice growing areas will be at risk (i.e. decline in climate suitability or become completely unsuitable). However, our models project considerable variation across India in the impact of future climate change: eastern and northern India are the locations most at risk, but parts of central and western India may benefit from increased precipitation. Hence our CEM and BRT models agree on the locations most at risk, but there is less consensus about the degree of risk at these locations. Our results help to identify locations where livelihoods of low-income farmers and regional food security may be threatened in the next few decades by climate changes. The use of more drought-resilient rice varieties and better irrigation infrastructure in these regions may help to reduce these impacts and reduce the vulnerability of farmers dependent on rainfed cropping.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly complex challenges facing agricultural systems require problem-solving processes and systems analysis (SA) tools that engage multiple actors across disciplines. In this article, we employ the theory of affordances to unravel what tools may furnish users, and how those affordances contribute to a tool's usefulness in co-design and co-innovation processes. Affordance is defined as a function provided by an object through an interaction with a user. We first present a conceptual framework to assess the affordances of SA tools. This framework is then applied in a literature review of three SA tools used in agricultural systems research (fuzzy cognitive mapping, bio-economic whole-farm models, and role play and serious games). Through this exercise, we extend the SA tool design and implementation dialogue by illuminating (i) links between lower-level affordances, tool design, and heuristic functioning, and (ii) the central role of use setting and facilitation in mobilizing higher-level, productive affordances. Based on our findings, we make five propositions for how SA tool design and implementation in participatory problem-solving settings can be improved.",

    "abstract": "Maize is an important staple crop in Ethiopia. Reducing the yield gap - the difference between actual and (water-limited) potential yield - has wide implications for food security and policy. In this paper we combine stochastic frontier analysis of household survey data with agronomic information on (water-limited) potential yield to decompose the maize yield gap in Ethiopia and highlight policy solutions to reduce the yield gap. Our analysis suggests that lack of access to advanced technologies makes up the largest component of the maize yield gap but market imperfections, economic constraints and management constraints are also important determinants. Potentially, maize production can be increased almost fivefold if all these constraints would be addressed simultaneously and the yield gap could be fully closed. Another finding of the paper is measurement issues in the national household survey (LSMS-ISA), a key source of information for scientists to assess agricultural policies in Ethiopia and other African countries. A comparison with results from a crop model suggests a large number of unrealistic values related to key maize input and output variables. Combining economic and agronomic approaches is therefore not only useful to identify policies to reduce maize yield gaps, but also to assess and improve the quality of data-bases on which recommendations are made.",

    "abstract": "The promotion of climate-smart agriculture in different parts of the world requires a clear understanding of its relative suitability, costs and benefits, and the environmental implications of various technological interventions in a local context under current and future climates. Such data are generally difficult to obtain from the literature, field surveys and focused group discussions, or from biophysical experiments. This article describes a spreadsheet-based methodology that generates this information based on a region specific production function and 'target yield' approach in current and future climate scenarios. Target yields are identified for homogeneous agroecological spatial units using published crop yield datasets, crop models, expert judgement, biophysical land characterisations, assessment of yield gaps and future development strategies. Validated production/transfer functions are used to establish relationships between inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, machinery, energy, labour, costs) and outputs (crop yields, residues, water and fertiliser use efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions, financial returns). The process is repeated for all spatial units of the region, identified through detailed mapping of critical biophysical factors, and for all suitable current and potential agronomic production technologies and practices. The application of this approach is illustrated for prioritizing agronomic interventions that can enhance productivity and incomes, help farmers adapt to current risk, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in current and future climates for the flood- and drought-prone state of Bihar in north-eastern India. In general, climate smartness increases with advanced technologies. Yield is the least limiting while emission is the most limiting factor across the entire crop-technology portfolio for climate smartness. Finally, we present a robust climate smart land use plan at district level in Bihar under current and future climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "19,980 crop yield forecasts have been published for the European Union (EU) Member States (MS) during 1993-2015 using the MARS-Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS). We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006-2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006-2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73%. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU-12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value < 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural extension to improve yields of staple food crops and close the yield gap in Sub-Saharan Africa often entails general recommendations on soil fertility management that are distributed to farmers in a large growing area. Site-specific extension recommendations that are better tailored to the needs of individual farmers and fields, and enabled by digital technologies, could potentially bring about yield and productivity improvements. In this paper, we analyze farmers' preferences for high-input maize production supported by site-specific nutrient management recommendations provided by an ICT-based extension tool that is being developed for extension services in the maize belt of Nigeria. We use a choice experiment to provide ex-ante insights on the adoption potentials of site-specific extension services from the perspective of farmers. We control for attribute non-attendance and account for class as well as scale heterogeneity in preferences using different models, and find robust results. We find that farmers have strong preferences to switch from general to ICT-enabled site-specific soil fertility management recommendations which lend credence to the inclusion of digital technologies in agricultural extension. We find heterogeneity in preferences that is correlated with farmers' resource endowments and access to services. A first group of farmers are strong potential adopters; they are better-off, less sensitive to risk, and are more willing to invest in a high-input maize production system. A second group of farmers are weak potential adopters; they have lower incomes and fewer productive assets, are more sensitive to yield variability, and prefer less capital and labor intensive production techniques. Our empirical findings imply that improving the design of extension tools to enable provision of information on the riskiness of expected outcomes and flexibility in switching between low-risk and high-risk recommendations will help farmers to make better informed decisions, and thereby improve the uptake of extension advice and the efficiency of extension programs.",

    "abstract": "Since COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in the human population, it has had immediate and significant effects on peoples' health and the worldwide economy. In the absence of a vaccine, control of the virus involved limiting its spread through restrictions in the movement of people, goods and services. This has led to unprecedented impacts on labour availability, provision of goods and services, value chains, and markets. Against the backdrop of COVID-19 control measures, this article summarises quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impacts, adaptations, and opportunities to increase the resilience of the agricultural systems in Australia and New Zealand. Using both survey and interview methodologies, we describe the various agri-food systems and the impacts of the COVID-19 control measures across different industries, and discuss the results applying a resilience framework. As essential services, all agricultural activities except for fibre production have been permitted to continue during quarantine periods but have been exposed to the major flow-on effects of movement control. We found that, to June 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 control measures on the agri-food sectors in both Australia and New Zealand have been relatively small and that this has been due to the high levels of resilience in the agricultural systems and the people running them. We consider agri-food systems to be comprised of multiple subsystems with varying vulnerability to external influences. Agri-food systems were resilient to June 2020 at least, and that resilience was achieved via one or more subsystems that were able to compensate for the more vulnerable subsystems. We contrast the resilience of industries that have high plasticity (that can have a flow of material that can safely vary in time) to more rigid industries that are dependent on a steady flow of material with little or no storage. Ultimately both types of industries were resilient, but they achieved that resilience via compensating subsystems. High plasticity industries relied on their production and processing subsystem; rigid industries engaged their institutional subsystem to achieve the same end. The social and cultural subsystem was important across all industries. It is not yet clear if the current resilience mechanisms can persist under the continued onslaught of the virus. We indicate the need to capture longer term effects and analysis during the more sustained effects of the virus and through a recovery period. We anticipate a follow-up study in 2022.",

    "abstract": "Rollout of development interventions using a one-size-fits-all model can achieve economies of scale but neglects to account for variability in farm and farmer characteristics. A data-driven approach to incorporate farmer diversity in scaling strategies may help to achieve greater development impact. However, interpreting the multiplicity of smallholder characteristics is complex, time-consuming, and the ways in which the insights gained can be implemented is poorly understood. Navigating these tensions, we present a farm typology study carried out in collaboration with a large development organisation (the \"scaling partner\") promoting agricultural inputs in Rwanda. This study was conducted late in the scaling pathway, in order to finesse the scaling strategy, rather than to target intervention selection. Drawing on nearly 3000 interviews from 17 districts of the Western, Southern, and Eastern Provinces of Rwanda, the typology differentiates households along two axes: 1. prosperity (a cornerstone of conventional typologies), and 2. adoption of inputs (fertilisers and improved crop varieties). We used an efficient household survey tool, a minimum-variable approach, and concepts from the study of adoption of agricultural innovations. Through an action-research collaboration with the scaling organisation we adapted the methods and the findings to be \"actionable. Approximately two-thirds of the study population were using fertilisers and improved seed to some extent. Along each prosperity stratum, however, there were multiple degrees of adoption, demonstrating the value of including adoption information in typology constructions. Ten farm types were identified, where the key differences along the prosperity axis were land area cultivated and livestock owned, and the key differences along the adoption axis were perceptions of input efficacy, access to training, and education level. We also present a simple decision tree model to assign new households to a farm type. The findings were used in three ways by the scaling organisation: (i) characterisation of the population into discrete groups; (ii) prioritisation, of farm types for engagement, and geographical locations for further investment; and (iii) design of decision support tools or re-design of packages to support technology adoption for specific farm types. The need for field-level validation of the typologies was also stressed by the scaling organisation.",

    "abstract": "The ability of a farm to cope with challenges is often conceptualised as resilience. Although improving resilience of farms is a major policy goal in the European Union, the current state of resilience is often unknown. Previous resilience assessments have been based either on pre-defined indicators or on perceptions. In particular, empirical research of perceived resilience is still limited and usually restricted to one specific resilience capacity, one challenge, or one function. We investigate how European farmers perceive resilience capacities of their farms. Extending beyond previous research, we cover all three resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability, and transformability), consider a broad range of short-term shocks and long-term stresses, and include multiple functions. Furthermore, we analyse farms from diverse farming systems across Europe and investigate whether farms and farmers with similar perceived resilience capacities share characteristics. We address the complex nature of resilience capacities by accounting for multiple scales formulated as analytical steps of a resilience assessment framework. More specifically, these are 'resilience of what' (farms and farming systems), 'resilience to what' (challenges), 'resilience for what purpose' (functions), and 'what enhances resilience' (resilience attributes). These steps guided the development of a survey with farmers across eleven European farming systems. Based on three indices for each farmer indicating perceived robustness, adaptability, and transformability of their farms, we identified two classes of farmers with particularly strong and weak resilience profiles respectively. Using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests, we furthermore compared other parameters collected via the survey across the identified classes. Our data sample outputs two classes of similar size characterised by all three perceived resilience capacities being above (below) regional average. This finding suggests that the perceptions of robustness, adaptability, and transformability are mutually dependent. Furthermore, we found that farmers who perceive their resilience above the regional averages are characterised by lower risk aversion, greater focus on providing public goods, a higher number of implemented risk management strategies, more active involvement in networks, and greater openness to innovation. The revealed links between particular characteristics of farms and farmers and different levels of perceived resilience capacities can support policy-makers in developing more targeted resilience-enhancing strategies, as well as in understanding farmers' responses to challenges. Finally, our results can serve as a basis for further research, e.g., for formulating and testing hypotheses on causal effects between perceived resilience and its components, and on links between perception- and indicator-based resilience assessments.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of labour in explaining the yield gap of cereals at both crop and farm levels on smallholder farms in Southern Ethiopia. A household survey containing detailed information of labour use at crop and farm level of ca. 100 farms in a maize-based system around Hawassa and ca. 100 farms in a wheat-based system around Asella was used for this purpose. Stochastic frontier analysis was combined with the principles of production ecology to decompose maize and wheat yield gaps. Actual maize and wheat yields were on average 1.6 and 2.6 t ha−1, respectively, which correspond to 23 and 26% of the water-limited yield (Yw) of each crop. For both crops, nearly half of the yield gap was attributed to the technology yield gap, indicating sub-optimal crop management to achieve Yw even for the farmers with the highest yields. The efficiency yield gap was ca. 20% of Yw for both crops; it was negatively associated with sowing date and with the proportion of women's labour used for sowing in the case of maize but with the proportion of hired labour used for sowing and weed control in the case of wheat. The resource yield gap was less than 10% of Yw for both crops due to small differences in input use between highest- and lowest-yielding farms. The contribution of capital and farm power availability to crop yields, input use and labour use was analysed at the farm level. Labour calendars showed that crops cultivated in Hawassa were complementary, with peak labour occurring at different times of the year. By contrast, crops cultivated in Asella competed strongly for labour during sowing, hand-weeding and harvesting months, resulting in potential trade-offs at farm level. Oxen ownership was associated with capital availability, but not farm power in Hawassa and with both capital availability and farm power in Asella. Farmers with more oxen applied more nitrogen (N) to maize in Hawassa and cultivated more land in Asella, which is indicative of an intensification pathway in the former and an extensification pathway in the latter. Differences in land:labour ratio and in the types of crops cultivated explained the different strategies used in the two sites. In both sites, although gross margin per unit area increased linearly with increasing crop yield and farm N productivity, gross margin per labour unit increased up to an optimal level of crop yield and farm N productivity after which no further response was observed. This suggests that narrowing the yield gap may not be economically rational in terms of labour productivity. We conclude that labour (and farm power) is not a major determinant of maize yield gaps in Hawassa, but is a major determinant of wheat yield gaps in Asella.",

    "abstract": "Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) seeks to meet three challenges: improve the adaptation capacity of agricultural systems to climate change, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of these systems, and ensure local and global food security. Many CSA assessment methods that consider these three challenges have emerged, but to better assess the environmental resilience of farming systems, other categories of environmental impacts beyond climate change need to be considered. To meet this need, we propose the LCA4CSA method, which was tested in southern Colombia for family farming systems including coffee, cane and small livestock production. This methodological framework is based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and multi-criteria assessment methods. It integrates CSA-related issues through the definition of Principles, Criteria and Indicators, and involves farmers in the assessment of the effects of CSA practices. To reflect the complexity of farming systems, the method proposes a dual level of analysis: the farm and the main cash crop/livestock production system. After creating a typology of the farming systems, the initial situation is compared to the situation after the introduction of a CSA practice. In this case, the practice was the use of compost made from coffee processing residues. The assessment at the crop system level made it possible to quantify the mitigation potential related to the use of compost (between 22 and 41%) by taking into account operations that occur on and upstream of the farm. However, it showed that pollution transfers exist between impact categories, especially between climate change, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication indicators. The assessment made at the farming system level showed that farms with livestock units could further limit their emissions by modifying the feeding of animals due to the large quantities of imported cereals. The mitigation potential of compost was only 3% for these farms. This article demonstrates the merits of using life cycle thinking that can be used to inform stakeholder discussions concerning the implementation of CSA practices and more sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Intercropping entails the concurrent production of two or more crop species in the same field. This traditional farming method generally results in a highly efficient use of land, but whether it also contributes to a higher technical efficiency remains unclear. Technical efficiency refers to the efficiency with which a given set of natural resources and other inputs can be used to produce crops. In this study, we examined the contribution of maize-based relay-strip intercropping to the technical efficiency of smallholder farming in northwest China. Data on the inputs and crop production of 231 farms were collected for the 2013 agricultural season using a farm survey held in Gaotai County, Gansu Province, China. Controlling for other factors, we found that the technical efficiency scores of these farms were positively affected by the proportion of land assigned to intercropping. This finding indicates that the potential negative effects of intercropping on the use efficiency of labour and other resources are more than offset by its higher land-use efficiency when compared with monocropping.",

    "abstract": "Plot sizes and farm-plot distances affect the economic performance of agricultural production. Their economic effects likely differ between conventional and organic farming systems due to major differences in crop production programs. Our paper quantifies these effects based on big data on resource requirements of field operations, summarized by regression models. Combined with detailed case study information obtained through interviews, we assess plot size and farm-plot distance effects for three case study farms which recently converted to organic farming. Our results show for both farming systems, as expected, that larger plot sizes reduce labor requirements and costs associated with crop production while larger farm-plot distances increase them. At same plot sizes and farm-plot distances organic farms face lower costs in crop production and, at given market prices, higher profits. Cost savings from larger plot sizes are, however, higher in conventional farming systems as are cost increases from growing farm-plot distances. This implies that economic benefits of conversion are higher for farms managing smaller plots farther away from the farm. Land fragmentation might hence favor switching to organic production and motivate regionally differentiated subsidy rates.",

    "abstract": "Participatory modeling approaches provide opportunities for collective action responding to challenges of community resource limitations. In the context of climate change, challenges arise from the potential limitations of water availability and resulting conflicts within the agricultural sector. Northeast Lower Saxony is the region with the highest irrigation intensity in Germany due to the sandy soils with low water holding capacity, the cultivation of crops with high water demand, and a negative climatic water balance during the summer months. Water resources will become more limited as a consequence of climate change. Simultaneously, the irrigation demand will most likely increase due to intensified crop cultivation. Responding to these challenges, we developed a novel method to identify leverage points for effective climate change adaptation measures. We applied this method to analyze opportunities for climate change adaptation within the agricultural sector in Northeast Lower Saxony. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of stakeholders to implement adaptation measures that correspond to the identified leverage points on different time scales. Our leverage point analysis is based on a qualitative system dynamics model that was developed within a participatory modeling framework. We analyzed parameters, feedback loops, and typical system archetypes within the model. Leverage points that were related to the design and the intent of the model emerged during the iterative model building process. Subsequently, we introduced a rating system to evaluate the potential of each leverage point to be successful as a climate change adaptation measure. We provide a point-by-point analysis of the potential of key stakeholders to implement adaptation measures. The leverage points analysis was applied to the case study of Northeast Lower Saxony. It revealed that collective action is needed to cope with these challenges. Decision-makers should provide financial incentives to increase water retention in the region. Farmers will have to improve irrigation efficiency and technology for crop production. Increased societal awareness of climate change-related water shortages has the potential to direct the system towards more sustainable water use and consumption patterns. Our novel and structured approach is an attempt to analyze complex socio-economic systems. It supports mediating water resource conflicts between various stakeholders to facilitate collective action for adaptive planning.",

    "abstract": "Innovation based on information and communication technology (ICT) plays an increasingly important role in agricultural research-for-development efforts. It has been recognized, however, that the weak adoption and low impact of many ICT-for-agriculture (ICT4Ag) efforts are partly due to poor design. Often, design was driven more by technological feasibility than by a thorough analysis of the target group's needs and capacities. For more user-centered ICT4Ag development, there is now growing interest in the use of systematic, participatory design methodologies. Numerous methodologies for participatory design exist, but applying any of them in smallholder farming context can create specific challenges that digital development researchers need to deal with. This article aims to support future digital development efforts by contributing practical insights to recent discussions on the use of participatory design methodologies for ICT4Ag development. We present lessons learned from practical experiences within participatory design projects that developed ICT4Ag solutions in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Based on these experiences and supported by literature, we describe common challenges and limitations that digital designers may face in practice, and discuss possible opportunities for dealing with them. The outcomes of digital design projects within research-for-development efforts can be affected by tensions between design ideals and project realities. These tensions may relate to, among others, mismatching expectations among project stakeholders, top-down hierarchies at design partners, insufficient attention to the wider digital ecosystem, and disincentives to re-use ideas and software. Depending on project context, these challenges may need to be addressed by researchers during planning and implementation of digital design projects. The insights in this article may support agricultural development researchers in facilitating more effective participatory design processes. Even though good design is not the only precondition for a successful ICT4Ag service, this can help create more meaningful digital innovation for agricultural development.",

    "abstract": "Despite a wealth of analytical knowledge on factors and processes that operate to slow down or impede sustainability transitions in various sectors of society, design-oriented researchers face a lack of guidance on the 'how to' question for developing knowledge to support sustainability changes. From 2007, we crafted co-innovation as an approach for governance and management of change-oriented projects, combining three domains; a complex adaptive systems perspective, a social learning setting, and dynamic monitoring and evaluation. This paper sets out to describe the co-innovation approach and draw lessons from its application in projects on ecological intensification in Uruguay and the European Union. We used an analytical framework for evaluating sustainability transition experiments, which considers project features that provide insights into the contribution to sustainability transformations by project outputs, outcomes, processes and inputs, and their interactions. Empirical information on 6 cases from 3 projects was collected through in-depth interviews with former project staff, group discussion, and project documentation. This enabled a reflexive evaluation of co-innovation. Outputs showed substantial variation among the cases despite a similar approach to project governance and management. More significant contributions to sustainability transitions were associated with in-depth project preparation, a focus at the farm-level instead of the crop or field level, connections during the project's lifetime with regional innovation system actors, and frequent facilitated interactions among project actors to reflect on results, wider system implications, and project direction. We discuss the results in relation to the three domains of co-innovation. To enhance the role of projects in destabilizing currently unsustainable systems we highlight: reconsidering the role of projects as a business model; stimulating institutional learning from previous change-oriented projects; and making funding more adaptive to evolving project needs. With most of the budget for agricultural research-for-change spent through projects, how projects are conducted is a critical determinant of the rate of sustainability transitions. Effective disruption of unsustainable practices through project interventions requires rethinking linear cause-effect relations to include project governance and management approaches based on complex adaptive systems thinking, social learning settings, and monitoring geared to adaptation and learning.",

In this perspective, we survey the current state of circularity of U.S. grain production, and discuss how we can transform the systems into more circular systems. Specifically, we lay out a vision of circular grain production enabled by novel digital, mechanical, and biological technologies that allow closing loops of nutrient and energy flows within the farm, through the optimization of land-use choices and crop management. We also examine market- and policy-based mechanisms that could incentivize the widespread adoption of these key technologies.",

    "abstract": "Crop diversification has been proposed as a promising strategy for transitioning towards sustainable agricultural systems by leveraging biological processes and controls present in naturally biodiverse ecosystems. Strip cropping, a form of intercropping where two or more crops are grown adjacent to one another in long and narrow multi-row strips, has been shown to deliver a greater range of ecosystem services compared to sole crop references due to increased interspecific crop interactions, spatio-temporal niche differentiation, and higher in-field habitat diversity. The possibility to adjust the strip width to the working width of farmers' existing machines gives strip cropping of cash crops an important implementation advantage over other intercropping practices. Systematic exploration and evaluation of spatial plans for strip cropping systems, however, is constrained by the lack of spatially-explicit design approaches. Here we present a framework to support systematic exploration of spatio-temporal strip cropping configurations for a given farm context and set of objectives. The framework comprises six steps: 1) Diagnosis of the current farm situation; 2) Specification of strip cropping system attributes; 3) Temporal strip cropping planning; 4) Spatio-temporal strip cropping planning; 5) Spatio-temporal strip cropping configuration assessment; 6) Strip cropping configuration selection and visualization. We combine two software applications: ROTAT to generate crop rotations and the novel RotaStrip to systematically explore spatio-temporal configurations based on the rotations generated by ROTAT. We illustrate the framework with a case study from the Netherlands using gross margin, habitat score, and spatial crop compatibility score as indicators. 150 crop rotations were generated. When 6 additional crops were included this was increased to 51,371, and the maximum values of the three indicator scores were also improved. Using the thirteen candidate crops to generate spatio-temporal configurations, we identified 16 Pareto-optimal and 78 anti-optimal configurations, from which the highest and lowest performing configurations were selected. The two contrasting configurations scored 7254 and 6658 €.ha−1.yr−1 for gross margin, 0.88 and 0.75 for habitat score, and 98 and− 58 for crop compatibility score, respectively, illustrating the value of consideration of the spatial aspects. Bridging the current knowledge gaps regarding what constitute good crop combinations, and strengthening the evidence underpinning the evaluation of ecosystem service delivery on the basis of spatial configuration, would further improve the quality of the generated strip cropping plans. The framework presented and illustrated in this study provides a basis for systematic spatio-temporal strip cropping systems design and implementation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on yield gap analysis for rice in Southeast Asia revealed different levels of intensification across the main 'rice bowls' in the region. Identifying the key crop management and biophysical drivers of rice yield gaps across different 'rice bowls' provides opportunities for comparative analyses, which are crucial to better understand the scope to narrow yield gaps and increase resource-use efficiencies across the region. The objective of this study was to decompose rice yield gaps into their efficiency, resource, and technology components and to map the scope to sustainably increase rice production across four lowland irrigated rice areas in Southeast Asia through improved crop management. A novel framework for yield gap decomposition accounting for the main genotype, management, and environmental factors explaining crop yield in intensive rice irrigated systems was developed. A combination of crop simulation modelling at field-level and stochastic frontier analysis was applied to household survey data to identify the drivers of yield variability and to disentangle efficiency, resource, and technology yield gaps, including decomposing the latter into its sowing date and genotype components. The yield gap was greatest in Bago, Myanmar (75% of Yp), intermediate in Yogyakarta, Indonesia (57% of Yp) and in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand (47% of Yp), and lowest in Can Tho, Vietnam (44% of Yp). The yield gap in Myanmar was largely attributed to the resource yield gap, reflecting a large scope to sustainably intensify rice production through increases in fertilizer use and proper weed control (i.e., more output with more inputs). In Vietnam, the yield gap was mostly attributed to the technology yield gap and to resource and efficiency yield gaps in the dry season and wet season, respectively. Yet, sustainability aspects associated with inefficient use of fertilizer and low profitability from high input levels should also be considered alongside precision agriculture technologies for site-specific management (i.e., more output with the same or less inputs). The same is true in Thailand, where the yield gap was equally explained by the technology, resource, and efficiency yield gaps. The yield gap in Indonesia was mostly attributed to efficiency and technology yield gaps and yield response curves to N based on farmer field data in this site suggest it is possible to reduce its use while increasing rice yield (i.e., more output with less inputs). This study provides a novel approach to decomposing rice yield gaps in Southeast Asia's main rice producing areas. By breaking down the yield gap into different components, context-specific opportunities to narrow yield gaps were identified to target sustainable intensification of rice production in the region.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cocoa agroforestry systems differ in the diversity of shade tree species composition. Though cocoa benefits from shade, there is a lack of species-specific information on shade trees that enhance soil fertility and yield. OBJECTIVE: We examined how soil characteristics and cocoa yield were affected by eight commonly retained forest tree species, compared with unshaded control plots over a 3-year period. METHODS: Using 74 circular plots from 10 cocoa farms in the Western region of Ghana, we sampled soils from two random points within each plot. Soil nutrients at the beginning and end of the study were analyzed, and yield was expressed as number of harvested pods and dry weight of beans per hectare. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Levels of soil K and Ca were below recommended values. Although soil available phosphorus (P) was higher in control plots than under shade trees, yield around shade trees were higher than on unshaded plots. Cocoa yield differences between shade tree species and control plots were significant only in the major crop season, but not in the minor crop season. Cocoa yields under Cedrela odorata, Khaya ivorensis, Terminalia superba and Milicia excelsa were significantly higher than on control plots. Hence, the inclusion of specific shade tree species in cocoa agroforestry systems is important to maintain high yields in cocoa systems with low inputs. SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge, this study presents one of the first attempt to assess the impacts of specific shade tree species on soil characteristics and cocoa yield.",

    "abstract": "It is still an open question how to assess the contribution of digitalisation in agriculture to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and how digitalisation then can be done in a responsible way. A socio-cyber-physical system (SCPS) concept can help this analysis, but little experience exists with its operationalisation and application, and its integration with the Responsible Research and Innovation approach. To address this gap, this paper has a twofold purpose: a) operationalise the SCPS concept within an integrated assessment framework adaptable to multiple levels of analysis, contexts, and purposes (e.g. ex-ante, ongoing, ex post evaluation) to shed light on impacts of digitalisation in relation to SCPS entities, relationships, and activities; b) apply the designed framework in 21 multi-stakeholder platforms (Living Labs), which were established to explore needs and expectations in specific subjects relevant for European agriculture, forestry and rural areas. Impacts were assessed through interviews (158 respondents), focus groups (378 participants), online surveys (273 respondents), and other secondary data. The findings indicate that the SCPS framework enables elucidating relationships between digital and broader sustainable development goals and needs, and can sharpen earlier assessments, going beyond a pessimistic or optimistic dichotomy associated to digitalisation by specifying effects and trade-offs in terms of enabling, disenabling, boosting and depleting impacts of digital agriculture. However, the framework being comprehensive and open to emerging socio-cyber-physical interactions, makes that Livings Labs doing participatory impact assessments struggled with the complexity and multiple dimensions of the topic. The paper provides both conceptual and operational knowledge to set up impact evaluations of responsible digitalisation in agriculture and outline concepts that can help anticipating the consequences and trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Global cocoa production is largely concentrated in West Africa where over 70% of cocoa is produced. Here, cocoa farming is largely a rain-fed, low-input system with low average yields, which are expected to decline with climate change. With increasing demand, there is a need to evaluate opportunities to increase production whilst avoiding deforestation and expansion to croplands. Thus, it is important to know how much additional cocoa can be produced on existing farmland, and what factors determine this potential for increased yield. The objective was to quantify the cocoa yield gap in Ghana and identify the factors that can contribute to narrowing the gap. We calculated the cocoa yield gap as the difference between potential yield (i. water-limited potential(Yw) quantified using a crop model, ii. attainable yield in high-input systems(YE), iii. attainable yield in low-input systems(YF)) and actual farmer yield. Both absolute and relative yield gaps were calculated. We then related each yield gap (absolute & relative) as a function of environment and management variables using mixed-effects models. There were considerable yield gaps on all cocoa farms. Maximum water-limited yield gaps (YGW) were very large with a mean absolute gap of 4577 kg/ha representing 86% of Yw. Attainable yield gap in high-input (YGE) was lower with mean absolute gap of 1930 kg/ha representing 73% of YE. The yield gap in low-input (YGF) was even lower with mean absolute gap of 469 kg/ha representing 42% of YF. Mixed-effects models showed that, absolute YGW were larger at sites with higher precipitation in the minor wet and minimum temperature in the minor dry season explaining 22% of the variability in YGW. These same factors and cocoa planting density explained 28% of variability in absolute YGE. Regardless of climate, absolute YGF and relative YGW, YGE and YGF were reduced by increasing cocoa planting density and application of fungicide against black pod. The models explained 25% of the variability in absolute YGF, and 33%, 33% and 25% in relative YGW, YGE and YGF respectively. In conclusion, climate determined absolute YGW in Ghana whilst absolute YGE were determined by both climate and management. In contrast, absolute YGF and relative YGW, YGE and YGF can be reduced by agronomic management practices. Our study is one of the first to quantify cocoa yield gaps in West Africa and shows that these can be closed by improved agronomic practices.",

    "abstract": "Declining rainfall with increasing variability, increasing temperature extremes, and declining soil fertility are threatening crop production and ultimately food security in the rainfed Mediterranean environment in Morocco. Conservation agriculture (CA) practices such as reduced tillage, soil cover, and appropriate crop rotation are recognized as a set of adaptive agricultural systems in such climate-sensitive regions. Systematic evaluation of agronomic, economic, and soil fertility indicators with medium-and long-term adoption of CA in different crop rotations in such variable climatic conditions is needed to drive wider adoption of CA in the region. The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate agronomic, economic, and soil fertility indicators under CA and conventional tillage (CT) using field experimentation (medium-term) and simulation modeling (long-term) for a clay soil of a rainfed Mediterranean environment. Methodologies included the following: 1) Field experimentation for 5 years (2015–2019), comparing CA and CT in four major food crops: wheat, barley, lentil, and chickpea, conducted in Merchouch, Morocco. The objective was to determine the effect of CA on crop productivity, yield stability, profitability, precipitation use efficiency, and soil fertility indicators of individual crops and cropping systems. (2) Dynamic simulation modeling to understand the long-term effect of adopting CA and CT under cereal–legume and cereal–cereal rotation systems. Using 5 years of experimental data, we calibrated and validated a Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model for four crops; and ran the model for 36 years for two major rotations. Across the five contrasting rainfall years, in comparison to CT, CA had greater yield stability and increased wheat grain yield by 43%, barley by 8%, lentil by 11%, and chickpea by 19%. In 5 years of cereal-legume rotation cycle, CA resulted in increased system yield (by 20%), total benefits (by 40%), precipitation use efficiency (by 13%), and available soil moisture (by14%) with production cost reduced by 14.5%. The CA system had higher soil organic matter (+7%), available phosphorus (+3%), and exchangeable potassium (+15%) than in CT, although all differences were non-significant. Our field experiment and long-term simulation results suggest that CA adoption improves a range of agronomic and economic, and soil fertility indicators compared to CT in the clay soil of a rainfed Mediterranean environment. The outcomes of this experimental and simulation study on the multiple benefits of CA provide evidence for extensionists, policymakers, and farmers to drive its wider adoption in Morocco and similar production environments.",

However, such digital transformation brings with it significant socio-ethical challenges. Responsible innovation provides insights and approaches to help guide digital transformation in socially beneficial and equitable directions. Drawing on the authors' involvement in digital agriculture programmes in two public research organisations in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, we reflect on our collective experiences and consider who is responsible for being responsible and how public research organisations can enable more responsible digital agriculture research and innovation programmes. This short communication is informed by a synthesis of: (i) insights from our research on socio-technical dimensions of digital agriculture programmes; (ii) critical reflections as social scientists participating in these programmes; and (iii) workshop synthesis that draws out reflections from wider programme participants about responsible innovation, developed through four collaborative workshops held virtually between May and August 2020. Our experiences show that responsible innovation in Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand public digital agriculture research and development so far tends to be only partially operationalised, with a mismatch between aspirations, rhetoric, and practice. Successful responsible innovation requires systemic and organisational changes to research and development practices across multiple levels to enable and enhance the 'response-ability' of project teams, including changes to the performance measures and reward mechanisms that encourage more responsible research and development outcomes. Our synthesis and reflections raise broader questions about the productively disruptive potential of responsible innovation. By challenging techno-centric framings of digital agriculture and encouraging more socially responsible processes and outcomes, this 'disruption' by responsible innovation can ultimately add value to digital agriculture research and development programmes and innovation systems.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural intensification is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Biodiversity conservation and restoration generally involve human intervention. In comparison, rewilding, a radically different approach to address the erosion of biodiversity, aims to increase the ability of ecological processes to act with little or no human intervention, and thus to enhance biodiversity and the supply of ecosystem services. Rewilding, including that of agricultural systems, has been examined from ecological and social perspectives but rarely from an agricultural perspective. In this review of the literature and case studies, we (i) analyse whether and how rewilding of agricultural systems, particularly livestock systems, can help conserve and restore biodiversity and offer new prospects, and (ii) identify research questions about rewilding of agricultural systems. We researched literature in the Web of Science Core Collection that focussed on rewilding, agriculture, and interactions between them. We also identified agricultural rewilding projects established for at least five years in the United Kingdom (UK) to analyse their approaches and characteristics. Agricultural rewilding is an emerging form of land use that we conceptually position on a gradient between agroecology and rewilding. It combines restoration of ecological processes with some degree of agricultural production, most often of herbivores. A selection of 11 agricultural rewilding projects in the UK had areas of 121–4402 ha. The projects targeted 48 key species/breeds, 24 of which were ecosystem engineers: 19 grazers, four pig breeds and Eurasian beavers. The main actions to enhance rewilding were extensive grazing and habitat restoration. The main economic activities were meat or animal sales, tourism and education programmes. Agricultural rewilding may provide a multifunctional model to which livestock systems with herbivores may transition to respond better to environmental concerns. However, because it may lack economic viability and conflict with local culture and traditions, government policies may be needed to encourage more farmers to adopt it. Agricultural rewilding offers new prospects for livestock systems with herbivores. We identified key research questions about its relation to agroecology and rewilding, conditions necessary to implement it, its potential for plant production and its value for farmers. In addition, the forms it can take remain to be explored, and the potential influence of these forms on biodiversity, ecosystem services and environmental impacts needs to be characterised. Exploring the forms that agricultural rewilding may take requires close collaboration among ecologists, animal scientists, agronomists, and social scientists.",

    "abstract": "Mixed farming and agroforestry systems (MiFAS) are widely proposed to deal with ecological, economic, and social challenges that are associated with specialised farming systems. However, little is known about how MiFAS are integrated in food value chains and how value creation in MiFAS is rewarded by value chain actors. We review the broad literature on MiFAS (80 papers) with a particular focus on implications for food value chains. We use thematic analysis to code existing evidence and categorise these codes into four major themes: MiFAS value creation, Impacts of the farming environment on value creation, Ecosystem service valuation, and Supply & value chain integration. From here, we produce meta-narratives to summarise the literature within each theme. In a second step, we use these literature insights to develop possible value chain configurations that operationalise MiFAS in food value chains. We find that: a) integrating farming enterprises tends to improve yields and land-use efficiency and can reduce variable costs; b) MiFAS seem to face significant challenges with respect to fixed costs, such as of capital investments, and of labour; c) high opportunity costs associated with MiFAS can be a drawback for farms seeking to become more integrated as limited knowledge and the time to establish profitable MiFAS can deter adoption; d) sources of value creation within MiFAS stem from its ability to reduce variable costs as well as maintain or raise inputs, primarily by improving the efficiency of resources such as nutrients and land; and e) inter-farmer partnerships and collaboration have the potential to shorten MiFAS supply chains and extend value capture for farmers by allowing them greater ownership of value created. In total, insights into value chain implications of MiFAS are scarce. Therefore, our research delivers important implications for future research on MiFAS that should focus more on value chain implications of this emerging food production system.",

    "abstract": "To address sustainability challenges in agriculture, private and multi-stakeholder initiatives increasingly use sustainability indicators to monitor the sustainability impact of farms. These indicators can be part of standards for certification or assessment tools to measure farm performance. While these initiatives play an important role in navigating the sustainability transition, insight in how these governance initiatives operationalize sustainability in crop farming is lacking. This paper examines how private and multi-stakeholder governance initiatives, which increasingly regulate the sustainability of a sizeable portion of agriculture globally, operationalize the concept of sustainability. It provides understanding into which sustainability themes are commonly included in sustainability initiatives, and those that are not, which can give insight into the direction these initiatives are steering crop production worldwide. We developed an overview of governance initiatives using databases and existing research on sustainable agriculture initiatives. Documentation about these initiatives was gathered and used to systematically review descriptive and institutional characteristics of the 29 sustainability assessment and standard initiatives. Moreover, we analyzed the kinds of indicators (i.e., performance, practice, and target) and the themes that are prioritized in the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability. The analysis shows that the 29 initiatives are very diverse in their characteristics. While some specifically focus on one crop or country, others operate across production chains and at a global scale. Within specific sectors or countries, certain standards are quite influential, for instance, the Better Cotton Initiative covers 22% of global cotton production, while in Ireland, 70% of horticulture farmers are Origin Green certified. Globally, 2% of the crop land is certified under one of the 14 standards that reported land use. Our analysis of sustainability themes show an imbalance across environmental, social, an economic sustainability, with environmental sustainability being prioritized. In particular, social themes such as quality of life, food sovereignty and fair trading practices were less often included (38, 24 and 21% respectively). Sustainability standard and assessment initiatives govern a substantial and growing portion of global cropland. They play a central role in determining what is considered sustainable and thereby influence which farming practices are applied worldwide. The impact of these initiatives is likely to continue to grow as sustainability assessments and standards become more widely adopted. In examining a large sample of standard and assessment initiatives, this study presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of sustainability indicators for crop farming globally.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices is critical for future ecological, food security, and farmer livelihood goals. Traditionally, the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices is treated as a binary decision, which simplifies the known complexity around behavior change. Furthermore, this approach ignores farmers that have previously utilized a practice, the extent to which a farmer adopts a practice across their farm, as well as the complexity of different sustainable agriculture practices, which may evolve over time. This analysis explores the complexity of farmer adoption of best management practices by developing a framework that considers adoption across multiple components and beyond a simple outcome. We develop a new framework for the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices that proposes four key elements: Entirety, variability, sophistication, and longevity. We incorporate this framework into a latent class analysis, using data from a nationwide survey of U.S. row crop farmers' focused on cover crop adoption. We identify five types of adopters, including non-adopters, previous adopters, conservative new adopters, innovative new adopters, and early adopters. This analysis challenges existing innovation theories, which typically indicate that early adopters are the primary innovators within an innovation system. Instead, we identify a class of new farmer adopters that have the highest adoption of innovative, sophisticated practices. Utilizing multinomial logit models, we further examine the factors that influence farmers' adoption classification. We find self-efficacy, perceived production risks, social-environmental altruism, communication and networking, other conservation practice use, diversity of cash crops, livestock operations and farming size have various effects on farmers' different adoption types. The framework and its application for cover crop adoption provide a structured opportunity to further our understanding of sustainable agriculture practice adoption. Given our identification of five types of adopters, and their unique needs, interests, and propensity to adoption of varying levels, these results provide practical implications for successful farmer learning and extension services. In particular, we highlight that adoption may have multiple forms that should be considered in policy development and technical assistance, including not only \"new\" adoption, but also re-adoption, as well as continued and increasingly complex adoption of sustainable agriculture practices.",

    "abstract": "The assimilation of Remote Sensing (RS) data into crop models improves the accuracy of yield predictions by considering crop growth dynamics and their spatial heterogeneity due to the different management practices and environmental conditions. This study proposes a new method for performing sub-regional yield predictions (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS-3 level) using RS time series data and crop models. The primary objective was to release a procedure whereby the heterogeneity of the agricultural landscape (i.e. the agrophenotypes) observed from RS is used to drive crop model calibration. Fine-resolution barley and maize distribution maps (100 m) and related crop calendars have been used to derive the \"where\" and \"when\" of the 8-day MODIS NDVI time series data, located in Apulia, Tuscany, and Veneto in 2018–2019. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering have been applied to NDVI seasonal profiles to identify the agrophenotypes, which have been used to derive crop growth and leaf area index dynamics. These data served as the reference to optimize the most relevant parameters of the WOFOST_GT model, using gridded weather data as input (0.25° resolution, Copernicus ERA5). Parameter distributions from multiple automatic calibrations have been sampled to characterize the agricultural heterogeneity within 22 NUTS-3 administrative units. Yield statistics from the Italian National Institute of Statistics have been used as reference data to test the accuracy of the yield simulation by the crop model WOFOST_GT. The agrophenotypes reflected the wide north-south latitudinal gradient experienced in Italy by the two crops, leading to a gap of 15–30 days in barley and maize flowering and harvest dates across the study area. Average Nast-Sutcliffe modelling efficiency in reproducing LAI dynamics from RS (0.6) and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) in predicting yield data (12.1% for barley, 3.7% for maize) in hindcast simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. The average RRMSE was reduced by 32.7% (barley) and 8.5% (maize) compared to baseline, decreasing by 0.7–1 Mg ha−1 absolute yield errors on both crops. The inclusion of local agrophenotypes in the yield prediction workflow reduced errors in yield prediction compared to unsupervised simulations at NUTS-3 level. The script for agrophenotypes extraction and the model parameter sets are released to the scientific community, to foster improvements and further applications to other crops, ecoclimatic regions, satellite sensors and spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural intensification contributes to global food security and well-being by supplying the food demand of a growing human population. However, ongoing land-use change and intensification seriously affect the abundance, diversity and distribution of species, besides many other impacts, thereby threatening the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. Despite the accumulating evidence that the current agricultural model is unsustainable, we are far from understanding the consequences of functional diversity loss for functioning and ecosystem service supply and the potential long-term threats to food security and human well-being. In this review, we propose a conceptual framework to understand the relationships between functional diversity and human well-being that also considers agroecosystem health. To this end, we identify the most commonly assumed relationships linking functional diversity to regulating and provisioning agroecosystem services and their importance for human well-being, emphasising the most serious knowledge gaps in the individual pathways of the conceptual framework. A consortium formed by an international panel of experts from different disciplines including functional diversity, ecosystem services and human health compiled 275 articles. Members of the consortium proposed literature to exemplify each specific aspect of the conceptual framework in the text, in accordance with his/her field of expertise. The guideline for all experts was to focus mostly in current literature (38% of the references are from the last 5 years and 66% from the last decade), with special interest in reviews and synthesis articles (42% of the references), as well as meta-analyses and global studies (10% of the references). The factors that influence agroecosystem health are extremely complex, involving both services and disservices related to land-use management and environmental conditions. The global human population needs sustainable and resilient agroecosystems and a concerted effort is needed to fundamentally redesign agricultural practices to feed the growing human population without further jeopardising the quality of life for future generations. We highlight the potential effects of land-use change and ecological intensification on the functional diversity of plant and animal communities, and the resulting consequences for ecosystem services and ultimately human health. The resulting conceptual model is developed for researchers as well as policy makers highlighting the need for a holistic approach to understand diversity impacts on human well-being. Finally, we document a major knowledge gap due to the lack of any studies focusing on the full pathway from diversity to human well-being.",

    "abstract": "Palm oil production is a major source of income for millions of smallholders in Indonesia. However, actual yield remains low in relation to the attainable yield. While emphasis has been given to planting material as a factor explaining low yield in smallholder fields, the role of agronomic management has received less attention. We assessed the role of agronomic management in explaining low oil palm productivity in independent smallholder fields in Indonesia. We quantified yield gaps and their causes using data on fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield and management practices collected over two years across 977 fields. The yield gap was estimated for each field as the difference between actual and attainable yield. The latter was estimated using a crop model, local weather and field-specific soil and palm age. Statistical techniques were used to identify factors explaining yield gaps. Average yield represented 42% of the attainable yield, with largest yield gaps occurring in young plantations. Our analyses identified agronomic practices explaining yield gaps, including nutrient management, harvest interval, weed control, and pruning. Improved agronomic management can help smallholders increase yield and profit on existing plantations. There is an opportunity to produce more palm oil on current plantation area via better agronomy, generating a positive economic impact at local to national levels, while reducing pressure to clear new land for cultivation. Research & extension programs should be re-oriented to give more emphasis to agronomic management.",

    "abstract": "Cocoa is an important commodity crop and source of income for millions of small-holder farmers. Nonetheless, questions on cocoa tree functioning, best management practices and climate change responses remain. Modelling is a powerful tool to address these questions, complementing experimental work that is expensive and time consuming due to the long productive cycle of the cocoa system. However, compared to other crops, cocoa modelling has not received as much attention. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed existing cocoa models and identified the main gaps in the literature and possible strategies to advance models of cocoa production. We first classified relevant research questions in cocoa production along three main axes (fundamental-applied, spatial organization, prediction horizon) and aligned modelling approaches along these. We then reviewed six published cocoa models using these axes as framework. This comparison revealed several modelling gaps for which we provide an overview of data availability for future model development. (i) Several plant processes (i.e., water stress responses, respiration, climate change responses, nutrient effects and phenology) are either missing from existing cocoa models or are simulated based on general plant physiological knowledge rather than cocoa-specific knowledge. (ii) The only currently existing 3D model of cocoa architecture has very limited scope and does not include physiological processes. (iii) There are no model-based decision support tools available for supporting the main management practices such as irrigation, fertilization and pruning. (iv) Data for model calibration and validation are often scarce. We conclude that data availability for model design, calibration and validation is currently the main bottleneck for further development of cocoa models. Extensive cooperation within the cocoa research community and a large network of long-term experiments under different climatic and management conditions are required to close the identified modelling gaps.",

    "abstract": "Chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is one of the most economically and agriculturally important, and relatively nutrient-dense, vegetables that has, to date, received little attention in model studies relevant to dry matter production and nutrient-uptake predictions. There is an urgent need for models to analyse the potential impacts of climate change, as well as responsive adaptation options, while simultaneously optimising productivity against fertilizer use to reduce nutrient pollution. We adapted the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop growth simulation model for chili pepper (WOFOST-Chili) to quantify dry matter production as a function of fertilizer management, climate, and soil conditions. We used 2021 field trial data under optimal growing conditions in southwestern China to parameterise and calibrate WOFOST-Chili. The model was tested under no-fertilizer conditions and further validated with data from 2019 and 2020. In addition, a sensitivity analysis over the three consecutive years was performed. Overall, the developed WOFOST-Chili model shows good simulations of chili growth dynamics in response to nitrogen (N) fertilization, both on biomass assimilation (rRMSE = 0.07 for total aboveground production; rRMSE = 0.06 for fruit dry weight) and nutrient uptake (rRMSE = 0.46 for leaf N amount; rRMSE = 0.29 for fruit N amount). Additionally, model robustness is increased by the sensitivity analysis of crop initialisation (e.g., biomass and leaf area index at transplanting) and climate-dependent parameters (e.g., temperature sums determining development rate and light use efficiency determining productivity), with the resulting wider simulation range covering more observations. This good performance is only limited by a weaker leaf area index (LAI) simulation (rRMSE = 0.76), which is partially attributed measurement limitations (e.g., equipment, weather conditions and labour/time constraints). Model validation confirms good performance under potential conditions, which is slightly reduced under nutrient-limited conditions. These findings improve our understanding of yield-nutrient interactions of chili pepper. They provide insight on expanding the application of crop models originally designed for cereals to non-Gramineae vegetables, while calling for future improvement of model accuracy under different fertilizer application strategies.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus that agriculture, forestry, and livestock integration (agroforestry systems) could assist South Asia in combating food insecurity by expediting the transition towards sustainability. However, there is a dearth of a comprehensive synthesis of evidence demonstrating the actual relevance of this nexus to agroecological development and farmers' food security in South Asia—the majority of whom are smallholders with limited assets. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potentiality of the South Asian agroforestry systems- as a viable agroecological approach for ensuring farmers' food security: food availability, access, utilization, and stability. A systematic literature review was conducted following the guidelines provided by the \"Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses\" (PRISMA) to achieve the study objective. The Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection databases were used, along with Google Scholar as an additional database, to gather relevant articles for the review. Among the 95 studies reviewed, only nine explicitly focused on food security, and none of them examined all four dimensions of food security simultaneously. Moreover, the skewed distribution of studies towards the Himalayan belt and a lack of quantitative measurement make it challenging to determine the extent to which agroforestry improved farmers' food security. However, the review identified several pathways, such as diversification of food options (n = 53), fodder supply (n = 57), income increase (n = 73) and diversification (n = 64), fuel wood supply (n = 59), fulfillment of medicinal needs (n = 30), and soil enrichment (n = 36), through which the integration of agriculture, forestry, and livestock could contribute to the food security. However, some studies found certain drawbacks, such as a decrease in agricultural crop yield (n = 29), breeding of pests and diseases (n = 10), and a longer gestation period (n = 9), which could threaten food and livelihood security. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that appropriate species selection and effective management practices can help mitigate these negative impacts. The findings of this study will aid in the effective policy formulation to ensure food security by providing decision-makers and last-mile institutions with information on the benefits and drawbacks of the agricultural, forestry, and livestock nexus. Furthermore, the review findings would allow for cross-temporal and cross-spatial comparisons. Future research would benefit from the review approach used in this work as well as the identified research gaps.",

    "abstract": "Climate models project higher temperatures and a substantial net water deficit during the summer months over Germany until the end of the 21st century. The agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to changing weather and climate conditions. In this study, we examine the role of irrigation for potato yields as a climate change adaptation measure in Northeast Lower Saxony (Germany). The region represents the largest irrigated area in Germany and is one of the main growing areas of potatoes. We develop a statistical multivariate regression model to investigate whether regional climate and irrigation data at the monthly and county level are suitable to describe potato yield variability from 1978 to 2018. Irrigation is estimated based on the climatic water balance and crop water demand. These estimates are calibrated against irrigation data from local agencies to account for realistic monthly water withdrawals. We analyze future yield changes based on climate model projections for the 21st century and different irrigation scenarios. We find that the potato yield will decrease significantly by 18% on average until 2050 with climate projection uncertainty of ±6.4% under the high emission scenario RCP 8.5 and without irrigation. Irrigation at current levels could compensate for about 54% of these yield losses. Doubling the amount of irrigation minimizes yield losses by as much as 80%. Under the low (middle) emission scenario RCP 2.6 (RCP 4.5), potato yield are projected to decrease moderately by 4.5% ± 3.4% (5.4% ± 2.8%) with irrigation at current levels. We show that the yield losses mainly originate from higher temperatures during the summer. Our analysis indicates that the capacity of irrigation to minimize yield losses is limited. Strengthening climate change mitigation efforts may be more effective in preventing yield losses. However, the effect of elevated CO2 might buffer the high yield losses, especially in RCP 8.5. The studies supports farmers and decision makers in assessing future risks in potato yields. It can guide policymakers in allocating economic resources to cope with climate change.",

    "abstract": "Digital innovations can enhance the participation of often-marginalized social groups – including women and resource-poor farmers in low- and middle-income countries – in sustainable, profitable food systems. But digital interventions can also reinforce existing inequities by further increasing the competitive advantage of user groups privileged with literacy, access to smartphones, or high investment capacity. To ensure that the digital transformation in the Global South leaves no one behind, therefore, deliberate efforts are needed to promote the inclusivity of emerging digital innovations. To date, however, there is a lack of practical guidelines and tools to critically assess, demonstrate, and enhance the inclusivity of digital food systems interventions. Too often, inclusivity remains a blurry concept and distant objective. In result, digital development researchers and practitioners have limited incentives for investing time and effort into safeguarding inclusivity. With this short communication, we intend to contribute to future, practice-oriented discussions about social inclusivity in development-oriented digital interventions for sustainable food systems. We provide a critical reflection on the current discourse around digital inclusion in development context and outline challenges and opportunities for considering inclusivity in the design and deployment of digital food system innovations. Drawing on literature as well as the authors' own experiences with the design and implementation of digital innovations within research-for-development, we highlight 'blind spots' in the current discourse around digital inclusion in low- and middle-income country context. We then develop practical suggestions for overcoming these limitations. We propose a concrete agenda for enabling researchers and other innovation stakeholders, including donors, to contribute to more inclusive digital food system innovation in low- and middle-income countries. First, a standard concept and procedure is required for transparently assessing the inclusivity of digital services. Second, as many digital development stakeholders work under resource constraints, simple design tools can help them effectively consider social inclusion criteria during the design of digital solutions. Lastly, a stronger emphasis on inclusivity is required throughout the research-for-development system, ensuring that design processes themselves are inclusive, rather than considering only the final digital products. As the importance of digital innovation keeps growing within the wider agricultural development discourse, this article helps researchers and practitioners gain conceptual clarity on the goal of digital inclusion. Through concrete suggestions on how inclusivity could be considered in practice, the article promotes a more equitable, inclusive digital transformation of food systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite accelerated developments in agricultural innovations, there has been a limited progress in their adoption by smallholder farmers, especially in the Global South. Innovations are not adequately reaching farmers, and new technologies are often unsuitable for farmers, or the overall innovation landscape is discouraging the deployment of innovations at scale. The methodological approaches to designing, testing and scaling of innovations play an important role. Involving farmers in the innovation process from the start increases the likelihood of them being more relevant and having a higher chance of adoption. Whereas there is much literature on participatory approaches, there is a limited guidance on choosing an appropriate level of farmer participation across the innovation process. This study aims to develop practical guidance for researchers, development agents and project managers on how to choose an appropriate methodological approach with a suitable level of farmer participation for designing, testing and scaling of agricultural innovations, according to levels of innovation readiness and innovation use. Relevant scientific literature on participatory design, research and scaling of agricultural innovations was reviewed, followed by compiling lessons learned from selected vegetable innovation projects implemented by the World Vegetable Center (WorldVeg) in Asia and Africa. A list of methodological approaches for participatory design, testing and scaling of innovations was generated, with various levels of farmer participation. A simple guiding framework was then developed for choosing an appropriate approach with a suitable level of farmer participation, according to the readiness and use of the innovations. Examples of selected approaches and application of the proposed guidance are given in project case studies. Based on the literature review and experience at WorldVeg, we believe it is critical to choose the right level of participation based on how ready are the innovations for application in the local setting. This dimension of how ready the innovations are has been largely overlooked in earlier frameworks on farmer participation. The developed guidance generally recommends increasing participation with higher levels of technology readiness and use. In addition, farmer consultation in early research design should also be strengthened, to co-design locally relevant innovations. The overall innovation systems' landscape must be considered when researching and scaling new innovations. The guidance, experiences and lessons provided in this paper will be useful to various scholars, researchers, development agents, funders and project managers who aim to design, test and scale agricultural innovations in a more inclusive and responsible way.",

    "abstract": "Climate change profoundly affects agriculture through increased occurrences of extreme weather events, directly affecting crop growth and food security. The North China Plain (NCP), a significant region for winter wheat production, faces challenges from the changing climate, which could threaten agricultural output and sustainability. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a warming climate, fluctuating precipitation, and rising CO2 levels on winter wheat production in the NCP. Additionally, it developed adaptation strategies, such as modifying the timing of planting and adjusting irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer levels, to mitigate the negative impacts of a changing climate on grain production. Using the DSSAT CROPSIM CERES-Wheat and NWheat models, this study incorporated baseline climate data from 2001 to 2020 and future climate projections from 12 GCMs under the CMIP6 framework. The evaluation was segmented into four future terms (terms 1 to 4) spanning from 2021 to 2100, under two societal development scenarios known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5. The projections indicated an increase in temperature and precipitation over the century, with the most substantial changes under the SSP5–8.5 scenario. Term 1 (2021–2040) forecasts predicted mild temperature increases (0.89 °C increase in average maximum temperature, 0.74 °C in average minimum temperature) and an 8% increase in precipitation. Term 4 (2081–2100) projections indicated a more severe climate impact, with maximum temperatures rising by 3.19 °C, minimum temperatures by 3.07 °C, and seasonal precipitation increasing by 23%. These climatic changes are expected to reduce the winter wheat growing season by 4–17%, decrease grain numbers by 3–21%, and reduce yield by 4–20% compared to the baseline. However, the increase in CO2 from terms 1 to 4 could enhance grain yield by 4–30% under SSP5–8.5, indicating a complex interaction between climatic factors and crop productivity. This study showed that adaptation strategies, including adjusting planting times (early October), irrigation levels (300–400 mm), and nitrogen fertilizer application (250–300 kg ha−1), can effectively minimize the negative impacts of warming on grain yield. This study underscores the critical need for immediate and effective adaptation strategies to address the impact of climate change on agriculture. By adjusting agricultural practices, the negative effects on winter wheat production in the NCP can be mitigated, thereby contributing to regional food security in the face of ongoing climate challenges.",

    "abstract": "A key strategy in progressing towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is scaling innovations to improve livelihoods of marginalized populations globally. Consequently, there has been a heightened emphasis on Agriculture Research for Development (AR4D) innovation teams' ability to swiftly identify innovations that can be scaled for broad impact. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the equitable distribution of benefits among different demographic groups, leading to documented unintended consequences affecting some of the most marginalized communities. To effectively contribute to the SDGs and avoid harm to specific groups, AR4D innovation teams must conscientiously consider various dimensions of diversity, including gender and other relevant factors. Our objective is to introduce GenderUp, a new conversational method for responsible scaling, oriented to making scaling initiatives more inclusive and anticipatory of socially differentiated trade-offs. This new AR4D scaling tool seeks to ensure that scaling efforts not only contribute effectively to the SDGs but also consider and mitigate unintended consequences for marginalized communities. This paper describes a new socially responsible scaling tool. Starting with a defined innovation, GenderUp helps: i) identify relevant diversity and intersectionality among intended innovation users; and ii) re-direct scaling strategies to better anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences for specific social groups. Through a series of five stages, a GenderUp facilitator guides teams through discussions, learning activities, and practical integration to develop a socially responsible scaling strategy. We provide details about each stage and reflect on the results of two early pilot experiences. There is a need for increased recognition of the distribution of innovation benefits based on dimensions of diversity. GenderUp is proposed as a new method to systematically address social differentiation in the scaling of AR4D innovation. GenderUp supported two different innovation and scaling teams to rethink their scaling strategies. Both innovation teams identified at-risk intersectional profiles and made adjustments to their scaling strategies to ensure these groups were not harmed by the innovation or scaling activities. These promising examples suggest that GenderUp provides a simple ex-ante analysis that can reduce unintended consequences more broadly within AR4D. Although gender and social equity are prioritized globally there are very few experts, tools, and systems in place to achieve these cross-cutting goals. While GenderUp only addresses innovation at the scaling stage, it is a step towards systemizing responding to social differentiation within AR4D to at least do no harm, and at best improve social outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural innovations and their applications are increasingly recognized as crucial mechanisms for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Actors in agricultural research for development (AR4D) frequently use Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) frameworks to comprehend the ecosystems within which innovations are developed and scaled. Given the SDGs' emphasis on social outcomes, a reflection on social diversity, power, and the integration of social theory into AIS and AR4D tools is crucial for addressing the nuances of social objectives. This research critically evaluates AIS frameworks and AR4D tools through applying social theory to enhance social outcomes. We offer practical application through the development of \"Equity Principles for Social Transformation (EPs).\" These EPs are designed to guide AR4D organizations in innovation and scaling efforts that effectively achieve meaningful social outcomes. Through this approach, we aim to enrich the conceptual understanding of equity within AIS and provide practical strategies for implementing these insights, thus empowering AR4D actors to be more effective. We start by selecting key social theories to analyze global power imbalances and local social exclusion within AIS frameworks and AR4D tools. Using these theories, we examine three case studies to uncover gaps in their approach to social dimensions. We categorize these gaps through thematic analysis and formulate EPs informed by social theories and a practical understanding of AR4D tools. Equity analysis of each case study reveals gaps in understanding social implications within upstream and downstream research efforts. These gaps include insufficient addressing of power dynamics and agency recognition, lack of comprehensive guidance on critical social components, oversight of cultural and institutional norms, exacerbation of social inequities, and the case studies' limitations in flexibility for addressing social inclusion effectively. Additionally, there is a notable lack of clear operational guidelines for applying the frameworks in diverse contexts, including the challenge of translating conceptual levels into local action. Seven EPs were developed: recognize AR4D power dynamics; define goals, anti-goals, and for whom; build global \"horizontal\" partnerships; acknowledge social differences among innovation users and non-users; innovate and curate innovation appropriately; assess impact and reflect; and develop systems capacity. The EPs connect innovation systems with positive social change. They help AR4D professionals consider and evaluate the impact of innovation. The EPs provide an additional framework that enables AR4D practitioners to prioritize user needs from the beginning, challenge biases, and more effectively achieve the social objectives outlined in the SDGs.",

    "abstract": "Climate change's profound implications for Mediterranean agriculture underscores the urgency of adaptation strategies. These strategies, whether incentivized or farmer-driven, are pivotal in mitigating crop yield losses and harnessing evolving climatic conditions. While the influence of agronomic adaptations on crop yields is well-explored, the implications for water footprint and water balance components remain largely unexplored. With this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems in the Ombrone catchment, Tuscany. We estimate the impacts of both climate change and adaptation strategies - also referred to as management changes - on crop yields, water footprint and water balance components by comparing simulations with historical and future climate and with and without adaptation strategies. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) agro-hydrological model of the Ombrone catchment is calibrated for crop yields of durum wheat, sunflower and irrigated maize. The impacts of climate change are then assessed by forcing the calibrated model with climate data from five bias-corrected regional climate models under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Subsequently, we simulate six autonomous agronomic adaptation strategies (earlier and later sowing, supplemental irrigation, longer crop cycles, zero tillage and cover crops). We quantify their impacts on crop yield, water footprint and water balance components, such as evaporation, water yield and soil moisture. Our findings reveal negligible and adverse impacts on crop yields under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 respectively. Agricultural systems show strong adaptive capabilities under both RCPs, particularly when multiple strategies are combined. The most impactful strategies include earlier sowing and extended cropping cycles. Supplemental irrigation and cover crops are beneficial only with specific combinations of climate models and RCPs. While management changes have limited impact on basin-scale water balance components, they induce an average 27% reduction in water yield at the cropland scale, attributed to practices like zero tillage and cover crops. Despite the uncertain impacts of climate change, our research reveal that changing the management - hence applying adaptation strategies - will be sufficient to maintain or improve current crop yields. Furthermore, we also underscore the non-negligible influence of management changes related to conservation agriculture on water balance components in agricultural catchments. Future adaptation strategy assessments should encompass comprehensive integration to evaluate broader impacts on water resources.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT To improve agricultural sustainability, alternative cultivation methods and assessment tools need to be developed. Integrating service crops (SC) can potentially increase cropping system multifunctionality and mitigate negative climate and environmental impacts of agriculture. OBJECTIVES (1) Calibrate oats, winter wheat and red clover SC, grown as sole crops and intercrops, in the cropping system model APSIM NG for northern Europe climate conditions. (2) Use the calibrated crop modules to assess ecosystem processes from an intercropping system. (3) Discuss the role of mechanistic crop models in assessing ecosystem services and disservices from complex cropping systems. METHODS The crops were calibrated with data from an oats-winter wheat cropping sequence at two field sites. Thirty weather datasets were created from historical weather data to generate weather-dependent variability in crop performance and related processes. The assessment compared two scenarios, with or without an intercropped red clover SC sown in oats and terminated the following spring in winter wheat. Outputs representing processes related to important ecosystem services were extracted from the simulations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Calibration of the three crops resulted in satisfactory biomass levels at the end of the growing season. Including a SC reduced oat yield, but increased winter wheat yield in two-thirds of simulations. Model outputs showed that including a SC resulted in 33–79% more fresh soil organic carbon, depending on site, compared with no SC. Nitrogen (N) uptake by both crops was highest in the SC scenario. In oats, N losses did not differ between the two scenarios, while in winter wheat the SC scenario had approximately 50% lower N leaching losses and 30% higher gaseous N emissions. However, in the fallow period from winter wheat harvest through to spring, both types of N losses were elevated in the SC scenario. The SC scenario had only a minor effect on water dynamics, causing a small reduction in soil water content. SIGNIFICANCE In this paper we give an example of how APSIM NG can be used to assess ecosystem services from complex agricultural systems using a case study with intercropping of cereals and leguminous SCs. APSIM NG was useful in providing a holistic assessment, and we show that intercropping with a SC can improve cropping system performance and reduce negative impacts, but long-term strategic management of N is required to prevent increased losses. To further improve simulation of intercrops more accurate simulation of early growth is needed for all crops included.",

    "abstract": "The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is an Asian mega-delta which is vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise, and is undergoing demographic change. Farmers are encouraged to shift from rice monocultures to more diversified and flood-based cropping options to adapt to climate change, lessen negative environmental impacts and manage labour productivity. However, this transformation takes place slowly, especially in the flood-zone areas of the Upper VMD. There is currently limited understanding of farmers' complex decision-making that considers the dynamic interactions between farmers, socio-economic circumstances and biophysical environments in this sub-region. The objective of this study was to investigate the key factors driving farmers' decisions to switch between rice monocultures and other flood adaptive crops, and to provide lessons learnt and policy recommendations for sustainable and resilient agricultural transformation in the Upper VMD. The study developed an agent-based model to simulate individual decision making in the Upper VMD. The model was parameterised with secondary data on social, policy, economic and biophysical drivers and validated by comparing the simulation results with real data in the baseline. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to gain insights into influencing factors. The agent-based model shows that when farmers seek profit maximisation, the most influential determinants of their crop choice are high dyke construction, farmers' risk preference, perceptions of environmental sustainability, knowledge and market access of new alternatives, and labour availability. Considering the current context where the majority of farmers depend on high dykes, the transition away from rice monocultures and high dyke cropping systems, as envisaged by the Government, needs to occur gradually over an extended period and be contingent on a combination of measures that help implement existing policies at the local level. This includes discouraging high dyke construction; innovative extension services to raise farmer awareness of environmental sustainability and potential flood-adaptive cropping alternatives; targeted policies and actions for risk averse farmers; and market-based solutions to improve market access and mechanisation. This study contributes to the current discourse on sustainable and resilient agricultural development in the VMD. The agent-based model provides insights into the farmers' crop choices in the flood zone and factors influencing their choices. These are important inputs for locally targeted policy planning and implementation.",

    "abstract": "Global food systems are confronted with multifaceted challenges, including climate change, malnutrition, and biodiversity loss, disproportionately affecting the livelihoods of millions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Recognizing its potential to address these challenges, innovation is increasingly central in public sector organizations. However, despite growing emphasis, the adoption of innovation portfolio management approaches remains limited. Drawing on a case study of CGIAR, a global research partnership dedicated to agricultural challenges, this paper seeks to accomplish two objectives. The primary objective is to produce a set of best practices in innovation portfolio management that can benefit public sector organizations. The secondary objective is to demonstrate how this offers an important precursor to guide organizational decision-making and investment towards responsible food system transformation. An in-depth analysis of CGIAR's approach to innovation portfolio management is based on qualitative and quantitative data from sources such as interviews, observations, documents, and archival records. The study adopts a descriptive case study approach, utilizing an analytical framework that recognizes the importance of methods, mindsets, and mechanisms in describing and analyzing the CGIAR case. Key lessons encompass the need for a holistic perspective on innovation portfolio management. The paper advocates for the integration of an innovation portfolio management approach within broader (1) organizational processes, including human resources, finance, legal frameworks, and risk management; and (2) innovation systems where food system transformation is the outcome of interactions and partnerships between government, public and private sector organizations. This study furnishes actionable guidance to public organizations seeking to harness innovation portfolio management for responsible and impactful food system transformation.",

    "abstract": "Diversification is an important strategy used by millions of small-scale food producers globally to improve yields, farm profitability, and food security. Diversification can also enable small-scale producers to cope better with livelihood shocks. However, it is not always clear through which pathways diversification practices can stabilize livelihoods and food security in small-scale production systems, especially in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we examined whether and how diversification practices stabilized income and food availability in small-scale food production systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The diversification practices explored in this study included fish polyculture and integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA), and their combination. We compared small-scale systems employing different combinations of these diversification strategies, with systems that did not contain them. We analyzed 300 surveys of small-scale aquaculture producers in Myanmar. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the multivariate relationships between the adoption of diversification practices among the small-scale producers, and whether and how the adoption stabilized their livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar. We find that the integration of diversification practices in different small-scale aquaculture-agriculture (SSAA) production systems had generally positive effects for the stabilization of income, food availability or both during the COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty of the study is the unraveling of the differentiated pathways between production models that enabled these stabilization processes emerge. We find major divergences in the stabilization potential between polyculture and IAA, both in terms of the magnitudes of the stabilization effects and the pathways. Polyculture generally offered more significant stabilizing effects than IAA. Surprisingly the highest and more significant positive effects for the stabilization of food availability came through the purchase of food items from extra fish/crop income, rather than their increased self-consumption. Overall, the SSAA production systems combining different diversification practices could form proactive strategies to help small-scale food producers cope with livelihood shocks.",

    "abstract": "This simulation study explored the agricultural household effects of changes in the price of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer for farmers in central Malawi. We selected the Dedza district to conduct this study, which is a district reliant on maize production for household livelihoods. This study used data from a household survey to develop and calibrate an agricultural household model for a representative household. The survey focused on socio-economic and agronomic factors. This included plot-level agronomic details for crop inputs and yields. Using our dynamic model, we found a negative association between fertilizer prices and fertilizer use, maize area, and income. Removing fertilizer prices led to an increased use of nitrogen fertilizer at the household scale from 16.8 kg to 49.6 kg and this helped increase household income by 52%. We calculated an average own-price elasticity of fertilizer demand of − 0.92. Although higher fertilizer prices increased legume acreage, which had potential environmental benefits, household income fell. Our benefit-cost ratio calculations suggest that government actions that deliver changes in fertilizer prices are relatively cost effective. Our study highlights the reliance of households on maize production and consumption for their livelihood, and the effects that changes in fertilizer prices can have upon them.",

    "abstract": "There is growing demand to produce both food and renewable energy in a sustainable manner, while avoiding competition between food and energy production. In our study, we investigated the potential of harnessing biogas production into nutrient recycling in an integrated system of organic food production and food processing. We used the case of Agroecological Symbiosis (AES) at Palopuro, which is a combination of three farms, a biogas plant, and a bakery, as a case to explore how biogas production using feedstocks from the farms can be used to improve nutrient cycling, and to calculate how much energy could be produced from the within-system feedstocks. The current system (CS) used in organic farms, and the integrated farm and food processing AES system, were analyzed using Substance Flow analysis. In the AES, annual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) surpluses were projected to be reduced from 95 kg ha−1 to 36 kg ha−1 and from 3.4 kg ha−1 to −0.5 kg ha−1 respectively, compared to the CS. Biogas produced from green manure leys as the major feedstock, produced 2809 MWh a−1. This was 70% more than the energy consumed (1650 MWh a−1) in the systemand thus the AES system turned out to be a net energy producer. Results demonstrated the potential of biogas production to enhance the transition to bioenergy, nutrient recycling, and crop productivity in renewable localized farming and food systems.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of land health – the capacity of land, relative to its potential, to sustain delivery of ecosystem services – is recognized as a major global problem in general terms, but remains poorly quantified, resulting in a lack of specific evidence to focus action. Land health surveillance and response is designed to overcome limitations of current assessment approaches. It is modelled on science principles and approaches used in surveillance in the public health sector, which has a long history of evidence-informed policy and practice. Key elements of the science framework are: (i) repeated measurement of land health and associated risk factors using probability based sampling of well defined populations of sample units; (ii) standardized protocols for data collection to enable statistical analysis of patterns, trends, and associations; (iii) case definitions based on specific diagnostic criteria; (iv) rapid low cost screening tests to permit detection of cases and non-cases in large numbers of samples; (v) cost-effectiveness evaluation of interventions based on projected reduction in risks and problem incidence; (vi) design of statistically analysable studies to evaluate interventions in the real-world; (vii) meta-analysis of these data to guide design of public policy and intervention programmes; and (viii) integrating surveillance and the communication and use of results into operational systems as part of regular policy and practice. The scientific rigour of land health surveillance has potential to provide a sound basis for directing and assessing action to combat land degradation. Specialized national surveillance units should be established to harness and realign existing resources to provide integrated national land health systems. An international unit is needed to provide science and technology support to governments and develop standards, whereas an international agency should coordinate land health surveillance globally. Application of the surveillance framework could result in a shift away from a focus on rehabilitation of severely degraded land towards a preventive approach that focuses more on reducing distal risks at national and regional levels.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores agriculture and nutrition linkages in Bangladesh, a country that achieved rapid growth in rice productivity at a relatively late stage in Asia's Green Revolution, as well as unheralded progress against undernutrition. To do so, we first outline a simple conceptual model to identify the different impacts that productivity growth in a food staple(s) might have on child nutrition outcomes, with a particular focus on changes in diets at the household and child level. We then apply this framework to a descriptive overview of the evolution of Bangladesh's food system in recent decades. We show that this evolution is characterized rapid growth in yields and calorie availability, but relatively sluggish diversification in both food production and consumption, despite increasing reliance on imports for dietary diversification. Next, we create a multi-round district level panel that links changes in nutrition survey data with agricultural sample survey data over 1996–2011, a period in which rice yields rose by more than 70%. We then use this panel to more rigorously test for associations between yield growth and various anthropometric and child feeding indicators. Consistent with our descriptive evidence on dietary changes, we find that rice yields predict the earlier introduction of complementary foods to young children (most frequently rice) as well as increases in their weight-for-height, but no improvements in their dietary diversity or height-for-age. Since Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child wasting in the world, these significant associations between yields and child weight gain are encouraging, but the lack of discernible effects on children's dietary diversity or linear growth is cause for concern. Indeed, it suggests that further nutritional impacts will require diversifying the Bangladeshi food basket through both supply and demand-side interventions.",

    "abstract": "Innovations to improve staple crop germplasm can reduce poverty and otherwise improve farmer livelihoods through complex and multiple pathways. This paper reviews the evidence for one prominent pathway—through increased incomes (in cash and kind) for poor farmers who adopt the technology. An important determinant of poverty reduction is the ability of poor producers to adopt productivity-enhancing varieties, and the paper analyzes recent household-level data from two African countries to examine if poor producers face unique barriers to adoption. A second determinant of poverty reduction is the area available to plant these varieties and whether the intensity of adoption is great enough to significantly reduce poverty. The paper uses a double-hurdle estimation framework to model the adoption/area planted joint decision for maize farmers in Ethiopia and sweet potato farmers in Uganda. The focus of the analysis is the effect of poverty-related variables on adoption/area planted decisions. Farmer wealth, landholding, education, location, and access to support and information services are included to understand how correlates of poverty affect adoption decisions. We find evidence that landholding size is an important barrier to poverty reduction; poor farmers are able to adopt improved varieties, but their intensity is constrained by land availability. In Uganda, farmers at the 95th percentile of adoption area received about $0.13 per person per day from the incremental yield, covering < 50% of the mean household poverty gap. This gain only comes under optimistic assumptions and most adopters do not have sufficient area for the direct income effect to be large. The evidence suggests that direct, short-term impacts of increased productivity to increased income may be limited in magnitude. Nonetheless, we recognize that other, less direct pathways may be important, particularly over longer times. Impacts through indirect pathways are, however, more difficult to measure. This has implications for the design of M&E and the crafting of appropriate targets for outcomes of research on staple crops which should focus perhaps on the other pathways where poverty reduction is more probable.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades major changes have occurred in Australia's beef industry, affecting productivity and potentially the amount of resources used and environmental impacts from production. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach with a 'cradle-to-farm gate' boundary the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity and key resource use efficiency factors (water use, fossil fuel energy demand and land occupation) are reported for the 30 years from 1981 to 2010, for the Australian beef industry. The analysis showed that over the three decades since 1981 there has been a decrease in GHG emission intensity (excluding land use change emissions) of 14% from 15.3 to 13.1 kg CO2-e/kg liveweight (LW). The improvement was largely due to efficiency gains through heavier slaughter weights, increases in growth rates in grass-fed cattle, improved survival rates and greater numbers of cattle being finished on grain. However, the increase in supplement and grain use on farms, and the increase in feedlot finishing, resulted in a twofold increase in fossil fuel energy demand for beef production over the same time. Fresh water consumption for beef production dropped to almost a third from 1465 L/kg LW in 1981 to 515 L/kg LW in 2010. Three contributing factors for this dramatic reduction in water use were: (i)an increase in the competitive demand for irrigation water, resulting in a transfer away from pasture for cattle to higher value industries such as horticulture, (ii) an initiative to cap free flowing artesian bores in the rangelands, and (iii) an overall decline in water available for agriculture compared to industrial and domestic uses. While there was higher uncertainty relating to estimates of land occupation and emissions from land use (LU) and direct land use change (dLUC), an inventory of land occupation indicated a decline in non-arable land occupation of about 19%, but a sevenfold increase in land occupation for feed production, albeit from a low base in 1981. GHG emissions associated with LU and dLUC for grazing were estimated to have declined by around 42% since 1981, due largely to legislated restrictions on broad-scale deforestation which were introduced progressively between 1996 and 2006. This paper discusses the prospects and challenges for further gains in resource use efficiency and reductions in greenhouse gas intensity for Australian beef production.",

However, its acceptance level among farmers is often low due to its higher price, the need for additional fertilization, and the misconception that it would negatively affect yield and crop quality. This work presents a decision support system that would help them to make irrigation management decisions regarding the optimal combination of saline and desalinated seawater (DSW), which would provide maximum economic profit. The model has been specially designed for Mediterranean greenhouse cropping systems. The proposed model was validated by applying it to a real watermelon crop which was experimentally monitored. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted in order to analyze the effect of different limiting factors on the optimal combination of water and the optimal profit for farmers. The application of the model to the case study demonstrated that it is profitable to use a blend of DSW and brackish water for irrigation of greenhouse crops. Despite the higher cost of the DSW, the economic optimum was achieved for higher DSW fractions than those which are used today. This sensitivity analysis has demonstrated that brackish water salinity, irrigation uniformity and crop tolerance are relevant factors that affect the optimal combination decisions. This work may encourage farmers to accept desalinated water.",

    "abstract": "Coastal systems are facing natural and human-driven change coupled with a rising population. With increasing shifts in socioecological conditions during the past several decades, it is important to understand how socioecological drivers at different hierarchical levels: -micro, -meso, and -macro affect coastal farming systems, which play a crucial role in the livelihoods of coastal dwellers. Mixed rice-livestock-aquaculture farming in Southern Bangladesh exemplifies the rapid change occurring in many of the world's coastal farming systems in response to these drivers. We used panel data observations from the above study area and modeled trajectories of farm typologies, and the impact of multi-level socioecological drivers by a novel approach. Our approach integrates: (1) a well-articulated conceptual frame of change observed using (2) a temporal view of the potential drivers, change process and farm type outcomes, with the twenty years panel data of 502 households that is analyzed by means of (3) multivariate statistics in conjunction with panel data models that operationalize the conceptual frame. Our approach allows (a) estimating dynamic effects over time that typically cannot be estimated in a cross-sectional data set, (b) distinguishing between time-invariant fixed and time dependent random effects of multi-level socioecological drivers, and (c) controlling for omitted variables to a certain extent. Considering farming systems both within and outside of polder embankment systems intended to protect against oceanic water intrusion, we found a gradual shift from heterogeneous, rice-livestock farm types to more homogenous farms with less livestock and more off-farm activities. Micro-level factors including farm plot fragmentation, farmers' experience in cropping, machinery, salinity and soil fertility were influencing changes in farming systems. Meso-level factors including markets, road infrastructure, labor availability, access to extension and land tenure also affect the trajectory of farming systems change. Among macro-level drivers, increasing population density positively and significantly influenced cropping intensity among farms outside polder systems. Within polders, a positive but non-significant trend was observed for the influence of population density on cropping intensity. Our data also indicate negative and significant influence of cyclonic storms on cropping intensity over time in both areas. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for multiple levels of socioecological drivers of change when developing appropriate policy options for sustainable development in South Asia's coastal farming systems.",

    "abstract": "African farmers are poorly resourced, highly diverse and aground by poverty traps making them rather impervious to change. As a consequence R4D efforts usually result in benefits but also trade-offs that constraint adoption and change. A typical case is the use of crop residues as mulches or as feedstock. Here we linked a database of household surveys with a dynamic whole farm simulation model, to quantify the diversity of trade-offs from the alternative use of crop residues. Simulating all the households in the survey (n = 613) over 99 years of synthetic climate data, showed that benefits and trade-offs from \"mulching or munching\" differ across agro-ecologies, and within agro-ecologies across typologies of households. Even though trade-offs between household production or income and environmental outcomes could be managed; the magnitude of the simulated benefits from the sustainable intensification of maize-livestock systems were small. Our modelling framework shows the benefits from the integration of socio-economic and biophysical approaches to support the design of development programs. Our results support the argument that a greater focus is required on the development and diversification of farmers' livelihoods within the framework of an improved understanding of the interconnectedness between biophysical, socio-economic and market factors.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural production in Northern Ghana is dominated by smallholder farm systems, which are characterized by low inputs and low outputs, declining soil fertility, large yield gaps and limited adoption of agricultural technologies. There is an urgent need for alternative farm designs that are more productive, yet more sustainable. Technology packages for sustainable intensification are promoted by an R4D project in the Upper East, Upper West and Northern Regions of Ghana. In this paper, we analyse differences in perceived suitability, and modelled technical impact per technology package. We used a locally validated framework to categorise farm systems diversity that considers both, the horizontal (between households) and vertical (within households) dimension of diversity. Farm households were classified along a gradient of resource endowment. We selected one representative farm per type and per region to assess and compare their socio-economic and environmental performance (farm profitability, labour and soil organic matter inputs) using the whole-farm model Farm DESIGN. We then used Farm DESIGN to assess the potential impact of five proposed technology packages and to explore promising alternative farm configurations. We discussed model assumptions and results with farmers, including alternative cropping patterns and trade-offs. We evaluated the packages with different household members using a weighted scoring technique, subsequently juxtaposing model results with farmer perceptions. Large differences prevailed among and within farms per type and per region, with low resource endowed farms being projected to benefit most in relative and least in absolute terms from an adoption of the packages. Farmer feedback confirmed the accuracy of alternative farm configurations, as determined by the model. However, the feedback also revealed that the most profitable farm designs would be hard to attain in reality, particularly for members of low and medium resource endowed households, due to high initial investment costs. Within households, women were more positive about the packages than men, since men heavily penalized extra costs and labour, translating into a greater congruence of model results with the male evaluation. We discuss the importance of distinguishing between technical (technology i.e. purchased tools and inputs) and managerial (techniques e.g. row planting) package components. We conclude that operationalizing inter- and intra-household diversity is a fundamental step in identifying sensible solutions for the challenges smallholder farm systems face in Northern Ghana.",

    "abstract": "Food loss and waste in the US has been estimated at 40%, a figure that does not include losses at the agricultural level. Consumer food waste is expensive and environmentally damaging as it travels the length of the supply chain and largely ends up in the landfill. Most research and campaigns emphasize the consumer level, which has resulted in the omission of data collection and development of solutions for producers of fruit and vegetable crops. The available estimates of edible produce lost in the field are based on assumptions and estimates, rather than field data. Therefore, this project aimed to measure losses in the field in order to understand if estimates are accurate. Sixty-eight fields of eight vegetable crops were evaluated on nine North Carolina farms during the 2017 production season, using a sampling and scaling method. Combining the unharvested crops of marketable quality and edible but not marketable quality (produce that does not meet appearance quality standards), the average produce volume available after the primary harvest was 5114.59 kg per hectare. Totaling an average of 42% of the marketed yield for these crops, these high figures indicate the need for a reevaluation of the food loss estimates at the agricultural level in the US, and a focus on solutions.",

    "abstract": "A large variety of models has been developed to explore the multidimensional, and sometimes conflicting, sustainability consequences of innovations and policies for European livestock farms. Implementation of innovations and policies generally results in both synergies and trade-offs between the environmental, economic, and social dimension of sustainability, and among sustainability themes within these dimensions. An overview of the specific sustainability themes addressed by livestock models is lacking, which hinders the further development of models to evaluate a wide array of sustainability dimensions and themes. The aim of this review, therefore, is to provide an overview of European livestock models that can be used to explore synergies and trade-offs among sustainability themes. This systematic literature review yielded 215 European livestock models at the animal level, herd or flock level and farm level. Models were mainly developed in Western Europe, and may have, therefore, a reduced accuracy when applied to other regions than Western Europe. Most models cannot assess a wide array of synergies and trade-offs among sustainability dimensions and themes, as only 33% covered all three sustainability dimensions. Models addressed four sustainability themes on average. Social themes are often lacking in models and additional efforts are needed to develop more integrative models by adapting and extending existing models, especially for monogastric animals. Adaptation and extension of existing models is facilitated by improving the availability of livestock models, increasing the percentage of livestock models published open source, collaborating on the development of joint and generic models and by improving descriptions of the programming languages and programs used and the stakeholders involved. This model review can be used to identify which models or combinations of models are best suited to explore the sustainability consequences of innovations and policies for livestock farms in Europe.",

    "abstract": "Many of the climate change mitigation options for dairy systems that aim at optimizing milk production imply a reduced output of meat from these systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of a number of mitigation strategies for dairy systems, taking into account compensation for changes in the amount of beef produced. Four commonly used mitigation strategies for dairy systems were evaluated using an LCA modelling approach: increasing the milk production per cow, extending the productive life span of cows, increasing the calving interval, and changing breed from Holstein Friesian to Jersey. The Dutch dairy system was taken as a case study. For each scenario, analyses were done in two steps. First, effects of the mitigation strategy on production of milk and carcass weight from the dairy system were calculated. Second, GHG emission intensities were calculated for three different functional units (FU): one kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), one kg of carcass weight (CW), and a fixed amount of milk and beef (i.e. 1 kg FPCM and 40 g CW). In the third FU, in case the amount of CW produced by the dairy system was lower than 40 g per kg FPCM, the remainder was compensated by CW produced in pure beef systems, assuming a GHG emission intensity of 30 kg CO2-eq. per kg CW for pure beef. Results showed a reduction in CW per kg FPCM from the dairy system in all four mitigation strategies. Considering GHG emissions per kg of FPCM only, the strategies reduced emissions by 0.2 to 18.1%. When considering emissions per kg of CW only, emissions were reduced by 12.5 to 48.9%. However, when we used a FU of 1 kg FPCM and 40 g CW, changes in emissions ranged from −0.2 to 3.8%. This was caused by the compensation of the lower CW production from dairy systems by CW from pure beef systems. Differences in emissions per kg FPCM and 40 g CW were smaller when the assumed emission intensity of pure beef was lower. We concluded that the mitigation strategies for dairy systems evaluated in this study were less effective for reduction of GHG emissions from production of milk and beef, when accounting for changes in the amount of beef produced. This study showed that the challenge of reducing GHG emissions of milk and beef production is interrelated. Hence, analyses of GHG emissions related to changes in production of milk and beef requires an integrated approach, beyond the system boundaries of the dairy farm.",

    "abstract": "Mountain regions are characterized by complex interrelations between human and natural systems. Political and socioeconomic drivers at various scales affect mountain farming systems functioning, resulting in farm structural changes (management, structure and economic performance). Longitudinal studies help fully understand the dynamics of these systems, identify their main drivers of change, and prepare for foreseeable future events. This study aimed to (i) analyse the main changes of cattle farming systems in the Pyrenees from 1990 to 2018, (ii) identify the different trajectories of farm evolution and (iii) to determine the key drivers of those trajectories at global, regional and household levels. We monitored 50 cattle farms in three valleys with different socioeconomic contexts, which were surveyed in 1990, 2004 and 2018. We observed clear changes regarding land and labour production factors. Over the 1990–2004 period, farming systems experienced a land use extensification (one-month increase of grazing season) and capital intensification (55% increase of livestock units (LU) per work unit (WU)) processes, coinciding with a switch from dairy to beef farming with on-farm fattening. Over the 2004–2018 period, land use stabilised but the capital intensification process went on (17% increase of LU/WU) while farms reduced their inputs (43% decrease of feeding costs per LU), in parallel to the decreasing importance of fattening. These changes allowed to globally maintain stable farm economic margins (around 40,000 €/WU). Multivariate statistical analyses enabled to identify four trajectories of evolution, three of them specific to each valley under study and a common across-valleys trajectory. These trajectories resulted from the interaction between global and regional drivers and household particularities. The CAP played a major role at the global level (representing an average of 70% of farm gross margin in 2004 and 2018), while tourism development and household characteristics were the main drivers at the regional level. Several farms responded by maximising their output related to the most limiting production factor (i.e. agriculture land or labour) in each valley. However, the across-valleys trajectory, which comprised 44% of farms, showed limited changes during the studied period. The ability of farms to maintain their adaptation capacity while keeping economic and social viability will determine the future of cattle farming in the region. Our findings highlight the need of reorienting agricultural policies towards promoting new entrants into mountain farming, better integrating CAP instruments with other EU sectorial policies and improving farm monitoring by disaggregating follow-up processes by agroecosystem and management regimes.",

    "abstract": "The dairy sector is an important contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Foot lesions in dairy cows result in production losses and, therefore, might increase GHG emissions per kg milk. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of foot lesions in dairy cows on GHG emissions. A dynamic stochastic simulation model was developed to estimate dynamics of digital dermatitis (DD), white line disease (WLD), and sole ulcer (SU), and associated production losses within one lactation. Production losses included were reduced milk production, prolonged calving interval (CI), and culling. Subsequently, a life cycle assessment was performed to estimate the impact of foot lesions on GHG emissions per ton of fat-and-protein-corrected milk (kg CO2e/t FPCM). GHG emissions increased on average by 14 (1.5%) kg CO2e/t FPCM per case of foot lesions (i.e. DD, WLD, and SU combined), ranging from 17 kg CO2e/t FPCM in parity 1, to 7 kg CO2e/t FPCM in parity 5. Emissions of GHGs increased on average by 4 (0.4%) kg CO2e/t FPCM per case of DD, by 39 (4.3%) kg CO2e/t FPCM per case of WLD, and by 33 (3.6%) kg CO2e/t FPCM per case of SU. A prolonged CI explained the majority of the increase in GHG emissions for cows with DD, whereas culling was most important for cows with WLD or SU. DD had the lowest impact on GHG emissions, but the highest prevalence, and, therefore, contributed most to the average impact of foot lesions. This study showed that preventing different types of foot lesions can reduce GHG emissions from the dairy sector. The increasing attention for global warming and possible policies to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture might give dairy farmers another incentive to prevent foot lesions. The impact of foot lesions on GHG emissions, however, can vary among dairy farms, because of differences in prevalence of foot lesions and associated production losses, and in farm management.",

This study aims to quantify the GHG reduction potential of the New Zealand (NZ) beef sector when replacing beef breeding cows and their calves with dairy beef animals. To this end, we combined a cattle herd model of NZ beef and dairy production with GHG emission calculations of beef production. We computed GHG emissions (to farm-gate stage) of the current amount of beef produced, while increasing the number of dairy beef calves at the expense of the number of suckler-beef calves. GHG emissions were 29% lower per kg carcass weight for dairy beef animals compared to suckler-beef animals. The average emission intensity decreased from 21.3 to 16.7 kg CO2e per kg carcass weight (−22%) as the number of suckler-beef animals declined to zero and dairy beef animals increased. Integrating dairy and beef production would enable the NZ beef sector to reduce annual GHG emissions by nearly 2000 kt CO2e (i.e. 22% of the total sector's emissions), while the dairy sector would improve their social licence to operate by reducing the number of surplus dairy calves slaughtered from 4-days old.",

    "abstract": "Smallholder agriculture is an important source of livelihoods in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In these regions the highest concentrations of nutritionally vulnerable populations are found. Agricultural development needs to be nutrition-sensitive, and contribute simultaneously to improving household nutrition, farm productivity and environmental performance. We explored the windows of opportunities for farm development and the potential of crop diversification options for meeting household dietary requirements, whilst concurrently improving household economic performance in contrasting smallholder farm systems in Kenya and Vietnam. Farm and household features and farmer perspectives and priorities were integrated into a farm-household model that allowed quantification of a diverse set of nutritional, labour and productive indicators. Using a multi-objective optimization algorithm, we generated 'solution spaces' comprising crop compositions and management configurations that would satisfy household dietary needs and allowed income gains. Results indicated site-specific synergies between income and nutritional system yield for vitamin A. Diversification with novel vegetables could cover vitamin A requirements of 10 to 31 extra people per hectare and lead to greater income (25 to 185% increase) for some households, but reduced leisure time. Although the Vietnamese sites exhibited greater nutrient system yields than those in Kenya, the household diets in Kenya had greater nutrient adequacy due to the fact that the Vietnamese farmers sold greater proportions of their on-farm produced foods. We conclude that nutrition-sensitive, multi-method approaches have potential to identify solutions to simultaneously improve household income, nutrition and resource management in vulnerable smallholder farming systems.",

We developed three new modules related to budget, labor, and human nutrition for the bio-economic whole-farm model 'FarmDESIGN'. The expanded model positions the farming enterprise within the farm household. We illustrate the model's new capabilities for farm households in two villages in Northwest Vietnam, where we conducted multi-objective optimization to identify options for improving the farm households' current performance on key sustainability and livelihood indicators. Modeling results suggest trade-offs between environmental, economic, and social objectives are common, although not universal. The new modules increase the scope for modeling flows of resources (namely cash, labor, and food) between the farm enterprise and the farm household, as well as beyond the farm gate. This allows conducting modeling explorations, optimization routines, and scenario analyses in farming systems research.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the aptness of a system approach to predict the level of contamination in a given agricultural product. As a showcase, the impact of climate and agrichemical use on the occurrence of food safety hazards in feed of dairy cows in the Netherlands was used. Data on chemical hazards in dairy cows' feed in the Netherlands for the years 2000 to 2013 were retrieved from the Dutch monitoring program KAP (Quality Program for Agricultural Products). Climate data (17 variables) and agrichemical usage figs. (6 variables) for the Netherlands were obtained from the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, the European Commission Joint Research Center's Agri4Cast database, and FAO's FAOSTAT. A Bayesian Network (BN) was constructed with this data and optimized for the prediction of the contamination level. The overall accuracy of prediction of the level of contamination in feed was 90.3%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that many climate and agrichemical variables contributed to the prediction; however, their individual contribution was generally small. The applicability of the BN was demonstrated in more detail for grass and maize as feed components. The observed trends in contamination of these crops were accounted for by climate and agrichemical variables, with the impact varying amongst the specific variables and commodities. The variables with the highest impact were \"days of precipitations in a month with ≥ 2.5 mm\" and \"annual use of herbicides\". The results demonstrate that data-driven BNs can capture complex interactions, thereby enabling high-accuracy predictions. Whilst the applicability of this approach to the safety of dairy cows' feed in the Netherlands has thus been demonstrated, it can also be applied to other areas of food safety when a systems approach is needed. Such models can support risk assessors and risk managers in their understanding of the impacts of a given factor on food and feed safety, and inform the latter's decisions to mitigate potential risks.",

    "abstract": "Mixed crop-livestock farms are important production systems worldwide and dominate Australia's broadacre agricultural regions. While integration of crops and livestock can offer many benefits, these are often intertwined and are hard to quantify explicitly. This paper set out to examine specifically the financial risk and return implications from operating a farm portfolio involving segregated crop and livestock enterprises considering both production variability and commodity price variability. Crop and livestock production from representative systems were simulated over 40 years at six locations spanning Australia's crop-livestock zone using coupled biophysical production simulation models, APSIM for cropping enterprises and GRAZPLAN for livestock enterprises. Time series of varying prices and costs for the same period were derived using historical data. Annual gross margins for each enterprise and different proportional land allocations to the farm were calculated either allowing both production and price to vary or keeping either constant at average values. At all locations the livestock enterprise had less downside risk than the cropping enterprises (as measured by conditional value at risk). Across both enterprises, the impact of production variability was greater than price variability at 5 of the 6 locations. Annual gross margins from the modelled crop and livestock enterprises were not well correlated with each other. Hence, even in the absence of biophysical interactions, the risk-efficient frontier included mixtures of crops and livestock enterprises at most sites. At two sites, a mix of 20–40% crop resulted in the lowest downside risk, while at other sites there was a clear trade-off between maximising farm returns and minimising risk across a range of crop-livestock mixtures. This is the first study to explicitly quantify and show across a diversity of environments in Australia's mixed farming systems that operating a mixture of even segregated crop and livestock enterprises in a farming business can help farmers optimise their risk-return trade-off. Similar risk mitigation benefits may be achieved through crop-livestock systems in other agricultural regions exposed to high climate and price variability.",

    "abstract": "Fruit trees stop their growth over the coldest period of the year to avoid damage. To resume their growth and for successful fruit production, they need to accumulate winter chill. It is expected that global warming will diminish winter chill availability with potentially negative impacts on the viability and yield of these crops. The objective of this study was to assess the viability of seven tree crops among the most relevant in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands. For this purpose, chilling requirements were gathered from the literature to define a requirement range for each tree crop encompassing most of the varieties used in Spain. Then the bias-adjusted outputs of an ensemble of 10 regional climate models under the two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 4.5 and 8.5, were used to feed a chilling model for calculating chill accumulation. The ensemble's outcome agreement index was applied to each combination of chill requirement and climate ensemble to assess crop viability. This was done by testing the hypothesis that the winter chill accumulation will be greater than the safe winter chill for the 2021–2050 (near future) and 2071–2100 (far future) periods and for both RCPs. A future reduction in the safe winter chill areas is projected with high agreement in climate projections across peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands independently of the RCP or future period. The crops studied would be viable in the near future period as long as varieties with low chilling requirements are used. These varieties, however, would not be adequate in the far future in some currently highly productive regions, where the situation would become more severe, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. In these cases, adaptation would be possible by shifting the crop to adjacent areas together with careful variety selection in terms of chilling requirements. The results indicate that the RCP8.5 scenario in the far future has an especially negative impact on the crops analysed, calling for resolute mitigation measures to guarantee tree crop production and food security. Recommendations for adaptation, with low uncertainty regarding climate projections, were included here, using actual tree varieties, thereby facilitating interpretation and on-field application for farmers and agricultural technicians.",

    "abstract": "There is a widespread acknowledgement that research should be supporting farmers'' transition processes towards more sustainable farming systems by applying participatory research approaches. However, scientific papers dealing with participatory research on farming systems seldom include a reflection on the outcome of these processes or the methodological implications of such an aim. The aim of the research process presented in this paper was together with a group of Danish farmers to explore the potential use of species mixtures in their own farming contexts by following several participatory research principles. 16 farmers volunteered to participate in the joint research process initiated by on-farm experimentation with a diverse catch crop mixture. The paper presents seven activities of the research process carried out using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods such as an applied game, farm visits, on-farm experimentation, common evaluations and discussions. The authors have analysed the process as a case study using three levels of empirical observations and descriptive narratives. The authors found that the farmers were involved throughout the two-and-a-half-year study period and experimented with species mixtures using different strategies. With the researchers, they identified and challenged structural, agronomic, technical and social barriers, and investigated the potential of species mixtures adapted to local conditions. The case study revealed that both farmers and researchers need to take on new roles, with farmers needing to invest their resources and time to come up with valuable data and knowledge. Similarly, researchers need to facilitate the explorative research process by meeting farmers'' needs while being able to draw valuable scientific conclusions. This requires new skills that have not traditionally been valued in agricultural sciences. This study demonstrates that the barriers to changing farmers'' cropping practices are not necessarily due solely to technical challenges or a lack of knowledge. Instead, researchers need to look beyond the farm gate and involve other actors in unlocking the potential of an increased use of species mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to climate stress is an unprecedented challenge facing cropping systems. Most adaptation assessments focus on how adaptation options affect yields of a single crop under different weather or climate conditions. Yet, cropping systems often comprise more than one crop, and holistic assessments should consider all crops grown in a cropping system. One adaptation option is Conservation Agriculture that is commonly defined around a set of three principles: minimum mechanical soil disturbance, permanent soil organic cover, and crop species diversification. Here we estimated the statistical effect of Conservation Agriculture on cropping-system yields under historical climate conditions. The cropping-system yields considered all crops grown including maize (Zea mays L.) and legumes in intercropping or rotation, or both. The climate conditions included conditions of heat stress for maize and precipitation balances during the maize growing season. Heat stress for maize was studied using growing degree days over 30 °C. Precipitation balance was the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration. Data included 6296 yield observations from on-farm trials in farmer plots conducted over 14 seasons (2005–2006 to 2018–2019) in ten communities in Malawi. These yield data were coupled with daily weather data. We studied three treatments: (1) a Control Practice treatment where the soil was tilled, crop residues were removed, and there was no crop species diversification, (2) a No-Tillage treatment where the soil was not tilled, crop residues were retained, and there was no crop species diversification, and (3) a Conservation Agriculture treatment where the soil was not tilled, crop residues were retained, and there was crop species diversification through legume intercropping. The use of maize varieties and legume rotation changed over time; however, the treatments studied remained the same over the entire length of the on-farm trials period in all individual communities. Results of our study showed that heat stress for maize had a negative effect on cropping-system yields for non-stress-tolerant maize varieties and no legume rotation, although the Conservation Agriculture treatment reduced this negative effect compared with the Control Practice treatment. With the use of stress-tolerant maize varieties and legume rotation and Conservation Agriculture, our results suggest that heat stress for maize did not have a negative effect on cropping-system yields. Our results demonstrate how Conservation Agriculture can improve the adaptive capacity of cropping systems and this provides urgently needed evidence on how farmers can adapt to climate stress.",

    "abstract": "As the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector has begun to manifest itself in its severity, adaptation planning has come under scrutiny for favoring the preservation of status-quo conditions over more substantial changes. The uptake of transformational adaptations, involving a significant re-structuring of the agricultural system, is however hindered by a lack of assessment tools capable of quantifying the effects of these often more complex, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes. Agent-based models can simulate decision processes and multi-level feedbacks between system components and may therefore illustrate how transformational adaptations emerge and help identify cases where their implementation is necessary and desirable. We explore this modelling potential and aim to quantify (1) how climate change, farmer behavior and water policies may influence strategic adaptation decision-making at the farm-level, (2) the extent to which implemented adaptations represent transformations, and (3) their impact on farm structure and wider socio-ecological change. We investigate these aims through a case study of crop farming systems in the drought-prone historical region of Romagna (NE Italy), integrating insight from stakeholder interviews, local reports, spatially-explicit biophysical data and behavioral theory in the construction of an agent-based model. Results show that, on average, more than half of all implemented adaptations are transformations, thereby requiring important social and financial investments from farmers. The number of implemented transformations is highest in scenarios where drought risk perception among farmers is more widespread, notably in scenarios simulating drier climates, more adaptive behaviors and policies promoting greater water use efficiency. Under higher drought risk perception, farmers are motivated to explore a broader set of adaptations, including those outside of the trajectory determined by their farming strategy. This process particularly favors the implementation of transformational increases in farm size and irrigated area, eventually stimulating farmers to adopt an expansionist strategy. Regionally, these adaptations lead to the smallest decline in agricultural extent with fewest, yet highest profit-earning farmers, largely exacerbating presently occurring trends. Under policy scenarios simulating increased irrigation availability, fewer farmers initially experience drought and therefore perceive a drought risk. Consequently, fewer farmers undertake transformational adaptations and switch from a contractive to an expansive strategy, culminating in a relatively smaller and less profitable agricultural extent despite a larger farmer population. As transformative changes to farming strategy trigger farmers to engage in new path-dependencies, aims of water policies may therefore rebound into unintended effects, emphasizing the importance of accounting for transformational perspectives.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest and importance for responsible research and innovation (RRI) among academic scholars and policy makers, especially, in relation to emerging technologies in the agricultural context. While the evolution of smart technologies in agriculture has led to an increase of available solutions that can be used by farmers, the RRI process of new farming technology has been minimally detailed in research contributions to date. This paper thus aims to describe the first 3 phases of a design thinking process to aid with the development of an agricultural innovation, namely, a geotag photo application for use on smart devices. The design thinking approach involved engaging with target users, such as farmers, farm advisors and inspectors, alongside research scientists, app developers and the national agricultural governing body in Ireland to commence the app development process. This paper describes methodology used to elicit the first three major phases of the design thinking approach: empathise, define and ideation. In the first phase a stakeholder mapping activity was conducted, as well as 7 focus groups and 10 interviews with users and other key actors regarding the challenges and needs related to using the app. The define phase included a reflection of results from the first phase and subsequent development of user-personas and problem statements to inform the third phase. The third phase, ideation, consisted of four interactive user-centred workshops, focusing on app needs, in which ideas and solutions were developed and prioritised. The design thinking approach supported multiple stakeholders to express and evaluate the benefits and challenges they associated with the initial development phases involved in designing a new geotag photo app. It also revealed that, by including farmers and additional actors in developing new farming technology enables technology developers to harness the full value of multiples types of knowledge and expertise. In conclusion, future research on innovation development should consider that by enabling engagement among a wide variety of actors, such as that offered by the initial stages of design thinking, and attending to a greater diversity of values is essential to the development of a responsible, and responsive, digital tool. This study is the first to methodically document the early stages of developing a geotag smartphone app using a design thinking approach. This paper will therefore benefit other scholars aiming to include farmers, and other agricultural stakeholders to have an input on the agri-tech development decisions that will ultimately impact their farming lives.",

    "abstract": "There are high hopes that digital tools can reduce constraints to livestock development, which in turn promises to alleviate poverty, improve food and nutrition security, and reduce environmental footprints. Yet, little systematic evidence exists on the state of digital livestock in low- and middle-income-countries. Thus, it remains unclear whether such high hopes are justified. Focusing on India and Kenya, we aim to better understand, among others, the degree of technological sophistication of the digital tools used, the types of value chains and constraints addressed, the types of business models pursued, and more broadly the opportunities and challenges of digital tools for agricultural development. We combine a review of digital tools in India and Kenya with three \"on-the-ground\" case studies: Herdman, a tool for Indian dairy organizations working with small-scale livestock keepers, facilitating data collection and supervision of field agents; Farmtree, a tool supporting medium-scale livestock keepers in India to manage their herds, and iCow, an e-extension tool for farmers in Kenya. For the review, we develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes different types of tools: 1) \"simple digital tools\", providing generic information, 2) \"smart digital tools\", providing tailored information based on data entered by livestock keepers, 3) \"smart digital tools\", using data from sensors, 4) \"digital tools for value chains\", enabling the integration of value chain actors, 5) \"automated digital systems\", which are coupled with robots, allowing for automation. Digital tools provide many new options to address constraints to livestock development. So far, most tools are \"simple digital tools\", followed by \"smart digital tools\" using manual data and tools for value chains. Such tools that only require smartphone ownership are the \"sweet spot\" for supporting digital livestock development; however, even embodied \"smart digital tools\" using sensors can be of relevance for small-scale livestock keepers with appropriate organizational models. Most digital tools focus on dairy production, suggesting neglect of other types of livestock, and there are few tools for pastoralists. The conceptual framework as well as many of the lessons learned are of relevance to understanding the contribution of digital tools to livestock development - and agricultural development more broadly - in low- and middle-income-countries. While digital tools are no silver bullets – and come with some new challenges such as data security and sovereignty concerns - they are likely to become a key pillar of agricultural and livestock development in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Chicken and eggs make important contributions to the food and nutrition security of low-income households in Myanmar, making it important to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on Myanmar's poultry sector. First, we evaluate the responsiveness and resilience of different chicken and egg farming systems in Myanmar to the shock of COVID-19. Second, we evaluate implications of the performance of the chicken and egg sector during COVID-19 for the Sustainable Development Goals. We conducted six waves of telephone interviews from June to November 2020 with 269 chicken farms close to Yangon. We compared impacts in two types of production system - broilers and layers - using a survey of the same farms conducted in 2019 as a baseline. For each type of farm, we compared 'integrated' and 'non-integrated' farms, where integration involves combining production of chickens and fish. First, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted chicken and egg production. More than 30% of broiler farms and 10% of layer farms closed before June, 42% of long-term farmworkers were laid off, and indicators of business sentiment were much more pessimistic than in 2019. Second, the sector experienced a V-shaped recovery until September 2020 when a second wave of COVID-19 hit Myanmar. Third, the impacts of COVID-19 vary by production system. Broiler farms have a much shorter production cycle than layer farms and were able rapidly adjust operational status by closing or reopening, whereas very few layer farms reopened after closing. Fourth, integrated layer-fish farms proved more resilient to the shock of COVID-19 than layer farms, with 90% of layer-fish farms and 76% of layer farms remaining operational in November, but there was no difference in the performance of broiler-fish and broiler farms. Fifth, the slow supply response of layer farms has meant higher egg prices for consumers, likely affecting nutritional intakes and making it more difficult for Myanmar to achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030. The results contribute to understanding of the challenges faced by chicken farms in Myanmar during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of their adaptive responses. Results have implications for other countries in Asia where integrated livestock-fish farms are common, and other developing countries where the poultry sector is expanding rapidly.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed an unprecedented threat to both societies and economies. The dairy sector is an example of the challenges that food supply chains have faced due to the pandemic. This study aims to provide primary evidence of the immediate effects of COVID-19 on the global dairy sector, particularly focusing on the outcome of the implemented response mechanisms, and the potential medium and long-term implications of the pandemic on the sector. We employed a longitudinal qualitative analysis framework that combines the use of questionnaires, media-search, focus-group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and secondary evidence reviews. Information was gathered at two points in time: three months after the beginning of the outbreak and one year later. We applied this framework in five different geographical regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Our study indicates that the pandemic has been perceived as a series of episodes affecting the sector from both demand and supply sides. These waves have impacted the sector differently depending on regions and countries' trade profiles, relative resource scarcity, per capita income, and market structure. Although in one year the sector has mostly recovered from the shock, the analysis concludes that the pandemic has accelerated on-going structural changes taking place in the dairy sector. The study expands existing knowledge about the effects of the pandemic on the dairy sector and adds to the newly evolving literature about the medium and long-term effects of the COVID-19 on food systems across the globe. Despite the preliminary nature of the results, they provide important insights to inform sectorial policy discussions.",

    "abstract": "A host of best water and soil management practices (BMPs) hold promise in addressing water scarcity and land degradation to enable sustainable crop intensification in smallholder farming systems. OBJECTIVE This study quantifies the effect of BMPs on crop productivity, income, water saving and water balance components and identifies gaps for future research. This paper synthesizes the performance of BMPs and the existing data gap by reviewing 108 published studies from the Indian subcontinent which capture a diverse range of rainfall and cropping systems. In situ conservation measures helped enhance crop yields by 200–1000 kg/ha, reduced cost of cultivation and enhanced incomes by US$ 10–200/ha/year. The BMPs were helpful in enabling annual water saving in the range of 50 mm to 300 mm by either conserving residual soil moisture or saving irrigation water resulting in enhanced water productivity. Interventions such as direct seeded rice and laser land leveling were found most effective in terms of water saving and in reducing cost of cultivation. On the other hand, ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions helped enhance groundwater recharge by harvesting an additional 50–150 mm of surface runoff which helped increase crop yields, led to sustainable crop intensification and strengthened the number of ecosystem services. Most of the published literature on in situ conservation measures are studies that were carried out at research stations, which show promise of sustainable intensification. However, greater efforts are needed to document learnings from farmer/community scale interventions for effective scaling up. There is also a gap in data availability that hampers a clear understanding of the impact of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions and ecosystem trade-offs; moreover the data available covers short periods and only covers an area of up to 10 km2. We recommend the monitoring of long-term system-level impact indicators to realize the potential of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions in a systems perspective and better grasp the ecosystem trade-offs. More importantly, the review revealed the ample scope of integrating in situ and ex situ interventions to build system-level resilience in smallholder farming systems in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

    "abstract": "Precision farming (PF) is a term that is now widespread throughout agricultural systems worldwide. It is studied in many ways, from its strictly technical connotation of a farm management strategy that uses information technology to support decision-making processes to the steppingstones and the dissection of the factors involved in the complex scenario of adopting related tools. Starting from the statement \"In my opinion, precision farming is…\", the present work investigates the perspective of the agricultural entrepreneur in conceptualising PF. Some researchers have highlighted the role of the sphere of the self in adoption, but few efforts have been made to better understand the role played by farmers' perceptions in the formation of their thinking about innovative tools. This work aims to deepen the sphere of the self and, in particular, the role played by farmers' perceptions when faced with the innovation adoption choice. The study presents a new conceptual framework identifying key stages for analysing adoption processes, focusing on the relationships between behaviour, structural dimensions and adoption, interpreted from the farmer perspective. The Q methodology (QM) was used with a targeted sample of 23 farmers to identify prevailing discourses. In the first step, the socio-structural dimensions were analysed through descriptive analysis, and in the second step, the discourses were extracted by an intercorrelation matrix through the centroid procedure, translating the solution using varimax rotation. This paper highlights that the QM is an appropriate technique for exploring and studying farmers' attitudes when challenged with innovation. The results reveal discourses that summarise three macro perspectives: the \"proactive approach\", which represents farmers who perceive PF as having a key role for agricultural enterprises; the \"conservative approach\", which characterises those who distrust innovations; and the \"doubtful approach\", which is the more sceptical vision. This study demonstrates the importance of moving beyond simply quantitative studies that methodically analyse adoption processes and overcoming the constraints of qualitative research by employing a mixed approach to identify the common perspectives of farmers. This analysis can be used by policy makers as a new survey tool to make stakeholder consultations more effective, as the 3 approaches may help to enrich the discourse on PF. The results provide new perspectives to promote responsible policies to support the effectiveness of PF.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, the effects of climate change have impacted heavily on the agricultural sector, particularly in developing countries provided their high vulnerability. In this sense, knowledge and information transference could act as a strategic support service to improve the resilience of their farming systems, as this would help farmers to adapt and take advantage of the new scenarios brought by climate change, as well as to take preventive actions. The aim of this study was to understand the structure of the interactions between farmers and institutions of the National Agrarian Innovation System of Peru regarding the transfer of information on preventing the effects of extreme weather events. To do so, we aim to understand how farmers and institutions are connected and how the climatic and farming systems' particularities of the territories, the main roles of the institutions and the media through which farmers get the information from each of them could influence such information transfer processes. The structure of interactions between institutions and farmers is modelled for the period 2016–2019 by means of the Latent Block Modelling clustering algorithm. Given the differences in size, resources and practices between smallholders and large-scale farmers, the relationships between them and the institutions are modelled and analysed separately. This study identifies how actors involved in preventive information transfer in the National Agrarian Innovation System of Peru are connected, quantifies their relevance and detects deficiencies in such transfer processes. Results show that less than 13% of smallholders and 18% of large-scale farmers in Peru are getting this information, which is mainly transferred by the TV and the radio (non-specialized media) and mostly only by one governmental institution. Additionally, we detected some groups of farmers who rely on other institutions too, with regional differences in the access to information. Results suggest that there is room for improvement regarding the transfer of information on preventing extreme weather events. The results obtained and their discussion could be particularly useful to help in the design of policies focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of climatic-related information transfer. In the end, this would help to improve the resilience of Peruvian farmers against climate change and thus, to strengthen the Peruvian agricultural sector.",

In this context, it is important that hydrological processes in the soil-crop system are accurately modelled. We suggest here that empirical treatments of soil water flow, water uptake by plant roots and transpiration limit the applicability of crop models and increase prediction errors. We further argue that this empiricism is to a large extent unnecessary, as parsimonious physics-based descriptions of these water flow processes in the soil-crop system are now available. Recent reviews and opinion articles, whilst strongly advocating the need for improvements to crop models, fail to mention the significant role played by accurate treatments of soil hydrology. It seems to us that empirical models of soil water flow have become the elephant in the room.",

    "abstract": "Farmer-led innovation brings farmers together with other stakeholders in a collaborative endeavour that recognises multiple forms of expertise. Critical engagement with mainstream models of agricultural science and technology (AST) development has drawn attention to the isolation of farmers as technology adopters within a compartmentalised model of AST development and dissemination. Academic, government and non-governmental actors and organisations are increasingly supporting facilitated processes in which farmers, scientists and engineers develop new knowledge, learning together about the nature of the problems being faced and the potential of different solution pathways.Despite the centrality of learning to farmer-led innovation, its role has yet to be systematically explored. In response, this paper looks to understand the forms of learning and their contribution to farmer-led innovation during a three-year action-research project involving two groups of farmers from northern England and the Scottish Borders in the UK.A researcher-facilitator convened a structured process of twenty meetings that together created opportunities for interaction, deliberation and re-framing of problems and solutions among groups of farmers, a university-based engineer, and wider stakeholders. Multiple qualitative methods were used to build understanding of the different farming contexts and to explore the issues the farmers wanted to work on. Meeting transcripts and fieldnotes were subject to thematic analysis, informed by the analytical framework of cognitive, normative and relational learning derived from the social learning literature.Cognitive, normative and relational learning were found to be mutually interdependent and equally significant, building iteratively rather than linearly: the farmers and engineer assessed new information and reappraised existing situations; they did so informed by and informing a shift in understanding of their goals for new technology; and in so doing they relied on and developed the trust and confidence needed to acknowledge or challenge each other's perspectives. By orientating the group engagement process around the space to explore and challenge histories and contexts of AST, and by drawing on social learning principles to facilitate interaction between the different expertise of farmers and between farmers and engineers, learning emerged that interleaved technology co-design with incremental refinement of the shared norms and values embedded in the process itself.A focus on learning helps deepen understanding of key mechanisms and processes that define and deliver innovation, and the findings suggest that priorities for farmer-led innovation process design should focus on modalities that open up spaces to negotiate both the purpose and products of innovation.",

    "abstract": "Crop yields and labour productivity have increased markedly over the past 70 years. In agriculturally advanced countries, increases in labour productivity – that is, increases in the economic output per unit of labour input – have been several-fold greater than corresponding increases in yield. The gap in labour productivity between the Global North and the Global South is now much greater than the yield gap. This large labour productivity gap, unless remedied, will: (i) condemn many farmers in the Global South to live in poverty; and (ii) make them less competitive and force them to follow the well-established trend of exiting farming altogether, which (iii) will contribute to greater dependence on imported food in many countries. Despite this situation, agricultural development agencies tend to emphasise biological yield per unit area to satisfy the increasing demand for more nutritious and varied food products. Policies are skewed towards low-cost food for urbanites, often with benign neglect of the welfare of the rural populace, particularly the women who produce the food. We suggest R&D policies should pay more attention to enhanced labour productivity, while not neglecting increased yield, to meet the dual needs of food for the overall population and prosperity in rural areas. Many technology-based interventions exist to increase labour productivity, nevertheless, single technological fixes are unlikely to bring about major changes. Furthermore, the adoption of new technologies and novel enterprises required to increase labour productivity, particularly those related to high value crops for farmers with limited access to land, depends on an inclusive innovation systems approach. Policies are needed that support the development of new enterprises, soft infrastructure, a stronger industrial base and inclusive partnerships with education providers such as universities, research centres, secondary and tertiary education facilities. This is not to say that producers in the Global South should follow the Global North, rather that policy should focus on interventions that improve labour productivity of both women and men tailored to enhance ongoing development within the local context.",

    "abstract": "Sustainability-Oriented Innovation (SOI) is recognized as a way to address agrifood system sustainability challenges. Because of its complexity, SOI requires inter-organizational collaboration between actors within and around value chains. Since farming practices account for a large part of the environmental impact of food products, farmer involvement in SOI processes is key. However, there is a lack of evidence on the degree of farmer engagement in inter-organizational collaboration, as well as the diversity of partners involved. Moreover, our understanding of the heterogeneity of collaboration in relation to the sustainability dimensions of the innovation SOI processes is limited. The objectives of our research are twofold. First, to propose a novel conceptualization of SOI, converging the sustainability specificities of the innovation process and the characteristics of the collaboration supporting the innovation process. Second, to unpack heterogeneous forms of collaboration in SOI with attention to farmer engagement in these forms. We developed the SOI framework and analyzed SOI processes in the fruit and vegetable sector across Europe. A multiple correspondence statistical analysis was carried out based on data from more than one hundred value chains that have implemented a SOI process. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to reveal patterns of collaboration in SOI. The results show different patterns of collaborative SOI in European fruit and vegetable chains. The SOI differ as regards to three specific dimensions: the diversity, the direction, and the distribution; and they rely on various collaboration forms. Seven clusters are analyzed and discussed, with specific attention to the farmer engagement in the collaboration forms. We differentiated between 1) Intermediary-led farm & food innovation with farmer collaboration; 2) Intermediary-led short food supply chain innovation with farmer collaboration; 3) Processor-led green food product innovation without farmer collaboration; 4) Farmer-led sustainable agricultural practices innovation with a collaborative network; 5) Farmer-led coupled innovation with downstream integration; 6) value chain actor-led coupled innovation with farmer collaboration; 7) Retailer-led distribution innovation without farmer collaboration. The relationship between diverse collaboration forms and SOI dimensions is discussed. Revealing the heterogeneity of collaboration forms in SOI processes is important for developing sound policies. Given the significant role of farmers in sustainable agrifood system transitions, this paper reveals various levels of farmer engagement in collaborative SOI processes in value chains. Results have implications for mission-oriented policies since they allow a more precise and targeted approach to agrifood chains within the broader agrifood system transformation.",

    "abstract": "Sowing dates are currently an essential input for crop models. However, in the future, the optimal sowing time will be affected by climate changes and human adaptations to these changes. A better understanding of what determines the choice of wheat type and sowing dates is required to be able to predict future crop yields reliably. This study was conducted to understand how climate conditions affect the choice of wheat types and sowing dates globally. We develop a model integrating optimality concepts for simulating gross primary production (GPP) with climate constraints on wheat phenology to predict sowing dates. We assume that wheat could be sown at any time with suitable climate conditions and farmers would select a sowing date that maximises yields. The model is run starting on every possible climatically suitable day, determined by climate constraints associated with low temperature and intense precipitation. The optimal sowing date is the day which gives the highest yield in each location. We evaluate the simulated optimal sowing dates with data on observed sowing dates created by merging census-based datasets and local agronomic information, then predict their changes under future climate scenarios to gain insight into the impacts of climate change. Cold-season temperatures are the major determinant of sowing dates in the extra-tropics, whereas the seasonal cycle of monsoon rainfall is important in the tropics. Our model captures the timing of reported sowing dates, with differences of less than one month over much of the world; maximum errors of up to two months occur in tropical regions with large altitudinal gradients. Discrepancies between predictions and observations are larger in tropical regions than temperate and cold regions. Slight warming is shown to promote earlier sowing in wet areas but later in dry areas; larger warming leads to delayed sowing in most regions. These predictions arise due to the interactions of several influences on yield, including the effects of warming on growing-season length, the need for sufficient moisture during key phenological stages, and the temperature threshold for vernalization of winter wheat. The integration of optimality concepts for simulating GPP with climate constraints on phenology provides realistic predictions of wheat type and sowing dates. The model thus provides a basis for predicting how crop calendars might change under future climate change. It can also be used to investigate potential changes in management to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.",

    "abstract": "The escalating sustainability problems of the current agrifood regime call for a radical, systemic transformation. Such a transformation implies a move into a new stability domain, defined by a new set of systemic attractors. These transformations can be conceptualised as regime shifts. In this study, we explored the history of the Finnish agrifood system in order to learn from the past transformations of the system and to inform the current attempts to steer its development in a more sustainable direction. We conducted a qualitative analysis on literature discussing the history of the Finnish agrifood system by utilising the concept of the adaptive cycle, which captures the cyclicity of the evolution of social-ecological systems. We identified six regimes from the 14th century onwards: Expansion (1334–1721), Progressive (1722–1868), Cattle (1869–1918), Premodern (1919–1944), Modernisation (1945–1994) and Globalisation (1995–). During each regime, the evolution of the system organised around specific attractors which initially opened up new possibilities for the actors, but over time, the very same attractors became the main source of vulnerability in the system. Along with the system's maturation, path-dependency created rigidity, escalating sustainability problems and decreasing room for manoeuvre for the system's actors, concomitantly decreasing the system's resilience. When an external shock related to climatic conditions, economic turbulence or wars coincided with such a rigidity, the system collapsed, the consequences of which span from food shortages to large-scale, deadly famines. The collapse of the old regime opened up the window of opportunity for a regime shift. The most profound regime shifts were related to changes in the system's metabolism and trade orientation. While the conservation phase of the adaptive cycle increases systemic vulnerabilities, it also offers an opportunity for systemic transformation. Allowing the adaptive cycle to play out on smaller scales—such as at the level of farm systems—helps to avoid collapse on the scale of the whole food system. The current agrifood regime in Finland indicates strong path-dependency and rigidity, manifesting a conservation phase, to be followed by release and reorganisation. This observation calls, first, for considering the resilience of the current system to anticipate a crisis and, second, for outlining alternative visions for the sustainable future of the agrifood system.",

    "abstract": "Maize-legume intercropping is common in sub-Saharan Africa. Effects of legumes on the companion maize crop are determined principally by choice of legume species and relative introduction time. Performance of intercrops is optimized when legumes' planting is timed such that their peak growth phase occurs after maize harvest, with legumes utilizing the residual soil moisture. We sought to understand the role of inter-specific competition for water in maize-pigeonpea and maize-lablab intercrops. We analysed experimentally determined shoot biomass of sole and intercropped maize, lablab, long and medium- duration pigeonpea. Experiments were conducted in northern Tanzania for two consecutive seasons. The second season was drier (236 mm) than the first (551 mm). We constructed a parameter-sparse growth model, calibrated based on sole crops data. The model calculates growth rate as radiation interception × radiation-use efficiency. When simulated actual soil moisture content fell below a species-specific critical level, the ratio between actual and potential transpiration for that species decreased, and crop growth rate was reduced proportional to this reduction. There was good agreement between simulated and observed shoot biomass of maize and the legumes. With rooting depth of 60 cm, maize was simulated to be sensitive to annual precipitation, resulting in 3.5 t ha−1 (34%) reduction in shoot dry matter production in the second season. By contrast, the legumes, with a rooting depth of 200 cm did not experience water shortage in either of the two seasons, resulting in nearly identical shoot dry matter production in both seasons. Explorative simulations assuming the legumes to have shallower rooting depth confirmed the importance of this trait for avoidance of water stress, with simulated reductions in dry matter production of 23–34% for the legumes when rooting depth was reduced from 200 to 60 cm. Maize in the intercrop was modestly influenced by the legumes due to light competition. In the low precipitation season, additional competition for water occurred and water shortage for maize was aggravated. Maize influenced the legumes only through competition for light, as a tap root allowed the legumes to utilize water stored in deeper soil layers. During the co-growth period, competition for light exerted by maize on the legumes was strong, but they partly compensated for this in the period after maize harvest. Our results emphasize the important role of the deep legume tap root for the success of maize-legume intercrops under rain-fed conditions.",

    "abstract": "Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) aims to address climate change, climate variability, and food security while sustaining productivity. The literature on acceptance and adoption of CSA technologies recognizes the importance of the policy environment in shaping farmers' decisions, particularly the policy mix, including economic, regulatory, and information instruments to stimulate CSA acceptance. Behavioral models have been used to better explain CSA acceptance, however, only a few studies integrate farmers' behavioral drivers and their policy mix appraisal, which in combination, are important determinants for the successful acceptance of CSA. This paper proposes a model that integrates behavioral drivers and policy mix appraisal influencing the acceptance of CSA technologies. We aim to examine how farmers' behavioral drivers and their appraisal of the policy environment influence the acceptance of CSA technologies and practices. We studied the Costa Rican coffee sector and conducted 523 surveys with coffee farmers and two focus groups with experts, extension agents, and cooperatives. An ordered probit model was used to identify factors explaining CSA acceptance. The results indicate that besides the influence of behavioral drivers, policy consistency and comprehensiveness and the type of instrument targeting farmers' behaviors play an important role in explaining CSA acceptance. Our results suggest that a positive appraisal of policy consistency and comprehensiveness are important for increasing farmers' acceptance of CSA and sustainable practices. This deepens earlier thinking on \"policy packages\" effectiveness by showing that the farmers' appraisal of the overall policy mix influences their decisions to engage with CSA. Our study shows the importance of considering system context effects (policy environment) on farmers' decision-making. Since the integration of behavioral drivers and the appraisal of the policy mix characteristics is relatively underexplored for CSA, our empirical results may help to unravel farmers' decision-making processes. Thus, it can be used for rethinking and adjusting policy interventions toward more balanced and comprehensive policy mixes, as it enables feedback from policy implementation and can further induce policy learning.",

This study assessed the productivity and environmental impacts of a sample of seven cattle-oriented production systems: an agricultural rewilding system (biodiversity-friendly, in England), three suckler beef systems (two of them considered biodiversity-friendly, in France) and three dairy systems (one biodiversity-friendly and one conventional, in France). Life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to assess six environmental impacts (i.e. terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, land occupation, and in particular, climate change and energy demand) and was combined with calculation of EROI. Per hectare of land occupied to produce livestock and their feed, production of human-edible animal protein and environmental impacts of these systems increased as energy demand (i.e. input use) increased. Per hectare, human-edible animal protein production, energy demand and climate change impact (considering carbon dynamics) ranged from 5 kg, 90 MJ and −5.5 t CO2-eq., respectively, for the agricultural rewilding system to 239 kg, 20,496 MJ and 8.3 t CO2-eq., respectively, for the conventional French dairy farm. Patterns of trade-offs varied among the production strategies of the farms. The four biodiversity-friendly farms in the sample had low productivity but also low environmental impacts per ha, especially for climate change and energy demand, due to being extensive systems with relatively high self-sufficiency. Biodiversity-friendly farms also had higher EROI than other farms that produced the same products. Using LCA to assess biodiversity-friendly systems, in particular agricultural rewilding, challenges its ability to consider natural baseline emissions and non-provisioning ecosystem services. These results emphasise the need to consider the multiple functions of these systems and their overall environmental performances and sustainability. Current economic and social trends may provide opportunities for biodiversity-friendly livestock systems as a possible future for livestock systems.",

    "abstract": "Rapid economic development in East Africa is matched by extremely dynamic smallholder livelihoods. To quantify the changes in poverty of smallholder farmers, to evaluate the potential of farm and off-farm activities to alleviate poverty, and to evaluate the potential barriers to poverty alleviation. The analyses were based on a panel survey of 600 households undertaken in 2012 and re-visited approximately four years later in four sites in East Africa. The sites represented contrasting smallholder farming systems, linked to urban centres undergoing rapid economic and social change (Nairobi, Kampala, Kisumu, and Dar-es-Salaam). The surveys assessed farm management, farm productivity, livelihoods, and various measures of household welfare. Almost two thirds of households rose above or fell below meaningful poverty thresholds – more than previously measured in this context – but overall poverty rates remained constant. Enhanced farm value production and off-farm income proved to be important mechanisms to rise out of poverty for households that were already resource-endowed. However, households in the poorest stratum in both panels appeared to be stuck in a poverty trap. They owned significantly fewer productive assets in the first panel compared to other groups (land and livestock), and these baseline assets were found to be positively correlated with farm income in the second panel survey. Equally these households were also found to be among the least educated, while education was found to be an important enabling factor for the generation of high value off-farm income. Rural development that aims to stimulate increases in farm produce value as a means to alleviate poverty are only viable for already resource-endowed households, as they have the capacity to enhance farm value production. Conversely, the alleviation of extreme poverty should focus on different means, perhaps cash transfers, or the development of more sophisticated social safety nets. Furthermore, while off-farm income presents another important mechanism for poverty alleviation in rural areas, these opportunities are restricted to those households that have had access to education. As more households turn to off-farm activities to supplement or replace their livelihoods, farming approaches will also change affecting the management of natural resources. These dynamics ought to be better understood to better manage land-use transitions.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people living in the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) of India engage in agriculture to support their livelihoods yet are income poor, and food and climate insecure. To address these challenges, policymakers and development programs invest in irrigation-led agricultural intensification. However, the evidence for agricultural intensification to lift farmers' incomes above the poverty line remains largely anecdotal. The main objective of this study is to use a large household survey (n = 15,572; rice: 8244, wheat: 7328; 2017/18) to assess the link between agricultural intensification and personal daily incomes from farming (FPDI) in the rice-wheat systems of the EGP – the dominant cropping system of the region. We use the Intensification Benefit Index (IBI), a measure that relates farm size and household size to FPDI, to assess how daily incomes from rice-wheat production change with irrigation-led intensification across the EGP. Relative to the international poverty line of 1.90 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)$ day−1 and accounting for variations in HH size in the analysis, we found that small farm sizes limit the potential for agricultural intensification from irrigation to transform the poverty status of households in the bottom three quartiles of the IBI. The estimated median FPDI of households with intensified systems in the bottom three quartiles is only 0.51 PPP$ day−1 (a 0.15 PPP$ gain). The median FPDI increases to 2.10 PPP$ day−1 for households in the upper quartile of the IBI distribution (a 0.30 PPP$ gain). Irrigation-led agricultural intensification of rice-wheat systems in the EGP may provide substantial benefits for resilience to climatic change and food security but achieving meaningful poverty reduction will require complementary investments. Transforming the poverty status of most smallholder farmers in the EGP requires diversified portfolios of rural on- and off-farm income-generating opportunities. While bolstering food- and climate security, agronomic intervention programs should consider smallholders' limited monetary incentives to invest in intensification. Irrigation-led agricultural intensification programs and policies should explicitly account for the heterogeneity in household resources, irrigation levels, and degree of dependence on agricultural income.",

    "abstract": "Climate change mitigation in the agricultural sector is a key policy goal. Marginal abatement cost curves allow comparing the cost-effectiveness of agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation measures. Existing studies often do not account for the heterogeneity of farms and interactions between mitigation measures. The objective of this study is to present a new approach that allows the calculation of a marginal abatement cost curve that considers farm level interaction effects of climate change mitigation measures. We assess the influence of farm structural heterogeneity on the greenhouse gas abatement potential and the corresponding abatement costs when measures are implemented jointly on the farm level. We use the bio-economic farm model FarmDyn to simulate farm-specific abatement potential and mitigation costs for a set of mixed dairy farms in a Swiss case study region (n = 66) and develop an approach to calculate a bottom-up, marginal abatement cost curve based on our sample of farms. Simulation results are used to identify and quantify the effect of heterogeneous farm structures (e.g., size, land use, etc.) on the interactions of climate change mitigation measures using regression analysis. In our study, interaction effects reduce marginal abatement costs by 7% and the overall greenhouse gas abatement potential by 3% compared to a stand-alone consideration of four climate change mitigation measures. Our analysis of how the underlying farm structures affect interaction effects between climate change mitigation measures shows that complex processes on the farm level can have ambiguous effects (i.e., increasing or decreasing greenhouse gas emissions). We conclude that our approach can provide important knowledge about how heterogeneity affects marginal abatement costs when mitigation measures interact with each other. Knowledge about the effectiveness and efficiency of climate change mitigation measures and their interaction effects improves our understanding and development of bottom-up marginal abatement cost curves, which represent an important and widely used tool to inform policymakers and stakeholders on cost-efficient and cost-effective climate change mitigation in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Circular agriculture is increasingly seen as a way to produce food while respecting planetary boundaries. The buzz around circular agriculture results in a wide variety of initiatives and experiments aimed at implementing circularity in practice. So far, no studies provide a systematic overview of ways in which circularity is implemented in practice and the associated transformative potential. The aim of this study, therefore, is to analyse the transformative potential of circular agriculture initiatives within a regional context. In this study, we will address the following research questions: (1) which circular initiatives exist within the region, (2) to what extent do initiatives show transformative potential towards circular agriculture? We created a systematic inventory of circular agricultural initiatives on a regional scale, alongside with a systematic empirical application of the framework, which builds on the concept of small wins and puts forward five concrete characteristics for transformative circular agriculture initiatives. We identified 171 circular agriculture initiatives in the North of the Netherlands and subsequently analysed 29 of these to determine their transformative potential. The largest share of the 171 initiatives consists of primary producers, in particular dairy farmers. The in-depth analysis of 29 initiatives resulted in the following insights: many initiatives showed incremental, primarily technological changes and operate within the boundaries of the current system. Initiatives that show a higher transformative potential concerning the depth of change (or more 'radical change') are also likely to score higher on other dimensions of the framework (concrete outcomes, integration of circular agriculture principles, overcoming barriers, synergy technological and social change. We therefore endorse the importance of recognizing the initiatives with strong transformative potential and prevent that the implementation of circular agriculture remains focused on merely optimization within the current system while more fundamental changes are needed to address the sustainability challenges. The results give insight into characteristics and transformative potential of circular agriculture initiatives which can help to identify where targeted interventions could be implemented to enhance the transformation. Our approach is thereby suitable to analyse the transformative potential of circular agriculture initiatives in other regions and can also be used to analyse the implementation of other sustainability ambitions.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Despite a steady increase in staple crop yields over the past ten years, current agricultural production must escalate even more to keep pace with the expected world population growth, which in turn will require improved agricultural methods that are adapted to many environmental pressures. Comprehensive models that can simulate crop production systems and the impact of management and conservation practices on natural resources and the environment, including water quality at large scale present important contributions to this challenge. OBJECTIVE: To this end we developed the National Agroecosystem Model (NAM): a comprehensive model that uses the updated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) to accurately simulate staple crop yields across the contiguous United States (CONUS), with an initial focus on Corn (Zea mays L.) and Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) yields. METHODS: Available open-access data was used to setup this high-resolution modeling system, where every 8-digit hydrologic unit (HUC8) is represented as an individual SWAT+ simulation. A total of 2201 HUC8 simulations across the CONUS were interconnected from upstream to downstream to make the NAM. Field boundary data was used to setup the NAM in such a way that every identified cultivated field is modeled as a unique Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU). Simulated corn and soybean yield from over 2.5 million field-type HRUs were compared to reported average annual corn and soybean yields for the respective area for the 2015–2020 period. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show a good agreement between simulated and reported yields (R2 = 0.90 for corn and R2 = 0.70 for soybeans), with a very good model performance in the high corn and soybean production region of the US Corn Belt (Relative Error < ±5%). SIGNIFICANCE: Apart from assessing the capability of the updated SWAT+ model, we also demonstrate the new crop yield calibration module embedded in SWAT+, highlight changes to the plant growth module, and model parameterization. Results of an analysis of possible crop production differences for corn and soybeans in irrigated, tiled, and non-irrigated-non-tiled fields are also discussed. The versatility of the NAM provides the possibility to analyze information on impacts of changing conservation practices and enables identification of conservation gains and remaining conservation needs at the national scale.",

    "abstract": "Smallholders account for ca. 40% of oil palm area in Indonesia but average yield remains low. Despite higher overall fertilizer use in Indonesia compared with other Southeast Asian countries, poor plant nutrition has been identified as a major factor explaining yield gaps in smallholder oil palm fields and little is known about the underlying management drivers. To assess nutrient management in smallholder fields and identify entry points to narrow the existing yield gap via improved plant nutrition. We assessed nutrient balances and gaps for nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) and inter-relationships between fertilizer use, leaf nutrient concentration, and yield, using data collected from 977 smallholder fields in Indonesia over two years. There was a positive relationship between yield and nutrient rates, especially for potassium (K). Only half of the fields received fertilizer and average nutrient rates in fertilized fields represented 45% (N), 83% (P), 28% (K), and 25% (Mg) of the associated removal with harvested yield. Applied fertilizer was generally rich in N and P, but poor in K and Mg, leading to nutrient imbalances. Additionally, farmers did not follow appropriate practices on fertilizer placement and splits. Improving current fertilizer supply and management is needed to increase smallholder yields and profit. Current agricultural and research programs will benefit from re-orienting efforts to improve nutrient management in oil palm as a pathway to narrow yield gaps in smallholder fields, which, in turn, requires strengthening extension services to fill in knowledge gaps and tune subsidy programs to facilitate farmer access to fertilizer sources more suited to the crop.",

    "abstract": "Complexity has long been recognised as a key feature of agri-food systems. Yet, it remains largely theoretical or poorly addressed in practice, hampering the potential of international development projects to address agriculture and food-related challenges in the Global South. The paper identifies and examines six sources of complexity that can manifest in projects, namely: unpredictability; path dependencies; context-specific dynamics; power relations; multiple temporal and spatial scales. It then proposes and tests six agri-food system principles that could be drawn upon to more successfully navigate this complexity. The aim of the paper is to illustrate how these principles could help projects respond to the changing circumstances and unpredictable turns of agri-food systems contexts in a different way, which flexibly embraces complexity. This flexibility is essential in an age of uncertainty and transformation. Comparative case study analysis of six projects implemented by the CGIAR: aflatoxin control in groundnuts in Malawi (1), pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa (2), sorghum beer in Kenya (3), sweet sorghum for biofuel in India (4), precooked beans in Uganda and Kenya (5), Smart Foods in India and Eastern Africa (6). The projects aimed to either increasing smallholder farmers' incomes or addressing food and nutrition security, or both. They were specifically selected as all they were affected by some of the sources of complexity, which hampered the projects to different extents. This makes the cases relevant for not only illustrating manifestations of complexity, but also help reflect on alternative strategies to tackle it. The analysis of the case studies reveals how complexity can frustrate objectives of development interventions under several aspects. It also serves to discuss how complexity can be more successfully navigated (within but also beyond the selected cases) by applying the set of proposed agri-food system principles. The principles are also presented as ways future interventions could avoid clinging to what is \"known to work\" and instead venture into more powerful pathways of change. The following complexity-aware principle are proposed: Welcome surprises and openly discuss trade-offs; Shun orthodoxies; Engage with context-specificity; Expose patterns of power; Embrace the lengthy nature of change; Understand the multi-scale (in terms of space and time) nature of agri-food systems contexts. These principles could be used by project designers and implementors to cope with the complexity and uncertainty that will inevitably be encountered in agri-food system interventions, and can no longer be ignored.",

    "abstract": "In the pursuit of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, integrating agriculture-forestry-livestock (AFL) systems has emerged as a potential tool in developing countries. Yet, the extent of synergies and trade-offs associated with each SDG and viable strategies to address these trade-offs and leverage the synergies lack clarity. The objective of this study is to investigate the synergies and trade-offs associated with integrating AFL practices in Bangladesh toward achieving the 17 SDGs and suggest appropriate solutions to address the trade-offs. This study employs an online survey based on the Delphi principles, ensuring unbiased opinions from a diverse set of experts with relevant expertise in the AFL nexus. The first survey round gathers insights on potential synergies and trade-offs, and the second round focuses on effective management strategies to address the challenges. Findings reveal that AFL integration holds potential for synergies across SDGs, especially for poverty eradication, zero hunger, life on land, and climate action. However, trade-offs develop due to a lack of technical expertise and managerial knowledge, limited access to financial resources, fragmented land ownership, insufficient market opportunities, existing gender inequities, child labor practices, and an overreliance on wood as a fuel source in Bangladesh. To address these challenges, this study recommends comprehensive strategies such as creating specialized agricultural credit facilities, introducing insurance schemes, promoting cooperative associations, resolving land ownership issues, improving market linkages, addressing child labor, promoting gender equality, and advocating for clean energy alternatives like biogas. These strategies are linked with several national agendas of Bangladesh and aim to minimize trade-offs and maximize the synergies of AFL integration for sustainable development. This research contributes to the global discourse on sustainable development by shedding light on the potential of AFL systems in Bangladesh and offers insights for policymakers and stakeholders. The findings also provide guidance for other developing countries facing similar challenges while pursuing the SDGs.",

    "abstract": "Small woody features (SWF), as field boundaries, hedgerows, or riparian buffers, are crucial for agricultural landscapes and, frequently, disregarded. In combination with agricultural land uses they are considered agroforestry systems (AFSWF), but their spatial distribution and detailed location of SWF types are insufficiently known in the EU as to support agricultural policies or enhance the development of farming practices for biodiversity conservation or productivity management. In addressing this, the LUCAS 2015 dataset was analysed across EU member states to identify, characterise, and determine the extent and distribution of AFSWF classes and the variety of SWF types in agricultural lands. Additionally, a comparison between AFSWF and common agroforestry systems (AFC), such as silvopastoral, silvoarable, grazed or intercropped permanent crops, and kitchen gardens was conducted. To achieve this, four categories of AFSWF were established based on the classes of land cover within agricultural areas where SWF are present: arable crops AFSWF, grazed grasslands AFSWF, ungrazed grasslands AFSWF, and permanent crops AFSWF. The typology and relevance of the AFSWF categories and the SWF types were analysed and mapped at country level and by biogeographical regions. The spatial distribution of AFSWF and the different types of SWF were analysed using density maps. Results reveal that AFSWF cover 443,770 km2 (10% of the EU-28 and 25% of the utilised agricultural area). This area encompasses arable crops (44%), ungrazed grasslands (24%), grazed grasslands (23%), and permanent crops (8%). The extent of AFSWF is 3.3 times larger than AFC (132,317 km2), being mainly concentrated in Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Denmark, and Germany, while AFC prevail in the Mediterranean. As regards to SWF types, both managed and unmanaged hedgerows were dominant in France, Great Britain, and Ireland. Heaths and shrubs in Spain and Germany. Grove and woodlands margins in Spain, while avenue trees were dominant in Germany. Single trees and conifer hedges, the less prevalent SWF types, were broadly distributed. This pioneering research addresses a knowledge gap, thoroughly documenting AFSWF, revealing both its types and spatial distribution. The findings highlight substantial disparities in AFSWF prevalence among member states of the EU. The study compares AFSWF with AFC in relevance and distribution, significantly contributing to better understanding agroforestry systems and offering baselines for future monitoring and management. Findings advocate for policy incentives and increased awareness among farmers to foster the understanding of the impacts of SWF on productivity and biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinization is a significant environmental challenge prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions, causing adverse effects on crop yields and jeopardizing household food security. Previous research has examined the influence of institutional dynamics and the adoption of sustainable land management practices in bolstering agricultural output, and some have investigated the interplay among socioeconomic determinants, institutional frameworks, and the uptake of climate-resilient and sustainable methodologies, or the association between soil health and agricultural productivity. Yet, there has been a lack of studies that considered this relationship altogether and their role in enhancing soil fertility. We investigate the relationship among socioeconomic and institutional factors, adoption of sustainable land management practices, and the resulting changes in soil fertility between 2016 and 2019 within the context of mixed crop-livestock farms in the three irrigated agroecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan. A household survey was conducted in 2019 to complement soil attributes data collected by the Government of Punjab in 2016. Households that implemented sustainable land management practices between 2016 and 2019 were analysed to investigate the effect of various factors on soil fertility, including the adoption of sustainable land management practices and their influence on soil fertility dynamics. A structural equation model was employed to examine the relationship among exogenous variables, moderating variables, and endogenous variables, to explain their collective influence on soil fertility between the two periods. The key findings highlight the significant role of institutional factors, including access to formal information channels such as extension services, demonstration trials, and credit facilities, alongside secure land rights, in predicting the adoption of sustainable land management practices such as gypsum application, laser land leveling, farmyard manuring, and agroforestry. Furthermore, specific SLM practices, particularly agroforestry featuring intercropping with Acacia spp. and farmyard manure application, exhibited positive impacts on change in soil organic matter, albeit with agroforestry showing a negative influence on soil phosphorus levels. The adoption of gypsum and LLL displayed positive effects on soil phosphorus levels over time, contrasting with LLL's adverse impact on soil organic matter. Our findings suggest that soil fertility benefits from policies enacted through public-private partnerships that lead to improved access to sustainable land management information, reduced credit barriers, establishment of local soil testing facilities, and expedited land entitlement processes. These findings highlight the critical role of collaborative partnerships and institutional arrangements in enhancing agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Each year public and private sector maize breeding programs in Kenya deliver high-yielding hybrids that are resistant to drought, pests, and diseases. Yet, most Kenyan maize farmers purchase older, well-known hybrids. While the 'varietal turnover' problem is well known, few solutions have emerged. The potential for seed companies and retailers to influence farmers' product selection towards new products remains an open question. In-store marketing that induces farmers to experiment with new products may be a scalable and cost-effective way to advance seed systems development. Our controlled field experiment with 600 farmers in Kenya comprised a mock agrodealer store stocked with locally available hybrids, where half the farmers who participated faced an out-of-stock situation for their preferred product. The influence of price promotions and product performance information on farmers' seed choice were assessed. When a participant's preferred product was available, performance information and discounts had no effect on decisions. However, when the preferred product was unavailable, the treatments had limited effects on product selection. Prior experience and brand loyalty stood out as the strongest predictors of seed product selection. Our work explored the potential for two interventions—information and price discounts—to influence farmers' product selection. While these interventions showed limited influence on selection, the study design provides a clear starting point for future related experiments. More public and private investments are required to generate timely, comparable, and reliable information on seed performance. The strong effect of brand loyalty favors larger-sized seed companies with sizable marketing budgets.",

Simulated treatments included combinations of three increased temperature regimes (+ 1·5, + 2·5 and + 5·0°C), and estimates of the impact of three levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (440, 530, and 600 ppm) in addition to control runs representing current climatic conditions. Adaptive planting dates of −28, −14, + 14 and + 28 days were included in the potato simulations for current and increased temperature regimes. Twenty-two sites were simulated for citrus yields and 12 sites for potato, using climate records from 1951 to 1980. Response surfaces were developed for all combinations of increased temperature and CO2. Results of citrus simulations without CO2-induced yield improvement indicate that production may shift slightly northward in the southern states, but yields may decline in southern Florida and Texas due to excessive heat during the winter. CO2 effects tended to counteract the decline in simulated citrus yields. Fall potato production under current management practices appears vulnerable to an increase in temperature in the northern states; increased CO2 and changes in planting date were estimated to have minimal compensating impacts on simulated potato yields.",

    "abstract": "CCAFS-MOT is a tool to support farmers, policy advisors and agricultural extension services on the choice of management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) without risking food security. It is an Excel-based tool which brings together several empirical models to estimate GHG emissions in rice, cropland and livestock systems, and provides information about the most effective mitigation options. Greenhouse gas emissions are estimated in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare (kg CO2eq ha− 1) and carbon dioxide equivalent per unit of product (kg CO2eq kg− 1). Baseline management practices are chosen by the user and a set of mitigation options are ranked according to their mitigation potential. The tool allows different levels of input to be specified from an introductory to detailed level, depending on objectives and issues like to accommodate users with different backgrounds and details concerning input data. As such it allows for product and region specific assessments of GHGs and mitigation potentials to be made without the need for expert knowledge or for lengthy model set-up and calibration.",

    "abstract": "Weather observations are essential for crop monitoring and forecasting but they are not always available and in some cases they have limited spatial representativeness. Thus, reanalyses represent an alternative source of information to be explored. In this study, we assess the feasibility of reanalysis-based crop monitoring and forecasting by using the system developed and maintained by the European Commission- Joint Research Centre, its gridded daily meteorological observations, the biased-corrected reanalysis AgMERRA and the ERA-Interim reanalysis. We focus on Europe and on two crops, wheat and maize, in the period 1980–2010 under potential and water-limited conditions. In terms of inter-annual yield correlation at the country scale, the reanalysis-driven systems show a very good performance for both wheat and maize (with correlation values higher than 0.6 in almost all EU28 countries) when compared to the observations-driven system. However, significant yield biases affect both crops. All simulations show similar correlations with respect to the FAO reported yield time series. These findings support the integration of reanalyses in current crop monitoring and forecasting systems and point to the emerging opportunities linked to the coming availability of higher-resolution reanalysis updated at near real time.",

    "abstract": "Rainfed rice production needs to contribute more to the current and future world food security due to the increasing competition for limited water supplies including irrigation water. However, it is vulnerable to climate variabilities and extremes hence the utilization of climate predictions is crucial. In this study, the predictive accuracy and applicability of a seasonal climate predictions (SINTEX-F) were evaluated for rainfed rice areas where climate uncertainties are main constraints for a stable and high production. Outputs from SINTEX-F such as daily rainfall, maximum and minimum air temperatures, and wind speed were tested for Indonesia and Lao PDR through the cumulative distribution function-based downscaling method (CDFDM), which is a simple, flexible and inexpensive bias reduction method through removing bias from the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the GCM outputs. The CDFDM outputs were compared with historical weather data. Obtained results showed that discrepancies between SINTEX-F and the historical weather data were significantly reduced through CDFDM for both sites. ORYZA, an ecophysiological rice growth model that simulate agroecological rice growth processes, was used to evaluate the applicability of the SINTEX-F for grain yield predictions. Obtained results from on-farm field validation showed that the predicted grain yield was close to the actual grain yield that was obtained through optimum sowing timing given by the predictions. A normalized root mean square error between predicted and actual grain yield showed satisfactory model fit in predictions. This implies that SINTEX-F was applicable for improving rainfed rice production through CDFDM. However, CDFDM has a limitation in orographic precipitation, the high-resolution daily weather data or a sophisticated special interpolation method should be considered in order to improve the representation of the geographical pattern for the parameters derived from CDFDM.",

    "abstract": "Demand for dairy products in sub-Saharan Africa, is expected to triple by 2050, while limited increase in supply is predicted. This poses significant food security risk to low income households. Understanding how the dairy food system operates is essential to identify mitigation measures to food insecurity impact. This study aims to determine the structure and functionality of Nairobi's dairy system using a value chain mapping approach. Primary data were gathered through focus group discussions and key informant interviews with dairy value chain stakeholders in Nairobi to obtain qualitative information on people and products in the chains while describing their interactions and flows. Qualitative thematic analysis combined with flowcharts created by participants enabled identification of key food system segments and the development of chain profiles (or flow-diagrams) which together form Nairobi's dairy system. Seven chain profiles forming Nairobi's dairy value chain were identified. These were found to be dominated by small-scale individuals who operate largely independently. Our profiles for the urban and peri-urban farming systems were structurally similar in their downstream networks, obtaining inputs from similar sources. Upstream, the urban systems were shorter, supplying mostly to immediate neighbours or based on own consumption, while the peri urban systems supplied to a wider network and showed some affiliations to producers' associations. Two distinct profiles characterize the milk flow from traders belonging either to a Dairy Traders Association (DTA) or those not belonging to this association (non-DTA). DTA traders sell mainly to fixed retailers and non-DTA traders to mobile retailers (hawkers or roadside vendors). Profiles associated with medium and large cooperatives were driven by networks of collection centres, but with medium-sized cooperatives selling half of their production to large processing companies, and large cooperatives only to fixed retailers. Large processing companies' profiles indicated distribution of high volumes and value addition processing. They reported strategic milk collection arrangements with suppliers on long, medium - or short - term contracts and with well-established product distribution channels. We have identified numerous inter-linkages across dairy chain profiles in Nairobi's complex system, demonstrating significant interdependency among the stakeholders. Therefore, enhancing the system's efficiency requires a holistic, system-wide approach and any policy interventions should consider every segment of the value chain. This study provides a methodological approach for organizations and policy makers to understand and address structural and functional vulnerabilities within food systems more broadly. The insights from this study are relevant to other rapidly growing cities in the region.",

    "abstract": "Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa earn a substantial part of their living from rain-fed smallholder agriculture, which is highly sensitive to climate change. There is a growing number of multi-level assessments on impacts and adaptation options for African smallholder systems under climate change, yet few studies translate impacts at the individual crop level to vulnerability at the household level, at which other livelihood activities need to be considered. Further, these assessments often use representative household types rather than considering the diversity of households for the identification of larger-scale patterns at sub-national and national levels. We developed a framework that combines crop suitability maps with a household food availability analysis to quantify household vulnerability to climate-related impacts on crop production and effects of adaptation options. The framework was tested for Uganda, identifying four hotspots of household vulnerability across the country. Hotspots were visually identified as areas with a relatively high concentration of vulnerable households, experiencing a decline in household crop suitability. About 30% of the households in the hotspots in (central) southwest were vulnerable to a combination of 3 °C temperature increase and 10% rainfall decline through declining suitability for several key crops (including highland banana, cassava, maize and sorghum). In contrast only 10% of the households in West Nile and central northern Uganda were negatively affected, and these were mainly affected by declining suitability of common beans. Households that depended on common beans and lived at lower elevations in West Nile and central north were vulnerable to a 2 to 3 °C temperature increase, while households located at higher elevations (above 1100–2000 m.a.s.l. depending on the crop) benefited from such an increase. Options for adaptation to increasing temperatures were most beneficial in northern Uganda, while drought-related adaptation options were more beneficial in the southwest. This framework provides a basis for decision makers who need information on where the vulnerable households are, what crops drive the vulnerability at household level and which intervention efforts are most beneficial in which regions.",

    "abstract": "Growing empirical evidence suggests that innovation platforms can be effective in enhancing agricultural research impact by creating an enabling environment for scaling of innovations such as novel technologies, practices and busines models . However, efforts to understand how these innovation platforms operate to scale innovations are insufficient. Such knowledge is critical for improving the design of agricultural innovation systems, specifically within the context of a rising interest in the innovation platform approach to support the transformation of agriculture across Africa. This paper investigates the scaling approaches employed by innovation platforms established in Rwanda. The study focused on four innovation platforms created as part of the Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Program and analysed their activities and the resulting scaling outcomes. The findings show that two approaches can be effectively combined during the intervention; (1) the innovation process that resembles a traditional, linear approach of finding short-term solutions to specific problems (push approach) and (2) the network building process where platforms employed multi-level, transdisciplinary processes (pull approach). In two areas, the platform activities appeared to have contributed to increased revenues of farmers. The alignment of the innovation platform activities with political agendas or broadly, the extent to which the scaling strategy considers the existing conducive context is shown to play a critical role in the scaling process. The study shows that a balanced combination of both push and pull approaches and a strategic linkage between the platform activities and external development – government policies and interventions – are critical for a productive agricultural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also indicate that the scaling processes require a \"protected space\" to materialise, and the scaling approach needs flexibility to accommodate the complexity of each innovation.",

    "abstract": "Land fragmentation is widespread in traditional field systems of the Mediterranean region. A typical case for high fragmented properties is the Valley of Ricote. It is dominated by smallholder agriculture. To promote smart sustainable development in rural areas it is important to address the specific needs of these small agricultural producers; especially considering that agriculture is the most important consumer of water worldwide and that the great majority of farms are small production units extending over <2 ha. Indeed, high land fragmentation, resulting from traditional land inheritance and transmission systems, may cause loss of water and productive land, entropic governance and superfluous emissions. In particular, drip-irrigated systems suffer from higher costs for irrigation due to high land fragmentation. In this study, we develop a Fragmentation Index for Drip Irrigation and Distance Assessment (FIDIDA) using Geographic Information Systems. FIDIDA quantifies farms considering their transaction costs. Based on these costs, FIDIDA brings together mean plot size, degree of separation and degree of dispersion of land parcels on farm level. The index can be used to compare the individual fragmentation of farms or the land fragmentation between different study areas. The definition of FIDIDA aims at supporting the management of reasonable land fragmentation thresholds in the context of communities made of traditional small farms, while suggesting possible pathways for a gradual inversion of high land fragmentation trends through agreed plot fusion where necessary.",

This paper outlines how the agro-meteorological analyses, country-specific overviews of crop conditions, and crop yield forecasts reported in the Bulletin are used and how these respond to the diverse needs of different types of stakeholders. Stakeholders from more than 32 countries download the JRC MARS Bulletin, in peak-season up to 1500 downloads occur in the first days after publication. The readership of the Bulletin is diverse, coming from governments (e.g. Ministries of Agriculture), private companies (e.g. commodity traders, banking), media, and research and academia. On the list of stakeholders that want to be notified of the release of the Bulletin, roughly 37% originate from business, 35% from research and development, 22% from government, and 6% from the media. The primary user is the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG-AGRI) of the European Commission, which uses the forecasts to quantify the production estimates for crop supply balance sheets and to identify regions with exceptional (mostly weather related) challenges that might require a policy response. The information for wheat, maize and rice is shared through the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) thus contributing to increased global market transparency and better governance of agriculture and food policies. The largest business use is in market information, financial, and consultancy services, followed by commodity trading. Examples of use in media reports as well as online feedback to those, e.g. by farmer's organizations, are also presented. Downloads of the Bulletin peak in the month before harvest at the time when the forecasts can be of most value for stakeholder decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Agroecological practices have been shown to control erosion, increase soil fertility, carbon stocks, pollination and biodiversity. As a consequence, these ecosystem services can contribute to a better farm economic resilience on the long-term; however, empirical evidence is scarce. In this study we aim to understand the economic performance of agroecological practices in almond orchards and the relevance of different economic and policy scenarios to incentivise the upscaling of agroecological practices. We investigated the development of the net present value (NPV) of several agroecological practices (no tillage (NT), green manure (GM) and compost (CM)) as compared to conventional tillage (CT), as well as the effect of internalising externalities through payments for soil carbon sequestration and by costs of erosion. Finally, we explored the effects of price premiums and public greening payments, on farm NPV. We found that all management regimes were profitable and that CM had a 17.2% higher NPV than CT, while both GM and NT had lower NPV than CT (69% for GM and 90.1% for NT). We found that despite NT and GM have higher soil organic carbon stocks, these provided a negligible additional income via carbon markets. CT had the highest externality costs of erosion but still its NPV was higher than NT and GM, despite the strong reductions in costs of erosion in NT and GM conferred by vegetation covers. We found that a price premium of 45% was necessary to make NT's economic performance comparable to that of CT, while a 27% price premium would be needed to make GM comparable to CT. Compensation through public greening payments would be in the order of €644 ha−1 y−1 for NT and €387 ha−1 y−1 for GM to have a similar NPV as CT. Our results suggest a trade-off between income from yield and costs from unaccounted externalities. We also find that private and public policy incentives could reverse this outcome, but requiring a large investment. Of the analysed agroecological practices, compost application appears the most promising to be scaled-up to improve both economic and environmental performance, and further research is needed to determine the outcomes of a combination of compost and vegetation covers.",

    "abstract": "Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is one of the world's most important agricultural commodity crops with the largest share of global production concentrated in West Africa. Current on-farm yields in this region are low and are expected to decrease in response to climate change, through warming and shifts in rainfall. Interventions intended to improve yields and climate adaptation require an understanding of the main drivers of yields across farms. In this regard, we quantified the extent to which environmental (i.e., climate and soil) conditions drive cocoa yields and how this differs for farms achieving on average low- and high mean production levels based on an unprecedented dataset of 3827 cocoa farms spanning the environmental gradients of Ghana. We further quantified the relative importance of management practices based on a subset of 134 farms for which management information was available. We modelled on-farm annual cocoa yield as a function of environmental variables for the large dataset and cocoa yield per tree as a function of environmental and management variables for the subset farms using mixed-effects models. Differences in effects on yield between farms with low and high mean production levels were evaluated using quantile mixed-effects models. There was considerable variability in yields across farms, ranging from ~100 to >1000 kg ha−1 (mean = 554 kg ha−1). Mixed-effects models showed that the fixed effects (i.e., environmental variables) only explained 7% of the variability in yields whilst fixed and random effects together explained 80%, suggesting that farm-to-farm variation played a large role. Explained variation in cocoa yields per tree of 134 farms in the subset increased from 10% to 25% when including management variables in addition to environmental variables. In both models, climate-related factors had a larger effect on yields than edaphic factors, with radiation of the main dry season and that of the previous year having the strongest effects on on-farm- and tree yields, respectively. The quantile regression analyses showed that productivity in high-yielding farms (90th percentile) was more strongly driven by environmental factors than in low-yielding farms (10th percentile). In conclusion, agronomic management is the dominant determinant of on-farm cocoa yields in Ghana, more so than environmental conditions. Furthermore, high-yielding cocoa farms are more sensitive to environmental conditions than low-yielding ones. Our findings suggests that good agricultural practices need to be in place before investing in additional climate adaptation practices.",

    "abstract": "Against a background of unprecedented climate change, humanity faces the challenge of how to increase global food production without compromising the natural environment. Crop suitability models can indicate the best locations to grow different crops and, in doing so, support efficient use of land to leave space for, or share space with, nature. However, challenges in downscaling the climate data needed to drive these models to make predictions for the future has meant that they are often run using national or regional climate projections. At finer spatial scales, variation in climate conditions can have a substantial influence on yield and so the continued use of coarse resolution climate data risks maladaptive agricultural decisions. Opportunities to grow novel crops, for which knowledge of local variation in microclimate may be critical, may be missed. We demonstrate how microclimate information can be acquired for a region and used to run a mechanistic crop suitability model under present day and possible future climate scenarios. We use microclimate modelling techniques to generate 100 m spatial resolution climate datasets for the south-west of the UK for present day (2012–2017) and predicted future (2042–2047) time periods. We use these data to run the mechanistic crop model WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) for 56 crop varieties, which returns information on maximum crop yields for each planting month. Over short distances, we find that the highest attainable yields vary substantially and discuss how these differences mean that field-level assessments of climate suitability could support land-use decisions, enabling food production whilst protecting biodiversity. We provide code for running WOFOST in the WofostR R package, thus enabling integration with microclimate models and meaning that our methodology could be applied anywhere in the world. As such, we make available to anyone the tools to predict climate suitability for crops at high spatial resolution for both present day and possible future climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable intensification (SI) is envisioned as an effective strategy for developing countries to increase farm productivity while reducing negative environmental and social externalities. The development of regionally appropriate SI options however requires accounting for the knowledge and preferences of key stakeholders. In Bangladesh, the Government has requested international donors to support the development of dry season rice expansion in the coastal region. Policies however tend to be made without adequate study of farmers' preferences and ambitions; this can render crop intensification efforts ineffective. Understanding farmers' preferences for alternative crops and crop management practices are therefore crucial for success where agricultural development investments aim at incorporating the principles of SI. Using coastal Bangladesh as a case study– we aim to (1) quantify farmers' preferences for alternative irrigated crop and crop management options in comparison to the status quo (land fallowing), (2) analyze whether farmers' preferences are conditioned by concerns regarding the cost and availability of irrigation and fertilizer inputs in comparison to expected net revenues, (3) understand how the heterogeneity in preferences can be attributed to farmer and/or farm characteristics, institutional, and biophysical factors, (4) determine how much farmers' are willing to invest in different crops and crop management options – including those reliant and not reliant on irrigation. Taking 300 farmers in two diverse coastal environments, a choice experiment (CE) was employed to explore the heterogeneity in farmers' preferences for different dry \"rabi\" season intensification options ('boro' rice, maize, wheat and mungbean) against the status quo (dry season land fallowing after harvest of the monsoon season rice crop). Analyses included random parameter logit modeling followed by willingness-to-invest and profit simulations. Analyses revealed strong farmer preferences against rice and in favor of irrigated maize, and also in favor of rainfed or partially irrigated mungbean as an alternative to land fallowing. Irrespective of their location and environmental conditions, respondents had largely a negative preference for irrigation and fertilizer use due to high investment costs and associated production risks in the dry season. Nonetheless, a significant positive effect on their willingness-to-intensify cropping was observed where farmers felt it feasible to provide in-field drainage to limit waterlogging risks. The study signifies the importance of accounting for farmers' preferences while developing context-specific SI policies. Improving agronomic investments, tenure security, market, credit and extension support are likely prerequisites, alongside targeted diffusion of stress-tolerant mungbean and maize varieties for SI in coastal Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "Family-run cow-calf farms based on native grasslands exhibit low economic and social sustainability, as reflected in low family incomes and high workloads. Experimental results have shown that pasture–herd interaction management could improve native grasslands and animal productivity. This paper analyzes the extent to which the sustainability of family-run livestock farms based on native grasslands could be enhanced by a systemic redesign informed by ecological intensification practices. The research questions address the initial state of farm sustainability, key bottlenecks to improving farm sustainability, and changes in sustainability criteria achieved over three years of farm redesign. The study was executed as part of a multi-level co-innovation project in Uruguay in which a team of scientist-practitioners and seven farm families participated in farm characterization, diagnosis, and redesign. The farm characterization took the form of indicators to describe the farms' management and bio-physical subsystems. Redesign plans were negotiated between the research team and the farmers. Frequent monitoring and evaluation cycles enabled finetuning across the years of implementation. Improvements were observed in the economic indicators gross margin (+55%), return to labor (+71%), and family income (+53%) and in the social indicator workload (−22%), and the environmental indicators bird diversity and ecosystem integrity index were maintained or increased slightly. These changes were explained by the uptake of coherent sets of ecological intensification practices causing changes in forage height (+30%), forage allowance (+69%), pregnancy (+22), weight of weaning calf per mating cow (+32%), and presence of tussocks (+65%). Ecological intensification principles resulted in synergistic positive effects between productivity–biodiversity tradeoffs and the scope for enhanced farm resilience and stability. Cow-calf family-run farms can be transformed to produce positive environmental and social effects and viable economic results. The implementation of projects in a co-innovation context may be taken as a guide to scaling up and scaling out the ecological intensification of livestock production on native grasslands, contributing to an extension system at the national level with the aim of improving cow-calf systems sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Objective of this study was to define current typical Finnish beef production systems and to estimate the environmental impacts of Finnish beef. Environmental impacts were estimated using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach with key impact categories; global warming (GWP), eutrophication and acidification potential. Both beef and dairy breed -based systems were investigated separately and, in more detail, separately for heifers, bulls and cows. In addition, regarding GWP, assessment with more specified greenhouse gas emission models were compared to assessment with models used in Finnish National Inventory Report (NIR).To gain detailed knowledge of the environmental impacts and mitigation potential in Finnish beef production system, environmental LCA model was integrated to biological plant and animal production models. Dynamic assessment model was constructed to provide a direct presentation of the effects of shifting diet, slaughter age or weight to GWP, eutrophication, acidification from all sources simultaneously. The GWP of Finnish beef fattening phase varied from 16.2 to 20.0 kgCO2-eq./kg carcass weight (CW) with specified methods and from 16.8 to 19.2 kgCO2-eq./kgCW with NIR methods. The average dairy breed beef GWP resulted 24.9 kgCO2-eq./kgCW, while the beef breed beef GWP was 32.1 kgCO2-eq./kgCW with specified emission models. With IDF allocation and NIR methods, GWP of average dairy breed beef was 19.5 kgCO2-eq./kgCW and for average beef breed beef it was 33.6 kgCO2-eq./kgCW. The aquatic eutrophication the average dairy breed beef resulted 21.7 gPO4-eq./kg CW, while for the average beef breed beef it was 33.1 gPO4-eq./kgCW. Acidification potential of average dairy beef was 58.3 gAE-eq/kgCW and of average beef breed beef was 64.3 gAE-eq./kg CW. When the IDF allocation was used with specified assessment methods, the GWP of beef from dairy breed cattle was estimated nearly 20% lower compared to allocation based on Finnish feeding requirements. Present study showed that in the current Finnish beef production the dairy breed beef had significantly lower environmental load in all three impact categories. It was observed that the specified methods, which were able to distinguish differences between annual and perennial crops and take the feed quality better into account, gave significantly different results when compared to NIR methods. As the LCA model was constructed to provide assessment tool for further scenario comparisons, the specified methods were considered to give better resolution for these assessments.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is projected to negatively impact food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. The magnitude of these impacts is expected to be amplified by the extensive reliance on rainfed agriculture and the prevalence of subsistence farming. In the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa, smallholder farming households are largely dependent on root, tuber and banana crops. However, the potential impacts of various climate change scenarios on these crops are not well reported. Yet, data-rich insights about the future impacts of climate change on these crops and the adaptive capacity of food systems in the Great Lakes Region is critical to inform research and development investments towards regional climate change adaptation. We aimed to gain insights of potential impacts of climate change on root, tuber, and banana crops in the Great Lakes Region, specifically investigating changes to localised crop suitability, planting dates, and identifying potential 'climate-proof' variety types of each crop for specific geographies. We developed a modified version of the EcoCrop model to analyse the suitability of future climates for four key root, tuber, and banana crops (banana, cassava, potato, and sweetpotato) and a suite of varieties for each (typical, heat-tolerant, drought-tolerant, and early maturing). The model considers only the direct impacts of climate change on crop suitability. It does not consider how climate change impacts crop suitability by affecting the occurrence of extreme weather events or indirect effects on incidence and severity of pest and disease outbreaks. Our results demonstrate that climate change will be somewhat favourable to root, tuber, and banana-based systems, with only widespread negative impacts seen for potato. These changes should be qualified by the observation that in most cases the environmental suitability for banana, cassava, and sweetpotato will remain constant or improve if farmers shift planting schedules. Location- and crop-dependent shifts to different variety types were found to be effective in improving suitability under future climates. Data driven insights generated from this work can be used as a first step in developing spatially explicit recommendations for both farmers and decision-makers on how to adapt to climate change and plan investment in the research needed to adapt root, tuber, and banana-based livelihoods and systems to those long-term changes.",

    "abstract": "Eco-efficiency offers a promising approach for the sustainable intensification of production systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is widely used for eco-efficiency analyses, is however sensitive to outliers and the analysis of the influence of external factors in the second stage requires the separability assumption to hold. Order-m estimators are proposed to overcome those disadvantages, but have been rarely applied in eco-efficiency analysis. This paper assesses the eco-efficiency of smallholder perennial cash crop production in Ghana and Kenya. It examines factors influencing eco-efficiency scores and in doing so, tests the application of order-m frontiers as a promising method for eco-efficiency analysis in the agricultural context. The analysis is performed for four selected perennial crop cases, namely cocoa, coffee, macadamia, and mango, applying DEA as well as the order-m approach to a comprehensive empirical dataset. Seven relevant environmental pressures as well as determining factors around capacity development, farm and farmer features, and crop production environment are considered. The distribution of eco-efficiency estimates among coffee farms showed the widest spread, which indicates the greatest potential to increase eco-efficiency. However, also the dispersion of scores within the other crop cases suggests room for improvements of eco-efficiency within the current production context. The subsequent analysis of determinants based on the order-m scores revealed that eco-efficiency scores were strongly influenced by variables, which measure capacity development, and resource endowments, such as labor and land, whereas the crop production environment had some influence, but results were unspecific. Generally, a positive effect is highly context-specific. The results underline the importance of designing effective training modalities and policies that allow knowledge to be put into practice, which involves the creation of marketing opportunities, the provision of targeted and regular advisory services, as well as region-wide measures to build and maintain soil fertility in a sustainable manner. To our knowledge, this study presents the first attempt to apply inputoriented order-m frontiers to assess eco-efficiency in the agricultural context, comparing its eco-efficiency rankings to those estimated with the widely applied DEA approach. This can inform the discussion on robust eco-efficiency assessments.",

    "abstract": "Crop phenology integrates information of how environmental drivers and management practices affect plant performance and crop yield. However, little is known about the impact of cropping systems (CS) on crop phenology and how this relates to differences in yield. We assessed the applicability of PhenoCams to track crop phenology, how four CS, i.e., organic vs. conventional farming with either intensive or conservation (no/reduced) tillage affect the phenology of a pea-barley mixture and winter wheat, how crop phenology is related to harvest characteristics, e.g., grain yield and total N uptake, and explains CS effects on these characteristics. We used time-lapse cameras (PhenoCams) to track vegetation changes in the two crops and extracted the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) to estimate different phenological metrics, i.e., dates with major changes in GCC (PhenoTimePoints), the duration between those (PhenoPhases), and the rate of increasing or decreasing GCC (PhenoSlopes). We assessed how phenological metrics were affected by different CS, and related phenological metrics to harvest characteristics. CS significantly affected phenological metrics of both crops, with less pronounced effects in the unfertilized pea-barley mixture compared to the fertilized winter wheat, and stronger effects for early-season than for late-season PhenoTimePoints. For winter wheat, organic compared to conventional farming caused an initial growth lag (up to 7 days) and a shorter duration (approximately 10 days) of the period of stable GCC. Winter wheat in reduced/no-tillage systems showed a tendency of delayed phenology (up to 5 days) compared to intensive tillage. While phenological metrics explained harvest characteristics of winter wheat well, they were almost unrelated to those of pea-barley, most likely because pea-barley yields were similar among CS. For winter wheat, effects of CS on harvest characteristics could be well explained by phenological metrics (max. R2 = 0.9). Thus, we demonstrated that delayed phenology acted as an important factor causing lower yield in organic compared to conventional farming. PhenoCams are valuable tool for high-resolution temporal monitoring of crop phenology. As different CS have been proposed as a tool for climate change adaptation, we suggest that the effects of CS on crop phenology need to be considered as they may impact yield via changes in crop phenology, particularly in organic agriculture.",

    "abstract": "The global demand for food is expected to continue increasing for decades, which may drive both agricultural expansion and intensification. The associated environmental impacts are potentially considerable but will depend on how the agricultural sector develops. Currently, there are contrasting regional developments in agriculture; expansion and/or intensification in some regions and abandonment in others, as well as changes in the type of farming. However, the environmental consequences of changes in farm type are not well understood. We have evaluated the impacts of farm type on food production and three key environmental variables—landscape openness, grassland biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—in three marginal agricultural regions in Sweden. We do this by first dividing the population of farms in each region into types, based on their land-use and livestock holdings using an innovative clustering method. Thereafter we analysed changes in production activities for farm types over time and evaluated the environmental and food-production impacts, where landscape openness is quantified using a novel indicator. Our results show that there is not one single farm type that would simultaneously maximize food production, grassland biodiversity, and landscape openness, whilst minimizing GHG emissions. However, there exists considerable potential to manage the trade-offs between food production and these environmental variables. For example, by reducing land use for dairying and instead increasing both cropping for food production and extensive livestock grazing to maintain landscape openness and biodiversity-rich semi-natural pastures, it would keep food production at similar levels. Our farm typology allows us to assess the multifunctionality of farming, by relating contrasting production activities to multiple ecosystem services, grassland biodiversity and GHG emissions for informing policy towards more sustainable agriculture. We have demonstrated this with examples under Swedish conditions, but it should to a large extent also be applicable for other countries.",

    "abstract": "Vegetable production is highly dependent on chemical fertilisers and pesticides, but the intensive use of these inputs negatively impacts the environment and human health. Ecological Intensification (EI) has the potential to counter the adverse effects of agricultural intensification and improve sustainability. Despite the potential benefits of EI for the environment, the adoption rate of EI in vegetable production is low. Moreover, most studies on EI adoption focus on implementing a single farming practice or a single production stage. This article aims to empirically analyse what factors influence the simultaneous adoption of various EI practices in different vegetable crop production stages by farmers in the context of an emerging economy such as Chile. Further, since the literature on EI practices adoption mainly analyses these factors as separate from each other, we aim to explore the interactions between factors and how these jointly impact the application of EI practices. We collected data via a survey to vegetable growers in the central zone in Chile. First, we measure EI practices adoption through a farm-level index that reflects the sustainability of farming practices in five production stages. Second, we identify which factors affect EI practices adoption through multiple linear regressions. Third, based on the results of the previous steps, we carried out a literature review to see how the factors predicting the adoption of EI could interact. This analysis was performed using structural equation modelling. Our results show that being a woman, receiving training on EI practices, and being pro-environment positively affect EI practices adoption. Contrarily, obstacles include the perception of risk and barriers, better access to credit and higher income from farm activities, all of which negatively affect EI practices adoption. With reference to the interaction amongst the factors, we found that economic resources, trust and training are the major factors affecting the perception of risk and barriers amongst Chilean farmers when it comes to adopting EI practices. Embracing a broad perspective, including different farming practices and production stages, allowed us to offer insights into the complex processes of adopting EI practices. Identifying which factors are important and how these factors interact with each other, contributes to the debate on whatpolicymakers and scholars need to focus in order to increase the use rate of EI practices.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable cropping systems need to balance productivity and profitability with resource and environmental conservation. Within a population of cropping system observations, there might be positive deviants that outperform others in terms of sustainability, which could serve as \"model systems\" for future development. Wheat-maize double cropping is the dominant system in the North China Plain, which is facing multiple economic, societal, and environmental sustainability challenges. Identifying exemplary positive deviants out of a multitude of wheat-maize observations might provide solutions to enhance overall sustainability. We aimed to 1) identify exemplary wheat-maize systems that reached optimal performance across seven sustainability indicators, 2) determine which factors regarding management practices and farming contexts resulted in the sustainability gaps between exemplary and other systems, and 3) propose a sustainable wheat-maize prototype. Based on a farmer survey dataset (n = 344), we developed a cropping system-level positive deviance approach, including multi-criteria assessment, positive deviant identification (Pareto ranking) and positive deviant clustering, to identify exemplary wheat-maize systems. We then compared exemplary and other systems to quantify the sustainability gaps and identify the key variables explaining sustainability gaps. Sixteen percent of wheat-maize cases were Pareto-optimal and were classified as positive deviants. These were sorted into seven clusters representing contrasting sustainability patterns. Among these clusters, one comprised exemplary systems due to the best compromise over the indicator set. Compared to remaining wheat-maize cases, exemplary systems, on average, resulted in 49% and 17% higher gross margin and dietary energy output, respectively, and 33–51% lower labor use, groundwater depletion, N loss, net greenhouse gas emission, and pesticide use. Key practices conferring exemplary system performance included higher maize seeding density, lower fertilizer N input in wheat, partial substitution of inorganic fertilizer with manure, a smaller number of irrigation events, and a lower frequency of pesticide and herbicide application. No significant difference in farming context was found between exemplary and other systems. Since the practices of exemplary systems were already locally adopted and proven, we expect that farmers in the region can increase the sustainability of their wheat-maize production by adjusting their management to resemble the exemplary systems. The positive deviance approach thus provides a pragmatic bottom-up approach to identify practices that can improve the sustainability of cropping systems, and can be used for other cropping systems elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean Basin has been identified as a climate change \"hotspot\", a region where increased warming and drying are expected to occur at rates faster than the global average. Increasing scientific attention has therefore been drawn to the repercussions of climate change for the Mediterranean's diverse and valued agricultural sector. The extent to which these repercussions vary throughout the region, owing both to a non-uniform distribution of climatic hazards and to uneven adaptive capacities of farmers, remains however unquantified. We hereby provide a comprehensive spatial assessment of the potential to implement different farm-based land and water management adaptations across the Mediterranean's croplands, and evaluate the extent to which different regions see a match or a mismatch between areas of adaptation need and areas of adaptation capacity. This approach made use of spatial multi-criteria analysis to evaluate the suitability of different farm adaptations, and relied on the Ecocrop climate suitability model and climate data on changing duration or frequency of extremes to identify areas of adaptation need under a high-end climate change scenario. The adaptations explored in this work span a range of sustainable approaches addressing different components of the farming system (soil-based, water-based, and crop-based adaptations). For each sub-system, we compared the potential to implement an adaptation representing an incremental change vs. one involving greater transformation. Results indicate a worsening of climatic conditions for all croplands in the region, and particularly within the Mediterranean extents of Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Spain, Morocco, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Israel. In more than half of these countries, >60% of highly affected Mediterranean areas, on average, see no tangible potential to implement adaptations. Importantly, potentials for adaptation, and particularly of transformational adaptations having the greatest hypothesized capacity to buffer against the effects of climate change, are found to be lower within areas where the most adverse climate change hazards are forecast to occur. For regions found to be approaching so-called limits to adaptation, this research contributes to growing calls for consideration of more transformational options, alongside the opportunities and sacrifices these options entail. For regions where considerable (yet unrealized) adaptation capacity is found to match areas of adaptation need, this paper instead presents a basis for further investigation on how to bridge adaptation capacity and preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide farmer managed irrigation systems have provided crops for food, feed and the market for centuries. From high mountain environments to river valleys and deltas, in all continents people have organized to construct, use, maintain, transform and sustain irrigated agro-ecosystems. In this context it is important to better understand how these systems are sustained. The objective of this contribution is to explore and theorize through which strategies and mechanisms irrigators are able to sustain these systems in a constantly changing socio-environmental context. The study is based on ethnographic qualitative research in four areas where farmer managed irrigation systems are sustained by irrigators (Valencia region, Spain; Ecuadorian highlands; Cambodian Mekong delta; and Tsangano district, Mozambique). Research consisted of interviews and observations in these areas and was supported by a literature review of what has been published about these systems. Results show that farmer managed irrigation systems are dynamic systems that constantly transform but that are sustained in these changes through what we term 'communality'. We introduce this term to point out three interrelated elements that stand at the basis of farmer managed irrigation systems sustenance, namely: commons, community and polity. Analysis of the four case studies points out that these three elements are mobilized differently by farmers depending on their socio-environmental context. We show that the mobilization of these different elements amidst internal and external challenges and conflicts, forms the basis for the longevity and sustainability of collectively managed irrigation systems. In the literature on farmer managed irrigation systems collective action has been portrayed as the main pillar that sustains these systems. This contribution challenges this notion by showing that irrigation systems are sustained by a combination of individual actions, collective practices, normative frameworks and organizational forms; a sense of community; and the development of political agency (polity). Recognizing that these elements come together as site specific hybrids opens new avenues of inquiry to better understand the sustainability of farmer managed irrigation systems.",

The cropping systems tested included a sole maize system rotated with a legume-legume intercrop (Doubled-up legume), an innovation involving two maize rows intercropped with two legume species (Mbili-Mbili), maize-legume intercrop both with and without de-topping, maize-legume intercrop (2 maize plants at 50 cm intra-space, de-topped), maize-legume system (maize with vertical leaf architecture) and a farmer practice. The Mbili-Mbili technology adaptation assessment was conducted on 225 farmers during the 2021 cropping season. Overall, maize grain yields increased by up to 56% in improved compared to farmer intercropping practices (P ≤ 0.05). There were no significant differences in maize grain yield among the improved practices. Significantly higher pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) yields of between 71% and 113% in 2020 and between 65% and 140% in 2021 were observed under Doubled-up legume and between 63% and 124% under local farmer practices in 2020 than in the improved cereal-legume practices. Across the study period, net revenues of sole maize and Doubled-up legume rotations were both the highest and lowest relative to other intercropping options, depending on the starting phase (US$ 653 sole maize and US$ 326 legume phase starting). These were also associated with the highest variances indicating instability. Mbili-Mbili intercropping system had not only high net revenue i.e., a mean of US$623 per hectare, but also more stable. Farmers perceived that Mbili-Mbili increased food security and 96% were willing to implement the system without project support. Mbili-Mbili is recommended for adoption by farmers because of its potential economic benefits, food security and resilience in the current unpredictable weather and climate patterns.",

    "abstract": "Well-managed agricultural land can provide ecosystem services and contribute positively to the environment. Many of these services are mediated through the soil and are referred to as soil functions. Regenerative agriculture is a mode of agriculture that uses soil conservation as the entry point to regenerate and contribute to these ecosystem services, with the aspiration that this will enhance not only environmental, but also social and economic dimensions of food production. The main objective of this paper is to create a modelling framework which allows the ex-ante redesign of diverse farming systems and assessment of ecosystem services associated with regenerative agriculture in diverse pedo-climatic conditions. Within this modelling framework we combined two models (Soil Navigator (SN) and FarmDESIGN (FD)) to consider soil attributes at the field-scale and environmental and socio-economic outcomes at farm-scale. We used a Dutch dairy-farm as case-study to demonstrate how this framework can be used to assess associated ecosystem services and explore alternative farm configurations. Combining SN with FD indicated what ecosystem services could be improved in a local context. Together these models help to evaluate the impact of soil management practices as the basis for exploring the overall socio-economic and environmental sustainability of our dairy case-study farm. For our dairy case-study farm, we found a set of management practices that delivered four out of the five functions at a high capacity, at the expense of primary productivity (from high to medium) and farm profitability (from 55,620 to 40,720 € yr−1). The decline in primary productivity, however, causes an improvement in other ecosystem services such as, climate regulation (increased from medium to high) and the soil organic matter surplus (increased with 7%). While this study successfully demonstrated an initial combination of SN and FD models for the ex-ante redesign and assessment of farming systems towards regenerative agriculture, further model development is essential to widen the applicability of this study to include emerging farming practices and new indicators of sustainability that are measured over a longer period. For regenerative agriculture to be meaningful for diverse farming systems, we need methods that give insight into the efficacy of regenerative management to meet multiple ecosystem services within local contexts. As such, our modelling framework can be used by researchers as a tool to help various stakeholders to assess and redesign farms based on the objectives of regenerative agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Agroecosystems' social-ecological resilience largely depends on the crop diversity generated and maintained by farmers, which provides insurance against changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. In turn, crop diversity generation, maintenance, and distribution is influenced by seed circulation networks. Thus, patterns of seed circulation can support or constrain households' access to crop diversity, affecting on-farm crop diversity. We aimed at understanding the mechanisms shaping seed circulation and farmers' access to crop diversity by: Assessing how crop biocultural traits influence patterns of seed circulation; Exploring the connections between household position in the seed circulation network and on-farm crop diversity for different crops. We conducted research in south-eastern Senegal applying crop diversity inventories and a survey to document seed acquisitions for the six local staple crops, which differ in biocultural traits. Household's varietal diversity and household- and community-level network measures calculated for each crop were used to compare seed circulation patterns among crops. Then, we analyzed the association between households' position in the seed circulation networks and households' on-farm crop diversity using generalized linear models. Our research advances two main findings about the importance of seed circulation networks for farmers' access to crop diversity. First, several seed circulation networks operate in the same community and at the same time. Each species circulated differently, which can be explained by crop's biocultural traits. Socio-cultural traits, like the cultural relevance of a crop, and biological traits, like crop's functional group (e.g., legumes, cereals), affect the patterns of seed circulation. Seed circulation networks that involved external actors, like agricultural extension projects or NGOs, were more centralized than seed circulation networks in which these actors were absent. Second, household's centrality in the network of seed circulation (indegree and betweenness) was generally associated with higher on-farm varietal diversity. However, the factors that determined household's access to seeds differed among crops and variety types. Farmer-to-farmer seed circulation networks are instrumental for the maintenance and distribution of agrobiodiversity and catalyze the introduction of new diversity in the agricultural system. However, tensions exist between traditional and new (e.g., interventions) mechanisms of seed sharing, resulting in centralized and unidirectional seed distribution, which might affect the social-ecological resilience of the system.",

    "abstract": "Information on how crop yields are affected by weather variations and extreme weather is needed to develop climate adaptation measures for arable cropping systems. Here, we analysed the effects of weather anomalies and soil texture on crop yield anomalies across Sweden from 1965 to 2020. The aims of this study were to (i) assess the effects of temperature and precipitation anomalies and extreme weather on crop yield anomalies for major field crops across Sweden, (ii) quantify how crop responses to weather anomalies vary along the north-south climate gradient across Sweden, and (iii) elucidate the impacts of soil texture on yield responses to weather anomalies. We used daily mean air temperature, daily total precipitation, soil texture and crop yield data from public databases covering all 21 counties in Sweden. Yield data was detrended to account for the effects of agricultural intensification on crop productivity. To assess seasonal weather influences on crop yields, temporal trends of daily average temperature and daily total precipitation were detrended for each season containing a three-month period. We also used a water balance index and a heat wave index to evaluate the impact of extreme weather. Our analyses showed that years with extreme weather during summer (i.e. heat waves, drought or water excess) resulted in the largest negative yield anomalies. Spring-sown crops were more negatively affected by extreme weather compared to autumn-sown crops, which we associate with differences in the lengths of the growth period for autumn- and spring-sown crops. Effects of soil texture on yield anomalies were found for spring-sown cereals, where negative effects of drought were exacerbated with increasing sand content. Moreover, we showed that the effects of weather conditions on crop yield anomalies differed between different regions within the country. In northern Sweden, crop yields were more sensitive to excess water, while drought effects were more pronounced in southern Sweden. Similarly, increased summer temperatures favoured crop yields in northern Sweden but had a negative impact on crop yields in the southern part of the country. Our study demonstrates that weather impacts on yields vary between crops and locations, and that adaptation to future climate will require crop- and site-specific strategies.",

    "abstract": "Indonesia is the most important oil palm producing country. Nearly 40% of planted area is managed by smallholders, with yields well below the potential. Efforts to increase productivity have focused on the source of planting material, with little attention paid to plant nutrition. To assess the degree to which current productivity in smallholder oil palm fields is limited by nutrients in scenarios with distinct sources of planting material. We collected detailed data on leaf nutrient concentration from 30 fields to derive minimum sampling size needed to diagnose nutrient status. Subsequently, we collected data on yield and palm type from 973 smallholder fields to assess the importance of nutrient status and planting material in the determination of yield. Potassium (K) deficiency was widespread (88% of fields) and often severe. Nearly two thirds of fields were also deficient for nitrogen (N) and boron (B), half were phosphorous (P) deficient, and one third were magnesium (Mg) deficient. Nutrient imbalances, especially between K and N, were also common. Fields with sufficient N, P, and K levels yielded 47% more (equivalent to 1.2 t oil ha−1) than deficient fields across the entire range of planting materials. We conclude that improved plant nutrition increases fresh fruit yields in smallholder fields irrespective of the source of planting material. The advantage of certified planting material is reflected in the higher oil extraction rates. Increased smallholder oil palm yields on existing plantations through improved plant nutrition offers the opportunity to improve smallholder profits and livelihoods, whilst at the same time increasing total oil production without bringing new areas into cultivation.",

    "abstract": "The livestock sector in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is under increasing pressure to define its role in jointly addressing food security and climate change. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has been widely leveraged as an approach to achieving both food security and climate change outcomes through suites of interventions that maximize synergies and reduce tradeoffs among three pillars: productivity, climate change resilience, and climate change mitigation. However, operationalization of the CSA approach in the livestock sector is hindered by a lack of clarity around what the pillars mean for livestock systems, given their fundamental attributes compared to crops and the spatial and temporal dimensions of these attributes. A conceptual framework is also lacking for assessing and comparing the potential CSA synergies and tradeoffs that different livestock systems and interventions may generate. In this paper we aim to offer guidance on the operationalization of the CSA approach in the livestock sector. We draw on a literature review to explore the essential attributes of livestock systems in SSA as they relate to CSA objectives over different temporal and spatial scales. Based on this review, we propose a practical and flexible framework for assessing and comparing the synergies and tradeoffs that different livestock systems may generate among food security and climate change objectives over different spatial and temporal scales. The framework consists of four elements: CSA pillars, spatial-temporal scales, CSA objectives mapped to each spatial-temporal scale, and indicator guidance. Using farm survey data and national statistics, an illustrative application of the framework to two dairy farms in Rwanda is presented and discussed. The illustrative application demonstrates how the framework can be used to identify important, spatial-temporal CSA synergies and tradeoffs that otherwise may go unrecognized. Additional applications are needed to assess the utility, practicality, and potential of the framework to guide CSA operationalization in the livestock sector in SSA. Maximizing synergies and reducing tradeoffs among food security and climate change outcomes in the livestock sector is critical for a sustainable food future. With an emphasis on flexibility for tailoring to specific development contexts and compatibility with varying levels of data availability and methodological complexity, the framework is intended to support diverse stakeholders involved in policy and development seeking to identify those livestock systems that contribute most to food security and climate change objectives over time and space.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Climate change increasingly threatens food security, particularly through prolonged phases of drought. It is therefore important to evaluate and develop arable cropping systems with an enhanced capability to withstand severe drought events to ensure food production. However, it is still poorly understood whether specific management strategies, in particular organic farming and conservation tillage that are thought to be more resilient to drought, can enhance the ability of agroecosystem to withstand drought. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was, therefore, to test the ability of organic farming and conservation tillage practices to withstand drought within expected boundaries of climate scenarios for the end of the century. METHODS: This study summarizes the effects of drought (both natural and experimental) on the productivity of three arable crops (maize, pea-barley mixture and winter wheat) assessed in three consecutive years in a long-term cropping system field experiment. We tested whether four relevant cropping systems (i.e., conventional and organic with and without soil conservation tillage) differ in their ability to reduce the impact of drought on plant yield and crop performance. We studied conditions of moderate natural drought (summer 2018) and severe experimental droughts using rainout shelters (3 years) after 8 years of contrasting field management. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found pronounced and consistent yield reductions due to experimental drought events for all cropping systems (34% for maize, 23% for pea-barley, and 17% for winter wheat). Drought induced yield reductions were largely similar across the four cropping systems, suggesting very limited capacity of any cropping system to buffer severe drought. Yet, there was an obvious but insignificant trend in maize in 2018 where under moderate and experimental drought conservation tillage resulted in a higher on-average yield compared to the plowed systems. Furthermore, drought resulted in lower nitrogen (N) uptake by the crops and a positive N budget, which could result in higher N losses after a drought period. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that drought has consistent and adverse effects on crop productivity under conventional, organic and soil conservation arable cropping. It further demonstrates that it is difficult to find effective adaptation strategies for arable systems under realistic future scenarios and underlines the need to combine all available practices, from soil management to crop and cultivar choice, to mitigate drought impacts on crop productivity.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural food production is both affected by and contributing to climate change. At the global scale, agri-food systems are responsible for one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions. With progressing climate change, the risks of crop failure increase. Thus, an urgent need is to reduce emissions from food systems while increasing their resilience to climate change. Enormous untapped potentials to achieve these dual goals lie in transforming agri-food systems towards more diverse, plant-based, and regional food production systems. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for identifying climate-adapted alternative food crops that could (1) help to diversify existing cropping systems and thus increase their climate resilience and can be (2) nutritious elements of plant-based regional diets with reduced emissions. The approach builds on the model ecocrop to select food crops that could benefit from regionally projected changes in climate. The model-based analysis is complemented with a literature review to examine the ecocrop results for their plausibility and provide a broader assessment of potentials for cultivation, utilization, and nutritional values of model-selected crops. The approach is applied to Switzerland, where we identify eight alternative crops with the potential to increase climate resilience while contributing to healthy human diets of regional consumers with benefits for climate mitigation (almond, pecan, sesame, durum wheat, quinoa, lentil, lupine, and borage). The literature review indicated that the increasing demand for many of these crops suggests great potential for regional marketing of crop products. The results produced in this study provide an initial guide for researchers and innovative farmers interested in experimenting with alternative crops in Switzerland, thus promoting climate-smart food system transformation from the production side. Using our unbiased bottom-up screening approach, we identified climate-adapted alternative crops that can provide essential nutrients, cover nutritional gaps in Switzerland, diversify existing production systems, and improve sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Agroforestry, a sustainable land-use system that integrates trees with crops and/or livestock, is recognized as an effective strategy for synergizing climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in India. However, the prevalence of limited land under agroforestry indicates the presence of significant constraints hindering its widespread implementation. To address this challenge, the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) represents a potentially potent policy tool for driving the expansion of agroforestry at the sub-national level. The aim of this study was to examine (i) how the SAPCCs recognized and reported the benefits of agroforestry for climate change adaptation and mitigation, and (ii) what policy approaches are put forth to operationalize agroforestry in India. For this study, the information on agroforestry was coded using a hybrid approach (a combination of deductive and inductive coding) followed by thematic analysis and peer debriefing (for validation of the generated codes and themes). Many of the mitigation and adaptation benefits of agroforestry are reflected in the SAPCCs. However, the predominant focus of these SAPCCs has been on tree-based agroforestry, with insufficient attention given to the crop-tree-livestock nexus, which could offer greater scope for reducing agricultural emissions. Furthermore, existing constraints to the expansion of agroforestry have not been adequately addressed, and the strategies proposed lack the necessary precision to enable effective implementation on the ground. These shortcomings are further compounded by the absence of accurate budgetary estimates, thereby hindering the ability to execute meaningful actions at the grassroots level. The results of this study could offer valuable perspectives on how the potential benefits of agroforestry may be harnessed more prudently to realize mitigation and adaptation outcomes in India while aligning with the country's Nationally Determined Contributions and building sustainable livelihood.",

However, the benefits of organic agriculture are still controversial and need to be tested across wide environmental gradients. Here, we carried out an observational study to test how agronomic practices, pest management, environmental impact and yield of conventional and organic vineyards changed along wide climatic and landscape gradients across Italy. We used a block design with 38 pairs of conventional and organic vineyards across Italy. Most agronomic practices did not differ between conventional and organic vineyards. By contrast, landscape composition and climate were strong predictors of management in both systems. First, increasing semi-natural areas around the vineyards reduced pesticide pressure and related environmental impacts, but was also associated with lower yield. Second, irrespective of the farming system, a warm and dry climate was associated with reduced fungicide pressure. Conventional farming had a yield gain of 40% in cold and wet climate compared to organic but the yield gap disappeared in the warmest regions. In both farming systems, we observed a large variability in management practices that was mainly explained by climate and landscape composition. This large variability should be considered when evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of different farming systems under contrasting environmental contexts.",

    "abstract": "In Africa, farmer-herder conflicts can be partially attributed to linguistic differences that impede communication and conflict resolution. This tension can be further amplified by climatic shocks that increase incentives to fight for resources. Yet existing innovations and interventions in the agro-pastoralism system that aim to de-escalate farmer-herder conflicts often do not account for the interactive effect of linguistic diversity and climate shocks in affecting farmer-herder conflicts. Our objective is to assess the interactive effect of climate shocks and linguistic diversity on intensifying farmer-herder conflicts in multiple African countries. We also examine the implications on enabling linguistically inclusive innovations for agro-pastoralism system transformation in the face of climate shocks. We employ a Spatial Difference-in-Discontinuities design to causally assess the impact of linguistic diversity and its interaction with climate extremes in affecting farmer-herder conflict. We use month-district panel data between 2010 and 2023 for six African countries. The conflict data is obtained from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. Climatic shocks are calculated from the Standardized Precipitation Index. Estimation results are then combined with drought projections to examine the spatially heterogeneous evolution of climate-related farmer-herder conflicts in the future. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Farmer-herder conflicts are systematically more fatal in mixed-language districts compared to single-language districts. The fatality rate increases significantly when drought occurs in mixed-language districts. The differential starting value of conflict fatalities and the future drought may result in strikingly different trends in conflict fatality across districts in the future. Our findings suggest that building linguistically inclusive innovations in agro-pastoralism systems may contribute to de-escalating climate-related farmer-herder conflicts and mitigate the repercussions on rural livelihoods. Linguistic diversity ought to be assessed and used by donors and practitioners, to develop innovative solutions that foster communication and conflict resolution.",

    "abstract": "Publications in agroecology have been growing rapidly in recent decades. With roots in the biophysical sciences, social sciences, and peasant movements, agroecology is a transdisciplinary field bringing together different ways of knowing. Agroecological research has two main foci: a biophysical focus which operationalizes agroecology as the ecological study of agricultural production systems, and a socio-ecological focus that emphasizes agriculture as a coupled socio-ecological system, the importance of food systems and food security at the household and community level, and a normative dimension, focusing on social (in)justice and power inequalities. We examine the relationship between agroecology and the social sciences, asking specifically: 1) How are the engagements between agroecology and the social sciences changing over time, and how does this relationship compare to publishing trends in the biophysical and social sciences generally? 2) What is the engagement of agroecology over time with specific social science disciplines and fields — anthropology, economics, education, feminist studies, geography, political ecology/economy, sociology — and the recent social science topics of food justice and food sovereignty? 3) How do the topics and geographical focus of agroecology engaged with social science (AESS) differ from those of agroecology not engaged with social science (ANESS)? And, 4) in which journals are AESS and ANESS published? We quantitatively examine 7399 unique publications — gathered from five publication databases into our Agroecology Discipline Corpus 1960–2019 — to answer these questions. Our analyses show 1) the proportion of AESS is increasing over time, and that agroecology publications are growing at about double the rate of scientific literature overall; 2) increased engagement between agroecology and almost all social science disciplines and fields examined; 3) substantial topical differences between ANESS and AESS exist, reflecting ontological foci, as well as strong geographical differences in the proportion of AESS and ANESS; and 4) publication venues are not widely shared between AESS and ANESS, and a wide array of additional journals have become important venues for agroecological research from 2007 to 2019. We conclude by posing further questions about agroecology and the social sciences to be asked of the corpus we have assembled and classified. This review shows that agroecology's engagement with the social sciences has expanded greatly in recent decades, suggesting its further development as a transdisciplinary science and signaling its increasing relevance for large-scale agrifood systems change.",

    "abstract": "Approaches to scaling are persistently linear and focus on a single innovation, an innovator to control the scaling process, and a purpose driven by donor accountability. Alternative approaches that better reflect the complexity involved in sustainable development draw on systems thinking theory, but are hardly used. The Scaling Scan tool facilitates the integration of a systems approach to scaling to a broad public. This study draws from almost six years of experience using and adapting the Scaling Scan tool to deepen the theoretical and empirical understanding of what a systems approach to scaling is and what challenges project teams and organizations face to embrace this. This study uses data retrieved between 2017 and 2023 from 54 workshops where the Scaling Scan was used to scale innovations for sustainable development. Data were complemented with a literature study and SWOT analysis to understand the use, users, and user adaptations of the Scaling Scan tool. The Scaling Scans' focus on context, unintended consequences and the facilitation of collective understanding and collective action are important components of a systems approach to scaling. Multiple adaptations to the tools have been made by users to facilitate even more collective understanding. However, the early focus on \"the\" innovation to scale and the intrinsic assumption that this innovation addresses a key root cause or leverage point in the system risks to perpetuate a linear approach to scaling. The scoring of the scaling ingredients show a tendency to focus on familiar disciplines (mostly technical), limiting progression beyond a \"bigger pilot\" and engage with what or who is required for innovations to contribute to large scale change, such as market and public support. Transitioning from a linear to a systems approach to scaling is challenging because business models of research organizations depend on high adoption of \"their\" innovations. We find that, there are far-reaching implications of embracing a systems approach to scaling which not everyone may want or can accept. We can no longer assume that complex systemic problems such as hunger and poverty will be solved by having more of an innovation. Yet this is still the dominant approach for research for development organizations to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. The experience with the Scaling Scan contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of tools to facilitate the integration of systems thinking in innovation and scaling initiatives aimed at sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Agri-food systems in rural areas are increasingly dependent on collective and participatory actions to preserve traditional production and local agro-ecosystems. The deployment of digital technologies is expected to play a role in this context, provided that an integrated use of these tools is pursued. The paper analyses the characteristics of an integrated strategy of digitalisation led by a collective organisation, integrating the perspective of the Socio-Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) in the agri-food system. The aim is to reveal how the digitalisation process shapes and impacts on the governance of collective actions in a scenario of ecological transition. This case study examines the production system and Consortium for the protection of PDO Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, using the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. Evidence from official documents, direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and focus group are used to identify action situations and their connections. The paper allows us to identify a network of applications of digital tools, adopted in different business areas of a complex organisation such as the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium and its production system. This network of integrated business functions can be seen as the hallmark of the digitalisation strategy elaborated by this Consortium at the intersection with the surrounding social and physical domains, strengthening the embeddedness in the PR production system. However, some obstacles and drawbacks of this strategy also emerged, such as a marginal integration with the ecological transition. This research makes a valuable contribution to the process of identifying the fundamental elements of the digital network that represents the digitalisation strategy of the Parmigiano Reggiano production system. It is important to address any existing limitations and emerging conflicts in order to guarantee effective quality monitoring and traceability of the cheese without any prejudice for the natural resources of the PR production area. This must be done in a way that does not compromise the distinctive production processes that are deeply rooted in local traditions and require specialised, labour-intensive techniques.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing appreciation of the role of aquaculture in improving food and nutrition security in Timor-Leste. The Timor-Leste government's National Aquaculture Development Strategy (NADS; 2012–30) envisions to increase domestic aquaculture production to 12,000 tons to achieve per capita fish consumption of 15 kg annually by 2030. However, aquaculture development is constrained by limited access to quality seed, feed, and improved technologies. WorldFish has been collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries since 2015 to help realise the target. The objective was to present step-wise interventions – Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) hatcheries establishment and monosex seed production and distribution; conduct of on-farm grow-out trials; training and capacity building; and extension, communication and marketing services - carried out, and demonstrate how availability, accessibility and consumption of fish could be increased sustainably in the subsistence farming systems of Timor-Leste. Farmers' participatory grow-out trials following better management practices (BMPs) were conducted in two phases from 2015 to 2023 across ten farmers clusters in four municipalities in inlands. The trials in Phase 1 tested GIFT stocked at 3 fingerlings/m2 using green water in ponds and fed with locally made plant-based feed. In Phase 2, trials tested GIFT stocked at 5 fingerings/m2 with high quality imported pelleted feed supplemented with local feed and green water. To facilitate scaling, local service providers, feed importers and fish market operators were trained to facilitate input supply and output marketing. In Phase-1, one existing public hatchery was upgraded for producing and supplying quality GIFT broodstock to private hatcheries and one private hatchery was established with public-private partnership (PPP) model. On-farm trials showed that farmers following BMPs and feeding with farm made feed achieved fish yield averaging 4.3 ± 1.5 t/ha/11 months production cycle. In Phase-2, PPP model hatcheries were established; nursery operators connected to each hatchery started nursing fry to fingerlings to local farmers. On-farm trials results managed by 169 farmers in 417 ponds during 2020–2022 showed fish yield of 12.4 ± 0.1 t/ha/ 6 month cycle with full BMPs, suggesting the viability of GIFT intensification across Timor-Leste. Continuous technical backstopping of public and private sectors, however, is crucial for scaling and sustainable intensification of aquaculture. GIFT aquaculture development model of Timor-Leste has potential for scaling across the country for reducing peoples' malnutrition and poverty. The model can also potentially be replicated to other small island nations of the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Climate services are integral to climate change adaptation in agriculture. Inclusive innovation prioritises inclusion of marginalised actors, grassroots knowledge and accessibility of use. Yet many innovation processes are multi-stakeholder, complex and may not prioritise inclusion from the outset. In these circumstances, researchers and designers may seek to influence existing projects towards greater inclusivity. This paper explores efforts to increase the inclusivity of existing innovation processes, focusing on the design of My Climate View, an online Australian climate services platform for agriculture. Findings relate to contemporary issues in inclusive innovation literature, including: (1) Who should be included in innovation processes (within given resourcing)?; (2) How requirements for inclusion or exclusion can emerge through the design and use of a technology; and (3) The influence of program level structures upon inclusivity and design. Our approach is informed by Responsible Innovation and Inclusive Innovation theory and enacted through user-centred design. Findings are synthesised from analysis of 60 semi-structured interviews with farmers, advisors and extension officers. We additionally draw on observations as researchers in the multi-actor My Climate View development team, where extensive engagement separate to research activities has included agricultural and Indigenous stakeholders. Engaging with a broad sample of potential target users enabled diverse and sometimes unexpected use cases. Customisation of interface parameters allowed the incorporation of tacit knowledge and positively affected the inclusivity of My Climate View, extending the value of the platform to growers of niche commodities outside of the original scope. Inclusivity in innovation can be impacted by diverse factors, including design team decisions, structural factors, budget and external factors. Requirements for inclusion and exclusion can emerge and evolve throughout a design process, supporting Responsible Innovation's framing of inclusivity alongside principles of reflexivity and responsiveness. The findings enrich the evidence base for climate services and broader agricultural technology development processes by providing insights for those seeking greater impact by practicing inclusivity in innovation. We provide four implications for increasing inclusivity in the design of climate services: (1) Maximising customisation and avoiding prescriptive interpretation enables greater flexibility of use; (2) Sampling broadly within target users to uncover unanticipated values and opportunities for inclusion and exclusion; (3) It is important to embed efforts towards inclusion alongside processes of reflexivity; and (4) Responsible and inclusive approaches to climate services design are valuable even if brought in once development has commenced.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Over the last 26 years, researchers globally have successfully applied the soil nitrogen (N) model in the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate N cycling and its effects on crop production across a range of agricultural systems and environments. As the modelling community further expands its focus to include environmental impacts of farming, it needs the model to be fit for this broader purpose. OBJECTIVE: Accurately modelling N loss via different pathways demands more of the model and so, to inform and prioritise future development needs, we embarked on a detailed review of APSIM's soil N modelling capability. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of APSIM Soil N model verification studies and found 131 relevant publications across a wide range of systems, applications, and processes. We examined their approaches and findings, and distilled out the lessons learnt. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The model-data comparisons showed strong performance across all modelled processes, despite limited changes to the core of the soil N model since its inception. The model's relatively simple conceptual pool approach to modelling carbon (C) dynamics with N cycling linked via C:N ratios, has proven remarkably versatile. However, these conceptual pools have posed challenges relating to initialisation methods and the resulting sensitivity of predictions at different time scales, e.g. long-term C trajectories vs. short-term seasonal N dynamics. Correctly predicting timing of N loss on a daily timestep also proved challenging, but this level of resolution may not always be required. APSIM's adaptable code structure facilitated the creation of model prototypes (e.g., ammonia volatilisation and N in runoff) allowing testing of different conceptualisations ahead of formal release. SIGNIFICANCE: APSIM is one of the most widely used agricultural systems models. This review, which covers model documentation, model-data comparisons, various approaches to parameterisation, and prototypes for additional processes, consolidates decades of research into insights about the model and its functioning. The review highlights the importance of model evaluations across a wide range of applications to ensure model robustness, to identify issues that may be masked in single studies, and to allow the emergence of solutions with broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "In the UK, wheat is the most important cultivated cereal, grown extensively as a rainfed crop. Irrigation of wheat has previously been considered uneconomic, but increases in world wheat prices and recent droughts have led to some farmers revising their views. Widespread adoption of wheat irrigation would have major implications for wheat production, the irrigation industry and water resources in regions that are already water scarce. This study investigated the financial viability of irrigating winter wheat grown on a sandy loam soil in the East of England. Long-term climate data (1961–2011) for Silsoe (Bedfordshire) was used to drive a biophysical crop model to assess irrigation water requirements and yield response. Modelling assumed a typical irrigation schedule to maximise yield and quality, and average reported wheat prices for 2007 to 2012. Irrigation costs were calculated assuming an overhead mobile hosereel–raingun system applying river water, abstracted either in summer and used directly, or abstracted in winter and stored in an on-farm reservoir. The results suggest that the yield benefit would justify supplemental irrigation by farmers who have unused irrigation equipment and unused summer water, although irrigation of higher-value field vegetable crops later in the season would normally take precedence – the Added Value of Water (AVW) usefully applied to milling winter wheat under these conditions ranged between 0.24 and 0.32 £ m−3. Investment in new irrigation schemes could also be marginally viable if unused summer river water was available for direct abstraction (AVW = 0.08 £ m−3). Investments in new farm reservoirs for irrigating wheat are currently not profitable (AVW = –0.23 £ m−3). Sensitivity analysis suggests that in the longer term, the expected increase in world wheat prices and the impacts of climate change are likely to make the financial benefits stronger, particularly in the drier catchments further east and on low moisture retentive soils, but competing demands for water would still make extensive wheat irrigation unlikely.",

    "abstract": "This study used a meta-analytic approach to systematically examine changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensities (i.e., carbon footprints) between pulse-containing and pulse-free crop rotations in western Canada. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published literature relevant to the goal of the analysis and meta-analysis was conducted to determine statistically significant differences in GHG emissions between pulse-free and pulse-containing crop rotations. Four pulse-free reference rotations (cereal-cereal [CC]; oilseed-cereal [OC]; oilseed-oilseed [OO]; and cereal-oilseed [CO]) were compared to rotations where the first crop in each two-year sequence was replaced with either dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) or lentil (Lens culinaris M.). Two scenarios were considered. The first scenario investigated the effects of dry peas and lentils when synthetic nitrogen (N) applied to cereal and oilseed crops grown after pulses was not reduced (i.e., no change) (NN). The second scenario (NCR) investigated the effect of dry peas and lentils when synthetic N application rates were reduced to the maximum extent possible (i.e., credit) to maintain subsequent crop yields. Pooled analyses demonstrated that, in general, cereal and oilseed crops grown after a dry pea or lentil crop had similar or reduced GHG emissions compared to those grown after a cereal or oilseed. The GHG emissions from cereal and oilseed crops grown after dry peas and lentils were higher in NN (888–987 kg CO2e/ha; 286–598 kg CO2e/t) than in NCR (311–978 kg CO2e/ha; 116–598 kg CO2e/t), suggesting that emissions were reduced to a greater extent when pulse crops offset the N fertilizer requirements of a subsequent crop compared to when they were used to provide N to maximize crop yields. In two-year rotations, the inclusion of pulses reduced GHG emissions compared to all reference rotations in both NN (savings of 475–719 kg CO2e/ha over two years [area basis]; 164–496 kg CO2e/t over two years [yield basis]) and NCR (savings of 489–1185 kg CO2e/ha over two years [area basis]; 335–610 kg CO2e/t over two years [yield basis]), mostly as a result of reduced synthetic N requirements of the whole rotation. The results of the analysis are presented by crop for each pulse-free and pulse-containing cropping sequence for each scenario to allow for flexibility in comparing GHG emissions from various rotations.",

    "abstract": "In agricultural production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which would need to be paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO2e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production revenue foregone varies widely from 9.3 to 196.3 US$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions >5 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1 resulting in net emissions >8 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1 for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could play a major role in increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Cereal-based rotations dominate the prime production regions of Finland without any signs of noteworthy shifts towards more diverse systems. To estimate the potential for the future expansion of more diverse crop rotations we used multinomial logistic regression to model the probability that a field parcel would suit for crops other than cereals by acknowledging farmer's preferences in land allocation depending on field parcel characteristics (size, shape, slope, distance to farm center, proximity to waterway, soil type and ownership). This study covered ca. 700,000 field parcels in the prime production region and all the farm types. We identified parcels that were currently used for pure cereal rotations but were also suitable for the cultivation of more diverse crops, especially rapeseed and grain legumes as the most potential ones. There was substantial potential to shift from the current cereal rotations towards more diverse crop sequencing patterns in all farm types, but especially on pig, poultry and cereal farms, where some 18–20% of the cereal monoculture rotations could be shifted towards break crop rotations and 24–41% to diverse rotations. The diversification potential was dependent on the farm size and was higher on large farms with more suitable land for minor crops and with better logistic advantages. Hence, the ongoing increase in farm size and reduction in the number of farms could further support the transition towards more diverse crop sequencing. Diversity in both crop rotation and the agricultural landscape can be achieved simultaneously. Due to the characteristics of field parcels allocated to perennial grasslands and green-fallow rotations they were not suitable for diversifying arable crops.

    "abstract": "The next generation of gene-based crop models offers the potential of predicting crop vegetative and reproductive development based on genotype and weather data as inputs. Here, we illustrate an approach for developing a dynamic modular gene-based model to simulate changes in main stem node numbers, time to first anthesis, and final node number on the main stem of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). In the modules, these crop characteristics are functions of relevant genes (quantitative trait loci (QTL)), the environment (E), and QTL × E interactions. The model was based on data from 187 recombinant inbred (RI) genotypes and the two parents grown at five sites (Citra, FL; Palmira, Colombia; Popayan, Colombia; Isabela Puerto Rico; and Prosper, North Dakota). The model consists of three dynamic QTL effect models for node addition rate (NAR, No. d- 1), daily rate of progress from emergence toward flowering (RF), and daily maximum main stem node number (MSNODmax), that were integrated to simulate main stem node number vs. time, and date of first flower using daily time steps. Model evaluation with genotypes not used in model development showed reliable predictions across all sites for time to first anthesis (R2 = 0.75) and main stem node numbers during the linear phase of node addition (R2 = 0.93), while prediction of the final main stem node number was less reliable (R2 = 0.27). The use of mixed-effects models to analyze multi-environment data from a wide range of genotypes holds considerable promise for assisting development of dynamic QTL effect models capable of simulating vegetative and reproductive development.",

    "abstract": "To achieve a more sustainable food sector, a supply chain approach is needed. In this study, experts in different areas along supply chains co-operated in an interactive process to define future environmentally sustainable supply chains of milk and beef. The basis was to use existing techniques, to have production performance corresponding to the best quartile of today and to consider other sustainability aspects, such as economics. The work resulted in concrete descriptions of alternative product chains for delivered milk and beef. To also permit concrete descriptions of the latter part of the product chains, two consumer-packed end products were selected for monitoring, namely fresh milk and sirloin steak. The production systems investigated comprised cropping, livestock production, industrial processing and production, logistics, packaging and wastage and distribution, but not retailers or consumers. The study area was a Swedish county and the reference level was its production of milk and beef in 2012. The future product chains were assumed to deliver the same amounts of commodities as in 2012, but with reduced environmental impact. Primary production was required to be at least as profitable as today. Beside description of the current situation, three alternative scenarios were created, focusing on delivery of ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation and minimising climate impact, respectively. Life cycle assessments were performed for these four scenarios (reference plus three alternative scenarios) for single-product chains and county-wide. Furthermore, production costs in primary production were calculated for the four scenarios. The results revealed great potential to reduce the negative environmental impact of Swedish dairy and beef production at current volumes, irrespective of whether ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation or climate impact is in focus. The single most important factor for decreased environmental impact for livestock production was increased production efficiency. Measures in agriculture, especially concerning feeds, were critical, but actions in processing and distribution also contributed. All alternative scenarios resulted in lower production costs than at present. It was obvious that as dairy and beef systems are connected, the potential for their environmental improvement must be analysed together. In conclusion, increased efficiency can decrease the negative environmental impact of Swedish cattle production and also reduce costs to the farmer.",

    "abstract": "Commercial layer and indigenous chicken farming in Nairobi and associated activities in the egg value chains are a source of livelihood for urban families. A value chain mapping framework was used to describe types of inputs and outputs from chicken farms, challenges faced by producers and their disease control strategies. Commercial layer farms were defined as farms keeping exotic breeds of chicken, whereas indigenous chicken farms kept different cross breeds of indigenous chicken. Four focus group discussions were held with producers of these chickens in peri-urban area: Dagoretti, and one informal settlement: Kibera. Qualitative data were collected on interactions between farmers, sources of farm inputs and buyers of poultry products, simple ranking of production challenges, farmers' perception on diseases affecting chicken and strategies for management of sick chicken and waste products. Value chain profiles were drawn showing sources of inputs and channels for distribution of chicken products. Production challenges and chicken disease management strategies were presented as qualitative summaries. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti kept an average of 250 chickens (range 50-500); while flock sizes in Kibera were 12 chickens (range 5-20). Farms keeping indigenous chicken had an average of 23 chickens (range 8-40) in Dagoretti, and 10 chickens (range 5-16) in Kibera. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti obtained chicks from distributors of commercial hatcheries, but farms in Kibera obtained chicks from hawkers who in turn sourced them from distributors of commercial hatcheries. Indigenous chicken farms from Dagoretti relied on natural hatching of fertilised eggs, but indigenous chicken farms in Kibera obtained chicks from their social connection with communities living in rural areas. Outlets for eggs from commercial layer farms included local shops, brokers, restaurants and hawkers, while eggs from indigenous chicken farms were sold to neighbours and restaurants. Sieved chicken manure from Dagoretti area was fed to dairy cattle; whereas non-sieved manure was used as fertilizer on crops. Production challenges included poor feed quality, lack of space for expansion, insecurity, occurrence of diseases and lack of sources of information on chicken management. In Kibera, sick and dead chickens were slaughtered and consumed by households; this practice was not reported in Dagoretti. The chicken layer systems contribute to food security of urban households, yet they have vulnerabilities and deficiencies with regard to disease management and food safety that need to be addressed with support on research and extension.",

This study aimed to quantify and compare the impact of increased night temperature on potential yield and phenology of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crops modelled using APSIM with historical climate series (1961–2014) in sites representative of the Argentinean Pampas. For each site, the sowing date was adjusted to avoid frost and heat events at flowering, based on historical probability. The critical period was the more sensitive crop phase (shortened by 0.6 d decade−1) for the observed asymmetric warming; regional minimum temperature trend of ca. 0.14 and 0.16 °C decade−1 in wheat and barley, respectively. Wheat and barley yields declined across the region between ca. 2% and 9% per °C increase in the minimum temperature during the critical period, linked to lower cumulative radiation capture as a result of a shorter crop phase and lower incident radiation due to displacement towards winter. Regional variability in the simulated yield response to the observed night warming was mainly explained by differences the response of incident solar radiation during the critical period to the minimum temperature increase.",

    "abstract": "Organic farming has been proposed as a feasible way to reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture, provide better products to consumers, and improve farmers' income. How organic farmers are distributed worldwide, however, remains unknown. Using publicly accessible registries of organic crop farmers we mapped their distribution globally and related it to local socio-economic, climatic, and soil characteristics. We show that organic crop farmers are mostly present in areas with favorable socio-economic and climatic conditions, both globally but also within countries. Within developed countries, the locations of organic crop farmers often do not differ significantly from the locations of conventional crop farmers. In developing countries, there are, however, larger differences and organic crop farmers concentrate in the more accessible and developed regions. Our results suggest that crop farmers in poor areas may not have sufficient access to certification and markets. To promote the spread of organic farming, certification and other incentives could target farmers in areas with lower market access and higher levels of poverty which could improve value chains for organic products in these areas.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity and the weak position of smallholders in food value chains are key challenges in many low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to increase food security and make agricultural value chains more inclusive, donors, governments and researchers increasingly stimulate partnerships between multiple actors, in which knowledge exchange, joint learning and knowledge co-creation play a central role in reducing the time lag between research findings and their translation into practical outcomes. Yet, despite the growing body of literature on multi-actor and cross-sector learning in these partnerships, an overview of existing literature and a strong evidence base of results of knowledge co-creation in these platforms is missing. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper documents existing evidence of knowledge co-creation processes in multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings reveal, first, many examples of positive results, including increased yields and income for farmers; policy, regime and institutional changes; and changes in environmental sustainability. Second, there are several limitations to what MSPs can achieve, including limited attention for scaling up and a lack of sustainability due to dependency on donor funding. Third, there are limitations related to the evidence base: there is a tendency to report less on failures and available findings on the effectiveness of MSPs are mixed. Considering the evidence base, we conclude that there is a need to systematically document, report and assess MSPs and not take their effectiveness for granted. A systematic literature review thereby has an important added value because the critical assessment of methodological rigour increases the credibility of results documented in the included studies.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural intensification has greatly increased yields but has also negatively affected the environment. The coupling of two agricultural systems (i.e., integrated agriculture-aquaculture or integrated crop-livestock) has been proposed as one of the important ways that reduce the negative effects of agriculture on the environment, but large-scale experimental data are lacking. In this study, we examined the coupled rice-crab system, which is a rapidly developing rice-fish system in China. We conducted a field survey across several rice-planting areas and field and mesocosm experiments to determine whether the rice-crab system achieves high yields of both rice and crab without damaging the environment. Our field survey showed that rice yield was not reduced in the rice-crab system across four rice-growing areas although total fertilizer N was reduced compared to rice monoculture. Our field experiment also showed that the rice-crab treatment produced higher rice yield than rice monoculture treatment with the same fertilizer N application, and that the coupled rice-crab treatment had higher crab yield with less crab numbers of precocious maturation than the crab monoculture treatment with the same amount of feed. Both field and mesocosm experiments showed that the rice-crab system did not cause serious feed-N accumulation in the field. Isotope 15N labeling indicated that rice plants used 7.6% of the feed-N. Dual isotope 13C/15N analysis showed that 59.1% of the food consumed by crabs consisted of organisms that thrived by directly using nutrients in the field. This recycling of N within the field explains the low fertilizer-N input and low effluent-N in the coupled rice-crab system. Our results suggest that the coupling of rice with fish production can achieve synergies between food production systems to reduce environmental impacts per unit of production.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating relationships between the soil food web, soil processes, and agroecosystem function is a critical step toward a more sustainable agriculture. Soil and crop management practices can alter these relationships, and their effects can persist even after imposing new management practices. In 2005, the Cornell Organic Grain Cropping Systems Experiment was established in central New York. Four cropping systems that varied in fertilizer inputs, tillage practices, and weed control were compared: High Fertility, Low Fertility, Enhanced Weed Management, Reduced Tillage. Two crop rotation entry points were included in the experiment. In June 2017, the entire experimental site (plots and alleyways) was plowed and seeded with sorghum sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench x S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf] as part of a uniformity trial to assess legacy effects of past management practices. Prior to initiating the uniformity trial, soil samples were collected and analyzed for soil health indicators. Soil samples were also collected to assess soil invertebrate abundance and community structure 34 and 70 days after planting. Sorghum sudangrass and weed biomass were sampled at the end of the uniformity trial in September 2017. Legacy effects of past management that were observed during the uniformity trial were associated with differences in nutrient inputs and soil disturbance, as well as the preceding crop. The High Fertility system had greater soil phosphorus than the Low Fertility system, and in one of the two crop rotation entry points, soil aggregate stability and soil respiration were greater in the Reduced Tillage system compared to the Enhanced Weed Management system. The Enhanced Weed Management cropping system also had a soil invertebrate community characterized by more disturbance tolerant taxa. Weed biomass varied by crop rotation entry point, but not cropping system. Sorghum sudangrass biomass was greater in the Reduced Tillage system than the Low Fertility system, and the entry point that had greater weed biomass also had greater sorghum sudangrass biomass. Piecewise structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test relationships between response variables and showed that soil phosphorus, soil aggregate stability, and soil respiration explained variation in abundance of some invertebrates, and that aggregate stability, soil respiration, soil moisture, weed biomass, and a select group of invertebrates affected sorghum sudangrass biomass production. Overall our findings show that soil invertebrates can mediate the relationship between soil health indicators and crop productivity, and provide support for including direct measurements of soil invertebrates in soil health assessments.",

    "abstract": "A deeper understanding of how smallholder farmers perceive and manage risks is crucial to identify options that increase farmers' adaptive capacity. We investigated a broad range of risks that play a role in farmers' decision-making processes. In the cotton zone of Mali opportunities and constraints vary with the resource endowment of farms. Furthermore, as households are large in this region, often comprising 20–50 family members, intra-household diversity may influence perceptions and risk management. For this reason, we analysed diversity both among and within farms. Information was gathered through focus group discussions and a survey with 250 people from 58 households. Risk was assessed as the combination of the perceived frequency of occurrence of hazards and the impact on food availability and income. Farmers faced a diversity of risks, with hazards related to animal and personal health, and climate variability of highest concern. Resource endowment of farms was related to risk perception to a limited extent. Differences within the household were related to the generational factor and decision power, and not to gender. Household members with decision power worried most about risks. Almost a quarter of described hazards occurred with a high frequency and led to a high impact on food availability and income. Low resource-endowed farms were more often exposed to high risks than other farm types. Farmers applied a variety of actions to cope with hazards, yet in many cases farmers lacked a response. Medical actions were targeted to human and animal health hazards. Changes in field and animal management practices, adapted consumption rates and calls on social interactions, were combined for a diversity of hazards. By assessing the diversity of risks encountered by farmers and the diversity of risk management actions taken by farmers, this study goes beyond common risk research that focuses on a single hazard. Our results suggest that development interventions should not focus on either agronomic or economic options separately, but combine both to strengthen social well-being and agricultural production.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable Intensification (SI) is essential for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to meet the food demand of the growing population under conditions of increasing land scarcity. However, access to artificial fertilizers is limited, and the current extension system is not effective in serving smallholder farmers. This paper studies farmers' response to improved fertilizer availability under field conditions. Data on farms and families were collected from 267 smallholder farms, while data on fertilizer use and crop response to fertilizer were collected on 127 farm plots. Fertilizer applications and maize yields were measured, and benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of fertilizer application was calculated and to assess its effect on food security. Farm household typologies were used to determine differences in farm endowment and food security classes. Fertilizer application did not significantly improve maize yields in 2017 due to unfavorable weather conditions and pest infestations, whereas significant yield responses were observed in 2018. Consequently, fertilizer application was economically beneficial (BCR >1) for only 45% of the farmers in 2017, compared to 94% in 2018 when 80% of the farmers passed the technology adaptation point (BCR > 2). Surprisingly, economic returns did not vary significantly between household types, implying that fertilizer application provides comparable benefits across all farm types. This is partly explained by the fact that soil fertility varied little between farm types (soil carbon content, for example, showed no correlation with farmer endowment). Still, large differences were observed in farmers' willingness to invest in larger fertilizer applications. Only a small proportion of farmers is expected to increase fertilizer applications as recommended. Our work demonstrates the need to address risks for smallholders and shows that socio-economic aspects are more important than biophysical constraints for policies promoting sustainable intensification.",

This study departs from this by distinguishing three travel time components: travel time to local service center for inputs and services, to dairy delivery point, and to end-markets. Dairy farms in nine villages each in Ethiopia and Kenya were sampled and interviewed along a double proximity gradient. Effects on many production and marketing parameters were measured and compared using regression analysis, to test the hypothesis that intensity of dairy farming and degree of market participation increase with proximity to end-markets and with proximity to local service centers. Findings prove the hypothesis for proximity to local service center, which causes better market quality for inputs and outputs, smaller farms with less available labor, use of more purchased feeds and services, higher stocking rates, higher yields, and higher margins per hectare. Findings only partly prove the hypothesis for proximity to end-markets, mainly due to unexpected land scarcity in the most remote locations. Low productivity and low dairy farming intensity and market participation for remote farms in Ethiopia are attributed to limited and volatile market demand, a coarse milk-collection grid, and low quality of input and service markets, which are largely publicly organized. Implication of this study is that the common typology of dairy farms in '(peri-) urban' and 'rural' farms needs adjustment by outlining local market access and connectivity. 'Remote' rural farms need to be connected to milk collection infrastructure, input shops and services to even have the choice to increase participation in dairy- or other markets.",

    "abstract": "Crop diversification is now well-recognised as a strong lever to address the environmental challenges currently faced by agriculture. Connecting and fostering local exchanges between specialised arable crop and livestock farms can support the diversification of crops and relocate animal feeding with local protein (vs. soya supplements). However, the trade-offs and synergies between individual and collective objectives and performances generated by this system are still largely unknown. Innovative tools that consider the spatiotemporal heterogeneity underpinning the daily functioning of farms are needed to explore the implications of exchange scenarios. To assess self-sufficiency, sustainability and vulnerability at the farm, group (arable vs. livestock) and territorial levels considering the baseline situation and scenarios that increase synergy between arable and livestock farms. We demonstrated the utility of using MAELIA, a spatial agent-based integrated modelling framework, to support iterative design and assessment of self-sufficiency, sustainability and vulnerability of such scenarios. MAELIA was applied to model a collective of five arable and two livestock farmers in western France. In a participatory approach, scientists, agricultural advisers and the farmers co-designed three possible scenarios of legume exchanges. Only the most ambitious scenario based on strong collaboration allowed farmers to reach local protein self-sufficiency while reducing the variability in five of the seven indicators used to assess farm performances. Meeting livestock farms' demand for legumes had a positive influence on socio-economic performance at the territorial level, including an increase in the mean gross margin (of 71 €/ha; 4% higher), decrease in the use of nitrogen fertiliser (of ca. 21 kg N/ha; 11% lower) and decrease in labour time (of ca. 12 min/ha; 5% lower). No major trade-offs between self-sufficiency and vulnerability were observed. However, there were distinct individual performances related to the degree of changes imposed on each farm. We show that by reducing the dependence to external inputs, these systems are promising alternatives to an environmentally sustainable, resilient and economically viable agroecological transition. The development of dedicated institutional support for direct bilateral or multilateral agreements, and specific financial and technical support would encourage farmers to join such initiatives and redesign their farming systems.",

    "abstract": "The use of options for sustainable intensification of smallholder farming in sub-Saharan Africa is often limited by knowledge and resource constraints. To address both constraints, we developed and tested an integrated co-learning approach to improve farm level productivity. The approach was tested by differentiating a group of co-learning farmers and a group of comparison farmers in two locations in western Kenya during five seasons. Both groups received a US$ 100 voucher each growing season and the co-learning group also took part in co-learning activities. The integrated co-learning approach was comprised of four complementary elements: input vouchers, an iterative learning process, common grounds for communication, and complementary knowledge. Central to the approach were co-learning workshops before each season. Workshop topics built on topics from previous seasons and on farmers' feedback and researchers' observations. Activities during each season included farm management monitoring, yield measurements and evaluation interviews. This resulted in multiple learning loops for both farmers and researchers. The voucher fostered learning through increased and diversified input use. For instance, intercropped legumes were smothered by the prolific growth of maize resulting from increased fertilizer use. After setting up joint demonstrations, farmers started to use alternative spacing options for intercropping. Building common ground on concepts and processes governing farm system functioning fostered a deeper understanding by farmers on the suitability of options to their farm and by researchers on locally relevant content. Soil fertility gradients was such a concept through which judicious use of fertilizers was discussed. After five seasons, co-learning farmers had a more diverse and cohesive knowledge of their farm than comparison farmers. Co-learning farmers highlighted farm level management options, management of the parasitic weed striga and options for integrated soil fertility management as the most important things they learned. A tangible learning outcome was the continued increase in groundnut and soybean area among co-learning farmers, which led to more diversified maize cropping systems. We attribute these differences to the co-learning process. Our results demonstrate how the integrated co-learning approach changed both knowledge and practices of participating farmers and researchers. The amplifying effects of the four key elements appeared to be important for enabling sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems.",

    "abstract": "Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the agriculture sector – especially livestock – through low-emission development (LED) has attracted increased global attention. However, producers rarely prioritize emission reduction in their day-to-day practices, resulting in a mismatch between global and national environmental policies and local development interests. This raises the urgency of identifying overlapping solution spaces that would address global and national environmental targets and farmers' production goals. The objective of this study is to identify pathways for scaling LED that better account for divergent smallholder capabilities, strategies, and interests. A multivariate cluster analysis was used to evaluate producer heterogeneity. The analysis utilized data from 1176 household surveys in Tanzania. Informed by these results, stakeholder workshops were held to identify how each group is uniquely constrained in the adoption of LED practices and viable paths forward. Our results reveal six distinct farmer types, distinguishable by their asset base, livestock ownership, cattle breeds, access to market, and income diversity. The six groups presented three levels of LED uptake, high, moderate, and low. Variants of technological packages and market-based interventions, access to better quality inputs, and extension services will be more impactful when correctly matched to producers' asset portfolios, interests, and needs for the high and moderately intensifying producers. However, interventions that address both the knowledge and resource gaps for producers who demonstrate low uptake of LED will be more appropriate. Achieving GHG reduction will be modest from already intensifying groups and the low uptake groups, while moderately intensifying groups present the highest leverage for increased GHG reduction potential. This highlights how taking a food system approach rather than a technological package would be more beneficial especially in targeting groups that are not interested in LED. This study challenges the conceptualization of LED as a simple technological fix. We demonstrate that LED, as currently conceptualized, is not equally accessible or appealing to everyone. Consequently, successful LED uptake is contingent on donor and state ability to match LED strategies, local development priorities, and food systems objectives to develop more targeted needs-driven implementation pathways.",

    "abstract": "Addressing new agricultural challenges may benefit from open communication among field extension agents and other actors who hold relevant expertise, including subject matter specialists and applied researchers. In the context, this article investigates the contribution of two social media messaging platforms, in Ghana, to facilitating open information sharing and interaction amid the emergence of a new pest, fall armyworm. Using thematic content analysis and network analysis, we analysed the types of content exchanged over the platforms, the characteristics of the networks in terms of the involvement of different actors in sending and receiving messages; and through platform user surveys established how such interaction patterns were influenced by social relations, self-representational interests and organisational set-ups and rules. The results indicate that both social media platforms are characterised by relatively centralised network and communication structures, suggesting that participation in especially sending messages is non-egalitarian. Such structural features are not conducive to complex knowledge and problem solving processes such as knowledge integration and joint problem solving. In line with this, the analysis of the actual knowledge and problem solving processes taking place demonstrated that the platforms were used more for knowledge and information dissemination as well as for the distribution of notifications in support of organisational coordination. Our investigations show that social hierarchies, organisational rules and tactics related to identity management influenced these patterns of interaction and posed constraints to open knowledge and information sharing. Nevertheless, the platforms play meaningful roles in supporting knowledge processes, and are likely to generate useful input for knowledge integration and collaborative problem solving in complementary face-to-face settings. The study contributes to an emerging research area that relates social media (other than Facebook) to knowledge sharing, problem solving and broader forms of collaboration in professional spaces, in the African agricultural context.",

    "abstract": "The effective control of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, mainly caused by the toxigenic fungus Fusarium graminearum, has a significant impact on food safety worldwide. As maize is one of the main hosts of F. graminearum, the risk of infection by this plant pathogen is highest when wheat is grown after maize and infected crop residues are not buried through ploughing. This study aimed to investigate the agronomic and economic viability of two innovative cropping systems with the goal to reduce the risk of FHB and mycotoxins in subsequent wheat. These systems were maize-intercropping and cover cropping with different plant species before the wheat growing season under reduced tillage practices. For the maize-intercropping study, red clover, sudangrass, phacelia, white mustard and Indian mustard were used as intercrops with grain maize and compared with a sole maize crop in a grain maize-winter wheat rotation under no-tillage or reduced tillage. For the cover cropping study, white mustard, Indian mustard and winter pea were used as interval cover crops in a silage maize-spring wheat rotation under no-tillage and compared with treatments without a cover crop, i.e. herbicide or plough applied after silage maize. The incidence of Fusarium head blight causing species and the accumulation of mycotoxins in grains of wheat as well as the crop yield were monitored. In addition, an economic assessment was conducted by calculating the receipts, operating costs and gross margin for each cropping system. Growing intercrops with maize or interval cover crops in a maize-wheat rotation under reduced tillage decreased mycotoxins in wheat while maintaining wheat yield. The use of white mustard or Indian mustard as intercrops reduced deoxynivalenol in winter wheat by up to 52% compared with maize grown as a sole crop. The use of white mustard, Indian mustard or winter pea as interval cover crops also reduced deoxynivalenol and improved yield in spring wheat by up to 85% and 25%, respectively. Remarkably, the toxin reduction through these cover crops was comparable with that obtained by ploughing. However, due to increased operating costs, we observed economic trade-offs in these innovative cropping systems, i.e. 7–25% reduced gross margin over the entire rotation. Both cereal growers and consumers can benefit from the recommended practices, which considerably lower the risk of mycotoxin contamination in harvest products while maintaining crop yield. To address the economic trade-offs, policy makers should support innovation in cropping systems, enhancing food safety while also ensuring the economic viability of cereal production systems.",

    "abstract": "The seasonal break is a rainfall event that has traditionally initiated sowing and enabled plant establishment in Mediterranean-type environments. Despite its importance to crop production, neither the pattern of the seasonal break, nor the impact of recent autumn rainfall decline in eastern Australia on the pattern has been quantified at a national scale. Adaptive strategies to remove reliance on the seasonal break for crop establishment can include combinations of novel genotypes and innovative crop management. This paper (i) shows how seasonal changes may be altering the pattern of sowing opportunities across southern Australia, and (ii) evaluates the potential for adaptive management to deal with these changes using a case-study in southern Australia involving early, deep-sown wheat cultivars with long coleoptiles to reduce the dependence on the seasonal break for successful crop establishment. In the first part of the study, the timing of the seasonal break across the southern Australian cropping regions was determined using the sum of a 7-day rolling mean rainfall to evaporation ratio > 1 to trigger a sowing opportunity between 1 March and 30 July using long-term (1971–2018) gridded (0.05° × 0.05°) historical climate data. The relationship between early-season climatic conditions and adaptive management options was then evaluated using a growth chamber experiment and a field experiment in a Mediterranean-type environment to evaluate the factors leading to successful establishment of earlier deeply sown wheat cultivars with long coleoptiles. The analysis revealed spatial and seasonal variability with the earliest median seasonal break (27-March) in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, and the latest (3-June) in Western Australia (WA). The largest shift in seasonal break was a 17-day advance in the Mallee and Sandplain of WA, and an 11-day delay in Central NSW during the period 1990–2018. Evaluation of the factors controlling establishment of a long coleoptile wheat cultivar suggested that soil temperatures in the early sowing windows were unlikely to reduce coleoptile length, but seeding depth, soil type and water availability will play an important role on emergence. In summary, the shifts in the climatic conditions at the break of the growing season have not been the same across the southern cropping region. Adaptations for this climatic shift such as long-coleoptile, deep-sowing strategies for wheat show significant promise but careful consideration of soil factors is required to ensure success and to improve on-farm decision making regarding its use.",

    "abstract": "Soil acidification affects crop yields which can diminish farmers' incomes. Whilst soil pH can easily be increased by application of lime, in practice application must be economically viable with yield benefits offering an acceptable return on investments. Liming is a long-term investment with benefits becoming apparent over multiple years. Long-term economic strategies can be problematic for farmers who lack investment capital and who may have short-term decision time frames, such as most smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, application of lime causes substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (especially CO2). It is currently unclear how liming affects GHG emissions per tonne of maize, in cases where liming increases crop yields. In this study, we assessed if liming acid soils is economically and environmentally viable at different levels of intensification for maize cultivation in Western Kenya. First, a meta-analysis using a regression analysis was conducted to quantify effects of lime application on soil pH and maize yields based on 26 field experiments. Related effects on farm profit and and returns on investment were estimated for a period of five years for soils with varying levels of initial soil pH and fertiliser application. Finally, synergies and trade-offs were assessed between maize yields, economic benefits and GHG emissions. Liming consistently increased maize yields on soils with an initial soil pH between 4.0 and 5.7 in Western Kenya, with or without fertiliser use. For a soil pH of 5, applying 2 t ha−1 lime resulted in a significant increase in maize yields of 57% (from 2.3 to 3.6 t ha −1) in the first year after application. Despite these positive effects on yield, associated profits – when including costs of labour - were only positive when liming was combined with fertiliser (N,P) application. While liming causes substantial GHG emissions per tonne lime applied, these were offset when expressing GHG emissions per tonne of grain maize, due to the observed yield increases. The pay-back period for lime investments was at least two years. Our analysis shows that liming has potential co-benefits for food security and the environment in tropical acid soils, but we expect uptake by farmers to be unlikely without external incentives, at least in Western Kenya.",

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for food and the threat from climate change, increasing grain yields with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an important target. Yet, the quantitative effects of climate change and management practices on yield and global warming potential (GWP) of rice-winter wheat rotations are still uncertain. To investigate the key factors influencing the tradeoffs between yield and GHG of rice-winter wheat ecosystems in mid-eastern China over the two periods. In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to examine the spatio-temporal county-scale variations in yields of rice-winter wheat rotations and associated GHG (CH4, N2O) and GHG intensity (GHGI) over two periods (1980–1989, 2010–2019) in mid-eastern China. The DNDC model is driven by a county-scale database, consisting of meteorological data (79 stations), soil properties, management practice, and crop parameters for 213 counties. Eight scenarios were defined to isolate the individual and combined impacts of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices on yields, GWP, and GHGI. Results revealed that the total yield increased by 48.7% over the two periods but stagnated in the 2010s; the average emission rate of CH4 and N2O in the two periods were 250.7, 196, 0.63 and 2.83 kg ha−1, respectively, while GWP and GHGI declined by 12.8% and 38.3%. The individual contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to the GHGI of the rice-winter wheat rotations were 37%, −42.5%, and 16.4%, respectively. Adoption of new cultivars was a decisive factor for improving yields and mitigating GHG, while climate change and management practices had a minor influence on yields. The negative responses of yield to improved management practices (i.e., high N fertilization, mid-season drainage) were mainly attributed to soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density variations and different fertilization patterns. The combination of new cultivars adoption and management practices decreased GHGI by 46.6%. These findings demonstrate the importance of high-yield crop varieties to low carbon agriculture, and that management practices should be adapted to local conditions and specific crop varieties. Given that the crop harvest index is approaching its theoretical upper limit and that promoting new varieties presents many challenges, future innovations should focus on introducing optimal strategies that balance the tradeoffs between yield and GHG emissions to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Potato is an essential food staple and a critical crop for rural livelihoods in the Republic of Georgia, where many phytosanitary risks threaten production. The objectives of this study were, first, to characterize the current seed and ware potato transaction network, value chain, varietal adoption, and phytosanitary risks for Georgia. Second, we modeled scenarios for the spread of an emerging pathogen, Synchytrium endobioticum, in Georgia as part of a geographic risk assessment analysis. Third, we coupled risk estimated in our simulation experiments with risk of reintroduction or invasion of pathogens via international trade or habitat connectivity. We found that a majority of seed potato is obtained from local sources in Georgia, and is of unknown phytosanitary quality. An expert elicitation workshop was held to characterize the potato value chain as well as potato production more generally in the Republic of Georgia. To characterize future risk of pathogen spread through Georgia we leveraged epidemic network analysis, an analysis of potato cropland connectivity, and an evaluation of international potato trade in a multi-step risk assessment. Five varieties, including the variety Jelly, made up 65% of planted area throughout the country. Several pathogens and pests were listed as contributing to annual yield loss with S. endobioticum, causing potato wart, identified as the greatest emerging risk to the country. Through simulation analyses of potential spread scenarios within country, we identified municipalities in Adjara and Samtskhe-Javakheti to be at particularly high risk for introduction of potato wart and we recommend enhanced surveillance in these regions. Our analysis of cropland connectivity revealed that the region where Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia meet are at a high risk for local spread of seedborne pathogens such as S. endobioticum. We propose these locations as targets for enhanced surveillance and mitigation strategies. We introduce these methods as a general framework for the rapid assessment of phytosanitary risks of regional seed systems, especially where information available to guide interventions is scarce.",

    "abstract": "The desire for agricultural mechanisation is mainstreaming across the Global South, yet there are limited tools through which to monitor and estimate progress made in pursuit of this. Despite Nepal enacting an agricultural development agenda focused on mechanisation to address issues of productivity, labour scarcity, inclusive economic growth and sustainability, it remains one of the few places in South Asia that is yet to see substantial agricultural mechanisation rates. We use this scenario as a case study to propose and investigate adoption processes. This research aims to provide a baseline to understand progress made towards Agri-mechanisation on the Nepal Terai. Despite decades of promotional efforts, there are only limited comprehensive analyses of the status of agricultural mechanisation in Nepal that cover diverse machinery and go beyond binary adoption estimates, nor a framework to understand different types of (non-)adopters. The applied non-binary 'Stepwise Process of Mechanisation' framework provides a systematic process for investigation of the status of agricultural mechanisation on the Nepal Terai. This framework is applied to representative survey data from 14 districts across 1569 households from Nepal's Plains (Terai) region. Results suggest that decades of activity have not yet led to the substantial closure of exposure gaps, nor sufficient ownership of machines that enables accessible fee-for-hire service provision. Exposure gaps were substantial in all machines, meaning current demonstration programs may not be achieving their targeted outcomes. Across nearly all machinery, a primary reason for limited progression to sustained adoption was a lack of service providers, a manifestation of limited machinery ownership, meaning current broad subsidy programs aimed at procurement may not be achieving intended outcomes. However, substantial pools of potential adopters and concentration of supply-side constraints highlight that with targeted intervention, rapid rural mechanisation is possible in the near future on the Nepal Terai. This research provides a foundation on which to understand the progress made towards small holder agricultural mechanisation. For the first time in South Asia, a systematic analysis through a novel stepwise framework has clarified and updated the status of agricultural mechanisation on the Nepal Terai. This work also lays the foundation for future work to explore the drivers, implications and inclusiveness of agri-mechanisation, utilising the identified typologies, both in Nepal and more broadly where increased nuance in understanding the status of agricultural mechanisation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The Greater Mekong Subregion has been undergoing rapid agricultural transformation over the last decades, as traditional diverse subsistence-oriented agriculture is evolving towards intensified commercial production systems. Negative environmental impacts often include deforestation, nutrient pollution, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study aims to explore the potential of crop-livestock integration to mitigate trade-offs between economic and environmental impacts of smallholder farming systems at different stages of agricultural transition and degrees of agricultural diversity across the Greater Mekong Subregion. We chose a 'middle ground' between detailed modeling of few, representative farming systems and modeling of large household populations. 24 low and high diversity farms were selected in Laos (Xieng Khouang province), Cambodia (Ratanakiri province) and Vietnam (Central Highlands) from a survey dataset of 1300 households. These farming systems were simulated with the whole-farm bio-economic and multi-objective optimization model FarmDESIGN, calculating operating profit, GHG emissions and nitrogen (N) balance. Two optimizations ('business as usual' vs. 'crop-livestock integration') were performed, generating 'solution spaces' or alternative configurations aiming to maximize profitability, keep farm N balanced and minimize GHG emissions. Agricultural systems across the sites differed in their production orientation and management practices, representing various stages of agricultural transition. Nitrogen balances varied between sites, being negative in Ratanakiri (average − 20.5 kg N ha−1 y−1) and Xieng Khouang (−36.5 kg N ha−1 y−1) and positive in the Central Highlands (73 kg N ha−1 y−1). Negative balances point to unsustainable mining of nutrients due to sale of cash crops without sufficient inputs, and positive balances to the risk of environmental contamination. Total GHG emissions ranged from 0.52–8.12 t CO2e ha−1 and were not significantly impacted by stage of agricultural transformation or agricultural diversity. GHG sources in Ratanakiri and Xieng Khouang were determined by crop residue burning while in Central Highlands fertilizer and livestock were main emitters. High diversity farms obtained higher operating profits (10,379 USD y−1) than low diversity farms (4584 USD y−1). Crop-livestock integration, a combination of measures including introduction of improved forages grasses, manure recycling and residue feeding, and reduction of residue burning, resulted in larger 'solution spaces', thus providing farmers with more options to mitigate agro-environmental trade-offs. These findings underline the potential of crop-livestock integration to support sustainable intensification pathways in the Greater Mekong region. Public and private investment in further research and extension is needed to develop and scale context-specific crop-livestock integration practices.",

    "abstract": "Feed insecurity caused by increases in animal inventories and variability in feed production due to climate change is an emerging issue in livestock production. Regional feed transfers are one strategy used to address local feed shortages and minimize feed insecurity. This study assessed the importance of regional feed transfers for beef production in Alberta, Canada, by estimating regional feed production and demand based on livestock (beef, dairy, poultry, swine, sheep, bison, and horses) numbers and categories, enabling calculation of regional deficits and surpluses. Transfers from crop-producing regions in Alberta were estimated to address potential feed shortages for beef production in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. The analysis included feeds that could be cost-effectively transported, namely, barley grain, wheat grain, grass hay, and grass-legume hay. Feed demands of beef and other livestock were estimated at the county level and aggregated to seven land-use framework (LUF) regions. Feed balances available for beef production were estimated for the four feeds based on crop yields in each year. Feed transfers from surplus to deficit LUF regions were hierarchically estimated based on transport distance. Feed inputs from outside the province were not considered in the analysis due to the lack of data on cross-boundary imports. The average feed demand for beef production between 2001 and 2016 in Alberta was 2.71, 0.68, 2.21, and 1.95 M tonnes of dry matter (DM) for barley grain, wheat grain, grass hay, and grass-legume hay, respectively. The results indicated that the South Saskatchewan region of Alberta had the greatest feed deficit and required transfers from other regions in all years. Feed balances were consistently negative in this region between 2001 and 2016, with barley grain ranging from −97.2% to −34.2% (deficit), wheat grain from −31.4% (deficit) to 19.3% (surplus), grass hay from −147.2% (deficit) to 1.6% (surplus), and native grass-legume hay from −167.7% to −15.7% (deficit). Unmet demand of barley grain (2006), grass hay (2001) and grass-legume hay (2001, 2006) at the provincial level were likely met by importing these feedstuffs from outside of the province. The methodology presented here can be adapted to other intensive livestock producing regions to assess feed security issues associated with climate change and devise effective feed transfer strategies and provide information that can be used for future consideration of the regional impact of these practices on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, as well as other environmental indices.",

    "abstract": "Smallholder cocoa agroforestry systems provide most of the cocoa produced world-wide and can improve the livelihoods of rural families in the tropics. However, many smallholder cocoa producers experience low cocoa yields due to generally poor management practices, pests, disease, and low soil fertility. In Papua New Guinea, pest and disease management systems have been developed to provide improved yields and revenues, but there has been limited uptake. We hypothesized that the low uptake of these systems may be due to the improved yields not being sufficient to justify the required increase in labour and capital inputs. Our objective was to assess if the integrated pest and disease management systems were financially viable. Our methods involved developing discounted cash flow models that incorporated Monte Carlo risk analysis software. We populated the models with labour inputs, costs, and revenue data collected in country, and from scientific literature. In addition to net present value, we evaluated the production systems with additional criteria we deemed appropriate for assessing the required labour inputs and capital outlays; return on labour; mean labour hours/day; mean annual capital outlays, mean hourly income, and mean annual income. Our results show that under the current cocoa prices being received, all the production systems had a negative net present value, and a mean hourly income that was below the Papua New Guinea minimum wage and less than 1 USD/h. Furthermore, the progressive addition of labour inputs and capital outlays of the pest and disease management systems resulted in mean hourly incomes that are less than currently being received. These decreased hourly earnings may explain the low adoption of these technologies. Financial analyses of new smallholder agroforestry technologies should be used to evaluate the viability and likelihood of smallholder technology adoption. Previous research on cocoa pest and disease management systems failed to account for costs related to labour and capital inputs. Even if farm family labour does not incur a direct cash outflow, it does represent an opportunity cost to farmers. Including additional criteria that measure financial returns to farmers relative to labour and capital requirements should be a part these assessments. These additional criteria can aid in evaluating all the economic thresholds that may impact if and how smallholders will incorporate new agroforestry technologies, which can help improve the success for agriculture-based development projects throughout the global tropics.",

    "abstract": "The key European Union (EU) policy instrument in support of innovation in agriculture, forestry and related sectors is the European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability. It applies the 'interactive innovation model' which brings together actors with complementary types of knowledge. This policy instrument is implemented inter alia through multi-actor projects funded via the Horizon 2020 (H2020) Research and Innovation (R&I) programme. Although the multi-actor H2020 projects account for a substantial part of EU project funding for agriculture, forestry and related sector R&I, systematic and comparative research on the multi-actor H2020 projects is scarce. This is partly due to a lack of a structured analytical approach to accommodate the differences in institutional, cultural and social contexts which influence the co-innovation and social learning processes in these multinational, multi-actor partnerships. To this end, we argue that the analytical integration of the micro- and macro-level innovation system (IS) perspectives is necessary to understand fully the mechanisms underlying the functioning of, and the co-innovation process within, multi-actor H2020 projects. This analytical gap is addressed with the development of an integrated, Multi-level Innovation System framework (MINOS) and its application to 50 multi-actor H2020 projects. MINOS recognises the presence, influence of and interaction between multiple levels of IS in such projects. We distinguish four levels of IS: the European Agricultural Innovation System (EU AIS), the National Agricultural Innovation System (NAIS), the H2020 project and the partner organisations involved in the project (Partner). Our analysis of the system failures that occurred across most of the 50 cases allowed us to identify and conceptualise two categories of 'multi-level system failures', namely multipliers and stackers, and the presence of mitigating factors. The MINOS analytical framework enabled a) a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of co-innovation in multi-actor H2020 projects and b) contributed to addressing the theoretical and conceptual gaps in terms of studying the interconnection and interdependence of different IS levels.",

    "abstract": "Studies in the Andes have demonstrated that seed degeneration of potato occurred in experimental conditions, but was negligible in farmers' conditions. There are two hypotheses for this difference: (1) farmers cultivate resistant varieties, or (2) they use on-farm practices that can manage seed degeneration. Farmers may replace some of the seed saved from their fields with outside seed, but it is an open question what level of benefit farmers experience from partial replacement. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the cultivated varieties, the on-farm seed management practices, and seed replacement in potato seed degeneration. Moreover, this study evaluated the potential effect of partial replacement of the farmers' seed lot each season with healthy seed, compared to less frequent nearly full replacement, in simulations. We surveyed farmers in the Cotopaxi province, Ecuador, in 2008, 2010, and 2018, and performed a study on the incidence of pathogens and pests in farmers' seed lots in 2018. We also evaluated the potential effects of the timing of replacement of farmers' seed lots by healthy seed to manage degeneration, applying the seedHealth model. We found that farmers experience no or only slow degeneration in their varieties. Analysing yield data reported by farmers to detect degeneration, we did not detect yield declines. The type of variety and year of data collection explained the variation in yield. These results seem to confirm the hypothesis that varieties cultivated in the Andes are resistant to the impact of seed degeneration on yield, and that seed degeneration depends on the agroecological conditions present within a cropping season or year. Because we did not find an impact on yield, we hypothesized that on-farm practices affect seed-borne pathogens and pests causing seed degeneration. We identified multiple on-farm practices playing a role in the process of seed degeneration: they either slowed down or accelerated this process depending on the seed-borne pathogen and pest causing seed degeneration. Our scenario analyses using the seedHealth model showed how replacing farmers' seed lots by healthy seed could usefully reduce seed degeneration compared to using the same amount of seed to periodically replace nearly all seed in a season. Our results showed that on-farm practices are also critical drivers in the process of seed degeneration. This study demonstrated the importance of considering on-farm seed management practices (i.e., use of cultivated varieties) to strengthen seed systems interventions aiming to manage potato seed degeneration. Additionally, this study showed the potential of partially replacing farmers' seed with healthy seed as an alternative when complete seed replacement is not an option.",

    "abstract": "In the Middle Ages, the Muslims introduced communal water management in the Iberian Peninsula. Some irrigation systems of medieval origin are still in operation in the mountainous areas of Southern Spain. Snowmelt runoff is diverted during spring from high-altitude streams into contoured recharge ditches that convey the water to areas of high infiltration (shallow aquifers). This regulates and delays discharge into the main river, from which downstream flow is diverted, during late spring and summer, to irrigation ditches that supply terraces and fields on river plains. The Busquístar irrigation ditch and its irrigation scheme comprise one of these ancient systems. 1) To characterize the Busquístar system, its water source and regulation, its water users' association, its multi-functionality, and its quality as a nature-based solution for water security. 2) To review the irrigation efficiency concept applied to the restoration of ancient irrigation systems, taking into account their ecosystem services. i) Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders to evaluate irrigation system operation and perceptions of multi-functionality; ii) field surveys for description of the irrigation ditch and its riparian flora; iii) satellite imagery for quantifying riparian vegetation; iv) water balance for irrigation efficiency computation. Crop production is the main function of the Busquístar irrigation scheme but additional ecosystem services are creation of landscape and biodiversity. Eight riparian plant communities were distinguished along the irrigation ditch. The discharge measured at its head on 23 July and 3 September 2017 represented 14 and 50% of the mean river flow in July and September, respectively. The flow measured at the first bifurcation of the ditch was about half that at the head, revealing the proportion filtered along its 6470-m long conveyance reach. The remaining flow was then diverted to 4 branches along the 3140-m long distribution reach proportionally to the irrigable area in each branch. Return flows and irrigation efficiency were estimated for the two measuring dates considering riparian and crop evapotranspiration. The estimated efficiency was highly dependent on which water uses were considered beneficial and on the scale of analysis, field, entire system or watershed. The study revealed the integrated approach behind the traditional water management in these ancient systems. The article proposes a review of the irrigation efficiency concept that allows reconciling the character of a nature-based solution with the current restoration of the system, responding to the needs of the emerging export horticulture in the area.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing the sustainability of grazing livestock farming systems in the drylands at the farm and household or territorial levels (in terms of food security, well-being, value chain performance, feed supply, and maintenance of common grazing resources) constitutes a major challenge in the context of global changes. In particular, social–natural interdependency in an entanglement of spatial and temporal scales complicates the development of a common and systematic framework for assessing the sustainability of these grazing livestock systems. Our objective is to give an overview of some fundamental sets of indicators usually used and elaborate on some principles to guide the sustainable assessment of grazing livestock systems in drylands. To do so, this paper reviews a set of empirical, theoretical, and methodological studies related to the analysis of risk, adaptability, vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability of livestock systems in drylands based on grazing (mostly pastoral systems, but also some integrated crop-livestock systems). More concretely, this review seeks to compile a set of indicators to inform the processes of assessing the sustainability of livestock socio-ecosystems. It points to the wide range of approaches that have been used to address the sustainability of grazing livestock systems, ranging from those that focus on ecological or social approaches to more integrated and systemic approaches; from indicator-based approaches to those focusing on processes; from quantitative approaches to those that point out the need to take qualitative aspects into consideration; and from research-based assessments to participatory approaches. Based on this review, we propose a multi-scale indicators framework combining scales of space, time, and coordination to address the sustainability of these livestock systems. This framework aims to constitute a sound basis for elaborating a system of information that will contribute to and support policymakers and development agencies in developing their policies and measurements in order to ensure the sustainable development of pastoral and agropastoral systems in the short and medium-term. However, this study also warns about the multiple contextual scopes of the indicators and their implications, which reveal differing dynamics (and therefore adaptive capacities) of these systems.",

    "abstract": "The dairy sector has undergone profound transformation over recent decades, resulting in considerably fewer but larger and more specialised farms, with unclear implications across sustainability dimensions. The objective was to develop and employ a framework for assessing sustainability in the Swedish dairy sector to shed light on how recent historical developments (1990–2020) have influenced sustainability outcomes. Using a data-driven, multidisciplinary approach, main areas of concern for sustainability in the primary production stages of the dairy sector were identified. These were then populated with indicators to track developments over time and highlight synergies and trade-offs. Four areas of concern were identified and populated with eight indicators (listed in brackets): 'supporting ecosystems' (semi-natural grassland area, ley area, mean field size), 'climate impact' (methane from enteric fermentation), 'animal welfare' (veterinary treatments, percentage of culled cows due to diseases) and 'farm viability' (competitive wages, farmer age structure). The results showed that area of semi-natural grassland per dairy cow decreased by 27% from 2003 to 2020. Area of ley per cow decreased slightly but the proportion of arable land on dairy farms devoted to ley cultivation increased, due to improved roughage quality enabling an increase in proportion of roughage in feed rations. In terms of climate impact, enteric methane emissions per kg milk decreased by 21%. Regarding animal welfare, veterinary treatments of diseases decreased from 45% to 21% over the 30 years, with declining trends for most recorded diseases except hoof disease. The indicators for farm viability showed that the average dairy farm was unable to pay a wage comparable to the national average throughout most of the period 2004–2020, but a slightly positive trend was observed, although with large year-on-year variability. A rapid change in age structure was seen between 2003 and 2020, with the proportion of land managed by older farmers (+60 years) increasing from 12% to 22%, indicating challenges with demographic viability. Tracking changes over time across sustainability dimensions gives important insights into improvements made and challenges that remain to be solved. Overall, developments in the Swedish dairy sector have diminished its capacity to support ecosystems, particularly related to semi-natural grasslands, while reducing its climate impacts and improving animal welfare. An increased specialisation has also resulted in spillover effects where services and impacts have shifted from dairy herds to specialised beef herds. These findings are important in navigating policy processes targeting developments in the dairy sector.",

    "abstract": "Integrating cover crop mixtures into dryland crop-fallow rotations may foster ecological intensification by enhancing ecosystem function multifunctionality compared with conventional fallows and monoculture cover crops. However, the expression of functional traits in cover crop mixtures is influenced by arrays of agronomic and environmental filters that differently influence cover crop performance. To (1) determine the identity and diversity effects of different cover crop functional types on ecosystem functions and trade-offs, and (2) determine the optimal cover crop mixture that maximizes ecosystem function multifunctionality in a subtropical dryland environment. Using three-site-year field experiments, we assessed if cover crop mixtures enhanced ecosystem function multifunctionality (MF) above that of monoculture cover crops and conventional fallow. We measured a range of ecosystem functions as indicators of three major ecosystem service categories: 1) provisioning services (biomass production, cash crop yield, and profitability); 2) supporting services (weed suppression, soil active carbon accrual, soil aggregate distribution, nitrogen (N) mineralization, N supply, and N retention); and 3) regulating services (parasitic nematode suppression, promotion of free-living nematodes, soil respiration, and soil water conservation). We found greater suite of ecosystem functions following mixture cover crops compared to monocultures, likely due to synergistic trait combinations that increased ecosystem function multifunctionality. The legume and forage brassica monocultures had consistently low multifunctionality (MF < 0.5). The oat:legume mixture resulted in the highest multifunctionality (MF > 0.5), driven by moderate water use and aboveground biomass production, and high groundcover residency, thus favouring higher cash crop yields and system profitability. They also generated overall improvements in soil health by providing additional carbon inputs, increasing the proportion of larger soil aggregates, and improving soil food web structure. We predicted the optimum cover crop mixture to maximize ecosystem function multifunctionality was 64% oat, 36% legume and 0% forage brassica. This study offers novel insight into the agronomic and environmental impacts of replacing fallow with cover crops in a subtropical dryland. It shows that integrating mixture of oat:legume cover crops can increase multifunctionality. Further research is required on the extent of ecosystem trade-offs between competing ecosystem functions. The predicted optimum cover crop mixture composition will likely vary when different ecosystem functions are considered or if long-term experiment data are used. Hence, the recommended optimum cover crop mixture must be interpreted with caution and cover crop selection should be based on practical recommendations according to target management goals.",

    "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the climatic and biophysical potential to grow the crops it needs to meet rapidly growing food demand; however, agricultural productivity remains low. While potential maize yields in Zambia are 9 t per hectare (t/ha), the average farmer produces only 1–2. We evaluate the contribution of responses to weather risk to that gap by decomposing the yield gap in maize in Zambia. While we know that improved seed and fertilizer can expand yield and profit, they may also increase the variance of yield under different weather outcomes, reducing their adoption. We use a novel approach combining crop modeling and statistical analysis of survey data to obtain the yield gap components in Zambia driven by input cost and input risk. We use a crop model to simulate district-level marginal effects of fertilizer and seed maturity choice on the mean and variance of expected yield and profit under all-weather outcomes for each district for the past 30 years. We compare input levels that maximize expected yield to those that maximize expected profit and maximize the expected mean-variance trade-off assuming risk-aversion. To determine how much farmers' input choices are made to reduce risk, we then quantify differences in the expected riskiness of inputs by district. We find approximately one-quarter of the yield gap can be explained by risk-reducing behavior, albeit with a substantial geographic variation. Given this finding, under present conditions, we expect that the average maximum yield that farmers can obtain without increasing risk is 6.75 t/ha compared to a potential profit-maximizing level of 8.84 t/ha. The risk-related yield gap is only expected to increase with weather extremes driven by climate change. Promoting \"one-size-fits all\" solutions to closing the yield gap could underestimate the effect of risk mitigation on agricultural production while increasing farmers' risk exposure.",

    "abstract": "There is a diversity of sheep production systems in the United States (US), from intensive operations which house animals year-round with concentrated feeding to extensive operations that practice transhumance grazing with minimal inputs. The main objective of this study was to quantify the amount and variability of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from four distinct production categories that typify US sheep production: Intensive, Intensive Grazing, Extensive Grazing, and Range. An additional objective was to compare emissions estimates produced via three different methods for determining methane (CH4) production and nitrogen (N) excretion. A cradle to farm gate life cycle analysis (LCA) was conducted on 17 sheep operations to determine their GHG emissions for producing sheep and wool. An LCA was also conducted on four feedlots to determine emissions related to finishing lamb from Range operations. The more intensive operations kept ewes for less time on pasture, purchased more feeds, and produced more weaned lambs/ewe/year (P < 0.01). Emissions intensity was lower (P < 0.05) in more intensive operations and ranged from 12.8 to 20.1 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)/kg lamb liveweight (LW) or 10.5–13.3 kg CO2e/kg sheep LW. Enteric CH4 was the major source of GHG across all categories, with the proportion of GHG as enteric CH4 declining from most extensive (79%) to most intensive (46%) categories. More intensive operations emitted 44% more kg N2O/sheep LW and 67% more CO2/kg sheep LW than more extensive ones. Breeding ewes accounted for over 60% of total enteric CH4 emissions across all categories. Incorporating a Feedlot component for Range lambs resulted in an emissions intensity of 15.1 kg CO2e/kg lamb LW, 25% lower than that at the Range farm gate. The number of lambs weaned/ewe/year accounted for the greatest variation in emissions intensity on a lamb LW basis (37%), followed by ewe replacement rate (27%), while on a sheep LW basis, age at first breeding accounted for 56% of variation. Yearly ewe enteric CH4 emissions and N excretion were higher using the NRC and the IPCC Tier 2 methods compared to the IPCC Tier 1 method (P < 0.001). Ewe productivity was the main driver of GHG emissions intensity in diverse US sheep production systems; therefore, its improvement will be crucial in reducing emissions. Further gains in extensive operations can be realized by a reduction in preweaning mortality while intensive operations have opportunities to improve manure management and utilize feeds produced with lower GHG emissions.",

    "abstract": "Amid an uncertain future with increasing environmental, economic, social, and institutional challenges, farmers in Germany need to find strategies to become more resilient through capacities of robustness, adaptability, and transformability. Parallel to that, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), an alternative food and value chain network in which producers and consumers share the risks involved in farming, is rapidly spreading in the country. CSA has the potential to address sustainability concerns while at the same time improving farm resilience. The main objective of this study is to provide an understanding of how a CSA-structure on a farm may impact farm resilience. It also aims to investigate how CSA farmers in Germany perceive the resilience of their farms, its functions, and the challenges they may face in the future. A mixed methodology was applied, consisting of a case study with one CSA farmer following the approach for a resilience assessment developed by Meuwissen et al. (2019), and a survey with CSA farmers from Germany. The case study involved an in-depth interview, a resilience perception assessment and a Fuzzy-Cognitive-Mapping workshop, whose results were used as a starting point for developing the survey. The case study revealed mechanisms for improving farm resilience through CSA, particularly through increased income security, risk protection, market independence, and satisfaction. These same resilience improving mechanisms could also be identified among the surveyed CSA farmers. Overall, CSA farmers showed a high level of perceived resilience in comparison to non-CSA farmers from a similar survey in a different study. The study is the first of its kind to analyze CSA farmers in Germany through the lens of farm resilience theory. The study provides first insights to how transitioning to CSA affects the perceived resilience of farmers as well as underlying motivations. The results provide a strong indication that CSA could offer a viable strategy to help combat the resilience crisis, shedding thus a positive light on the current spread of the movement in Germany.",

    "abstract": "The UK Climate Change Committee has recommended a 64% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture and land-use sector to meet the 2050 Net Zero target in the UK. However, it is unclear how this reduction can be achieved at a farm level. Using detailed real farm data and novel modelling approaches, we investigated the management interventions and afforestation that would be required to deliver Net Zero within the farm boundary. Baseline carbon footprints were calculated for twenty Welsh beef and sheep farms using the Agrecalc carbon calculator, whilst carbon sequestration was estimated using Bangor University's Carbon Footprinting Tool. Scenarios were created to determine the emissions reductions achievable on each farm through implementation of cost-effective mitigation measures. Mitigation measures and their abatement potentials were sourced from the most recent UK Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, which allow emissions to be reduced mostly through improvements in efficiency thus maintaining the production of the system. Area footprints were calculated for production, with and without offset (afforested) areas needed to achieve Net Zero. Emission reductions following the implementation of cost-effective mitigation measures averaged 28% across all farms, ranging from 19 to 35%. The woodland needed to offset the remaining emissions to achieve Net Zero ranged from 8 to 85% of the farm area, with an average 38%. This offset area was equivalent to on average 17.4 m2.yr kg−1 deadweight (carcass weight). Apparent area efficiency decreased when the offset area was accounted for, however, the ranking of farms in terms of efficiency was largely unaffected. Mitigation scenarios rely on several assumptions and these need to be refined to accurately inform Net Zero pathways. Based on the results for these study farms, our modelling indicates that even after implementation of ambitious mitigation across beef and sheep farms, large-scale land use change will be required to achieve Net Zero at an individual farm-level. However, this reform could lead to the unintended consequence of displacing production to less efficient systems and increase overall emissions. Instead, we advocate a combined approach of carbon and land footprints that could help to identify farms on which either food production or carbon removals should be prioritised to move the industry towards achieving Net Zero at a sectoral, regional or national level.",

    "abstract": "During the last thirty years, many farmers and collective irrigation institutions have replaced their traditional gravity irrigation systems with modern drip irrigation systems, as a result of a water-saving policy promoted by numerous states and international organisations. The scientific-technical paradigm that associated water-savings with this process of technological change has collapsed in the last two decades and has led to a change in the position of international organisations. In this research, we focus on the process of drip irrigation adoption in the Acequia Real del Júcar (València, Spain). We analyse how the estimation and allocation of the expected water savings have changed in the different water planning instruments, and how it has been perceived by the different actors involved in this process. The research has also focused on the co-design and assessment of different measures to correct the impacts of this technological change, locally and on the Albufera wetland, located immediately downstream of the abovementioned irrigable area. The research is based on a documentary review and a participatory action research. The results show how the emerging concept of the rebound effect is permeating too slowly from academia to institutions and users, and that there is a need to stimulate innovative decision-making to achieve a more rigorous allocation of water and to adapt water and environmental planning. The research analyse a pioneering action which is the first sign of the materialisation of a change in the efficiency paradigm.",

    "abstract": "European dairy cattle production systems (DPS) are facing multiple challenges that threaten their social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this context, it is crucial to implement options to promote the reconnection between crop and livestock systems as a way to reduce emissions and enhance nutrient circularity. However, given the sector's diversity, the successful implementation of these options lacks an evaluation framework that jointly considers the climatic conditions, farm characteristics, manure management and mineral fertilisation practices of DPS across Europe. This study aims to develop a modelling and statistical framework to assess the effect of climatic conditions, farm characteristics, manure management and mineral fertilisation practices on the on-farm sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) losses from ten contrasting case studies for dairy production across Europe, identifying options for emissions mitigation and nutrient circularity. Using the SIMSDAIRY deterministic whole-farm modelling approach, we estimated the GHG emissions and N losses from the ten case studies. SIMSDAIRY captures the effect of different farm management choices and site-specific conditions on nutrient cycling and emissions from different components of a dairy farm. In addition, we applied the Factor Analysis for Mixed Data multivariate statistical approach to quantitative and qualitative variables and identified relationships among emissions, nutrient losses, and the particular characteristics of the case studies assessed. The results showed how intensive case study farms in temperate climates were associated with lower enteric emissions but higher emissions from manure management (e.g. housing). In contrast, semi-extensive case study farms in cooler climates exhibited higher N losses and GHG emissions, directly linked to increased mineral fertilisation, excreta during grazing, and slurry application using broadcast. Furthermore, the results indicated opportunities to improve nutrient circularity and crop-livestock integration by including high-quality forages instead of concentrates and substituting mineral fertilisers with organic fertilisers. The presented framework provides valuable insights for designing, implementing, and monitoring context-specific emission mitigation options and nutrient circularity practices. By combining whole-farm modelling approaches and multivariate statistical methods, we enhance the understanding of the interactions between sources of N losses and GHG emissions. We expect our findings to inform the adoption of emissions reduction and circularity practices by fostering the recoupling between crop and livestock systems.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture-driven land conversion poses a significant threat to global biodiversity conservation. Balancing agricultural expansion with conservation is a critical challenge for governments and development partners. Sustainability-oriented agriculture programs such as conservation agriculture and land intensification aim to reduce land conversion and deforestation; however, evidence of their effectiveness remains complex and elusive, especially regarding the role of smallholders. This study addresses this knowledge gap by systematically mapping the drivers of smallholder land conversion and their interconnections across three focal biodiverse contexts including sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia as well as from a global scale. Using literature that focuses on the nexus of smallholder farmers and agricultural intensification, this study systematically identified the potential of distinct factors and dynamic processes to serve as system leverage points toward improved outcomes for biodiversity, food security, and smallholder livelihoods, using a combination of structural factor analysis, centrality analysis, and feedback loop analysis. The results highlight the importance of strengthening land tenure systems, providing technical support to farmers, improving market access, and prioritizing smallholder livelihoods in mitigating land conversion. Contextual differences emphasize the need for context-specific interventions and further research to explore factors driving land conversion more deeply within specific contextual boundaries. Future studies should map proposed policy interventions onto local systems driving land conversion and incorporate the diverse perspectives of local stakeholders to guide effective and sustainable agriculture interventions.",

    "abstract": "Most of the nutrients in food supply chains are lost as waste and pollution at great environmental and economic cost. A more circular agricultural system can be developed through recycling of organic waste streams such as manure and food waste into organic fertilizers. This study assessed the agricultural system's circularity potential in the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB), the largest tributary to the Chesapeake Bay, by recycling organic waste streams such as manure and food waste into fertilizers. Using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we developed and deployed three different scenarios beyond the baseline of current practices. First, we created the Manure Transport scenario to study improved manure transport beyond the sub-watershed where it is produced. Second, we developed the High Nitrogen Recovery Manure scenario to evaluate an increase of available nitrogen (N) in manure assuming developing technologies could reduce N losses from storage and transportation, leaving more N to apply to cropland. The final Compost scenario used food-waste as a source for compost fertilizer applied to areas without manure available. We evaluated the level of circularity from each scenario through the spatial distribution and the proportion of cropland using organic fertilizers sourced from manure and compost generated in the SRB. Additionally, we considered water quality at the outlet of the SRB to determine the impact a circular agricultural system could have on the water quality goals set forth for Chesapeake Bay. The Manure Transport scenario showed circularity and water quality results similar to the baseline conditions. The High Nitrogen Recovery Manure scenario demonstrated the highest circularity, with 46% of cropland using organic fertilizers, resulting in the smallest phosphorus (P) loading per watershed area (3.26 kg/ha/yr) at the SRB outlet. However, it also had the highest N loading (9.97 kg/ha/yr) at the outlet. The Compost scenario doubled the area treated with organic fertilizers, with 16% of cropland utilizing compost application, and led to increased N (8.48 kg/ha/yr) and P (4.17 kg/ha/yr) loading at the SRB outlet. The study highlighted that cropland area in this region is sufficient to expand the use of manure and food waste compost as fertilizers, thereby enhancing circularity and reducing commercial fertilizer inputs. However, it emphasized the importance of integrating field management strategies to address agricultural runoff concerns and achieve both waste reduction and improved water quality.",

    "abstract": "The need for sustainable and resilient farming practices is clearly communicated by the scholars and the European Union policy strategies. The low interest in adopting the practice due to the uncertainties and the variability in the economic outcomes across various intercropping types calls for research attention. In this respect, research is needed to identifying specific intercropping practices that lead to improved farm-level economic outcomes and resilience. This study investigates consequences of intercropping adoption on the farm economic outcomes, in the context of achieving economic resilience. Specific objectives are to assess the effect of i) adopting intercropping on the economic outcomes; ii) production adjustments on the economic resilience of the intercropping practices, both in comparison to conventional mono-cropped agriculture. The analysis is conducted by using a stochastic partial budgeting model. We use Swedish agriculture as an empirical basis for our study and model two baseline cereal monocropping scenarios and two corresponding alternative (strip and mixed) cereal-legume intercropping scenarios. This is to examine net changes and risk characteristics resulting from the adaptation from monocropping to intercropping production practices. Estimates of net changes and the respective risk characteristics are integrated in an economic resilience assessment for the intercropping practices. Results reveal that the net economic benefit change from adopting differs across the intercropping alternatives. Prices of the monocropped and the intercropped products of both intercropping alternatives and the use of N fertilizer for the strip intercropping alternative are the most influential factors in determining the adaptability capacity. This study provides a novel approach that contributes to the literature via quantifying economic resilience capacities of hypothetical technology adoption. The paper presents unique results on the economic resilience of adopting cereal-legume intercropping practices in a Nordic context, giving agriculture in Nordic regions shares common challenges such as short growing season and cold temperature. The results offer valuable insights for extension services in guiding farmers to choose appropriate intercropping practices based on the production possibilities and market needs. Policy implications targeting the adoption of cereal-legume intercropping adoption are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The development of new advanced technologies has led to rapid changes livestock production systems. Precision livestock farming (PLF) uses digital devices that gather, process and examine specific physiological, behavioral and production indicators to improve control of individual animals. Regarding dairy farming, despite the wide scientific debate, the digital devices (i.e., pedometers) are not widely used among farmers, and as such, market data are unavailable to study farmer demand for the technology. In literature, the exact causes that favor or discourage the adoption of digital devices have not yet been identified. The aim of the work was to estimate dairy farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for an innovative prototype of pedometer that does not need IT infrastructure to work but can operate autonomously, related to factors not yet investigated, and in particular the \"payment method\", \"type of data provided\" by the device, the \"convenience of use\" and the \"price\". We conducted a choice experiment (stated preference method) to determine dairy farmers demand for pedometers and their willingness-to-pay. Farmers are likely to purchase the pedometer under certain conditions and with specific functions: through a monthly subscription associated with the technical support service; for a trial period and possibly returning it at the end of the period; reading data provided by the pedometer through their smartphones; having information related to estrus prediction rather than other related to animal welfare. The results provide a useful contribution to understand the influencing factors of the underutilization of digital devices by dairy farmers. The issue of digital device adoption has become crucial for increasing the competitiveness of dairy farms especially in the current historical period when issues of sustainability and digitization have become of great importance. New solutions or strategies need to be thought of that enable the use of such devices that are technically easy to use and economically more affordable for farmers.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and energy security concerns have driven the development of policies that encourage bioenergy production. Meeting EU targets for the consumption of transport fuels from bioenergy by 2020 will require a large increase in the production of bioenergy feedstock. Initially an increase in 'first generation' biofuels was observed, however 'food competition' concerns have generated interest in second generation biofuels (SGBs). These SGBs can be produced from co-products (e.g. cereal straw) or energy crops (e.g. miscanthus), with the former largely negating food competition concerns. In order to assess the sustainability of feedstock supply for SGBs, the financial, environmental and energy costs and benefits of the farm system must be quantified. Previous research has captured financial costs and benefits through linear programming (LP) approaches, whilst environmental and energy metrics have been largely been undertaken within life cycle analysis (LCA) frameworks. Assessing aspects of the financial, environmental and energy sustainability of supplying co-product second generation biofuel (CPSGB) feedstocks at the farm level requires a framework that permits the trade-offs between these objectives to be quantified and understood. The development of a modelling framework for Managing Energy and Emissions Trade-Offs in Agriculture (MEETA Model) that combines bio-economic process modelling and LCA is presented together with input data parameters obtained from literature and industry sources. The MEETA model quantifies arable farm inputs and outputs in terms of financial, energy and emissions results. The model explicitly captures fertiliser: crop-yield relationships, plus the incorporation of straw or removal for sale, with associated nutrient impacts of incorporation/removal on the following crop in the rotation. Key results of crop-mix, machinery use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kg of crop product and energy use per hectare are in line with previous research and industry survey findings. Results show that the gross margin - energy trade-off is £36 GJ-1, representing the gross margin forgone by maximising net farm energy cf. maximising farm gross margin. The gross margin-GHG emission trade-off is £0.15 kg-1 CO2 eq, representing the gross margin forgone per kg of CO2 eq reduced when GHG emissions are minimised cf. maximising farm gross margin. The energy-GHG emission trade-off is 0.03 GJ kg-1 CO2 eq quantifying the reduction in net energy from the farm system per kg of CO2 eq reduced when minimising GHG emissions cf. maximising net farm energy. When both farm gross margin and net farm energy are maximised all the cereal straw is baled for sale. Sensitivity analysis of the model in relation to different prices of cereal straw shows that it becomes financially optimal to incorporate wheat straw at price of £11 t-1 for this co-product. Local market conditions for straw and farmer attitudes towards incorporation or sale of straw will impact on the straw price at which farmers will supply this potential bioenergy feedstock and represent important areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "There is renewed interest in expanded agricultural development in northern Australia supported by increasing global demand for food, the region's proximity to Asian markets, and the current government policy initiatives to support economically sustainable and vibrant rural and regional communities. The production potential, financial returns, and the supply chain implications for irrigated agriculture were assessed in four different regions across northern Australia to provide a systems analysis of development opportunities and challenges. Gross margins for high volume, low value broadacre crops were mostly either negative or weakly positive, principally due to high transport costs to established markets in southern and eastern Australia. The returns were largely positive for higher value horticultural and specialist niche crops or industrial crops with local processing facilities. Scenarios incorporating alternative transport routes to Asia provided modest cost savings, but required assumptions for suitable shipping routes and cost-effective availability of containers, but did not significantly boost gross margins. When scaled to whole irrigation areas, the regional gross value of production could be significant but improving returns at farm scale requires more cost-effective supply chains. The ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investment was strongly influenced by the sequence of years associated with climatic variability and/or other unexpected shocks experienced in the years immediately following investment. The analysis highlighted that each component of the system – climate, soils, water, agronomic practice, pests and diseases, farm operations, management, planning, supply chains, infrastructure, labour, services, markets – needs to be understood but ultimate success will depend on managing the complexity of the whole farming system and value-chain. Further, scaling up development at a considered pace and being prepared for considerable lags before positive returns on investment are achieved will be critical for successful long-term irrigated agricultural ventures in northern Australia.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable intensification of agricultural production systems will require changes in farm practice. Within arable cropping systems, reducing the intensity of tillage practices (e.g. reduced tillage) potentially offers one such sustainable intensification approach. Previous researchers have tended to examine the impact of reduced tillage on specific factors such as yield or weed burden, whilst, by definition, sustainable intensification necessitates a system-based analysis approach. Drawing upon a bio-economic optimisation model, 'MEETA', we quantify trade-off implications between potential yield reductions, reduced cultivation costs and increased crop protection costs. We extend the MEETA model to quantify farm-level net margin, in addition to quantifying farm-level gross margin, net energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. For the lowest intensity tillage system, zero tillage, results demonstrate financial benefits over a conventional tillage system even when the zero tillage system includes yield penalties of 0-14.2% (across all crops). Average yield reductions from zero tillage literature range from 0 to 8.5%, demonstrating that reduced tillage offers a realistic and attainable sustainable intensification intervention, given the financial and environmental benefits, albeit that yield reductions will require more land to compensate for loss of calories produced, negating environmental benefits observed at farm-level. However, increasing uptake of reduced tillage from current levels will probably require policy intervention; an extension of the recent changes to the CAP ('Greening') provides an opportunity to do this.",

    "abstract": "Improving farming systems in resource-poor contexts is often difficult as farmers face multiple challenges to implement the innovations developed by researchers. Viable solutions may however be present within local communities by positive deviant farmers, i.e. farmers that outperform positively compared to others. This study develops a positive deviance informed methodology to support redesign of farming systems, with the aim to improve farm productive, economic and environmental performances. We tested the methodology in Bihar, India, using survey data from 43 farms and the indicators of operating profit, soil organic matter balance, water use and dietary energy production. Positive deviant farms and practices were first identified and then recombined into a redesigned farm in consultation with farmers. The FarmDESIGN model was used to calculate current farm performance and to explore potential alternative farm configurations in the redesign. We found that outstanding performance on all indicators could only be reached by integrating high livestock density with an optimal combination of crop practices, which confirms the key role of interactions among components in mixed crop-livestock systems to improve all dimensions of farm sustainability. The redesigns outperformed all real farms on the indicators assessed. Farmers confirmed the viability of the redesigns in focus group discussions and their suggestions can serve as useful input for a next cycle of farm redesign. Since all suggestions are locally practiced and have proven to be accessible, affordable and recognizable, we conclude that our methodology based on positive deviant farms and practices yields promising results with a large potential to boost agricultural development for resource-scarce smallholder farmers.",

    "abstract": "This study contrasts the short-term effects of the quarantine measures implemented to contain the COVID-19 disease on the production and commercialization strategies of potato and coffee producers in Peru. Potato farmers appeared more impacted by the shock due to disruptions in the commercialization channels, leading to lower sales volumes and prices. In the near future, both potato and coffee farmers risk severe capital losses that are likely to affect the next agricultural season. Changes in household consumption patterns and intentions to introduce new crops to improve food security were reported, along with some concerns about long-term effects on the health and nutritional status of the households.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of food security with agricultural systems models often focus on indicators of food availability, with limited treatment of the other three dimensions: food access, stability and utilization. We illustrate how three indicators of access (food consumption expenditures, a food insecurity scale and dietary diversity) and their stability can be incorporated into a dynamic household-level model of a maize-based production system in the Kenya highlands and a dynamic regional model of sheep production and marketing in Mexico. Although stylized due to limits on empirical evidence, the analyses suggest that inclusion of multiple access indicators can provide insights because the indicators respond differently to production shocks, demand growth and programs providing production subsidies. We also illustrate how to examine stability of food security outcomes in response to shocks using metrics of hardness (ability to withstand shocks) and elasticity (ability to return to previous conditions). The data required for more widespread empirical implementation of these methods include measurement—preferably at frequent intervals over time—of food access indicators, but also their determinants and linkages to outcomes in agricultural systems models. Analyses of food access and stability will be most valuable for assessments of food security impacts of climate change, when food systems are undergoing transformative change and to identify priority interventions and target audiences.",

That is, how experimentation with an IP approach in one context leads to it being succesfully replicated in other contexts. To inspire development actors to consider the fit of an innovation methodology for a context, following work on anchoring for scaling, we developed a framework for networking-, methodological, and institutional anchoring and applied it to a R4D IP in order to test the value of such an anchoring approach for understanding the scaling of innovation methodologies such as IP. We selected a R4D project with a Farmer Research Group-Innovation Platform in Ethiopia, whose technical output and methodological approach were greatly appreciated by the actors involved. Using the anchoring framework, the executed or non-executed tasks were identified. Besides, the embedding of the methodological experiment the potential up-scaling and out-scaling were systematically analyzed. The analysis yielded the strengths and weaknesses of the anchoring work done so far to scale the innovation methodology used, and provided concrete suggestions of how to proceed if an innovation project considers 'going to scale'. We recommend R4D projects to valorize their work and pay more explicit attention to anchoring. With a flexible, multi-pronged anchoring approach and continuous scanning of the progress made in context, more R4D projects and their associated innovation methodologies can 'go to scale'.",

We evaluate these farmers' vulnerability and assess the potential of using increased crop diversity to improve their resilience. We further explore trade-offs and synergies between environmental, economic and nutritional outcomes faced by the farmers in their decision making when a regime shift occurs. We simulate the large-scale scenarios with the IMPACT model and use the results obtained to assess their effect at the local level using the bio-economic farm-household model, FarmDESIGN. Our results indicate that climate change can lead to a regime shift that expands revenue variance, increases soil erosion and reduces vitamin A yield for farmers. Banana disease can negatively impact income levels and species diversity. We show that under both scenarios farmers have scope to reconfigure their farms and recover farm performance. Specifically, we discuss the benefits of species diversity; increasing agrobiodiversity by adding new crops increases the farm's adaptive capacity and resilience, allowing for much higher revenues, on-farm crop diversity and vitamin A production. The conceptual approach and the method we developed can be applied to assess the local synergies and trade-offs between crop diversity conservation, nutrition, environmental protection and human nutrition that farmers face as a result of global drivers. Our results offer a further understanding of how biodiverse systems respond to regime shifts, which can inform effective policy design. Our method can be also useful to help farmers manage their farms in a way to better meet their complex needs.",

    "abstract": "Demand for grass-based dairy production, which relies heavily on grazing and use of forage crops, is growing in the United States, primarily due to reported human health benefits of the milk produced as well as perceived environmental and animal welfare benefits. We used a whole-farm model to evaluate environmental footprints of all-grass, grass supplemented with grain, and confinement dairy production systems in the temperate climate of the northeastern U.S. Model results were depicted per unit of farmland and per unit of milk produced to provide alternate perspectives from the viewpoint of land management and commodity production. For most environmental indicators, the grass-based systems had smaller environmental impacts per unit of farmland but larger impacts per unit of milk produced compared to confinement fed systems. To verify the simulation of grass-based operations, eight dairy farms - ranging from herds that were grazed and fed only forage to herds that received some grain supplementation - were surveyed and modeled. Due to variation in climate, soil characteristics and management practices, a comparison of the two grass-based farm types showed no significant differences in environmental impacts. Farms of the same size using each production strategy along with a more traditional confinement production system were then simulated using the same climate and soil conditions for a better comparison. Predicted nitrogen and phosphorus losses to the environment, fossil energy use, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions were less from the grass-based farms compared to the confinement operation. Due to lower milk production on the grass-based dairies, nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions expressed per unit of milk produced were generally greater than those of the confinement system. Within the grass-based dairy systems, the system that supplemented with grain had slightly lower nitrogen and phosphorus losses per unit of farmland compared to the grass-only system, and much lower losses and emissions when expressed per unit of milk produced. Total production cost was less for the all-grass dairy than the grass with grain dairy. With a greater milk price, the all-grass system provided greater profitability per unit of land used and per unit of milk produced compared to the confinement farm of similar size. These data indicate that grass-based dairy farms can provide environmental benefits to a local watershed, but due to a lower efficiency in milk production, they may increase the aggregate environmental impacts of regional and global supply chains.",

    "abstract": "Past reviews of policy impact assessment studies using bio-economic farm models (BEFM) called for the development of a generic and modular implementation that can be maintained by a network of modellers. A main reason for these calls is the project-oriented way in which model developers receive funding. It favours the development of new models with case-study specific features over the maintenance and extension of well-tested, more generic ones which allow comparing results in a consistent way across many case-studies. The demand for more generic tools also reflects the dynamic landscape of policy measures within larger policy frameworks like the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). These policy frameworks move increasingly away from a 'one-size-fits-all' approach of policy design towards more flexible systems, giving greater freedom to shape, implement, and target policy measures to specific regions, farm management systems and farm types. This creates new challenges for model-based impact assessment as applied models have to reflect the variety of policy measures and characteristics of targeted farmers and rural communities. The aim of this paper is to first address key questions regarding the functionality and implementation of such a modular BEFM that can be maintained and expanded by a user group, and second to develop concrete proposals of necessary model features, model design and shared development. This paper builds on literature research, including a detailed review of four models that are used extensively for impact assessment within the EU and were developed by multiple teams over a longer period of time. From there, necessary and desirable features of a generic and modular BEFM are identified and requirements for model design regarding modularity, software engineering, and shared development are discussed. This feeds into the development of concrete proposals of how modularity and flexibility can be addressed in the development, application and maintenance of a BEFM. At the end, a list of design decisions and implementation steps is proposed to build a modular BEFM that can be maintained by a network of researchers. The concept for a network-based generic and modular bio-economic farm model responds to the demand for analytical tools in agricultural policy impact analysis. The paper develops a research agenda to overcome observed limitations in the current landscape of such models.",

    "abstract": "Food systems face multiple challenges simultaneously: provision to a growing population, adaptation to more extreme and frequent climate change risks, and reduction of their considerable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Food system interventions and policies give rise to synergies and trade-offs that emerge over time due to the dynamic nature and interconnections of system elements. Analysis of an entire food system is necessary to identify synergies that bring simultaneous benefits and mitigate trade-offs, both short- and long-term. Our study aims to inform the sustainable transformation of food systems by identifying short- and long-term synergies and trade-offs in the climate-smart village (CSV) Lawra-Jirapa in northern Ghana under the current practices, technologies, policies, and trends of population growth, extreme events, and climate change impacts. We develop a system dynamics model to simulate the food system in the CSV between 2011 and 2060. We apply the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approach as a diagnostic tool to the CSV system to reveal the short- and long-term trade-offs and synergies between the CSA goals. The simulation results reveal short-term progress towards the goal of increased productivity and income, with trade-offs in the goals of GHG removal, climate adaptation, and resilience. In the long term, post-2035, current agriculture practices, technologies, and policies inside and outside the CSV boundaries result in trade-offs across all three CSA goals, and progress made towards these goals is reversed. The CSV system behaviour, thus, exhibits a \"better before worse\" pattern. The analysis demonstrates an approach, which considers simultaneously all three CSA goals, to identify synergies and mitigate trade-offs in an entire food system. The findings suggest that understanding the dynamics of food systems is a precursor to their sustainable transformation. This transformation will entail changes to the food system's goals and structure with equal attention to short- and long-term outcomes.",

Northern cropping systems may benefit from longer and warmer growing seasons, but the sustainability of production will be challenged due to increased production risks. Concentrated efforts are needed to find ways to adapt cropping to changing conditions and sustainably intensify production. This study combined stakeholder knowledge and simulation modelling to find means for the sustainable intensification of cereal production in the North Savo region in Finland. Stakeholders identified promising intensification measures in two workshops. Alternative options for sustainable intensification and climate adaptations and their combinations were assessed using the APSIM cropping system model. The model was used to assess cereal yields, the grain nitrogen (N) content, nitrate leaching and water productivity for a historical baseline (1981–2010) and mid-century conditions (2041–2070) projected by five general circulation models for different emission scenarios. Simulated management options included improved cultivars with later maturing characteristics, improved heat/drought resistance and nitrogen-use efficiency, increased N fertilisation levels, improved crop rotations together with improved soil, as well as supplementary and full irrigation. The simulation results indicated that although a warming climate in conjunction with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations generally increase yield levels, N uptake and water productivity, risks associated with higher N leaching due to increased precipitation are a challenge for the sustainability of crop production. Overall, different SI options affected the sustainability indicators studied more than future projected climate, strongly suggesting that there is a large potential for sustainably intensifying crop production in northern conditions, particularly when applying more than one intensification measure at a time. Among a wide set of SI options tested for their sustainability impacts, improved crop cultivars showed the firmest positive impacts. This was supported by the views of agricultural stakeholders in the region. While the agricultural stakeholder's suggestions for alternative SI options challenged the simulation approach to some extent, the simulations provided robust information for comparing the sustainability impacts of alternative measures.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture in Western Europe is predominantly input-intensive (fertilisers, water, fuel, pesticides) and relies on feed imports. As a result, it is dependent on oil, which may start to decline in production in the 2020s, thus exposing the agricultural sector to potential economic stress, including increased input prices and decreased farmer purchase capacities. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the capacity of European farming systems (FS) to maintain production levels despite a decline in oil production (i.e., robustness). We aimed to model and compare the time variations in the animal- and crop-sourced production of three French FS under three scenarios of decreased availability of feed and synthetic fertiliser imports. We developed a FS-scale dynamic model that considers nitrogen flows between livestock, plant, and soil compartments. Plant production is a function of soil mineral nitrogen levels, and livestock numbers depend on feed availability. The three FS are characterised by different crop-grassland-livestock balances: (i) field crop (Plateau Picard), (ii) intensive monogastric (Bretagne Centrale), and (iii) extensive ruminant (Bocage Bourbonnais). The three scenarios consist of different combinations of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers and feed import availability declines until 2050: a decrease in synthetic fertilisers only (Synth-), a decrease in feed imports (Feed-), and a decrease in both external inputs (Synth-Feed-). The first two scenarios highlight the positive role of livestock effluents and permanent grasslands on the robustness of food production. In the Synth-Feed- scenario, the extensive ruminant FS exhibits robustness (no decline in food production) for 13 years, whereas the field crop FS exhibits robustness for 4 years. In contrast, the intensive monogastric FS shows decreased food production within the first year. The difference between the two crop-livestock FS can be explained by livestock density, herd composition but also plant cover composition. In the long term, all three FS show a decrease in food production between 45 and 60%. Our modelling work shed some light on the role of ruminants and permanent grasslands in making FS more robust to decreases in synthetic fertiliser and feed import availability, increasing the time without production decline after the beginning of the perturbation. For longer-time resilience, configurational changes are still necessary, however a greater robustness gives more time to implement them, therefore facilitating adaptation and transformation. Our model paves the way to the study of resilience of FS from the point of view of their crop-grassland-livestock configuration and their dependence on external inputs.",

    "abstract": "The nutritive value of annual pasture legumes changes with phenology during each season, with a progressive decrease in feeding value as plants accumulate structural carbohydrates and nutrients are diluted. However, these changes differ widely among annual legume species, affecting the pattern of nutrient availability and production in a grazing enterprise. This paper set out to examine the implications of differences in the nutritive value of annual pasture legumes in relation to their economic value for mixed farming systems of southern Australia. Calibrated GrassGro™ plant models with data generated from field experiments to represent Dry Matter Digestibility (DMD) profiles of six annual legume species; Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic), B. pelecinus L. (biserrula), Trifolium spumosum L. (bladder clover), Ornithopus sativus Brot. (French serradella), Medicago littoralis Rhode ex Loisel. (strand medic) and Trifolium subterraneum L. (subterranean clover). The plant models were used in a modelling study to support a self-replacing Merino sheep enterprise, which was simulated at seven locations across southern Australia, where annual pasture species are heavily relied on for livestock production. Modelled values of DMD of green material, averaged across all phenological stages, ranged from approximately 62% (French serradella) to 73% (bladder clover), with little variation due to location. Pastures with higher nutritive value had a reduced requirement for supplementary feeding of sheep. Variation in nutritive value had a greater effect on supplementary feeding costs and gross margins than differences in biomass production among the annual legume species. Differences in the levels of supplementary feeding required in systems with the different legumes was most pronounced during the period from May to July (late autumn to winter). For sheep enterprises compared at the same stocking rate, the total supplementary feed required was 18% lower with bladder clover pastures, and 9% lower in subterranean clover pastures, compared with an average of the remaining four pasture species. This is the first study to compare the effects of variation in nutritive value among the annual pasture legumes developed for the soils and climatic conditions of southern Australia. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude of differences in nutritive value among annual pasture legumes are economically important and that the establishment of higher nutritive value legumes will reduce supplementary feeding costs in extensive grazing systems, in some cases even where their biomass production is lower.",

    "abstract": "Agri-food systems face complex sustainability challenges, containing conflicting interests, goals, worldviews and fragmented knowledge and decision-making. There is a need for a better understanding of how to turn knowledge about sustainability into actions for change. The complexity of these challenges necessitates systemic, cross-sectorial, and multi-actor processes. The aim of this study was to strengthen agri-food systems associated with organic vegetables in the Vestfold region in Norway by involving actors through a living lab and to generate knowledge regarding the establishment phase of cross-cutting change initiatives. This included exploring how actors from within and beyond the agri-food domain could be selected and recruited and investigating what characterize their perceived understanding of the current situation regarding organic vegetables and their shared vision. We first drew the boundary of the living lab “system” in relation to improving the situation of organic vegetable agri-food systems. We explored potential participants by developing and applying a procedure for discovering sectors and actors that could contribute to overcome development obstacles. We then used the snowball sampling method and interviewed 48 actors, identifying 80 potential participants. Among these, 30 actors participated in a workshop in which we facilitated co-creative processes for creating a common problem understanding and a shared vision. The procedure helped identify change-oriented actors within the agri-food domain. Actors represented small-scale entities who had power to influence their own business, as well as individuals within large-scale entities with limited power to influence change in own organizations. We also discovered actors beyond the agri-food domain who did not originally identify themselves closely with the topic of organic food, such as actors from waste management, education, regional, business, and tourism development, and health and welfare. The diversity of actors contributed to a rich and holistic perspective on the current situation for agriculture and food. They co-created a manifold, but coherent, shared vision, portraying a more collaborative orientation in localized agri-food systems. The gaps between current and future desired situations clearly served as a starting point for action planning and testing. The study shows crucial steps in establishing an agri-food living lab, including introductory work of bounding the system, selecting actors, and conducting co-creative processes. The study developed and applied a procedure for discovering actors within and beyond the agri-food domain who could contribute to overcoming development obstacles. This procedure can be adjusted and utilized in other settings.",

Climate change is expected to change these conditions, challenging interpretation of LTE data with regard to the distinction between climate change and management effects. The objective of the study was to quantify the expected, spatially differentiated changes of agroclimatic conditions for the German LTE sites as a precondition for modelling and LTE data interpretation. We developed a framework combining spatially distributed climate data and LTE metadata to identify the possible climatic changes at 247 LTE sites with experiments running for 20 years or more. The LTEs were classified using the following categories: fertilization, tillage, crop rotation, field crops or grassland, conventional or organic. We utilized climate variables (temperature, precipitation) and agroclimatic indicators (aridity, growing degree days, etc.) to compare a baseline (1971–2000) with future periods (2021−2100) under the IPCC's Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP). A comprehensive LTE risk assessment was conducted, based on changes in climate variables and agroclimatic indicators between baseline and future scenarios. Under the most extreme scenario (SSP585), 150 LTEs are expected to shift from humid and dry sub-humid to semi-arid conditions. Frost days in LTE areas are expected to decline by 81%, and the growing season to lengthen by up to 92%. The spatial differentiation of expected climate change also facilitates the identification of suitable sites for future agricultural practices and may inform the design of new LTEs. Our results may guide the interpretation of LTE data regarding the effect of climate change, facilitating future soil crop modelling studies with LTE data and providing information for planning new LTE sites to support future agricultural research and/or adapting management on existing LTE sites. The framework we developed can easily be transferred to LTE sites in agricultural regions worldwide to support LTE research on climate change impacts and adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative agriculture is a farming approach that uses soil health as the entry point to contribute to multiple objectives, such as improved nutrient cycling and climate regulation. To reach these objectives farmers can apply different practices. The objectives and practices, however, are not equally relevant or applicable for every farming system and local context. The main objective of this paper, therefore, was to find out how tailor-made solutions towards regenerative agriculture can be identified and evaluated as such that they result in meaning-full advice for farmers. In this study a well-established modelling framework to redesign farming systems was applied to three typical but diverse Dutch farming systems. The modelling framework combined the models Soil Navigator and FarmDESIGN to simultaneously assess five soil functions at field-level and general sustainability indicators (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) at farm-level. We applied the modelling framework to an arable farm on clay soil, a dairy farm on peat soil, and a mixed farm on sand soil. We subsequently explored a multitude of tailor-made solutions composed of combinations of practices for these farming systems, each showing solutions that contributed in varying degrees towards the objectives of regenerative agriculture. In total, we created 4000 alternative solutions per case-study farm. For all farming systems, environmental performance was improved in the solutions dominated by the use of regenerative practices. For example, for the arable, the dairy, and the mixed case-study farm, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 50% (from 4 to 2 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1), 6% (from 30 to 28 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1), and 23% (from 21 to 16 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1), respectively, while maintaining soil functionality at high capacity for four out of the five soil functions. This overall improvement in environmental performance due to the application of regenerative practices, also resulted in reduced farm profitability for all case-study farms by on average 50%. We discuss that a mechanism to incentivize farmers for their tailor-made contribution to regenerative agriculture is for stakeholders to shift focus from solely primary productivity to also other ecosystem services. This study contributes to the wider implementation of regenerative agriculture, by showing which regenerative objectives and farming practices can contribute to the transition towards regenerative agriculture in contrasting contexts. The modelling framework that is used, can underpin regenerative management for farmers and other stakeholders to help, for example, the valorization of multiple regenerative objectives in business models.",

    "abstract": "The concept of responsible innovation is gaining traction in the Smart Farming field to address emerging socio-ethical issues such as power asymmetries between farmers and technology development companies in farm data ownership, and animal welfare issues arising from the automation of livestock management. Responsible innovation involves the democratisation of science and decision making for societal control of innovations. The application of responsible innovation principles to the adoption phase of Smart Farming technologies is an under explored area in terms of defining what responsible adoption practices are for Smart Farming, and with what effect. This empirical research aims to provide insights into what responsible adoption practices might involve, based on application of a responsible innovation approach to designing a cross-industry adoption strategy for a virtual fencing technology in Australia. This case study also examines what responsible adoption practices mean for enacting responsible innovation of Smart Farming technologies more broadly. A participatory Technology Assessment (pTA) approach engaged a range of virtual fencing technology end-users (livestock producers) and stakeholders (agricultural advisers, natural resource managers, food retailers, a food processor, and state government department staff) (n = 80). The participants identified and considered the benefits and risks of implementing a specific virtual fencing product in various contexts. The engagement methods were 12 interactive workshops organized in peer/sector groups and one reflective and deliberative consultation process with 13 adoption specialists and practitioners to define an adoption pathway for virtual herding technology. The adoption of the virtual herding technology product requires multiple levels of support to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and generates private, industry and public goods. This prospective knowledge, built from the considerations of end-users and stakeholders, was integrated into a virtual herding adoption strategy, and accounted for animal welfare concerns, the empowerment of producers to lead their own adoption support network and the desire for some form of regulatory governance. The responsible adoption practices were limited by the lack of institutional pathways to mobilise the strategy beyond the life of the research project. The research indicates that there is value in further pursuing the notion of responsible adoption practices for Smart Farming technologies. These practices need to be designed for understanding the complexity of the adoption situation, testing the assumptions about what the 'right' adoption pathway should be, and inclusive participation in the ongoing governance of adoption pathways.",

    "abstract": "Coffee agroforestry systems (shaded coffee) are considered less productive but more resilient than more intensive production systems. A persistent challenge for coffee farmers is the extreme fluctuations in coffee prices, leading to a loss of profitability and lower investment in production. There are contrasting conclusions regarding the profitability trade-off between increasing productivity through intensification and the sustainability benefits of shade tree coffee agroforestry systems. Using a typology of different intensification and sustainability coffee production strategies in Costa Rica and Guatemala, we assess the economic feasibility and sensitivity of those strategies under likely future scenarios of price and cost variability. Based on on-farm survey data from a large-scale survey of farmers with information on costs, prices and yields over ten years, a probabilistic cash flow analysis was used to create a stochastic model for net returns. Under future price scenarios, the Net Present Value (NPV) for coffee production was greatest for the high-productivity farms with high investment and moderate shade levels. The NPV of low-investment farms was greater (and positive) for highly shaded coffee production than for low shade coffee production (which, on average, had a negative NPV), despite the two having similar levels of investment. Diversification with bananas or avocados in association with coffee only improved NPV for high-value export avocado. Despite the substantially higher production costs for the high productivity systems, they generally maintained higher probabilities of achieving a positive net cash income or achieving a living income under most labour, fertilizer or coffee price scenarios, except a 50% fall in coffee prices. Diversification effects were as sensitive to changes in labour and input costs but in most cases reduced the probability of a more pronounced negative net cash income under low coffee price scenarios. We find an increase in coffee prices by 50% was needed to enable all farmers to achieve a positive net cash income; with an increased probability of achieving returns comparable with a living wage for higher productivity systems. We conclude that high-investment, high-productivity coffee production systems are compatible with shade-grown production; more likely to lead to economic success and achieve positive returns under most conditions, except large falls in coffee prices. For farmers with limited capacity to invest, high-shade production systems provide a positive cash return under a broader range of price conditions than low-shade systems.",

    "abstract": "India's agricultural systems are increasingly affected by climate change's adverse effects. The Government of India has an impressive set of programs to address this issue, but they have substantial shortcomings, especially in reaching women farmers. We aim to understand policy and implementation gaps in reaching women farmers with climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and study how women and men farmer's different roles in agriculture shape their needs and access to complementary services needed to adapt to climate change. An extensive review of India's agriculture and climate policies and program and a series of focus group discussions with farmers in Gujarat, India to discuss constraints and potential entry points for better reaching women farmers with CSA practices. Women's increased vulnerability to climate change and reduced access to CSA practices can be attributed to limited land ownership, poor access to credit, reduced access to information and formal extension, and multiple pressures on their time. Village cooperatives and self-help groups can be leveraged to support women's access to agricultural information and adoption of CSA practices. This paper highlights constraints to information and extension access by Indian women farmers that could impede the widespread adoption of CSA practices. It fills an important knowledge gap in designing gender-responsive policies and inclusive agricultural extension systems to promote adoption of CSA practices among smallholder farmers.",

    "abstract": "Oil palm smallholders often have difficulty implementing good agricultural practices and replanting, and tend to obtain low yields compared to corporate plantations. A frequent strategy to improve the sustainability of smallholder production systems is sustainable intensification, aimed at increasing land productivity and farmers' incomes. To facilitate sustainable intensification, many leading public and private sustainability initiatives require farmers to join farmer organisations as a precondition for certification and assistance, with the objective of achieving advantages of scale. The objective of this article is to analyse the resilience of farmer organisations in the Ophir plantation when faced with replanting. We do so by linking actors, situations, and contexts relevant to collective action in five farmer cooperatives in Ophir over a 40-year period. Our aim is to offer unique insights into the enduring dynamics that influence the resilience of farmer organisations, shed light on smallholder oil palm replanting strategies, and draw several key lessons from this case. Our findings are based on field visits by the lead author before, during and after replanting. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to enable a holistic overview. During visits, 110 interviews with relevant stakeholders were recorded, project reports were collected, as were data on yields, costs, and other information on the functioning of the farming system. Analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery of the Ophir plantation and plantation inspections allowed us to further quantify replanting methods and replanting progress. A combined IAD-SES-NAS framework was used to structure findings and link variables, key events and context. Our results show that farmer organisations can facilitate sustainable intensification in smallholder systems, but the resilience of farmer organisations proved diverse during replanting. Thus, farmer organisations are by no means a silver bullet for sustainable intensification. Landscape conditions, palm tree age, smallholder diversity and financial (mis)management play crucial roles in the resilience of farmer organisations and replanting strategies. Significant investment in various types of collective action is needed to encourage sustainable intensification through farmer organisations. This article reports a rare holistic analysis of the bio-physical, socio-economic, and institutional aspects impacting collective action and replating in smallholder oil palm plantations. We present significant empirical data, which allows us to link 40 years of interactions between farmers, their institutions, plantations and changing contexts. Thereby we provide unique insights into farmer organisations, collective action and smallholder oil palm replanting.",

    "abstract": "The agri-food and rural development sector in Europe is undergoing digitalization, and therefore becoming increasingly data-dependent. However, limited experience in implementing Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles has restricted knowledge sharing and reusability. This study aims to investigate the existing FAIR Data Management practices in the agri-food and rural development sector by assessing the FAIRness of project outputs from recent H2020-funded Multi-Actor Projects (MAPs). We conducted a FAIRness assessment of project outputs using both semi-automatic and manual framework, and we also carried out a comprehensive review of the data sharing practices among selected MAPs. Of the investigated MAPs, <10% have achieved FAIR compliance and applied FAIR data management practices. The measured FAIRness of project products, including journal articles, conference papers, and books, is higher than that of other product types such as videos, audios, and presentations. The study highlights the critical need for standardizing the adoption of FAIR data principles and data management practices across both the agri-food and rural development sector but also across bureaucratic data management throughout Europe more widely. Such a change would facilitate broader utilization and re-use of MAPs outputs and results, enhancing decision-making and agri-food and rural development practices.",

    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics influence the climate impact of crop cultivation, both through affecting net carbon exchange between the soil and the atmosphere and through affecting soil fertility. Higher soil fertility can enhance yield, and consequently make more plant residues available for carbon sequestration in the soil. This feedback mechanism between SOC and yield is commonly not included when assessing the environmental impact of crop production using system analysis tools like life cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, this study developed a modelling framework where the SOC-yield feedback mechanism is included in climate impact assessment of crop cultivation, and which could be applied in LCAs. The framework was constructed by combining a model for SOC dynamics, yield response to SOC changes in a Swedish long-term field experiment and climate impact assessment. The framework employs a dynamic approach, with a time-distributed emissions inventory and a time-dependent climate impact assessment model, complemented by the most common climate metric, global warming potential (GWP). A case study applying the framework to barley cultivation was performed to explore the quantitative effect of including the feedback mechanism on the calculated climate impact. The case study involved simulating a fertiliser-induced 10% yield increase during one year and assessing the climate impact over 60 years. In this specific case, the effect of solely including SOC dynamics without the yield response to SOC decreased climate impact per kg barley by about three-fold more than only accounting for the 10% temporary yield increase. When the feedback mechanism was included, the estimated climate impact decreased five-fold more than when SOC changes were not included. These results show that SOC changes can affect the climate impact of cultivation, not only through affecting net CO2 exchanges between soil and atmosphere, as previously acknowledged by other studies, but also through changing the system performance. The quantitative results obtained in this study show that this could be an important aspect to include in order to avoid introducing systematic error when assessing the long-term climate impact of crop management changes that affect yield or SOC dynamics.",

    "abstract": "A whole-farm model, HolosNorBeef was developed to estimate net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from suckler beef production systems in Norway. The model considers direct emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from on-farm livestock production including soil carbon (C) changes, and indirect N2O and CO2 emissions associated with leaching, volatilization and inputs used on the farm. The emission intensities from average beef cattle farms in Norway was estimated by considering typical herds of British and Continental breeds located in two different regions, flatlands and mountains, with different resources and quality of feed available. The flatlands was located at a low altitude in an area suitable for grain production and mountains was located at higher altitude in a mountainous area not suitable for grain production. The estimated emission intensities were 29.5 and 32.0 kg CO2 equivalents (eq) kg‐1 carcass for the British breeds and 27.5 and 29.6 kg CO2 eq kg‐1 carcass for the Continental breeds, for flatlands and mountains, respectively. Enteric CH4 was the largest source accounting for 44–48% of total GHG emissions. Nitrous oxide from manure and soil was the second largest source accounting for, on average, 21% of the total emissions. Carbon sequestration reduced the emission intensities by 3% on average. When excluding soil C the difference between locations decreased in terms of GHG emission intensity, indicating that inclusion of soil C change is important when calculating emission intensities, especially when production of feed and use of pasture are included.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the opportunities for sustainable intensification requires an integrated assessment at field, farm and regional levels of past developments. Two hypotheses regarding current rice production in Central Luzon (Philippines) were developed for this purpose. First, we hypothesize that there are trade-offs between rice yields, labour productivity, gross margin and N use efficiency and, second, that farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic conditions at farm and regional level affect the management practices used by farmers. These hypotheses were tested using two household surveys characterizing rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon in terms of changes over time (1966–2012) and spatial variability. Over the past half-century there was an increase in the proportion of irrigated fields and adoption of improved varieties, which allowed the cultivation of a dry season rice crop in Central Luzon. Moreover, transplanting has been replaced by direct-seeding and herbicides substituted hand-weeding. These resulted in greater rice yields and labour productivity, and contributed to gradual transition from subsistence to commercial farming systems, as observed in the increasing proportion of hired labour and rice sold. Our results indicate the existence of a trade-off between rice yields, labour productivity and N use efficiency as yield levels maximising labour productivity and N use efficiency were ca. 25% and 35% lower than climatic potential yield in the wet and dry season, respectively. At field level, this can be explained by 1) the use of transplanting as crop establishment method, which resulted into higher yields but lower labour productivity as compared to direct-seeding, and 2) the high N application levels, which led to higher yields but lower N use efficiency. In contrast, yield levels which maximised gross margin were ca. 80% of the climatic potential in both wet and dry seasons, so there was little trade-off between rice yields and economic performance. Regarding the second hypothesis results were not always conclusive. As an example, N application per ha was negatively associated with farm size and the timing of the first fertiliser application positively associated with household size and with the number of parcels. More intensive practices, and better farm performance, were recorded in the province at the heart of the irrigation system. We thus conclude that closing rice yield gaps in the production systems of Central Luzon incurs trade-offs with environmental and social objectives at field and farm levels but less with economic objectives. However, we could not clearly show whether, and to what extent, management practices used by farmers are influenced by farm or regional level constraints.",

We used dairy farms inventories for two regions in Wisconsin to develop case studies to evaluate community-based processing. Minimum sale price of granulated manure varied between $360 and $460 per ton based on the region and the imposed aggregation radius. Granulation facilities were located on the farm with the largest herd in each case. Selection of farms for participation in granulation facility relied on both proximity and herd size. Sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze the impacts of market changes and subsidies on the investment. Community-based manure processing was found to offer an opportunity to facilitate processing and export of nutrients due to economies of scale advantage.",

    "abstract": "Perennial crops offer the opportunity to harvest from the same plant many times over several years while reducing labor and seed costs, reducing emissions and increasing biomass input into the soil. We use system dynamics modeling to combine data from field experiments, crop modeling and choice experiments to explore the potential for adoption and diffusion of a sustainable agriculture technology in a risky environment with high variability in annual rainfall: the perennial management of pigeonpea in maize-based systems of Malawi. Production estimates from a crop model for the annual intercrop system and data from field experiments on ratooning for the perennial system provided the information to create a stochastic production model. Data from choice experiments posed by a farmer survey conducted in three Malawi districts provide the information for parameters on farmers' preferences for the attributes of the perennial system. The perennial pigeonpea technology appeared clearly superior in scenarios where average values for maize yield and pigeonpea biomass production were held constant. Adoption was fastest in scenarios where relatively dry growing seasons showcased the benefits of the perennial system, suggesting that perennial management may be appropriate in marginal locations. The potential for adoption was reduced greatly when stochasticity in yields and seasons combine with significant social pressure to conform. The mechanism for this is that low yields suppress adoption and increase disadoption due to the dynamics of trust in the technology. This finding is not unique to perennial pigeonpea, but suggests that a critical factor in explaining low adoption rates of any new agricultural technology is the stochasticity in a technology's performance. Understanding how that stochasticity interacts with the social dynamics of learning skills and communicating trust is a critical feature for the successful deployment of sustainable agricultural technologies, and a novel finding of our study.",

    "abstract": "In this article we explore whether and how the dynamics of access shape the scaling of modern agricultural technologies. It is based on the experience of an agricultural research for development (AR4D) project called CASCAPE, which aims to validate and scale agricultural best practices for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. The socio-political dynamics of external interventions are often taken for granted contextual factors in AR4D projects. By contrast, this article takes this context as the point of departure for its analysis. The aim of this in-depth case study is to unpack the concept of access as condition for scaling of agricultural technologies. We identify and analyse the mechanisms that determine access to the various components of a malt barley technology package which was introduced in two highland communities in southern Ethiopia (and later 'scaled' to a range of other communities). Our research approach is technographic, implying that we consider the technology to contain both material and social components. The findings suggest that social and clan-based exchange mechanisms (such as clan-based loyalty, reciprocity and vertical accountability) are often rendered invisible even though they are of critical importance in governing access to the material and social components of modern agricultural technologies. Ignoring this socio-political context in the malt barley interventions resulted in an unintended scaling effect in terms of widening the social and economic gap between a few better off farmers and a larger group of poor farmers. The paper thus provides evidence that the socio-political dynamics of access to technology can have an important influence on its wide spread application and may complicate efforts to scale the uptake of technology. Paying more attention to such processes would help to improve the effectiveness of AR4D efforts.",

Farmers have a number of ex-ante and in-season options for coping with these events, and ex-post adjustments to farm-household portfolios to further limit the impact on livelihoods if these options fail. Adaptation-related research has focussed mainly on ex-ante or ex-post coping strategies, because in-season approaches tend to be seen as a given, meaning their cost effectiveness is ignored. Based on detailed survey data collected from 287 households in four of the main cropping systems in Pakistan, this study evaluates the impact pathways of hazards and the cost effectiveness of in-season coping strategies. Yield losses varied by 10–30% for 43% of the cases and by 31–50% for another 39%, with the most severe losses caused by the compounding effect of two hazards in one crop season or if both crops in a multi-crop rotation were affected simultaneously. In-season coping options were mostly restricted to the early crop stages and constrained by a short window of time for the response. The application of in-season coping strategies resulted in a yield recovery of 40–95%, with an additional cost of 4–34% of the value of recovered yield. The major critical moments identified were the harvest season, with farming often affected by un-seasonal precipitation, and the germination stage, with an additional high risk for low temperatures at high altitude. A better understanding of the differentiated risks and effectiveness of in-season coping strategies could support the promotion of sustainable crop production in similar agro-ecologies. Moreover, the effectiveness of present-day coping strategies, rather than the use of coping approaches itself, could signal a potential ability to adjust to future climate change.",

    "abstract": "Intercropping, i.e. mixed crop species cultivation on a field, can potentially reduce pressure on land and water resources by generating higher resource use efficiencies and crop yields through exploitation of complementarities between species. Intercropping systems in China and elsewhere have come under pressure through labor migration, growing water scarcity, changing crop prices and other factors. However, little hard evidence is available on how these socio-economic factors interplay and affect the prevalence of intercropping systems now and in the near future. The objective of this study is to explore the effect of growing scarcity of (water and labor) resources and declining (maize) grain prices on the share of intercropping in the optimal cropping plan and on associated agricultural income levels in an intercropping-dominated agricultural system in China. To undertake this analysis, we developed a mathematical programming model to simulate crop production for a model village in Gaotai county in the Hexi Corridor in northwest China, for given resources and economic conditions in 2013 and possible changes (scenarios) in the future. In the Hexi Corridor, conventional wheat/maize intercropping contributed greatly to rising food production while cash crops integrated with maize provided important cash income. With the introduction of seed crops and stricter water regulations, intercropping has become less prevalent in this area in recent years. In the absence of water constraints and at price levels and labor availability in 2013, our model results indicate that an optimal land use would entail that all land would be devoted to intercropping. Sole cumin and sole cotton enter the optimal cropping plan when water becomes scarce and the maize price declines substantially, while increases in hired labor wages have a strong negative impact on intercropping only when on-farm labor becomes scarce.",

    "abstract": "Human beings are dependent on ecosystems and the services they provide. Some services are currently being overexploited, resulting in degradation and further pressure on already vulnerable people in e.g., sub-Saharan Africa. Long-term and stable delivery of ecosystem services (ES) is suggested to be enhanced by more diversified farming systems that e.g., mix crops with trees and livestock. Despite the amount of research on ES, few previous studies have identified and compared the roles of trees and livestock for ES considering farm priorities within smallholder systems. We studied the role of trees and livestock for ES provision as well as farm priorities for smallholders in Kenya. Twenty smallholder farms (0.2–0.8 ha) were studied for 1 year in a fully factorial design of high or low tree and livestock density systems. Data were collected on indicators for provisioning (crop, tree and livestock production), supporting/regulating (water infiltration, soil organic carbon and nutrients) and cultural (recreation and aesthetics) ESs. In addition, farm priorities were studied, considering nutrient management, on- and off-farm resources, food and consumption, and crop, tree and livestock species diversity. A mix of qualitative (e.g., semi-structured interviews, seasonal calendar) and quantitative (e.g., soil analyses, infiltration tests) methods were used to collect data. This study confirmed roles of trees and livestock for ES and farm priorities, although they in some cases appeared less important than family labour and farm size. Results showed that high tree density was related to higher workload, lower proportions of off-farm revenue as well as higher crop, fruit and tree diversity for the household. Tree or livestock density showed no clear relation to provisioning, supporting or regulating ES. However, cultural services were on average provided more by trees than livestock. Available family labour was positively related to both farm production (provisioning services) and crop, tree and livestock species diversity. The use of manure, compost and mineral fertilisers was overall low, and the application rate per unit area seemed higher on farms with less land which was reflected in higher soil P and Ca concentrations. The challenges of already small and reducing farm sizes need to be targeted seriously in research and development efforts. Also the issue of labour requirement and pathways for mechanization must be addressed to attract a new generation farmers to develop sustainable and profitable farm enterprises providing ES to the farm and the surrounding landscape.",

    "abstract": "Recent agricultural transformation in Asia and Africa has witnessed the gradual spread of mechanization in agricultural areas that are still largely made up of smallholder farming. While the literature has often characterized mechanical technologies as being complementary to land, knowledge gaps exist with regard to the process of adoption of mechanization by smallholders for whom the scope for exploiting its complementarity with land is limited. We test a hypothesis that yield-enhancing biological technologies—which potentially raise total factor productivity and returns to more intensive farm-power use—are important drivers of the adoption of agricultural mechanization among smallholders. To enhance the external validity of evidence, we empirically analyze this hypothesis by applying the same methodologies in two countries, lowland (Terai) Nepal and Ghana. We employ nationally representative, repeated, cross-sectional data from both countries, as well as unique tractor-use data from Ghana; we also employ multidimensional indicators of agroclimatic similarity in the respective plant breeding locations. We show that in both lowland Nepal and Ghana, the adoption of tractors and agricultural equipment has been induced by yield-enhancing biological technologies, particularly improved varieties and high-yielding production systems, when these biological technologies are instrumented by agroclimatic similarity to plant breeding locations, which is measured accounting for the multidimensional characteristics of agroclimatic conditions, and thus proxies spillover potentials of the public sector developed biological technologies. In general, these effects are particularly strong among smaller farms, and the effect holds for the adoption of mechanization both at extensive margins (whether to adopt) and at intensive margins (how much to adopt). In Ghana, partly due to improved efficiency in supply-side factors of mechanization, these linkages have strengthened in the 2010s. The results suggest that in both countries, mechanization support strategies for smallholders can potentially improve their targeting by utilizing the information of agroclimatic similarity with plant breeding locations. In Ghana, further public investments in plant-breeding system in strategic locations may broadly enhance smallholders' demand for mechanization. In lowland Nepal where tractor adoptions have grown fairly high, it is now important to more carefully evaluate the trade-off between smallholder-based growth strategies and other strategies, for example, promoting scale-expansions of farming, which also involves mechanization.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is predicted to impose great pressures on crop yield and water quantity and quality. However, the connections among agriculture, climate condition, and water quality are supported by scant studies because of different scales of focus. The present study aimed on the interactions of crop yield, climate change, and water quality at field scale. Using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, and drawing on 12 dynamically downscaled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, the impacts of climate change on crop yield, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) losses were determined for a field in the Lake Erie basin under a corn-soybean rotation receiving solid cattle manure fertilization. The combined and individual impacts of different weather variables were evaluated with each of the 12 simulations. The mean cross-model climate change impacts included 16% and 14% increases in corn and soybean yield, respectively, as well as 4% rise and 22% decline in runoff and subsurface drainage DRP, respectively, resulting in an overall 11% decline in total DRP losses. An increase of temperature alone increased crop yields (12% for corn and 8% for soybean, respectively) as it decreased temperature stress resulted from delayed planting, which also decreased total DRP loss by 19%. Regardless of having a negligible impact on yield due to negligible water stress, increased precipitation increased total DRP loss by 15%. The research site could benefit from climate change in terms of both economic return and environmental quality, notwithstanding, greater attention should be paid to management practices with respect to soil DRP loss in surface runoff due to projected precipitation uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Policy-based or technological interventions are more likely to be effective if aligned with farmers' objectives, constraints, and decision-making processes. The objective of this study was to explore trade-offs and synergies of farming systems in response to innovative rice cultivation activities by understanding current farming systems, main drivers impacting farm management and farmers' perspectives on rice intensification. Understanding these interrelations is key in rice production areas, where smallholder farmers largely depend on growing rice to subsist. A rapid system analysis was conducted interviewing 20 farmers in 4 villages along the Senegal River Valley (SRV) to obtain a general view on farm functioning and farmers' perspectives on farming systems. A detailed system analysis with four farmers was subsequently conducted to provide an insight into the underlying processes regulating farm management. A multi-objective optimization model was used to quantitatively evaluate and explore farm performances based on four selected indicators representing: rice production, household agricultural profit, household labour and farm nutrient balance. The results of this study showed that government programmes and farmers' Unions were strongly influencing farmers' decision-making in agricultural production. Farmers also reported that although rice was still essential for their livelihoods, there were transitions towards less rice production in the wet season with short duration rice varieties and more vegetable production. Both farmers' interviews and the modelling results suggested that farmers would be unlikely to increase or even maintain the area of rice double cropping, which has been strongly promoted by the Senegalese government. Instead, farmers would rather keep investing in vegetable production. This modelling study shows the consequences of policy-based and technological interventions for farming systems and may inform both policy makers and farmers in situations where objectives are strongly divergent. Hence, modelling outcomes may be used to inspire discussion and innovation in order to align the government priority of ensuring national food security and farmers' objectives and constraints in the SRV.",

    "abstract": "There is growing recognition that sustainable development of smallholder agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a systems approach. One response to this has been applying the agricultural innovation systems concept and the use of Innovation Platforms (IP) as tools for agricultural development. By providing social space and facilitating interactions among farmers, researchers and other stakeholders, IPs can promote collective action and foster innovation. The question is, how effective are these IPs in stimulating innovation that can be sustained beyond their lifetime, and can they be used to link issues across multiple scales? The case study reported here examined the effect of a multilevel IP structure in achieving smallholder livestock innovation outcomes in the Ethiopian Highlands. Two years after the multilevel IPs were phased out, focus group discussions and key informant interviews with multiple stakeholders from all levels of the IP were undertaken to collect qualitative data on the innovation processes and analysed using thematic analysis. Our findings indicate that a series of IPs inter-linked across scales facilitated researcher-led technical innovations that enhanced farmers and livestock experts' capacity around feed technologies. The multilevel IPs also improved linkages and strengthened partnerships between actors within and across levels to effectively implement farm-level technologies. However, sustained innovation requires creating a shared understanding among actors on the complex nature of the various value chain issues that need to be addressed to achieve meaningful change. Specifically, we found that farmers lack access to affordable services. This requires integrating value chain concepts within multilevel IPs at the early stages of formation to engage relevant actors across levels to stimulate multiple interventions beyond the farm-level. Changes are needed at the organisational level to facilitate reconfiguration of resources and devolution of responsibilities to support the innovation process. The existence of power dynamics and an institutional context favouring the status quo are key issues that need to be considered when building and evaluating effective multilevel IPs to achieve inclusive value chain innovations.",

    "abstract": "Intensive broiler production systems are criticized by EU citizens because of their negative impact on animal welfare, the environment and human health. To inform the development of sustainable broiler production systems, this paper provides insight in the synergies and trade-offs between different external factors originating from broiler production systems by developing a new analysis approach. The approach was applied to the Dutch conventional, New Dutch Retail Standard and Extensive Indoor+ systems. The latter two systems have more stringent standards on animal welfare relative to the conventional system. Four external factors were considered, i.e. animal welfare (indicated by Welfare Quality Index score), ammonia emission (kg NH3/animal place/year), particulate matter emission (g PM10/animal place/year) and antibiotic use (defined daily doses animal). Results show that the shift from a fast-growing breed towards a slower-growing breed caused synergy by improving animal welfare and lowering antibiotic use. Furthermore, the reduction in protein content of the feed, and possibly the reduction in stocking density, caused synergy by enhancing animal welfare and lowering ammonia emission. System changes that stimulated activity, such as the reduction in stocking density, enhanced animal welfare but caused a trade-off with particulate matter emission. Although the New Dutch Retail Standard and Extensive Indoor+ system were characterized by a higher ammonia and particulate matter emission per animal place per year relative to the conventional system, experts estimated that these emissions were partially (New Dutch Retail Standard) or fully (Extensive Indoor+) offset at farm level via a lower stocking density. Overall, we conclude that future development of broiler production systems can exploit the synergy between animal welfare, antibiotic use, and ammonia emission and minimize the trade-off between animal welfare and particulate matter emission. The insights obtained from this paper can support the development of sustainable broiler production systems that minimize external factors originating from these systems.",

    "abstract": "Teff is an important food-security crop for millions of people in Ethiopia. The demand for teff products is also increasing globally due to its health benefits as a gluten-free grain. However, teff productivity is low compared with other cereals. Crop yields vary widely among farms in rainfed production system. Identifying the key crop management practices and soil properties responsible for these variations will help to raise crop productivity through informed decision making by farmers, experts, researchers, and policy makers. The objectives of this study were to assess the characteristics of the Ethiopian teff-cropping system, quantify the variability of grain yields among farms, and identify the impacts of different crop management practices and soil fertility parameters on yield variability. The study examined 82 teff farms at three sites representing different teff-growing agro-ecologies in Ethiopia. Practices used to manage crops and soil on each farm were assessed. Composite topsoil samples were collected from farms at each site and analyzed for selected physical and chemical parameters. Grain and straw yields were quantified when crops were matured. Descriptive statistics, and factor analysis followed by multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that caused the variability of yields among farms. Teff yields were highly variable within and across different agro-ecologies. The crop management factors that greatly affected yields were N and P application rates and days to harvesting. The most important soil characteristics were total nitrogen, texture and micronutrients. Poor teff yields were attributable to failure to implement improved agronomic practices, poor soil fertility, and inefficient production systems. Teff production system is a low-yielding, less-profitable, and resource-intensive enterprise. The observed variations in yields among farms indicated that there is a big opportunity to improve teff productivity. The high frequency of tillage, monocropping, and complete removal of crop residues were major causes of the low soil fertility. Understanding teff yield variability among farms helps to design appropriate yield improvement strategies. The use of low-cost crop-intensification options such as planting of improved cultivars using improved sowing methods, reduced tillage, incorporation of crop residues and legume-based crop rotation could sustainably improve productivity and restore soil fertility with minimal increases of costs in rainfed teff production system.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) varies widely among farmers, from no ISFM to multiple computations of ISFM components (i.e., improved germplasm, organic resources, fertilizers, and local adaptations e.g., soil and water conservation (SWC)). There is no comprehensive report on farmers' use of ISFM components and their impact on sustainable intensification domains of productivity, economic, social, human condition, and environment and the associated variations across farmer fields and agro-ecological zones (AEZs). This study 1) evaluated the current implementation status of ISFM by farmers in relation to the various ISFM components and 2) provided multi-dimensional multi-scale evidence of ISFM implications that can guide ISFM investments within SSA contexts, with a specific focus on Tanzania. We used data collected from 1406 plots between 2013 and 2020 in semi-arid and sub-humid AEZs. The data are from farmer practices. The plots were grouped by the various combinations of ISFM components implemented and analysed using Tukey's test to examine the association of ISFM use with selected indicators within a domain. The number of ISFM components used by farmers is higher in sub-humid (1 to 4) than in semi-arid AEZ (0 to 3). Except for SWC used by 40% of farmers in both AEZs, the proportion of farmers using improved seeds (95%) and manure (55%) in the sub-humid AEZ are more than double those using these ISFM components in the semi-arid AEZ. Productivity and economic benefits increase with the number of ISFM components at the expense of higher labour demand. Increasing plot-level ISFM benefits also translate to increased household-level whole-farm income but contributions to human nutrition are unclear. The contribution to SOC by increasing ISFM is insignificant, compounded by strong effects of slope position of the field. Differential access to resources, decision-making and control rights drive the number and choice of the specific ISFM components. Understanding of ISFM impacts across domains is essential to guide the scaling of ISFM in Tanzania and beyond and therefore recommended in future studies.",

    "abstract": "A mismatch between nutrient demand and consumption in livestock and cropping systems makes these sectors responsible for 24.5% of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reduce the gap between the two industries, approaches focused on integrating livestock and crop management have been presented. Location is a key factor in the sustainable operation of these integrated systems since this variable affects both the economic and environmental dimensions of the design of the farm. In this work, a two-step methodology is proposed to address simultaneously the formulation of the feed, the design of the nutrient recovery process, the location of the facilities, and its size, from economic and environmental points of view. First, prescreening is used to discard locations that do not meet a series of environmental constraints. Next, an optimization framework is developed by integrating empirical models that estimate the nutritional needs of the animals, fertilizer consumption, waste production, as well as the effect of selection of locations and the size of the farm on the objective function. The farm is designed to produce the feed on the premises and animal wastes are used to produce fertilizers and biogas, implementing the circular economy. The optimization framework is used to estimate the optimal feed formulation, crop selection, size and location, following a multi-objective approach. The methodology is applied to a case study in Spain. Of the 345 agricultural districts considered, 145 are discarded in the prescreening. The optimal number of initial animals is 1000. The results show that the selection of 'Bureba-Ebro' and a crop distribution that consumes 12% less nutrients than the economic scenario, results in the reduction of 35% in the environmental impact. In addition, meat production cost is 8.87€/kg (1.6€/kg corresponds to the waste treatment). Nevertheless, it can be reduced down to 1.51€/kg by considering the income from crop sales. Only through this integrated framework it is possible to determine the feed formulation and facility location that best balance the economic and environmental objective, and determines the percentage of nutrients that can be recovered. The methodology is generic enough to be applied to other locations, crops, and animals.",

We evaluate how the informal exchange of information about epidemic and economic outcomes can influence the management decisions of individuals and the resulting epidemics, in the context of the avocado laurel wilt epidemic in south Florida. In scenario analyses, we addressed how socioeconomic networks, laurel wilt epidemic networks, policy incentive structures, and social behaviors combine to influence (a) information exchange across this region, (b) growers' decisions about disease management, and (c) epidemic spread and yield loss. We identified the scenarios in which regional avocado health fared best. We built an agent-based model to simulate laurel wilt epidemic expansion and establishment across south Florida over a 10-year period. The model used parameters specific to patterns observed and quantified from the laurel wilt epidemic in south Florida. Based on the locations and sizes of avocado orchards there, we simulated disease expansion and information dissemination through multilayer socioeconomic and epidemic networks and evaluated the effects of \"carrot\" and \"stick\" policy incentive structures and behaviors like \"stubbornness\" in decision making. Scenarios were simulated for multiple parameters across a 10-year time period, and the regional health of avocado and management decisions of growers were analyzed. Increased social connections led to lower regional crop health due to increased exchange of information reinforcing selection of less expensive but less effective management choices. This information exchange was particularly impactful during the lag phase of epidemic expansion, when the cost of disease management outweighed the cost of disease. Managers who were resistant or \"stubborn\" against adopting these less expensive and less effective management strategies, particularly during the lag phase of epidemic expansion, contributed to greater regional health. In these scenarios, growers responded more to policies which penalized individuals than to policies which rewarded individuals. By quantifying varying degrees of stubbornness, and how growers may weight past experiences and new information, we represented key aspects of decision making and its many influences on regional collective action in this novel agent-based model. The model demonstrates the caveats of information exchange across social networks during epidemics, and the valuable role that policy makers and informed educators can have, particularly during the lag phase of epidemic expansion. Decision makers and stakeholders must understand the influences of information exchange to overcome the challenges of collective action for crop health.",

    "abstract": "Current research emphasises that agricultural innovation projects are influenced in multiple ways by the Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) in which they operate. Yet little attention has been paid to the reverse direction of this relationship, i.e. how agricultural innovation projects affect AIS in the course of their innovative activities. Accordingly, there are currently no tools to measure such AIS spillovers from agricultural innovation projects. This paper shows that even where agricultural innovation projects have not been designed with the explicit aim of influencing AIS they can have spillovers on the AIS in which they operate. Based on this finding, it argues that designing agricultural innovation projects in a way that maximises such positive and reduces negative AIS spillovers would be a useful tool for strengthening agricultural innovation capacities in a particular territory or sector. Based on the concept of agricultural innovation projects as Organisational Innovation Systems (OIS) that are embedded in AIS, the paper develops an analytical framework for assessing spillovers of such projects on AIS and applies it to a case study of an Operational Group in the German Federal State of Hessen. The case study shows that agricultural innovation projects may yield diverse spillovers on the AIS in which they operate. In addition to considering how agricultural innovation projects are shaped – constrained and/or enabled – by AIS, the research community on agricultural innovation should pay more attention to this side of the interrelation of AIS and agricultural innovation projects. Designing agricultural innovation projects responsibly so that spillovers on AIS are monitored can help to improve national or sectoral AIS. This paper points to an underexplored issue in research on agricultural innovation and, related to this, a thus far unused potential policy tool for improving national and sectoral AIS. It further develops the concept of innovation projects as OIS into an approach for assessing the effects of projects on AIS; an area of project assessment that until now has not been adequately covered.",

    "abstract": "Cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) stock can be increased by agricultural management, but is subject to various factors. The extent and rates of SOC sequestration potential, as well as the controlling factors, under different climate and management practices across a region or country are important for policy-makers and land managers, however have been rarely known. We aim to investigate the extent and rates of SOC sequestration potential over 2021–2040 under different scenarios of climate change and Sustainable Soil Management (SSM) practices, and quantify the impacts of climate change and SSM practices on the SOC sequestration potential, for croplands across Finland at a spatial resolution of 1 km. RothC model is run iteratively to equilibrium to calculate the size of the SOC pools and the annual plant carbon inputs. Then, it is applied to investigate the SOC sequestration potential over 2021–2040 under different scenarios of climate change and SSM practices. Finally, facorial simulation experiments are conducted to quantify the impacts of climate change and SSM practices, alone and in combination, on SOC sequestration potential. Under the combined impacts of climate change and SSM practices, the SOC sequestration potential during 2021–2040 relative to 2020 will be on average − 0.03, 0.007, 0.05, and 0.13 t C ha−1 yr−1, respectively, with carbon input being business as usual, 5%, 10%, and 20% increase. This is equivalent to an annual change rate of −0.04%, 0.009%, 0.07%, and 0.17%, respectively. Therefore, a 20% increase in C input to soil will not be enough to obtain a 4‰ increase per year over the 20-year period in Finland. Carbon input will promote SOC sequestration potential; however, climate change will reduce it on average by 0.28 t C ha−1 yr−1. Across the cropland in Finland, on average, the relative contributions of C input, temperature, and precipitation to SOC sequestration potential in 2021–2040 will be 56%, 24%, and 20%, respectively, however there is a spatially explicit pattern. The SOC sequestration potential will be relatively high and dominated by C input in west and southwest Finland. By contrast, it will be relatively low and dominated by climate in north and east Finland, and the central part of southern Finland. Our findings provide the information as to where, how much, and which SSM practices could be applied for enhancing SOC sequestration at a high spatial resolution, which is essential for stakeholders to increase cropland SOC sequestration efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The southwestern United States is experiencing an increasingly warmer and drier climate that is affecting cattle production systems of the region. Adaptation strategies are needed that will not compromise environmental quality or profitability. Options include the use of desert-adapted beef cattle biotypes, such as Rarámuri Criollo cattle, and crossbreds of Criollo with more traditional British breeds. Currently, most calves raised in the Southwest are grain finished, often with irrigated crops produced in the hydrologically-threatened Ogallala Aquifer region. A viable alternative may be grass finishing with the rainfed forage of the arid and semi-arid rangeland of the Southwest or in the temperate grasslands of the Northern Plains. Compare the environmental impacts and production costs of grain-finishing in Texas and grass-finishing in the Northern plains and the Southwest with traditional Angus cattle vs. Criollo and Criollo x Angus cattle. Nine supply chain strategies were simulated using the Integrated Farm System Model to compare farm-gate life cycle intensities of greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint), fossil energy footprint, nitrogen footprint, blue water footprint and production costs using representative (appropriate soils, climate, and management) ranch and feedlot operations. For both finishing options (grass, grain), Criollo x Angus cattle had the best environmental (3%–27% lower), and production cost (4–23% lower) outcomes followed by pure Criollo and then Angus cattle. Crossbred production combined the lower feed supplementation requirements of Criollo cows with heavier final carcasses of offspring from Angus genetics. Crossbred cattle with grass finishing in the Southwest or Northern Plains outperformed on most environmental variables as well as production costs, mostly due to reduced external input requirements (primarily feed). A downside for grass-finished crossbreds was greater carbon footprint (27–42% higher) compared to grain finishing due to greater methane emissions from high forage diets and an extended time to finish. On grasslands where soil C sequestration can be supported, that land-based sequestration may offset the greater greenhouse gas emission from enteric methane of grass-finished beef. Grass finishing in the Northern Plains may provide a more reliable meat supply chain than grass finishing in the Southwest due to the lower risk and less severe consequences of drought. Alternative beef supply chain options using Rarámuri Criollo cattle were found to be sustainable production systems that can be adopted by ranchers in the southwestern United States to adapt to the changing climate.",

In pursuit to expand the knowledge base on climate change effects on crops in underreported regions, we present herein data from Chile and Tunisia on the vulnerability of cherry and peach orchards to climate change and on possible measures to counter its impact. We aimed to ascertain a) the extent to which fruit farming biophysical operations in Chile and Tunisia are vulnerable to climate change impacts, b) whether the vulnerability can be reduced through agronomic, technological or financial adaptive measures and, c) how to overcome challenges that may prevent implementation of these measures. The study is based on face-to-face interviews with 801 peach and cherry farmers in Tunisia and Chile and three focus meetings with farm representatives. Fruit farmers have used and are planning to use a number of agricultural, technological, and financial tools to reduce the vulnerability of their crops to climate change. Agronomical measures are focused on planting varieties with higher drought and disease resistance as well as lower winter chill requirements. Technological measures focus on installing nets reflects farmer regional experiences with crop hail damage and rain at the fruit maturing stage. Planned improvements in irrigation reflect anticipated future problems with water availability and drought. The decision not to implement adaptive measures is mainly linked to economic barriers. Specific actions are proposed to overcome these and other measure implementation barriers. The self-reported experiences of fruit farmers provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of various climate change adaptive measures, which often differ from scientific expectations or recommendations. For example, farmers are not overly concerned about fulfilling winter chill requirements, they are also not well informed about all available climate change adaptive tools. In addition, many adaptive measures are not implemented due to administrative or financial barriers. To help address this, regionally-led cooperation between farmers, policy makers, industry, and scientists is needed to identify and overcome these barriers, allowing for the successful implementation of appropriate adaptive measures.",

    "abstract": "The economic and environmental sustainability of farming systems is under increased pressure from extreme climate variability and market volatility. The diversification of large-scale farms can increase profits, resilience, and deliver sustainability outputs. To (a) propose a farm diversification framework specifically designed for large-scale commercial farms; and (b) demonstrate its application to assess the benefits and trade-offs associated with alternative diversification options for a case-study farm in Northern Queensland, Australia. A literature review and discussions with large-scale commercial farmers, a Natural Resource Management NGO, and a regional council were used to co-design our framework. The framework was then used to guide discussions with a case-study farmer and conduct a participatory modelling exercise on alternative cropping-based diversification scenarios. We used a simulation model to produce quantitative information on the present and co-designed alternative scenarios, to iteratively inform discussions with the participating case-study farmer. The simulated scenarios included (i) the current system of dryland (non-irrigated) monocropping of cotton, (ii) a dryland cotton-maize rotation, (iii) an irrigated cotton-maize rotation, and (iv) an irrigated maize-mungbean-cotton rotation. The benefits and trade-offs of each scenario were assessed across five performance measures: downside risk, profit, water-use efficiency, ground cover and, from the discussion with the participating farmer, the skills needed to de-risk the diversification process. Results from the co-designed scenarios showed that adding dryland maize as a rotation crop can reduce downside risks by 12.5% and increase fractional ground cover by more than two-fold, i.e., from 20% to >40%, compared to the current system. The use of irrigation in the cropping system increased the median gross margin by $2000 ha−1 and reduced downside risks to zero. The water-use efficiencies of the proposed irrigated scenarios were similar. Farmers reported that developing skills in irrigated cropping could increase their capacity to dynamically chose more profitable crops to sow with certainty of higher returns, but it would require up-front investments in terms of money and time. Our proposed framework can be used to assess benefits and trade-offs of alternative farm diversification options across a range of performance dimensions (risk; profit; resource-use efficiency; skills). These assessments will ensure that the co-designed options are evaluated across multiple dimensions, all within the local context of the study and farmers' preference(s) and circumstances. The use of a co-design approach can be expected to increase learnings for all those involved and increase the chances of practice change and adoption.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of social interactions (social ties) to farming systems' resilience is widely recognized. However, controversies exist around the contribution that farmers interacting with external actors (weak/bridging ties) versus with other farmers (strong/bonding ties) have in their resilience strategies through innovation. Farmers use different strategies to respond to their farming systems and contexts' particularities. Comparing the contribution of both strong and weak ties in different farming systems brings variety in resilience strategies. To generate evidence of the complementary contribution of social ties to resilience by comparing indexes associated with strong and weak ties from innovation networks of different farm types. This paper applies an ego-centric social network analysis to farm units characterized by a farm typology to compare their strong/bonding and weak/binding ties contribution to innovation networks. It uses data from 29,796 farm units of maize smallholders in different regions from Central and Southern Mexico covering the gradient from commercial to subsistence farming. The analysis estimates two indexes based on actors' similarity/dissimilarity, that are External and Internal and Specialization Indexes. Our findings quantify differential contributions of strong versus weak ties to resilience strategies associated with innovation networks among different types of small-scale maize farmers. They demonstrate how differences among five farm types regarding farm resources access, maize production systems and farmers' social attributes influence their innovation networks. A gradient exists between farm types in their innovation network indexes regarding the contribution of strong versus weak ties. Commercial farmers, as the winners of the modernization process, have better access to resources and establish a wider variety of relationships with weak ties. However, interactions with other farmers are essential for technology adoption. In contrast, weak ties represented by institutions have a minor participation in innovation networks of diversified income and subsistence farm units. Strong ties dominate these farm types producing maize for consumption as part of their persistence strategies. Low-mechanized and elder family farm types, affected by geographic remoteness and population ageing processes, represent intermediate points in the gradient of farm resources and network indexes. Jointly farm typology and social network approaches open new avenues to enhance farming system resilience. These approaches show how farmers establish their social interactions for innovation, creating specific combinations of strong and weak ties that are farm type specific. Diverse resilience strategies appear from these combinations involving not only adaptation but also persistence strategies that require further exploration.",

Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is an appropriate indicator for assessing N utilisation on farms. The aim of the study was to evaluate N performance of the German agricultural sector, to generate knowledge gain regarding methodological design and estimating N indicators based on farm accounting data, to estimate the role and extent of externalities, and to increase understanding of interrelations between farm characteristics and N performance in order to support policymakers in finding targeted N mitigation measures. Using data from the German Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) covering 5923 farms between the years 2016/17 and 2018/19, we calculated mean farm-level NUE and N balance values for six farm types, considering input and output parameters on farm level as well as externalities. We also developed two explanatory models to identify interrelations between N performance indicators investigated, and regional, socio-economic and farm structural characteristics. The results indicated an increasing trend in NUE from dairy, to pig and poultry, and arable farms, but large variance within each farm type, indicating efficiency reserves in N use. Livestock farms undercut NUE and exceed N surpluses to such an extent that the sustainability goal for 2030 for the national N balance as defined in German Sustainable Development Strategy could be jeopardised. Different levels of externalisation, namely feed imports and manure exports, may deepen this gap. Multiple regression analysis revealed statistically significant interrelations between N performance and independent variables such as soil fertility, crop selection and diversity, production type, operating profit and consulting services received. Thereby, structural patterns and strategies in order to reduce N waste and increase NUE were identified. However, main source of uncertainty was due to the lack on imported manure amounts from FADN data. Determination of N performance can improve understanding the complexity of agri-environmental interrelations and support policymakers in designing appropriate policies to improve N management.",

    "abstract": "Serious games have gained popularity as an innovative participatory approach to explore the complexity of social-ecological systems, managing the trade-offs between economic and ecological targets. Serious games can be abstract and generic, or more complex and specific. They can be used to raise awareness, increase shared understanding of options and risks, and/or commitment to common goals. We here aim to clarify design principles applied in the FORCES game (Farmer Options and its Risk in Complex Ecological-Social systems) as single-player game to be easily adaptable to diverse (upper) watershed contexts. Three steps involved are game design (balance generic and site-specific information), game use in (and possibly adaptation to) specified context(s) and evaluation of contextualized impacts. The FORCES game design was based on three contrasting watershed case studies in East Java, Indonesia, rather than on single, specific case study. Game development consisted of preparation (defining the context, generic core issues and game objectives), development process (ideating, setting the actors, resources, elements, and mechanisms), and assessment (prototyping, exploration of solution space, game trial and player feedback). Fifty-five smallholders played the FORCES in three landscapes to test the game's performance and impact on participants' insights. Therefore, we recorded every game session and performed pre- and post-game interviews for each participant. The developed FORCES game focuses on decisions of individual farmers involving plot-level plant (annual crops, trees) choices with financial cost-benefits consequences and links to ecological impacts on the litter layer, water balance, and erosion. The FORCES game was successfully applied in three distinct landscapes, demonstrating its adaptability. The game's generic water balance supported the transferability to different contexts, while fine-tuning of plot management options to reflect local variation was simple due to the solid underlying game mechanics. According to players, the game reflects local dynamics in the landscapes and provides a realistic experience, triggering participants to make decisions close to their real-life choices and learn from the consequences. While the game has limited representation of social interactions due to its single-player design, FORCES allowed relational values to be recognized in players' responses. Balancing the combination of generic setting with easily adaptable site-specific elements in the game design plays an essential role to increase game adaptability and reusability to different locations. FORCES adds to the growing array of games that can be used to support farmers' participation in higher-level decision-making processes to secure environmental services in productive landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Drought-tolerant maize (DTM) varieties and other agricultural technologies can play an important role in maintaining crop production and livelihoods, yet their uptake remains low. Most research on risks in agriculture only considers climate risks as a barrier to adopting agricultural technologies. Farming communities face other agricultural risks related to health, finances, markets, and institutions. These risk perceptions may be different for male and female farmers. We explore the agricultural risk perceptions of male and female smallholder farmers, assessing gender roles and norms and their influence on risk perceptions. Subsequently, we discuss the implications of these perceptions and gender roles and norms on the uptake of drought-tolerant maize varieties in Uganda. We conducted a qualitative study with men's and women's focus groups in twelve villages in three districts in Uganda. We used participatory rural appraisal tools with each group to structure the discussions. Production risks, health risks, social norms, and financial constraints may play an important role in smallholder agricultural decision-making. These risks are inseparable and different for men's and women's groups. Women tend to prioritize climate and crop management risks, while men place more weight on financial constraints. The perceived impact of health risks, risks related to social norms, and market risks vary across men and women in different districts. Dokolo reflects more traditional gender roles, while Iganga and Masindi note more contested gendered power over maize cultivation. The risk and concern ranking in Dokolo shows more similarity between men and women compared to Iganga and Masindi. Women tend to have less access to DTM varieties in the formal seed system, while they tend to have fewer resources to mitigate health and crop production risks. To reach and benefit more women with DTM varieties, we draw attention to access to information, bringing seed closer (potentially subsidized), gender transformative interventions, and investment in open-pollinated varieties disseminated through the informal seed system. Our research emphasizes the importance of considering multiple risks in agriculture when promoting resilient farming systems rather than focusing solely on climate risk. We also show the importance of applying a gender lens to these risks and the uptake of DTM varieties. Serving as an inclusive and pro-poor risk management technology, DTM would benefit from ensuring that the technology becomes available to male and female farmers in multiple seed systems, including formal seed systems (primarily hybrids) and informal seed systems (primarily open-pollinated varieties).",

    "abstract": "In French mountain territories, origin-linked quality schemes have been widely used to address competition from more productive regions, but such schemes have tended to specialise a territory's agriculture around specific products. Today, these territories are marked by the arrival of \"left-returned\" and new residents, who develop alternative production methods and grassroot initiatives based on agroecological principles and food production relocation. The different groups within the territories hold different visions of what should be agriculture and may confront each other. Sustainable agrifood transformations need to account for the diversity of visions among the variety of actors to enrich transition pathways. The aim of this article is to analyse relationships among a diversity of agrifood actors who have different visions of agriculture in a territory in order to characterise the structure of their relationships and the key actors. More specifically, it seeks, first, to analyse whether actors sharing the same characteristics interact more or not, and whether individual attributes stimulate or constrain relations among the diverse range of actors; and second, to characterise the key actors (i.e. prestigious and brokers) and their roles. The study was conducted in a French alpine territory specialising in extensive dairy cattle breeding to produce protected designation of origin (PDO) cheese. We use mixed methods, combining a social network analysis (regression models, and homophily and centrality indicators) with semi-structured interviews to analyse the discussion network of the diverse actors involved in agriculture and food in the Bauges (including farmers, elected officials, processors, distributors, members of civil society, and employees of agricultural and local development institutions). The analysis showed that there is no homophily within the actor typologies, and that relations were concentrated within the territory. Some actors were more important for developing ties, especially the employees of agricultural and local development institutions, who were more solicitated by others. However, the results revealed homophily among non-native actors, although they are driving force in the development of ties, demonstrating both their ability to forge links and relational barriers with natives. After that, the most influential broker actor was the park employee in charge of agriculture, who holds a pluralist vision and has a central role in gathering different actors together and bringing them into dialogue. The most prestigious actors were the park employee, a civil society actor, and four farmers. These actors all fulfil three main functions: to guide practices and visions within their group as key actors often hold a clear-cut vision, to bind heterogeneous groups together (although this does not prevent tensions and conflict with these actors), and to link institutional levels, often by virtue of being heads of networks and municipal councillors. However, the methodology did not allow the integration of more isolated actors, especially dairy cattle breeders, who should be included more deeply in further research. To better understand the dynamics of sustainable agrifood transformations, the relational approach enables analysis of the patterns of relationships between multiple actors with different agricultural visions, and to characterise the key actors and their roles. From the perspective of accompanying agrifood transformations, it is helpful to understand the relational structures between the actors in order to avoid the possible conflicts that could arise in such research. Moreover, it is useful to identify and mobilise key actors in order to facilitate researchers' entry into a territory and increase participation.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that diversified cropping systems can contribute to the fundamental reorientation of food production. However, actors involved in crop diversification (CD) initiatives often lack concrete action perspectives, i.e., ideas and expectations on what they can do to achieve their goals. Indeed, various authors have pointed out the lack of operational guidance by high-level theories on innovation governance for actors in innovation niches that have to cope with complexity and unpredictability. This paper aims to fill this gap by studying and cross-analysing the enactment of 25 Case Studies (CSs) consisting of multi-actor CD initiatives spread across 10 European countries. We developed a heuristic framework that aimed to unpack the key components in the CSs' ways of working towards CD (motivations, participants, intervention levels, activities and learnings). Data collection was based on reflexive self-assessment documents produced by the CSs as part of the actor-oriented co-innovation approach. We cross-analysed the data to highlight patterns among the CSs in their ways of working towards CD using both qualitative and quantitative (Multiple Factor Analysis) approaches, in order to provide a diversity of insights to support action perspectives. Seven groups of CSs were defined and qualified through the qualitative approach. Group 1 worked on fostering co-learning between farmers and developing participatory approaches. Group 2 specifically worked on enhancing cooperation between farmers. Group 3 promoted strip cropping through the development of a community of practice. Group 4 was concerned with gradually removing lock-ins to support the introduction of diversifying crops. Group 5 worked at aligning actors to create value chains to enhance grain legume production. Group 6 was about fostering locally integrated food systems for legumes and vegetables. And, Group 7 gathered CSs searching for ways out of wicked situations. The results from the MFA partially confirmed these similarities between the CSs but also revealed major differences between some CSs that were identified as similar with the qualitative approach. In this paper, we propose a framework to describe how actors within innovation niches organized themselves, worked and learned together to stimulate a transition towards more sustainability in food systems. We assume that this framework, is usable by other project leaders of innovation niches to monitor and analyse their change processes towards sustainability jointly with practitioners. Grouping the CSs is a way to scale out these learnings and contribute to the production of action perspectives and mobilizing impact that are useful for people both inside and outside our project.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, livestock farming has been in the spotlight. Meat production is blamed for the pollution of aquifers and rivers, as well as for the large amount of water required to feed livestock. This has highlighted the need to find alternative feeding systems for cattle breeding able to reduce food/feed competition. In this context, the present study compares the water footprint (WF) of conventionally fed beef versus beef fed with vegetable by-products from the local agri-food industry. Twenty-four entire male young bulls were reared under the Ternera de Navarra Protected Geographic Identification (PGI) in the town of Azoz, in Navarra, Spain. Twelve calves were fattened on a diet based on vegetable by-products and fodder and grain to complement the ration (VBP diet) and the remaining animals were fattened with a traditional diet based on concentrate and straw (conventional or control diet). Once the fattening was finished and animals were slaughtered, the results showed a larger green, blue and grey WF in terms of m3 per beef cattle for conventionally fed animals compared to those fed with VBP. However, when looking at the efficiency, the results were mixed. Conventionally fed cattle exhibited lower green and grey WFs but a higher blue WF compared to VBP-fed cattle, with values of 9955 l/kg, 1577 l/kg and 1731 l/kg versus 10,147 l/kg, 1457 l/kg and 1831 l/kg of carcass beef, respectively. This means that a by-product-based calf diet can reduce blue water use. However, further research is needed on the indirect water pollution associated with animal-fed crop production.",

    "abstract": "Human-Centered Design (HCD) is an open-ended, iterative, and creative approach to problem solving. HCD is increasingly applied in CGIAR, a global AR4D consortium, to overcome problems with adoption, use, and inclusiveness of innovations. With the current digital transformation in food, land, and water systems HCD is gaining more traction. HCD is a process that can help create solutions that are adopted by users and are more inclusive. But the potential of HCD is strongly influenced by the organizational context that surrounds the design process. In this article, we want to increase the understanding of the organizational embeddedness of HCD as a process and contribute to the ongoing discussion around the role and operationalization of HCD in AR4D. We provide a reflection and discussion on the challenges and opportunities for HCD implementation in CGIAR and provide recommendations to increase systematic HCD integration into CGIAR innovation processes. We are building on the literature as well as the experience of the authors in facilitating HCD processes in CGIAR. We complement this by applying a simple maturity survey developed by Nielsen Norman Group, a global UX consulting firm. This maturity survey gives a more structured idea of the organizational situation in different areas with regards to HCD implementation and effectiveness. We identify a few action areas to improve HCD implementation in CGIAR. We identify three main areas that have a strong influence on HCD processes in CGIAR. A global driver for HCD is the digital transformation in food, land, and water systems: the sharp contrast between available tools and the low number of adoptions and lack of inclusivity drives the search for new ways of doing innovation research. At the organizational level of CGIAR, mindset and funding mechanisms have a strong influence on HCD implementation, presenting both challenges and opportunities. The organizational maturity, meaning how strategically HCD is integrated in organizational culture, strategy, processes, and outcomes, is relatively low in CGIAR. The importance of discussion on how AR4D should develop innovations that are adopted, are inclusive, and are scalable is reflected in the current reform in CGIAR. This article provides a perspective on HCD as a process-based, open-ended, and creative approach to problem solving that can help address this challenge. This can inform strategy and operationalization of HCD in CGIAR and AR4D in general.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Agricultural systems involve intricate interdependencies among water, energy, and food. Increasing understanding of these linkages, along with implications for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and developing new assessment approaches are critical for achieving key sustainability goals. OBJECTIVES: 1) Evaluation of the impacts of tillage, irrigation and residue management practices on water and energy consumption, and GHG emission in the cultivation of irrigated wheat and rapeseed, 2) Developing a novel Water-Energy-Food-Greenhouse gas (WEFG) nexus index to provide a holistic assessment of the linkages among water, energy, food, and GHG emissions in agriculture, and 3) Assessing the sustainability of irrigated wheat and rapeseed cultivation under different methods of tillage, irrigation and residue management applying the WEFG nexus index. METHODS: This study formulated a new WEFG nexus index applying eight indicators of water and energy consumption, CO2-eq (CO2 equivalent) emission, water and energy mass productivity, water, energy and CO2-eq economic productivity to evaluate the sustainability of wheat and rapeseed cultivation under two field management practices: 1) furrow irrigation with conventional tillage (FICT), and 2) center pivot irrigation with no-tillage (CPNT), within a semi-arid region in northeastern Iran. Irrigation in both systems was done by applying a deficit irrigation approach. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: CPNT resulted on average in 46% and 53% energy consumption reductions from water and diesel usage, respectively, compared to FICT. The mean CO2-eq emission under CPNT was 26% lower than that recorded under FICT. Furthermore, the WEFG nexus index score for wheat and rapeseed under CPNT was 0.91 and 0.73, respectively, out of 1, compared to 0.18 and 0.12 for FICT. These scores suggest that the CPNT approach is a more appropriate strategy than FICT, as it effectively reduced water and energy consumption while aligning better with long-term environmental and economic aims. SIGNIFICANCE: The study applies more accurate GHG emission-based indicators to introduce a new WEFG nexus index, and it uses these for evaluation of different field management at the farm level to reduce the uncertainties in the large-scale studies. The proposed methodology for assessing multiple aspects of the WEFG nexus can change previous perceptions about agricultural management in other regions confronting multiple resources and environmental crises.",

    "abstract": "The climate impact of meat production is a hotly debated topic. What is less often highlighted is that grazing ruminants can have positive impacts on biodiversity. The aim of this study was to use a life cycle perspective to assess both the climate and biodiversity impact of different beef and lamb production systems in Sweden. Applying a life cycle perspective, a quantitative method to assess biodiversity was used, with a scoring system based on land use. For the climate impact calculations, the ClimAg biophysical systems model was used, including emissions from drained organic soils and carbon sequestration in mineral soils. The functional unit was 1 kg carcass weight. The results indicated large differences in biodiversity and climate impact between the production systems studied. Dairy bulls had relative low emissions of greenhouse gases, but also a low biodiversity score (a high score indicates higher level of biodiversity). Beef breed steers and heifers had higher emissions of greenhouse gases but a higher biodiversity score, suggesting a trade-off between climate and biodiversity impact. Also for lamb meat, greenhouse gas emissions vary among production systems. A system with winter born lambs slaughtered in spring, closely followed by spring born lambs slaughtered in autumn, had the lowest emissions, while spring born lambs slaughtered in winter had the highest emissions. Winter lambs on the other hand, had a relatively high biodiversity score, due to a long rearing period and an extensive land use with a high proportion of semi-natural grasslands. Climate impact was in all systems related to methane from enteric fermentation, emissions from manure storage, and emissions from organic soils. With the assumptions made in this study, soil carbon sequestration is suggested to reduce the climate impact by 5–7% of the total emissions. Biodiversity impact was in all systems positively related to the amount of grazing in permanent grasslands, in particular semi-natural grasslands. Because semi-natural grasslands are among the most species rich terrestrial ecosystems in Europe, a large surface area grazed resulted in high biodiversity scores in the present model. This study used a novel approach for biodiversity assessment, where the positive contribution of semi-natural grasslands to biodiversity was quantified and put in relation to the modelled climate impact.",

    "abstract": "Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a conceptual framework for responding climate-related risk in agriculture across the three pillars of Mitigation, Resilience, and Production. Existing tools have been developed which seek to operationalise the CSA concept to evaluate and benchmark progress; each of which have their own relative strengths and weaknesses. The translation of this concept into actionable projects/portfolios hence requires the careful evaluation of potential trade-offs and synergies between these three pillars. The hereby presented decision-making tool aims to offer a basis for a structured evaluation of such trade-offs and synergies. It does so by assessing five different outcome pathways on how they contribute to a project's performance across the three pillars of CSA. We aspire that the use of this tool will allow for more deliberate design and implementation of projects in agricultural development, increasing the resilience and productivity of farming systems whilst ensuring the sustainable use of the environmental resource-based agriculture depends on. This tool was applied in a workshop setting to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of two distinct projects; demonstrating the utility in visualising the same performance in different ways. Of particular importance was ability to demonstrate how focusing on productivity and adaptation may trade-off mitigation activities. The results of the case study application demonstrated the challenge in meeting all the CSA requirements; particularly where the main objective of a project is to enhance and increase productivity. This reinforces how supporting all three pillars is challenging for a single project and therefore CSA is arguably more achievable when viewed in terms of a portfolio of activities which can collectively compensate for the limitations of a single project.",

    "abstract": "In several lower middle income countries, organic agriculture (OA) has emerged as a top-down government initiative backed by strong political interest, which entails the risk of seriously neglecting the challenges faced by many organic farmers. In some cases, the promotion of OA, particularly large-scale OA conversion programs like in Sikkim and Bhutan, has received widespread attention. A system-level analysis of conversion to OA can provide a fair assessment and is desirable but rare. Often, there are serious issues with data paucity hindering deeper analyses of the feasibility of large-scale OA and its system-level challenges. This article aims to analyze the feasibility of large-scale conversion to OA by describing management and farming practices, yield gaps, nutrient balances, as well as the governance and the institutional setting of OA in Bhutan. Bhutan is a suitable case study given the generally good availability of data on the agricultural sector. We conduct qualitative content analysis of annual, status, and consultation reports, and gray literature. We analyze the yield gap between organic and conventional farms using agricultural census data. A tentative aggregated nutrient balance at the district and organic village levels is also carried out relying on data from agricultural surveys and censuses and associated reports. OA in Bhutan requires compliance with the standard requirements defined in the Bhutan Organic Standard (BOS), which is part of the family of standards established by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). Farmers are increasingly opting for certified organic farming, with 6% and 3% of arable land being registered and certified, respectively, under the local organic assurance system (LOAS). The National Center for Organic Agriculture (NCOA) has instituted model organic villages (MOVs) and provides capacity building training and in-kind farm support to organic farmers. The results of the yield gap analysis show that yields in organic systems are between 18% to 45% lower across the three main agro-ecological zones compared to conventional cropping systems. This could exacerbate the country's food self-sufficiency. The results of the nutrient balance reveal a general nitrogen deficiency which could be mitigated with improved OA practices. OA faces many challenges, such as a shortage of funds for implementing organic programs, missing extension for OA, and a lack of research to improve the existing methods. This paper provides clarity on the challenges faced by farmers under state-driven large-scale OA conversion. Understanding the challenges of converting to OA in Bhutan can lead to transferable findings for many similar contexts characterized by smallholder farming systems.",

    "abstract": "In the Seine Basin, characterized by intensive arable crops, most surface and groundwater is contaminated by nitrate (NO3−). A collaborative study was set up, involving a network of volunteer farmers, to investigate NO3− leaching with ceramic cups (90 cm deep) on whole crop rotations of organic (OF) and conventional (CF) commercial farms in the Seine Basin. A total of eight CF and six OF systems were studied (63 fields) in five different soil and climate conditions, taking into account a wide diversity of practices (including low or no exogenous N inputs, systematic catch-crop implementation, and no tillage) and use of different exogenous organic matter (EOM) such as biogas residue; slurry; poultry manure; and cow and horse manure. Over the 2 years, OF cropping systems (including alfalfa) led to a lower average sub-root concentration (37 ± 9 mg NO3− l− 1) than CF systems (48 ± 19 mg NO3− l− 1, ± standard deviation between farms). The water inflows calculated ranged from 86 to 190 mm depending on the year for the 4-month drainage period. The amounts of N leached were on average 23% lower in OF (12.5 ± 2.9 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) than in CF systems (16.2 ± 6.3 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1). Concerning farming practices, the main impacting factors were the use of EOM in fall, the lack of catch crops before spring, and the proportion of legumes in the rotation. Overall, this wide collaborative network highlights good and innovative practices by CF and OF farmers attempting to decrease NO3− in groundwater.",

    "abstract": "This study combined bottom-up and top-down approaches to assess the ex-ante effects of conservation agriculture (CA)-based systems in Zambia considering both biophysical and economic factors and prevailing farm systems characteristics. For continuous maize cropping we compared a CA-based system of no-tillage with crop residue retention to a control system of conventional tillage with crop residue removal. First, we simulated yield effects that were calibrated and evaluated against multiple datasets, including on-farm agronomic trials from two seasons and six sites. Next, we extrapolated our simulations to all maize-growing areas in Zambia using gridded climate and soil datasets. Then simulated yields (in kg ha−1) were combined with economic data from a nationally-representative household survey to construct economic indicators including benefit-cost ratios (based on gross benefits and variable costs both in $ ha−1) that captured the implicit value of crop residues and labor demands. The field scale (per ha) indicators were scaled out using harvested areas as an expansion factor. All indicators were calculated over 3-, 10-, and 20-year simulation periods using an interpolated sequence of historical climate data. Finally, we conducted a spatial farm typology analysis to help understand the spatial variation in our field-scale indicators and provide insights into trade-offs and the suitability of CA-based systems for farmers. Average changes in yield from using CA-based systems (compared with the control) at the district scale ranged from −37% to 70% (average 33%), with a similar range of changes in benefit-cost ratios once economic factors were included, in addition to intra-district yield variability. Combining the changes in benefit-cost ratios with maize harvested area resulted in an average annual change in district-scale net benefit ranging from US $ − 3.9 to US $9.9 million (with an average of US $1.1 million). The heterogeneity in biophysical and economic factors gave a ranking of provinces different according to biophysical or economic indicators, reinforcing the importance of coupling biophysical and economic approaches. The spatial farm typology analysis highlighted the specific contexts of farmers relevant to the suitability of CA, such as their mineral fertilizer applications rates, ownership of livestock, and prevailing soil texture and rainfall.",

    "abstract": "Scaling up food security innovations in low-income rural environments has often failed to achieve substantive and lasting results. This poor performance can be attributed to dominant, linear approaches associated with spreading innovations which entail technology research and development and subsequent transfer to farmers. Such approaches tend to overlook complexity elements and non-linear processes in smallholder agriculture, including multiple stress factors such as climate variability and economic risks that make the uptake of new agricultural innovations more unpredictable. This article presents programmatic lessons from the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF) on scaling up. It considers projects that: i) deployed successfully pilot-tested innovations to reach and benefit large numbers of beneficiaries; and projects that ii) used innovations as an entry point to catalyse systematic change in the food and agricultural sector. The paper also outlines several key scaling up principles that can encourage better understanding of relevant socio-ecological dynamics and complexities in intervention areas as a way to support innovations (at scale) that can contribute to more sustainable system outcomes. Finally, the paper reflects on how predominant definitions of impact at scale, centered around rather narrow indicators around economic growth and technology transfer, might consider more holistic goals that encompass integrated agricultural interventions that advance sustainable agri-food system outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The Farmer Business School (FBS) is a participatory, action learning process focused on product and business development, and like the Farmer Field School, is a complex, multi-dimensional innovation with the potential to benefit large numbers of farming households economically, socially and institutionally. Scaling this approach requires rethinking both innovation and scaling. The paper draws on the insights of recent research which argues that a systems approach to innovation can better address the complexity of scaling processes and provides frameworks that link together processes of innovation and scaling. In examining these frameworks, the paper identifies the key role of partnership dynamics in those processes. Drawing on both the innovation and scaling literature and literature on partnership dynamics, a conceptual framework is developed to analyze how partnership dynamics contribute to and constrain the transition from small-scale 'niche' innovation testing led by researchers, to large scale integration of the approach by development partners in agricultural 'regimes'. Using case studies involving partnerships between a small international agricultural research grant recipient and six large development projects supported by IFAD multilateral loans and managed by government agencies undertaken in four Asian countries between 2011 and 2018, the study analyses the variable dynamics of the partnerships from initial networking to integrated collaboration, in the process of scaling the FBS innovation. Responding to the main research question about the drivers of partnership dynamics that contribute to scaling, the paper examines the partnerships in terms of six drivers which derived both from the literature and also from the empirical evidence presented in the study. The drivers include two dimensions of \"fit\", one about the convergence of research expertise and development demand, the other about the systematic integration of the innovation with different elements of the development actions. Other drivers relate to the issue of the convergence of project cycles, the stability of staffing in partner organizations, internal decision-making processes and the dimension of \"partnering\" – the value-based and behavioral aspects of collaboration. The paper also discusses the results of a \"partnership health check-up\" process conducted periodically during the partnerships and reconsiders the driver about system fit to understand the extent to which there had been a transformation in the conventional 'regime' approach to innovations and scaling. Finally, the paper proposes to adjust the conceptual framework based on the analysis of these partnerships for scaling innovations.",

    "abstract": "Meeting the growing food production needs of a society, while simultaneously maintaining or improving water quality, is a challenge facing many watersheds around the world. Across many nations, the agricultural norm is for farmers to dictate what, when and where to plant based on market demand and the most economically efficient use of land resources for the individual farm enterprise. As an alternative, the European Union (EU) has explored the potential of a soil-based, land use framework to achieve economic and environmental targets in agriculturally dominated watersheds; however, this framework has not been explored in the United States (US). We investigated the potential for an EU style soil-based, land use framework to improve water quality, while maintaining crop yields, in a sub-watershed of the Chesapeake Bay. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was utilized to model crop growth, and losses of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and sediment for an 8-year period (2010 - 2017). Based on SWAT model results, an algorithm was developed to spatially reallocate crop rotations within existing agricultural land to reduce TN, TP, and sediment losses based on soil properties while maintaining a similar production area of each rotation. Hay was reallocated onto landscapes most vulnerable to erosion and nutrient loss, whereas corn-soybean rotations were reallocated onto less vulnerable areas. In the reallocated scenario, 28% of agricultural lands retained the same crop rotation as the baseline scenario while 72% were reassigned. In a SWAT simulation of the reallocated scenario, TN, TP and sediment losses were reduced by 15%, 14% and 39%, respectively at an average annual scale. These results suggest that simply redistributing crop rotations within an impaired watershed can make significant water quality improvements even without additional structural best management practices. Although watershed-scale benefits were evaluated here, future research is needed to understand how this approach affects farm-level factors, as implementation may require some farmers to change the type of crops they grow.",

    "abstract": "Rapid assessments of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on the seed sector were conducted by a coalition of partners in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Uganda in May and June 2020. The method was rapid, iterative, inclusive and valuable in revealing threats to the availability and timely access of farmers to quality seed and to food, nutrition and income security, and in advocating for remedial and preventative action. Via mobile application and web survey, and focus group discussions on virtual conferencing platforms a panel of 36 or more local experts operating particularly in formal seed systems in each country identified potential disruptions to activities in the seed sector and recommended immediate practical action to ensure continuity in performance. Recommendations, and the stakeholders best positioned to propel their action, were proposed to and approved by senior leadership in the sector. The entire process from survey to publication of a seed alert in each iteration was completed within two weeks. Due to the highly seasonal nature of agriculture, and recognition that activities are time-bound, quick turnaround on assessments was essential. Dashboards indicated where impact was felt the hardest, also showing how dynamic the situation was. Countries were at different stages in their agricultural seasons, which made the data highly contextual, but also interesting for getting a glimpse into the future. Lessons were offered from one country to another. Reduced mobility was the root cause of many disruptions in supplying seed to farmers. Disruptions caused seed and related industry to operate at reduced capacity. The cost of transactions and doing business during these times may have increased the scarcity and price of inputs beyond what farmers can recover. Sales of quality seed in formal markets were perceived to decline due to delays in distribution, weakened promotion efforts and fewer farmers present. Farmers are less likely to benefit from investments in crop improvement for more seasons to come due to delays in the development and release of new varieties. Social distancing prevents stakeholders from meeting to exchange goods, services and information, but the sector is gradually getting up to speed with information technology. For all concerns, practical options were offered and often implemented. The pandemic has exacerbated structural weaknesses in the organization of the seed sector, for which reforms are not only justified, but overdue.",

    "abstract": "Farming in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is historically dominated by small-scale farms (SSFs), but evidence suggests that medium-scale farms (MSFs) are becoming increasingly prominent. These MSFs are often portrayed as entrepreneurial innovators, bringing dynamism and commercialization to SSA agriculture without displaying the negative features of land grabbing processes. However, there is little empirical evidence supporting these claims. We deployed a survey of 319 farmers covering a wide range of sizes in the Kenyan Rift Valley. Results show that MSFs are not a new phenomenon in the area, and are mostly farms that incrementally increased in size by buying or renting additional land. Furthermore, we find no differences in yields for various crop types between SSFs and MSFs. On average, MSFs use a higher share of their land for grazing, and have more dairy cattle per farm but less per hectare. The average MSF has a higher propensity to grow cash crops and serve non-local markets than the average SSF, and they employ significantly fewer people per hectare. However, within-category heterogeneity is high for all investigated dimensions, while past decision-making and future aspirations reveal entrepreneurship to occur in all farm size categories. We conclude that only a subset of all MSFs can be characterized as entrepreneurial, while these qualities can also be attached to many SSFs. Hence, we find that farm scale is an imperfect proxy to gauge the characteristics of a farm system, and presenting MSFs as a developmental panacea for SSA's rural areas is therefore unwarranted.",

    "abstract": "There is growing recognition that food systems must adapt to become more sustainable and equitable. Consequently, in developing country contexts, there is increasing momentum away from traditional producer-facing value chain upgrades towards efforts to increase both the availability and affordability of nutritious foods at the consumer level. However, such goals must navigate the inherent complexities of agricultural value chains, which involve multiple interactions, feedbacks and unintended consequences, including important but often surprising trade-offs between producers and consumers. Based around the 'Loop' horticultural aggregation scheme of Digital Green in Bihar, India, we develop a system dynamics modelling framework to survey the value chain trade-offs emerging from upgrades that aim to improve the availability of fruits and vegetables in small retail-oriented markets. We model the processes of horticultural production, aggregation, marketing, and retailing – searching for futures that are 'win-win-win' for: (i) the availability of fruits and vegetables in small retail markets, (ii) the profits of farmers participating in aggregation, and (iii) the sustainability of the initial scheme for Digital Green as an organisation. We simulate two internal upgrades to aggregation and two upgrades to the wider enabling environment through a series of 5000 Monte Carlo trajectories – designed to explore the plausible future dynamics of the three outcome dimensions relative to the baseline. We find that 'win-win-win' futures cannot be achieved by internal changes to the aggregation scheme alone, emerging under a narrow range of scenarios that boost supplies to the small retail market whilst simultaneously supporting the financial takeaways of farmers. In contrast, undesirable producer versus consumer trade-offs emerge as unintended consequences of scaling-up aggregation and the introduction of market-based cold storage. This approach furthers ongoing efforts to capture complex value chain processes, outcomes and upgrades within system dynamics modelling frameworks, before scanning the horizon of plausible external scenarios, internal dynamics and unintended trade-offs to identify 'win-win-win' futures for all.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable intensification is one approach to increasing food production without undermining sustainability goals. In recent years new tools and indicators have been developed for broad-based assessment of sustainable intensification. However, most of these tools have been applied at field level and assessing individual technologies, while integrated assessments of multiple novel practices at farm-to-village level are lacking. In this study we develop and apply a data collection, analysis, and interpretation approach that results in a replicable and rapid method for a multi-variate assessment of sustainable intensification. Drawing on a survey of 779 participant farmers, and using the Sustainable Intensification Assessment Framework, we quantified 27 indicators grouped into five domains: agricultural production, economics, environment, human welfare, and social. We applied an expert-led threshold setting exercise to re-scale indicators, permitting aggregated and dis-aggregated visualisation onto a common axis. We developed a graphic evaluation approach to communicate the multiple domain and indicator scores and applied this approach to quantify trade-offs and synergies related to agricultural productivity in four contrasting sites in Ethiopia. In each site there was a notable and significant gradient of production intensity, although average crop and livestock productivity remained well below attainable levels. Higher levels of productivity were correlated with higher scores in the economic, social and agricultural domains, and in some sites they were also positively correlated with the human welfare and environmental domains. In no case was increased production intensity correlated with lower scores in any of the sustainability domains, indicating that in these relatively low-intensity systems increases in productivity will go hand-in-hand with improvements in most other sustainability domains. Synergies can overrule trade-offs in these smallholder systems in Ethiopia, if managed well. This is one of very few studies of multiple sustainable intensification technologies implemented concurrently at the household to community level. Most studies focus on individual technologies or practices within specific niches of the farming system. The method could be developed further for efficient application to various large-scale development or intensification projects, and could potentially make use of existing smallholder information databases. An assessment of sustainable intensification in one district (woreda) of central Ethiopia. The boxplot in the upper left of the figure shows the condition of five “sustainability domains”, which are: agricultural production, economic, environment, human welfare, and social. The point plot in the upper right of the figure shows the median and inter-quartile range of each of the indicators monitored. The indicators used are listed on the right hand side of the figure. The table in the lower part of the figure provides framework for prioritisation of issues, whereby indicators with worse overall status may be considered more urgent, and indicators with low variation within the site may be considered more challenging to influence. • A five-year program promoting multiple concurrent sustainable intensification technologies was assessed. • Farm productivity was correlated to improvements in the other sustainability domains, indicating a lack of trade-offs. • Synergies due to the initially low productivity, the wide range of technologies, and the meaningful farmer participation. • Crop and livestock productivity was still below attainable levels, and progress was not uniform amongst participants. • The method presented here is suitable to monitor the transition towards sustainable intensification in portfolio programs.",

    "abstract": "Ruminant livestock make an important contribution to global food security by converting feed that is unsuitable for human consumption into high value food protein, demand for which is currently increasing at an unprecedented rate because of increasing global population and income levels. Factors affecting production efficiency, product quality, and consumer acceptability, such as animal fertility, health and welfare, will ultimately define the sustainability of ruminant production systems. These more complex systems can be developed and analysed by using models that can predict system responses to environment and management.We present a framework that dynamically models, using a process-based and mechanistic approach, animal and grass growth, nutrient cycling and water redistribution in a soil profile taking into account the effects of animal genotype, climate, feed quality and quantity on livestock production, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and quality, and nutrient cycling in a grazing system.A component to estimate ruminant animal growth was developed and integrated with the existing components of the SPACSYS model. Intake of herbage and/or concentrates and partitioning of the energy and protein contained in consumed herbage and/or concentrates were simulated in the component. Simulated animal growth was validated using liveweight data from over 200 finishing beef cattle and 900 lambs collected from the North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP) in southwest England, UK, between 2011 and 2018. Annual nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia, methane and carbon dioxide emissions from individual fields were simulated based on previous validated parameters.A series of statistical indicators demonstrated that the model could simulate liveweight gain of beef cattle and lamb. Simulated nitrogen (N) cycling estimated N input of 190 to 260 kg ha-1, of which 37-61% was removed from the fields either as silage or animal intake, 15-26% was lost through surface runoff or lateral drainage and 1.14% was emitted to the atmosphere as N2O. About 13% of the manure N applied to the NWFP and excreta N deposited at grazing was lost via ammonia volatilisation.The extended model has the potential to investigate the responses of the system on and consequences of a range of agronomic management and grazing strategies. However, modelling of multi-species swards needs to be validated including the dynamics of individual species in the swards, preferential selection by grazing animals and the impact on animal growth and nutrient flows.",

    "abstract": "Organic farming is an alternative for conventional farming practices with the potential to decrease negative externalities. Yet, in the Netherlands there has been a mismatch between societal preferences and farmer behaviour: despite increasing demand for organic pork meat, farmers feel peer pressure to remain conventional. Therefore, to understand diffusion of organic farming, one needs to consider social dynamics between farmers. The aim of this research is to gain insight in the factors contributing to the diffusion of organic farming, by considering social interaction mechanisms, market price dynamics, and heterogeneity in farming styles. We built an agent-based model of pig farmers differing in farm size and farming style (idealists, craftsmen and entrepreneurs) in a social-spatial network. They can convert from conventional to organic farming and back. Farmers can influence one another when they interact. This social influence is based on the social identity approach: Farmers who are similar in, among others, farming style converge in attitudes, while dissimilar farmers diverge in attitudes. The conventional meat price is volatile. The organic meat price fluctuates in accordance with supply. An exploratory analysis was performed on social influence parameters. Three social influence scenarios on the likelihood for influence in interaction were selected for local sensitivity analysis. The model run replicated 15 years and started with 16 organic farmers and 1958 conventional farmers. Model results were discussed with Dutch organic pork sector experts. The results of the exploratory analysis are threefold. An increase in the likelihood of influence in interaction increases the number of organic farmers from 44 to 121 and diversifies the organic farmers from 98% idealists to 31% idealists, 49% craftsmen and 20% entrepreneurs. The most influential factor on diffusion of organic farming is the demand for organic pork meat. New entrants stimulate organic farming through a different farming style than their predecessor. Expert discussion on model results confirmed the importance of consumer demand and new entrants for understanding diffusion. The social identity approach serves as a helpful framework to capture empirical and sociological knowledge. It reveals that farming styles of entrants contribute to the diversification of farming practices overall. For researchers and policy makers wishing to stimulate alternative farming practices, it is of interest to better understand this mechanism. In addition, we showed that those wishing to understand innovation in farming practices should look beyond farmer decision-making, by including market dynamics through consumer demand.",

    "abstract": "Weather is a pivotal factor for crop production as it is highly volatile and can hardly be controlled by farm management practices. Since there is a tendency towards increased weather extremes in the future, understanding weather-related yield factors becomes increasingly important not only for yield prediction, but also for the design of insurance products. Although insurance products mitigate financial losses for farmers, they suffer from considerable basis risk, i.e., a discrepancy between losses and the indemnity payment. The objective of this paper was to explore the potential of machine learning for estimating the relationship between crop yield and weather conditions at the farm level and to use it as a tool for reducing basis risk in index insurance applications. An artificial neural network was set up and calibrated to a rich set of farm-level yield data in Germany, covering the period from 2003 to 2018. A nonlinear regression model, which uses rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture as explanatory variables for yield deviations, served as a benchmark. The empirical application revealed that compared with traditional estimation approaches, the gain in forecasting precision by using machine learning techniques was substantial. Moreover, the use of regionalized models and disaggregated high-resolution weather data improved the performance of artificial neural networks. A considerable part of yield variability at the farm level, however, could not be captured by statistical methods which solely use \"big weather data\". Our findings have important implications for the design of weather-index based insurance because they document that a rather high level of basis risk remains if insurance products are based on an estimation of the weather-yield relationship.",

    "abstract": "Farm numbers are steadily declining in Europe and globally while farms become larger and more intensive. Driven in part by worsening macroeconomic conditions, these structural changes and the associated rationalization of agricultural supply chains have affected social relations in rural areas. In turn, farmers' social contacts influence farming decisions. Social and structural changes are thus interconnected, and they affect the resilience of rural areas through their influence on environmental, social, and economic capital. We examine the connection between farm structures and farmers' social contacts in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch (UBE), a mountain region in central Switzerland with a strong presence of family farms, and explore the implications of social and structural change for rural resilience. We conduct a survey of N = 102 farming households and combine it with farm-level agricultural census data and interviews with key stakeholders (N = 13) to analyze farmers' current social contacts and their changes since the year 2000. We use regression and cluster analyses to examine the relationship between (changes in) social contacts and farm-level characteristics. Farmers in the UBE have a high, but decreasing frequency of contacts with family, friends, and colleagues and lower, but increasing frequency of commercial and administrative contacts. Workloads have increased by 6% in five years, driven by farm-level expansion of agricultural area (+5%)—including expanding ecological compensation areas—and intensification in managed areas (+3%), leading to parallel processes of intensification and extensification. Since most of these family farms do not hire workers, growing workloads directly impinge on farmers' free time, affecting informal contacts most. Farm managers in larger and more intensive farms have more frequent and more diverse, but also more rapidly declining, social contacts. Our results point to a net loss in social capital as social contacts become less frequent and shift from local and informal to regional and national professional contacts. A 17% decline in farm numbers in 15 years reflects the vulnerability of farms in this region. Growing financial strain, workloads, time pressure and the associated erosion of informal contacts contribute to this vulnerability. Policymakers from local to national should recognize the contribution of farmers' diverse social networks towards rural resilience and seek options to maintain and enhance such networks. Beyond direct interventions that foster social capital, policymakers should more rigorously consider the short- and long-term interconnections and tradeoffs between different forms of capital.",

    "abstract": "Drivers of change in farming systems are not static, they evolve. Yet, there is an underlying assumption in the literature that drivers of change are static. This paper seeks to understand how drivers of change in Ghana's backyard poultry farming system evolve within a calendar year and examine how different production strategies contribute to the incomes of farm households. A system dynamics model, comprising production, financial, consumption, and epidemiological modules, was developed, validated, and simulated for a 52-week period using a weekly timestep. Results of the loops that matter analysis showed that from the onset of the poultry production, disease prevention at different growth stages of the chicken (especially for day-old chicks) via vaccination is a critical driver of change that has a high but short-lived dominance. Beyond the grower stage, the changes in the unit price of eggs have a relatively higher and longer influence on production dynamics than changes in the unit price of poultry meat. Moreover, the results suggest that a focus only on meat production is the most profitable strategy compared to production strategies that focus only on egg production or a mix of egg and meat production. The findings of this paper extend the literature on drivers of change in the farming system by stressing the need to assess how these drivers evolve. The application of the loops that matter analysis in system dynamics modelling provides a framework for analysing the evolution of drivers of change in farming system.",

    "abstract": "The ancient irrigation systems in Sri Lanka, known as village tank cascade systems, were developed to ensure an adequate and sustainable supply of good quality water to communities. However, there is growing concern about health and environmental issues related to the degradation of water quality caused by excessive nitrogen (N) levels from the overuse of chemical fertilizer. Subsidies for chemical fertilizer have encouraged fertilizer use for rice production in Sri Lanka. The objective was to evaluate the use of N fertilizers for rice production in the Thirappane cascaded tank system and its impact on nitrate water quality. An optimal rate of N use was determined based on private (farm-level) decisions on fertilizer use. However, the private optimal fertilizer rate is not adequate for overall social welfare due to market failures such as incomplete information and the lack of a market to account for the negative impact of fertilizer use on tank water quality. The hypothesis is that the social optimal fertilizer rate is lower than the private optimal rate due to this discrepancy. The study aims to identify the sources of inefficiency in the sub-optimal use of fertilizers from a social perspective. We developed an integrated crop, hydro-nutrient and economic model to analyze fertilizer decisions in the rice production process. The method involved conducting a marginal economic analysis based on simulated yield responses to N fertilizer and prices for inputs and outputs. The analysis was performed for three soil types across the Maha (rainy) and Yala (dry) seasons and for three different weather scenarios within each season. When the negative impact of nitrate contamination on water quality is taken into account, the optimal N fertilizer rate from a social perspective is always lower than the optimal rate determined solely by private economic considerations. These optimal rates varied based on factors such as soil type, season, weather conditions during the growing season, and fertilizer prices. At unregulated, higher, fertilizer prices, the crop yields achieved at the social optimum were only slightly lower than those achieved under the private economic optimum. However, under regulated, lower, fertilizer prices, achieving the social optimum would require a larger reduction in N fertilizer use and result in a greater decrease in crop yields. A systematic analysis that takes into account the social costs can serve as a guide for creating effective policies aimed at enhancing fertilizer decision making.",

    "abstract": "Livestock farming systems have received particular attention in the news and scientific media. However, do these considerations ever come to a real debate? Nothing is less certain. There is much attention on the negative impacts of livestock farming on the environment, and it remains difficult to have a fruitful dialogue on the desirable developments of livestock farming areas. This is also true at a local scale, where antagonisms among stakeholders can be strong. We present La Grange®, a generic serious game that reveals trade-offs and synergies in livestock farming areas. Its aim is to promote horizontal knowledge and dialogue among stakeholders on locally-adapted transition for livestock farming. After presenting the conceptual model underlying the game with the different game components and phases, we report the outputs of four case studies with groups of farmers or students in agriculture. We show that La Grange® fills a gap in the toolbox for understanding livestock farming, making it possible to integrate generic and local knowledge and incorporating its biotechnical, environmental, economic, and sociocultural dimensions. In each case study, La Grange® not only revealed trade-offs and synergies between these dimensions, but also allowed new cooperation and strategic roadmaps to be set up for a livestock farming area. Both farmers and students perceived the game as a less top-down way of learning. When played with citizens, two of them joined the steering committee on an experimental farm after the game session. As a low-tech, easy-to-access game, La Grange® can be easily used by extension services and agricultural teachers. Outputs from the four case-studies makes it possible to classify La Grange® as a \"Game for Change\" due to its impact on supporting sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Continued increases in global population and rising living standards in many countries are driving a surge in demand for energy and protein-rich foods. Wheat, barley, and canola are important crops that are grown and traded globally. However, climate change, geopolitical tensions and competition from other crops threaten the ability to satisfy global demand. Accurate predictions of crop production and its spatial variation can play a significant role in their reliable and efficient production, marketing, and distribution. This review examined recently published models and data used to predict wheat, barley, and canola yield to identify which factors produced the best yield predictions. A literature search was conducted across the Scopus, EBSCOhost and Web of Science databases over seven years between 2015 and 2021. Data extracted from the papers identified by the literature search were investigated using graphical and quantitative analytical techniques to determine if the type of algorithm, input data, prediction timing, output scale or extent and climate variability both in isolation and in combination affected the model's predictive ability. The literature search produced 11,908 results which was reduced to 118 papers after applying the review criteria (peer reviewed papers focussed on models predicting yield at greater than plot scale across extensive areas using accessible data). China produced almost one third of all yield prediction models over the study period and 87% of models were used to predict wheat yield. Statistical models were the most common algorithm in most regions and in total. However, there was a surge in machine learning models after 2018. They were the most common model from 2019 to 2021, with one third developed in China. The review concluded that only the choice of modelling technique and the input data had a significant effect on model performance with the machine learning techniques Random Forest, Boosting algorithms and Deep Learning models as well as process-based Light Use Efficiency models that used a combination of remotely sensed and agrometeorological data performing best. The review showed that matching the model to the available data could improve the ability to predict wheat, barley or canola yield. The use of quantitative statistical techniques in this review, should give modellers trying to predict wheat, barley or canola yield more confidence in matching their approach to the available data than previous reviews that relied on visual interpretation of data.",

    "abstract": "Intensive pig farming is challenged by high environmental impacts and dependence on outsourced inputs. Circular feeding strategies to improve nutrient cycling and livestock diversity have emerged as pathways to improve the sustainability. This study explored the potential of increasing feed circularity and introducing sheep to improve the sustainability of a typical pig fattening region in the semiarid zone of Spain. Three alternative circular scenarios were designed to relocate pig feed production while reintroducing sheep production. These scenarios were then compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. The feeding strategies scenarios differed in crude protein (CP) and in-feed amino acid (AA) supplementation for pigs (CircHigh, high CP with low AA; CircLow, low CP with high AA; CircNoAA, low CP without AA) and included grazing sheep to use crop residues, alfalfa and temporary vetch-oat pastures on fallow land. Yearly feed requirements for pigs were planned, and were met with cereal grains, oilseeds, legumes, rice bran and chopped alfalfa hay. Sheep carrying capacity was estimated from available forage sources. Indicators in five sustainability dimensions were considered: economic performance, landscape mosaic, livestock diversity, nitrogen (N) cycling, and feed-food competition. Outsourced (BAU) pig feeding without sheep had low scores for indicators in all five dimensions. The feeding strategy for pigs strongly influenced the land area required to produce feed as well as N cycling. Only the CircLow scenario could feed the current pig stocks in the region with the arable land available. The CircHigh strategy combined with grazing sheep scored highest for most of the dimensions, except for feed-food competition indicators. The CircLow strategy had good scores for most of the dimensions, except for N cycling indicators, whose scores decreased due to the lower N content of slurry. The CircNoAA strategy increased the use of rice bran as a food coproduct and decreased N surplus, but also impaired the economic performance (land productivity and feeding costs). Although the CircLow strategy required less land area to grow legumes, it resulted in a slightly higher crop diversity and a higher sheep carrying capacity when sowing temporary pastures. N cycling and overall sustainability of regions with intensive livestock production was improved through feed circularity, that included reducing CP with high in-feed AA, and livestock diversity, by reintroducing sheep as complementary livestock that can graze crop residues and temporary pastures. These results may help to inform future rural policies to help upscale more sustainable practices in intensive pig farming regions.",

    "abstract": "Pesticide-free but non-organic production systems have been recently introduced in public and private programs in Europe. However, a key challenge is to define what 'pesticide-free' comprises and means. This paper aims to give insights in and critical reflections on the definition and regulation of pesticide-free crop production systems in real-world programs. To this end, we review four examples of public and private pesticide-free production programs in European crop production (i.e. from France, Germany and Switzerland). Our analysis reveals several semantic and regulatory inconsistencies and potential confusion that exists around the term pesticide-free crop production, i.e. we find that it is far from clear-cut what pesticide-free production systems are. For example, programs differ with respect to which part of the crop management cycle is regulated. Moreover, all programs offer various exceptions for pesticide use. Definitions and regulations differ widely across case studies. For example, to participate in governmental programs on pesticide-free production farmers in one country have different requirements than in another. Moreover, governmental regulations not match with those in private programs and vice versa. Pesticide-free production programs can be a useful and viable addition to European agricultural and food systems. However, based on the here presented insights, we formulate eight recommendations for policy and industry how to clarify, align and harmonize pesticide-free crop production.",

Our objective is to analyse the structure, functions and directionality of the Swedish wild berry innovation system and draw implications for ongoing efforts to develop the value chain. Our study is based on 18 semi-structured interviews, participant observations and a range of secondary sources. We use an analytical framework based on the agricultural innovation systems approach and pay specific attention to reflexivity, directionality and non-human materiality. The Swedish wild berry innovation system is fragmented as incumbent berry companies are absent from efforts to develop and reconfigure the value chain. The fragmentation is a result of the partly conflicting objectives among actors in the innovation system. There is a need for broader governance networks to navigate trade-offs and enable the commercialisation of new solutions. Successful innovation likely hinges on institutional change, particularly when it comes to efforts to improve labour conditions for migrant workers. Our study contributes empirically to research on non-timber forest product value chains and offers insights for actors pursuing innovation related to Swedish wild berries. We contribute to theoretical development in the agricultural innovation systems literature by incorporating attention reflexivity, directionality and non-human materiality.",

    "abstract": "African agriculture, and especially market vegetables production, which is dominated by smallholder systems, generally faces many challenges. There is growing interest in agroecology as a means to move towards more sustainable food and farming systems. The West African region is considered by FAO to feature the conditions to become \"a global frontrunner in agroecology\", and ongoing efforts in Côte d'Ivoire attempts to understand and promote agroecology in vegetable production. The objective of this study is to present a functional analysis of the Ivorian suburban market vegetables value chain, and discuss the suitability of and agroecological transition of the agricultural production link, towards more sustainable vegetables production in the country. A thorough functional analysis of the Ivorian market vegetables value chain was conducted, including the construction of typologies to identify the links between agroecological practices and overall technical and socio-economic efficiencies. The available data (primary, secondary) allows but only a superficial understanding of the Ivorian market vegetables value chain. The analysis of economic returns as a function of their adoption of agroecological practices suggests that \"formal\" agroecological farms struggle economically, more so than the rest of producers. Observed relations between yields and certain agroecological practices practiced by most Ivorian producers, in combination with the functional analysis of the value chain, suggest that an intensification of these practices, coupled with improvements of the enabling environment (necessary to palliate the inputs cost and product price variability, as well as improve and secure access to land), may overall contribute to improved yields and higher gross margins. More and more detailed studies are necessary to determine the agroecological practices and their level of adoption that would minimise negative environmental and maximise positive socio-economic impacts. In Côte d'Ivoire, agroecology must prove its worth, through action-research initiatives, in order to further develop in terms of breadth and depth of application. this article includes a national functional analysis of vegetable production systems. This is useful for understanding value chains and facilitating agroecological transition.",

    "abstract": "Institutional change strategies that prioritize transparency, fairness, and respect will advance inclusive agri-food systems innovation. This short communication posits that institutional change strategies are a linchpin, necessary for International Agricultural Research Centers to implement models promoting inclusive agri-food systems innovation. Models promoting inclusive innovation are pivotal for generating and advancing research for development actions tailored to specific contexts. Context-specific approaches demonstrate superior adaptability compared to universal actions. They contribute to the effectiveness of agriculture research for development, particularly in times of increasing volatility and inadequate progress toward global sustainability and equity goals. Targeted institutional change strategies foster three sister strategies that bolster inclusive innovation: navigating trade-offs; enhancing partnerships; and diversifying measurement. The paper stems from consultations within the Independent Science for Development Council (ISDC) and ISDC's related advising to CGIAR.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Worldwide greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reached 59 Gt of CO2eq in 2019 and agricultural soils are the primary source of N2O emissions. Life cycle assessments (LCA) have been successful in assessing GHG from agricultural systems. However, no review and harmonization attempt has been focused on soil N2O emissions, despite the need to improve LCA methodologies for assessing GHG in agricultural LCA. OBJECTIVE: We therefore undertook a review and harmonization of existing methods to account for soil N2O emissions in LCA of agricultural systems and products: i) to compare current methods used in LCA; ii) to identify advantages and iii) disadvantages of each method in LCA; iv) to suggest recommendations for LCA of agricultural systems; v) to identify research needs and potential methodological developments to account for soil N2O emissions in the LCA of agricultural systems. In this paper, we consider as soil N2O emissions, those originated from soils in relation to fertilisers (organic and manufactured), crop residues, land use/land management change, grassland management, manure and slurry applications and from grazing animals. METHODS: The approach adopted was based on two anonymous expert surveys and a series of expert workshops (n = 21) to define general and specific criteria to review LCA methods for GHG emissions used in LCA of agricultural systems. A broad list of keywords and search criteria was used as the research involved GHG assessment in agricultural LCA. Reviewed papers and methodology were then assessed by LCA and soil N2O emission experts (n = 14). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: >25,000 scientific papers and reports were identified, 1175 were screened, 263 included in the final review and 31 scientific papers were related to soil N2O emissions. The results showed that a high level of accuracy corresponded to a low level of applicability and vice versa, following the assessment framework developed in this work through participatory approaches. SIGNIFICANCE: The choice of LCA methods, critical for high quality LCA of agricultural systems, should be based on the assessment objectives, data availability and expertise of the LCA practitioner. However, it is preferable to use DNDC model after calibration and validation or direct field measurements, considering system effects. When necessary data are lacking, IPCC tier 2 methodology where available should be used, otherwise 2019 IPCC Tier 1 methodology. This LCA method development should be synchronous with improvements of quantification methods and the assessment of a wider range of agricultural management practices and systems.",

    "abstract": "Farm size is a key indicator associated with environmental, economic, and social contexts and outcomes of agriculture. Farm size data is typically obtained from agricultural censuses or household surveys, but both are usually only available in infrequent time intervals and at aggregate spatial scales. In contrast, spatially explicit and detailed data on individual fields can be accessed from cadastral information systems or agricultural subsidy applications in some regions or can be derived from Earth observation data. Empirically exploring the field-size-to-farm size relationship (FFR) is a lever to enhance our understanding of spatial patterns of farm sizes by assessing field sizes. However, our currently limited empirical knowledge does not allow for the characterization of the FFR over large spatial extents. We analyze the FFR using data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) for Germany. The IACS manages agricultural subsidy applications in the European Union; therefore, the data include spatial information on the extent of all fields and farms for which farmers have applied for subsidies. We developed a Bayesian multilevel model and a machine learning model to estimate farm size based on field size, controlling for contextual factors such as crop types, state boundaries, topography, and neighborhood effects. We found that farm size generally increased with field size for almost all federal states and crop type groups, but the FFR varied considerably in magnitude. Farm size predictions were accurate for medium-sized and large farms (50–7,000 ha, representing 66% of the data) with mean absolute percentage errors of 40–114%, but estimates for smaller farms had higher errors. To evaluate the relationship at the landscape level, we spatially aggregated the predictions into hexagons with a diameter of 15 km. This resulted in more accurate predictions (mean absolute percentage errors of 37%) than at the field level. Our study presents the first empirical insights into the FFR, opening future research directions towards producing spatially explicit farm size predictions at scale. Such information is key for monitoring scale transitions in agricultural systems, facilitating the design of timely and targeted interventions, and avoiding undesired outcomes of such processes.",

    "abstract": "Highly water-dependent agri-food systems are impacted by external shocks, revealing their vulnerabilities and stressing the need to transform them towards increased sustainability and resilience. Various disciplines and scholars highlight the role of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in addressing societal challenges while creating sustainable and resilient contexts. In steering transformative processes, participation is vital as a governance variable. However, motivating stakeholders' engagement with NbS uptake in decision-making requires evidence proving its potential to effectively address their direct and indirect environmental, societal, and economic concerns. This review systematically analyzed the potential of Citizen Science (CS) to overcome the barriers to NbS adoption and to drive stakeholders' attitudes towards sustainability. Focused on water as an essential for the agri-food system, 46 articles were systematically analyzed to examine water-related NbS, locate relevant drivers and barriers of NbS and ecosystem services, including associated advantages and disadvantages. Current research focuses heavily on NbS that benefit people, often overlooking the broader environmental benefits. While a trend towards using NbS for extreme weather events is evident, other critical areas like irrigation, groundwater management, food security, and water sanitation (WASH) need more attention. These elements are vital for sustainable and resilient agri-food systems. The literature identifies three central challenges to implementing NbS: knowledge gaps, participation, and funding. Novel participatory research methods like CS could prove pivotal in addressing NbS adoption barriers. CS in NbS can enhance engagement through improved and informed stakeholder participation while ensuring cost-effective and transparent processes of monitoring and evaluating potential success. Although NbS are gaining traction, scopes and scales of implementation must be more inclusive of various stakeholders and ecological services for the broader environment. CS in NbS can promote sustainable attitudes within the individuals of the society, and by design, NbS provides a sustainable context. Upon proper alignment, CS-NbS can increase the harmony between human and natural systems, shedding light on the Resource Nexus cycle and ultimately causing a visible change in behavior within the engaged stakeholder network. This approach values and amplifies notions of inclusiveness and the incorporation of local knowledge. Living labs and mixed-method research in CS-NbS can initiate inter and transdisciplinarity, collaborative learning, knowledge sharing, and enhanced participation in decision-making while unlocking the transformative capacities of NbS and strengthening the science-policy-society interface.",

    "abstract": "Crop rotations are part of current agricultural practice, since they and their effects can contribute to a sustainable agricultural cropping system. However, in current Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, crop rotation effects are insufficiently considered, since these effects are difficult to measure. LCA studies from crop production typically take only one vegetation period into account. As a result, the consideration of how the assessed crop is influenced by the previous crop (crop rotation effects) including: (1) nutrient carryover, (2) reduction in operational requirements and (3) different intensity and timing of farming activities, is outside of the system boundary. However, ignoring these effects may lead to incorrect interpretation of LCA results and consequently to poor agricultural management as well as poor policy decisions. A new LCA tool called the \"Model for integrative Life Cycle Assessment in Agriculture (MiLA)\" is presented in this work. MiLA has been developed to assess GHG emissions and cumulative energy demands (CED) of cropping systems by taking the characteristics of crop cultivation in rotation into account. This tool enables the user to analyze cropping systems at farm level in order to identify GHG mitigation options and energy-efficient cropping systems. The tool was applied to a case study, including two crop rotations in two different regions in Germany with the goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of this tool on LCA results. Results show that including crop rotation effects can influence the GHG emission result of the individual crop by − 34% up to + 99% and the CED by − 16 up to + 89%. Expanding the system boundary by taking the whole crop rotation into account as well as providing the results based on different functional units improves LCA of energy crop production and helps those making the assessment to draw a more realistic picture of the interactions between crops while increasing the reliability of the LCA results.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the effects of various low-cost climate-smart agricultural (CSA) technologies on farm productivity, farm income and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in smallholder farming systems in southern Ethiopia. On-farm trials were conducted at three study sites/districts (Ziway, Halaba and Loka-Abaya) during the 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. The experiment compared five climate smart treatments against existing recommended practice. Three farms were selected at each site. Each farm hosted one full experimental repetition, thus functioning as an experimental block. The average data of the two seasons were taken from each farm and means were calculated per site and over the study sites as well. The on-farm trails were established to identify a CSA technology that can improve yields and economic returns, while simultaneously reduce GHG emissions at the farm level. Averaged over the three sites, a combined application of seed priming with micro-dosing (0.5 g of fertilizer per pocket) was identified as the best-fit technology in terms of farm productivity and farm income. Results show that this technology increased maize grain yield by up to 45% (compared to the recommended practice). A model CSA farm was then created using this technology which was compared with the performance of the farmers' current system (conventional farm). It generated surplus production of both grain (more than three times higher) and fodder. The CSA farm produced 84% of dry matter fodder (DM) requirements and 60% of livestock crude protein (CP) needs respectively, while the conventional farm produced 30% DM and 48% of CP needs. Furthermore, the CSA farm demonstrated reduced GHG emissions compared to the conventional farm which grows maize without the use of mineral fertilizers. Our estimates indicate that due to the establishment of multipurpose trees on the CSA farm, the total on-farm C stock was about 29 Mg ha−1, that is 24% higher than the conventional farm. In conclusion, we recommend the combined application of seed priming and micro-dosing as a strategy for improving economic returns and an approach to enhance the sustainability of maize-based mixed systems in southern Ethiopia. Planting multipurpose trees will give additional benefits in terms of fodder and carbon sequestration.",

In the face of new future institutional and climate challenges, there appears to be an urgent need for strategies to improve economic performance. This paper aims to evaluate the economic performance and risk of two alternative demand-oriented and productive efficiency strategies: i) protected geographical indication certification, and ii) increased ewe reproduction prolificacy. Based on regional farm records and price data and a survey of 54 local farmers, we formulated a stochastic gross margin model to simulate and analyze four strategic scenarios (baseline, quality labelling, productive efficiency, and joint strategies) under two specific stressors, namely decreased lamb prices and increased feeding costs. We found that feeding costs constitute the main risk factor, whereas price instability has less influence. Our findings highlight improvements in performance under a quality scenario, albeit with higher vulnerability to price variability with respect to the baseline scenario. In contrast, the productive efficiency scenario performs much better in terms of average gross margin and reduced vulnerability to feeding costs, albeit with a larger variation for the expected outcomes. The paper casts light on the vulnerability of the quality label under price risk, and suggests the potential for the joint implementation of both quality production and productive efficiency strategies, which could compensate for their respective weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "Climate change affects the timing and length of crop seasons. Adjusting sowing dates is a commonly recommended adaptation, but little is known about its efficacy in practice. This study investigated farm-level adjustments to sowing and harvesting dates (i.e., the growing period) in response to shifts in meteorological crop seasons during the last 30 years. Impacts on yields and farmers' complementary adaptation strategies were also examined. Using data from 287 farm households in four agroecological zones of the Indus Basin, Pakistan, we explored farmers' perceptions of shifts in seasons and adjustments in crop growing period. We verified these using meteorological station data on temperatures, precipitation and growing degree days. At lower altitudes (irrigated plains and mid-hills), the summer crop season had lengthened and the winter season shortened, but in both seasons the growing period was shorter, due to higher temperatures. The summer growing period was shorter by 5 (±11) days on the irrigated plains, while there was no significant change in length of the summer growing period in the mid-hills. The winter growing period was shorter by 15 (±6) days on both the plains and in the mid-hills, which negatively impacted yields. As an adaptation strategy, changing sowing dates was only somewhat effective in preventing yield losses. Farmers adopted complementary strategies, but these brought additional costs. At higher altitudes (valleys and mountains), the frost period had shortened, resulting in longer summer and winter crop seasons, and longer growing periods. The summer growing period was extended by 7 (±4) days in the valleys and 10 (±6) days in the mountains, while the winter growing period was extended by 3 (±3) days in the valleys and 13 (±5) days in the mountains, positively impacting yields. Farmers' adjustments in sowing dates did not necessarily parallel to seasonal shifts, as farm decision-making also had to consider risks linked to climate variability and management limitations. For the future, farmers at lower altitudes indicated limited further scope for adjusting sowing and harvesting dates. Our results contribute to a contextual understanding of farmers' responses to shifts in crop seasons. They indicate the need for adaptation planning to take advantage of extended growing periods in higher altitude zones, while supporting farmers in areas where seasonal shifts have negative impacts. Our findings furthermore indicate limits to adaptation in regions where agriculture is already challenged and provide suggestions for crop system-specific complementary measures.",

    "abstract": "The Swiss agri-environmental data network (SAEDN) encompasses farm management data, which are collected and processed annually to calculate indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions, potential biodiversity impact, or erosion risk. These indicators are yearly published in the framework of an agri-environmental monitoring programme and serve as decision support for policy makers and other stakeholders. Furthermore, the collected data are frequently used for research projects. This paper compares the SAEDN farms with the whole of Switzerland. It addresses the question of how appropriate the data collected are for monitoring purposes as well as research projects. The data collection procedure of the SAEDN is described in detail, including automated tests that improve the data quality. Furthermore, key figures of the SAEDN farms are analysed and compared with the whole of Switzerland in order to assess the significance of the farm network. The time-consuming data collection has resulted in a relatively small, non-random sample of Swiss farms (approx. 300 farms per year). The farms participating in the SAEDN represent the dominant agroecosystems of Switzerland reasonably well, while certain crop specialisations (viticulture and field vegetable production) and small ruminant husbandry are only marginally represented. The latter can partially be explained by an underrepresentation of farms located in southern Switzerland and in the mountains. Another problem is the continuously changing composition of the farm network. Thus, robust time series cannot be produced for all desired farm classifications (e.g. special crops). The collected data offer valuable insights into Swiss land use and farm management practices. To our knowledge, the presented dataset is the most comprehensive source of agronomic data in Switzerland covering many aspects such as complete crop rotations, field-specific fertilisation, and plant protection product use. The data thus provide an important basis for research projects, decisions in the political and legal context, and the development of a future monitoring system.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable geological macronutrient that plays an essential role in food security. The excessive use of P as a fertilizer and its subsequent diffuse loss leads to the deterioration of water quality, eutrophication, and loss of biodiversity. Ecosystem process-based models are a powerful tool to depict the P cycle, investigate the effects of management practices and climate change, and ultimately assess policy interventions that affect biogeochemical cycles. Of the limited number of P models in agricultural production systems, none have been tested in temperate conditions for periods of decades using long-term field experiments. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of the detailed P submodel from DayCent to: simulate the magnitude and temporal dynamics of P outputs; assess changes in P soil pools from European agricultural long-term experiments; and interpret the main causal factors inducing the differences between the observed vs. the simulated pools and fluxes. We used data from four long-term experiments to calibrate and test the P submodel of DayCent. The experiments involve five different soils, mineral and organic fertilizer treatments, management intensity levels, various crop rotations, crop residue management, and irrigation. The DayCent model captured the gross P budget (input minus output) in the four long-term experiments, and it performed well in simulating their soil total P (PTotal) over time. The model application simulated the soil available P (PAvailable) in the same range as the measured data, but the temporal dynamic did not always match the observed trends. P modelling is subject to a wide range of uncertainties with respect to both input data (particularly the unknown initial distribution of the different pool sizes of P and the uncertainty of the measurements) and the representation of processes influencing the P cycle that are not yet accounted for in the model. Despite these uncertainties and calls for further model assessment and developments, the results show that DayCent was capable of satisfactorily predicting the main P fluxes over time under a wide variety of management practices and European site conditions. The model may be used to assess different scenarios with a changing climate, a change in management or land-use, and to analyse potential feedback between the terrestrial and the climate system. This makes this model a promising tool for assessing policy and practical interventions.",

    "abstract": "Imperial Valley, California is called 'America's winter salad bowl' as the agricultural sector produces 2/3 of the winter vegetables eaten in the U.S. However, there is little understanding of the interplay of policy, environmental conditions, and economic components of the agricultural system producers face in the valley. Using a resilience approach, this study asks the research question of how producers in the Imperial Valley perceive and are adapting to changing conditions. Through interviews with eight agricultural producers, this paper identifies current challenges and strategies producers employ to navigate a changing agricultural system and build resilience for the future. Results highlight the critical role of government policies in the establishment of agriculture in the Valley, while producers see recent policies, such as labor and food safety regulations, as increasing their operation costs. Producers face economic challenges including losing contracts to Mexico, market price fluctuations, land leasing, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Maintaining access to water resources and investing in mechanization and technological innovations are two strategies producers use to maintain resilience and navigate change. Understanding how producers remain resilient given ongoing, and often accelerating, political, environmental, and economic change is critical to maintain agricultural systems in California and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Population pressure, land scarcity and encroachment of nature reserves are challenging sustainable intensification of agriculture in Uganda. One of the main staple crops in Uganda is East African Highland banana. Area expansion and improved management have enhanced the economic performance of banana, yet at the expense of food security, environmental and social sustainability. While a transition of banana-based farming systems to a more sustainable future seems necessary, the desired future state and pathways of getting there may differ among actors involved. Our study aimed to co-design potential transition pathways with stakeholders along the banana value chain in Uganda, and to assess the effects of these pathways on sustainability indicators at the household level. We conducted a participatory scenario analysis consisting of: 1) stakeholders envisioning and backcasting a sustainable future for two banana-based farming systems in Uganda; 2) researchers developing and quantifying plausible future scenarios to assess their effects on locally-relevant sustainability indicators at the household level; 3) stakeholders reflecting on the results, including synergies and trade-offs between sustainability indicators. Stakeholders' envisioned future combined with main trends influencing banana-based farming systems resulted in four contrasting scenarios: Marginalisation (stagnation compared with the reference baseline); Business as usual (extrapolation of historic trends); Intensification (including Integrated Soil Fertility Management and collective marketing of banana); and Transformation (irrigation in banana, balanced crop nutrient management, cooperatives, and increased farm sizes for some as other households leave agriculture). Compared with the current baseline situation, selected sustainability indicators food self-sufficiency and farm gross margins decreased in Marginalisation, but improved in all other scenarios. Soil nutrient balances were unfavourable in all scenarios, except with balanced crop nutrition in Transformation. Stakeholders recognised labour as a main trade-off for desired improvements in other sustainability domains. Stakeholders also reflected on benefits and risks of a continued specialisation in banana, and fiercely debated the desirability of mineral fertilizer use. The active involvement of stakeholders in providing the building blocks for the scenarios, identifying relevant indicators and reflecting on the results, aimed to guide stakeholders on concrete entry points for improving sustainability of the system. Indications of stakeholder commitment towards a more sustainable future included a convergence of ideas on the need for Integrated Soil Fertility Management, collaboration in cooperatives and the need for savings to overcome risks of specialising in banana. Meanwhile, higher-level advocacy and support is required in decision-making on more complex, long-term challenges.",

    "abstract": "To contribute to building sustainable and effective climate change adaptation solutions avoiding usability gap, it is largely recommended to engage in the process of co-production, integrating expertise and knowledge from various academic and non-academic actors. We want to learn if and how co-production, believed to effectively link knowledge and decision-making, and thus suggested as the best practice in building decision-support frameworks, is really applied in the frameworks that are being implemented on the ground. A literature review allowed us to identify integrated decision-support frameworks for climate-change adaptation in agriculture developed and used over the period of the last 10 years and involving non-academic stakeholders. To analyse them, we chose as an assessment tool the four co-production principles proposed by Norström and colleagues: context-based, pluralistic, goal-oriented and interactive. The useful entry points for incorporating co-production in the design of decision-support that we found in the reviewed frameworks include among the others adequate participants selection strategy, building on existing interaction spaces, developing a theory of change with the participants, and involving participants in the design of different elements of the method. The architectures of the analyzed frameworks contained more elements that responded to pluralistic and interactive principles than to context-based and goal oriented principles, we have also identified gaps in the design, such as taking into account the personal characteristics of researchers that could strengthen a framework's implementation and its impact, or attempts at bridging different levels of decision making, to cover the triad of science, policy and practice. A detailed look at the decision-frameworks that are actually being applied allows for a critical reflection whether and how we as researchers use what we preach as an effective way of responding to sustainability challenges in agriculture. Co-production principles turn out to be a useful tool for analysis and we suggest they can be used as a check-list when designing decision-support frameworks for climate-change adaptation. This papers offers useful examples of how to shift the research-led processes of decision-support towards more co-production with non-academic actors, to increase chances of bridging the gaps between science, policy and practice.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural sector generates a substantial proportion of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Changes to agricultural practices can provide GHG abatement by maintaining or increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in soils or vegetation, or by decreasing N2O emissions. However, it can be difficult to identify practices that achieve net abatement because practices that increase SOC stocks may also increase N2O emissions from the soil. This study simulated the net on-farm GHG abatement and gross margins for a range of management scenarios on two grain farms from the western and southern grain growing regions of Australia using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. The soils and practices selected for the study were typical of these regions. Increased cropping intensity consistently provided emissions reductions for all site-soil combinations. The practice of replacing uncropped or unmanaged pasture fallows with a winter legume crop was the only one of nine scenarios to decrease GHG emissions and increase gross margins relative to baseline practice at both locations over the 100-year simulation period. The greatest abatement was obtained by combining this practice with an additional summer legume crop grown for a short period as green manure. However, adding the summer legume decreased farm gross margins because the summer crop used soil moisture otherwise available to the following cash crop, thus reducing yield and revenue. Annual N2O emissions from the soil were an order of magnitude lower from sandy-well-drained soils at the Western Australian location (Dalwallinu) than at the other location (Wimmera) with clay soil, highlighting the importance of interactions between climate and soil properties in determining appropriate GHG abatement practices. Thus, greatest abatement at Dalwallinu was obtained from maintaining or increasing SOC, but managing both N2O emissions and SOC storage were important for providing abatement at Wimmera.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an evaluation framework followed to identify cost-efficient alternatives to extend the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), run by the European Commission Joint Research Centre since 1992, to other main producing areas of the world: Eastern European Neighbourhood, Asia, Australia, South America and North America. These new systems would follow the principles and components of the MCYFS Europe: a meteorological data infrastructure, a remote sensing data infrastructure, a crop modelling platform, statistical tools, a team of analysts and a crop area estimation component. The framework designed evaluates the performance of the possible MCYFS-like system realizations against six defined objectives and their costs. Possible monitoring systems are based on a combination of different technical solutions for each of the MCYFS components, and are evaluated through an automatic algorithm that calculates the expected system performance –relying on a priori expert judgement–, the costs, and possible risks to construct some technical solutions, to finally identify the cost-efficient ones. A baseline system, achieving the minimum required performance, was identified as the most efficient starting point for the MCYFS extension in all the geographical areas. Such system would be built upon: (i) near real-time reanalysis meteorological products; (ii) remote sensing data from low-resolution (~1 km) platforms with a long-term product archive; (iii) crop models based on crop-specific model calibration from experimental data published in scientific literature; (iv) statistical methods based on trend and regression analysis applied to national level; (v) a team of analysts with specific technical profiles (on meteorology, remote sensing, and agronomy); and (vi) digital classification of very high resolution imagery supported by non-expensive ground surveys for area estimation. In countries where accessibility to local data and resources is high the baseline system can be upgraded enhancing some of the components: sub-national statistical analysis with additional statistical methods like multiple regression or scenario analysis; recruitment of experts on local agricultural conditions in the team of analysts; local calibration of crop models with experimental data; and exploiting high and low resolution biophysical products from remote sensing for crop monitoring.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the usefulness of a co-design process to generate a relevant basket of options for climbing bean cultivation in the context of a large-scale project. The aim was to identify a range of options sufficiently diverse to be of interest for farmers of widely-different resource endowment. The co-design process consisted of three cycles of demonstration, evaluation and re-design in the eastern and southwestern highlands of Uganda in 2014–2015. Evaluations aimed to distinguish preferences of farmers between the two areas, and among farmers of different gender and socio-economic backgrounds. Farmers, researchers, extension officers and NGO staff re-designed treatments for demonstrations in the next season. Climbing bean yields and evaluation scores varied between seasons and sites. Evaluation scores were not always in line with yields, revealing that farmers used multiple evaluation criteria next to yield, such as marketability of varieties, availability of inputs and ease of staking methods. The co-design process enriched the basket of options, improved the relevance of options demonstrated and enhanced the understanding of preferences of a diversity of users. Developing options for resource-poor farmers was difficult, however, because they face multiple constraints. The basket of options developed in this study can be applied across the East-African highlands, with an 'option-by-context' matrix as a starting point for out-scaling. The study also showed, however, that consistent recommendations about the suitability of technologies for different types of farmers were hard to identify. This highlights the importance of a basket of options with flexible combinations of practices rather than developing narrowly specified technology packages for static farm types.",

    "abstract": "Well-functioning fish seed systems are crucial for human nutrition and improved livelihoods. Yet fish seed systems have received considerably little attention in the diffusion process for genetically improved strains. This study examined how seed systems of genetically improved fish strains function, assessed constraints faced, and explored entry-points to increased diffusion. To address these objectives, the study combined the seed systems performance assessment framework with innovation systems thinking. Data came from participatory multi-stakeholder workshops and interviews with tilapia hatchery operators and grow-out farmers in Bangladesh. We found that tilapia seed production and dissemination was profitable and cost-effective indicating a business case for supply chain actors. However, there were several binding constraints including low adoption of elite broodstock, vulnerability to weather shocks and diseases, poor quality of complementary inputs, intermittent electricity supply, hidden costs of seed transportation, and limited market access. These constraints and their causes interacted, creating systemic lock-ins through blocking mechanisms related to incomplete enforcement of regulatory frameworks to control hatchery practices and quality of inputs; limited knowledge about broodstock management, quality seed production, and disease management; weak adaptive capacity to weather shocks; and limited access to credit. Projects, programs, and policies targeted at accelerating adoption of good quality fish seed should focus on the following important aspects. First, strengthening institutional capacity to monitor and enforce quality control. Second, increasing advocacy and knowledge transfer about benefits and sources of elite broodstock. Third, promoting adoption of better management practices by hatcheries and farmers including adaptation to weather shocks. Fourth, leveraging partnerships with local service providers as intermediaries. Fifth, using social networks for information diffusion among farmers.",

    "abstract": "The ecosystem services (ES) concept has brought together research on ecosystems, biodiversity and human well-being, but critical challenges remain to make ES operational. ES assessments are relevant tools in multi-purpose landscapes, such as agricultural landscapes situated within natural protected areas where the challenge is to meet both local livelihoods and conservations goals. La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in south-eastern Mexico has evidenced tensions among social actors due to territorial disputes; local farmers and conservation institutions contest the landscape's land use and ES benefits. We conducted an empirical study in the territory of a small mountain community within this biosphere reserve. We assessed ES in alternative land use scenarios with the aim to generate knowledge in support of local land use and management decisions. We first characterised local land use using mixed methods research and quantified six locally relevant ES: Livelihood ES valued by farmers including forage production, firewood stocks, and resin production, and ES valued by conservation institutions including tree cover, riparian corridor, and tree diversity. Next, four alternative land use scenarios were built based on expert knowledge and stakeholder participation, with a different balance and integration of production and conservation objectives. We then estimated these ES in the four scenarios and assessed ES trade-offs at the farm and landscape level. We found that farm diversity mattered. Though farms presented similar trade-offs in each of the scenarios, the magnitude of these trade-offs varied considerably among small vs. large farms. At the landscape level, the intensive cattle ranching and forest restoration scenarios presented hard trade-offs, compared to the more moderate integrated agroforestry practices scenario. Moreover, the land use zoning scenario, a management strategy promoted by conservation institutions, did not differ from the current landscape nor offer an improvement in conservation indicators. Livestock played a key role in the land system, and trade-offs between forage production and other ES were recurrent across scenarios and spatial scales. Still, management practices that harness biodiversity and ES can improve sustainability of cattle ranching, and thus reconcile production and conservation goals. Relevant ES assessments in agricultural landscapes support local land management decisions, integrate the social–ecological context, and scale up land use scenarios from the farm (fine scale) to the landscape level.",

    "abstract": "On-farm water application in Ethiopia, as in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, is dominated by furrow irrigation, which resulted in inefficient water uses and related economic and environmental problems. A recent project introduced two on-farm water management tools, called wetting front detectors and Chameleon sensors, to some farmers in Koga irrigation scheme and facilitated for other farmers in the quaternary canal, who did not receive the technology, to learn from farmers who installed the tools on their plots. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of different social ties on information exchanges among farmers when some farmers have the signal on how long to irrigate a field during an irrigation event from on-farm water management tools. The study explored the relative importance of being neighbors, friends, spatial proximity of farms, and project induced pairings. The study used a household survey data from all members of quaternary canals in the project that were in the technology, information, and control groups, as well as detailed network modules on how farmers with plots in the quaternary canal are associated with each other. A fixed effects econometric approach is used to control for time invariant household level and quaternary canal characteristics, while teasing out how the different social ties affect the information flow. The results show that being in purposeful friendships as indicated by knowing each other's decision on the use of agricultural inputs and its outcome, as well as being spatially proximate as indicated by having farm plots next to each other or usually passing by each other's plots play a significant role in determining whether information-recipient farmers received information from the technology-recipient farmers as expected. Being relatives or neighbors played a minor role to facilitate information exchanges on how long to irrigate. In addition, ad-hoc pairs of farmers between technology-recipient and information-recipient created through the project within the quaternary canal did not play a significant role above and beyond the existing social ties of friendships and spatial proximity. The findings have implications for effective ways of targeting in future scale up of such technologies as it informs that the roll out of such type of technologies and the extension services around it can better help technology diffusion and learning if they use friends and spatial proximates as anchors of information. That is, at times of over-subscription to such on-farm water management tools, information about the technology and the recommended duration of one irrigation turn can diffuse faster if the limited number of tools are distributed in such a way that friends and spatial proximates have access to a tool, rather than distributing the tools based on being neighbors or relatives.",

    "abstract": "Long fallow, once a common management practice in the low-rainfall of Mediterranean-type environments, may provide growers with an opportunity to switch cropping sequence and reduce the risk of yield and income losses during the recent drought period. However, such benefits are usually not uniform across a spatially variable environment. It is important to identify where long fallow would have a role in increasing crop yield and economic return. To examine the spatial pattern of yield and economic performance of integrating long fallow into a wheat cropping system in dryland Mediterranean environments of Western Australia. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) driven by 0.05° gridded climate over the dry period of 1990–2020 was used to simulate five rotations (fallow followed by one, two, three or four wheat crops, respectively) and continuous wheat. With offset simulations, simulated wheat yields, plant available water at sowing after a wheat crop or long fallow and N fertilizer requirement were compared and analysed for fallow-wheat and wheat-wheat. Wheat yields and economic returns were also calculated for each rotation and compared with continuous wheat. Wheat yield and economic responses to long fallow showed clear geographic patterns that increased from the south-west to north-east across the wheatbelt, which could be explained by climate and soil conditions. Yield increase from fallow could be >6%, equivalent to 13% of economic increase, in the areas where growing season rainfall was <230 mm and the difference in plant available soil water at sowing between fallowed and continuously cropped soil was >30 mm. Although fallow resulted in overall reduction in crop production, integrating one fallow into a continuous wheat sequence every three or more years might achieve similar profit to continuous wheat for fields with weeds and diseases challenges in the north-eastern wheatbelt. The results of yield and economic performance after fallow in the context of space and crop sequence provide a systematic analysis to map where and how fallow could be adopted into cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to achieve groundwater sustainability in California's San Joaquin Valley will entail substantial pumping reductions, and much irrigated cropland may become newly fallowed. Winter crops grown under water-limited conditions could offer an alternative to fallowing, but their viability may be limited by variable rainfall and high crop failure rates. The first objective of this study was to evaluate how small (100–200 mm), targeted irrigation events impact crop establishment, forage and grain yields, and the resulting economic and agronomic water productivity of winter wheat at 4 sites in the San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, we assessed the probability of producing economically viable forage yields across the region based on historical precipitation totals combined with 0, 100, or 200 mm of supplemental irrigation. We used APSIM to run 20-yr simulations of winter wheat establishment and productivity under historical weather conditions at four groundwater dependent sites in California's San Joaquin Valley. For each site, we simulated wheat productivity (biomass and grain) under three irrigation scenarios (no irrigation, 100 mm, or 200 mm) and three sowing dates (mid-October, mid-November, and mid-December). We applied model outputs to calculations of economic and agronomic water productivity, and used the modeled relationship between soft dough biomass yield and total water input (precipitation plus irrigation) to determine the likelihood of a successful wheat crop in any given year across the region. We found that two 100 mm applications of irrigation applied at times of critical soil water depletion decreased crop failure rates from 45% of years to 0% of years at the driest site. Economic water productivity was highest when wheat was harvested for forage at the soft dough stage, and agronomic water productivity of soft dough forage was highest with supplemental irrigation and early planting. Given the precipitation requirements to achieve economically viable soft dough-stage forage yields, the addition of 100 mm of irrigation in a single event expanded the potential cropping area to 11% (126,356 ha) of groundwater dependent cropland in the region, while 200 mm of irrigation expanded the potential cropping area to 100% (1,109,888 ha) of cropland. These results suggest that small, targeted supplemental irrigation events could greatly expand the scope for water-limited winter forage production in the San Joaquin Valley. Such an approach could serve as an alternative to land fallowing in areas transitioning away from irrigated summer crops where appropriate technological and policy mechanisms are in place.",

    "abstract": "Heat exposure, particularly when co-occurring with extreme humidity levels, is amongst the most pronounced and challenging extreme weather conditions in European dairy production. Since these conditions are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency due to climate change, it is crucial to better understand the actual impact under managed production within the European dairy farm population. In this paper, we estimate the impact of heat stress, i.e. hot and humid weather conditions on milk quantity and quality in Flanders, a high intensity dairy production region in Belgium. The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we provide insights in the non-linear response of dairy production (quantity and quality) to extreme heat using farm-level production data. Second, using data from the entire population of farmers in Flanders, and covering 6 years (N = 178.843), our results provide a maximum of representativeness and allows to infer on economic relevance of the effects. We use monthly milk deliveries within the grazing season for the period 2009 to 2014, which we match with temperature and humidity conditions at the barn-level. Using fixed effects regression, we particularly focus on heat shocks, i.e. the deviations from the average climate at the barn location, on production shocks, i.e. deviations from the average production of the barn. We use non-linear restricted cubic splines regression to estimate the response of milk quality and quantity to hourly temperature-humidity (THI) exposure. We find reductions of milk quantity and protein contents under hot and humid conditions, while milk fat content appears unaffected. These results are in contrast to earlier findings of heat exposure on dairy production in two ways. First, we find the critical temperature-humidity threshold above which production is affected to be substantially higher than in earlier/experimental studies. Second, not all quality components are affected by these conditions. We conclude that under managed conditions, farmers seem to be partly able to adapt their production to moderate heat exposure. Our results deliver important implications for policy makers and agricultural practitioners. While we find that farmers seem to be able to cope with moderate heat conditions, milk quality and quantity drop under extreme heat conditions. These impacts are economically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in agricultural water productivity with constrained water resources are often regarded a prerequisite to meet food demands of a growing world population. The WaPOR data portal was launched to monitor biomass, evapotranspiration and biomass water productivity in Africa and the Near East using remote sensing technologies. The WaPOR database shows spatial pixel variation in biomass, suggesting scope to improve water productivity at field level. The aim of this paper is to assess with regression analyses for different spatial and temporal scales whether spatial variability in biomass and evapotranspiration as revealed by WaPOR can be attributed to human influenceable factors, variations in local climate, or methodologically inherent inacuracies of the WaPOR data. Variation in biomass and evapotranspiration data was assessed through agronomic linear regression analyses, for two large-scale irrigated sugarcane estates in Ethiopia (Wonji) and Mozambique (Xinavane). In these cases 82–94% of the variation in biomass and evapotranspiration is attributed to crop photosynthetic efficiency (very large influence), local climate (large influence) and irrigation technology (small influence). The remaining unexplained spatial variability is small (6–18%) and falls within an error range of +/− 9%. In conclusion, WaPOR performed very well by neatly reproducing the conservative relationship between biomass and evapotranspiration, which also means there is very limited scope to improve biomass water productivity through WaPOR monitoring. Further research is recommended on the magnitude of WaPOR accuracy and other sources that explain variations in biomass and evapotranspiration. Applicability of the WaPOR database to monitor biomass water productivity was assessed. Spatial variability in biomass and evapotranspiration data largely stemmed from photosynthesis and local climate, factors farmers and water managers can hardly influence.",

    "abstract": "Smallholders are responsible for a large share of global palm oil production. Yet, in Indonesia, the main palm oil producing country, smallholders' yields remain low. Better management practices, including short harvest interval (HI, the number of days between two harvest rounds), could help to raise smallholder yields. However, at present, HI is long in smallholder fields and the drivers underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. We explored agronomic, socio-economic, and institutional factors that underlie harvesting practices in independent oil palm smallholder farming systems in Indonesia to assess scope for sustainable intensification through shorter HI and reduced harvest losses. Combining methods from agronomy and anthropology, we followed harvest interval of 950 farmers in six representative locations across Indonesia via farmer diaries over a period of two years to establish a correlation with yield. To quantify this relationship, we conducted post-harvest field measurements, and to explain which underlying factors impact HI we did qualitative interviews and surveys. The HI of smallholders in our study ranged from 10 to 39 days (average: 17-d). Half of the farmers followed long HI (>16-d). Key factors impacting HI include annual fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield, total palm area per farmer, trusted labor availability, plantation accessibility, and FFB price. Farmers responded to low yield by prolonging HI to increase labor productivity and optimize labor and transportation costs. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relation between HI and yield in smallholder farming systems, by uncovering how socio-economic and institutional factors sometimes override agronomic considerations. Long HI can potentially lead to harvest loss from loose fruits and missed bunches, and reduce oil quality from overripe bunches. However, to obtain the benefits of shorter HI requires collective action and incentives along the supply chain to streamline the harvest and sale process.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Most crop models are designed for point-based modeling and to simulate agronomic variables on their native spatial footprint, i.e. typically as a uniform field-scale value. Precision agriculture needs crop model simulations at sub-field scales to support differential management application. Spatialization processes are used to change the simulation scale of crop models. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the spatialization of a complex crop model by using a spatial calibration approach to modify its native spatial footprint and to evaluate if it is relevant to use this kind of crop model at the within-field scale. METHODS: APSIM was spatialized to simulate durum wheat yield at different spatial scales (field, within-field and site-scale) on an experimental field under Mediterranean conditions in southern Italy. Ancillary soil data were used to derive potential management (modeling) zones at different scales, which were then used to spatially calibrate soil and biomass parameters in APSIM to spatially predict yield in two different production years (one year was used for calibration and the other for evaluation). Spatialized crop model performances were evaluated using the spatial balanced accuracy (SBA) score, a metric to evaluate the global preservation of patterns between maps. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The spatial structure of the yield data influenced the effectiveness of the spatial calibration process. When the agronomic variable (durum wheat yield) was spatially structured, a spatialized APSIM approached performed best (5-zone modeling scale, SBA = 0.17) and outperformed the field-scale (native footprint) model (SBA = 0.19). In contrast, when the target agronomic variable was more random (less spatially structured), the uniform field-scale modeling performed best and spatial calibration had no benefit. The spatialized APSIM performances were mainly based on the reliability of the delineated zones that undeniably affected the quality of the spatialized model outputs. Thus, more research is needed on how best to model scale-dependent processes to have more reliable modeling at the within-field scale. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the example of a complex crop model like APSIM, this study showed that spatial calibration can be effective and has a role to play in the spatialization of complex crop models.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture provides food, fibre and other resources for people throughout the world, but clearing of native vegetation for agriculture has led to profound losses of biodiversity and changes to ecosystem function. There is growing recognition of the need to retain and restore (semi)natural vegetation in farmland for biodiversity conservation. However, managing such vegetation is complicated by trade-offs between different objectives, and knowledge to guide management is dispersed across multiple fields. We integrate knowledge on the benefits and disbenefits of (semi)natural vegetation on farms for achieving six objectives, including biodiversity, farm production, carbon stocks, soil health, local water cycle, and amenity/human wellbeing. Drawing on scientific literature from temperate southern Australia as a case study region, we develop a conceptual model of the relationships between these objectives and seven common types of native and restored vegetation on farms. From 224 peer-reviewed empirical studies, we identified 19 'causal pathways' by which (semi)natural vegetation provides benefits or disbenefits for the identified objectives. More pathways result in benefits than disbenefits, and generally there is greater support for the benefits provided by native than restored vegetation. Nonetheless, farm-level restoration (revegetation) contributes towards reversing the negative consequences of vegetation loss but this process takes time. Various 'moderating factors' serve to alter the outcome of most pathways. For example, restoration age affects the benefits that revegetation provides for biodiversity, carbon stores, soil health and water cycling. Many moderating factors are related to management practices (e.g. stock grazing, use of fertilisers), highlighting opportunities to enhance the benefits of (semi)natural vegetation in farmland. Relatively little is known about the value of (semi)natural vegetation for amenity/human wellbeing, or the outcomes resulting from natural regeneration. The conceptual model and causal pathways identified here contribute towards a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse benefits of (semi)natural vegetation on farms, which is essential for effective management and the sustainability of agricultural landscapes worldwide.",

The new subroutine simulates canopy photosynthetic response to CO2 concentrations and light levels, and includes the effects of temperature on canopy light-use efficiency. Its performance was compared to the original CERES-Wheat V-2 10 in 30 different cases. Biomass and yield predictions of the two models were well correlated (correlation coefficient r > 0.95). As an application, summer growth of spring wheat was simulated at one site. Modeled crop responses to higher mean temperatures, different amounts of minimum and maximum warming, and doubled CO2 concentrations were compared to observations. The importance of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in modulating the wheat crop climatic responses were also analyzed. Specifically, in agreement with observations, rainfed crops were found to be more sensitive to CO2 increases than irrigated ones. On the other hand, low nitrogen applications depressed the ability of the wheat crop to respond positively to CO2 increases. In general, the positive effects of high CO2 on grain yield were found to be almost completely counterbalanced by the negative effects of high temperatures. Depending on how temperature minima and maxima were increased, yield changes averaged across management practices ranged from -4% to 8%.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the resource use efficiency of agricultural production is considered as a central element in Sustainable Intensification (SI) of agriculture, which is a promising strategy to satisfy increasing demand for food while reducing negative impacts on farm economy and environment.One challenge for SI is that degradation of agricultural soils and resulting crop yield losses are affecting negatively farmers' incomes and environment.This study analyses economic profitability of soil renovation investments aimed for tackling soil compaction in a regional context of south-west Finland, where some individual land parcels are compacted on many farms, implying crop yield losses, which we assume as -30%.We use a dynamic optimisation farm model with multiple input-use responses on crop yields.Explicit field parcel-specific crop-rotation constraints are accounted for in solving the farmers' decision problem of soil-renovation investments.Our results calculated over a 30 year time period suggest that soil-renovation investments are profitable since they produce a positive net present value (NPV) assuming 2000-2014 average crop prices, at all discount rates up to 10% when 30% yield decrease due to soil compaction is assumed.Higher than average crop prices would increase the value of soil renovation investment significantly while lower than average future crop prices would have a relatively small effect on the profitability of soil-renovation investment.The payback times of soil-renovation investments are approximately 8-11 years, depending on the discount rate, but largely independent on crop prices.Soil renovation increases production of higher valued crops, but the utilisation of the whole production potential of a farm is dependent on crop prices.We found that the full increased production potential may not be utilized after the renovation investment if not utilized already without the investment.It is concluded that one may recommend soil-renovation investments as a profitable long-term investment in a typical case, but one cannot recommend the soil renovation if no significant yield gains are possible, or if only low valued crop are to be produced.Nevertheless the field parcel-specific restrictions to avoid soil compaction after the renovation are important to be accounted for in evaluating the profitability of soil renovation at the farm level, since avoiding soil compaction is one part of more sustainable production strategy.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the share of the harvested C ending up in food and returned to soil could contribute to climate change mitigation and food security. The aim of this study was to quantify empirically the proportion of the harvested C ending up in food and soil and the C losses occurring when managing harvested C in smallholder mixed farming systems in Ethiopia. Four case farms were explored; one resource-limited and one better-off farm, in two socio-ecologically contrasting regions important for food production. Material flow analysis (MFA) was used to determine the flows of harvested C. The losses of harvested C, from the livestock, compost and household energy use were quantified based on C balances. The C flows were estimated as means for two growing seasons, 2008/2009 and 2009/2010, with low and average precipitation, respectively. Analysis was founded on semi-structured interviews and sampling, supplemented with information from databases and the literature. From the total harvested C, 9–16% was allocated to food and 4–12% to agricultural soil. Since the residues are utilized apart from human excreta with a negligible significance, increasing the proportion of harvested C used for food and returned to soil is in these farming systems only possible by reducing the gaseous C losses. The largest losses of the harvested C occur through biomass burning (15–60%), animal metabolism (16–44%) and composting (5–23%). The large C loss through the replaceable residue burning seems to offer the most accessible remedy to smallholder management of harvested C. Consequently, the proportion of harvested C used for fuel appears as the main determinant for the proportion of harvested C ending up in soil and food. Energy substitutes for manure and straw, improved manure management and more stable food and fodder supply to reduce the requisite number of animals are all keys to close C cycles in the farming systems. Quantification of the organic C flows using MFA is useful in revealing the allocation of harvested C and losses occurring in its management in farming systems when measurement of gaseous emissions and leaching are not feasible.",

    "abstract": "Cropland intensification promises additional food supply without further expanding croplands into natural ecosystems. Cropland use intensity measures the degree of intensification by various indicators, both from input and output perspectives; all of these indicators are however not always coherent—which may cause confusion and send contradicting signals to policymakers. Few empirical studies have been conducted to relate and compare various intensity indicators. In this study, we start with a hypothesis that cropland use intensity measured by different indicators may differ. We then test such a hypothesis based on empirical evidence in a typical multi-cropped region (i.e., Jinxian County) in Jiangxi Province—a major breadbasket in Southern China. We focus on two widely used indicators, i.e., multi-cropping frequency (MCF) and crop growth duration (GDa), measured by a hybrid time-series remote sensing dataset which fuses MODIS and Gaofen-1 images for the year 2015. We map these two indicators independently at a 16 m spatial resolution. For each pixel, MCF takes value from 1 to 3 corresponding to single-, double- and triple- cropping; while GDa is quantified by the accumulative crop growth days within the study year. We relate the values of two indicators, summarize the descriptive statistics of GDa grouped by MCF categories, and compare MCF and GDa values by using a box-whisker chart, a bivariate map, and a set of statistical tests. We find that a significant overlap of GDa exists between single cropping and double cropping both visually and statistically. In other words, the different cropland intensity levels measured by MCF appear to be the same if measured by GDa. The box-whisker chart shows that the GDa of single cropping in the upper quarter is substantially longer than the GDa of double cropping in the lower quarter. The non-parametric tests show that the overlapped GDa between single cropping and double cropping exists substantially, which may cause confusion. Moreover, the bivariate map shows that single cropping with shorter growth duration (i.e., consistent low intensity) and double cropping with longer growth duration (i.e., consistent high intensity) account for 44% and 28%, respectively, while the rest manifested as inconsistent which accounts for another 28% of the total cropland area. These results confirm our hypothesis—the inconsistency among intensification indicators. Different measurements may convey contradicting messages for policymakers in pursuing the sustainable intensification goals, which suggests more efforts are required to understand the multidimensionality of the process of cropland intensification for distinct policy measurements.",

    "abstract": "Global demand for milk is increasing, however, the dairy sector has considerable environmental impact and cattle are large contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that lead to global warming. In a circular food system, the role of animals should be to convert biomass that humans cannot or do not want to eat into nutrient-dense products. In this system, dairy cows are only fed with grass from marginal lands and by-products from harvesting and food industries. One example of marginal land are peat areas, since these soils are mainly too wet for arable crop production. However, drainage caused peat to oxidize and emit CO2 and N2O. The objective of this study was to evaluate global warming potential (GWP) and economic performance of Dutch dairy farms on peat compared to sandy soil. Also, two scenarios that might reduce GHG emissions of a dairy farm on peat soil were considered: 1) increased groundwater tables and 2) an adjusted dairy cow diet consisting of grass and by-products only. A whole-farm linear programming (LP) model used for dairy farms on sandy soil was updated and adjusted to simulate structure, management and labour income of a dairy farm on peat soil. The basic LP model is a static year model that includes all relevant activities and constraints that are common to a Dutch dairy farm and the solution generates feeding management, manure application and land use. The objective function maximized labour income. In addition, the linear model was combined with a Life-Cycle Assessment to determine the GWP of the produced milk, economically allocated between milk and meat. The results of this study showed that dairy farms on peat soil have lower labour income and considerably higher GWP compared to dairy farms on sandy soil. When the groundwater table on peat soil was increased, labour income decreased even more, however GHG emissions were somewhat reduced. Feeding a dairy cow diet with only grass and by-products resulted in higher labour income, but equal GWP compared to a regular dairy farm on peat soil. A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the effect of grass yield on the economic and environmental performance of dairy farms on peat soil. Dairy farms on peat soils have lower labour income and considerably higher GWP compared to sandy soils. Improvement of GWP is possible and can lead to increased labour income.",

    "abstract": "Whole-farm mathematical programming (MP) models help to understand the complex implications of farm planning decisions taking the full agricultural system into account. Applying optimization models in direct interaction with farmers goes beyond leading to improved recommendations for mixed crop-livestock farm systems. The tacit farmer knowledge revealed in such interaction sessions can also provide valuable input for descriptive and predictive models of farmer behavior in scientific analyses of agricultural policy or technology adoption. To date, a conceptual and technical knowledge divide has prevented the widespread use of MP in interactive modeling with farmers in the field. This article revisits the rationale for interactive MP modeling and explores whether it can be upheld in practice. We evaluate whether a lightweight graphical interface that can be quickly adapted to practical applications of whole-farm planning can help bridge the gap between models and users. We present a user interface for whole-farm MP models implemented in the open-source statistical programming language R. We apply the tool in a participatory research process in Paraguay, analyzing the opportunities and barriers to adoption of new agroforestry options for smallholder farmers. Using in-depth interviews and participant feedback, we evaluate the tool's accessibility, credibility and relevance as well as its contribution to bridging knowledge gaps in the overall research process. In our explorative case study, interactive MP modeling provided essential insights into the local farming system and was highly accepted by smallholder farmers and extension workers. We observed a high interest in structured farm analysis, planning and education for smallholder agriculture. The lightweight user interface contributed to efficient and successful interaction between models and users. Interactive modeling helps to improve the application of whole-farm MP modeling in agricultural systems analysis. Case study examples and a quickly customizable interface can lower the barriers for using interactive MP modeling with farmers and other stakeholders. With the recent wave of digitalization in agriculture, the insights obtained here are also relevant for the development of digital farm management tools for systematic whole-farm planning.",

In some locations, warmer temperatures may offer opportunities to grow novel, high value crops, but non-climatic factors also inform agricultural decision-making. These non-climatic factors can be difficult to quantify and incorporate into suitability assessments, particularly for uncertain futures. To demonstrate how qualitative and quantitative techniques can be combined to assess crop suitability with consideration for climatic and non-climatic factors. We carried out a horizon scanning exercise that used Delphi methodology to identify possible novel crops for a region in south-west England. We show how the results of the expert panel assessment could be combined with a crop suitability model that only considered climate to identify the best crops to grow in the region. Whilst improving climate and crop models will enhance the ability to identify environmental constraints to growing novel crops, we propose horizon scanning as a useful tool to understand constraints on crop suitability that are beyond the parameterisation of these models and that may affect agricultural decisions. A similar combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to assessing crop suitability could be used to identify potential novel crops in other regions and to support more holistic assessments of crop suitability in a changing world.",

    "abstract": "Integrated crop-livestock systems are facing the pressure to intensify worldwide, yet decoupling crops and livestock can lead to specialized systems relying on greater external inputs and potential negative externalities. Our goal was to compare rice-pasture, as the business-as-usual rotation, with two intensified systems, rice-soybean and rice-cover crop, to address the following objectives: 1) quantify partial carbon footprint (CF) including both crop and livestock, 2) develop a multi-criteria performance index based on productivity, economic, and environmental indicators at the systems-level, and 3) evaluate the stability of this index over the study period. To understand how increasing the frequency of annual grain crops influences whole-system sustainability, we evaluated 10 productivity, economic and environmental indicators as well as a multi-criteria performance index and its stability in three rice-based rotation systems over 7 years in Uruguay. Treatments were: (a) rice–pasture [a 5 yr rotation of rice–ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)–rice, then 3.5 yr of a perennial mixture of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.)], (b) rice–soybean [a 2-yr rotation of rice–ryegrass–soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.)– Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.)], and (c) rice–cover crop (an annual rotation of rice–Egyptian clover). Rice-soybean had medium productivity and energy use, resulting in the highest nitrogen and energy use efficiency and among the lowest yield-scaled C footprint. Field greenhouse gas emissions and embodied energy in fuel and agrochemicals were similar in rice-pasture and rice-soybean, but the increase in soil organic carbon in pasture rotating with rice was able to offset this by almost 50%. Rice-cover crop had the highest economic incomes but also the highest input costs, translating into the lowest gross margin. Although the rice-soybean and rice-pasture had a similar gross margin, the variability in rice-pasture was lower and with lower input costs. Rice-soybean and rice-pasture had a multi-criteria performance index 65% higher than rice-cover crop (0.35). Rice-pasture had the highest overall stability across four different stability parameters calculated. We conclude that the intensification of rice-pasture with annual crops could reduce the stability of sustainability without increasing economic performance, even for rice-soybean that showed the best the multi-criteria performance but with less stability across indicators. The findings of this study demonstrate how the integration of rice and pastures with livestock achieves the best combination of stability across profitability and environmental performance, thus mitigating vulnerability to external stressors.",

    "abstract": "Adapting to changes in climate and in consumer demand for commodities will force us to diversify land uses from the current status. Livestock grazing systems are dominant agricultural practices in the western regions of the British Isles. It has been suggested that grasslands in the region could be converted to other land uses, e.g. growing of cereal crops. We hypothesized that soil workability and trafficability would be important factors determining the feasibility and environmental impact of such conversion. Objectives were 1) to investigate the impacts of weather conditions under the current climate on agronomic management and crop yield of winter wheat using the SPACSYS model; and 2) to assess potential impacts of the land use conversion (grassland converted into arable land) on the environment under soil conditions representative of the region under baseline and future climatic conditions. Using simulation modelling we investigated the impacts of baseline and future climates under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5 and RCP8.5) on soil workability and trafficability at sowing and harvest respectively of winter wheat and its consequences for crop productivity and key indices of environmental sustainability for three major soil types of the region. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. Under baseline and future projections, the probability of successfully sowing winter wheat on these soils was between 38 and 76%. Simulations showed that grassland conversion to arable in the region would not be sustainable in terms of carbon sequestration with a decline in soil carbon stock of 165–280 kg C ha−1 yr−1 on average over the simulation period. Rates of decline were greater when soil workability was taken into consideration. Although CO2eq emissions from silage–based grassland soil were higher than those from the converted arable land, these were offset by the greater net productivity of grassland making it a larger net sink for carbon. When soil workability at sowing was considered, the NUEcrop (crop N content/N fertiliser applied) for winter wheat was lower than that for perennial ryegrass on all soil types under the baseline climate and RCP2.6, but comparable or greater under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. In terms of carbon sequestration, grassland conversion for production of winter wheat is unsustainable under these soil–climatic conditions. Our results demonstrated that soil workability is a major factor influencing the potential impact of land-use conversion in clay soils and a wetter climate.",

    "abstract": "In Ethiopia, many agricultural interventions have been introduced for mixed farm types in different biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. The contribution of such interventions to multi-objectives at farm level and beyond remains unclear. To derive insights into interaction of multi-objectives on economic profit-, nutrition security-, and environmental performance that are relevant for improvement of farm household living income in Amhara, Ethiopia. FarmDESIGN model evaluated performance of four stylized medium- and small-scale farm types in a low (Lay Gayint)- and high (South Achefer)- potential district: LG-M, LG-S, SA-M and SA-S. Pareto-based multi-objective optimization was performed to maximize farm profit, livestock density, dietary energy and vitamin A yield, and minimize GHG and soil N losses. Further analysis resulted in 3–4 clusters per farm type with varied farm configurations. Higher dietary energy- and vitamin A- yield that meets household and Ethiopian society requirements increased synergistically with profit in three of the four farm type clusters, while LG-S clusters could only increase vitamin A yield substantially with profit. Only LG-M clusters intensified livestock by addition of 4–8 crossbred cows and 1–10 chickens, supported by imported feed and off-farm grazing but face strong environmental trade-offs of increased GHG and soil N losses. Chicken production (eggs and chicken meat) is an option to reduce environmental impact, increase profit and contribute to both human nutrition requirements. In LG-S, SA-M and SA-S farm type clusters, profit was generated mainly from sale of eucalyptus, maize, potato, carrot, finger millet, garlic, beetroot and banana, with eucalyptus accounting at least 35% of the crop profit. Livestock diversification in these clusters also contributed to farm revenue, but always to a smaller extent, due to relatively high management costs. A living income from farming activities was only achieved on SA-M3 as 3.96 USD/capita/day (+0.36 above the threshold). This cluster had a 2.90 ha land area, farm income almost equally generated from crop and livestock production, and successfully met all set objectives except maximizing livestock density. Our study infers the need to increase land area, expand poultry and rear crossbred cows, and cultivate high value crops to realize a living income solely from agricultural activities. For implementation, current land-use policies should support farm area expansion. The suggested agricultural options, which already align with current Ethiopian development plans, must utilize sustainable measures that will not lead to short- or long-term challenges as higher GHG and soil nutrient mining.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural land management decisions are based on numerous considerations. Belowground carbon (C) storage for both ecosystem health and greenhouse gas (GHG) management is a growing motivation. Observed heterogeneity in soil C storage in croplands may be driven by various environmental, climatic and management factors. Farm system models can indicate which practices will drive C storage, provided the practice is well parameterised and the land manager can provide necessary input data. We aimed to predict soil C impacts of temperate cover cropping using simple models suitable for broad farmer use and decision support. The dataset used was initially compiled for a meta-analysis (McClelland et al., 2021) to quantify soil C response to cover crop treatments relative to a non-cover cropped system. It contains 181 data points from 40 existing studies in temperate climates. Environmental, climatic and management indicators were regressed pairwise to predict annual soil C stock change under cover cropping relative to no cover cropping. We also included the IPCC tier 1 methodology and meta-analysis response ratios in our model comparison. The ease of reliable measurement and monitoring across the modelled indicators was also considered because the best-correlated relationships are squandered if data constraints risk decision-makers being unable to use the model. Using an extended test dataset to consider priorities for model users, several regression models outperformed the IPCC tier 1 methodology. In particular, two regression models reliably predicted negative changes in soil C, which IPCC and meta-analysis factor approaches could not. A single variable regression model based on cover crop biomass (dry matter) production was the best combination of statistical power, biological relevance and parsimony. In temperate climates, we predicted an increase in soil C stocks as long as cover crop biomass production exceeded 1.3 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Our final model can be applied with estimated user input data, and avoids the need for baseline soil C as an input; this makes it relatively accessible for farmers. Parsimonious models for soil C change under land management practices can be effective and are an opportunity to increase access to soil C management information for farmers.",

    "abstract": "The legacy effect of a previous crop on a subsequent crop in rotation is a valuable and often underutilized ecosystem service which can provide benefits when designing cropping systems, especially in the case of cereal-based land use. To support future diversification of crop sequencing in Finland, this study was carried out with the aims to identify the variation in the pre-crop values of relevant crop combinations in farmers' fields in Finland, depending on the weather and farm conditions. We used a method developed to estimate on-farm realized pre-crop value from Sentinel − 2 images available annually for 120,174–711,828 field parcels in Finland during 2016–2020 (the total number of observations was >1,818,000). Both the weather and farming conditions explained the variation in the pre-crop values, which might range from positive to negative. For example, a higher mean temperature and fewer rainy days during the growing season of a previous crop often reduced the legacy effects of crop sequencing, however, this was dependent on the crop choices. A higher number of rainy days and elevated temperatures during the subsequent crop's season often increased the pre-crop value, while prolonged droughts in either of the growing seasons tended to reduce these. The farmers' current land use did not support the realization of pre-crop value – especially in the case of potential benefits provided by grasslands for croplands. This study highlights the challenges that weather variation and complexity of the production systems may cause for a farmer when aiming to identify the impacts of crop sequencing on yields, ecosystem services, and farm economy. Hence, there is an evident need to develop a decision support system that recognizes regional farming systems, available crop choices, crop management, weather conditions, and the farmers' rationale concerning decision making.",

    "abstract": "With labour migration to cities, Chinese agriculture is witnessing the emergence of business farming and an enlargement in farm sizes. Farm size enlargement triggers a wide range of managerial adjustments that may affect the sustainability of crop production practices. There is little empirical information on cropping practices and the sustainability of crop production of business farms as compared to traditional smallholder farms. Here, we made a comparison of cropping activities and sustainability performances between smallholder farms and business farms. Data on cropping activities and crop management were obtained by a survey among 486 smallholder farms and 19 business farms in 35 villages across Quzhou county on the North China Plain. After collecting data, we calculated sustainability indicators at the crop and farm scales. Business farms were about 15 times as large as smallholder farms (14.6 ha versus 0.8 ha) and they had more self-owned machinery. There was no significant difference in the number of crop species cultivated on smallholder or business farms. However, business farms allocated less area to grains and more area to cash crops with high economic benefit, such as stevia and vegetables, than smallholder farms did. Business farms showed some environmental benefits, e.g., business farms used 21% less irrigation water and had 28% lower N surplus. However, there were also trade-offs with business farms having 32% lower dietary energy output per unit area per year than smallholder farms. These differences were associated with better management and lower cropping index (number of crops per year) on business farms as compared to smallholder farms. These results indicate that business farms achieved improvements with respect to environmental externalities of agricultural production, when compared to smallholder farms, but the contribution to grain production was comparatively low. This study shows that scale enlargement of farming in a Chinese context is no panacea for achieving improved crop production sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Predicting future production trends and associated land use and management practices requires an understanding of past changes in productivity and of pathways of evolving system configurations. We argue that rice systems' evolution reflects a process of adaptation to changing availabilities of production resources and the adoption of technological innovations and that differs by marginality/favorability of sites. Understanding past change trends and their determinants can help avoiding undesirable future developments and guide policy decisions for a sustained supply of rice. We aimed to assess agronomic system change and practices, to quantify pathways of change and to identify likely drivers of but also possible risks or opportunities associated with observed patterns of agronomic system transformation in six representative lowland rice production environments in Asia. We implemented a diachronic analysis (years 2000 vs. 2018) of rice production practices and yield attributes in 1024 households. We documented changes between 2000 and 2018 in lowland rice-based systems in six rice-growing environments in the Philippines, Myanmar and Cambodia, differentiating marginal and favorable sites in irrigated and in rainfed environments. Farmers' household attributes, resource endowment, rice yields, and key constraints differed among sites. We observed relatively low annual yield in marginal (2.2–3.0 t/ ha) than favorable (3.3–8.9 t/ ha) sites depending on countries and seasons. The farmers adopted intensification related agronomic practices has increased significantly between 2000 and 2018, especially in dry season (i.e., improved seeds by 28%, mechanical tillage by 52%, direct seeding by 21%, combined harvester by 62%). The marginality of climatic and edaphic conditions, the systems' evolutionary state in 2000, and differential pressures (policy environment), opportunities (technological change) and household attributes (resource endowment) determined the observed transition pathways across study sites. The trends towards maximizing land use intensity (double or multiple cropping), converging in the emergence of high-input and highly mechanized (laborsaving) in irrigated, and diversified rotations in rainfed rice production systems may help to elucidate agricultural research needs and potentially predict the requirements for future sustainable intensification of rice-based systems. Additionally, we argue for a continued need for further mechanization of rice establishment, especially shifting from transplanting to direct seeding during dry and wet seasons, and of the rice harvest, especially during wet season under fully irrigated environments.",

    "abstract": "Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) remains a persistent challenge for small ruminant production in Senegal, leading to economic losses for livestock keepers. Gender dynamics and socio-cultural factors influence production decisions at the household level. Despite its relevance, economic impact models of PPR have not incorporated gender dynamics. This paper seeks to redress this gap by disaggregating the farm-level impacts of PPR based on the gender of the household head and implementers of routine and management activities in small ruminant production at the household level. To quantify the gendered economic impacts of PPR, a system dynamics model was developed with four modules: integrated production-epidemiology, economics and profitability, disease control, and marketing. The model was parameterised based on survey data from 747 households in 49 agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Senegal and augmented by secondary data. The model was validated (structurally and behaviourally) and simulated for 30 years with a weekly timestep. A set of disease scenarios were run for ten different farm household typologies based on the gender of the household head and household members who perform production management activities (like purchasing, selling, gifting, and vaccinating animals) and routine activities (like feeding, cleaning pens, and caring for sick animals). Model results estimated annual reductions in farm profitability of 51% to 61% with a hypothetical 25% incidence rate of PPR, corresponding to an average of $1051 to $1246 USD lost per household per year. In the two most impacted household typologies, management activities were performed by either men only or women only, and in the three least impacted household typologies, management activities were shared by men and women. The least impacted household typology with the highest gross margins without PPR ($2429 USD per year) and the lowest percentage of loss (51%) was female-headed households with men and women doing management tasks and primarily women or girls doing routine activities. Households with both women and men engaged in management activities were less impacted by PPR, highlighting the crucial role of women's agency in management decisions taken in small ruminant production at the farm level. The findings further provide the empirical grounding for considering gender dynamics in interventions to control PPR and other livestock diseases in small ruminant production systems.",

    "abstract": "As the concept of social-ecological resilience gains increasing policy attention, there is growing demand for approaches that operationalise it. Amongst these demands is the need to empirically assess absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities that underpin resilience to better understand the ways in which social-ecological systems can navigate change and uncertainty. We explore the application of a capitals approach for assessing resilience capacities, using an example of deciduous fruit farming operations in the Western Cape region of South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, thematically coded, and analysed using causal loop diagrams and co-occurrence analyses to identify changes experienced by farming operations, their responses to these changes, and the effects of both on capital resources. We then apply the criteria developed for the classification of resilience capacities. A variety of changes affect farming operations at multiple points across the value chain, and have effects across capital resources. Most significant to farmers are changes which impact the amount of water available and the cashflow they require to sustain their operations. The most common responses employed by farmers consisted of activities which either increase the availability of an affected resource, or decrease its demand in order to maintain the same functions (adaptive capacity). In fewer cases, farming operations were able to absorb the depletion of their capital resources due to pre-emptive management (absorptive capacity). In similarly few cases, the potential or realised resource deficiencies caused by changes were either corrected or decoupled from the farming operation through structural reorganisation towards a different or additional function and types of output being delivered (transformative capacity). Evidence of changes being anticipated prior to their onset were also identified, leading to responses which are used in conjunction with the preceding three capacities. Our findings suggest that the criteria we developed for classifying resilience capacities offer a useful means of operationalising resilience. In particular, the approach we pilot in this paper enables the application of a systems perspective to identify interactions between changes and responses, which broadens the options for identifying management strategies and interventions. The approach we propose can be used to identify key leverage points to strengthen the capacities of vulnerable farmers. Further work is required to integrate consideration of cross-scale effects of farm-scale resilience strategies on the broader social-ecological system.",

    "abstract": "Pasture dynamics of Alpine areas are linked to the complex cryospheric hydrology of Alpine catchment and to the interspecies competition, which are in turn expected to change remarkably under prospective global warming scenarios. This study aimed at assessing the impact of climate change on the productivity of mountain pastures in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). The hydrological model Poli-Hydro was used, coupled with the Poli-Pasture model, able to simulate pasture growth, which was further integrated with CoSMo model to consider interspecific competition. Two (competing) species were chosen for low altitude LowAlt areas (below 1800 m asl), Trifolium alpinum and Dactylis glomerata, and two for high altitude HighAlt areas (above 1800 m asl), Festuca rubra and Nardus stricta. Model tuning and evaluation were performed against estimates of leaf area index (LAI), derived from satellite imagery during 2005–2019. Then, climate change impacts were projected until 2100 by considering four IPCC AR6 scenarios and six GCMs. Target variables included a set of agroclimatic indices, LAI and pasture yield. Due to the projected increase in temperatures during the XXI century, a measurable potential increase in productivity would be expected, especially in the highest areas (up to +97% by 2050, and + 123% by 2100 for the SSP5–8.5 scenario). The relative abundance of pasture species appears to remain mostly stable; at most, the species with higher fodder value even increases slightly. This suggests that a loss in the overall quality of biomass should not occur. These results provide preliminary evidence for the potential development of livestock farming, and thus of a relevant part of the economy in the valleys, at higher altitudes than now. However, to a certain extent pasture performance could be threatened by the projected reduction in summer rainfall, and possibly spreading of pests with increasing temperature. The results obtained here could be useful for policy makers, and scientists in the field of pasture/grasslands management, to depict scenarios of future productivity, and to support redefinition of periods, and areas designated for grazing activities in the mountains.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, environmental policies, especially in North-western European countries have put pressure on the total livestock on a dairy farm. On closed dairy farms this primarily has resulted in a reduction of the heifer rearing unit to maintain the production unit. The economic consequences of constrained replacement heifer supply on herd level have not been investigated. The objective of this study is to study on herd level the economic impact of suboptimal replacement decisions due to a constrained replacement heifer supply. In this study, we combine a single-cow MDP (Markov Decision Process) optimization model with dairy herd dynamics simulation of 10 years to account for the interdependency among dairy cows within the herd of 100 cows. Besides the base scenario of following optimal replacement policy, we simulated three input scenarios of constrained, excess, and variable replacement heifer supply. In the base scenario, optimal replacement policy resulted in a herd gross margin of €155,108, 11% voluntary replacement rate, 24% involuntary disposal rate annually for a herd of 100 cows. Constrained as well as excess heifer supply resulted in lower gross margins of €85,878 and €138,406 respectively, compared to the base scenario. Constrained heifer supply also resulted in 39% reduction of herd size, involuntary disposal of 17.5% and no voluntary replacements (0.1%) on average per year. Variable heifer supply scenario resulted in lower gross margins (€115,127), lower voluntary replacement rate (4%), highest involuntary disposal rate (28%) but did not result in reduction of herd size, compared to the base scenario. In conclusion, we developed a combination of cow level optimization with a herd level simulation to study the economic impacts of constrained replacement heifer supply. We found that severely constrained, excess, and variable heifer supply result in reduced herd average gross margin. Optimization replacement policy in case of limited heifer availability requires an inter-cow comparison to determine which cows need to be replaced first as this study shows. By demonstrating a simplified approach of combining individual cow optimization with herd dynamics simulation, we accounted for the inter-dependencies within herd. Such an approach can be instrumental in studying environmental impacts, longevity, and welfare of cows when heifer supply is constrained on a herd level.",

    "abstract": "Crop breeding teams should ideally work a-priori to rank research priorities and varietal product concepts to make decisions considering social, environmental, production and market conditions that an improved crop variety will be entering upon release. Frequently, this research prioritization is guided by a cost-benefit optimization framing, which leaves the potential derived by alternative approaches, such as inclusive innovation, unexplored. In this study, we apply PEEP (Participatory Ex-ante framework for Plant breeding), a new methodological framework for ex-ante participatory priority setting for plant breeding programs. This framework explores how, given a set of hypothetical crop varieties (varietal product concepts) it is possible to assess which will have the highest potential to deliver research impacts. PEEP is designed to support crop breeders to understand the impact potential of a new varietal product concept, and strategically make decisions based on this. PEEP ranks varietal product concepts across five impact domains: breeding, processing, marketing, climate, and cross-cutting themes. This paper reports on how an interdisciplinary breeding team from the Institute of Environment and Agricultural Research (INERA) in Burkina Faso working on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp) applied PEEP and discusses the results from this application. We chose cowpea as a crop focus, based on prior research that showed that gender and social differences shape roles, responsibilities, and benefits from its cultivation in Burkina Faso. We engaged 650 stakeholders using tools and methods (choice experiment, surveys and focus group discussions) tailored to collect information according to their spheres of knowledge. We present a reflection on the application process, results, and feedback from the INERA cowpea breeding team on these. We show that breeders and farmers ranked the potential impact of the varietal product concepts differently. We also show that differences in evaluation of impact from varietal product concepts vary based on market orientation, agroecological zones, farming systems and gender. We demonstrate that PEEP contributes to inclusive agricultural innovation as a feasible method to consider the knowledge and preferences of diverse stakeholders. We show that it is informative to include diverse groups when conceptualizing new varieties before investing in varietal development. Making such research prioritization decisions early on enables breeding programs to avoid \"missing the mark\" on assumed impacts on smallholder women and men farmers and increases their visibility and voice in these upstream decisions.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the Mekong region has experienced significant transformation of its agricultural sector from subsistence farming to export crops driven by the expansion of agricultural land and of irrigation, plus intensification thanks to mechanization and the use of chemical inputs. In the context of agrarian transition, maintaining \"organic by default\" rice farming systems that do not rely on chemical inputs, is challenging. Based on a case study in Preah Vihear, the organic province of Cambodia, this paper examines whether organic rice certification can maintain \"organic by default\" practices in a context of unprecedented agricultural intensification. Using agrarian diagnosis, we investigated the impacts of an organic rice certification scheme on the future of organic rice-based farming systems. We built a functional typology of five farming systems that co-exist in the study area to understand the roles of organic rice in each system. From an economic perspective, organic rice is less profitable than recently introduced cash crops, e.g. cassava, cashews. The positive impact of certification of organic rice is threatened by lock-in factors, e.g. labor diversification in both farming and non-farming activities, cash flow management, the certification process, leading farmers to abandon organic rice for cash crops for export. We discuss the key role of agricultural cooperatives in the certification process of organic rice. The paper questions the capacity of a certification scheme to keep up with the process of intensification that undermines the profitability of the remaining \"organic by default\" rice systems. Beyond the significance of the results in the study area, one of the last strongholds of traditional rice systems in Cambodia, the paper illustrates the disappearance of \"organic by default\" rice systems in the whole country as well as in the Mekong region.",

This study aimed to quantify nutrient deficits and losses from DFSs with different manure management systems (MMSs) at the farm level and at the levels of its sub-systems. We compared NP balances of 30 farms with four different MMSs: applying manure directly on forage land, without treatment (ADL), selling or exporting manure (SEL), using manure for anaerobic digestion (ADI), and discharging manure (DIS). NP balances were calculated based on differences between in- and outflows. Results showed that N balances at DFS averaged 222 kg N farm−1 yr−1 and did not differ between MMSs. Average P balances at DFS differed between MMSs; balances were highest for DIS (83 kg P farm−1 yr−1), and lowest for SEL (−25 kg P farm−1 yr−1). Soil P balances did not differ between MMSs and were mostly negative, except for four ADL farms. Annually, all dairy farms in Lembang region are estimated to cause a nutrient loss of ∼1061 tons of N and ∼ 290 tons of P, and extract 8 tons of P from soils. Overall, high NP imbalances are caused by discharging manure into the environment. To reduce imbalances, collection and on-farm use of manure must be improved, and excess manure needs to be sold to crop farms. The carrying capacity for high-input high-output dairy farming is determined by the capacity of arable farms to apply the manure surpluses.",

    "abstract": "Statistical methods used for delineation of field management zones and yield stability are frequently only applied to relatively small areas, with few studies performing rotational, whole-farm economic spatiotemporal appraisals. To enable accurate economic analysis, yield map datasets must contain minimal errors while cleaning procedures are often used to remove errors, it is rare that cleaned data is validated before its application. The objective of this study was to process, validate and combine spatial statistical approaches for a rotational yield map dataset from a whole-farm across 7 crops in a winter wheat based rotation. Developing a framework for using validated yield map datasets to support precision agriculture techniques that are applicable for farm-level decision making. The rotational completeness of a 10 year combine yield map dataset for a 435 ha farm in Eastern England was assessed. The dataset was cleaned statistically, and its accuracy assessed by comparison with recorded yields from trailer weigh cells. The cleaned, validated, and corrected yield map dataset was used to identify management zones across the whole farm using fuzzy clustering. The temporal stability of management zones and economic performance across the rotation was also assessed. Data cleaning methods removed 16% of data points, improving the degree of spatial correlation within the individual yield maps. Independent validation demonstrated varied accuracy of yield maps from combine harvester data and errors in wheat ranged from 0.53 to 1.53 t/ha RMSE. These errors have implications for researchers using combine yield data to develop and validate precision agriculture technologies. This data set required correction before yield data can be applied with confidence for on-farm decision making. Compared to the zones with the highest margin in each field, 34% of zones had an average annual margin loss of >£100 ha. The temporal stability of the resulting management zones also varied. Areas with the lowest economic performance and greatest yield stability across years will potentially see the greatest economic and environmental benefits from precision agriculture techniques. The accuracy of combine yield map data should not be assumed. The application of these datasets, including for the identification of management zones or in developing precision agriculture techniques should attempt to address this through data cleaning and validation procedures. Only then should it be used for on farm decision making, such as identifying areas with the most economic benefit by applying precision agriculture tools such as variable rate nutrient applications.",

    "abstract": "An important question for farmers is whether to run their farm conventionally or organically. This choice can significantly affect the farm's financial performance and its impact on the environment. The primary objective of this study is to compare the profitability of conventional and organic cattle systems and investigate how it is associated with individual farm characteristics, like forage production capacity, forage quality, milk quota, animal housing capacity, and their relative presences. We employ a whole farm optimization model, customized for Norwegian cattle farming. The primary goal of this model is to maximize the gross margin by optimizing decisions related to land usage and animal inventory while adhering to a set of constraints. We systematically solve more than 200,000 model instances, with varying farm characteristics. The results can be distilled to the following key points: If forage of good quality is readily available, but the livestock operation cannot be expanded due to animal housing and milk quota restrictions, organic may outcompete conventional farming. Otherwise, gross margin is maximized with conventional farming. These findings emphasize the crucial role of forage production capacity and quality in relation to available milk quota and infrastructure when considering the transition from conventional to organic farming. Extensive sensitivity analyses affirm the robustness of these conclusions. Regional regulatory factors, such as government farm payments, also play a significant role, and influence the optimal farming approach. Additionally, we show that increases in organic price premiums can markedly impact the competitiveness of organic farming, even in a system where government payments make out a significant part of the farm revenue. The model can support farmers to make informed decisions about converting to organic or conventional farming. It can also be used by policymakers to determine the level of support required to make it worthwhile for different types of farms to convert. We also show that existing government payment schemes give rise to regional differences in the incentives for organic farming in Norway. To ensure equal incentives for organic farming across the country, the organic payments would have to be regionally adjusted, in line with the other already regionally dependent government payments. This insight may be of significant interest to policymakers and other stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "On the Greek island of Samothraki, decades of overgrazing by the large domestic population of small ruminants accelerated soil degradation and surface erosion, with direct consequences for ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services. This manuscript reports on a 5-year research project to achieve more sustainable pasture management practices among small ruminant farmers on the island, through the introduction of Sown Biodiverse Pastures (SBP). This practice, based on sowing a seed mixture of legumes and grasses that increase pasture productivity, has proven to be a successful tool to overcome degradation of ruminant pastures in Portugal. Local small ruminant farmers on Samothraki, a difficult group when it comes to the acceptance of new practices and ideas, were engaged in the transdisciplinary research process, and trained in appropriate management practices of SBP. This led to the adoption and implementation of SBP by nine farmers on 13 parcels. Quantitative data on species composition and productivity shows that the performance and persistence of SBP on Samothraki is favourable, if soil preparation and sowing is practiced as recommended, and relevant management practices are adopted. Comparing with conventional agricultural practices, i.e. annual crop – fallow rotation, productivity in SBP outperformed the forage quantity in fallow land, while yield in the annual crop was approximately equal as compared to SBP. The increasing forage capacity of SBP instigates several environmental and economic benefits, such as a reduction of grazing pressure in vulnerable areas, and less expenditure on supplementary feed requirements. However, lack of will and trust in these new practices and seed mixtures among local farmers resulted in discontinuation in almost half of the parcels. The adoption of new management practices by the farming community on Samothraki required continuous efforts, and the short-term framework of the research project did not favour long-term success. It is recommended for any programs aiming at changing farming practices to engage with local stakeholders, especially farmers, and to closely collaborate with local institutional partners who can carry the work forward after scientific researchers have left.",

We extracted economic indicators, proxies for animal welfare and environmental performances, and data describing farming practices and conditions from a technical-economic database featuring data collected from >250 French suckler farms over the period 2016–2022. We analysed the relationships between animal welfare performance, environmental performance and economic performance using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. We then used logit models to identify farming practices and conditions that promote 'multiperformance'. Farms that combine practices where nutritional needs of suckler cattle are synchronised with the grass availability cycle are more likely to multiperform. The synchronisation is managed by exploiting certain key animal characteristics (depletion and restoral of body reserves), choosing the right calving season, and selling animals well adapted to grass-feeding. Combining two analytical models—one establishing the relationships between several performance dimensions and one establishing the relationships between multiperformance and farming practices—allows to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and concrete farming measures on the topical issue of achieving multiperformance in more than two dimensions, where the literature is still scarce.",

    "abstract": "Despite their interest for agro-ecological transition, grain legumes remain poorly cultivated in France. One reason is the low availability of seed innovations for farmers which, to a large extend, is related to the low incentives to innovate for these crops which represent a small acreage. In this article, we analyze the link between market size and the efforts made to create, diffuse and value innovation. We compare two value chains related to two field crops in France that mainly differ in terms of market size, namely, pea and wheat. Our analysis focuses more specifically on the seed-related innovations created in the upstream part of these value chains. In both of these cases, innovation relies on multiple complementary activities carried out by different actors, including the creation of the innovation, the production and diffusion of technical knowledge, the production and distribution of the innovation, and its valorization by downstream users. The two case studies on the pea and wheat sectors were conducted using a qualitative approach based on public documentation, 16 semistructured interviews with various actors in the innovation system of the two value chains and data on commercialized pea and wheat varieties. We show that the level of investment in each of these activities is highly related to market size. This result is first explained by the fact that part (if not all) of the cost of these activities is fixed; that is, these activity costs do not depend on the diffusion of innovation. This result is also explained by the complementarity of these activities, which makes the investment in one activity less beneficial if the investment in complementary activities is low. As a consequence, the effect of market size on innovation is self-reinforcing in those cases where innovation relies on different activities managed by different actors. In agricultural sectors, where there is a need for innovations in both large and small markets, this result calls for an evolution of innovation funding mechanisms to attenuate the impact of market size.",

    "abstract": "As interest grows in facilitating, funding, and investigating inclusive innovation processes in agrifood systems in the Global South, a need has emerged for middle-range theory that can describe the key features and causal dynamics of these processes across diverse contexts. This paper advances theory-building by testing and refining an existing middle-range theory of inclusive innovation processes in agrifood systems in the Global South through a case study of an inclusive innovation process involving smallholder farming communities in the Ecuadorian Andes. We used a case study replication design to test the initial theory. To develop the case study, we conducted primary qualitative research, including interviews, informal personal communications, and document reviews. Data analysis was conducted in two phases: in the first phase, we developed a timeline and causal narrative of the case and in the second phase, we conducted inductive and deductive thematic analysis. We find that each component of the existing middle-range model played an important role, as predicted, in the inclusive innovation process described in the case study. Our analysis also reveals additional component categories, including process inputs, initial contextual conditions, and actor-level mechanisms, that featured prominently in the case but were omitted from the existing theory. The case also revealed a more nuanced, phased causal dynamic than that described in the existing middle-range model and identified intermediate pilot results as boundary objects that expanded the inclusivity of the innovation process and triggered the causal dynamics predicted by the existing theory. Our findings inform a revision to the existing mid-level model, contributing to building an empirically validated theory of how inclusive innovation processes unfold in agrifood systems that sheds light on specific features of these processes that are important for promoting inclusivity.",

    "abstract": "Intensified agricultural production systems relying on larger field sizes and homogeneous landscapes result in land degradation, biodiversity losses, and impaired ecosystem services, particularly regulating services such as water and climate regulation. A multifunctional landscape composition and configuration promises higher ecosystem functionality by balancing ecological and economic provisioning functionality for food, fuel, and fiber. However, to the best of our knowledge, not much is known about the synergies and trade-offs of different landscape compositions and configurations and landscape designs providing ecosystem functionality in economic and ecological dimensions. We addressed the question whether the ecosystem functionality of agricultural landscapes can be improved at given levels of economic valuation. We quantified potential improvements of ecosystem functionality through multifunctional landscape composition and configuration. We identified agricultural landscapes that provide high ecosystem functionality at their level of economic valuation, given that such regions may serve as role models for a target landscape composition. Using an eco-efficiency approach based on the non-parametric order-m estimator, we quantified potential improvements of ecosystem functionality at the agricultural landscapes scale. We used the 20 km2 hexagonal grid level in the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We described landscape composition and configuration using spatially explicit land cover data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS); land value data indicated the economic output of the landscape. We investigated robustness of our results under different grid specifications (10–50 km2) and using subsamples of regions with similar environmental conditions. We found on average high eco-efficiency of agricultural landscapes in the study region. We also found notable improvement potentials in at least one ecological indicator that were spatially clustered. The results suggest the potential for Pareto improvements, i.e., increasing landscape eco-efficiency without sacrificing economic outputs. We present a novel empirical approach to evaluate the eco-efficiency of agricultural landscapes and investigate spatial patterns of eco-efficiency at the landscape scale. We modeled landscapes' potential multifunctionality at a fine regional scale using indicators for landscape composition and configuration based on spatially explicit and highly granular land use and land management data. We relied on publicly available data, and our approach can serve to develop monitoring or policy evaluation at the landscape scale.",

    "abstract": "While climate change threatens maize growth and production, appropriate N fertilizer use (N) can help mitigate this threat and stabilize or improve maize yields. Accurate application of N fertilizer is of increasing interest as an adaptation measure for climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing economic returns. The objectives of this study are to: 1) clarify how maize yields respond to N fertilizer use under changes in temperature and precipitation, and 2) explore the effects of various climate conditions on N fertilizer use efficiency. We used a long-term and county-level maize N fertilizer use and climate dataset from 1981 to 2019 in Kansas to determine the impact of N fertilizer use on maize yield. We developed a panel data model with fixed effects, incorporating explanatory variables, including the interaction of growing-degree-days (GDD) with N fertilizer use (GDDit*Nit), extreme-degree-days (EDD) with N fertilizer use (EDDit*Nit), and precipitation (Precip) with N fertilizer use (Precipit*Nit), along with a non-linear N-fertilizer use term. Then, the adaptive effects of N fertilizer use on climatic risks for maize were examined and the county-level results were aggregated into the nine crop reporting districts, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. Our results show that: 1) an increase in N fertilizer use magnified the negative effects of higher EDD on maize yield but enhanced the positive effects of higher GDD and precipitation on maize yield, impacts which were increasingly evident moving from western to eastern regions across Kansas; 2) hotter environments reduced maize yield by 7% in the west; conversely, warmer and wetter environmental conditions contributed to 2.4% yield gains in the southeast; changes in N fertilizer use impacted maize yield to a lesser extent than climate changes; and 3) under the averaged climate conditions, the optimal N fertilizer rate increased from northwestern (average 50 kg N ha−1) to eastern (average 158 kg N ha−1) regions in Kansas. Our results reveal the interaction between climate and N fertilization on maize yield and clarify how the efficiency of N fertilizer use is affected by various climatic conditions. Our findings highlight the quantifiable interactions between climate and N fertilizer use when evaluating dynamic N fertilizer applications and climate change adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Agroecological practices are known to reduce environmental pressure of farming systems and increase food system resilience in tropical regions. In contrast, in the temperate climate and industrialized agricultural context of the Netherlands, agroecology use remains limited and its impacts are unknown. As agroecological systems can form a sustainable alternative to conventional farming, it is relevant to study to what extent farmers use agroecological practices in the Netherlands, potentially serving as a model for transition. This study assesses spatial patterns of uptake of agroecological practices and their relationship with income resilience. Using data from 735 Dutch farms, we created a composite Agroecology Index to quantify the extent of use of agroecological practices. The FAO's 10 Elements of Agroecology framework was used to select indicators for the index, by selecting the six of the Elements in this framework for which our dataset contained suitable data. Linear regressions explored underlying factors, such as farm size and farm type. Using an outlier analysis, bright and dark spot farms, exceeding or lagging the Dutch average, were mapped. We evaluated the effects of agroecological practices on income resilience over a 10-year period. On a 0–100 scale, agroecology scores ranged from 16.5% to 61.1% (36.6 ± 7.0), with stark contrasts between different Elements of agroecology. Arable farms excelled in Diversity, while livestock farms performed better in Efficiency. Spatial variation was substantial, with both bright and dark spots dispersed across the country. We found highest average scores and the strongest prevalence of bright spots in the province of Flevoland, an area with an exceptional number of organic farmers. Higher agroecology scores were linked to increased income stability, independent of farm size or type. The methods developed in this study provide an approach to address the growing demand for evidence of the upscaling of agroecology in practice. Also, the relationships between agroecology and social and environmental outcomes from farm to regional scales can be addressed, which can guide developments towards sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Intensification of arable farming in Northwest Europe has led to high yields. However, inadequate use of external inputs such as nutrients, irrigation water and crop protection products has contributed to several environmental problems, such as nitrate leaching and losses of crop protection products. There is a need to reduce environmental losses and contribute to a more circular and sustainable agriculture in Northwest Europe. Here, we take ware potato production in the Netherlands as an example cropping system to assess if there is scope to reduce input levels and environmental impact of nutrient, water and crop protection product use without compromising yield. We determined variability in use and use efficiency of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and pesticides as well as water productivity (WP) and yields of 96 on-farm ware potato fields in the Netherlands, on both clay and sandy soils. In addition, we assessed if relatively high performance could be achieved on multiple environmental indicators simultaneously. Average N surplus was 265 kg N ha−1 on clay soils and 139 kg N ha−1 on sandy soils and varied among fields by a factor three. Phosphorus and K input exceeded P and K output on clay soils by 33 and 105 kg ha−1, respectively, while on sandy soils P and K balances were close to zero. Mean WP was 43 kg dry matter (DM) mm−1 ha−1 and ranged from 30 to 60 kg DM mm−1 ha−1 for both soil types. In terms of crop protection product use, lowest and highest use differed by a factor four. Unexpectedly, yields did not increase with higher input rates, suggesting that lower input rates are sufficient to obtain current yields. Consequently, input rates were the most important drivers to explain variability in resource use efficiency and environmental impacts. At the same time, a comparison across multiple indicators simultaneously showed that it was possible to achieve relatively high yields with relatively low N surplus, high WP, and low crop protection product use. Hence, environmental impact could decrease substantially if all fields performed similar to the best performing fields. This study showed that it seems feasible to maintain high yield levels while reducing resource use in a substantial share of the potato production fields in the Netherlands. If put in practice, this will reduce losses to the environment and therefore contribute to a more sustainable but still productive agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Smallholder farmers may gain notable livelihood benefits by participating in organic value chains. However, whether there are enough resources available to maintain organic production sustainably on smallholder farms in resource-poor regions is of concern. If not balanced by sufficient inputs, continual nutrient export via commodity crops will result in nutrient mining, and livelihood improvements gained by participating in profitable value chains could be negated by soil degradation in the long term. The objectives of this study were to test an integrated approach for understanding the farm-level impacts of subsystem nutrient management actions and to identify locally viable interventions for increased nutrient supply and recycling. We employ a systems analysis methodology to address the nutrient gaps on smallholder farms in Uttarakhand, India producing organic Basmati rice for an international value chain. Farmers here rely on few livestock (three to five head of cattle ha − 1 ) to supply nutrient inputs and are achieving smaller than potential Basmati yields. We surveyed 42 small farms (< 3.5 ha, average annual income around $1000 year − 1 ) and analyzed available manure stocks for nutrient contents in order to trace the farm-level flow of manure nutrients, identify vectors of avoidable nutrient loss, and systematically identify locally relevant and feasible improvements. The interventions identified as viable were reducing nutrient losses through simple and relatively cheap manure management modifications (i.e. using straw bedding to capture livestock urine, covering farmyard manure stockpiles with plastic sheeting, enclosed biogas slurry storage, and using biogas slurry for improved compost production), in situ green manuring, and purchasing farmyard manure. Cost–benefit analyses predicted that proposed interventions could increase farmers' net profit by up to 40% while also addressing problematic nutrient gaps. While our results pertain specifically to Uttarakhand, we found that our integrated research approach worked well to address the problem of nutrient gaps on resource-poor smallholder organic farms, and believe that the strategy could be used with equal success to address similar problems in other regions. • Farmers in the case study lack enough manure to meet nutrient needs of Basmati. • We explore locally viable methods to improve farm nutrient supply and recycling. • A systematic assessment identified avoidable nutrient leaks in manure subsystems. • Farm profit and nutrient status can be improved with simple interventions. • Proposed interventions could increase farmers' net profit up to 40%.",

    "abstract": "The potential role of irrigation of cereals as a response to climate change is under debate. Especially under temperate continental conditions empirical evidence of crop yield response to irrigation in interaction with nitrogen fertilizer supply is rare. Besides mean yield effects, irrigation reduces yield variance, which may be an incentive for farmers to use irrigation. This paper investigates the risk-efficiency of irrigation in cereal production in a temperate continental climate, based on data from a long term field experiment on a sandy soil. Irrigation and no irrigation of winter rye (Secale cereale) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) were investigated in three different nitrogen (N) fertilizer levels. Crop yield response data (1995–2010) to irrigation and N fertilizer were used to calculate net returns, certainty equivalents (CE) for different levels of risk aversion and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a downside risk indicator in two price scenarios. The scenarios were calculated with a total cost and a partial budget approach. Irrigation was found to be profit-maximizing in all partial budget calculations, which sometimes required higher N input to be profit-maximizing. Irrigation and N fertilizer reduction were identified as risk mitigation strategies, even though their impact was limited. Irrigation reduced the downside risk only in the partial budget calculations. The analysis based on the CE did not show improved risk efficiency with irrigated management options. In contrast, reduced fertilizer input proved to be risk efficient at specific levels of risk aversion. The price expectations of winter rye and winter barley had a much higher impact on the ranking of the management options than risk aversion based on the crop yield variances. At low crop prices for all levels of risk aversion, irrigation of winter barley and winter rye was only economically justified if fixed costs for irrigation were not taken into account. At high crop prices, irrigation of winter barley was also justified based on the total cost calculation. However, this advantage was only given at a very low level of risk aversion. With increasing levels of risk aversion irrigation was not efficient based on the CE in the total cost accounting scenario. In conclusion, irrigation of cereals can contribute to downside risk mitigation and increased profits, if fixed costs for irrigation are covered. However, this conclusion holds only when irrigation is combined with an increased N intensity. If total costs need to be accounted for, irrigation in cereals is not an appropriate risk reduction strategy and a reduction of N input is more effective.",

    "abstract": "Trade-offs between livelihood and environmental outcomes due to agricultural intensification in sub-Saharan Africa are uncertain. The present study measured yield, economic performance and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in African indigenous vegetable (AIV) production to investigate the optimal nutrient management strategies. In order to achieve this, an on-farm experiment with four treatments – (1) 40 kg N/ha diammonium phosphate (DAP), (2) 10 t/ha cattle manure, (3) 20 kg N/ha DAP and 5 t/ha cattle manure and (4) a no-N input control – was performed for two seasons. Yields and N2O emissions were directly measured with subsampling and static chambers/gas chromatography, respectively. Economic outcomes were estimated from semi-structured interviews (N = 12). Trade-offs were quantified by calculating N2O emissions intensity (N2OI) and N2O emissions economic intensity (N2OEI). The results indicate that, DAP alone resulted at least 14% greater yields, gross margin and returns to labour in absolute terms but had the highest emissions (p = 0.003). Productivity-climate trade-offs, expressed as N2OI, were statistically similar for DAP and mixed treatments. However, N2OEI was minimized under mixed management (p = 0.0004) while maintaining productivity and gross margins. We therefore conclude that soil fertility management strategies that mix inorganic and organic source present a pathway to sustainable intensification in AIV production. Future studies of GHG emissions in crop production need to consider not only productivity but economic performance when considering trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen, invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces crop yields. Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha). Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one year may be poorest in the next. We answer the question: \"Why would a farmer in this district choose to apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment, georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map data for that paddock in many past seasons?\" We show that soil conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging. If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season, applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable. We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable, fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices. Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1% increase in yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7% decrease in applied N. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.",

    "abstract": "Crop models can support agricultural decisions, yet their reliability is necessarily limited when they do not sufficiently represent the complexity and specific circumstances of the target system. In some cases, models have such prohibitively high data requirements that they are only applicable with far-reaching and often questionable assumptions. In this paper, we demonstrate a customizable solution-oriented approach for crop modelling in situations where data and resources are limited. To address system complexity and produce a probabilistic crop model that does not depend on precise data, we used participatory analysis to describe system components using individual Bayesian networks that formalize expert knowledge into probabilistic causal relationships among important variables. We then used these Bayesian networks to generate inputs for a Monte Carlo model that illustrates the determinants of crop growth and simulates plausible ranges of expected grain and biomass yields at various stages of crop development. The resulting model accounts for all important variables and their interactions, as examined by local and foreign experts and described in relevant literature. We describe how to develop and customize such a model to specific situations based on case studies related to flood-based farming systems in Ethiopia and Kenya. The model assesses the performance of cropping systems and individual crops, and identifies factors of high importance for system outcomes. This approach to crop modelling paves the way for new opportunities to support agricultural decisions, since it does not require perfect information and can accommodate system complexity and uncertainty in data-poor environments.",

    "abstract": "Reducing N surplus from agriculture without compromising yield and quality requires economically and ecologically viable solutions. Based on field data, we investigated a technical and market-based solution to balance the economic and environmental performance of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in winter wheat in Switzerland. The technical solution, i.e. variable rate (VR) technology, was compared to the standard uniform fertilizer application (ST) in terms of revenues and N balance over seven site-years between 2018 and 2020. The potential of a market-based solution to align revenues and N surplus was investigated based on the relationship between two indicators: the economic optimum (EO) of the revenues and the balanced N supply (BNS). The EO was estimated using a production function approach. The BNS was empirically defined as the point at which the N surplus estimated from total N input (N fertilizer + soil N supply) reaches a limit value of 30 kg N ha−1. On average, the revenues of VR were about 4% higher than in ST. The N surplus was, on average, 32% (21 kg N ha−1) lower in VR compared with ST due to a 13% reduction in N inputs with no significant differences in yield. Despite the differences across years and fields, VR appeared to be reducing N surplus without losses in revenues in 5 out of 7 site-years. The revenue curve reached an EO at total N input of 205, 249 and 246 kg N ha−1, in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The BNS was calculated at 220, 195, and 178 kg N ha−1 N inputs for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The results show that a price increase of up to 5.4 times the current fertilizer price through taxes would be necessary in order to reduce the N surplus to an environmentally friendly level. Such an increase would hardly be politically feasible. The reported data showed that VR technology appears as a viable solution for producing lower N surplus at comparable revenue levels, thereby making it an option for small- to medium-scale winter wheat production in Switzerland. The environmental benefit could encourage the financial support of technologies for precise N management, which are often too expensive for these systems. Future research should verify or extend the numeric values found in this study.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Current food systems account for approximately 30 % of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; therefore, consumers' dietary preferences can have strong environmental consequences. This is well known for the GHG mitigation achieved by reducing animal protein consumption and associated methane emissions. However, the impact of diet shifts on the soil GHG balance has not been comprehensively evaluated yet. OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively assess the impact of the EAT-Lancet healthy diet on the net soil GHG balance at a national level with an advanced process-based modelling framework, using Denmark as a case study. METHODS: We adopted a two-sided approach. Firstly, we used the economic general equilibrium model MAGNET to quantify the demand-driven changes in food consumption and land use at the national level following the adoption of the EAT-Lancet healthy diet for the European Union (EU). We then used the DayCent process-based biogeochemical model to assess the implications of these changes for the GHG balance of agricultural soils at a national scale in Denmark. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that, compared to business-as-usual diets, the full adoption of the EAT-Lancet reference diet would cause significant carbon losses (up to 480 Gg CO2e y−1) and increased N2O emissions (2.1 % representing 50 Gg CO2e y−1) from 2030 to 2100 in agricultural soils. These changes primarily stem from the reduction in animal manure application to soil and a decrease in the share of permanent grasslands. The soil GHG balance differed largely across pedo-climatic conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: Although these results do not cancel the GHG reductions achieved by reducing livestock production (1390 Gg CO2e y−1), they underscore the importance of comprehensively accounting for soil GHG emissions as they offset some of the benefits of adopting a plant-based healthy diet. Finally, the marked regional variation in net soil GHG balances highlights the need for spatially explicit assessments in other regions and at larger scales.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT The increasing competition for land calls for new perspectives on land-use efficiency. Prioritisation must be discussed, as scientists and policymakers focus on food security with reduced environmental harm. Some farms with dairy cattle may not be resource-inefficient when compared to plant-based production, as generally believed, if the farm purpose and type(s) of land used are considered. OBJECTIVE This study aims to provide nuanced and often ignored perspectives on agricultural land-use efficiency and the ways this is assessed, through situated analysis of organic farms with dairy cattle. It considers landscape characteristics, farm designs, land uses, food outputs, weather conditions, and farmer considerations and motivations, to produce context-dependent land-use insights. METHODS Using detailed data from four organic case-farms, we quantified the total land use and food output at the farm gate and estimated the land-based feed-food competition through a land-use ratio (LUR). The LUR was used to compare current animal-based or mixed production outputs to potential plant-based food outputs from the same area, while maintaining an organic perspective. The quantitative results were qualified by insights from farmers and observations from multiple farm visits. The characteristics of the analysed farms were A) dairy production on marginal soils, B) regenerative grass-based dairy production, C) feed-no-food mixed livestock-crop system, and D) high-yielding dairy farm with crop production. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results showed how a feed-no-food mixed livestock-crop production (C) or dairy production primarily supported by land unsuited for food crop cultivation (A) can be as or more land-use efficient and have lower feed-food competition than a high yielding dairy production (D). The conclusions on efficiency were strongly influenced by the measuring unit, underlying assumptions on what constitutes a healthy agro-ecosystem as well as the fluctuations between years. Most important for the conclusion was the characteristics of the used land, the share of land use assessed suitable for cultivation, and the assumed yields for the estimated alternative pure plant-sourced food productions. Through the situated and mixed method perspectives, we furthermore showed how other relations such as flows of nutrients, nature-care, landscape development and farmers' considerations are relevant. SIGNIFICANCE Combining quantitative estimations with qualitative knowledge about farmers and their landscapes bring relations that are often ignored from similar studies into the analyses and provides a nuanced basis for discussion of the relevance of dairy cattle in future food production systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a multistep modeling approach for studying optimal management of fertilizer inputs in a situation where soil nitrogen and carbon dynamics and water and atmosphere externalities are considered. The three steps in the modeling process are: (1) generation of the data sets with a detailed simulation model; (2) estimation of the system models from the data; (3) application of the obtained dynamic economic optimization model considering inorganic and organic fertilizer inputs. We demonstrate the approach with a case study: barley production in southern Finland on coarse and clay soils. Our results show that there is a synergy between climate change mitigation and water protection goals, and a trade-off between pollution mitigation and crop production goals. If a field is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an insignificant source of water pollution, atmospheric externalities dominate the water externalities, even for a relatively low social cost of carbon (SCC). If a field is a significant source of water pollution, the SCC would have to be very high before atmospheric externalities dominate water externalities. In addition, an integrated nutrient management system appears better than a system in which only inorganic or organic fertilizer is used, although manure is not a solution to agriculture's GHG emissions problem. Moreover, GHG emissions and nitrogen and carbon leaching mitigation efforts should first be targeted at coarse soils rather than clay soils, because the marginal abatement costs are considerably lower for coarse soils.",

    "abstract": "For high latitude countries like Norway, one of the biggest challenges associated with greenhouse production is the limited availability of natural light and heat, particularly in winters. This can be addressed by changes in greenhouse design elements including energy saving equipment and supplemental lighting, which, however, also can have a huge impact on investments, economic performance, resources used and environmental consequences of the production. The study aimed at identifying a greenhouse design from a number of feasible designs that generated highest Net Financial Return (NFR) and lowest fossil fuel use for extended seasonal (20th January to 20th November) and year-round tomato production in Norway using different capacities of supplemental light sources as High Pressure Sodium (HPS) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED), heating from fossil fuel and electricity sources and thermal screens by implementing a recently developed model for greenhouse climate, tomato growth and economic performance. The model was first validated against indoor climate and tomato yield data from two commercial greenhouses and then applied to predict the NFR and fossil fuel use for four locations: Kise in eastern Norway, Mære in mid Norway, Orre in southwestern Norway and Tromsø in northern Norway. The CO2 emissions for natural gas used for heating the greenhouse and electricity used for lighting were calculated per year, unit fruit yield and per unit of cultivated area. A local sensitivity analysis (LSA) and a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) were performed by simultaneously varying the energy and tomato prices. Across designs and locations, the highest NFR for both production cycles was observed in Orre (116.9 NOK m−2 for extended season and 268.5 NOK m−2 for year-round production). Fossil fuel was reduced significantly when greenhouse design included a heat pump and when extended season production was replaced by a year-round production. The results show that the model is useful in designing greenhouses for improved economic performance and reduced CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use under different climate conditions in high latitude countries. The study aims at contributing to research on greenhouse vegetable production by studying the effects of various designs elements and artificial lighting and is useful for local tomato growers who either plan to build new greenhouses or adapt existing ones and in policy formulation regarding incentivizing certain greenhouse technologies with an environmental consideration or with a focus on increasing local tomato production.",

    "abstract": "Extensive livestock farms in the EU operate in a context of increasing market liberalization and competition, changing consumer patterns and decreasing meat consumption, and increasing climate change-related risks. In turn, EU policy calls for better supporting extensive systems due to their numerous socio-ecological benefits and aims to improve the resilience of extensive livestock farms. The research question underlying this paper is: which resilience capacities may help livestock farmers deal with different types of challenges? The specific research objectives are: 1) to quantify the resilience capacities of robustness, adaptability and transformability and the challenges as perceived by farmers; 2) to identify the main challenges affecting the perceived resilience capacities; and 3) to evaluate how perceived resilience capacities perform under alternative scenarios. The paper relies on the use of data from a survey of 120 cattle and sheep farmers in Spain to study the latent property of resilience through farmers' perception. The methodology consists of mixed statistical methods to address the three specific objectives. First, descriptive statistics to quantify the perceived resilience capacities and challenges threatening farming systems; second, fitting Partial Least Square regressions to identify the main challenges affecting robustness, adaptability and transformability; and third, stochastically simulate challenging scenarios to predict the behavior of the three resilience capacities under different types of challenges. Resilience capacities perform in different manners when dealing with challenges. Adaptability and transformability seem to be more effective under socio-economic long-term pressures. Robustness performs poorly under challenges either in the short- or long-run and appears to be more effective against economic and environmental challenges. Institutional challenges are the main threats to resilience, especially when it comes to reduced subsidies, restricted access to land, and subsidies-induced competition. The paper's contribution consists of the empirical advances in understanding the resilience capacities and their ability to deal with different types of challenges, about which the literature offers little guidance. To this end, the paper proposes a quantitative methodological solution that is relevant considering the need for methodological progress towards resilience quantifications. Lastly, the paper may inform policymaking by bringing new evidence into the debate on the future of extensive livestock in the EU based on the case of Spanish cattle and sheep farms.",

    "abstract": "Livestock production contributes to food security and livelihood improvement globally but places a significant burden on the environment. In Ireland, an ongoing transition towards highly profitable dairy production after the phasing out of EU milk quotas has changed the composition of the national cattle herd with more dairy and fewer beef cows. This shift impacts greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting across different cattle cohorts, e.g. increasing the proportion of calves from the dairy herd. Dairy x beef crossbreeds (DxB) increasingly contribute to national beef output, leveraging larger average daily liveweight gain (ADG) traits from beef breeding bulls. Prospective modelling of climate and land consequences arising from alternative cattle production strategies requires more accurate simulation of cohort-specific ADG and associated feed requirements and GHG emissions. A new COHORTS model was developed to improve national climate scenario mitigation modelling. COHORTS is capable of simulating 21 genetics-gender-age cohorts calibrated to Irish performance, using just a few basic input parameters (at minimum dairy- and beef-cow numbers). A cohort specific ADG and average standing liveweight is estimated for each genetic (pure dairy calves, DxB and pure beef calves), gender and age combination, enabling more accurate calculation of energy requirements and enteric fermentation emissions based on IPCC Tier 2 calculations. National simulation of cattle numbers, enteric fermentation emissions and beef outputs were validated against relevant Irish inventories. For the period between 2006 and 2020, simulations resulted in total cattle numbers, emissions and beef production within 4%, 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, of officially reported data. Our results indicate that climate projections based on average emission factors for pre-adult cattle cohorts may overestimate emissions in scenarios with projected growing dairy calf numbers and declining beef calf numbers. Validation using a 15-year data time series provides a high degree of confidence that COHORTS can be used to represent future herd dynamics in a wide range of scenarios, supporting robust policy regarding GHG mitigation, livestock production and land use – distinguishing between different levels of dairy or beef specialisation and across different levels of performance to predict forage (land) requirements and GHG emissions more accurately. COHORTS can be easily adapted for other countries, even when limited data are available.",

    "abstract": "Farmers in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region face several interrelated challenges including natural resource depletion, low crop productivity, and food and nutrition insecurity. To address some of these challenges, governments are considering different incentives to increase crop production. However, incentives often entail trade-offs and may have diverging effects on economic, social, and environmental sustainability. This study assessed the ex-ante effects of incentives targeted towards increasing crop production on the production and consumption decisions of farm households on the Saïss plain of northern Morocco. The assessment was conducted with a dynamic, intertemporal farm household model that simulates farm production and food consumption decisions. The model was calibrated using survey data from 85 farm households for 2014. Four scenarios were codesigned with local stakeholders and then simulated over a continuous 15-year period to capture rainfall variability: (1) increased availability of annual groundwater for irrigated cropping from 31 m3 ha−1 to 215 m3 ha−1, (2) a 15% increase in grain prices for cereals and legumes, (3) introduced drought tolerant crop varieties, and (4) a fourth scenario that combines all factors in the above three scenarios. Our results showed that regardless of the scenario, the area of cereals and legumes cultivated only slightly changed compared to the Baseline scenario. However, according to the scenarios tested, the total production of cereals increased by 10% to 21% and of legumes increased by 2% to 9%. This production increase is the direct consequence of increased crop yields due to an intensification of crop production methods. The incentives increased the consumption of cereals and legumes by up to 43%. This increase was mainly due to a shift from grain to vegetable production that increases cash income, resulting in more food purchases from the market while consumption from own production dropped by up to 53%. The average increase in crop income was 14% in scenarios 1–3 and 28% in scenario 4. However, increased income had ramifications for nature resource stocks, with irrigation water use from groundwater increasing by 593% in the Water scenario and 320% in the combined scenario, relative to the Baseline scenario. In the Water scenario, incomes increased by 15% and nitrogen leached increased by 36%, highlighting the trade-off between economic and environmental sustainability. These results show the challenges in obtaining acceptable compromises between the three sustainability pillars as the scenarios increased income but also led to increased groundwater extraction and nitrate leaching.",

    "abstract": "Integration of farms into markets with adoption of maize as a cash crop can significantly increase income of farms of the developing world. However, in some cases, the income generated may still be very low and maize production may also have strong negative environmental and social impacts. Maize production in northern Laos is taken as a case to study how far can farms' performance be improved with improved crop management of maize with the following changes at field level: good timing and optimal soil preparation and sowing, allowing optimal crop establishment and low weed infestation. We compared different farm types' performance on locally relevant criteria and indicators embodying the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, economic and social). An integrated assessment approach was combined with direct measurement of indicators in farmers' fields to assess eleven criteria of local farm sustainability. A bio-economic farm model was used for scenario assessment in which changes in crop management and the economic environment of farms were compared to present situation. The farm model was based on mathematical programming maximizing income under constraints related to i) household composition, initial cash and rice stocks and land type, and ii) seasonal balances of cash, labour and food. The crop management scenarios were built based on a diagnosis of the causes of variations in the agronomic and environmental performances of cropping systems, carried out in farmers' fields. Our study showed that moderate changes in crop management on maize would improve substantially farm performance on 4 to 6 criteria out of the 11 assessed, depending on farm types. The improved crop management of maize had a high economic attractiveness for every farm type simulated (low, medium and high resource endowed farms) even at simulated production costs more than doubling current costs of farmers' practices. However, while an improvement of the systems performance was attained in terms of agricultural productivity, income generation, work and ease of work, herbicide leaching, improved soil quality and nitrogen balance, trade-offs were identified with other indicators such as erosion control and cash outflow needed at the beginning of the cropping season. Using farm modelling for multicriteria assessment of current and improved maize cropping systems for contrasted farm types helped capture main opportunities and constraints on local farm sustainability, and assess the trade-offs that new options at field level may generate at farm level.",

    "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is among the most important staple food crops in the lowland Terai region of Nepal. However, national production has not matched the increasing demand. From a South Asian regional perspective, average productivity is low with high spatial and temporal variability. This study determines entry points for closing yield gaps using multiple diagnostic approaches, i.e., field surveys, on-farm experiments, and simulation models across different wheat production environments in the Terai region of Nepal. Yield and production practice data were collected from 1745 wheat farmers' fields and analysed in tandem with over 100 on-farm experiments. These were complemented by long-term simulation modeling using the APSIM Next Generation to assess system production behavior over a range of climate years. On-farm survey data suggests that yield and profit gaps under farmers' management (difference between the most productive (top 10th decile) and average wheat fields) were 1.60 t ha−1 and 348 USD ha−1 in the Terai region. The potential yield gap (difference between simulated potential yield and surveyed population mean) estimated was 4.63 t ha−1, suggesting ample room for growth even for the highest-yielding fields. Machine learning diagnostics of survey data, and on-farm trials identified nitrogen rate, irrigation management, terminal heat stress, use of improved varieties, seeding date, seeding method, and seeding rate as the principal agronomic drivers of wheat yield. While fields in the top 10th decile yield distribution had higher fertilizer use efficiencies and irrigation and seeding rates with similar overall production costs as average-yielding farmers. Our results suggest a complementary set of agronomic interventions to increase wheat productivity among lower-yielding farms in the Terai including advancing the time of seeding by 7–10 days on average, increasing nitrogen fertilizer by 20 kg ha−1, and alleviating water stress by applying two additional irrigations. Although wheat yields in the Terai are among the lowest in the region, biophysical production potential is high and remains largely untapped due to sub-optimal agronomic management practices rather than intrinsic agroecological factors. Data from this study suggests that incremental changes in these practices may result in substantial gains in productivity and profitability.",

    "abstract": "Cropping system models can be used to both assess regional food security and to monitor and predict agricultural drought. Agriculture in Kenya is extremely important to both the economy and food security of the country. This study evaluated a regional implementation of a widely used crop model, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), within a coupled modeling framework, the Regional Hydrologic Extremes Assessment System (RHEAS), over Kenya. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of RHEAS to simulate the annual variability of maize yields at the county level and evaluate the uncertainty inherent in the model and inputs. The RHEAS system implements a stochastic ensemble approach to account for field scale variabilities in crop management practices and underlying soil and weather conditions. Satellite-derived datasets were used to evaluate the land surface component of the system and seasonally disaggregated yield for 5 years was used to assess the performance of the cropping system model. The median correlation between RHEAS and satellite-derived soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates were 0.78, and 0.51, respectively, indicating that the model is able to capture the key drivers of the hydrological budget. Overall, RHEAS simulated yearly yield variations with a median correlation of 0.7 with reported yields, with the best performance in the short rains season. However, across both seasons, the RHEAS model was positively biased on the order of ∼1.6 MT/ha. The overall median unbiased RMSE was 0.66 MT/ha. The RHEAS system shows skill at simulating extreme departures in anomalies, and a majority of the time (62.5%) the reported yields fall within the interquartile range of the simulations. One of the most important areas of improvement for the next generation of agricultural data and models is to better understand and communicate the inherent uncertainties. This is especially critical in data-limited regions. Here we present a modeling system and its implementation that begins to address these concerns. We demonstrate the ability to simulate broad trends in yields at the county level for sub-annual yields with skills that commensurate previous national/annual level studies.",

    "abstract": "Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) harvest is ideally scheduled to avoid rain damage to the cut forage while it is still in the field. The problem of timing alfalfa harvest in relation to available weather forecasts is addressed here using a dynamic programming approach. The modeled cutting decision is faced daily, and it must balance increasing yield and decreasing forage quality if cutting is deferred, with potential weather-related losses evaluated using probability forecast information for the upcoming 24-h period. Specific results for central New York conditions produce a four-cut system in most years, and indicate that alfalfa preservation as wilted silage is probably preferable to either direct-cut silage or dry hay. Using weather forecasts to schedule alfalfa cutting is estimated to increase average annual crop value by about 5–10%, while decreasing income variability.",

    "abstract": "Each month the JRC issues the MARS Bulletin detailing the agro-meteorological and expert analysis underpinning the assessment of European crops' status and yield forecasts. In this context a resume is provided to give an overview on the geographical distribution of eventual crop damages. The MARS Bulletin provides such information in a set of synthetic maps (Areas of Concern), produced in each Bulletin, depicting extreme weather events and their impact on crops that have occurred in Europe during the analysis period. The present article describes the mix of quantitative and qualitative datasets and methodologies that drive the delineation of the Areas of Concern (AOC) maps and evaluates their capability to resemble crop production losses. The quantitative analysis is based on the Mars Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) indicators coming from meteorological models, crop growth models and remote sensing data. Indicators are considered in absolute and relative terms and in their relation with standard statistical metrics. The outcome of the quantitative analysis is a set of potential Areas of Concern. Experts' judgment is thus necessary to discriminate potential results through a qualitative analysis focused on: past occurred events and climatologic conditions; agro-management practices; regional agricultural systems peculiarity and their historical resilience and resistance to adverse conditions. In this article the experts' judgment of the team of current MARS analysts, as used in the AOC analysis, is translated into a warning index. Such index condenses the specific contribution to the final production of each development stage and the adverse agrometeorological events occurred, as depicted into the AOC maps. The warning index is computed at country scale for the past five agricultural seasons, from season 2011-2012 to season 2015-2016. Two crops are considered, winter wheat and grain maize as proxy for winter and summer crop groups. The warning indexes calculated are then compared to the national production in a qualitative way. To support the analysis few study cases are presented. The findings of this article highlight that the events depicted in the AOC maps are informative about production losses and specific knowledge is needed to full understand the information carried.",

    "abstract": "Carrying capacity is a fundamental concept in rangeland science and management; however, it is difficult to define, not least because it can be viewed from varied perspectives. With a view to facilitating debate, six perspectives (or definitions) of carrying capacity were formulated, representing: resource productivity; animal production; the system; animal welfare; the environment; and profit. To explore their implications semiquantitatively, Noy-Meir's simple, two-function model of a grazing system was used to simulate the annual herbage production cycle, during which a specified animal population density would be present year-round, except during an early-season grazing deferment of specified duration. The model was extended to calculate a metric for each definition of carrying capacity and then implemented for various combinations of the two key grazing-management-determined parameters: animal density and deferment duration. The metrics were mapped as a series of response surfaces. In general, grazing deferment at the start of the growth season can compensate for an increase in animal density. In other words, carrying capacity is, for most definitions, a contour line on a response surface; it divides the total space into \"acceptable\" and \"unacceptable\" regions of grazing-management practice. The contour lines that characterize the various carrying-capacity definitions can then be superimposed to examine the degree of overlap between \"acceptable\" regions. Two common rules-of-thumb for determining carrying capacity are examined by using this approach. The term \"carrying capacity\" is vague because it can address various concerns, but some of the most important concerns can be defined in reasonably precise terms and translated into quantitative metrics, based on the fundamental states and rates of a grazing system. Such an approach could facilitate dialogue among those concerned with the continuous refinement of carrying-capacity recommendations. • Carrying capacity is defined in six ways and assigned quantitative metrics. • A response surface is shown for each, based on animal density and deferment length. • On each response surface, carrying capacity is delineated by a contour line. • Early-season grazing deferment can compensate for an increase in animal density. • Superimposing contour lines helps illustrate areas of compatibility and conflict.",

    "abstract": "Regenerating the planet through natural resource protection, restoration and prudent land management must currently be one of the most important policy and operational objectives at all scales from local to international level. The beef cattle production sector has both an important role and a responsibility to this end as well. We estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of a cow over her entire life inclusive of that of her offspring taking cognisance of her physiological stages under different scenarios relative to the meat produced (carcass weight) to determine the range of emissions and/or sinks that are possible from a grassland beef cattle farming operation in South Africa. We constructed a system dynamics model populated by the energy and carbon flows of a hypothetical cow and her 8 offspring over their entire life cycle of 154 months. The birth of the cow and her offspring represents a marginal addition to an otherwise stable global herd. The cow and her calves thus constitute an additional carbon pool birthed and nurtured by the mature cow. By making provision for the physiological stages of the cow and her calves and allowing for typical variations in the metabolisable energy during these stages, we estimated the cumulative net greenhouse gas emissions relative to the cumulative amount of meat (carcass weight) produced. Using a purpose-built system dynamics model, we modelled several scenarios providing a range of outcomes depending on the parameter values. On the one end of the spectrum, we applied a global warming potential (GWP100) of methane of 28 and that 10% of the carbon contained in the manure is sequestered in the soil. Under this scenario the cumulative net emissions are estimated as 19.1 tCO2e per ton meat. Thus, the sources of emissions exceed the sinks. At the other end of the spectrum the figure turns into a net sink of approximately 12.6 tCO2e if a global warming potential (GWP*) of 8 is used and if 70% of the carbon in the manure is sequestered in the soil, a figure attainable in healthy soils with active microbial life and sufficient grass cover and good land management. Under these conditions the net addition of the cow and her calves to an otherwise stable global herd lead to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. All these figures exclude additional carbon sequestration through accelerated grass regrowth and increased litter deposits and could thus be deemed conservative. Discussions with respect to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock must consider the full life cycle of the female animal and her offspring, inclusive of the virtual (or embedded) carbon, the appropriate estimate of the global warming potential of methane acknowledging that it is a short-lived climate pollutant, as well as the condition of the rangelands. Much more effort should therefore be directed towards improving the soil and land use management, including incentive measures and knowledge sharing, as it has a mutually reinforcing impact on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and the sequestration of carbon.",

    "abstract": "Swiss mountains and lowlands feature different climatic and topographic conditions for agricultural production. Thus, farmers developed a collaborative dairy production scheme, where they take advantage of the specific environment of the two regions. In this contract rearing system, the young stock is reared on a mountain farm and the more intensive milk production is performed in the lowlands. This system is an example for the principle of comparative advantage, where each region focuses on the activity where it has the lowest opportunity costs. We hypothesised that the same principle can also be applied in an environmental context, to reduce the environmental impacts of agricultural production. Based on the life cycle assessments of average dairy farms, we could show that the absolute environmental impact was higher on mountain farms for both, the production of one heifer for restocking and the production of one kg milk. However, they had a comparative environmental advantage for rearing, as the young stock was better suitable for their local conditions than the dairy cows. Therefore, milk produced in collaboration between lowland and mountain farms had an up to 4.5% lower non-renewable energy demand and used up to 30.9% less potassium and up to 5.2% less phosphorus resources compared to non-collaborative production. Further consequences of collaboration were a reduced workload and income on mountain farms, and a potentially increased income on lowland farms. We conclude that the principle of comparative environmental advantage is appropriate as a screening method to identify suitable production systems for less favoured regions. However, the total effects of a possible division of labour among regions need to be assessed in a more holistic way where possible side-effects on other aspects are considered as well.",

    "abstract": "The notion of simply transfering agricultural innovation from suppliers to receivers as a strategy to improve agri-food systems globally has been strongly criticized and has raised debates in the field of agricultural technology development and innovation. Previous studies have shown that there is translational work to be done within agricultural innovation systems when technologies travel from one context to another, and they have also increasingly focused on how public research and technology institutions (PRTIs) participate in such efforts. However, previous literature has not sharpened such translation roles played by PRTIs into local innovation systems to interpret and adapt foreign agricultural technologies. This study aims to analyze translation roles played by Embrapa (a pivotal PRTI in Brazil) into the innovation system linked to Brazilian pig production. It analyses how Embrapa took part in the decontextualization and recontextualization of the pyramid model and hybrid pigs in the Brazilian setting. This study applies a qualitative research approach based on a case study method. Its primary data sources are 21 in-depth interviews with key actors involved with Brazilian pig production. Furthermore, interviewee's content was triangulated with secondary data and interpreted using our conceptual understanding as an analytical lens. Our findings add to theory on agricultural technology development and innovation systems in threefold way: 1) we show that PRTIs get involved in what we dub 'translation ecosystems' when helping to interpret and adapt imported innovations; 2) we uncover that PRTIs may present a 'translation flexibility' and perform more than a single translation role simultaneously within translation ecosystems; and 3) we propose more fine-grained translation roles (orchestrator and supporter) by observing how Embrapa contributed to translation ecosystems functioning. This study enhances previous knowledge on how PRTIs can better deal with global flows of knowledge and traveling of innovation. It also evidences that PRTIs should be highly regarded in terms of how to approach imported innovations in terms of scaling readiness as they can perform pivotal functions to assist actors who may become marginalized by innovations from abroad, by providing options that suit local contexts.",

    "abstract": "Crop diversity contributes to the resilience of agroecosystems by enhancing their capacity to adapt to perturbations. Farmers' access to crop planting material and information required for their, is crucial as it allows farmers to maintain a high level of crop diversity and adapt their crop portfolio to the changing social-ecological context. Despite their presumed importance for the resilience of small farms, the processes that influence farmers' access to the planting material of new crops and the information associated have rarely been studied. Our aim was to analyze the social networks that Betsimisaraka farmers in Madagascar use to access planting material and associated information. This would advance our understanding of the processes involved in the transformation of these agroecosystems into diversified agroforests that confer more resilience to local farming systems. We compare the networks of clove and vanilla, whose cultivation in the area expanded in recent decades, with the network of banana, a traditionally cultivated crop. We conducted an exhaustive survey of 98 households in a village on Madagascar's northeast coast to gather data on the farmers' access to clove, vanilla and banana planting material and information concerning their cultivation. We analyzed the differences and similarities between the three networks, in particular the types of relationship mobilized, the nature of kinship ties, and the geographical extent of networks. Our results show that the studied networks include both weak bridging ties over long distances that give the farmers access to crops that were rarely cultivated in the area until recently (vanilla), and strong local ties that facilitate farmers' access to crops that are broadly cultivated locally (clove and banana). Major differences were found in the nature of ties used by farmers to access planting material and relevant information for these different crops. The implications of the network characteristics observed for the resilience of the farming systems are discussed. Our study underlines the importance of taking local modes of access to crop diversity and associated information into consideration to enhance the development of biodiversity-based resilient agriculture. We recommend that the local social processes that drive this access should be fully integrated in development and adaptation programs.",

    "abstract": "Faced with incomplete and imperfect information, economic actors rely predominantly on perceptions and often base decisions on heuristics prone to bias. Gender bias in perceptions favoring men has been found in a variety of settings and may be an important reason why some sectors remain dominated by men and gender gaps in terms of benefits persist. In modernizing food supply chains in a patriarchal context such as the maize sub-sector in Uganda, this may result in women facing significant barriers to entry. Using a unique dataset of ratings of agro-input dealers provided by smallholder farmers in their vicinity, we test if farmers perceive male-managed agro-input shops differently than agro-input shops managed by women. We use a dyadic dataset of farmer-dealer links to explicitly control for quality differences between male- and female-managed agro-input shops and use the fact that a farmer has generally rated more than one agro-input to account for farmer-level heterogeneity using fixed-effects regression. We find that farmers rate male-managed agro-input outlets higher on a range of attributes related to the dealership in general, as well as on the quality of inputs sold by the dealer. After controlling for both dealer and farmer level confounders, we conclude that gender bias in customer perceptions persists. Our results suggest a comparative disadvantage and an important entry barrier for female agro-input dealers. The gender bias may also affect social outcomes like women's capabilities, aspirations, and empowerment in seed systems but also impairs development at more aggregate levels: as a considerable share of agro-input shops is managed by women, this finding may impose challenges for varietal turnover, hindering agricultural productivity, food security, and rural transformation. Policies and interventions designed to challenge gender norms and customs are needed to correct this bias.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture plays a vital role in African countries, driving economic growth, employment, and non-agricultural sector improvements. However, persistent food insecurity and poverty among smallholder families raise concerns. Land fragmentation compounds these issues, limiting agricultural productivity and pushing farmers towards off-farm activities, despite Africa's potential agricultural markets. The study's focus is Donomadé, a remote village in southern Togo. This study pursues a dual objective. Firstly, it investigates how household characteristics, including family size and resource availability, influence farmers' resource management decisions. Secondly, the research employs serious games to comprehend farmers' livelihood strategy choices within constrained real-world-like conditions. The iterative and participatory Companion Modelling (ComMod) approach was utilized for the co-design and co-development of a serious game. This involved close collaboration with a local research team from the University of Lomé, a local NGO, and Donomadé village farmers. Various farming systems were characterized, and collective insights into Donomadé's agricultural dynamics were gathered through surveys, interviews, and workshops. Regardless of their in-game roles, farmers prioritize fulfilling basic family needs, such as food security and education instead of investing in agriculture. The study underscores the significance of household composition and resource availability when designing technology interventions or support mechanisms for farmers. Aligning interventions with farmers' overarching goals and challenges can enhance technology adoption. Furthermore, addressing food security remains crucial for sustainable development, as it not only improves human welfare and alleviates hunger but also forms the foundation for comprehensive solutions in the face of climate change, resource constraints, and population growth. This research highlights that heavy investment in agriculture is not the priority for many farmers in southern Togo, despite it being their main source of sustenance and income. Addressing immediate family needs, especially food security, education, and housing, takes precedence over long-term agricultural investments. Given the persistent challenge of food security amidst global uncertainties, addressing these priorities is paramount to stimulate more significant interest in agricultural investment.",

    "abstract": "Improving the productivity of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa is a key component in reducing poverty and increasing food security as crop production is a significant source of livelihood for the majority of the population. Still, crop yields show a huge variability in smallholder farming systems whose productivity is poorly measured and understood. In this work, we estimate maize (Zea Mays) yield gap in Southern Malawi (Phalombe district) and assess drivers of productivity gap under different socio-economic and biophysical contexts. We use a mixed-method approach which integrates multi-source datasets (including primary ground-truth data we collected in the maize growing season 2019–2020 and secondary remote-sensing data), empirical and process-based crop-growth models (AquaCrop) to calculate the water-limited yield gap. In addition, we analyse the relationship between the relative yield (defined as the actual yield observed at the farmers' plots normalised by the AquaCrop simulated water-limited potential yield) and possible socio-economic drivers which we collected through surveys administered to households iin the same season 2019–2020. We obtained a water-limited potential yield for the maize hybrid SC649 of 9.5 t/ha during the season 2019–2020 in the Malawian trial site. The observed actual yield at the households in the season 2019–2020 varied from 0.8 to 10.9 t/ha. The estimate of the yield gap ranged between 15% and 85% thus showing a large variability due to the high resolution, but low accuracy of the empirical model. Results suggest that with higher income and increased fertiliser application there is potential to increase the relative yield and that the marginal increase is spatially differentiated. Our spatially-explicit approach to yield-gap analysis is valuable in identifying high-productive areas and differentiated policy interventions aimed at closing the yield and income gaps for smallholder farmers.",

    "abstract": "Complex rice systems (CRS) are polycultures in which rice is grown together with one or more plant or animal species using combined methods of practices from indigenous knowledge and modern science in augmenting ecological processes to foster ecosystem services in rice agroecosystems. However, their implementation faces challenges due to farmers' knowledge gaps, high capital outlay and labour shortages. This study aims to link types of rice farming and farmer perceptions to facilitate recommendations to scale up CRS. We constructed a farm typology based on a survey of 111 farm households and aggregated cognitive maps (ACMs) based on fuzzy cognitive maps developed in focus group discussions in Malang and Lamongan, East Java Province, Indonesia. The farm typology classified farm households into three types: (a) small farms with high inputs of agrochemicals (SH, n = 29) which were all identified in Malang; (b) medium-size farms with high input intensity of agrochemicals (MH, n = 43), distributed across Malang and Lamongan; and (c) medium-size farms with low inputs of agrochemicals (ML, n = 39), all detected in Lamongan. ACMs revealed the differences in farmer group's perceptions on farm input-output relations, agroecosystems processes and CRS component interactions. SH and MH farmers prioritised economic benefits over ecosystem services and crop-livestock components. SH farmers were locked into high-input and high-output systems, while MH farmers failed to obtain high output despite high input use. Intervention schemes could be developed such as thorough training on economics for SH farmers and efficient use and on-farm production of fertilisers for MH farmers. Meanwhile, with the majority of ML farmers having adopted CRS, their priorities were more evenly distributed across all components, implying their more holistic understanding of the interacted components. However, technical assistance on agronomic, post-harvest management and marketing were still considered to be needed to ensure a long-term sustainability of CRS practices by ML farmers. Combining farm typology and fuzzy cognitive mapping could facilitate a comprehensive understanding of farming system types, their characteristics and farmer perceptions as a key to formulate appropriate interventions for a specific farm type. Therefore, these methodological approaches could provide guidance to accelerate transitions toward complex agroecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural innovations are inclusive when they are used by any member of society who wants to use them. Conversely, agricultural innovations that can only be used by a specific privileged group within society can be characterized as \"exclusive\". The first objective of this paper is to examine the inclusivity of agricultural innovations in Ethiopia, using national representative data and considering a wide portfolio of innovations resulting from the collaborative research between CGIAR and its national partners. Second, we also examine how measurement error may affect how we characterize the inclusivity of agricultural innovations. We use nationally-representative survey data from Ethiopia (collected in 2018/19) in which best-practice measures of the adoption of a large number of agricultural innovations were embedded, including the adoption of CGIAR-related improved maize varieties measured using two different approaches: subjective, self-reported survey data; and objective DNA fingerprinting of crop samples taken from the same farmers' plots. A rich set of household variables is also collected in the survey, which allows characterizing the types of farmers that are adopting different innovations, and the extent to which conclusions regarding the inclusivity of innovations depends on the measurement of the latter. Many innovations are not disproportionately more likely to be adopted by male, larger, richer, or more connected farmers. When using self-reported data on adoption of improved maize varieties, adoption appears positively correlated with having larger landholdings and households with lower female participation in agriculture, and negatively correlated with poorer households (being among the bottom 40% of consumption distribution). Substituting survey responses with the results of DNA fingerprinting these correlations disappear, with farm size, gender and poverty status no longer predictive of adoption. The results suggest the potential value of offering a menu of innovations to farmers to increase inclusivity, as it allows each farmer to be a critical consumer of potential innovations and select those that best correspond to their own needs and constraints. We also highlight how important data quality is in ensuring we have correct information about inclusive innovation.",

However, the methodological skills and prerequisites for successful living labs are not particularly well articulated. Based on our experience (five national and EU research projects) and our research backgrounds in (interdisciplinary) social science and participatory research, we highlight several risks associated with the use of living labs in agrifood studies without having the resources, reflectivity or skills required. These risks include: 1) imposing predefined agendas that are masked as participatory processes, 2) placing an overemphasis on confidentiality or knowledge sharing, and 3) getting lost in researcher roles. We argue that there is a need to discuss and improve understanding of these risks in order to produce successful living labs in agrifood studies, as well as avoid conceptual dilution or confusion.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how multiple factors interact in complex systems is an important issue. In particular, agricultural production systems are based on biological and ecological processes that are influenced by environmental and human factors, all of which interact. When evaluating such systems statistically, these multiple dependences and interactions make it more difficult to model system performances as a function of management practices and weather. Our objective was to assess interactions among management practices, weather and system performances. We aimed in particular to identify subsets of farms whose correlations for given pairs of variables as a function of another variable deviated greatly from the traditional correlation between the variables (i.e., atypical farms). We investigated a measure of dependence that assesses whether (and if so, how) the correlation between two variables varies as a function of a third one: conditional Kendall's tau. We applied this measure to a set of variables that described management practices (e.g., concentrated feed fed), weather (e.g., precipitation) and performances (e.g., milk production, enteric methane emissions) for dairy-cattle systems in France in 2013 and 2014 (2523 and 804 farms, respectively). In 2013, the amount of digestible organic matter in the ration ingested per cow influenced the correlation between milk production per cow and enteric methane emissions per livestock unit. In particular, the correlation was negative for a set of atypical farms whose ingested digestible organic matter was ≈ 2050-2900kg.cow−1. In addition, total annual precipitation in 2013 influenced the correlation between the amount of concentrated feed fed per cow and milk production per cow for farms surveyed in either year. In 2013 and 2014, the correlation began decreasing strongly beyond a certain threshold of precipitation (ca. 1400 and 1100 mm, respectively), which highlighted the need to adapt each farm's practices to its agricultural and weather context. Application of conditional Kendall's tau identified interactions that caused the effectiveness of management practices to vary and how they did so.",

    "abstract": "On pioneer fronts, the new spatial-temporal evolution of agriculture needs to be understood to help farmers find their way to conciliate food production and forest conservation. Analyzing farm trajectories is consequently critical for designing such futures and to assess their commitments with agroecology principles. Based on the analysis of the literature on farm trajectories and pathways we proposed a renewed analytical framework to analyze farm trajectories in pioneer fronts and support the identification of desirable strategies for the future. A systematic review adapted from the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was used. From an initial record of 246 papers, 81 were selected as eligible for the review. The articles were classified in six categories according to three criteria: i) the retrospective or prospective analysis of farm trajectories, ii) the consideration or not of the territorial scale (drawing lessons at territorial scale), iii) the use or not of modeling tools. We also explored whether off-farm factors (such as existing infrastructure at territorial scale or access to credit) and intra-farm factors (such as the organization of family work and the role of women within this organization) were considered since these factors affect farms trajectories in pioneer fronts. Results indicate that the concept of trajectory is mainly associated with retrospective analyses while the concept of pathway is mostly associated with prospective studies generally using simulation tools for the design of future scenarios. The link between trajectories and agroecological principles also has been little explored in the literature. Both retrospective and prospective studies fail to pay sufficient attention to the roles of women and family organization. Lastly, most of the methodologies studied do not fully consider the effects of off-farm territorial factors and public policies on these trajectories. We propose an analytical framework that would address these limitations. This framework is currently used in Brazilian and Colombian Amazon and will help defining sustainable farm trajectories limiting deforestation. Such a framework is needed to support farm development on pioneer fronts and broadly in territories that must deal with highly critical environmental agendas.",

    "abstract": "The semi-arid zone of Burkina Faso is characterized by strong climate variability and declining soil fertility associated with low biomass production. The main objective of this study was to identify key levers to improve biomass management in semi-arid Burkina Faso for diverse farm types. Farm diversity was captured with a statistical typology complemented by a participatory typology established with local farmers. Biomass management was described for the different farm types based on survey information obtained from 228 households across two villages. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) was conducted to represent biomass production strategies of each farm type. After a sensitivity analysis which revealed model robustness, scenario analysis was performed with the FCMs to explore farm type-specific options for alleviating biomass scarcity. Two contrasting scenarios were built based on observations and insights from the survey and focus group discussions with farmers and included (1) deliberate exchange of crop residue with manure, and (2) a subsidies policy allowing a reduction in prices of 30% for farm inputs coupled with increased off-farm revenue for the subsistence-oriented farms. The statistical typology identified four farm types, distinguishing between subsistence or market-oriented farms and crop or livestock-oriented production. The participatory typology partly confirmed these four main types, even though other criteria of distinction were given by farmers. Different farm types used contrasted strategies in biomass production and management which were mainly driven by the total cultivated area and the herd size. The farm type with the largest herd and smallest cultivated land was the only one to rely on grain inflow from outside the farm to meet its household food requirement. The inflow of crop residue was also largest for this farm type. In contrast, crop residue outflow was mainly observed for the subsistence-oriented crop farm type, which had the smallest fodder needs. The scenario analysis using FCM suggested that biomass exchange had a negligible effect on farm performance but that the subsidy and income diversification scenario positively impacted crop and livestock production, especially for the subsistence-oriented types. Our study pointed out that FCM is a useful tool to not only describe system dynamics but also to reveal levers for improvement through sensitivity and scenario analysis. These levers included income diversification (for subsistence farms especially), improved production and storage of forage (for large herd owners), and investment into equipment and better access to markets (for market-oriented farms).",

    "abstract": "The ruminant livestock sector is under scrutiny for its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Less Favoured Areas (LFA) carry a large proportion of Europe's cattle and sheep ruminant population and is also characterised by variable economic and biophysical constraints. This study aims to assess the heterogeneity in carbon emissions, resource usage and financial performance in a sample of mixed LFA livestock farms in Scotland. Individual farm account data for 263 LFA cattle and sheep producers were augmented with emissions data over the period 2019–2020. Environmental impacts were estimated for each farm using emissions intensity and carbon productivity. Technical efficiency at the farm level (the rate of output to total inputs) was estimated using non-parametric data envelopment analysis. Financial resilience was measured through returns on assets to meet short-term liquidities. To manage the heterogeneity in these indicators Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was employed. This allocates farms into separate groups, or profiles, representing different levels of environmental, resource efficiency and financial dimensions. To gain understanding of the drivers on membership of profiles we assess the impact of intensity and enterprise mix using multinomial logistic regression (MLN). Three profiles were identified within our sample which reflect different levels of performance; i) a best practice profile (23% of farms) have relatively low mean emissions intensities (22.3 kg CO2-eq./kg CW), high carbon productivity (£0.17 GVP/ kg CO2-eq.), high technical efficiencies and strong financial resilience; ii) a low resilience profile (31% of farms) which are the most economically fragile and susceptible to economic shocks, and iii) a high emissions profile (46% of farms) which have the lowest technical efficiencies and also the highest mean emissions intensities (31.9 kg CO2-eq./kg CW) and lowest carbon productivity (£0.10 GVP/ / kg CO2-eq.). The MLN identified that farms within the best practice profile will be more extensive compared to the other profiles. Less Favoured Areas dominate global agricultural systems and they offer a more heterogenous picture compared to more intensive lowland or feedlot cattle systems. Agricultural support payments are changing to reward public goods. Our approach sets realistic thresholds for higher level performance across multiple dimensions that may merit higher payments if an outcomes-based payment scheme were adopted.",

    "abstract": "In annual cropping systems at high latitudes, an early onset of winter limits the establishment of cover crops in fall and ultimately the ecosystem services they provide such as nitrogen (N) leaching reduction. Interseeding cover crops into a standing cash crop can improve establishment before winter, but its practice is limited in both scope and scale. To identify tradeoffs and establish regional patterns of interseeding success in the environmentally sensitive Chesapeake Bay Watershed of North America, we used the agroecosystem model Cycles to compare in silico systems in which cover crops were either interseeded into a standing crop of corn (Zea mays L.) or conventionally seeded after corn harvest. In each of the 153 counties contained in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, a representative field was simulated and either seeded with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), a blend of legumes, or a mix of legumes and ryegrass in a continuous corn sequence. The simulated corn yield, cover crop biomass production, N leaching reduction, and total N losses were compared between the cover crop scenarios and a monoculture corn control. Simulations showed that conventionally seeded cover crops did not affect corn yields of the following year. However, when interseeded, the drag on corn yield in the same year averaged 6% per Mg of fall cover crop biomass. The corn yield reduction notwithstanding, interseeding reduced N leaching by 10% for legumes, 25% for the mix, and 50% for solo ryegrass compared to the no cover-crop control. There are other tradeoffs, such as an offset of N fertilizer inputs from N2 fixation when using legumes despite the less effective nutrient capture. Regardless of the cover crop type, interseeding up to latitude 41° N tends to be competitive with the cash crop, but north of that threshold (or west into higher elevations) the mitigation of N leaching when interseeding seems to outweigh agronomic costs. This study provides useful insight into watershed-scale agronomic and environmental processes without the constraints of establishing large-scale networks of field trials. Given these analyses, future field research in areas suitable for interseeding can focus on establishing legume cover crops in high-yielding fields with low residual mineral N, grass cover crops in manured or low-yielding fields with residual mineral N, and a mixture of both when N supply is uncertain and preventive management is needed.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating opportunities to improve management is important for farmers seeking to operate profitable pasture-based dairy production systems. Digital technologies offer the prospect of increased automation on-farm and unprecedented amounts of data, including spatial data. The potential benefits of increased automation are more readily quantifiable than the benefits of more data. For data to be beneficial, it must provide the required information at the desired accuracy at the right time, leading to improved decision-making and farm outcomes. In pasture-based dairy production systems, management is complex, with both the requirements of the milking herd and forage growth fluctuating throughout the year. Measuring forage production regularly is recognised as important for the effective management of pasture-based systems. However, uptake of established measurement methods is limited, suggesting a disconnect between technical and practical feasibility and uncertainty about the value of measurement. This review focuses on the interface between digital forage measurement technologies and dairy farm systems. It aims to investigate the prospects of digital pasture measurement as an enabling technology to improve pasture and grazing management decisions and how it's contribution could be valued in dairy production systems. Published literature on pasture and grazing management decisions, including the role of information in decision-making and how it can be collected, were evaluated and considered along with theoretical frameworks and studies to examine how an approach to valuing digital pasture measurement technologies in dairy systems may be developed. This review found that published studies quantifying the economic benefit of pasture measurement are scarce. However, if relevant research in agronomy, social science and economics is used to inform the development of an integrated farm systems approach, the net benefits of digital pasture measurement could be appropriately valued. A farm systems approach would capture and quantify both the direct and indirect benefits and costs of applying the technologies on-farm. Direct benefits may arise from a reduction in cost of obtaining information needed for decision-making. Indirect benefits could arise from the application of new or more timely information to farmer decisions that result in improved pasture and grazing management outcomes. In this digital age where sensor technologies generate large volumes of data, methods to determine its utility and value are becoming increasingly important. Failure to establish and implement these methods could limit on-farm technology adoption or result in the measurement of parameters that are not economically important.",

    "abstract": "Sustained high yields of tea rely on the supply of nitrogen (N) from soil reserves, typically maintained by N fertilisation from inorganic or organic sources. This paper describes how soil N levels, including the effects of soil organic content and pH, were developed and incorporated into a crop yield simulation model called CUPPA-Tea. The nitrogen dynamics are presented in terms of i) the initial nitrogen stocks, ii) the addition of nitrogen to the system, iii) the uptake, use and loss of nitrogen by tea plants, and iv) nitrogen flows within the soil. CUPPA-Tea was then calibrated and validated using measured tea yields from Tanzania and Kenya. After integrating a wide range of nitrogen algorithms, the model explained 79% of the variation in annual yields within a nitrogen and irrigation experiment in Tanzania and a fertilizer experiment in Kenya. The slope of the relationship was 0.84 and 0.73 respectively, the root mean square error was 660 kg ha−1 and 507 kg ha−1, and the modelling efficiency was 0.77 and 0.75 respectively. The model predicted that in the absence of N application, tea yields would be higher from a site with a high rather than a low soil organic content. By contrast, at high levels of mineral N application, the yield response in the model was not sensitive to the soil organic content. Hence within the model, a site in Tanzania with a low soil organic content of 1.6% showed a greater yield response to applied mineral N than a site in Kenya where the soil organic carbon was 4.0%. The model also predicted small losses of N from the cropping system through denitrification and leaching due to the acidic soil conditions (pH < 4.5) and an assumed tea rooting depth between 300 and 500 cm. In Tanzania, irrigation was predicted to result in around 10% higher nitrogen uptake than under unirrigated conditions. The use of the CUPPA-Tea model can be useful in supporting decision making and improving the accuracy of tea yield estimates, as well as predictions of N fate within the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.",

    "abstract": "Area-wide collaboration across private and public property boundaries can enhance the management of weeds and minimise the spread of herbicide resistance. Yet we know little about the practices individual land managers engage in to achieve area-wide weed management (AWWM). This paper uses Social Practice Theory (SPT) as a framework to understand how cropping land managers engage with the practices of AWWM, and what the drivers and barriers are to their participation. 30 qualitative interviews were undertaken with land managers in Australian cropping regions of the Darling Downs (Queensland), Gwydir (New South Wales), Riverina (New South Wales) and Sunraysia (Victoria). Thematic analysis of the interviews explored the three dimensions of SPT—meanings, materials, and competences—of AWWM and the interactions between these elements. There is a value-action gap between growers' desire to participate in AWWM practices and their capacity to do so. The analysis reveals that narrowing this gap requires interventions at the points where the SPT elements intersect. It recommends beginning by leveraging existing commonalities between growers who already have a desire to participate in AWWM then scaling out by encouraging trusted agronomist networks to link diverse growers to facilitate collaborative weed management practices. There is also a role for government in supporting the development of leadership capabilities among growers, providing an enabling environment for agronomists to act as systemic facilitators and leading by example on public land. Most of the research on collective management of weeds has focused on formal groups in grazing systems. This study provides new insights into how and why weeds are largely managed independently in cropping systems and proposes ways growers may be supported to adopt more collaborative practices to address this landscape-scale problem.",

    "abstract": "In Guadeloupe, the use of a persistent pesticide (chlordecone) contaminated one third of the island's agricultural soils, causing a major environmental crisis. In the aftermath, banana farmers significantly changed their management practices to decrease their pesticide use. With the support of research, farmers have tested and adopted various agroecological practices, such as planting cover crops and using vitroplants and fallow. However, the use of animals to decrease pesticide use on banana plantations has not yet been explored. This study aimed to co-design agroecological cropping systems that integrate animals as an alternative means to manage weeds. The study was based on co-design workshops involving farmers, advisors and scientists, a survey of local practices of integrating animals within cropping systems, on-farm experiments with four farmers during which a total of 20 four-month-old male lambs were introduced within their cropping systems, and reflexive monitoring two and six months after the end of the experiments. The introduction of sheep into cropping systems was the option deemed the most promising after three co-design workshops. Animals already were integrated into some banana-based farming systems in the study area, but this integration mainly consisted of cattle grazing on fallow land. The on-farm experiments highlighted that sheep made it possible to reduce the herbaceous cover on banana plantations by almost 60%. The growth performance of the lambs allowed by the herbaceous cover was within the range observed for this breed when reared on pastures (50–139 g/day). In this experiment, the lambs were not reared for meat, since the animals were, unsurprisingly, contaminated by chlordecone. The farmers appreciated that the practice enabled them to eliminate a labor-intensive activity (removing by hand the vines around the banana pseudo-stem) and radically reduce brush cutting. Piloted by a technical institution providing farmers technical support, initial changes in the broader socio-technical regime were observed. This study highlights a co-design process of agroecological cropping systems involving agronomists, animal scientists, and farmers that led to an innovative, animal-based method of managing weeds within banana cropping systems with positive preliminary adoption outcomes as new farmers start using the practice. Inspired by similar efforts in vineyards, cereal and oil palm plantations, it is one of the first attempts to introduce sheep into banana cropping systems. The challenge is now to support this adoption at the territorial scale through possible cooperation between breeders and farmers, the training of farmers, and finding a means to ensure the safety of sheep.",

    "abstract": "The Project ‘Integrated Pest Management of Honduras’ based at the Panamerican School of Agriculture in Honduras, validates pest management techniques for resource-poor farmers in the region's primary subsistence crops, maize and beans. During the period covered by this study the project combined on-farm research with extension, in order to guarantee farmer-scientist-farmer information exchange and to test the transferability of technological recommendations. Each field team of BS-level agronomists, researchers and extensionists included one member who, although trained as an agronomist, also performed the work of a para-anthropologist. Using unobtrusive investigative techniques he gathered the kind of qualitative information about farmers' immediate reactions to the project which formal surveys cannot pick up. Without any formal training whatsoever in social sciences the agronomo-anthropologists made significant contributions to the development of the extension materials and improvement of communication with the farmers; the verification of farmers' actual rates of adoption and explanations for their variation; the simplification of the technology which the project was developing; and to a deeper understanding of socio-political dynamics internal to the farmers' groups, which decisively affected the project's results but could not be detected by formal interviews. The paper concludes that despite the limitation of BS agronomists, they can be very useful in proving feedback from farmers to project managers and to scientists conducting on-farm research.",

    "abstract": "Climbing beans offer potential for sustainable intensification in the East-African highlands, but their introduction requires a major change in the cropping system compared with the commonly grown bush bean. We explored farm-level opportunities, constraints and trade-offs for climbing bean cultivation in the eastern highlands of Uganda. We established current food self-sufficiency, income, investment costs and labour, and assessed the ex-ante, farm-level impact of four climbing bean options on these indicators. Input for this assessment were a detailed characterization of 16 farms of four types, and on-farm, experimental data of adaptation trials of climbing bean. Climbing beans generally improved food self-sufficiency and income, but often required increased financial investment and always demanded more labour than current farm configurations. Opportunities for integration of climbing beans on small farms were limited. Although some of the poorest farmers accrued the largest absolute benefits from climbing beans, their ability to make the necessary investments is questionable. The analysis was translated into a simple-to-use modelling tool to enable participatory analysis of the outcomes with farmers of the four farm types to understand their perspectives and decision-making. The discussions revealed a recent increase in market prices for climbing bean resulting in growing interest in their cultivation in the eastern highlands. A lack of seed and stakes was limiting climbing bean cultivation, and a sufficient amount of climbing bean seed needs to be ensured through strengthening of farmer cooperatives and improved storage.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus is a key irreplaceable nutrient that plays a major role in crop nutrition. The mineral form of phosphorus fertiliser is a mined resource and its supply comes predominantly from geopolitically sensitive parts of the world. A renewable source of phosphorus such as biosolids therefore offers a sustainable option. Nevertheless, continuous application of biosolids needs to be managed to ensure that soil is not saturated with nutrients which can then become a cause for concern in terms of enrichment of water bodies in the event of an erosion. Existing field trials have demonstrated the efficacy of biosolids as phosphorus fertiliser to meet crop demand whilst maintaining an environmentally safe amount in the soil. However, field trials are expensive, and an alternative would be a geospatial tool that builds on such information to act as a decision support tool to determine suitability of land to receive biosolids whilst ensuring that phosphorus levels are in environmentally safe limits. Thus, a novel and evidence-based decision support method for assessing land suitability for biosolids application at a national scale known as the Phosphate Acceptance Map (PAM) is described here. It provides a sound basis for addressing this need, layering over the model the means to capture a range of realistic scenarios, developed with industry practitioners, to allow exploration of the consequences of different land management strategies. The research method has involved the development and application of a modelling approach for phosphate acceptance, drawing from a collation of the core geographical and descriptive data themes required. These data describe both the environmental characteristics of the land under assessment, as well as the expression of nominal stakeholder values and protected areas. In considering the methods, it may be noted that the modelling drew upon key empirical data themes as a pragmatic approach. A number of key national datasets have been utilised such as the National Soil Map (Natmap), the 'National Soil Inventory' (NSI), geology and land use, as well as topography and prevailing climatic data. Demographic data was used to calculate potential arising nationally which was coupled together in the context of fertiliser recommendations. The issues addressed in the PAM modelling span borders and thus, where the data required is forthcoming, the methods demonstrated also have the potential to support wider application in other national contexts.",

    "abstract": "In systems design for livestock husbandry, the tendency is to focus on technical measures and to control the behaviour of animals in order to reduce complexity and make system functioning predictable, thereby often treating animals as agricultural objects. However, treating animals as agents and providing in opportunities for animal agency – defined as being able to control the (social and physical) environment through choice and decision-making by the animal based on individual preferences and demands – is recognized as being important in having positive experiences and in achieving good animal welfare. The opportunity of an animal to use one's capacities to control one's environment is important for the animal herself, and, at the same time, can contribute to the functioning of the system. We propose a design approach, Animal Capacities in Design (ACiD), that enables engineers of livestock systems to include animals' capacities into the design process and promotes more animal agency in the final design. The ACiD approach, which was partly developed through a series of workshops with engineers, involves the systematic and structured consideration of animal physiological, morphological and behavioural capacities as well as system functions and sub-functions in order to identify animal-based solutions. ACiD consists of different parts: a Brief of Capacities (BoC), BoC user guidelines, and BoC application instructions. The BoC is a design tool that provides an overview of capacities of a specific animal species, further specified and ordered by means of capacity attributes that provide additional information to understand and deploy these capacities in the design process. An attitude shift towards 'providing agency' instead of the currently dominant engineering paradigm of 'taking care of' is needed for successful application. ACiD stimulates this change in attitude through the inclusion of animal agency in the design goals, the set-up of an overview of requirements that includes positive welfare requirements, and it challenges engineers to (re)define functions in such a way that they allow for non-technical solutions enlarging the solution space for more active animal involvement. The ACiD approach facilitates and creates accessibility to relevant biological information for designers during the design process and aims to integrate the animal and her capacities in new and sustainable designs of livestock husbandry. The promise is a mutual beneficial relation between human goals and good animal welfare in future livestock husbandry systems.",

    "abstract": "Livestock are the primary source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture in most African countries, but there is a paucity of baseline data and monitoring of GHG emissions from livestock in Africa, particularly for extreme or shock events. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a novels shock to livestock systems and may result in indirect effects on livestock emissions and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the pandemic in 2020, extensive pastoralist livestock systems in Northern Kenya were subjected to restrictions on movement, increased costs of transportation, and closure of livestock markets. The objective of this study was to assess the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya using proxy data and a three-part framework based on changes in 1) herd size, 2) feed availability, and 3) livestock movement. We evaluated changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on proxy data from crowd-sourced market data, household panel surveys, and remote sensing data on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Proxy data were obtained before the pandemic in 2019 and after the pandemic in 2020 to compare between years and evaluate the indirect effects of the pandemic and associated restrictions on livestock GHG emissions using the three-part framework. Overall GHG emissions from livestock in Northern Kenya have decreased due to the pandemic and this was largely driven by reductions in herd size. This reduction in GHG emissions occurred despite an increase in GHG emissions from livestock associated with higher feed availability. Decreased livestock movement due to the pandemic contributed to reductions in GHG emissions from livestock, but such reductions were likely to be small due to limited need for livestock to travel longer distances under the prevailing conditions of high feed availability. This research shows that assessments of changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems due to shock events can be conducted successfully based on proxy data and the three-part framework developed here. We found that shock events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to unexpected results with respect to the direction and magnitude of changes in livestock emissions depending on contextual factors and environmental conditions. Thus, we call for more spatially explicit and continued data collection to assess and monitor the consequences of shock events on GHG emissions from livestock and related SDGs in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Climate change presents an agricultural challenge in the Southeastern USA with implications for maintaining environmental quality. The objective of this study was to assess climate change impacts and adaptation practices (biochar and irrigation) simulated with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model on nitrate-N (NO3-N) losses, microbial respiration (MR) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Southeastern USA. The EPIC model was used to assess the impacts of climate change and adaptations on NO3-N losses in leachate and runoff from the soil profile (0–100 cm), loss of soil C via MR (0–100 cm), and impacts on SOC stocks (0–10 cm) for representative farms growing C3 and C4 crops within ten Southeastern USA states. The adaptations explored were annual biochar applications and irrigation. Historical baseline (1979–2009) and future (2041–2070) climate scenarios were used for simulations with CO2 concentrations of 360 ppm and 500 ppm, respectively. Four regional climate models (RCMs), nested within global climate models (GCMs) for their boundary conditions, simulated changes in air temperatures, precipitation, and solar radiation. Climate change increased simulated NO3-N losses in leaching and runoff by 40–80%, compared to historical baseline scenarios that was attributed to overall increased annual precipitation under three of the four RCM_GCM models. For the C4 crops, NO3-N leaching and runoff losses were 16–47% and 31–45% lower than for the C3 crops, respectively. Biochar applications reduced NO3-N leaching in the West region during 2066–2070 under the RCM3_CGCM3 model. The differences in MR between the C4 and C3 crops ranged from 3 to 75%. SOC increased under C4 crops and when biochar was applied. We concluded that inclusion of C4 crops in crop rotations and the applications of biochar under wetter climate scenarios may be a promising adaptation strategy to reduce NO3-N losses and increase SOC content in the soils of the Southeastern USA. This study represents one of the first attempts to assess the effectiveness of climate change adaptations such as the agricultural use of biochar and irrigation. The findings from this study strongly contribute to our understanding of potential climate change impacts on a region's agriculture and resulting environmental footprint. This information may be used by the scientific community along with decision and policy makers working on conceptual and practical technologies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the environment.",

    "abstract": "In northern West Bengal and southern Bangladesh, Rabi crops, sown in winter and harvested in the spring, are an important source of income and nutrition for the target communities. In the study areas, NGOs and extension services have been engaging with farming communities on selecting suitable crops for the upcoming season. This engagement took place in the absence of quantitative tools to discuss trade offs and what-if scenarios to support an informed discussion. The objective of this study was to design a crop-choice model to support extension agronomists in engaging with the farming communities more effectively using a quantitative analysis tool. In this process, we explored how agricultural system models can be inclusive and allow participation and eventual application by NGO and government extension agents, using a process of gender sensitive contribution. The crop-choice model includes several constraints related to available resources, including land, labour, capital and technologies to calculate optimal crop areas within the Rabi season. The crop choices are determined considering gender specific community perceptions of risks, labour use, market, price-volatility, self-consumption, water use and cash flow. The model was used to explore the consequences of different crop choices on income, gender specific labour, use of inputs and markets, and to reveal the trade-offs of pursuing different crop choice pathways in the context of agricultural intensification. The initial model was demonstrated to the farmers and the extension agents, and based on their reflections, it was fine-tuned further to make the engagement process more effective. For better communication with the participating farmers, the model related questions and findings were translated in the local language (Bengali). We found that the modelling process can be made more inclusive from the outset by including farmers, NGO and extension agents as co-contributors of the model at each of the modelling steps and incorporating their reflections. Such an inclusive and reflective approach provides easy-to-use interfaces and enables translation of model results in ways that more effectively benefit farming communities. The process of engagement with farmers during tool development has been very valuable to farmers and researchers alike and the use of the tool has made the farmers informed about alternative scenarios and led to actual benefits for crop choice decision making. Inclusive farming systems models need to consider the gender dimension and its critical role in farm decision making and how this can be included in models to reflect the diversity of decision process. To maximise relevance of the model for next users and farmers, it was important that these key stakeholders were part of the model development from the beginning, this study has focused on the same throughout. This study demonstrated that appropriate design and development principles enabled bioeconomic farming systems models to be used by NGO and government extension agents to engage with farming communities as discussion support tools in farming decisions. Such an approach would make the engagement process more convincing and effective. Besides, it would also provide useful insights to the NGO and extension agents in revising their intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Yield gap analysis plays an important role in determining potential food availability. The Global Yield Gap Atlas maps yield gaps of crops from point to regional scale across the globe. The calculated yield gaps are based on comparisons between modelled potential yields with actual farmers' yields derived from statistical sources. The calculations are subject to uncertainty due to various sources, including measurement errors, modelling limitations, and scaling issues. An important goal of the Atlas is to convey an uncertainty evaluation of the yield gap analysis. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical methodology that can make the assessment of the uncertainty by experts explicit and accessible for users of the Atlas. We developed an uncertainty protocol and guidelines listing several sources of uncertainty to be considered by country agronomists who were involved in the calculation of the yield gaps. These experts are asked to score the level of uncertainty of each source, as well as the relative impact of each source. Both scores are combined into uncertainty scores for each source. Aggregated uncertainty scores for yield gaps, potential and actual yields are mapped as colours in the Atlas to indicate ranking. Moreover, experts are encouraged to provide a justification for their scores, which are also made available to users of the Atlas. The uncertainty protocol was applied to 189 country-crop combinations by fourteen experts. They ranked lack of data for model calibration, model sensitivity to specific conditions, weather data, and the data quality on cropping system as the most important uncertainty sources for potential yields. The quality of yield data was ranked as the highest source of uncertainty for actual yields. The justifications provided by experts suggest which uncertainty sources may be reducible with relatively little effort, while other uncertainty sources may be more difficult or impractical to address. The decision making on options to improve food production is better informed when uncertainties are accounted for. The proposed uncertainty protocol allows users to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty as well as their level and relative effect on the end result. The ranking of uncertainty sources suggests a prioritization of future effort to reduce the uncertainty around yield gaps. The justifications given by the experts can provide suggestions for options to reduce uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Overwintering beef cows is a major cost in Canadian cow-calf production systems and swath grazing is a potential alternative to reduce winter feeding cost relative to the traditional drylot feeding systems. The objective was to estimate and compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from winter feeding systems: i) swath grazing on triticale, ii) swath grazing on corn, and iii) conventional drylot feeding systems (control). Data were obtained from a study conducted over three production cycles (2008/2009, 2009/2010, 2010/2011) at the Lacombe Research Center in western Canada. Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated by calculating methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from different sources using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 approach. Methane emissions were estimated from enteric fermentation and manure, N2O emissions from fertilization and manure, and CO2 emissions from energy use for farm activities related to feed production and processing, feed and bedding delivery and manure removal. Total emission expressed per kg of feed produced and fed were significantly (P < 0.001) lower for both the swath grazing treatments relative to the control treatment. Emissions per cow varied among treatments (P < 0.001), higher for control (12.3 kg CO2e cow-d− 1) than corn (9.4 kg CO2e cow-d− 1), with triticale (11.0 kg CO2e cow-d− 1) intermediate. In all the treatments, the largest fraction of emissions was enteric CH4 (69–76%), followed by N2O (14–24%). The contribution of energy-derived CO2 emissions for total GHG emissions was lower in swath grazing treatments (5–7%) compared to a traditional feeding system (11%) due to their minimal energy use. Farm activity related energy use was 9.4, 11.5 and 21.4 MJ cow-d− 1 for triticale, corn and conventional drylot feeding, respectively. This study indicated that swath grazing on triticale or corn can be an effective alternative winter feeding systems to reduce GHG emissions and increase energy use efficiency of Canadian beef cattle industry.",

    "abstract": "Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (GMHT) maize tolerant to the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate is a possible addition to the weed control toolbox of European farmers. We modelled ex-ante the economic and environmental changes associated with the adoption of GMHT maize in Europe. A dataset from a survey of maize farmers conducted in seven European countries was used to construct a baseline of current herbicide use and costs in maize cultivation. A stochastic partial budgeting model was used to simulate the impacts of adoption of GMHT maize on farmers' gross margin. We built a first scenario representing the initial years of introduction of the technology (low, fixed technology fee and an herbicide program for GMHT maize based exclusively on glyphosate). Assuming that all farmers who benefit from the technology will adopt GMHT maize, the model predicts very high adoption rates for all seven countries (60–98% of maize farmers depending on the country). We also calculated the Environmental Impact Quotient Index (EIQ) associated with herbicide use when switching to GMHT maize. In ES, PT and CZ, countries with a high baseline of herbicide use in maize, the majority of adopting farmers (60–79%) will also experience reductions in EIQ, realising the economic and environmental potential of the technology. In contrast, for countries such as FR, DE and HU, only a fraction (19–28%) of adopting farmers experiences a decreased EIQ. In this situation, a purely economic-driven adoption may result in increased EIQ for many adopting farmers. We also explored the effects of additional scenarios introducing more complex herbicide programmes for delaying weed resistance and changes in the technology fee of GMHT seeds. In these scenarios adoption levels decrease but the technology is still economically attractive for a large share of farmers (14–86%), showing that a sustainable use of the technology to lower the risk of weed resistance development is not in contradiction with its economic attractiveness. These scenarios do not change significantly the proportion of adopting farmers for which the EIQ decreases. The pattern of two groups of countries in terms of potential environmental effects remains and calls for a better identification of the subset of farmers with economic and environmental potential for the technology. Finally, our results confirm that farmers are the main economic beneficiary of GMHT maize introduction while the technology provider is not able to capture all the benefits generated by the technology due to heterogeneity within the farmer population.",

    "abstract": "Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) has had an increasing role in the agricultural policy arena, as it aims to address climate change mitigation, adaptation and food security goals in an integrated way. In regions where agriculture has been constrained because of soil degradation and climate change, CSA aims to implement soil-based strategies that restore soil function and increase carbon storage. The extent to which such strategies succeed in achieving mitigation, adaptation and productivity goals is referred to as climate-smartness. The co-evolution of yield and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) over the years presents a proxy for the trade-off between productivity, soil fertility and carbon sequestration. Yield and SOC are widely monitored, analysed and used to inform CSA planning. Yet their analysis is often conducted separately and for a small number of years, which neglects long-term soil fertility dynamics and their impact on crops. Given the absence of integrated climate-smartness metrics to capture the trade-offs and synergies between SOC and yield, we present a soil-based Climate-Smartness Index (SCSI). The SCSI is computed using normalized indicators of trend and variability of annual changes on yield and SOC data. The SCSI was calculated for a set of published experiments that compared Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices with conventional management. The CA treatments scored higher SCSI during the first 5 years of evaluation as compared to conventional management. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of climate-smartness indicated that minimum SCSI values typically occurred before 5 years after the start of the experiment, indicating potential trade-offs between SOC and yield. Conversely, SCSI values peaked between 5 and 10 years. After 20 years, the SCSI tended towards zero, as substantial changes in either SOC or yield are no longer evidenced. The SCSI can be calculated for annual crops under any soil management and at different time periods, providing a consistent metric for climate-smartness across both practices and time.",

    "abstract": "Myanmar has made rapid economic progress since the country began its transition to a more integrated market economy in the late 2000s. Although these gains are led by positive developments in the agricultural sector, agricultural productivity and profitability are among the lowest in Asia with high rates of poverty especially in rural areas. Small-scale farms dominate rural livelihoods in Myanmar, especially for the 87% of Myanmar's poor who live in rural areas. Hence, these small-scale farms are critical development leverage points as they are an important source of rural incomes to both farm and non-farm households. This study is part of a larger, five-year agricultural research and development project intended to upgrade pork and rice value chains and strengthen rural livelihoods in southern Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region. We evaluated producer-focused interventions to upgrade the pork value chain using tools that consider the dynamic and complex nature of the chain. This research used systems thinking and participatory methods to develop a system dynamics model of the pork value chain in southern Myanmar. The model integrated modules of animal production, marketing, investment, finance, and collective action. Scenario analysis with the model guided recommendations for pro-poor interventions for implementation within the five-year development project. Simulation results indicated that a mix of technical interventions implemented by functional producer groups showed promise in delivering sustained financial benefits to the target community and outperformed the short-term gains generated by these interventions in the absence of collective action. The model also highlighted specific interventions, such as improved financial services, animal health workers, and training that enabled poorer households to benefit from pig livelihoods while reducing risks from environmental and economic shocks. Within complex agri-food systems such as the pork value chain in Tanintharyi, a multi-pronged intervention strategy is recommended to address problems faced by small-scale agribusiness value chain participants. Development interventions tend to be implemented in complex environments, often with scarce data to inform decision-making. This research shows how system dynamics tools and spatial group model building processes could help overcome these inherent challenges by creating virtual laboratories where plausible project interventions can be tested and modified, bringing increased confidence to implementation choices.",

    "abstract": "Nebraska, US, is projected to face increased winter and spring precipitation, and drier summers as the climate changes over the next 20 to 30 years. Agricultural adaptations and adjustments would be critical to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and achieve global food security. Focusing on the projected climatic change projections for Nebraska, our objective is to analyze data from a long-term (31 years; 1986–2016) rainfed agriculture experiment to determine how past years, that had similar conditions to the projected future climate - wetter winter (WW), wetter spring (WS), and dry summer (DS), responded to these conditions and attempt to describe the near-future (upcoming 20–30 years) corn and soybean yield, and income returns in northeast Nebraska. First, we used a meteorological drought index, to determine years with projected future climate (6 years with WW, 4 years with WS, and 4 years with DS) and 9 all normal (AN) seasons years during the study period. Second, we performed a linear mixed-model analysis of variance to compare treatment (tillage: no-till, disk-till and plow-till; crop rotation: continuous-corn, corn-soybean; Nitrogen rates: 0–160 kg-N/ha) interaction and their effect on crop yield between projected future climate (WW, WS and DS) years and AN years. Finally, we used partial budgeting to calculate change in income and income risk across imposed management practices. Results indicate that corn years with WW, WS, and DS seasons showed yield reductions of 9.1%, 10.9%, and 38.6% compared to an average AN season corn yield, which was 11.3 Mg/ha. Compared to the average AN season yield of 3.6 Mg/ha, soybean yields were + 1.4%, −3.3%, and − 31.8% for WW, WS, and DS, respectively. These yield differences did not significantly affect average corn and soybean income return in WW and WS years compared to the AN years (900 $/ha). However, total income returns in DS seasons regardless of pre-season conditions was about 40% of income return in AN seasons from CS (900 $/ha) and CC (800 $/ha), respectively. Soybean yield and income returns were more stable than corn, which resulted in the corn-soybean rotation system always being higher in yields and being more profitable. Our recommended management practice of disk tillage and corn-soybean rotation with 80 kg-N/ha could result in highest and stable income returns in near-future. Such long-term crop experimental studies can serve as an important complement to crop-model studies to get improved insight into future crop yield and income returns.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-grazing by sheep and cattle is the simultaneous or sequential grazing of a pasture by the two species. It is an agroecological practice known to improve lamb liveweight gains through parasite dilution (PD) and/or forage niche sharing (FNS). We assessed the combined and relative strengths of the two mechanisms by developing a metabolic approach (French uplands context). We used recently published equations to model the infection cost of gastrointestinal nematodes in metabolizable energy (ME), and crude protein (CP). By comparing infection levels in mixed and monospecific grazing, we quantified the gains of PD in ME and CP. We also used feed value tables to assess the gains in ME and CP resulting from FNS sheep diet improvement. We interpreted these gains in light of ME and CP requirements of lambs. We applied this approach to the dataset of a mixed-grazing experiment, involving sheep monospecific grazing and mixed sheep/cattle grazing, without veterinary treatment. We also applied it to a generic situation where we studied the relative gains in ME and CP, along gradients of increasing strength of PD and FNS. The approach applied to our experimental data revealed that i) infection by gastrointestinal nematodes can represent 100% of ME and 57% of CP requirements in monospecific grazing, ii) mixed-grazing can reduce these costs to 23% and 12%, respectively and iii) PD was more important than FNS in terms of ME gains, whereas the opposite was true for CP. However, meeting CP requirements was less constraining than meeting ME requirements on the studied grassland type, which puts into perspective the importance of CP gains. With the generic approach, most of the modelled situations also identified PD as the main mechanisms of ME gain (79%), whereas it was FNS for CP (70%), with the same observation that CP requirements were less difficult to meet. Both approaches suggest that in our modelled context, PD matters more often than FNS in mixed-grazing, due to the greater difficulty in meeting ME requirements. We proposed a novel approach to assess the roles of two biological mechanisms of contrasting nature, with the help of common metrics. This approach made it possible to evaluate their combined and relative strength. It has the potential to improve our understanding of the impact of interacting biological mechanisms involved in agroecological grazing systems, and identify prominent ones.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural landscapes play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. The presence of trees outside forests has been recognized as a significant carbon pool, but it is crucial to acknowledge that these trees serve purposes beyond being a carbon sink. This study focuses on integrating border trees and home gardens as distinct land use classes in Indonesian Javanese agricultural land to assess their impact on carbon stock potential and biodiversity connections. The objective is to classify and quantify the tree composition of these classes, estimate their carbon stock potential, analyze plant species diversity, and identify the ecological connections between home gardens and field borders. To achieve this, high-resolution multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar images were used from four sampling areas covering 100 km2 each in Lamongan and Malang districts, East Java, Indonesia, for land cover/land use mapping. The land use function method was used to identify border trees and home gardens as separate land use classes. Carbon stock potential was estimated based on tree cover composition, while plant species diversity was analyzed through field surveys and farmer focus group discussions. Crops with border trees cover approximately 28% to 48% of the cropland area in the study sites, while home gardens represent about 74% to 85% of the settlement area. This suggests a potential to double tree presence in these sites by adopting border trees and home gardens practices across the entire area. The median tree cover ratio was around 27% for border trees and 33% for home gardens. This stratification approach identified 31% to 50% more carbon stock compared to calculations using standard classes. Furthermore, home gardens and border trees show a positive correlation with species richness, indicating their role as keepers of biodiversity. Therefore, home gardens and border trees could serve as a sustainability indicator for agricultural land in the Javanese farm system. This research contributes to sustainable agricultural practices and climate change mitigation. The stratification approach of identifying border trees and home gardens offers a cost-effective approach for the better computation of carbon stock and can lead to effective land use policies and conservation measures that promote ecological resilience. The study provides valuable insights for similar agricultural contexts worldwide, guiding efforts toward a more sustainable agricultural future.",

    "abstract": "Beef production on grasslands has multiple positive impacts. In addition to the production of high-quality protein, marginal lands in particular enable high biodiversity and landscape quality. However, this type of production is perceived as less economical than more intensive meat production systems. The aim of the study is to develop recommendations on how different grass-based production systems can be economically improved without endangering biodiversity. Thirty-five suckler cow farms supplying into two different brand programmes (Natura-Veal: slaughter age at five months; Natura-Beef: slaughter age at 10 months) were grouped into four production systems across two production sites in Switzerland: Natura-Veal, mountain region, extensive (VMount); Natura-Beef, mountain region (BMount); Natura-Veal, hilly region, intensive (VHill) and Natura-Beef, lowlands (BLowla). On the farms, beef production was analysed in detail on the basis of technical production data as well as full cost accounting. The farms were grouped into one model farm (farm type) per production system. On each model farm, optimisation options were simulated and checked for practicability with farmer participation. The optimisation focused primarily on improving cow efficiency via the sale of more slaughter animals per cow, through lower animal losses, higher fertility or the additional purchase of calves suckled by a nurse cow. Descriptive statistics showed significant positive correlations between stocking rate and land productivity and significant negative correlations between stocking rate/land productivity and the share of biodiversity areas (SBA), confirming previous findings. These relationships were also reflected in the production site of the farms, as mountain farms with lower productivity had a significantly higher SBA, while farms in areas with better grass growth had fewer biodiversity areas but higher productivity. Accordingly, the optimisation options were adapted to the production site under the constraint of a constant stocking rate. In favourable forage-growing areas, further intensification via improving cow efficiency by buying foreign calves led to significant improvements in profitability (VHill and BLowla). In mountain areas, the optimisation potential is lower. Site-adapted, i.e., small-framed and robust, cow types lead to better cow efficiency, which also contributes to good profitability in extensive production with a high biodiversity share, although this is strongly determined by national direct payments (VMount and BMount). Both income and biodiversity can be optimised if cow efficiency is increased and production systems are adapted to the site as closely as possible. The study shows practicable recommendations for sustainable intensification in grass-based meat production systems in the current discussion on maintaining or increasing biodiversity in agriculture.",

Existing tools do not use available ancillary information, or do not have the functionality needed for farm-scale soil carbon auditing. Using a grid of predicted carbon content with associated uncertainty, the software optimises a stratified random sampling design, such that the profit is maximised on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. As the algorithm is computationally intensive, the package is written in Julia for speed. From a case study we conclude that our software is an effective tool for farm-scale soil carbon auditing, and that it outperforms the existing tools in terms of efficiency and functionality.",

In this paper, we determine the land required for food production and compare it with the land required for cooking fuel (i.e. fuelwood) for six different regions of India. We use regional data to assess the land requirements for both food and fuelwood. Dietary patterns and agricultural yields are the major drivers of land demand for food production. The average land requirement for food is about 1000 m2/cap/yr, but the values range between 800-1300 m2/cap/yr. The greatest proportion of this land requirement is for cereals, especially rice and wheat. Determining the land needed for cooking fuel requires biomass productivity and fuelwood use. We found that the average land requirement for fuelwood is about 3 to 7 times larger than the area required to produce food. Thus, there is a wide disparity in land demand between all the regions of India. Dietary change is not an option as rural inhabitants are already consuming less than their urban counterparts. Changes to cooking fuels could be another option. This comparative study shows the high demand for land for cooking fuel in comparison to food. It implies that, from a land requirement perspective, reducing the fuelwood consumption and shifting to a more efficient cooking fuel would be a better option.",

We use a spatial regression discontinuity design and high-resolution soil erosion data. Our results suggest strong discontinuities in current soil erosion rates along the former border of the Soviet Union. We find that soil erosion in countries that were part of the former Soviet Union is 26% lower than in neighboring countries (0.77 tons per hectare and year). In contrast, we do not find such discontinuity in potential soil erosion under natural vegetation, underlining that this effect is man-made. We show that the main mechanism is a sharp discontinuity in forest dynamics, whereas general economic and demographic differences are less important.",

    "abstract": "In response to societal concerns, the European Union set up goals to address the negative impact of intensive broiler production on animal welfare, the environment and human health. This paper aimed to 1) explore combinations of system changes that perform best in terms of farm income, animal welfare, emissions of ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM10) and 2) are robust to changes in society's expectations relating to animal welfare and environmental sustainability. The prevailing system in the Dutch broiler market was used as a baseline for evaluating system changes. Animal welfare, NH3 emissions and PM10 emissions were the three external factors chosen for this evaluation. Farm income was quantified by the net return to labor and management (NRLM). Expert knowledge elicitation was used to identify system changes that were likely to be implemented in the baseline system. Combinations were made by selecting system changes from each of the chosen external factors. A deterministic model was used to calculate the effect of each combination of system changes on net return to labor and management. The performance of each combination was evaluated by estimating a benefit-of-the-doubt composite indicator. Results show that 8 out of 70 combinations indicated a better outcome and were more robust to potential changes in society's expectations relating to animal welfare and environmental sustainability. These combinations included two or more of the following system changes: 'lower density' (30 kg/m2), '2 types of enrichment', and 'daylight'. Furthermore, these combinations included 'tube heaters' for the abatement of NH3 emissions, and 'negative air ionization system' or 'ionization filter' for the abatement of PM10 emissions. To compensate for the decrease in NRLM associated with these practices and abatement techniques, a price premium was required that ranged between 4.8 and 18.5 eurocents/broiler. We conclude that combinations including animal welfare related system changes (lower density, enrichment and/or daylight), tube heaters and an ionization technique performed best and were robust to changes of societal expectations of these external factors. The insights obtained from this paper can support decision making in improving the sustainability of current broiler production systems.",

    "abstract": "The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa; however, options to increase forage production may entail trade-offs within the farm system that can be challenging to quantify explicitly. This study examined how maize (Zea mays L.) leaf stripping affected maize and sheep productivity and associated labour requirements, and farm system trade-offs and synergies in four communities in the Northern Region of Ghana. Maize leaf stripping involved removing almost senesced leaves from maize plants below the cob level at silking. We combined data from three sources: on-farm maize trials with 28 farmers from two seasons (2017 and 2018), on-farm sheep feeding trials where the pasture-based diets of weaner sheep were supplemented with stripped maize leaves fed in pens (conducted in 2019), and farm survey data from 117 households (conducted in 2014), seven of which were in the on-farm maize trials and owned sheep. We examined the trial data using linear mixed-effects models. Maize leaf stripping had no significant effect on maize grain yield but had a significant positive effect on maize forage protein yield from leaf and stover. Offering maize leaves to weaner sheep had a significant positive effect on average daily liveweight gain, estimated marginal mean was 29.3 g with maize leaves and −10.9 g without maize leaves. For the maize-sheep systems of the seven households, non-inferential statistics suggested that on average maize leaf stripping reduced total maize grain production by 12% (range −46 to 38) and increased maize forage protein production from leaf and stover by 90% (range −16 to 298). Stripping the maize leaves from one hectare of land took an extra 34 h (range 27 to 42) of labour, which was counterbalanced by reduced labour time for grazing as sheep were fed the maize leaves in pens. For the 117 farmers, heterogeneity in maize areas planted and livestock numbers resulted in heterogeneous production and labour effects of maize leaf stripping. Farmers qualitatively described how maize leaf stripping released labour so children could spend more time at school rather than shepherding. We quantified in northern Ghana how maize leaf stripping altered crop and livestock productivity and associated trade-offs and synergies in the farm system, including labour. Changes in crop management often have implications beyond the crop's field and examining these implications can provide insights into the suitability of alternative farm management options.",

The formulations are all physiologically based but vary in the detail with which A is represented. When implemented in two crop models, all formulations predict increased yield under elevated CO2, with the formulation incorporating the most detailed representation of A predicting the smallest yield increase. In the crop model with more complex representations of growth and yield, and where increased photoassimilates under elevated CO2 are allowed to affect processes such as leaf area development, yield predictions under elevated CO2 can be substantially greater than the predicted increase in A for each formulation. These results indicate that the representation of A and assumptions regarding adaptation to elevated CO2 of A, crop growth and carbon partitioning will have large impacts on simulation model predictions of crop yields at elevated CO2.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a systematic and comprehensive literature review of agricultural research for development (AR4D) programs. The review aims to distil commonly mentioned outcomes of AR4D programs and intervention, their causal conditions, and their causal relationships. The review also seeks to unpack what complex causation means in the context of AR4D. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review covers the period from 1980 to June 2023 and includes a meticulous selection of peer-reviewed journal articles, books, chapters, and grey literature (n = 57 from an initial sample of n = 427). The findings reveal a clear and limited set of outcomes and conditions, highlighting coherence and manageability within the field. However, concerns arise regarding the representation of real-world AR4D programs, with a bias towards reporting positive outcomes and successful initiatives while overlooking less successful or failing programs, particularly from Latin America and Central Asia. Complex causation emerges as a recurrent theme, emphasizing the need for innovative research methods to understand the intricate relationships between outcomes and multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, scaling successful programs is a pressing topic, challenging assumptions of replicability and calling for a comprehensive understanding of scaling processes. This study underscores calls in the field for adopting alternative research methods and critically evaluating the existing knowledge base to enhance the effectiveness and impact of AR4D programmes and interventions.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture plays a central role as a feedstock provider for the bioeconomy. However, utilization competing with food production and associated land use change have previously been a matter of debate. Nonetheless, strengthening the productivity of agroecosystems through sustainable intensification can prevent the depletion of natural resources, enhance food security, and facilitate adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. This study explores the effects of combining crop residue removal for use as biomass feedstock with the establishment of intermediate crops to compensate for organic carbon depletion in arable land in Sweden. The analysis relied on Swedish national agricultural statistics at the highest available spatial resolution (yield survey district). Crop residue calculations factored in crop:residue ratios, and harvestable and recoverable potentials. A model was devised to estimate land availability for cultivating intermediate crops based on generalized crop rotation sequences, and a spatial interpolation was employed to determine oilseed radish yields as a model intermediate crop. Estimates of long-term soil carbon inputs hinged on biomass carbon content and humification coefficients dependent on soil clay content. The total annual residual biomass availability in the country stands at approximately 2139 kt per year. The potential harvestable biomass production from intermediate crops was estimated at 383 kt per year. However, spatial differences were evident in total biomass production and effects on soil organic carbon inputs. For the majority of districts, the inclusion of intermediate crops could offset the negative effect of a complete removal of crop residues on soil organic carbon inputs. In other cases, establishing intermediate crops could not compensate for these negative effects, but some differences were observed when comparing the harvesting and the incorporation of the intermediate crops' biomass. Spatial disparities originated from variations in soil texture, intermediate crop yield, and rotation sequences. This research is an attempt to address the challenge of maintaining and increasing the soil carbon stocks under the context of a growing biomass demand in a developing biobased economy. It highlights the divergent effects of combining crop residue removal with the inclusion of intermediate crops under distinct agroecological conditions in the Northern European context. By giving estimates on biomass availability and effects on soil organic carbon inputs, we provide information that can support decision making for bioeconomy planning and sustainable resource utilization. This also has long-term implications for preservation of soil fertility, agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivation in Colombia has increased exponentially since 2006 (over 41-fold in relation to 2020), driven by a favorable export market. It is a particularly promising crop for creating livelihood opportunities in the region, especially for vulnerable populations such as victims of forced displacement and single mothers. Basil cultivation can foster economic empowerment, strengthen the community social fabric, and support sustainable development. Based on previous studies, Valle del Cauca has suitable soil and climatic conditions for this crop, making it one of the country's most promising regions for its cultivation. Our study aimed to create a model to identify biophysically suitable zones in Valle del Cauca for basil cultivation. We used a variety of techniques for our model. First, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify the criteria for the biophysical suitability model. We then used a multi-criteria analysis methodology to evaluate the weight of each criterion, indicating its relative importance for the crop. We subsequently applied the Suitable Crop Location Index (SCLI) using spatial analysis techniques to generate a suitability map, illustrating the most suitable areas for basil cultivation. Lastly, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the critical factors and the model's stability. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools that integrated fuzzy suitability functions and aptitude criteria weighting, drawing on the Analytical Hierarchical Process. Our model explored a primary and a secondary scenario to assess the suitable areas in the event of average and 75% rainfall exceedance. Our study model identified the southern part of the department as the most suitable for basil production, particularly the municipalities of Cali and Jamundí. These areas, currently used primarily for sugarcane cultivation, offer 161,052 ha of suitable land (categorized as good and very good), accounting for 5% of the territory studied. While the model could be further refined by considering the socioeconomic and ecosystem information, this study provides valuable information for decision-makers, producer associations, and organizations interested in promoting, investing in, and establishing basil production as a commercially viable crop, by facilitating the identification of the most suitable cultivation areas for its production.",

    "abstract": "Organizations often use agri-environmental policies and program to promote Best Management Practice (BMPs) adoption, which are meant to mitigate on-farm environmental risks. However, producer preferences for programs and collaborative organizations are often overlooked during the process of policy implementation. Producers are likely to feel more inclined to accept information from, and otherwise engage with, some organizations over others. Overlooking such preferences may have led to inefficient policies that did not engage the intended audience, resulting in minimal BMP uptake. The goal of this paper is to investigate the preferences of Canadian producers for climate-mitigative policy options and partner organizations that impact or encourage BMP adoption, two variables deemed critical to on-farm BMP adoption decisions. We use a survey-based method for assessing individuals' priorities in the form of most and least preferred choices from a set of available options. Our analysis reveals that producers prefer financial support, while certification, extension, carbon offsets and carbon taxation are all significantly less likely to be chosen as the most preferred climate policy. As for organizations producers prefer to work with, the provincial government and county or municipal governments are their first-choice collaborative organizations when it comes to climate-mitigation in agriculture. In contrast, producers in Alberta are more likely to choose environmental NGOs as their least preferred organization. The results also show these preferences are altered when interacted with producer characteristics. Beliefs about climate change significantly alter their policy preferences: those who believe in human-caused (anthropogenic) climate change are more likely to support several climate-mitigative policies, with the notable exception of a tax on carbon and carbon offsets. We also find farm typology and being an avid adopter of BMPs alters producers' policy preferences, but not organization preferences. Given the challenges to changing producers' on-farm decision making, the results of this paper can help guide those who develop and implement climate-mitigative policies and programs by providing an overview of preferred policies that are more likely to be accepted by agricultural producers. This includes helping tailor policy approaches in collaboration with trusted partners and understanding what factors, such as farm typology and climate change beliefs, may influence the acceptance of these climate-mitigative policies.",

    "abstract": "Food systems urgently need transformations to meaningfully reduce food insecurity and hunger without compromising sustainability. These structural changes involve challenging the status quo by engaging diverse stakeholders and perspectives. This research aims to enhance the contributions of participatory modeling approaches in supporting the transformation of food systems. Thereby, it proposes and applies a Participatory Food Systems Modeling (PFSM) framework to identify desirable and culturally feasible transformation pathways in food systems. Aligned with Participatory Modeling and Soft Systems Methodology principles, the PFSM framework proposes three phases for stakeholders with diverse perspectives to collectively make sense and learn about food systems complexity, negotiate and agree on a desired future, and explore desirable and culturally feasible pathways that move forward. To test its value to support transformations, the PFSM is applied in poultry systems in Southern Senegal, where traditional poultry farming prevails. The PFSM application in the case study demonstrated its value in identifying desirable and culturally feasible pathways, thus setting the groundwork for informing meaningful, realistic, and stakeholders-driven decisions in support of the needed transformation. Linking the PFSM to real-world situations offered valuable insights into how participatory modeling approaches can contribute to addressing barriers to food systems transformations, such as power imbalances and conflicts and undesirable trade-offs arising from divergent perspectives. In Southern Senegal's poultry system, the PFSM framework informed the identification of four transformation pathways focused on (i) enhancing farmers' financial capacity, (ii) reinforcing policies supporting the poultry sector, (iii) improving farmers' membership in associations, and (iv) enhancing farmers' access to technologies, information, and knowledge. Tailored to poultry farmers adopting different livelihood strategies, these pathways aim to provide sustainable livelihoods and improved food security in rural households. The significance of the PFSM framework extends to political, scientific, and practical reams. Politically, it informs the debates and decisions on the future of food systems based on stakeholders' interests, concerns, and aspirations, thereby improving the significance and meaningfulness of decisions. Scientifically, it elevates the contributions of participatory modeling contributions to transformative processes. Practically, it supports addressing real-world challenges through transformations.",

    "abstract": "Timor-Leste's National Aquaculture Development Strategy (NADS) 2012–30 aims to achieve an annual aquaculture production of 12,000 tons by 2030 to raise per capita fish consumption from 6.1 kg in 2010 to 15 kg. Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) is identified as the most suitable species under Timor-Leste's existing farming systems and agro-ecological context. It is expected to account for two-thirds of total aquaculture production, requiring over 30 million fingerlings annually, necessitating a strong role of public and private sectors to develop a sustainable hatchery model for producing and supplying high quality GIFT fingerlings to fish farmers on a mass-scale. The major objective was to conceptualize and apply a public-private partnership (PPP) model to produce and disseminate high-quality monosex GIFT seed by public and private hatcheries across Timor-Leste. Model GIFT hatcheries were established and monitored using a standard protocol developed by the R&D team. Data on total eggs, clutch size, incubation survival rate, swim-up fry, and monosex fry produced were recorded on a weekly basis. The performance of hatcheries was compared using descriptive statistics at a 5% level of significance. Economic analysis was conducted to compare production costs, gross profits, and net profits among hatcheries and nurseries. Enabling conditions and factors for effective PPP were identified. The WorldFish, in collaboration with Timor-Leste's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, upgraded an existing public hatchery in Gleno, Ermera, introduced GIFT in 2015, and developed it as a GIFT broodstock centre to supply quality brood fry to other hatcheries. To produce monosex seed on a mass-scale, four PPP model GIFT hatcheries were established between 2019 and 2023. Results from a public hatchery and two initially established PPP model hatcheries showed that the hatchery in Parlamento had significantly higher (P < 0.05) monthly production of eggs, swim-up fry, monosex fry, and clutch sizes. On average, over 177,000 monosex fry per month were produced by those three hatcheries. Local service providers (LSPs), self-employed youths who have been recruited and trained to facilitate input supply and output marketing, purchase GIFT fry from the hatcheries, nurse them to fingerling size, and supply them to farmers. To achieve high seed production and supply targets, scaling of PPP model hatcheries, nurseries, and LSPs along with effective training and technical back-up, favourable policies, institutional environments, and governance mechanisms, is necessary. The PPP model GIFT hatcheries are scalable across inland farming systems in Timor-Leste and other countries with similar agro-ecological, socio-economic, and climatic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Although playing a role in global food security, beef production systems cause concerns due to pressure on land for feed production and greenhouse gas emissions. We aimed at quantifying the trade-offs associated with different beef cattle diet compositions, considering beef meat production, greenhouse gas emissions, and land use impacts. In addition, we evaluated the influence of dry periods and grazing improvement for trade-off mitigation. We developed a model linking beef cattle diet composition to land use impact indicators (feed import requirements and feed-food competition indicators), beef production (proxied by total weight gain [WG]), and animal emissions in a year. We applied the model to the grassland-based beef cattle region of Bourbonnais, France, with a three-step analysis: (i) we explored the model outputs over a joint range of cereal and grass intake; (ii) we investigated the sensitivity of each feed type intake on the outputs; (iii) we simulated scenarios representing situations affecting cattle diet: dry seasons (−20% average crop and grass yield, grazing time, cattle growth rate and less cattle grass intake compensated by an equivalent increase of other feed types), grazing improvement (increasing grass yield by 20% and its digestibility and gross energy content by 5%) and mixed (combining the previous scenarios). Analysis (i) showed that more digestible diets conciliate production with emission reduction; however, they also cause undesired feed imports and feed-food competition. Analysis (ii) showed that, although present in the diet in relatively small quantities, oil protein crops as feed have high impact on model variables and outputs. In analysis (iii), compared to baseline, dry seasons decreases slightly in WG and emissions but increases feed-food competition (human-edible feed +149 g/kg WG) with extra feed importations; Grazing improvement increases WG (+6.02%) and decreases emissions (−3.03%), human-edible feed per WG (−37 g/kg WG) and food-competing land per WG (−5.7×10−5 ha/kg WG) with no additional impact on feed imports; mixed scenario, increases total WG (+1.22%); decreases emissions (−3.25%) with less feed-food competition and less importation than baseline scenario. Beef cattle diet composition, linked to land-use based management practices, is an effective tool to handle the trade-offs at the regional scale. Improving pasture quality alleviates the trade-offs by increasing production, reducing emission, feed-food competition and feed imports. Improving resilience of grasslands to droughts alleviates the negative impacts of dietary changes during dry periods.",

    "abstract": "Most Western-European countries exceed the critical loads for nitrogen (N) losses. High nitrogen (N) inputs make agriculture one of the largest contributors to N pollution. There might be a potential to reduce this losses with an output tax on animal products, as they have low N use efficiency and a tax has the potential to reduce the consumption of this products. We want to assess the potential of a food tax on animal products to reduce the N surplus of Swiss agriculture. We implemented a tax on meat and a tax on milk and meat in the agent-based model SWISSland. The model combines an agent-based model with a microeconomic model at the farm scale. To better understand the low response of the food tax, we applied in a second step a robust two-step global sensitivity analysis of abatement costs of individual model agents. Imposing a tax led to an N surplus reduction of 2.1% where only meat was taxed and 2.3% where both milk and meat were taxed. The sensitivity analysis showed that distinct agents reacted non-uniformly to changing prices, so that the effect of the tax was sometimes even cancelled out. This calls for more differentiated policies to reduce the negative impact of N losses. The overall impact of the food tax was minor as the distinct agents react not uniformly to lower producer prices.",

    "abstract": "We apply a Public–Private Benefit Framework (PPBF) for new perspectives on the distributional consequences of land-use change in upstream watersheds (wide expansion of tree plantations) negatively affecting downstream water users. Our study area is the Macquarie River catchment in central-west New South Wales, as part of Australia's Murray–Darling Basin, where active water entitlement markets exist downstream. We consider benefits and costs to private upstream landholders allowed to establish new plantations without regard to reduced water flows and qualities to downstream users (urban, agricultural and environmental). Second, we explore a policy requiring new plantations to purchase permanent entitlements in advance for amounts of water they will divert from downstream uses; the calculated increase in evapotranspiration above that of current land-use. With no requirement to purchase entitlements, new plantation areas and their increased water consumption would be greatest, as would negative impacts on downstream water users. Some downstream water users are assumed willing to surrender entitlements at lower prices than others, resulting in an upward-sloping supply curve. Demand for entitlements by new upstream plantations will be functions of anticipated tree product yields, prices, establishment and opportunity costs. Their aggregate demand is downward sloping and intersects the supply curve to define the equilibrium quantity and price of water entitlements traded. With a tree product price of $70/m3 the economic consequences of unrestricted expansion of planting in the upper watersheds could be in the order of $639M (tree-NPV, 7%) in upstream private net benefit gains, but $388M in uncompensated losses to downstream public net benefits, counting losses of 154 GL in environmental flows valued at $1M/GL, for total catchment net benefits of $251M. The policy as confirmed by our PPBF, indicates \"flexible negative incentives\" to reduce the expansion of new private plantations by compensating downstream public losses through sale of water entitlements from the latter to the former. Assuming that environmental flows are protected and purchase of downstream water entitlements is required from irrigators and stock and domestic users for new tree plantations, net private benefits of $192M to new plantations are added to $138M in downstream public benefits, improving the net change in catchment benefits to $330M. The policy would improve total net catchment benefit from $251M to $330M, achieving an economically efficient, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable solution, which adjusts automatically over time through the market.",

    "abstract": "Pests and pathogens can have great impacts on agricultural production. The use of plant protection products (PPPs) is a main preventive and curative management method in conventional farming today world-wide. However, increasing evidence shows the negative effects of PPPs on the environment and human health. New, especially preventive, approaches are needed and a promising option for developing these is the redesign of current agricultural systems, in which knowledge about the system and biological processes is integrated. Yet frameworks that can guide this process are not widely used. This study aims to demonstrate the use of an innovative and systematic approach to the development of design concepts for pest and disease management without the use of PPPs, using Phytophthora infestans in potatoes as a case study. The Reflexive Interactive Design method was applied to define design goals, requirements and key functions of the innovative design. These definitions were based on the needs of relevant stakeholders and the biology of the crop and disease. A range of strategies were researched that could effectively limit pathogen transmission and disease severity by interrupting the pathogen's life cycle. The proposed design concept focuses on a combination of more traditional aspects like providing farmers with uninfected starting material and resistant varieties with novel approaches like increasing canopy porosity through intercropping with onions and preventing the spread of inoculum both into and within the field with a combination of host dilution and barriers. This research demonstrates how the Reflexive Interactive Design method can be used to develop innovative solutions for crop protection that go beyond current solution sets. The systematic approach backed by literature provided the compass for the search for new and innovative solutions with strong focus on prevention. The design concept acts as a promising starting point to be further elaborated with stakeholders while effectiveness of the final design concept needs to be tested under real-life conditions.",

    "abstract": "The urgency of redesigning the way food is produced and consumed has implications for the systems perspective of agronomy. An increasingly important strain of research addresses the 'how-to' question associated with the transformation of 'maldesigned' agricultural systems and produces 'transformative knowledge' as part of transitions in-the-making. Such knowledge production goes beyond 'transformation knowledge' resulting from the more classical analytical agronomic approaches and stances. Contributing to transitions in-the-making thus calls for systems agronomists to question their profession's why, what, and how. This special issue brings together contributions by systems agronomists collaborating with other scientists and societal actors revealing the less visible stream of fine-grained work to support transitions in-the-making in agroecosystems. In this introductory paper, changes in research scope and methods emerging from the contributions are highlighted to reinforce the engaged systems agronomist's roles in contributing to food system transitions. Three results stand out: 1) Contributing to transitions in-the-making necessitates going beyond analysis-oriented research stances to address the 'how' of transformative knowledge, and move beyond the more time-efficient dominant 'what' and 'why' questions; 2) Meta-methods are emerging about how to adapt and embed existing agronomic knowledge products within change processes. Reflection on the overarching transformation dynamics and on how to articulate knowledge products and change process will constitute an important extension of the systems agronomist's methods; 3) The efficacy of scientific transformative knowledge development may be enhanced if the notion of design is used more strictly in relation to engagement in societal change. The need to respond to the how-to questions associated with the transformation of the way food is produced and consumed requires systems agronomists to reflect on their stance in the research process, the way they design their research inclusively, and the way they shape their methods. This Special Issue provides promising examples of the (re-)emerging strain of engaged systems agronomists.",

    "abstract": "Intensification of production on land that has already been cleared or in savannahs can contribute to sustainable production systems. A key feature of intensification is genetically superior palms well adapted to the specific local conditions. We propose a participatory breeding and selection scheme that will rapidly provide growers with superior planting material derived from seeds of both Elaeis guineensis and E. oleifera x E. guineensis (OxG hybrid) well adapted to their local conditions. The proposed methodology is: (i) identification of superior families from commercial production performance; (ii) identification of superior individuals within the families in growers fields; (iii) genetic fingerprinting to identify parents of superior individuals and families; (iv) genomic analysis of the superior individuals within the families; (v) genomic selection to identify superior individuals from within superior families already producing in commercial fields; (vi) establishment of nurseries with superior family populations; (vii) genotyping of individual plants in the nursery and selection of superior types based on genomic models for distribution to growers. The planting of selected superior types derived from seed is expected to produce one t crude palm oil ha−1 yr−1 more than currently available materials in well managed plantations. These superior materials will become available to farmers rapidly. The proposed scheme offers the opportunity to rapidly intensify palm oil production by providing farmers with improved genetic material. As growers participate in the selection process the material will be well adapted to their conditions. The materials are not cloned and hence can be distributed through standard multiplication channels. The increased production per unit land area will decrease pressure to bring new land into cultivation to satisfy the demand for vegetable oils.",

    "abstract": "Fertilisers and plant protection products are essential for the economic viability of arable agriculture, but their overuse leads to environmental problems. Microbial applications have been proposed as a solution to reduce these environmental problems in arable farming. Experimental results suggest that microbial applications can increase yields and reduce abiotic stresses with fewer fertilisers and plant protection products. However, the overall effects of microbial applications on farm economics, the environment and social dimensions have not been quantified yet. In this study, we assess the capacity of microbial applications to enhance the sustainability, including environmental, economic and social dimensions, of Dutch potato production. We model a baseline scenario and a microbial application scenario with Monte Carlo simulation, and compare the scenarios using a composite sustainability index. The microbial application scenario is based on data from a Delphi expert elicitation. The model indicates that, at present, microbial interventions do not contribute to the sustainability of Dutch potato production. In fact, the conventional baseline approach is more sustainable compared to the scenario involving microbial applications. In the microbial application scenario, cost per hectare of potato production is almost three times higher than in the baseline scenario, which are not covered by the 3.7% yield and 9.8% revenue increase. However, microbial applications can reduce CO2 emissions by 60% and active substances by 6.6%. Technological advancements are necessary to reduce costs per unit of production and increase environmental sustainability. This study explores the impact of microbial applications on agricultural sustainability amid uncertainty, emphasising the need to quantify their effects. This study highlights the importance of economically viable sustainable practices to incentivise farmers' adoption. While efficient microbial applications can reduce reliance on conventional pesticides and fertilisers, they currently cannot contribute to the Farm-to-Fork reduction goals. Future research should focus on cost-effective microbial applications for disease prevention. We provide four routes for further research on microbial applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding climate change impacts on beef production enterprises in northern Australia is challenging due to the complexity of the system, which involves biophysical processes such as pasture and animal production, herd management, economics, emissions, and the interaction among these things. Modelling is a powerful tool to help the beef industry understand the impacts of climate change and to develop adaptation plans to help ensure enterprises remain economically viable over the long term. We assess climate change impacts on a single specialised beef enterprise south-east of Moura (24.59°S, 150.09°E) in northern Australia's Central Queensland region. This is achieved by comparing enterprise performances during a 2030s climate and a 1975–2013 baseline period. We used a calibrated pasture model called GRASP to simulate the farm's pasture growth under multiple scenarios for land conditions, grass basal areas and stocking rates for the baseline and 2030s climates and to construct pasture growth databases – known as datacubes. The datacubes provide a simplified representation of mean coupling between the herd dynamics and livestock production model (Crop Livestock Enterprise Model). The coupled whole-of-farm model was parameterised using enterprise data collected through interviews with the property owner and allowed for feedback between the pasture and livestock systems. The feedback capability allowed us to consider changes in land condition through stocking rates and their effect on pasture growth, animal weight gain, profit and CO2 emissions. We found that warmer and drier climatic conditions during 2030s will reduce pasture growth in austral spring and summer but increase pasture growth in winter and autumn. Increased pasture growth in winter and autumn cannot compensate for the reduction in pasture growth in the warm seasons but can improve animal liveweight gain in winter and early spring. This leads to an overall increase in annual weight gain of steers (the cattle class that provides the main income source for this farm) while the CO2 emission intensity remains similar to the baseline period. Maintaining land condition under the 2030s climatic conditions considered will require a reduction in sustainable herd size, leading to lower beef production and lower profit under current pasture and herd management strategies. Impacts will likely differ from those described if a drier future is not realised. This study provides a climate change impact assessment on a specialised beef enterprise (i) being distilled from individual ruminants, and (ii) considering environmental feedbacks in the interaction between pasture and livestock systems.",

    "abstract": "Sheep production industries face the challenge of increasing farm production and profit while reducing environmental impacts. Genetic selection using multi-trait breeding indices can be used to improve flock productivity, profitability, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensities (kg CO2-eq /kg of product), however validation of the improved performance of animals ranked higher on breeding indices at a flock level is required. Phenotypic data from 387,580 production records of animals born between 2018 and 2020 of known genetic merit in commercial flocks were inputted to an established bio-economic model. Two contrasting flocks were compared, a flock of ewes ranked High (top 20%) on the Irish replacement Index bred with rams ranked High on the replacement and terminal indices, and a flock of ewes ranked Low (bottom 20%) on the Irish replacement Index bred with rams ranked Low on the replacement and terminal indices. The two flocks were then simulated using life cycle assessment to estimate the GHG emissions profile for both systems. Flock weaning rates were 1.70 and 1.53 lambs weaned per ewe presented for breeding for the High and Low genetic merit flocks, respectively. The flock of High genetic merit ewes sold 0.17 more lambs per ewe, equating to 3.29 kg more lamb carcass per ewe, than the flock of Low genetic merit ewes; lambs from the High genetic merit flock were also sold at an earlier age. The greater production of the High genetic merit flocks resulted in an additional €18/ewe net profit than the Low genetic merit flock. Although total flock GHG emissions were higher for the High genetic merit flock, GHG emissions intensities were lower at 21.7 and 23.3 kg CO2-eq /kg lamb carcass sold for the High and Low genetic merit flocks, respectively. The lower emissions intensity of the High genetic merit flock was due to the dilution effect of higher lamb production and lambs being drafted for slaughter ealier. The results suggest Irish sheep producers can make substantial profit gains through selection according to the national breeding indices while also reducing their environmental impact, and farmers should consider genetic merit when purchasing their rams, particularly sires of replacement ewe lambs.",

    "abstract": "From its early beginnings the Internet has been used by scientists to collaborate and share information about their research. Increasing connectivity and networking capabilities have resulted in improved collaboration functionalities ultimately combined in complete virtual research environments (VRE) as a type of virtual laboratories. These aim at providing collaborative online workplaces with access to all needed tools, data, and computing resources, and supporting data sharing. Since each research domain has its own characteristics, requirements, and preferred tooling, VRE providers must make trade-offs between the specificity of components and the functionality provided. The D4Science VRE adopts a modular approach based on open standards for constructing VREs for interested communities. The agro-climatic science domain develops diverse analytical tools that it connects to heterogenous data sources (i.e. climate data, experimental fields, satellite data, soil samples) originating from other domains, which is often poorly standardised and sparsely interlinked at best. The aim of this paper is to test and evaluate the usefulness of the D4Science based VREs for this agro-climatic science domain, using crop growth simulation and crop phenology estimation as characteristic use cases, with specific attention to Open Science. Based on the needs of the use cases a VRE has been composed and further developed in an iterative approach and evaluated at the end of each implementation cycle. Both the development work and the evaluation results point at the foreseen potential benefits of adequate VREs and the current existence of sufficient opportunities and capabilities for constructing them. The focus when developing VREs should be on supporting research with proven and stable tools, instead of striving to include the latest and greatest. The agro-climatic research domain has ambitious requirements concerning the availability and integration of data and models, which proved to be particularly challenging for incorporating in a VRE. Yet, a clear but gradual adoption of digital techniques to further the science itself is happening and VREs represent an ultimate possible end-state of Open Science. To conclude, this paper provides a few recommendations that we think can help this ongoing transition.",

    "abstract": "Policy measures have been taken to improve water quality in the Netherlands. These measures include the abolishment of derogation, which allowed dairy farmers to go beyond the maximum application of 170 kg nitrogen (N) from organic fertiliser per hectare, and additional measures of the 7th Nitrates Action program. Grass-clover swards, known for their symbiotic N fixation, could be a strategy to deal with stricter N policies and can potentially improve the environmental sustainability and economic viability of Dutch dairy farms. The aim was to assess the effects of stricter N policies on the farm structure, farm income and environmental performance of a representative Dutch dairy farm on a sandy soil, and to assess the effect of incorporating perennial ryegrass-red white clover (GCrw) swards and perennial ryegrass-white clover (GCw) swards into the grassland management of this farm using a model. A whole-dairy farm linear programming model was used with the objective function to maximize farm income. The model was combined with a farm nutrient balance and life-cycle assessment to determine the impact on nutrient surpluses and greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled a representative Dutch dairy farm with perennial ryegrass (PRG) before and after implementing stricter N policies. Thereafter, the implications of implementing GCrw and GCw swards was assessed. Including the policy measures increased the share of maize land (+12%), decreased the number of dairy cows (-9 cows), reduced farm income (€-18,858 yr-1), led to similar greenhouse gas emissions (∼800 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) per tonne (t) of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM)), and resulted in a lower N surplus (-65 kg ha-1 yr-1) and phosphate surplus (-4.4 kg ha-1 yr-1) for a scenario with only PRG. The use of GCrw and GCw swards could partly compensate for the reduction in farm income (€+9,255 up to +14,706 yr-1). A combination of PRG, GCrw and GCw resulted in the highest farm income. The use of grass-clover swards only had the most positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions (767 kg CO2-eq t-1 FPCM) and N surplus (113 kg ha-1 yr-1). Sensitivity analysis showed the importance of yields and feed characteristics on the obtained farm income. Grass-clover swards might partly compensate for the negative economic consequences of stricter N policies for Dutch dairy farms. Furthermore, implementing grass-clover swards reduced the GHG emission intensity of milk, but not always nutrient surpluses per hectare of farm land.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and extreme weather events undermine smallholder household food and income security in many rural areas of developing countries. Nature-based solutions and the use of climate resilient and nutrient dense Neglected and Underutilized Species into the local farming system have been claimed to sustainably help farmers adapt to climate change and to manage risk more effectively. This paper investigated the potential implementation of three options based on the collective cultivation and management of olive groves and wild forests for production purposes in a mountain region of Nepal. The analysis was aimed at assessing the potential benefits of such strategy in comparison with the status-quo. The study conducted an ex-ante simulation exercise for evaluating three options: 1) 1500 ha of new and restored wild forests; 2) 500 ha of olive groves; and 3) A combination of option 1 and 2. We calculated the financial, economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of such options using agricultural and economic data collected from representative households identified from a sample of 31 small, 9 medium, and 3 large farm households. To conduct the economic, social and environmental analysis (ESE), we calculated the Social Return on Investment and we integrated it into the economic analysis. Then we compared the results to assess which was the most profitable option. The results of the analysis showed that all three proposed options are stable with an Internal Rate of Return always above 27% with values over 100%. The greatest increase in terms of NPV is observed when shifting from the financial to the ESE analysis in options 1, 2, and 3 (+397.5%, +132.0%, +187.2% respectively) as the benefits increase more than the costs. The results further suggested that the integrated option is the most profitable one also in terms of labour generation. Indeed, we observed a substantial increase in the Return to Labour indicator especially in the ESE analysis (from 1.9 in the financial analysis to 2.8 in the economic analysis to 6.0 in the ESE analysis). This study provides evidence of the potential that similar strategies based on the use of local resources and species, if properly designed, implemented and managed, may have to restore the ecosystem and enhance the livelihoods of local communities. The most innovative element of this study is the proposed ESE analysis, which takes into account the social and environmental dimension besides the economic one.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for beef in Indonesia, driven by population growth, urbanisation, and an emerging middle class, provides a significant opportunity for Indonesian smallholder cattle farmers. Effective innovation in the cattle sector is required to meet this demand and improve the livelihoods of local farmers. This study aimed to understand whether and how Research for Development (R4D) projects can act as innovation intermediaries that enhance the performance of Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) in the Indonesian beef sector. As a case study, we used an R4D project conducted in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB), Indonesia to explore the best practices and opportunities for improvement. We qualitatively analysed data from the R4D project using six innovation intermediary functions. This case study partially succeeded in performing intermediary innovation functions. Strengths were noted in capacity building, provision of problem-solving information, and facilitation of collaborative knowledge generation. However, shortcomings were apparent in stakeholder engagement and in effectively addressing farmers' needs. R4D projects play a complex role as innovation intermediaries. A greater focus on participatory approaches, stakeholder engagement, and tailoring strategies to specific local conditions is required to achieve a significant impact. This research highlights the operational intricacies and success determinants of innovation intermediaries in Indonesia's cattle farming sector. By adopting a recognised functional approach, we elucidate the challenges and potential of R4D projects, emphasising the necessity of sustained engagement and diverse stakeholder involvement.",

To demonstrate the value of this technique, a model is applied to determine optimal net benefits of controlling East Coast fever (ECF) in Malawi Zebu cattle in the Lilongwe plateau. The objective function was the present value of net benefits due to treatment, defined as mortality savings minus treatment costs. Mortality savings were based on decreased mortality from ECF following treatment. Model constraints included herd size, animal (herd) nutritional requirements, and program budget. Treatment options were tank dipping in acaricide, and vaccination. Secondary data from a dipping trial of 1800 Malawi Zebu cattle conducted from 1991 to 1994 were used to determine probabilities of mortality. Total optimal net benefits of long-term treatment (25 years, i = 10%) from vaccination (Malawi Kwacha (MK) 21 069) exceeded benefits for treatment with chlorfenvinphos acaricide (MK15 203).",

    "abstract": "The semi-arid mulga lands of the Southern Rangelands of Western Australia experience frequent droughts. Maintaining a profitable animal grazing enterprise whilst preserving rangeland condition requires selecting an appropriate stocking rate and herd structure. We construct and apply bioeconomic models of beef enterprises for the semi-arid Southern Rangelands of Western Australia, to assess the profitability and relative riskiness of three different livestock production systems and three different stocking rates when exposed to different frequencies of drought. We construct bio-economic models of herd structures that separately focus on producing either: (i) 200 kg heifers and 210 kg steers (ii) live export of 340 kg heifers and 380 kg steers, or (iii) 500 kg heifers and 560 kg steers for local slaughter. The models are applied to assess the financial and production resilience of each herd structure for three different stocking rates, given the incidence of drought and various price scenarios. Comparing the three herd structures, option (iii) produces more kilograms of beef at an equivalent grazing pressure and recovers fastest from drought. Considering cattle prices over the 7-year period ending in 2021, live export and slaughter production systems generate comparable financial returns to graziers' actual reported results. Under two different scenarios of future prices, option (iii) provides the most profitable outcome. Applying a stocking rate that is 66% of a recommended stocking rate allows use of residual rangeland feed (known as 'haystack') during drought, generates greater profit, and produces a more stable herd size and income. Not matching the haystack with the longest modelled drought reduces the grazier's average annual profit by $172,000. The optimum herd structure identified in this study targets the production of 500 kg heifers and 560 kgs steers for local slaughter, and relies on a conservative stocking rate that leaves enough haystack to increase resilience if ever consecutive droughts occur. In the Southern Rangelands of Western Australia, there are financial and environmental merits in a herd structure that produces heavy steers and heifers for local slaughter yet is underpinned by conservative stocking rates.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the process of the transformation of agricultural systems in post-communist Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. It focuses on the survival of large agricultural firms, known as corporate farms, during periods of economic liberalization, privatization, land reform, and the restructuring of economies and the agricultural sector. The survival of corporate farms plays a significant role in driving structural changes within the farming sector and facilitating the transition from centrally planned to market-driven farming systems in the respective countries. The study investigates the factors correlated to the survival of corporate farms based on cross-country data analysis for 17 CEE countries. The survival of corporate farms can be correlated with a combination of farm-specific characteristics, sector-specific factors within the agricultural industry, country-specific natural and other resource endowments, and external factors related to a conducive economic environment. The study examines the viability of corporate farms by utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing 17 CEE countries between 2007 and 2019. The accelerated failure time model is employed to estimate the survival probabilities of these farms. The study uses the Nelson-Aalen estimator to calculate the cumulative hazard function and Kaplan-Meier survival function. Additionally, the baseline estimation of the two-level mixed-effects Weibull accelerated failure time model is utilized. Furthermore, estimations are conducted under various assumptions regarding sample restriction to ensure the robustness of the results. We find remarkable differences in corporate farm survival rates among 17 CEE countries. We document that legal format, ownership structure, and corporate finance indicators are highly relevant to corporate farm survival. Estimations reveal the non-linear correlation between corporate-farm size and age and their survival. We show that agricultural factor endowments and agricultural trade openness exhibit statistically significant and economically meaningful correlations with the survival probability of the sample farms. Farm-, sector- and country-specific factors play a crucial role in agri-food production, as well as regional and global food security. Diverse agricultural system structures may be associated with distinct farm attributes, various agricultural sector- and country-specific factors, and diverse allocations of agricultural resources. Better agricultural factor endowments and a conducive macroeconomic environment can foster comparative advantages and enhance corporate farm viability and survival. The findings of this study may be of significance to scholars and practitioners who are interested in comprehending the shifts in agricultural farm structures within agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Egyptian agriculture is challenged by increasing demands from a rapidly expanding population, and insufficient water and arable land resources, exacerbated by the expected impact of climate change further reducing these resources. Recent government policy has focused on large projects to meet increasing demand, with a reduced focus on the livelihoods and economic sustainability of low-income farmers. Insights into variations and changes within the farming population are needed to improve the effectiveness of policies to meet these challenges. This research aims to understand the heterogeneity within farming households in Egypt, to determine the characteristics which best describe these variations, and to trace developments within the sector over recent years and their dependencies on contextual factors. We performed a typology analysis based on the 2012 and 2018 Egyptian labour market panel surveys, identifying and using 12 categorical and 31 continuous variables to describe farming households. Highly skewed continuous variables were transformed, and highly correlated variables were removed. Subsequently, a factor analysis was carried out to determine which variables contribute the most to variation within the dataset. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify the number of clusters and a cluster analysis was carried out to define the clusters. The evolution of the clusters was determined by tracking the households present in both surveys and determining how their type changed between the two surveys. The variables which contributed the most to the variation within the household population were the degree of income diversification, cropping intensity, and water use per unit area. The clustering analysis resulted in four clusters being identified, which were specialised farming, village farming, diversified income, and landlord households. High levels of abandonment of farming were identified, with 45% of households abandoning agricultural activity in 2018 having participated in agriculture in 2012. There was a clear trend towards greater income diversification with 59% of households new to farming in 2018 being part of the diversified income household cluster. The analysis demonstrates a clear trend away from dependence on agricultural income, presenting risks to the sustainability of small-holder farming. Using the characteristics of the household types, this research presents policymakers with the opportunity to simulate responses to policies targeting greater water use efficiency, and increased income for the lowest-income households, and investigate how to meet increasing demand most efficiently. Additionally, it reinforces the global trend towards reduced participation in agricultural activities due to environmental and socioeconomic challenges.",

    "abstract": "Adjusting crop planting dates and variety durations is emerging as a crucial climate change adaptation strategy for many cereal systems. Such strategies include harmonizing crop planting with the onset of the rainy season or planting at specific recommended calendar dates. Evaluations of these strategies mostly consider yield and yield variability, but focus less on financial risks associated with different planting strategies and importance of risk aversion behaviour of the farmers in their decision to adopt the strategies. Here, we present a novel framework that uses a computational spatial ex-ante approach for risk-based evaluations of agronomic adaptation options. This framework allows development agronomic adaptation recommendations that consider climate risks for risk-averse famrers. We use a second order stochastic dominance approach that is paired with computational optimization—Golden section search algorithm. This approach allows a distributional assessment of risk and uncertainty by providing bounds at which even a risk averse would benefit from changing practices. This contrasts with conventional methods that do not consider farmers' risk aversion, e.g. mean-variance or conditional value at risk optimization methods. To demonstrate our approach, we compare the yield risks and economic risks associated with readily available gridded crop simulation outputs for various rice planting strategies across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP)– a major region experiencing food insecurity and climate impacts. The findings provide quantitative evidence about the riskiness of previously recommended rice planting date strategies. The risk-based assessment corroborates the recommendation for planting long-duration varieties at the monsoon onset with or without supplemental irrigation (covering about 22% of IGP area) in the Eastern IGP, and at state-recommended planting dates (covering about 38% of IGP area) in most of the Western and Middle IGP. Importantly, our risk-based assessment shows where the results are not as clear cut and which strategy is the least risky. This is especially important in the Middle IGP where farmers appear to have more flexibility to achieve comparable outcomes with several planting strategies. In conclusion, the proposed approach provides a useful and novel tool for comparing different agronomic climate adaptation strategies from an economic risk perspective in a spatial framework.",

    "abstract": "Pastoral and agro-pastoral (PAP) systems in East Africa face a range of challenges including increased climate variability. Various measures have been proposed to improve the resilience of pastoral/agro-pastoral (PAP) systems to drought. However, identifying the most effective measure for a given system and location is complicated, and tools are required to appraise measures on a consistent basis. This paper develops a model of a PAP system and uses it to assess the effects of four measures (Index-based livestock insurance, IBLI; Commercial destocking with an early warning system, EWS; Rangeland restoration, RR; Fodder planting, FP) on the resilience of the PAP system. It also quantifies the greenhouse gas (GHG) effects of the measures, thereby identifying potential trade-offs and synergies between the policy objectives of resilience and climate smart agriculture (CSA). A dynamic model of the Borena pastoral cattle system was developed to undertake the analysis. At its core is a herd model that calculates the changes in cattle population over time. Feed availability and drought occurrence affect fertility and mortality rates, which in turn determine the population and (meat and milk) production. A suite of indicators covering the three dimensions of CSA (increasing productivity, enhancing resilience and reducing GHG emissions) were developed, and used to compare the situation with and without measures. Destocking with an early warning system provides the biggest increases (relative to the no measure situation) in production and profit, due to the way it changes the herd size and structure. It maintains a larger herd than any of the other measures, and a greater proportion of the herd are adult females. Fodder planting and rangeland restoration provide moderate increases in production and profit. Index-based livestock insurance provides a moderate increase in protein production, but has no effect on profit, as it is designed to reduce risk rather than increase productivity or profit, at least in the short term. All of the measures increase the total emissions relative to the no measure scenario. In terms of the three dimensions of climate-smart agriculture, IBLI leads to some improvements in productivity and resilience but leads to large increases in total emissions, and modest increases in emissions intensity (EI). EWS leads to large increases in productivity and resilience. However, it also leads to large increases in total emissions and a mixed effect on EI. FP and RR improve productivity and increase total emissions, while having little effect on EI or resilience. This paper illustrates the way in which systems dynamic model can be used to appraise measures designed to improve resilience. The result identify potential synergies and tensions between the goals of resilience and climate smart agriculture, and raises the question of whether fully climate-smart goals are viable in these systems.",
