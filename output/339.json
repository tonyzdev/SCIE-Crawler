    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine the woody composition of, and elephant (Loxodonta africana) damage to, the major vegetation types within the study area, and to relate the damage to elephant densities and chemical composition of bark, leaves and soil. Vegetation composition and elephant damage were assessed by means of belt transects in ten vegetation types. In each transect, data collected for tree species were stem diameter, height, canopy diameters and canopy depth. For shrubs, height and canopy diameters were measured. Damage was considered as being old (more than 1 year) and new (since the previous rainy season), and was further divided into that due to elephant and to unknown agents. Each individual plant was assigned to one of seven classes, ranging from no damage to plants that were dead. Damage was weighted according to the size of the individuals, using stem area for trees, and the reconstructed canopy volume for shrubs. It was calculated for all species separately and together, for each vegetation type. Total old and new elephant damage to trees in all vegetation types together amounted to 33,9 percent and 4,1 percent respectively (weighted by the area of different damage classes), and was 33,8 percent and 7,5 percent for the shrubs. The pattern of old elephant damage to trees in the study area has been mapped. It appears that elephant damage is not related to the chemical constituents analysed in the vegetation and in the soil, except for a low positive correlation with sodium in the soil. Furthermore, there was little relationship between densities and elephant damage, although this may have been due to the elephant density figures applying to too large an area. If the vegetation types in the research area are to be preserved, reduction of the elephant population is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Augmenting natural water supplies by providing artificial waterpoints is an intervention commonly adopted by managers of national parks and other large protected areas. Contrasting policies are currently being followed in three of the premier national parks in southern Africa. Some empirical guidelines for waterpoint provision are suggested by case histories of these and other wildlife reserves. A geometric model, based on the rotation of water-dependent herbivores between wet season and dry season ranges, is outlined to indicate the appropriate spacing between perennial waterpoints. The aim is to apportion vegetation impacts evenly between these ranges, and allow plants a period of recovery from severe grazing pressure. The model suggests that a much wider spacing between perennial water sources is advisable than is currently operative in most conservation areas. Seasonal waterpoints reduce the period of concentration near perennial water, but prolong use of vegetation in the wet season range. Excessive waterpoints (1) favour water-dependent ungulates and elephants at the expense of rarer ungulates, (2) increase predator impacts on prey populations, (3) widen vegetation degradation, (4) worsen animal mortality during droughts, (5) decrease ecosystem stability, and (6) lead to a loss of biodiversity.",

They select a wide range of species, generally eating the species in quantities proportional to their occurrence within the woodlands although some specific species are positively selected or avoided. Because most of the feeding is carried out on vegetation below 2m, elephant compete directly with other herbivores occurring in the same habitat where food requirements of animal species in fact overlap. Males in particular push over trees and can account for nine trees each per day in the dry season, or 4,5 trees per day throughout the year. Social display by males appears to be in part the reason for the uprooting of trees.",

The 19-year programme comprised seven phases, commencing with a description of the effect of the cats on the Marion Island ecosystem, the characteristics of the cat population and the formulation of a management policy (phase 1: 1974-1976). Methods for control were selected and preparations were made for the implementation of the primary control mea- sure, biological control with the feline panleucopaenia virus (phase 2: 1976/77). The virus was released in 1977 (phase 3: 1977), followed by the determination of its effects (phase 4: 1977-1980). Monitoring of the effects of the virus continued, and the secondary control measure of hunting at night was tested (phase 5: 1981-1983). Full-scale implementation of hunting and continued monitoring of the effects of both the disease and hunting followed (phase 6: 1986-1989). The inclusion of intensive trapping and poisoning as tertiary control measures culminated in the final eradication of cats from Marion Island in 1991 (phase 7: 1989-1993).",

    "abstract": "Aggregate estimates for wildlife populations and species diversity on private land in Namibia were made for 1972 and 1992, using questionnaire surveys. Animal numbers and biomass appear to have increased by some 80%, or 3% per annum, over the period. The number of game species recorded increased by 44%. Cost-benefit analysis models were developed and used to analyse economic and financial efficiency of land use involving wildlife on private land. Financial profitability was generally low in the case of both livestock-game production for consumptive use and wildlife production for non-consumptive use. However these activities appear to be economically efficient, and result in a positive contribution to national income. The results suggest that there are financial incentives for private landholders to group together and form large scale conservancies. The latter benefit from economies of scale which make them more financially profitable and robust, and also more economically efficient, than ranches. Wildlife production for non-consumptive wildlife viewing yielded greater economic net value added per unit of land than livestock-wildlife production for consumptive use, particularly at the larger conservancy scale of operation. Aggregate estimates, in 1994 prices, of the annual net value added to national income from wildlife use on private land are N$ 30.6 million in 1972 and N$ 56 million in 1992. The economic value of wildlife use as a proportion of the total value of private land rangeland use has risen from 5% to 11% over the 20-year period. Current policy to promote both wildlife use and the development of wildlife conservancies on private land appears to be economically sound.",

    "abstract": "The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has long been regarded as a significant threat to the interests of farmers of both game and livestock in Namibia and for this reason has been removed in large numbers. However, the diet of these cheetahs has not been documented; such documentation is an important component of any effective conservation plan. We performed feeding trials to relate more accurately the remains found in cheetah scats to the number of prey animals consumed. Using scat analysis techniques, we found that cheetah prey size ranged from birds and hares to large antelope. They rarely preyed on domestic stock, with apparent selection towards common, indigenous game species. Information gathered from aerial sightings of kills was significantly biased towards larger prey species. Data on the number of times cheetahs were seen near livestock or game were found to not be representative of the type of prey taken when compared to corrected scat analysis. Due to the diurnal nature and wide-ranging habits of cheetahs, they are sighted relatively frequently near stock, which may contribute to an exaggerated perception of their predation on stock. From the results of this study, livestock predation by cheetahs was estimated to account for at least 0.01 calves and 0.004 sheep per km on the Namibian farmlands, and may be substantially more depending on cheetah density. Any stock losses as a result of cheetahs and other predators can have economic impacts for farmers, and management techniques for mitigating such losses are suggested. The use of controlled feeding trials and subsequent calculation of a correction factor for scat analysis could be a valuable tool for gaining a more accurate estimate of carnivore diet in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding spatial ecology is fundamental to effectively managing large, wide-ranging carnivores such as the leopard (Panthera pardus) . While numerous studies have been conducted on leopards within protected areas, more information regarding leopard ecology is needed outside such areas for effective conservation. This study examined the spatial ecology of leopards living on commercial Namibian farmlands, and assessed information from other studies to investigate which factors appeared to influence leopard range size and density. Home range sizes were particularly large in Namibia, with high range overlap, and neither sex exhibited exclusive home range use. There were no significant differences in range size between males and females, or between wet and dry seasons for either sex. Rainfall did not directly affect range size, but exerted an influence via prey biomass. Leopard density was positively correlated with prey biomass and negatively related to range size. Leopards showed marked variation in range size and land tenure systems between studies, reflecting their remarkable ecological flexibility. Nevertheless, large home range sizes and low population densities mean that leopards require large, contiguous tracts of suitable habitat, and that more conservation efforts must be extended beyond protected areas to ensure the long-term viability of leopard populations in such areas.",

    "abstract": "South Africa is one of only seven countries with a viable population of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). The national population in 2017 was 372 adults and yearlings and comprised three subpopulations: 1) Kruger National Park (Kruger), 2) an intensively managed metapopulation established through reintroductions into isolated, fenced reserves, and 3) a free-roaming population that occurs naturally outside protected areas. We assessed the long-term (four wild dog generations, ∼20 years) trends in population size and growth rate within each of these three subpopulations. We found that Kruger supports a substantial population, which has declined over time. The metapopulation is the only subpopulation that has increased significantly over time (both in population size and number of packs), likely due to intensive conservation efforts and the reintroduction of wild dogs into 15 additional reserves since 1998. The free-roaming subpopulation has remained small but stable, even though the number of packs has declined due to anthropogenic threats. The overall national population has remained stable even though the number of packs has increased. Kruger has consistently supported the highest proportion of the national population over the last two decades. However, the contribution of the metapopulation has increased significantly over time. It is clear that despite differences in survey effort among the three subpopulations, South Africa has a small (∼500) but stable population of wild dogs, with the metapopulation contribution becoming increasingly important. The circumstances in the country necessitate, and demonstrate the benefit of, intensive, adaptive management for the national population of wild dogs. While this assessment provides baseline information for the three subpopulations, wild dog conservation in South Africa would benefit greatly from equal survey effort and standardized methods to accurately assess long-term population trends.",

They do not consider game meat as a ‘regular’ type of meat, but rather as an exotic, seasonal product. Furthermore, South African consumers indicated that they are not willing to pay more for game meat than other types of meat. South African consumers indicated that they consider the fat content of meat as an important quality when they purchase meat, as they aspire towards consuming lean meat. This research not only shows that South African consumers are ill-informed regarding the positive attributes of game meat, but also that producers and marketers of game meat are not doing enough to promote game meat. This provides an excellent opportunity for game meat producers and marketers, as game meat is lower in fat than pork, lamb or beef.",

We investigated the fence's effectiveness in separating humans and wildlife, as evidenced by the fence transgression frequencies of different hole-digging and conflict species. Since the fence prevents access to long stretches of river along the national park boundary, fence transgressions for lions (Panthera leo), elephants (Loxodonta africana) and all the digging species were higher during the dry season when there was no surface water available in the park. Conversely, cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) crossed the fence and moved into the park in high numbers during the rainy season, probably to access grazing. Wildlife damage to the fence was highest in the dry season and without the implementation of prompt and constant maintenance and repair, game fences such as the Boteti fence cannot be effective in alleviating human—wildlife conflict.",

Waterhole visitation patterns differed according to time of day, but this effect remained relatively constant between seasons. More animals visited waterholes in the dry season compared to the wet season. Carnivore presence negatively affected impala abundance. Elephant presence did not affect impala and white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) visits to waterholes. Water quality also appeared to play a role in determining animal abundance.

    "abstract": "Leopards (Panthera pardus) are the most widely distributed wild felid in the world, living sympatrically with numerous competitively dominant species in various large carnivore guilds. Leopards generally feed on small to medium-sized ungulates and risk kleptoparasitism from intraguild competitors. One unique, adaptive response to intraguild competition is arboreal caching ('hoisting') by leopards. Hoisting behaviour is thought to vary in frequency among individuals, populations, and between sexes. In our study, leopards fed primarily (85% of observed kills) on impala (Aepyceros melampus), which is the most locally abundant potential prey species. Although we did not detect statistical differences in hoisting rates among individuals within each sex, our results confirmed moderate hoisting rates of 35% in an area with medium densities of lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Sex differences in prey hoisting were related to size, and males as the larger sex, hoisted kills (47.7%, n = 44) more often than overlapping females (27%, n = 62). Female leopards hoisted 25–33% of detected kills irrespective of prey size, season, habitat type, presence of dependent cubs, or location in relation to high competitor density areas ('competitor hotspots'). Consistent with this, males hoisted kills more often where visibility and, therefore, probability of detection was highest. We conclude that hoisting is likely correlated with energetic costs, seasonally increased detection by competitors, and direct competitor interactions rather than the potential risk of conflicts within generalized areas of high competitor use ('hotspots').",

    "abstract": "Previous vegetation studies in the Kruger National Park have shown a dramatic decline in the density of large trees in four major vegetation units of the Park. An assessment of the damage status of Sclerocarya birrea (marula), identified as one of the most important tree species in the Kruger National Park, was conducted across three major landscapes of the Park. Previous studies indicated that marula were most utilized by elephants, resulting in weak regeneration and recruitment, with consequent changes to the population structure of the species. Furthermore, results indicated that the marula populations in two major landscapes of the Kruger National Park were threatened. The objective of this study was to generate a data set, which can be used in conjunction with future monitoring, to quantify the elephant damage to the marula population in the Kruger National Park. Results indicated that almost half the surveyed population suffered from damage due to elephant activity, predominantly in the form of bark stripping and felling. Felling resulted in a large proportion of marula trees being reduced to a height of less than five metres. Main stem breakage by elephant was the main cause of the 7% mortality observed in the marula population.",

    "abstract": "This paper is an expanded version of the paper presented at the Second International Symposium on African Wildlife, Research and Management, held on 7 July 1977 at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. The conservation of genetic variability has, until recently, played an insignificant role in most wildlife management policies, except perhaps where endangered plants or animals are involved. Even then, it was motivated by sentiment and by the traditional fear that loss of variability or heterozygosity (LOH) may lead, through inbreeding depression, to extinction. Evidence is put forward that the conservation of genetic variation should be the prime consideration in the implementation of a nature conservation policy, for ecological, taxonomic and aesthetic reasons. This is best achieved by conserving the genetic integrity of population units somewhere between the hierarchical levels of deme and subspecies without unnecessary genetic admixture. It is suggested that the unthinking mixing of subspecies or ecotypes by 'conservation oriented' translocations is both biologically indefensible and ecologically harmful. The survival of life in a changing world depends upon evolution which in turn is completely dependent upon the existence of a full spectrum of genetic variation.",

Passage disturbance led to egg loss through predation by kelp gulls Larus dominicanus and invariably frightened nest prospecting penguins away from the colony after the third or fourth intrusion, regardless of the interval between intrusions. Birds were disturbed and occasionally left the colony when an observer was less than 30 m from the edge of a high-density colony. Adult birds reacted most to a slow, direct approach and chicks to a staggered approach. The exodus rate of birds was higher at coastal than inland colonies, where no exodus was recorded. Results are discussed in relation to the conservation of the jackass penguin.

A total of 991 roadkill were recorded on the paved roads and 36 roadkill on the unpaved roads. Identifiable roadkill comprised 162 species from 24 orders and 65 families. Ninety-three roadkill could not be identified to species level. Roadkill counts were strongly influenced by road type and season. More roadkill was recorded on the paved than the unpaved roads. Irrespective of road type, the proportion of roadkill was greatest in the hot/wet season (4.3 paved roadkill/km/day paved and 1.3 roadkill/km/day unpaved) and lowest in the cold/dry season (2.0 roadkill/km/day paved and 0.1 roadkill/km/day unpaved). The high numbers of vertebrates identified as roadkill suggests that road traffic has the potential to directly and negatively affect biodiversity conservation in this part of South Africa. We recommend continued roadkill data collection across South Africa to assist with creating an inventory of species most likely to be at risk from roads. This will, in turn, better inform the implementation of potential mitigation measures.",

    "abstract": "Wildlife tourism provides an opportunity to offset conservation costs and promote co-existence between people and wildlife. To promote conservation through wildlife tourism, one can use flagship species; charismatic species that increase awareness and public recognition of a site, and stimulate financial and political support for conservation. Due to their large area requirements and sensitivity to disturbance, promoting conservation of large carnivores automatically promotes conservation of other species, and the use of large carnivores as flagship species has been positively related to ecosystem conservation. In this study, we interviewed wildlife tourists to determine which large carnivores could serve as flagship species for the Zimbabwe component of the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA), an area that is expected to become a premier tourist destination and make a significant contribution to conservation. Based on likability and the possibility to raise funds and promote the area, lion (Panthera leo) was the most suitable flagship species, closely followed by leopard (Panthera pardus). Spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) was the least suitable flagship species. Despite its endangered status, African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) did not seem to have a high potential to serve as a flagship species for the area. Although cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) was less often mentioned as a species tourists were hoping to see or a favourite species seen, cheetah was liked as much as lion and leopard and provided similar potential to raise funds and promote the area. Flagship species status does not have to apply to a single species, it can also successfully apply to a cohort of species. With the KAZA TFCA being in the unique position of harbouring the largest free-roaming cheetah population in Zimbabwe, it would be appropriate if the area was promoted by using large cats as a flagship species cohort.",

    "abstract": "Large carnivores are frequently reintroduced into protected areas to compensate for anthropogenic-driven losses. The lack of post-release monitoring has impeded our knowledge on how these carnivores adapt to their new environment, which often results in uncertainty of whether or not reintroductions were successful. Between 2011 and 2012, six leopards (Panthera pardus) and three lions (Panthera leo) were reintroduced into Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, and each animal was fitted with a GPS or VHF collar to monitor their post-release movements and behaviour. All individuals survived longer than two and a half years post-release and successful breeding events were recorded for all females, except one leopard. Released felids showed little initial exploratory behaviour, none homed to their capture location and all individuals displayed at least some degree of release site fidelity. Lions established permanent ranges between five and seven months after release, with a mean home range of 82.1km2 (95%, T-LoCoH). Three leopards established permanent ranges between four and eight months, with a mean home range of 181.6 km2 (95%; T-LoCoH). Two leopards did not establish fixed home ranges, but rather exhibited continuous shifts in range which were likely due to natural disruptive events such as season, prey availability and other competitors. Our findings suggest that reintroduced felids may take longer to establish permanent home ranges than previously thought, highlighting the importance of long-term post-release monitoring. Based on our study, reintroduction appears to be an effective and viable tool to restore large carnivores in protected areas in Malawi.",

The sample included 2528 elephants destroyed between 1970 and 1974, and 353 embryos and foetuses. Prenatal sex ratios and those of juveniles, sub-adults and adults did not differ significantly from 1:1. Most young bulls joined bachelor herds at about 15 years of age. Of the adult bull segment (16 years and older) 17,3 percent occur in breeding herds. Over a 4-year period 15,5 percent of the, population consisted of bachelor herds and lone bulls and 6,8 percent of the population were under 1 year of age. On an average (n = 4 years) 70 percent of all conceptions took place from November to April when 81 percent of the rain fell. The female pubertal interval for the population extended from 7 to 12 years of age, the mean age at maturity being 12 years. The youngest conception occurred at 7 years of age. Reproduction continued into old age although there was a drop in the conception rate of 51 to 60 years olds = 28,6 percent, in contrast to the 41,2 percent for 12 to 50 year olds (n = 722 cows). There was a gradual increase with age in the percentage of lactating cows up to about 20 years of age, whereas the suckling period for calves ended after 3 years of age (97,8 percent of all calves) The mean calving interval was 4,5 years and this varied from year to year but was similar for different parts of the Park. The left and right uterine cornua are equally active with a mean incidence of 3,41 placental scars/cow. Twin foetuses occurred in 2 out of 351 conceptions whereas there were 5 foetal abnormalities (1,42 percent). Present population density and cropping activities appear to have had no influence on the breeding rate of the population.",

A review of the densities, feeding and foraging ecology, as well as the relations between the large carnivores in the arid Kalahari, illustrates how they have successfully adapted to arid conditions, and highlights some of the differences in these relationships with those in more mesic areas. In the arid Kalahari, the relative densities of the large carnivores are more even, but community structure is different, with the inclusion of the brown hyaena (Hyaena brunnea) and the disappearance of the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Resource partitioning is more acute and diet flexibility is evident. The relative contribution to animals killed by predation is more equitably shared by the predator community, and high rates of food loss by smaller carnivores to larger ones has not been recorded. There is even an example of a smaller carnivore (brown hyaena) deriving benefits from a larger one (lion, Panthera leo). Arid regions are clearly important areas for large carnivores and more attention should be given to research and conservation of carnivores in arid areas.",

    "abstract": "The human population in Kenya has doubled over the last 25 years and is expected to rise two fold by 2050. Thus, pressure for human space has led to encroachment into wildlife habitats, increasing human—wildlife interactions. Such interactions pose serious health risks to both humans and wildlife, yet studies to understand these risks are limited in Kenya. To understand the possible predisposing factors for zoonoses at the human—wildlife interface, a survey was carried out in Nthongoni, an area bordering Tsavo and Chyulu Hills national parks in Kenya. Questionnaires were administered to 11 key informants and 200 residents from 35 villages. Our results indicate that the majority (75%) of the respondents suffered from crop raids and livestock depredation by wildlife. On their part, residents killed wildlife for: subsistence (41%), revenge (35%), bush-meat trade (22%), and other undisclosed reasons. Nineteen per cent of the respondents were knowledgeable about disease transmission through bush-meat. Qualitative data revealed helplessness, bitterness and revenge tendencies by farmers due to wildlife losses, which contributed to their poverty. This study enhances our understanding of human—wildlife interactions and the associated socioeconomic, health and conservation implications. It demonstrates the predicaments communities living adjacent to wildlife areas face and the need to involve them in sustainable management of the areas. We recommend identification of appropriate alternative livelihoods, to mitigate illegal bush-meat and agricultural practices that attract wildlife, leading to conflicts. In addition, responsive health and conservation education, and participatory research aimed at advising policy, are necessary to cushion the communities from wildlife damages.",

Many efforts to manage the impact of these predators are unsuccessful and no meaningful, or effective, long-term management programme has been formulated over any large area (spanning more than a single farm or a group of neighbouring farms) throughout their southern African range. This paper reports on the scientific information available on the ecology of black-backed jackals and caracals to evaluate the nature of current knowledge of these species in order to prioritize research for the development of meaningful human—predator conflict management (HPCM) strategies. From a HPCM perspective, it is evident that published field studies on black-backed jackals and caracals in southern Africa are limited in scope, spatially and temporally isolated, and generally old (appearing prior to 2005). Most studies were also mainly conducted in protected areas, with little information from farming areas. Significant ecological questions, relevant to HPCM are highlighted by our study. These questions include studying whether or not black-backed jackal and caracal territoriality persists under rangeland conditions?; Have the two predators 'learned' to predate on introduced livestock or wildlife?; Has reproductive behaviour changed under rangeland conditions?; and, Is compensatory breeding observed under rangeland conditions? Answers to these questions will undoubtedly contribute to the formulation of more effective HPCM strategies.",

Grazers had a lower intensity of infestation than browsers and intermediate feeders. The difference was most pronounced in the 30 to 150 kg weight range within which the grazers were predominantly short-grass grazers which utilize habitat less suitable for ticks.

All of these antelopes showed positive responses to fire, feeding on recently-burnt veld ( one year since last burnt). Differences in the rate and degree of response to veld burning were observed in the different antelopes and discussed in relation to food preferences and feeding styles. Higher nutritional value of recently-burnt veld and ease of accessibility of new growth are believed to be the main attractants to antelopes. The fire regime best suited to the vegetation, antelopes, and some other animal groups is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The capture of wild animals is a stressful event which may cause a capture-induced hyperthermia, resulting in morbidity or mortality. We investigated whether various cooling techniques were effective at lowering the body temperature of hyperthermic animals. To achieve this, we implanted miniature temperature-sensitive data loggers into the abdomens of 12 blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi). Five animals were cooled by dousing with water of different temperatures (4°C, 17°C, 28°C) and fanning after dousing with 28°C water. Seven animals were cooled by ice-packs, a fine mist spray of 28°C water, intravenous (IV) infusion of one litre of 4°C saline solution or 28°C water-dousing. The body temperature after capture was significantly elevated to as high as 41 °C to 42°C. Water-dousing interventions significantly decreased minimum body temperature but there was no difference in the minimum body temperature reached or the magnitude of cooling between the different water temperatures or by the addition of fanning. The ice-packs also lowered body temperature, whereas mist spraying did not. The use of ice packs and dousing with water between 4°C and 28°C were the most effective techniques to reduce capture-induced hyperthermia in blesbok. Water-dousing, when done appropriately, is the most practical and effective method to cool an animal with capture-induced hyperthermia.",

Using camera traps and track surveys in the Limpopo National Park, Mozambique, we collected detection/non-detection data of lions and their prey and combined these with occurrence data on bushmeat poaching activities and spatial data on agro-pastoralist land use and other landscape features. We used hierarchical modelling within an occupancy framework to determine the relative influences of ecological variables on resource use and non-use by lions at two spatial scales. Habitat use by lions was most strongly influenced by the occurrence of their preferred prey across both spatial scales. However, lions were strongly negatively predicted by bushmeat poaching at the finer spatial scale and generally negatively predicted by agro-pastoralist activities at the coarser scale. Restricting our analysis to the home-range scale would have greatly underestimated the impact of bushmeat poaching on the ecology of lions. The results of our study illustrate the trophic dependency of prey resources to lions and the importance of considering scale when investigating species habitat use. Importantly, our study also demonstrates the limiting influence of bushmeat poaching on the use of habitat by an apex predator.",

This study assessed the effect of land-use type on the relative abundance of House Sparrows in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, an urban area where they are invasive. It was predicted that House Sparrows in an urban environment would be more abundant at shopping malls compared with other habitats. Spot counts were done at shopping malls, schools, factories and suburban gardens throughout the year. House Sparrows were recorded frequently at shopping malls and rarely in suburban gardens. Type of urban land use appears to determine food and possibly nest site availability. This in turn affects the density, relative abundance, and distribution of House Sparrows. There appears no need to regulate this urban House Sparrow population because it has different feeding and breeding requirements to native birds, is not predatory, and is largely restricted to heavily transformed landscapes.",

Although widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa surprisingly few spotted hyaena populations have reliable estimates of population sizes, and almost nothing is known about the trends in hyaena numbers. In most areas, threats due to anthropogenic disturbance or diseases are therefore not possible to evaluate. We calibrated a call-up method designed to achieve unbiased counts of African lions (Panthera leo) to estimate spotted hyaena numbers simultaneously. This greatly reduces the time and cost of surveys for these two dominant large carnivores in African savannas. We evaluated the effect of preferred prey biomass, lion density and disease on spotted hyaena population abundance in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, and found evidence only for an effect of prey biomass. Our results suggest that the persistence of spotted hyaena is not threatened in the Kruger National Park.",

Through focal animal sampling we found that samango monkeys were predominantly frugivorous (72% of observed feeding time), consuming fruits of 25 plant species and dispersing the seeds of 13 (52%) of them through defecation, carrying in cheek pouches and spitting and dropping. The overall ratio of seed predation was relatively low (16%).

We conclude that this fence-gap design is effective at restricting rhinoceros movement and at permitting other wildlife movement into and out of the conservancy. We recommend that fenced-in rhinoceros conservancies that desire enhanced connectivity consider this fence-gap design to help re-connect their reserves to the outside landscape matrix while continuing to provide enhanced protection for their rhinoceroses.",

    "abstract": "We explored the perceptions held by subsistence farmers (living in communal lands within the CAMPFIRE programme area in northwestern Zimbabwe) towards the African lion (Panthera leo) and related conservation interventions undertaken by management authorities. Conceptually guided by the cognitive hierarchy, we used a semi-structured, face-to-face interview format to collect data across three different farming communities bordering Hwange and Zambezi National Parks. Ordinal regression models were used to analyse the data. Our results illustrate that farmers' perceptions towards lions were strongly negative and appeared to be associated with the geographic location in which the farmer lived, as well as the farmer's ethnic group. We also found that perceptions towards lions were not associated with specific livestock losses or to the potential benefits farmers received from wildlife conservation, e.g. school classroom blocks or road improvements. Instead, we suggest that fear of lions and perceived risk to livestock or human wellbeing may play a stronger role in shaping farmers' perceptions compared to actual livestock losses. Moreover, we suggest that sharing information across farmer social networks within a community area, along with the potential for media attention over sensational events, may also influence perceptions towards lions. Our results contribute a baseline dataset for future applied research in this area, and provide insight into developing locally-meaningful conservation interventions, including the type of information to be shared, channels for communication, and the benefits derived from participating in wildlife conservation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding animals' habitat selection and movement behaviours relative to human activities is important for evaluating resource requirements and ensuring effective conservation management. The world's largest remaining population of Kordofan giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum) reside in Zakouma National Park, Chad. However, it is unclear whether the park boundaries sufficiently encompass the full range of this population's preferred habitats. We used GPS telemetry data from 17 female giraffe over multiple years to better understand landscape and seasonal factors that influence their home range patterns and habitat preferences at multiple spatial scales. Kordofan giraffe seasonal ranges and core seasonal ranges were larger during the wet season and core utilization distributions had greater overlap with the national park in the dry season. The importance of shifts in seasonal habitat use, attributed to the flooding and drying that occurs within the park, necessitates Kordofan giraffe to move beyond the park's boundaries. Kordofan giraffe selected for open grasslands (mean coefficient = 0.48, 95% CI [0.22,0.74]), and increased their tortuosity of movement in these areas (mean coefficient = –0.18, 95% CI [–0.23,–0.14]). Conversely, with Vachellia savannas as the reference level for land-cover variables, the giraffe avoided anthropogenic areas, barren lands, Combretaceae savannas and forests. We advise increased community-based co-learning projects and awareness of giraffe outside the park. In addition, by identifying key habitat types that giraffe selected, we advise enhanced monitoring in preferred giraffe habitats during the wet season to protect these areas from being encroached by human settlement or agricultural expansion, with the support of the legal framework of the Bahr Salamat Wildlife Reserve and other agreements that protect wet season wildlife corridors.",

    "abstract": "African wildlife represents a unique type of terrestrial biodiversity whose current and future importance should not be underestimated. However, the future of wildlife in Africa is threatened as the largely protectionist approaches to conservation of this resource, which have been used for many years, are no longer viable. Local communities have had little or no role to play in the conservation of wildlife although they suffer from the inconveniences of sharing the same ecosystem with wildlife and receive a negligible share of the benefits that accrue from wildlife. Consequently, there is growing conflict between local communities and wildlife, whereby wildlife is not considered a priority form of land use since it does not offer immediate benefits to the local communities. In this paper we examine the issue of equitable sharing of benefits (and costs) of wildlife conservation in Africa, and the problems associated with local participation in the management of this resource with specific reference to Kenya and Zimbabwe. We further explore the issue of wildlife ownership and how this affects the local people's willingness to provide land for wildlife and hence its sustainable conservation. It is concluded that involvement and support of local communities in wildlife conservation is a prerequisite to effective and long-term conservation of wildlife and wildlands as part of the terrestrial biodiversity conservation. We propose that it is possible to reconcile the conservation of wild resources with economic development and human welfare so as to ensure that African countries with these resources have an incentive to ensure their long-term management and survival. New strategies for sustainable management of wildlife must address the issues of ownership as well as effective institutions and mechanisms of ensuring equitable sharing of benefits that accrue from wildlife.",

Issues over elephant conservation in general are controversial. Where poaching is less prolific and elephant are restricted to relatively small regions, the \nmain concern is that elephant could drastically alter their environment by destroying trees with the \npossibility of decreasing biological diversity. In this paper we show how the \nanalysis of transect data can help assess the \nimpact of newly introduced elephant. Trees utilized by elephant are highlighted. It is found that for the \nregion considered, only Sclerocarya birrea (marula) is being removed at a rate higher than 0.04 per annum (upper limit of annual regeneration). This tree is relatively rare and urgent work is needed to assess its status. Other rare trees should also be studied. the \ngeographical characteristics of the \nregion are fairly homogeneous, but the \nelephant impact on trees varies from one area to the \nnext. This discrepancy indicates that these differences are due to the \noverall behavioural characteristics of the \nelephant. For example, elephant were introduced to the \nregion recently and are still nervous with the \neffect that they congregate in areas of high tree density for protection. Other possible factors that could contribute to a non-homogeneous pattern of elephant impact on trees are also discussed.",

The magnitude of these differences was slight, but nevertheless operator bias would need to be checked if trends in cover were being monitored. Variation between replicate point surveys conducted by one observer was also assessed. The point surveys contacted no more than 60-70 % of plant species known to be present in the survey plots. This technique is therefore likely to underestimate plant species richness. As a result of improved rainfall grass tuft density showed a five-fold increase from November 1984 to December 1985. Grass canopy spread cover also showed a pronounced increase over this period. The implications of climate induced changes for the design of vegetation-monitoring programmes are discussed.",

We surveyed the West African chimpanzees outside protected areas in the Kedougou region of southeastern Senegal between November 2014 and July 2015 using recce walks (n = 57, totalling 300 km of pedestrian survey distance) in potential chimpanzee habitats. We recorded direct observations of chimpanzees or indices of chimpanzee activity, such as sleeping nests, footprints and faeces. We accumulated 21 direct contacts with chimpanzees and recorded 3489 chimpanzee nests. We mapped the distribution of chimpanzee sleeping sites and indicators of anthropogenic activity by regional administrative units to facilitate species management and conservation planning in the immediate future. In addition, we identified the habitats and tree species used by chimpanzees to construct their nests in order to explore nesting tree preferences. Chimpanzees used almost 40 tree species in the Kedougou region but 84% of nests were associated with eight tree species, namely Pterocarpus erinaceus, Diospyros mespiliformis, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Hexalobus monopetalus, Cola cordifolia, Lannea sp., Parkia biglobosa and Piliostigma thonningii. Among these eight nesting tree species, 60% of the corresponding nests were located in three species: P. erinaceus, D. mespiliformis and A. leiocarpus. Chimpanzees nested more often in woodland habitat than in gallery forests, although the latter accounts for only a small percentage of available habitat. This study is the most geographically extensive survey of chimpanzees in Senegal to date, broadening our knowledge of the species' northwestern-most distribution in West Africa.",

Leopard—livestock conflict is a contentious issue in the Baviaanskloof Mega-Reserve (BMR), South Africa. Little is known about the spatial distribution of livestock losses and the associated management responses by farmers. We investigated the vegetation-specific livestock predation by leopards in the BMR, as well as the consequences for livestock management and biodiversity preservation. Leopard killed livestock in 14 of the 22 vegetation types, of which Groot Valley Thicket, Cockscomb Mountain Fynbos and Baviaanskloof Mountain Fynbos were 'used' more than expected. Leopard predation was focused on the properties that bordered the reserve, but constituted a relatively small proportion of livestock losses on these properties. Farmers respond to this actual predation and perceived predation by removing livestock from areas bordering the reserve. Given the high levels of herbivory exerted on the vegetation by livestock, the removal of livestock may create plant refugia from herbivory. Thus, we propose that leopard predation may induce human-mediated behavioural effects on livestock which resembles the behavioural responses of herbivores to 'landscapes of fear'. Therefore, retaining top predators may assist in the conservation of biodiversity within multi-use landscapes by maintaining predator—prey dynamics and associated top-down processes.",

    "abstract": "Human-wildlife conflict and habitat loss are threatening carnivore populations in southern Africa, where the bulk of research focuses on large predators. However, scant research exists on medium and small carnivore (mesocarnivore) ecology. We employed hierarchical community modelling to estimate the effect of habitat on species occurrence and the effect of bait on detection probabilities for the carnivore community in the Mashatu Game Reserve, Botswana. We tested sites baited with either impala (Aepyceros melampus) meat (meat sites) or cheesecloth soaked in used cooking fat (fat rag sites) against unbaited sites (control sites). Within each bait classification, we divided our sampling effort between two habitat classifications, riverine and non-riverine sites. Thirteen of 16 carnivore species inhabiting the area (81%), including 10 of 12 species of mesocarnivore (83%), were recorded. Occupancy rates were higher in riverine habitat for several species, in particular African civet (Civettictis civetta), brown hyaena (Hyaena brunnea), and large-spotted genet (Genetta tigrina), demonstrating the importance of riverine habitat, which is declining in the study region. Our results suggest that the use of bait improves detectability. Several large carnivores, including spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), brown hyaena, and leopard (Panthera pardus), were detected at highest rates at meat sites. Many mesocarnivores, including black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and African civet responded equally to meat and fat rag sites, with detections greater than at control sites. Notably, large-spotted genet showed highest detection rates at fat rag sites, and brown hyaena showed higher rates at fat rag sites than control sites. Our detection results indicate that spent cooking fat may be used as an effective bait alternative to meat when studying mesocarnivore communities in southern Africa, whereas meat may still be the most effective for studying large carnivore communities. Identifying effective methods of increasing detection rates will benefit carnivore survey and monitoring initiatives, especially for cryptic species.",

Although the area in which these mortalities occurred is not protected and is considered a hotspot for human–elephant conflict and poaching, both malicious poisoning and poaching are unlikely to have played a role as other species were not affected, and elephant carcasses were found with tusks intact. In the absence of a confirmed cause we sought to identify the lines of enquiry that are most likely to lead to a definitive answer. In particular, we consider viral and bacterial agents that could precipitate species-specific mortalities on this scale, potential environmental sources of poisoning and the samples and tests that would assist in excluding/ confirming these candidate causes. Whilst it may be argued that these mortalities are unlikely to negatively impact the broader elephant population of ∼130 000 individuals in Botswana, the same cannot be said of the many vulnerable population pockets in other parts of Africa. For this reason, it is essential that the cause of the current die-off is identified as it is the only way to prevent similar losses of susceptible elephants elsewhere.",

We assess and review our results (and brown hyaena translocations in general) with respect to species ecology, previous translocations as well as monitoring data from resident conspecifics.

    "abstract": "Establishing historical baselines is important for informing present-day conservation and management actions. The historical literature was searched for information on the composition, abundance and distribution of the large ungulate fauna in the grassland-dominated Highveld region of north-central South Africa during the 19th century and early 20th century. The existence of large aggregations (herds comprising one or more taxa) is inferred from the written record, for the early historical period. These aggregations comprised one or more species of eight grazers or mixed feeders. There is weaker evidence of seasonal migratory, or partially migratory, behaviour by some of them. This synthesis highlights the existence of a major, but hitherto unrecognized and unheralded, grazergrassland system in the region, at least during the early period of colonial expansion. In global terms, this system may have rivalled similar extant migratory systems elsewhere in Africa and globally, if not in the numbers of animals involved then almost certainly in terms of the diversity of ungulates that were present. No records of large ungulate aggregations, or migrations, could be located for the post-1870s period, thus revealing the time of the collapse of this system, mainly as a result of overhunting and loss of habitat. By the end of the 19th century the once widespread and abundant larger ungulate fauna of the Highveld had, barring a few individuals and small and scattered herds, of a few species, been virtually exterminated. Some ecological consequences of this collapse are briefly discussed.",

High buffalo densities had been perceived as a potential competitive threat for grazing with co-existing populations of white rhino which have a high conservation status. Feeding behaviour was compared at different scales to identify exploitative competition or facilitation between the two study species; variables considered were use of grass species, grass height, and habitat preference. No significant differences were observed in the use of the common grasses Themeda triandra and Panicum maximum. However, resource partitioning occurred through use of grass of different height. Habitat facilitation was inferred from the observed interaction, since buffalo grazed grass to heights optimal for use by white rhino. Partitioning also occurred with reference to topography and gradient; white rhino occurred in valley bottoms, whereas buffalo displayed an even distribution across the catena. Resources were abundant during the study and no competition was evident between buffalo and white rhino. Management of the area optimises resource use.",

    "abstract": "Tourism to areas of natural beauty has recently been seen as one of the fastest growing interests in many countries around the world. This brand of tourism also encompasses celebrating and sharing with tourists the uniqueness and diversity of different cultures in areas visited. Through a case study of current tourism trends in Mkambati Nature Reserve on the Wild Coast, where an ambitious ecotourism project under the auspices of the Spatial Development Initiative (SDI) is planned, this paper attempts to emphasize the role played by local visitors in making ecotourism a success or failure. The study found that local tourists are currently the majority of visitors to Mkambati Nature Reserve. It also shows that while unimpressed with infrastructure and other services, local tourists are prepared to spend money to enjoy the quietness that is offered by protected environments. However, local tourists to Mkambati are not as enthusiastic about visiting and sharing experiences in adjacent rural areas. If based on current trends, then planning of ecotourism ventures should, at least initially, be based on local visitors’ patterns.",

Foraging parameters of Burchell’s zebra (Equus burchelli) and Impala (Aepyceros melampus) were collected to determine the intake rate, cropping rate and bite size through observation and bite count methods. Intake rates were 48.76 ± 0.49 g/min and 27.28 ± 0.22 g/min for the zebra and impala, respectively. Bite size and cropping rate for zebra were 1.93 ± 0.04 and 25.92 ± 0.30, respectively. For impala, they were 0.78 ± 0.01 and 35.20 ± 0.16, respectively. The maximum theoretical intake rate for zebra was 100.96 g/min and 77.32 g/min for impala. The foraging efficiency index was higher for impala (1.03) than zebra (0.61). For zebra to achieve a 63% intake satiation, forage biomass with a bite size of 1.65 g/bite was necessary, while for impala, biomass with a bite size of 0.97 g/bite was necessary. Zebra’s large intake rates, bite sizes and low foraging efficiency are possibly due to its bulk and unselective foraging. Impala’s high foraging efficiency, cropping rate and relatively low intake rate are associated with its relatively selective foraging strategy.",

By contrast, more than 5% of recoveries of redbilled teal Anas erythrorhyncha, Cape teal A. capensis, southern pochard Netta erythrophthalma and knob-billed duck Sarkidiornis melanotos had moved over 1 000km. Redbilled teal travel widely within southern Africa, but rarely far beyond, whereas median distance of movement by southern pochard is far greater, with numbers of birds reaching East Africa. Median movement of Cape teal is the lowest of any species, but some individuals are nomadic over considerable distances within southern Africa. Knob-billed duck are pronounced partial migrants, with nearly 10% of recoveries having moved over 2000 km and some birds reaching north-central Africa. The subspeciation patterns of these eight species correlate closely with the extent of movement revealed by ringing recoveries. Limited recoveries available for the ninth species, the whitefaced duck Dendrocygna viduata, indicate only very limited movements, but other evidence, including its lack of subspeciation over a huge world range, strongly suggest that a proportion of individuals in fact travel extensively.",

The capacity of rangelands to support ungulates is high for large sized and largely grazing species, and low for small sized and largely browsing species. The former type of animal appears an inefficient converter per unit mass of intake, but efficient per unit mass of primary production; the opposite holds for the latter type of animal. The methods of agriculturists to calculate an economically optimal stocking rate are applicable to wild ungulate production systems, and avoid the difficulties inherent in the classical ecological methods involving the intrinsic rate of natural increase, and ecological efficiency ratios. The agriculturalists' method may be extended to determine an economically optimal proportional animal species composition. Previous protagonists of game ranching have overemphasized the 'wild' vs. 'domestic' animals, under-emphasized the 'one or two species community' vs. 'complete community', paid insufficient attention to mixing compatible domestic and wild ungulates to create a complete community, and have misunderstood or ignored the effects of the properties of different ungulates, and of the system of management on animal production and range condition.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes how the Zimbabwe Natural Resources Act of 1941 nurtured a civic landholder-based conservation movement, the Intensive Conservation Area movement (ICA). This is not recorded in the published literature. It provides a rare insight into the efficacy of environmental regulation that legally devolves use rights and regulatory responsibility to communities of landholders, and favours democratic processes above top-down regulation. The main message is that natural resource governance is effective when (a) landholders are genuinely empowered with the rights to use and manage natural resources provided, and (b) this occurs within a framework of devolved and collective self-regulation through structures built democratically from the bottom up. The effectiveness of these structures is surprisingly sensitive to any reduction in democratic control. The ICA movement anticipates, and is aligned with, the emerging theories of common property, scale, management, systems thinking and new institutional economics. These have common roots in the principle that human affairs and complexity are best managed where hierarchies of nested institutions serve the bottom layers, not the top. This suggests that entitling landholders, including communities, with full choice to use and management natural resources, and relying on local collective action to control environmental abuses or externalities, will strengthen future approaches for natural resource governance, including for wildlife and southern Africa.",

Faecal samples were collected each month over a two year period in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve and during winter 1995 from five other roan populations. Samples were analysed with the NIRS procedure for nitrogen and fibres. The macrominerals Ca, P, K and Na were analysed with wet chemical analysis. The seasonal variation in faecal nitrogen and fibre, with a higher quality in summer (high protein and low fibre) is a reflection of the changing forage quality. Seasonal changes in macrominerals were not significant, but differences were found between populations residing in different geographical areas. Since all populations, other than that of the Nylsvley Nature Reserve, were artificially fed during winter, a generally higher faecal quality was found in these populations. It appears that artificial feeding during winter is advantageous for animals. Faecal analysis can be applied as a management tool to indirectly measure the forage quality. This study indicated that when monitoring seasonal changes in faecal quality or the effectiveness of a winter feeding programme for roan, only FN and faecal fibres need be measured. When comparing the diet quality between geographical areas, the measurement of macrominerals would be more appropriate.",

Hipposideros commersoni was observed to remain inactive at the roost for days without entering torpor or leaving the cave to forage. This large bat appears to over-winter by relying on its considerable fat store at this southern limit of its distribution.

During the dry year both tortoises used the vegetation in relation to its availability; grass was used extensively as were succulents. In the higher rainfall study period a greater variety of ephemerals was available. The mountain tortoise extended its use of available species but continued to use grass; this component disappeared completely from the diet of the serrated tortoise and they concentrated on herbs and succulents. Preference in both species is for succulents and species of the Fabaceae. Tribulus terrestris also featured in both diets in both periods.

    "abstract": "Ecotourism is widely assumed to provide a mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity. However, the perceptions of biodiversity by tourists have rarely been evaluated. We \nassessed this during self-guided wildlife viewing in the Addo Elephant National Park, South \nAfrica, and evaluated the effects of guides on day- and night-drives on the tourists' \nperceptions of faunal biodiversity. Self-guided tourists recorded seeing few mammals, \nreptiles and birds, these being largely limited to the large, charismatic and open-habitat \nspecies. Self-guided tourists who had seen elephants expressed satisfaction with their \nwildlife viewing, although some expressed a wish to have seen other vertebrates. Tourists \nwho participated in guided day-drives saw more species than self-guided tourists, while \nthose who participated in guided night-drives saw the greatest diversity of vertebrates. In \ngeneral, tourist interest in biodiversity was largely focused on a few vertebrates; while \ninvertebrates (with the exception of the flightless dung beetle) and plants were largely \nignored. We suggest that the quality of wildlife viewing may be significantly improved \nthrough the use of guides. Guiding offers an opportunity to expand the community involvement (through employing game-guides) and environmental education components of ecotourism. The findings of this study indicate that tourists focus on a few charismatic \nspecies and may hold misconceptions of the nature of biodiversity. We argue that the \nassumption of an umbrella role of a few charismatic species in protecting ecosystems and \ntheir constituent biodiversity is probably precarious. It is imperative that the public, and \npoliticians who make decisions regarding the conservation of biodiversity, are sensitized to \nthe value of biodiversity. Traditional self-guided wildlife viewing in conservation areas \ngenerally leads to the tourists having a lesser wildlife experience, which undervalues \nbiodiversity as an ecotourism resource.",

    "abstract": "Apex predators can have considerable impacts on meso-carnivore diets, through competition or facilitation. Facilitation occurs when smaller predators consume carrion created by larger predators, especially large-bodied prey species normally inaccessible to meso-carnivores. In contrast, apex predators can also negatively affect meso-carnivore consumption of important resources through competitive interactions. Thus, predicting meso-carnivore responses to trophic structure changes (i.e. apex predator extirpation or reintroduction) is often difficult. We investigated stable carbon and nitrogen isotope niche breadths of black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) in response to the reintroduction of an apex predator, the African lion (Panthera leo), to the Karoo National Park, South Africa. Jackal faecal isotopic niche widths were larger in post-lion than pre-lion samples, indicating a niche expansion to include pure C3- and C4-based food sources when lions were present. Most prey items of this nature in the study area are large-bodied ungulates. Our results agree with results of traditional scat analysis, which showed that prey species >92 kg were consumed more often after the lion reintroduction. Stable isotope data from carnivore faeces are effective for tracking responses of wildlife to changing ecological conditions, providing an alternative source of information about changes in community structure brought about by management interventions.",

    "abstract": "Habitat loss, persecution and population declines have resulted in the restriction of many large carnivores, including cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), to fenced reserves. These reserves are often small and the likelihood of interference competition between dominant and subordinate predators is increased, while the possibility of spatial avoidance is reduced. Given artificial space limitations, subordinate predators may reduce competitive interactions along niche axes other than habitat type such as time, coined a ‘management-induced niche shift’. We collected data on the activity patterns of male and female cheetahs using continuous follows and satellite GPS collars on two small, fenced reserves in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, one with lions (Panthera leo) and one without lions. There was a significant difference in the activity patterns of male and female cheetahs between the two reserves. In the presence of lions, nocturnal activity of cheetahs was greatly reduced, particularly for females. There was a corresponding increase in crepuscular activity for male cheetahs and diurnal activity for female cheetahs. In the context of other studies, our results suggest that space limitation affects cheetah response to lions and provides the first quazi-experimental evidence of a management-induced niche shift.",

    "abstract": "A diverse range of techniques have been used to survey mammals. Spoor counts and camera trapping are increasingly common survey tools used to detect the presence of species of interest in an area (occupancy). Given the significant time and financial investments in such surveys, and the management decisions based on their conclusions, it is imperative that confidence can be assigned to the results. It is therefore important to increase our understanding of the accuracy and constraints of each technique to allow managers and researchers to select the most suitable method for each situation. Here we compare results collected simultaneously using spoor and camera-trap surveys at a human—wildlife interface in northern Botswana. While our spoor survey and camera-trap surveys detected a similar number of mammal species (17 and 15, respectively), the species detected by each method differed. Of the 21 species detected overall, only about half (52.4%) were detected by both methods, and these co-detected species had significantly higher occupancy estimates than those species detected by only one method. Moreover, the direct comparison showed that some tracks were missed or misidentified by the spoor survey. Our results suggest that over short time frames, neither method is ideal for detecting species at low densities, and that researchers should consider combining multiple methods in such circumstances.",

    "abstract": "The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is an endangered species and South Africa has only one remaining viable population. Reintroduction of this species in South Africa is of high conservation priority and knowledge of the species' ecology is crucial for success. In this study, important information was gained regarding the reintroduction process although it ultimately failed. The current conservation plan for wild dogs incorporates such existing knowledge, but results from reintroductions (including failures) are needed to strengthen the strategy and its success. The main purpose of this study was to quantify home range area and habitat selection patterns of a wild dog pack unsuccessfully reintroduced into Mkhuze Game Reserve (MGR). A total of 847 radio-tracking fixes of the pack were collected. The home range area of the pack was estimated to be 383.9 km2 (100% minimum convex polygon method) or 377.9 km2 (95% fixed-kernel method), each value being larger than the area of the game reserve (360 km2). Significant monthly variations in home range areas of the pack were detected, with a maximum monthly home range area reached at ∼10 months after tracking began (19 months after the pack was reintroduced). Independent of season, the pack consistently selected Acacia nilotica low-closed woodland and consistently avoided riverine forest habitats. Small differences in home range areas of the pack were found between wet and dry seasons. The deaths of some wild dogs were the result of snares, and others may have been due to predation or hunting injuries. We present evidence that factors including game reserve area, availability of preferred habitat and climate may have contributed to the distribution patterns and ultimately the failure to maintain viable numbers during this wild dog reintroduction. The reintroduction of wild dogs to MGR was successful in that the introduced wild dogs bred, owing to the release of a pregnant female, but was considered unsuccessful since none of the dogs from the reintroduced pack survived or remained in MGR for more than two years. However, two wild dogs returned shortly after radio-tracking sessions ceased and were soon joined by another female from an adjacent game reserve.",

Objectives behind these reintroductions ranged from ecotourism, ecological restoration, to species conservation. We reassessed the reintroductions' objectives and updated their outcomes a decade after the initial assessment. Ecotourism and ecological restoration were the most common objectives for the reintroduction of top predators to these reserves. With one exception, these reintroductions were successful in meeting their specific objectives, as only African wild dogs have failed to re-establish in the province. Assessments for leopards and brown hyaenas were inconclusive due to a lack of monitoring data. Causes of objective- and species-specific failures in some reserves included founding same-sex populations, lack of breeding events and changes in reserve management objectives. Long-term monitoring is essential in managing and assessing the success of conservation actions, including reintroductions of threatened species. Our review demonstrates this by highlighting changed outcomes for populations and identifying new challenges that have arisen in the landscape. In the modern parlance of conservation marketing, the multi-species reintroductions that occurred within the Eastern Cape represent successful rewilding within the province.",

Many hobbyist UAVs have been applied to ecological studies, but proprietary software limits their widespread application with little quantification with regards to their accuracy and efficiency in the creation of maps through photogrammetry. Our study addressed these concerns by evaluating a combination of an entry-level UAV and open-source photogrammetry drone mapping software as a low-budget mapping solution for ecologists. Geometrically accurate orthophotograph maps were created from flights at altitudes below 70 m with and without differential global positioning system (d-GPS) ground control points. Object measurement errors were constrained below 30 mm for altitudes up to 70 m, and errors fell below 10 mm at 30 m altitudes with d-GPS points and below 20 mm without the use of d-GPS ground control points. Our analyses provide guidelines that parameterize the requirements for the mapping of smaller areas. Ecological surveys that do not require <50 mm accuracy can benefit from the methods described here, and many ecological studies that are presently using costly software and UAV platforms could save when adopting this approach.",

    "abstract": "The demand for vertebrates by traditional healers in South Africa suggests that the use of these animals in traditional medicinal or cultural practices has major conservation implications. This is supported by the fact that 31% of vertebrates used in these practices are listed in South African Red Data Books, indicating that their conservation status is already a matter of concern. Of those vertebrates used, mammals (65%) constitute the largest proportion, followed by birds (22%), reptiles (11%) and amphibians (1.3%). Some of these vertebrates (more especially those with critical conservation status) are significantly less available in the market. We suggest that, whereas this form of resource use has been largely ignored in the past, it may represent a threat to the conservation of biodiversity if poorly managed. It may also provide an opportunity to aid the conservation and sustainable use of indigenous vertebrates if properly managed.",

Thinning reduced inter-tree competition which resulted in significant increases in the vegetative growth of the remaining trees. As the intensity of thinning increases, the magnitude of these increases also increases. On a structural basis, vegetative growth within the trees was not uniform and the trees showed increases in canopy cover rather than increases in tree height. Although the vegetative growth per tree was higher in the low tree density plots, the larger number of trees in the high tree density plots ensured that the total seasonal leaf dry mass increase exceeded that of the low tree density plots. September to December are the critical months as far as vegetative growth is concerned. Tree thinning reduced the available browse at peak biomass, but trees from the low tree density plots displayed a better distribution of browse, having leaves in comparatively younger \nphenological states over an extended period. Marked differences in the nutritional composition and water content of C. mopanel/ig leaves existed in different phenological states.",

    "abstract": "The cyclic carbamate 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone (6-MBOA), which occurs naturally in fresh green vegetation, has been shown to initiate reproductive activity in a number of rodent species, mainly American. This phenomenon is of ecological interest, since reproductive triggers are important in ensuring that breeding effort coincides with an adequate food supply, to ensure good offspring survival. 6-MBOA in green vegetation offers an alternative reproductive trigger when other cues, such as changes in day length, are either absent or correlate poorly with vegetation flushes. This paper reports the results of attempts to demonstrate in the laboratory the presence of a reproductive response to dietary supplements of 6-MBOA or green vegetation in an Old World tropical rodent, the multimammate rat Mastomys coucha. A close relative of M. coucha, M. natalensis, has been observed to be capable of rapid colonization of habitats recovering from the effects of fire and drought, which suggests that these species might be likely to show a reproductive response to 6-MBOA or fresh vegetation. Male rodents showed no response, but both 6-MBOA and fresh green vegetation had a marked stimulatory effect on the ovaries of female animals.\nDaar is al bewys dat die sikliese karbamaat 6-metoksibensoksasolinoon (6-MBOA), wat natuurlik in vars groen plante voorkom, voortplantingsaktiwiteit in verskeie (hoofsaaklik Amerikaanse) knaagdiere stimuleer. Hierdie verskynsel is van ekologiese belang omdat voortplantingskatalisators met die beskikbaarheid van 'n voldoende voedselbron moet ooreenstem om maksimum oorlewing van kleintjies te verseker. 6-MBOA in groen plante bied 'n alternatiewe voortplantingskatalisator wanneer ander stimulante, bv. verandering in daglengte, of afwesig is of nie met die aanvang van die groei van nuwe groen plantvoedsel ooreenstem nie. Proewe is op die Ouwereldse tropiese knaagdier, Mastomys coucha, gedoen om voortplantingsreaksie op die byvoeging van 6-MBOA in die dieet, of op die voorsiening van groen plantvoedsel, te demonstreer. Daar is bevind dat M. natalensis, wat taksonomies nou verwant is aan M. coucha, habitatte wat van brande of droogte herstel, vinnig herkoloniseer, wat daarop dui dat die aanvang van voortplanting in hierdie twee spesies wel deur of 6-MBOA of groen plante gestimuleer word. Manlike M. coucha het glad nie op die proewe gereageer nie. Beide 6-MBOA en vars groen plante het egter 'n merkbare stimulerende effek op die eierstokke van wyfies gehad.",

    "abstract": "In most marginalized rural areas of developing countries, where employment opportunities and income channels are limited, illegal hunting of wildlife for subsistence and commercial purposes often prevails. Rapid human population growth and the rising demand for bushmeat, particularly in cities where bushmeat has become a popular delicacy, has increased illegal bushmeat harvesting. The extent and drivers of illegal hunting of two important habitat specialists and keystone species in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa, namely oribi (Ourebia ourebi) and serval (Leptailurus serval), are relatively poorly understood. Thus, we interviewed community members in the region (n = 271 interviews) and found that most respondents hunted illegally to acquire meat (82%), as bushmeat was perceived to taste better than domestic meat (46%). However, illegal bushmeat hunting in the region did not represent an important source of livelihood. Oribi were hunted for meat while serval were sought after for the purposes of traditional medicine and for the skin trade. The consideration of site-specific socio-economic drivers of illegal resource use is vital in ensuring effective conservation management for these two species. Our results also provide support for conservation initiatives addressing a wide range of wild animals affected by illegal hunting in this region.",

    "abstract": "In a number of African countries, the trophy hunting of large felids is an important revenue generator for landholders, governments and in some cases communities. The hunting of large felids is especially profitable but they are sensitive to harvest, as the killing of prime-aged, dominant males can lead to infanticide and lowered reproductive success. In an attempt to limit the negative impacts of trophy hunting on large felids, the scientific community has proposed a number of interventions, including age restrictions on the animals that may be hunted. Such interventions are theoretically complementary to trophy hunting, as hunters typically seek large trophies, and older animals are normally larger than younger ones in large felids. If trophy size results in an increase in trophy price, then interventions that improve average trophy size could confer elevated earnings. This is particularly true if such interventions increased the number of failed hunts such that the same tag can be sold more than once. However, if trophy size is not one of the most important factors determining the desirability of a hunt (which we judge by the price paid for a trophy hunt package), it may be more difficult to implement such schemes. It is therefore important to evaluate potential determinants of trophy hunt package price; and we examine that here for leopards (Panthera pardus) in Africa, at both the country and outfitter level. We show that Tanzania and Botswana have the most expensive package prices while South Africa has the cheapest packages. At the country level, we found no statistical relationships between package price and leopard trophy size (either through advertised website or Safari Club International (SCI) leopard trophy size), country GDP, relative hunt success, or quota size. Contrastingly, the number of charismatic species offered within a package and an index of outfitter reputation (as measured by total SCI trophy records) were positively associated with package price. Interestingly, SCI leopard trophy size was inversely correlated with package price. Our results suggest that hunters do not value leopard trophy size above other factors, which could hinder the implementation of more sustainable, age-based leopard hunting regulations.",

Central to the success of the managed metapopulation is the artificial formation of packs by bonding groups of unrelated male and female wild dogs prior to release. Here, we provide data from both a failed and a successful bonding attempt in the De Beers Venetia Limpopo Nature Reserve and identify two variables which may be used to determine the probability of a successful artificial bonding attempt: distance to partitioning fence and frequency of ‘hoo-calls’. Both variables decreased significantly with time for the successful bonding attempt but not for the unsuccessful one. Based on our observations we suggest that behavioural observations can provide important cues to predict the success of bonding attempts, and that such cues may be used to terminate bonding attempts that are likely to fail, and hence potentially avoid catastrophic outcomes such as killed or injured animals.",

Simultaneously, rural communities and commercial farmlands at the interface of human development and natural habitat face severe threats to their livelihoods and agricultural security, often resulting in the vast eradication of real or perceived damage-causing animals (DCAs). The knowledge of local people was relied on to elucidate the dynamic and interwoven social, economic and ecological factors giving rise to the largely undocumented conflict between landowners and wildlife adjacent to the Boland Mountain Complex, South Africa. Subsequently, the spatial location of observed and expected zones of species-specific risk on a regional level was anticipated and mapped using a maximum entropy algorithm. The highest level of tolerance by farmers was shown for primates and ungulates, while tolerance for carnivores, avifauna and invasive or feral species were comparatively lower. The results presented in this manuscript will enable the prioritization of locations and species to create improved mitigation and management plans. It will furthermore provide for more accurate allocation of conservation resources to minimize conflicts, optimize agricultural yield, reduce wildlife off-take, and ultimately ameliorate human–wildlife conflict.",

However, with the emergence of zoonotic parasites, it is important to consider the wildlife reservoir and the spectrum of their zoonotic parasites. Human activities have increased contact with game, thus humans serve either as intermediate, reservoir or accidental host in the sylvatic cycle. The epidemiological information of these zoonotic wildlife parasites are scanty due to poor surveillance strategies in Africa, therefore prevalence studies are necessary to develop control measures and to conduct consequence assessments in cases of outbreaks. This review emphasizes the role that wildlife plays in spreading zoonotic parasites to other animals and humans and the consequences in Africa. It summarizes the present knowledge about the prevalence and spectrum of zoonotic parasites of wildlife and the human population at risk in Africa. It also gives insight into the dynamics of zoonotic parasites of wildlife. It will also increase our risk perception of zoonotic diseases and help to formulate effective control measures in Africa.",

The species was transferred from CITES Appendix I to Appendix II in 2004, although it is recognized as peripherally endangered in Namibia due to diminishing habitat availability primarily from human encroachment. In 2013, a species management plan was approved in Namibia to assess the management of the Namibian Nile crocodile populations. During 2012, an aerial survey was conducted to provide an estimate of Nile crocodile population numbers. A recently developed N-mixture model for estimation of abundance and spatial variation was used. Detection probability correlated to animal size and environmental covariates. Our data also suggest that small crocodiles are easier to detect during the spring. The abundance for different size classes was influenced by river complexity (vegetation, depth, channels) and the distribution of human settlements. An estimated 806 individuals were counted along the 352 km Namibian portion of the Kunene River system with a conservative estimate of 562 crocodiles regardless of size. The parameter estimates generated by the analysis suggested that the class-structured model can produce reliable estimates of total abundance and of local abundance for this section in the Kunene River system.",

Eight 20-min walk-through counts were done per season (excluding summer) in each habitat. Bird species richness and abundance were higher in the indigenous habitat than in any of the pine habitats during each season. The three-year-old pine habitat had higher numbers of species and individuals than the two mature pine habitats. Birds were recorded more infrequently in the pine habitats compared with the indigenous habitat. The greatest proportion of species recorded in the mature pine habitats were species of the riparian habitat assemblage. Fynbos species and widespread species predominated in the three-year-old pine habitat.\nDie voelgroepe van drie klein denne-habitatte van verskillende ouderdomme en 'n inheemse beboste habitat is ondersoek in die omgewing van Stellenbosch, Suid Afrika.

Only at the coastal site did dietary patterns of yellow mongooses reflect fluctuations in prey availability. The presence, in small quantities, of other prey types in scats at both study sites indicates opportunistic feeding behaviour by this mongoose.\nDie diete van die geelmeerkat Cynictis penicillata in die Weskus Strand veld en Karoo ekosisteme word vergelyk deur middel van misanalise.

Barley and wheat farmers on the Agulhas Plain regard the Egyptian goose, Alopochen aegyptiacus, as a serious agricultural pest. By answering key questions about this species’ biology, such as its population increase, spatial and temporal abundance, and financial impact on barley and wheat, recommendations are proposed for the management of the species so as to minimize damage to croplands.",

The LC50 values attained during this study, can be used as an indication of the levels at which copper becomes lethal to O. mossambicus and must only be seen as the limits within which the concentration of copper can be regarded as lethal for this species in the Olifants River. Acute toxicity tests were performed to determine the lethal copper concentrations for juvenile Oreochromis mossambicus at representative mean summer (29°C) and winter temperatures (19°C) of the Olifants River, Kruger National Park, Northern Province, South Africa. Fish were exposed to various copper concentrations (0.0, 1.0, 1.7, 1.8,2.0,2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 mg / l) for 96 h in experimental flow-through systems at pH levels which ranged between 7.4 and 8.1, and mortalities were monitored. Dosage-survival curves of percentage survival versus actual copper concentrations were plotted after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and thereafter the LC50 or median lethal concentration (the concentration of the test material that will kill or immobilize 50% of the test organisms over a predetermined length of time, usually 24 to 96 h) values were calculated for both summer and winter temperatures. Time survival curves of percentage survival versus time were also plotted, after which the LT50 or median survival time (the time required for half the fish to die at a specific toxicant concentration) values were calculated for the two temperatures. Toxicity curves were constructed using both the LC50 and LT50 values to determine the incipient LC50 values (ILC50 - the lethal concentration for 50% of the test organism in a long-term exposure or lethal threshold concentration). The LC50 values (lethal copper concentration) of 2.61 mg / l and 2.78 mg / l as well as the ILC50 values (lethal threshold concentration) of 2.95 mg / l and 3.32 mg / l for copper at 29 ± 1°C and 19 ± 1°C respectively, are considerably higher than the copper concentrations occurring in the water of the Olifants River, during summer (0.055 ± 0.016 mg / l) and winter (0.085 ± 0.032 mg / l).

The ratio is shown to vary depending on recruitment and survival rates, but more dramatically according to the quantity, age and sex of seals removed, and the magnitude of disturbance caused by sealing. Ratios of over 5 : 1 would seem appropriate for the South African fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus based on the current data for the population and the history of sealing and its associated disturbance, and this is larger than ratios previously documented for this species. If a seal population is to be reduced by removing cows, it is important to note that pup numbers will reflect a much lower growth rate than that of the population as a whole.\n'n Nabootsingsmodel is gebruik om veranderings in die verhouding tussen totale bevolking en die getal jong robbe, by verskillende lewensgeskiedenis-parameters en robvangsprogramme, te ondersoek. Daar word bewys dat die verhouding mag verander, afhangende van die werwings- en oorlewingstempo, maar meer opvallend van die getal, ouderdom, en geslag van robbe wat deur mense verwyder word, asook die versteuring wat deur robvangste veroorsaak word. Gebaseer op die huidige data vir die bevolking asook die geskiedenis van, en gepaardgaande versteurings deur robvangste van die Suid Afrikaanse pelsrob Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, blyk 'n verhouding van meer as 5 : 1 van pas te wees, wat hoer is as enige vorige gedokumenteerde verhouding. As 'n robbevolking deur uitdunning van koeie verminder sou word, is dit belangrik om te besef dat die getal jong robbe 'n heelwat laer groeikoers vir die hele bevolking sal aandui.",

A geographic information system (GIS) was used to store, generate and retrieve model variables. Variables used as input to the models were mean, minimum and maximum slope, mean, minimum and maximum elevation, aspect, vegetation community, distance to drinking water, and terrain ruggedness as the number of contour lines crossing the grid. The models were constructed by inductive inference, using an artificial intelligence technique known as iterative dichotomizing. The technique used a complex sequence of dichotomous rules, similar to decision trees, to predict the presence or absence of mountain reedbuck at a site. The rules were converted to expert systems. The expert systems were validated by testing their ability to classify correctly independent data from the same study area. The classification success of the models ranged between 63 and 66%. In both instances this was significantly greater than 50%. The advantages and disadvantages of models created by inductive inference from GIS-based data are discussed. Iterative dichotomizing is a promising technique to develop models from existing data which are stored in information systems, provided that the appropriate data are available. Such data will vary according to the animal being studied and the scale of study.\nModelle wat op reels gebaseer is, is ontwikkel om die teenwoordigheid of afwesigheid van rooiribbokke Redunca fulvorufula in 'n natuurreservaat in dorre dwergstruikveld in die Karoo te bepaal. 'n Geografiese Inligtingstelsel (GIS) is gebruik om data te stoor, te skep en te onttrek. Veranderlikes wat as inset tot die model gebruik is, was gemiddelde, minimum en maksimum helling, gemiddelde, minimum en maksimum elevasie, aspek, plantgemeenskap, afstand vanaf water en terreingebrokenheid. Die modelle is deur induktiewe afleiding saamgestel en het gebruik gemaak van 'n kunsmatige intelligensietegniek bekend as 'opeenvolgende tweesplitsing'. Die modelle het 'n ingewikkelde stel reels, soortgelyk aan besluitnemingsbome, gebruik om die teenwoordigheid of afwesigheid van rooiribbokke by 'n lokalitiet te voorspel. Die reels is omskep in kundigheidsisteme. Die kundigheidsisteme is getoets volgens hul vermoens om onafhanklike data van dieselfde studiegebied te klassifiseer. Die klassifikasiesukses van die modelie het gewissel van 63 tot 66%. In beide gevalle was dit betekenisvol groter as 50%. Die voordele van GIS was dat data toeganklik was en dat dit as 'n sentrale stelsel vir die stoor van data gedien het. Die resultate van opeenvolgende tweesplitsing was maklik om te interpreteer en toe te pas. Dit is 'n belowende tegniek om modelie te ontwikkel van bestaande data wat in inligtingstelselsgestoor word, mits die toepaslike data beskikbaar is.",

    "abstract": "Anglers' catches off St Croix Island were examined on a monthly basis, for the period December 1975 to February 1978, to establish the catch composition and catch per unit effort. A total of 343 anglers caught 2,7 metric tons bony fish and 0,7 metric tons cartilaginous fish in 95697 man-hours, over the entire sampling period. Trends in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) were examined and expressed in three ways: number of fish caught per man-hour; mass of fish caught per man-hour and mass of P.saltatrix and C. nufar, respectively, per man-hour. The fish (bony and cartilaginous) appear to be most abundant in the summer months and least abundant in mid-winter (July). However, the seasonal appearance of P. saltatrix and presence of C. nufar in the catches, increase the CPUE greatly. The cartilaginous component has little or no significance in terms of numbers caught per man-hour, but due to the larger mass of individual cartilaginous fish, the CPUE of certain months was subsequently higher. A comprehensive list of all fish species caught and the frequency occurrence of each species in the catches is also given.",

The Dyer Island region abounds in \nthese predators, as well as seabirds, including the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), \nCape cormorant (<i.Phalacrocorax capensis), bank cormorant (P. neglectus), white-breasted \ncormorant (P. carbo), and crowned cormorant (P. coronatus). Between August 1999 and \nFebruary 2001, predatory interactions among these taxa were quantified and qualified by \nthe routine collection and inspection of seabird carcasses and injured birds, as well as \nopportunistic observations of live attacks. White sharks are infrequent predators of seabirds \nat Dyer Island, perhaps due to an abundance of Cape fur seals (a preferred prey), antipredator \nbehaviour by penguins, and seabirds not being a preferred prey type.Cape fur seals \nwere more conspicuous seabird predators, each year attacking adult penguins (1.99-2.52%), \nwhite-breasted cormorants (5.21-5.72%), and crowned cormorants (3.13%), as well as a \nsingle bank cormorant. Cape fur seals killed an estimated 0.83-1.09% of the fledgling Cape \ncormorants. Attacks on penguins at the island are crepuscular as birds depart to and return \nfrom foraging grounds. Fledgling Cape cormorants are frequently attacked when alighting \non water following disturbance and failed flight attempts, or for bathing.Human disturbance, \nwhich may force birds to take to the water, may cause inter-annual differences in the \npredation impact on this taxon.",

Many of these birds were recaptured repeatedly and re-equipped with new radio packages. The behaviour and physical condition of both radio equipped and unmarked black ducks were recorded while radio-tracking and observing birds during daylight in all months of the year. Individual birds were observed during all phases (courting, nesting, moulting, etc.) of their annual cycles. The birds' physical condition, in respect to body mass, was hardly if at all affected, and then probably only very temporarily, in adjusting to the radio-package. Preening sessions tended to be longer in instrumented birds, especially during the first few weeks after radios were fitted. The birds' selection and use of habitat apparently were not affected. Instrumented individuals were successful in feeding, obtaining and holding mates, defending territories, breeding, moulting and escaping predators.",

Observations were made of the effects on the birds of the incidence and absence of fire. Case histories of how francolin populations changed in relation to fire-regimes on four areas were documented. The absence of fire was more critical to the birds at low than at high elevations. Redwings were more tolerant of the absence of fire than greywing. Greywing declined in numbers from winter to spring whether or not fires were applied. Numbers were highest in autumn, following the breeding season. Although the evidence was not as clear-cut as for greywing francolins, redwing probably underwent similar fluctuations in numbers.",

A total of 309 spraints representing two seasons (summer 2013/2014 and winter 2014) were collected and subsequently analysed. The percentage occurrence and percentage dry mass of numerous prey categories were compared between sites and seasons. Variation in the importance of prey items was found between sites, whilst no variation was found between seasons within the same site. Crab was the most important prey item in the southernmost study area (Tsitsikamma National Park) and at the northernmost study site (KwaZulu-Natal Coast), whilst lobster was the most important prey item in the central area (Mkambati Nature Reserve). Fish was the second most important prey item at all three sites. Our results suggest that otters are opportunistic feeders that are likely able to adapt to potential prey species and abundance changes associated with current and future anthropogenically driven changes. Furthermore, long-term, site-specific stability in diet suggests that monitoring the diet of otters could provide some useful information on the status of shoreline communities.",

Large volumes of movement data derived from GPS telemetry devices offer the opportunity to analyse animal behaviour on a very fine scale. GPS and satellite collars were fitted to female brown hyaenas (Parahyaenabrunnea) as part of a long-term monitoring study in southwestern Namibia. The date of parturition was determined by comparing changes in movement data and successful GPS positioning attempts. Distances moved on the day of parturition dropped to zero and frequent, unsuccessful GPS positioning attempts on the same day indicated locations in underground dens. Daily distances moved pre-partum, during parturition and post-partum differed significantly and reflected behavioural changes that can be monitored and used to draw inferences about the reproductive state of female brown hyaenas. The main predictors for den occupancy were the age of cubs, distance to closest food source and individual den. Mean occupancy over the entire denning period was 23 days, indicating that brown hyaenas readily move between dens, but individual breeding females showed den site fidelity. Therefore, GPS telemetry is a useful tool to accurately determine parturition in brown hyaenas to draw inferences about den occupancy.",

Mediating conflict is a conservation priority both due to its socio-economic impacts and due to consequences that negative perceptions of wildlife have for conservation outcomes. We document locally novel emergent conflict following reintroductions of large carnivores to fenced reserves in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Interviews with managers of 13 reserves (reintroduction sites) and adjacent properties show that reintroduced carnivores escaped from eight reserves (61.5%) and were recorded on 25 neighbouring properties (36.7%). Since large carnivore reintroductions to the Eastern Cape Province began in 1996, 75 associated conflict events were reported to the authors. This conflict was not evenly distributed, spatially or economically. Effective, evidence-based mitigation strategies are needed to ensure the continued success of conservation actions. Neighbours and policymakers should be primed for such lifted baselines where predator numbers and/or densities reflect what was historically observed. These conflicts should be anticipated and included in the early planning phases of reintroduction adaptive management processes. Conflict mitigation strategies for reintroductions should include lifting baselines to manage perceptions around recovering wildlife populations or face the prospects of re-extirpation associated with conflict-motivated retaliation.",

In this study we compare medium-to-large mammal diversity on rangeland, game farms and natural land within the Little Karoo, South Africa. Mammal diversity was assessed using camera traps set up at 141 sites, and compared across the three land-use types. There were no significant differences in mammal diversity across land-use types, although rangelands typically supported fewer species. Game farms had similar species richness to natural areas, suggesting that the introduction of large ungulate species and the erection of game-proof fencing has had little impact on mammal diversity to date. Importantly, our results suggest that land used for low-intensity grazing by cattle (Bos taurus) can support similar mammalian species richness to natural areas, which indicates a high level of compatibility between current economic activities and biodiversity conservation in this area. Although specific to the Little Karoo, our findings can inform management and conservation decision-making on a broader scale, as they support evidence of the biodiversity value of economically active land.",

Residents were questioned as to their attitudes to whale watching development and existing information facilities and as to the time and money spent whale watching. Visitors were questioned as to their origin, reasons for their visit to Hermanus, expenditure on their visit and their attitudes to information facilities and development. The total number of whale-watching visitors to Hermanus over the entire season could not be determined as no direct revenue is collected from this activity. Furthermore, direct counts were influenced by tourist turnover and multi-site watching within Hermanus. Consequently, visitor numbers were estimated from the observations made during surveys. The expenditure of whale-watch visitors over the 1995 season is estimated at about R5 million in indirect expenses. Residents were generally in agreement with the development of shore-based whale watching as a tourism activity, but against the development of boat-based whale watching.",

Appropriate management strategies, under intensive systems, may be to the advantage of roan populations. The exponential rate of increase of roan populations under various degrees of intensive management was investigated. A one-way analysis of variance was used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the rate of increase between roan populations. The roan population on the Nylsvlei Nature Reserve had a negative rate of increase. The high exponential rate of increase (0.2574) of the small Rooipoort population differed significantly (p < 0.05) from all other populations. This population grazed on planted pastures and was fed during the dry season with at least 0.5 kg of supplementary food per day (mixture of lucerne, antelope cubes and lick). It also had the highest sex ratio. Under intensive management. animals may be stocked at a density of up to 20 animals / km2. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient showed that the rate of increase was correlated with the amount of supplementary feeding. For the populations investigated no correlation was found with % females, % calving rate, population size and density.",

    "abstract": "The effects of three seasons of hunting on characteristics of a feral cat population on sub-Antarctic Marion Island are evaluated. Hunting pressure fell mainly on adults, resulting in the population becoming progressively younger. Adult year-class age structures and sex ratios did not change, indicating that no adult group was particularly vulnerable to hunting. Proportions of females breeding and number of litters per female per year decreased, resulting in a decrease in mean fecundity. Lower fecundity is thought to be a consequence of lower encounter rates between males and females at lowered densities. Using several methods, estimates of population size varied greatly. The only real indication of the decrease in density was the drastic increase in the number of hours hunted at night per cat seen : from 1,3 h per cat at the start of the first season to 8,3 h by the end of the third season.\nDie uitwerking van drie jagseisoene op die eienskappe van 'n wilde huiskatbevolking op sub-Antarktiese Marioneiland word ge-evalueer. Die jag het druk hoofsaaklik op volwassenes uitgeoefen, wat daartoe gelei het dat die bevolking toenemend jonger geword het. Volwassenes se jaarklas-ouderdomstrukture en geslagsverhoudings het nie verander nie, wat aangedui het dat geen volwasse groep besonder kwesbaar vir jag was nie. Verhoudings van telende wyfies en aantal werpsels per wyfie per jaar het afgeneem, wat tot 'n afname in gemiddelde fekunditeit gelei het. Laer fekunditeit word beskou as 'n gevolg van die laer kontaktempo tussen mannetjies en wyfies by laer digthede. Die gebruik van verskeie metodes om bevolkingsgrootte te bepaal het tot groot variasie in bevolkingsskattings gelei. Die enigste werklike aanduiding van die afname in digtheid was die drastiese toename in die aantal ure gejag in die nag per kat gesien : vanaf 1,3 h per kat by aanvang van die eerste seisoen tot 8,3 h teen die einde van die derde seisoen.",

This study investigated, by means of a questionnaire survey, the apparent collapse of guineafowl populations in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and Drakensberg regions, and the potential agricultural causes thereof. The number of pesticides used, their toxicity levels, and the proportion of land under cultivation can be used to discriminate significantly between extinct and declining versus stable and increasing guineafowl populations, being higher in the former populations. These results suggest that efficient, intensive farming practices have not only compressed the period in the farming year over which food is available to the guineafowl, but also reduced the suitability of farmlands as wildlife habitat. Remedies are suggested to resuscitate declining populations and optimize their long-term preservation for potential sustainable utilization. Recommended management actions include the judicious use of pesticides and the creation of suitable habitat at the landscape scale.",

    "abstract": "Selection and use of microhabitats by the bush Karoo rat Otomys unisulcatus at Tsolwane Game Park, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were investigated. The herbaceous vegetation did not significantly influence the microdistribution of O. unisulcatus on the study site, but the floristic composition and structure of the woody vegetation were critical determinants of habitat choice. O. unisulcatus was significantly associated with shrubby Lycium austrinum and non-dwarf L. horridum, which apparently provide cover from raptors and a reliable source of food. Arboreal foraging was typical of O. unisulcatus, and the fruits of Lycium spp. were included in the diet. In contrast to the situation at Postberg Nature Reserve on the Cape West coast (Vermeulen & Nel 1988), O. unisulcatus at Tsolwane was strictly diurnal, nest chambers were located underground, and lodge density was markedly lower. These differences are interpreted as reflecting local adaptive responses to climatic disparities between the two localities.\nMikrohabitat-seleksie en -benutting deur die boskaroorot Otomys unisulcatus is op Tsolwane Wildpark, Oostelike Kaapprovinsie, Suid Afrika, ondersoek. Die kruidagtige plantegroei het nie in die studiegebied 'n betekenisvolle effek op die mikroverspreiding van O. unisulcatus gehad nie, maar die floristiese samestelling en struktuur van die bosagtige plantegroei was krities by habitat-keuse. O. unisulcatus was betekenisvol geassosieer met struikagtige Lycium austrinum en nie-dwergagtige L. horridum, wat blykbaar beskutting teen roofvoels en 'n betroubare voedselbron bied. Om kos te soek in bome was tipies van O. unisulcatus, en die vrugte van Lycium spp. het deel gevorm van die dieet. In teenstelling met die situasie by Postberg Natuurreservaat aan die Kaapse Weskus (Vermeulen & Nel 1988), was O. unisulcatus op Tsolwane streng daglewend, neskamers was ondergronds gelee, en nes-digtheid was merkbaar laer.

    "abstract": "This ongoing study relates human land use management to movements by large mammals, particularly the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Movements are related to two landscape-scale variables : the risk of predation and the availability of water. As a contribution to the emerging field of landscape ecology, study objectives are to elucidate (1) how a large herbivore responds to certain management schemes with changes in their distribution across the landscape, and (2) the spatial requirements of buffalo for water, food, and predator levels, predators including humans as well as lions (Panthera leo). In the border region of western Zimbabwe and eastern Botswana, five very different land use types are available to mobile mammals, in a large unfenced region managed consistently from 1975-1995 for consumptive and non-consumptive utilization of natural resources. Buffalo breeding herds are spoored to show their movements and utilization of resources at three scales, through a six month dry season. Frequency of predation attempts and buffalo herd distributions are obtained from spoor, interviews with residents, driven transects, and mortality records from both countries' Departments of Wildlife and National Parks. Water availability is mapped monthly from the air. Herd selection of areas with different water and risk levels indicate their preferred land management regimes. This paper represents the first year's results at the large scale; the distributions of buffalo and permanent water correlating closely. The land use types differ in water distribution and predation pressure. Although lion predation occurred at similar high rates throughout the region, hunting pressure varied from none to several hunters searching daily for buffalo through the dry season. The behaviour of these generalist herbivores, capable of moving large distances, supports hypotheses that animals move further between food and water as the dry season progresses, and as risk levels differ. Buffalo move and forage differently in Safari Areas (managed for low-impact safari hunting, high-density provisioned water, and high habitat diversity) than in National Parks (some of which pump water through the dry season). The maximum distance from water a breeding herd was found in 1995 was 8.7 km. This, and herds' greater use of safari areas over similarly watered National Parks lands indicates that the safari areas may provide greater benefits than costs to mobile mammals such as buffalo.",

The number of black-backed jackals fluctuated on a seasonal basis : It increased throughout winter and reached a nadir in summer. The Mokolodi jackals exhibited a bigeminous activity pattern (crepuscular and nocturnal periods). Periods of activity occurred between 17h00 and 22h00, and also from 05h00 to 08h00, with peaks around 18h00 and 06h00. Activity was more pronounced for winter (27.2%), followed by spring (21.7%) and autumn (20.8%). The two summers (1995-96 and 1996-97) revealed similar proportions of overall jackal activity. Hunting / foraging activity (35.4%, n = 462) predominated over locomotor activity (23.5%, n = 307), human avoidance (flight) behaviour (23.2%, n =290), social interactions (13.9%, n = 182), and the resting (5.0%, n = 65) activity types. However, 'Interactions' and 'Flight' activity types differed significantly with season, whilst there were no significant seasonal changes in the occurrence of other activity types. In general, the frequency of occurrence of each activity type varied across time-periods. Jackal vocalisation was most frequent during winter (34.3%, n = 91), followed by autumn (24.2%, n = 64), whereas the frequency of calling during spring and the two summer periods were in similar proportions (15.8%, 12.1%, and 13.6% respectively). These findings are discussed in relation to the behavioural ecology of black-backed jackals in MNR.",

We \ndocument important aspects of the population dynamics of elephants in these reserves \nusing data collected in a survey conducted in 2001. The mean population size was 45 \nelephants, with an average density of 0.25 elephants/km 2 . Populations have a female bias \nwith 0.79 males to females. Populations have 19% adult males, and 31% adult females. On \naverage, almost 50% of the population comprises adult and subadult females, indicating an \nimmanent potential for large population growth. Births were not significantly different from a \n1:1 sex ratio. When two extreme populations were removed, mean mortality rate was 0.4% \nper annum. Population growth rates averaged 8.3%, but five reserves had growth rates above \n13%, and the highest annual growth rate was 16.5% per annum. Twenty-seven populations \nalready have densities above 0.2 elephants/km 2 , and eight reserves have densities above 0.4 \nelephants/km 2 . Assuming a 12% per annum growth (feasible given the data presented), over \nhalf the reserves will have densities above 0.33 elephants/kmlsupg2l/supg within five years. These \nresults indicate that the translocation of elephants has been successful, with most populations \nreproducing at a rate far exceeding expectations. This has serious implications for \nowners and managers, as some form of population control (contraception, removals, culling \netc.) needs to be urgently planned for implementation as soon as possible in most, and \nprobably all small reserves.",

    "abstract": "Division of labour, in terms of providing for offspring, in obligate cooperatively breeding mammalian species is poorly understood. To understand offspring provisioning in a cooperatively breeding canid, we analysed a long-term dataset comprising 22 African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, denning events (nine packs over nine consecutive years). We investigated the effects of sex, age class, social status, and pack size on the likelihood and frequency of regurgitating food to pups at the den. We found that the interaction of social status and pack size affected the likelihood of regurgitation. Specifically, when in a large (≤15) pack, dominant individuals were less likely to regurgitate than subordinate individuals. However, in smaller (≤ 15) packs, dominant individuals were more likely to regurgitate than subordinate individuals. We also found that the interaction of age and pack size affected the frequency of regurgitation. Specifically, in large packs, yearlings regurgitated more frequently per observation period than adults. Contrastingly, in smaller packs, adults regurgitated more frequently. Sex did not affect pup provisioning. We suggest that these contrasting patterns of helping are best explained by a strong selection pressure for individual behaviour that results in larger pack sizes in this species. When in larger packs, costs are shared as the division of labour spreads amongst individuals. In smaller packs, a division of labour requires individuals that already experience costs (such as reproduction) to be further burdened by provisioning. Overall, our results support that the need for more helpers to care for offspring contributes to the evolutionary consequence of an inverse density dependence.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying landscape characteristics that wildlife select is essential for conservation and management action. Models that map wildlife resource selection tend to be informed by telemetry technology which is costly to acquire/maintain and potentially risky to deploy. Therefore, there is value in pursuing alternative data collection protocols, such as citizen scientist approaches to ascertain whether they can reveal results comparable to those derived from telemetry studies. The conservation of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) presents an interesting case study to examine this topic. The species is rare and wideranging, hence data collection is both challenging and costly. They are, however, a groupliving species with unique and conspicuous coat markings, making them potentially well-suited to citizen science data collection strategies. Here, we fitted resource selection functions (RSFs) built from Global Position System (GPS) telemetry data, and from citizen scientist data, collected in and around Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We assessed comparability of these RSFs by evaluating the relative importance of parameters, parameter coefficients (direction and magnitude of effect), and the spatial predictions of relative probability of use by African wild dogs. The most important predictors in both models were proportion of woodland and bushland, the number of habitat types, and distance to waterhole. Furthermore, spatial predictions from both models displayed a high degree of overlap (r = 0.74), indicating similarities in selected and avoided habitat patches. Our analysis demonstrates that sufficient citizen science data can be a valuable alternative to telemetry data for African wild dogs. We thus encourage the collection and use of citizen science data for similar analyses, particularly when funding is limited. Our work also highlights areas in and around Hwange National Park with the highest probability of being used by African wild dogs, which is where conservation efforts should be intensified.",

Estimates of the number of dolphins and groups, as well as an estimate of the probability of seeing a group in the survey area, were obtained using mark-recapture methods and data from sets of successive, but independent, aerial transects. There were large variations in the numbers of bottlenose dolphins and groups counted between May and September and also between successive days. Using data on mean dolphin swimming speeds to identify 'marked' groups, the numbers of dolphins and groups in the area were estimated (with nominal 95% confidence limits) at 520 (160; 970) and 10 (5; 17), respectively. The probability of seeing a group was estimated at 0,31 (0,15; 0,46), implying that most groups were not seen. Estimates of group abundance were imprecise as a result of the small sample size obtained and the uncertainty in identifying 'marked' groups. The implications of these results for previous population estimates of bottlenose dolphins in Natal and the impact of continued incidental captures of these dolphins are discussed.\nAgt-en-twintig lugtransekte is langs 'n gedeelte van die Natalse noordkus in vyf dae gedurende Mei (twee dae, 12 transekte) en September (drie dae, 16 transekte) 1989 gevlieg.

Deur data te gebruik van die gemiddelde swemspoed van dolfyne om 'n 'gemerkte' groep te identifiseer, is die aantal dolfyne en groepe in die gebied geskat (met nominale 95% betroubaarheidsgrense) op 520 (160; 970) en 10 (5; 17) onderskeidelik. Die waarskynlikheid van die waarneming van 'n groep is geskat op 0,31 (0,15; 0,46), wat daarop dui dat die meeste groepe nie gesien is nie. Skatting van groepgetalle was nie presies nie vanwee die klein monstergrootte en onsekerheid by die identifisering van 'gemerkte' groepe. Die implikasie van die resultate vir vorige bevolkingskattings van stompneusdolfyne in Natal, en die invloed van voortgesette toevallige vangste van die dolfyne, word bespreek.",

Buffalo numbers for Mozambique are incomplete, but a decline is estimated at 79% in the buffalo population in the Marromeu Complex. The total number of buffalo in the six largest free-ranging populations in southern Africa, excluding Mozambique, has decreased by more than 50% between 1991 and 1996. The main factor influencing buffalo numbers and distribution in the sub-region is the development of the cattle industry, followed by drought and disease. Only South Africa and Zimbabwe actively produce surplus buffalo for translocation or sale. However, the cumulative loss of genetic diversity in these small, isolated populations may have potentially serious consequences.",

    "abstract": "The remains of 1542 prey individuals were collected at 35 martial eagle Polemaetus bellicosus nests and feeding perches to analyse, by number, the diet of the species in the Cape Province. Overall, hares are the dominant prey taxon (50% of the total), followed by striped polecat, genet, ground squirrel, and mongooses (14%). Juvenile domestic small-stock comprises 5%, of which a portion is likely to be carrion. The eagles, which tend to select prey in the 1-5 kg mass range, are opportunistic predators which take a wide spectrum of prey but which also exploit local abundances of suitable types. The effect of habitat variation on the diet, across an environmental gradient, was investigated by creating three groups of nests according to key environmental criteria pertinent to the four biomes in which they are located. The three groups, NW and SE Nama-Karoo (arid zone) and Grassland (moist zone), were compared according to relative proportions of prey taxa, and indices of general diversity and species richness. From the Nama-Karoo groups to the Grassland group the proportion formed by hares decreases from 63% to 13%, and that of birds increases from 7% to 32%. There is a statistically significant increase in prey diversity from each of the Nama-Karoo groups to the Grassland group, and in species richness from the SE Nama-Karoo group to the Grassland group. These findings are discussed in relation to differences in rainfall, topography, primary production, and vegetation cover and height between the Nama-Karoo and Grassland or Savanna Biomes.",

A population assessment in 2010 observed a skew in the sex structure with a greater proportion of males (56%) which raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the greater KTP lion population. A key indicator of how a population responds to changes in population structure is population size. We conducted an intensive lion census between 2013 and 2015 in the southwestern KTP (14 250 km2) driving 49 784 km over 317 sampling days, which resulted in 1162 lion sightings. Registering the population through individual identification (n = 261) provided a benchmark against which other techniques could be measured and for a non-invasive marking technique. Open-population mark-recapture provided the most precise estimate of population size (n = 246; 95%CI: 237–256). Track indices (n = 242; 95%CI: 176–307) provided a similar best estimate, but were imprecise. Minimum-known-alive calculations (n = 145) provided a gross underestimate. All the methods used in this study indicate a larger lion population size than previous estimates.",

Five muscles from male warthogs had higher shear force values (i.e. were less tender) compared to females. Allmuscles had a total protein content >20% and total lipid content ≤2.2%. The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids of the Longissimus lumborum muscle was <0.45.

Habitat change, overharvesting and retaliatory killing may threaten the persistence of some populations. Climate may cause further disturbance that accentuate negative effects. Droughts weaken the ability of prey to avoid predators resulting in larger carnivore populations. We thus expected populations of African lions and spotted hyaenas to increase during a drought in Kruger National Park (Kruger). Prey that is easier to hunt during droughts may also influence age and sex structures through impacts on survival and fecundity schedules. We tested these predictions by collating information from previous studies and conducting a field call-up survey in Kruger. A severe drought in Kruger during the summer of 2015/2016 allowed pre- and post-drought comparisons. Before the drought, lion and spotted hyaena numbers increased in response to increasing prey biomass. During the drought, lions maintained their numbers, while spotted hyaena numbers increased further. There were substantially more subadult male lions after than before the drought. The abundant subadult males may induce higher incidences of human–carnivore conflict through more dispersing males in future. Our analyses highlighted immediate and lag effects of carnivores in response to droughts.",

    "abstract": "Problems of having poor, rural communities value, manage, and benefit from local natural resources has been an ongoing concern in the development literature. The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) is one attempt to deal with such problems. Our study evaluates the extent to which CAMPFIRE conforms to principles contained in the original CAMPFIRE Guidelines of 1991. These early principles were meant to guide the devolution of proprietorship over wildlife to Rural District Councils (RDCs) to manage wildlife with and on behalf of local communities. In so doing, these early principles are linked to the contemporary governance theory. Our evaluation is based on data collected in Chapoto Ward, Mbire District, in northern Zimbabwe, from January to March 2017 using in-depth interviews with heads of households, key informant interviews and a focus group discussion. These were complemented by document analysis. Our evaluation shows that the principles have not been fully followed because CAMPFIRE was implemented as a strategic compromise between communities and RDCs since devolved community rights were not legally supported at the time. We suggest that policy and legislation changes be made to redesign community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) into a more robust model that enhances the full devolution of rights over wildlife and benefits to promote democratic governance and ensure bottom-up accountability.",

This paper tests the null hypothesis that spraints and couches of A. capensis are randomly distributed with regard to freshwater availability. Dependence on freshwater sources by coastal A. capensis has important conservation implications. Reduced stream flow or seasonal drying up of sources, resulting from increased human activities, can negatively affect continued otter occurrence along a coastline. Occurrence of spraints, couches and resting places along the south-west coast, South Africa, was found to be closely tied to freshwater sources. It is hypothesised from the results of this study that A. capensis, like the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, needs fresh water to use marine habitats. The results indicate that monitoring freshwater points along similar coasts would indicate whether otters were present in the general area or not - a time-saving method of determining otter distribution on a large scale. Monitoring only mouths of rivers is possible, as most spraints and couches were located very close to fresh water.",

Diet composition estimated from faecal analysis indicated that bushbuck were predominantly browsers, taking an average of 9.6% monocotyledonous plants per month. Twenty-three dicotyledons but only three monocotyledons were identified in the faeces. Preference indices showed that four plant species were utilized to a greater degree than their occurrence in the veld would suggest. Diet quality estimated from faecal samples indicated that bushbuck in the Woody Cape Nature Reserve were not suffering from nutritional limitations (as measured by % fibre, % ash and % crude protein), as their protein intake adequately met their requirements, despite the prevailing drought during the study period.

Large flocks concentrated at roost sites, water points or fruiting trees, and represented aggregations of several smaller groups. Present distributions in forest fragments reflect past distribution in a large mosaic of forest patches. Density estimates based on a census of forests, questionnaires and communications show that numbers are exceedingly low and the best estimate of numbers is 300 birds in the Eastern Cape, 150 in KwaZulu-Natal, and < 50 in the Transvaal Drakensberg. This suggests about 500 Cape parrots remaining in the wild.

A correction factor for the bluntness of ellipsoidal eggs was included. Geometry and volume were determined by using fresh lizard eggs, literature data and preserved eggs. Practical applications of volumes such as egg size comparisons, egg size determination, volume/mass ratios, and determining the accuracy of linear measurements and mass were examined. The ellipsoidal formula for determining volume and its practical applications were found to be applicable to avian eggs, and examples are given. Water displacement methods were found to be impracticable while volume determinations by mass were considered suitable.

The rate at which elephant populations grow is essential knowledge for \nelephant management. We examined growth rates of elephant populations introduced to \neight small reserves in South Africa, determined demographic parameters (age at sexual \nmaturity, calving interval, sex ratio at birth, and age-specific probabilities of conception and \nsurvival) for each population, and made short-term projections of future population growth \nbased on these parameters and the current population structure.Average annual population \ngrowth rates following introduction ranged from 5 to over 10%, and are projected to be in the \nrange of 6.2 to 8.9% over the duration of the next 20 years. Model projections suggest that \npopulations can double in less than 10 years, that calving interval is the most important \ndemographic factor determining population growth rate, and that the structure of the \nintroduced population will greatly influence future growth. Without active management to \nreduce or maintain population sizes in the next few years, small reserves throughout South \nAfrica will undoubtedly experience overpopulation of elephants within 10 to 20 years. \nPopulation growth rates of elephants in new areas and on the short term can bemuch higher \nthan expected from large, established populations.",

In common with other studied gamebirds in Natal, insects are eaten mostly in summer (October-March), and it appears that the intake is directly related to rainfall over the preceding 3 months.

This study used reviews of the prey preferences of African wild dog Lycaon pictus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, leopard Panthera pardus, lion P. leo, and spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta to investigate the degree of dietary overlap and dietary niche breadth amongst the guild. Wild dogs and cheetahs exhibited the greatest dietary overlap and smallest dietary niche breadth, while lions exhibited the least dietary overlap and, with leopards, had the broadest dietary niche breadth. Increased extinction risk within the guild was related to lower dietary niche breadth.The behavioural and morphological specializations of the two most threatened predators (wild dogs and cheetahs) limit the prey available to them, and increases the potential for dietary competition. Conversely, the large body mass and group hunting strategy of lions and the predatory flexibility of leopards and spotted hyaenas minimizes the effects of dietary overlap, assuring a more secure status. This study intimates reasons why cheetahs and African wild dogs are naturally less common than lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas in unmodified landscapes. The methods used can be applied to all adequately studied faunal guilds and could highlight previously undetected competitors.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining key ecological processes is a strong argument for conserving biodiversity, and this should extend to preventing the local extinction of keystone species that are otherwise common. Seed dispersal is such a process and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus ursinus) may facilitate seed dispersal, but currently suffer range contractions in South Africa. Between April 2016 and February 2017, we collected a total of 122 chacma baboon scat samples in a semi-arid subtropical thicket, South Africa, and identified food items and seeds from the scats. We show that chacma baboons are omnivores, able to disperse at least 24 different seed species. This is a wider range of seed species than those dispersed by a broad range of birds, reptiles or other mammals in subtropical thicket, and nearly five times that dispersed by domestic goats (Capra hircus). This suggests that baboons are key seed dispersers, whose role might not be substituted by goats. We believe that baboons may become more important seed dispersers in arid subtropical thicket as climate change alters the distributional ranges of plant communities. This important role as endo-zoochores highlights the need to conserve, rather than persecute, chacma baboons.",

Populations in semi-arid regions depend on mobility to access resources that are spatiotemporally heterogeneous. The potentially isolated wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), gemsbok (Oryx gazella) and springbok (Antidorcus marsupialis) populations in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) depend on high-quality grasslands, a limited and important vegetation type. We used microhistological analyses of dung samples from these ungulates to estimate their seasonal diet composition. Results showed that forage quality and availability drive wet season diet composition. Protein-rich short grasses on pans were important for all ungulates in the wet season. Wildebeest, gemsbok and springbok diets overlapped in the wet season. The favoured grasses were depleted during the dry season and the ungulates shifted their diet likely as an adaptive mechanism to maintain intake rates. Wildebeest fed on lower-quality grasses while springbok and gemsbok fed on dicotyledons when more preferred forage was scarce. Our findings demonstrate the importance of access to heterogeneity of vegetation types that provide high-quality resources in the wet season (saline pan grassland habitats) and dry season reserves of forage (woodland habitats).",

The success obtained with coyote getters and the avoidance of this device by black-backed jackals during three consecutive control operations (1985, 1986 & 1988) were studied. Furthermore, the sex ratio and age structure of jackals during consecutive operations were examined.

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of the greywing francolin Francolinus africanus as a gamebird, the effects of hunting on standing densities and long-term yields are not well documented. We recorded hunting effort, hunting efficiency and the impact of hunting on greywing francolin populations during 123 hunts conducted on various farms situated on the Stormberg Plateau from 1988-1991. Between-year variation in hunting effort and hunter skill was not significant. Hunter satisfaction was significantly positively correlated with the number of greywing seen, and significantly negatively correlated with hunter group size. Hunter skill was also significantly negatively correlated with hunter group size. There was no significant difference between removal levels with various hunting limits. However, populations from which more than 50% of the standing density was removed were significantly reduced in the year following the hunt. We conclude that, for sustainable, economically viable hunting, groups of between four and seven hunters should be offered between 50 and 65 greywing francolin flushed per hunt, and these populations should be hunted only once per season, with hunters removing no more than 50% of a covey.\nTen spyte van die bergpatrys Francolinus africanus se gewildheid as 'n jagvoel, is die newe effekte van jag in terme van staande digthede en langtermyn opbrengste nie goed bekend nie. Ons het die jagpoging, jagdoeltreffendheid en die impak op bergpatrysbevolkings gedurende die verloop van 123 jagte op 'n verskeidenheid plase op die Stormbergplato tussen 1988 en 1991 ontleed. Tussenjaarse variasie in jagpoging en jagbedrewenheid was nie betekenisvol verskillend nie. Jagtertevredenheid was betekenisvol positief verwant aan die aantal bergpatryse wat gesien is, en negatief verwant aan jagtergroepgrootte. Jagdoeltreffendheid was ook negatief verwant aan laasgenoemde. Daar was geen betekenisvolle verskil tussen verwyderingsvlakke in terme van 'n verskeidenheid van jagbeperkings nie. Bevolkings waarvan die staande digtheid met meer as die helfte verminder is het egter in die daaropvolgende jaar betekenisvol laer digthede getoon. Ons kom dus tot die slotsom dat vir volgehoue, ekonomies-vatbare jag, groepe bestaande uit tussen vier en sewe jagters, en tussen 50 en 65 bergpatryse per jag opgejaag word. Bergpatrysbevolkings moet egter slegs een maal per jaar gejag word, en dan slegs indien daar nooit meer as 50% van 'n enkele trop verwyder word nie.",

In the Free State a 2-3 fold increase in the Sacred Ibis breeding population took place during the years 1972-1995, attributed to the intensification of agriculture practices and the creation of new dams. Sacred Ibis nests were built mainly of sticks and twigs, but quite often greenery was used. Nests were situated relatively low in the tree, and in each colony they were subdivided into smaller groups. If a colony was situated on an island, some nests, or all, were placed on the ground.

    "abstract": "The vegetation in permanently marked plots was monitored by means of point surveys for canopy spread cover over a six-year period. This period spanned the drought of the early 19805 and the wetter phase of the late 19805. In some respects the observed changes in the abundance of the different plant species conformed to the successional model which forms the basis of veld condition assessment in the Karoo. Annual grasses, as well as the creeping grass Tragus koelerioides, spread rapidly during the first two wet seasons after the end of the drought. They later declined in abundance, presumably as a result of competition with taller, tufted perennial grasses, which showed a slower but more sustained increase in abundance. However, the nature of the rainfall-induced changes differed between the two main plant communities in the study area: the Themeda triandra -Cymbopogon plurinodis community on stony areas and the Cynodon incompletus - Pentzia species community which occurred on less stony areas. Themeda triandra and Cymbopogon plurinodis never became abundant in the latter community, despite the improved rainfall and despite five years of protection against large herbivores in fenced exclosures. The two communities thus retained their distinctness throughout the observation period. The results are examined in relation to published hypotheses of the effect of winter and summer rain on the cover of grass and dwarf shrubs.\nDie plantegroei in permanent gemerkte persele is vir 'n tydperk van ses jaar deur middel van puntopnames vir kroonuitstrekkingsbedekking gemoniteer. Hierdie tydperk het die droogtetye van die vroee 1980's en die natter laat 1980's ingesluit. In sekere opsigte het die waarnemings met die suksessiemodel waarop die veldtoestandsindeks vir die Karoo gebaseer is, ooreengestem. Die eerste twee nat jare wat op die droogte gevolg het, weerspieel 'n toename in eenjarige en kruipende grassoorte. Mettertyd het die bedekking van die eenjarige en kruipende grassoorte egter afgeneem. Dit kan moontlik aan kompetisie met die langer, meerjarige polgrasse toegeskryf word, alhoewel bedekking deur die polgrasse stadiger, maar meer volgehoue toegeneem het.

    "abstract": "A comparison was made between two tree canopy volume estimation techniques by using data collected in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The methods were Biomass Estimates from Canopy Volume (BECVOL) and Arbour Structure (ARBORSTRUQ). Both these methods depend on the mathematical calculation of the volume of geometric shapes, using associated computer programs. The methods were compared on the basis of ease of implementation and similarity of results. Field data were read into both computer programs in order to calculate canopy volumes derived for 13 sample plots. The results were then subjected to an analysis of variance test (ANOVA), which showed no significant difference between the methods when calculating the total canopy volume. However, there was a significant difference in partial canopy volume estimation up to a 2 m browse level due to the different mathematical models used for the volume calculations. In ease of application, the ARBORSTRUQ is more user friendly, whereas the BECVOL one is a more comprehensive package.",

    "abstract": "Small-mammal recolonization of a fire-exclusion catchment in the Natal Drakensberg Park was investigated by live-trapping at six-monthly intervals for four years after unscheduled burning. During the first two years the pattern of recolonization was similar to that found in biennially burnt grassland during previous studies in the Drakensberg; although numbers were initially lower. Low numbers during the first year may have been due to the extent of the burn (all surrounding grassland was also burnt), with limited nuclei from which recolonization could take place. During the second year, both the extent of the burn and low spring and early summer rainfall are believed to have affected the rate of population increase of small mammals. At the end of the third year, after average rainfall, total numbers reached a peak, slightly higher than numbers recorded in the catchment before it was burnt, and much higher than those recorded in pure grassland, where numbers generally start to decline markedly three or four years after burning. In the fire-exclusion area the vegetation contained a high woody plant component, which developed in the absence of fire, with an understorey of grass and forbs. Recovery of this vegetation had taken place by three years, and it is hypothesized that small-mammal recolonization did not follow the pattern previously recorded at three to four years post fire in grassland, but advanced beyond the decline and consequent low observed in pure grassland to the situation that exists in long-term fire-exclusion areas where woody vegetation has developed.",

The aim was to obtain information on quality of diet selected during different seasons and to determine intake to facilitate calculation of carrying capacity of veld for impala. Forage selection was measured by analysis of oesophageal extrusa from fistulated impala. Faeces were collected in faecal bags and intake was estimated by the ratio organic matter (OM) excreted to the indigestible fraction. Crude protein (CP) selected varied between 6 and 13% on a dry matter (OM) basis, was significantly higher in the wet season than during August to October but lower than during May to July when significant amounts of browse were selected. Digestibility of OM and cell wall constituents was significantly lower during dry than wet months. In vitro digestibility of OM varied between 40 and 70% and OM intake between 900 and 1900 g/day in dry and wet months respectively. Most of the variation in intake and digestibility was explained by variation in lignin content of oesophageal extrusa, with additional variation being accounted for by variation in CP content. Energy intake of 0,64 MJ ME/kg W0.75/day corresponded to published estimates of energy requirements for male impala.\nDie studie is met vry-weidende rooibokramme Aepyceros melampus by die Timbavati Privaat Natuurreservaat onderneem. Die doel was om inligting te bekom oor kwaliteit van dieet geselekteer en om inname van rooibokke te bepaal, ten einde meer akkurate beramings van drakrag moontlik te maak. Voedselseleksie is gemeet deur slukdermmonsters van gefistuleerde rooibokke te ontleed.

Die grootste gedeelte van die variasie in inname en verteerbaarheid is deur die variasie in lignieninhoud van slukdermmonsters verklaar, terwyl die variasie in RP-inhoud 'n verdere bydrae gelewer het.

All of the body condition indices were significantly (p < 0,05) higher in adults (g 24 months of age) than in lambs (≤ 12 months) and yearlings (13 to 24 months). There was a significant seasonal variation in PCV and MDW in lambs, but not in the yearlings and adults. KFI varied with the reproductive status of adults, but there was only a slight seasonal variation in lambs and yearlings (p ≈ 0,1). VBC was poor in lambs, yearlings and adult males in the winter and spring, and good in the summer. In adult females VBC was fair / good in the winter and poor in the summer when they were nursing. VBC and PCV were lower in lambs in the unmanaged area than the managed area, and VBC, PCV, MDW and KFI were lower in yearlings in the unmanaged area. Only a combined index, MDW < 85% and KFI < 20%, differed significantly between areas in the adults. Despite significant differences between areas, the body condition indices were not sensitive indicators of habitat condition. The indices may provide information on the relative condition of individuals, but habitat effects may be restricted to small segments of the population, and can only be assessed when there is a proper control group.\nVier indekse van liggaamskondisie : sigbare liggaamskondisie (SLK) verpakte selvolume (VSV), murg-droe-gewig (MDG) en niervetindeks (NVI), is oor 'n tydperk van 12 maande by rooibokke in 'n bestuurde gebied en 'n onbestuurde, oorbevolkte gebied in die Mlawula-Mbuluzi-Simunye Natuurreservaat- en Bewaarde Gebied-kompleks in noordoos-Swaziland, ondersoek.

Based on biomass, PCGs prey mostly on rodents, but also small birds, hatchling tortoises, small snakes, lizards, sunspiders, harvester termites, grasshoppers, beetles and carrion. Published observations of PCG prey are not in dose agreement with these results, since many large birds, but few invertebrates were reported. For the three dominant prey species combined, Otomys unisulcatus, Parotomys brantsii and Rhabdomys pumilio, the proportion of the biomass was the highest for polyandrous (93%) and monogamous groups (91%) from Karroid Broken Veld. Since cooperative polyandry was only reported from this vegetation type, the selection of these rodents appears to be an important component of habitat quality for these birds. Stocking rates of ostriches Struthio camelus, for which the study area is utilized almost exclusively, may be critical for the conservation of this rare mating system since changes in habitat structure owing to the ostriches' avoidance of shrubs and succulents may benefit the otomyinids directly. Alternatively, high stocking rates that open up the habitat may impact negatively on otomyinid abundance.",

    "abstract": "The results of helicopter-based counts of some South African animal species in the Northern Cape Province are presented. A distance-based estimator is used to provide a correction for those individuals present but not seen. Two different types of helicopter with a different number of observers are compared. The results indicate significant undercounting even for the largest species. Increasing the number of observers provided a less biased and more precise estimate. Visibility profiles for some species are presented. For most species the proportion of the population seen beyond 200 m from the helicopter is small. An estimator for the variance of total counts is derived, based on the visibility profiles and is evaluated for a selection of species. The results indicate that attempts to count animals up to 400 m from the aircraft provide an estimate which is both more biased and less precise than estimates obtained by counting animals in the first 200 m only. We also suggest that the proportion of animals seen with small helicopters with fewer observers, as generally used in game counting on wildlife ranches, is lower than in this study.\nDie resultate van 'n bevolkingsopname per helikopter van sommige Suid-Afrikaanse diersoorte in die Noord-Kaap provinsie word aangebied.

Twee verskillende tipes helikpoter met verskillende getalle waarnemers in elk is vergelyk. Aansienlike ondertellings vir selfs groot diere is gemaak. 'n Toename in die getal waarnemers het 'n minder sydige en meer presiese beraming tot gevolg gehad. Sigbaarheidsprofiele word vir sekere spesies aangebied.

'n Skatter vir die variansie van totale tellings, gegrond op die sighaarheidsprofiele, is afgelei, en word geevalueer vir 'n seleksie van spesies. Die resultate dui aan dat pogings om diere te tel tot sover as 400 m weg van die helikopter minder presies en meer sydig is as tellings waar diere net tot 200 m weg getel word. Ons stel ook voor dat die proporsie van diere wet waargeneem word met kleiner helikopters met minder waarnemers, soos normaalweg op wildplase gebruik word, laer sal wees as in hierdie ondersoek.",

Six species (three cestodes, two nematodes and one acanthocephalan) were identified. Helminths were found in all but one of the tracts. Nematodes were found only in the caeci, cestodes and acanthocephalans in the intestinal lumen. Using a volumetric index of level of infestation, juvenile guineafowl had higher levels of infestation by cestodes and acanthocephalans than did adults. The highest levels of helminth infestation of adult guineafowl were found in specimens collected in July 1975. In savanna habitat, adults had higher levels of nematode infestation in June 1974 than in June 1975. In July 1975, adult guineafowl in riverine habitat had higher levels of helminth infestation than those in savanna habitat. In June 1975, in riverine habitat, adult males had higher levels of nematode infestation than females. High levels of infestation in juvenile guineafowl are presumed to be the result of a greater intake of intermediate hosts and a lower resistance to infection. High levels of infestation in adult guineafowl are attributed to an interaction between high population density and soil moisture content at the time of infection. None of the guineafowl showed any signs of gross pathological condition. Therefore observed infestation is presumed to be at a tolerable level",

    "abstract": "The largest area of the South African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) distribution occurs outside formally protected areas, making cheetahs vulnerable to conflict-related killings. This conflict is assumed to be related to negative attitudes of landowners towards predators. Our study assessed the socio-economic factors influencing landowner attitudes towards cheetahs on private properties adjacent to the Kruger National Park (Kruger), South Africa. We used structured questionnaires to interview 199 landowners. Attitudes of landowners towards cheetahs were generally positive; 58% of landowners had attitude index scores between eight and 11. However, 11% had fairly negative or low scores (scores between -2 and 4). First language, land use and respondent knowledge of cheetahs were key drivers of attitude. English speaking landowners (49.8%) were more likely to display positive attitudes towards cheetahs than Afrikaans first-language speakers (46.8%). In addition, the likelihood of having a more positive attitude increased significantly as respondent knowledge of cheetahs increased. Attitudes were also influenced by land use, with wildlife ranchers or ecotourism ventures having a significantly higher probability of having more positive attitudes than livestock farmers. With the Kruger being a stronghold for cheetah conservation in Africa, and large carnivores being vulnerable to edge effects in protected areas, it is important to understand the factors driving conflict so that mitigation efforts can be targeted for maximum impact.",

We monitored hyraxes at 20 observation stations in the 424 km2 RMNP over a 13-year period (1993–2005). We identified hyraxes to species, and counted and aged them. From yearly counts and age distributions, we computed an index of relative abundance (AI - individuals/km2) and estimate of productivity (proportion of the sample comprising juveniles) for each species. Time series analysis showed that annual fluctuations in AI were marked, but not cyclic, with ranges of 0.4–113.8% (median = 30.0%) for Heterohyrax brucei and 3.7–64.7% (median = 11.0%) for Procavia capensis. Cross-correlation function revealed interspecific synchrony in annual fluctuation in numbers of individuals of the two species. A positive relationship existed between AI of H. brucei and rainfall of the previous austral summer, suggesting that annual precipitation contributes to fluctuations in abundance of this species; synchronous fluctuation of the two species suggests a common response to other regulating factors. Additional abiotic and biotic processes that potentially affected populations of both species are chronicled.",

This study investigates resource selection on woody plant species by two vervet monkey (vervet) troops living in human-modified mixed-broadleaf savanna in South Africa. Our findings indicate that one troop's home range was more diverse in terms of woody plant species than the other. No relationship between the frequency of occurrence of resource items in the diet and the availability of those items was found for either troop, suggesting that food selection is not based on availability. However, resource items were selected in proportion to their energy content, indicating that vervets are potentially energy maximizers (species that select resource items based on energy content). This was noticeable for the vervets living in the more diverse home range. Vervets in the less diverse home range displayed less clear preference for higher energy food items. Despite this disparity between the troops, our findings suggest that both troops used whatever resource items were available to them, and that it is important to maximize the tree diversity in vervet habitats to ensure population persistence and reduce conflict with humans.",

    "abstract": "Human population increase and anthropogenic land-use changes are impacting biodiversity globally. Despite an increasing trend in urban wildlife studies, a systematic assessment of mammalian small carnivores in urban areas is still lacking. We evaluated urban studies in international peer-reviewed journals using a systematic review process. We assessed urban wildlife publications from 1970–2021 to quantify trends over time regarding the taxonomic family and geographical focus of publications across the globe. Urban small carnivore studies have increased progressively through the decades, with 87.2% of all studies conducted in the last 20 years. Geographically, we found that small carnivore studies were disproportionately conducted, with 77.0% of all studies taking place in either North America (46.5%) or Europe (30.5%). Furthermore, the United States of America (39.8%) and the United Kingdom (11.4%) contributed to 51.2% of all studies focused on small carnivores. We found seven carnivore families represented in urban studies, consisting of 76 species. Two canid species, Vulpes vulpes (21.9%) and Canis latrans (16.9%), accounted for 38.8% of all studies conducted on urban small carnivores. The majority of studies took place in mixed or urban areas (79.8%), with suburban and exurban zones explored to a lesser extent (16.6%). Animal behaviour was the most studied scientific topic (24.6%), with the least being species conservation (0.3%). Critical gaps persist in the research of small mammalian carnivores, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas of Asia, Africa and South America. While the field of urban ecology will certainly continue to advance, we urge future research to adopt a multi-disciplinary stance that explores the landscape transitional zones, from the periphery of the urban core (sub-urban, peri-urban and exurban) into natural systems; or urban mosaic landscapes with natural and managed green spaces as refugia. The importance of urban fringe and margin areas for small carnivores remains largely unknown.",

The gerbils were primarily insectivorous but also consumed some green plant material. Insects supply the protein, and plant tissues the vitamins and minerals, necessary for the maintenance of reproduction. Precipitation drove the system, regulated primary production, and hence determined gerbil population dynamics; plane of nutrition or a reproductive trigger initiated breeding, but requires experimentation. Juvenile recruitment was postponed, despite an apparent sufficiency of food resources during reproduction, and was likely inhibited by reproduction-related aggression of adults. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors are implicated in controlling the demographic processes of gerbils in the Namib Desert dunefields.",

    "abstract": "The aardwolf (Proteles cristata) is a unique. insectivorous species of the family Hyaenidae. It occupies a disjunct range in eastern and southern Africa and is possibly a remaining member of a historical dog-like hyaena Glade. Although both local and global population status and trends are largely unknown, aardwolves are not uncommon in arid grasslands and the IUCN conservation status of Least Concern appears to be justified. However, they are one of the least studied of the four hyaena species, and we have scarce information about the genetic structure of aardwolf populations. Here, we present the first complete aardwolf mitochondrial genomes and provide novel information about aardwolf evolutionary origins and genetic structure within a single population. Through the investigation of complete mitochondrial genomes from five individuals from a single population within South Africa, we find the mitochondrial diversity of this population to be neither particularly high nor low compared to a number of other mammalian species. Moreover, we also provide additional evidence towards the basal position of the aardwolf within Hyaenidae with a divergence time of 13.0 Ma (95% CI 10.1-16.4 Ma) from all other extant hyaena species.",

To monitor the stress caused by this practise, a non-invasive method assessing adrenocortical function as a measure of stress would minimize disturbance during sample collection. In our study, an adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge, and a mass-capture event were used to examine the suitability of five enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring stress-related physiological responses using faeces as a sample matrix. The tested 11-oxoaetiocholanolone I EIA performed best, showing a 2126% increase above baseline after 22 h for a male, and a 474% increase for a female 23 h post-ACTH injection. Baseline faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations did not differ between animals captured on either day 1 or day 2 of the capture event, indicating that the frequent presence of a helicopter during the two days did not influence fGCM concentrations. However, during capture-related restraint for up to 10 h, an overall 1.5-fold elevation in (fGCM) concentrations was found. Storage of faeces at ambient temperature post-defecation indicated a fair stability of fGCMs for up to 8 h. The ability to reliably assess adrenocortical function provides a solid basis to examine endocrine responses to putative stressful circumstances in blue wildebeest.",

However, the importance of the lakes as a temporary site for migrant bird populations has not been adequately studied. The point count method was used to study waterbird species diversity and abundance in Lake Ashenge, in the semi-arid region of northern Ethiopia, with the main aim to underscore the lake's importance as a stop-over site for Palaearctic and other migratory birds. A total of 36 species belonging to 14 waterbird families were encountered. Fifteen of the species were resident birds, including the endemic Wattled Ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), and 14 of the species were Palaearctic migrants, including the globally Near-Threatened Ferruginous Duck (Ayithya nyroca) and Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa). Significant temporal variation in diversity and abundance was observed during the study period; diversity was highest (Shannon-Wiener H′ = 1.98) in the dry season (December/January) and lowest (H′ = 1.11) in the rainy season (August/September), whereas mean abundance was highest (c. 4219 individuals) in the post-rainy season (October/November) and lowest (c. 2631 individuals) in the dry season. Increased abundance of Palaearctic species towards the dry season increased species diversity,but may have caused displacement of resident birds resulting in lower overall abundance in this season. This study provides a new distributional record for Maccoa Duck, highlights the significance of the lake for several waterbird species and calls for its protection.",

We monitored the diurnal activities of breeding white-faced whistling ducks Dendrocygna viduata on stock-watering ponds and dams associated with the Nyl River floodplain, South Africa, from December 1992 to March 1993. Activity patterns diverge from those of north-temperate breeding ducks; apparently a result of differences in environment and resource availability. While most species of north-temperate breeding ducks spend large portions of the day aquatic foraging, male and female white-faced whistling ducks foraged on stock-ponds for only 4.0% and 9.8% of the day, respectively. white-faced whistling ducks were able to satisfy most of their daily dietary requirements during crepuscular foraging flights to neighboring Panicum schinzii fields. This permitted them to spend most of the day in comfort-related activities (sleeping, loafing, preening) (males 49% of the day, females 67%), which presumably has important energetic implications for reproducing birds. Low foraging effort is also indicative of a low aquatic resource availability on the stock-watering ponds studied, relative to north-temperate wetlands. Thermal stress associated with high summer temperatures in South Africa apparently influenced daily activity patterns because feeding, locomotion, courtship, and aggression were rarely observed during the hottest parts of the day. While stock ponds provide limited foraging opportunities, they do supply habitat for comfort-related activities, a critical requirement of waterfowl.",

In other cases, indirect measurements were taken from similar plant structures in the immediate vicinity. Significant correlations were obtained between the measurements and mass of these plant structures. By combining frequency indexation, linear measurements, and sample weighing, a representative subsample can be determined for use in chemical analyses of food plants.\n'n Metode word voorgestel om die voerinname van vrylewende olifantbulle in privaat wildreservate langs die Nasionale Krugerwildtuin deur spoorvolging te bemonster. Beraming van 'bytgrootte' vorm die basis van hierdie tegniek en is as akkuraat genoeg bevind vir algemene toepassing in die veld. Twee- en driedimensionele afmetings van benutte blare en bas is direk vanaf takke of wortels bepaal. In ander gevalle kon indirekte afmetings van soortgelyke plantstrukture in die onmiddellike omgewing gemaak word. Betekenisvolle korrelasies is tussen die afmetings en massa van hierdie plantstrukture verkry. Deur benuttingsfrekwensie, lineere afmetings en massabepalings van monsters te kombineer, kan 'n verteenwoordigende submonster vir gebruik vir chemiese analise van voedselplante bepaal word.",

During the early summer breeding season, all sites sampled (n = 50) from 10 farms had grassveld cover (i.e. area of plant matter per unit volume of space) values lower than those recorded at two guineafowl nests. Although there was a negative relationship between stocking rates and the average grassveld cover per farm during early summer, a positive relationship was found between guineafowl abundance and grassveld cover for this period. High summer grazing pressure and intensive winter burning programmes may thus limit suitable grassland cover for nesting guineafowl in early summer. A reduction in sheep farming may also have contributed to the decline in guineafowl numbers. Further study is required to establish if the degradation of grasslands and the size and distribution of suitable nest patches on intensively farmed properties have reduced nesting success and, ultimately, contributed to the declining helmeted guineafowl populations.",

In each trial, both groups showed increased values of lactate, glucose, haematocrit, osmolarity, cortisol and catecholamines compared with values in impala under M99 immobilization.

Because customer expectations are pre-trial beliefs or desires about service delivery that serve as points of reference against which performance and quality is judged, it is important that game ranchers understand the nature and antecedents of hunters' expectations. Effectively managing adequate, desired and predicted expectations about the hunting experience, along with perceived performance, can intensify hunters' loyalty to a point where they are unreceptive to competitive offers.

    "abstract": "Large carnivores are key drivers of ecosystem structure and function, yet their populations are declining worldwide. African lion (Panthera leo) populations have decreased significantly in recent decades with an estimated 23 000 lions left in Africa. Successful conservation efforts rely on a sound understanding of how animals utilize their surrounding habitat. We used movement data from GPS collars to investigate patterns and drivers of seasonal space use by free-roaming lions in the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area (GM-TFCA). We developed individual and population-level resource utilization functions (RUF) from 2008 to 2015. RUFs relate non-uniform space use within a home range to landscape metrics in a multiple regression framework. We identified six landscape features hypothesized a priori to be good predictors of lion space use: land use, land cover, elevation, terrain ruggedness, distance to human settlements and rivers. Only elevation during the dry season was a significant factor detected for lion space use ( ± S.E.) (-0.278 ± 0.107, CI = -0.4881, -0.0676). Across seasons, lions varied in their avoidance of human settlements, but 12 of 18 (67%) individuals selected areas within their home ranges that were farther from human settlements. Lions moved randomly across the landscape independent of vegetation type regardless of season. In season-specific analyses, some lions avoided human settlements (dry season: 45%, [n = 10] utilized areas farther from settlements; wet season: 50% [n = 9]). The lack of avoidance of settlements by some lions in our study also confirms that individual variation among lions can lead to human—wildlife conflicts. Perhaps the most critical observation from our study is that individual lions acted very differently as they used the landscape, which suggests the need for management plans to be landscape and case-specific.",

The commitment and participation of local people in conservation activities, however, are crucial for conservation success. Here we assess attitudes and perceptions towards rhino poaching and conservation in light of surveys in two local communities adjacent to the Hlane Royal National Park in eSwatini where perhaps 100 black (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhino occur. Our survey of 60 households addressed perceptions and attitudes towards rhino conservation and willingness to participate in rhino poaching and conservation activities. No efforts have been made to involve local people in conservation activities, and the people do not benefit from the park's activities. About 20% of respondents expressed their willingness to help rhino poachers provided they are paid for their services. Of the remaining 80%, some mentioned that they would not help poachers for fear of being apprehended. Still, some mentioned that they would not help poachers because of their concern about poaching and believe its prevention is important. Park authorities here and elsewhere could invest in building better people–park relationships, and provide opportunities for local communities to participate in conservation activities. Conservation policies to co-manage the resources could be used to deter poaching and to conserve wildlife involving local community members in monitoring and enforcement strategies.",

The distribution, availability and quality of resources, burnt areas, and potential inter-specific competition all play a role in sustaining populations of large sympatric African herbivores. We investigated the role of resources, constraints and interspecific relationships on habitat use by three ruminants – black and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou, C. taurinus) and red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), and a non-ruminant, plains zebra (Equus quagga), across seasons and in different landscape types in a South African reserve. Black wildebeest, blue wildebeest and red hartebeest preferred the open grassland landscape, with homogeneous vegetation, while zebra favoured the wooded grassland landscape, with more heterogeneous vegetation. Burnt areas and vegetation greenness were important for all species, while elevation represented a constraint for black wildebeest only. The presence/absence of other species was important in shaping landscape use for black and blue wildebeest, and this suggests the possibility of competition. Our findings confirm the importance of heterogeneity and, in particular, the important role of a planned burning regime in maintaining such heterogeneity to sustain multi-species herbivore assemblages in small fenced nature reserves, where competition might arise between species using similar resources.",

The nematode and protozoan fauna of the Cape Peninsula baboon population was similar to both neighbouring and geographically distinct chacma baboon populations in South Africa. Parasite prevalence was variable across study sites and seasonality did not appear to have an effect on patterns of infection. The finding of the eggs of an ascarid, possibly Ascaris sp., in the Cape Peninsula baboon population represents the first report of this nematode genus in wild baboons in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "African forests have been negatively affected because of human impacts. The use of forest products is high for lower-income communities. Excessive logging alters the forest patch structure and composition, causing degradation. In addition, increases in bushmeat hunting for sustenance and trade result in increased pressures on forest mammalian species. We investigated forest use by rural communities residing around forest patches in uMthatha, Eastern Cape, and iNgeli and Creighton, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We selected villages to conduct interviews based on their proximity to forest patches sampled during our camera trap surveys (May 2018 – June 2019). We conducted 303 interviews using semi-structured questionnaires and analysed these. A higher proportion of respondents (38%, n = 117) conveyed that the forest extent increased over ten years, mainly because the settlement residents did not use the forest often. Afrocarpus falcatus and Ptaeroxylon obliquum were the preferred native tree species to be logged because of their sturdiness and durability for building structures and fencing. The most hunted mammalian species included the southern bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus ) and common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia ). The most significant reason for residents hunting was for consumption, followed by financial gain. According to respondents, ungulates are the most frequently targeted for consumption in lower-income settlements and are an important source of protein. Some participants in our study expressed that mammalian species' numbers are dwindling because of people overhunting. An emerging trend in our study was the high cultural importance placed on the forest. Forest resources are more likely to be used sustainably if appropriate measures such as capacity building for security guards as well as clear rules and regulations about hunting and plant harvesting are applied. Incorporating socio-economic aspects into ecological management is of benefit for forest conservation.",

    "abstract": "Most of the bird species in the Succulent and Nama Karoo, South Africa, are represented in statutory protected areas. However, representation in larger protected areas (>10 km2) is poor, particularly in the Succulent Karoo. Priority species for protection are the Karoo endemic birds, dryland and aquatic nomadic species, and larks (Alaudidae). Localities that are species-poor, but rich in Karoo-endemic species, lack protected areas, and it is to these parts of the Karoo that conservation initiatives should be directed. We used a Geographical Information System (GIS) approach and databases compiled by the Southern African Bird Atlas Project and Cape Nature Conservation to identify parts of the Succulent and Nama Karoo that contain particular elements of the avifauna, and identified a set of localities in the Succulent and Nama Karoo that could be further investigated for suitable potential protected sites. All of the potential protected sites are in rangelands in the Karoo and are currently used for livestock production. We considered the effect of the removal of productive rangelands from livestock ranching and concluded that this might be important to the national economy if the area was large and particularly productive. Fifteen quarter-degree squares (ODS) were identified as first-tier priorities for further investigation for protected areas, 11 ODS as second-tier priorities and a block of squares in the north central Nama Karoo as worthy of investigation for protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Browse preferences of African elephants Loxodonta africana in Natal bushveld which had not experienced elephant utilisation since 1860 were determined and used to anticipate likely changes in the woody vegetation community following elephant re-introduction. Elephants were observed to feed on 31 species of trees and woody shrubs during the course of the study but their efforts were concentrated on 10 species for which over 80% of the feeding events and 85% of the bites taken were recorded. Generally, diet selection was for Acacia caffra and broad-leafed woodland species belonging to later successional stages whilst earlier successional species, such as A. nilotica, were less utilised. During the course of the study, 25 trees were pushed over. Eighty per cent of these were members of later successional stages. Single-stemmed trees were more often felled than multi-stemmed species. Our results suggest that the use of Natal bushveld vegetation by elephants in the absence of fire will result in a dense, early successional, multi-stemmed stand of woody species instead of an open grassland or a broad-leafed open woodland community.",

A third haulout, \nwhich is referred to as the \nwinter haulout, has received minimal attention and reasons for this haulout remain obscure. Here we estimated future survival and capture (resighting) probabilities of southern elephant seals that wintered at Marion Island during their first three years and compared these values to similar estimates from individuals that were not observed to winter over the \nsame periods. We used longitudinal recapture data from the \npopulation and applied the \nprogram MARK to obtain these estimates. We found no significant differences in survival between wintering and non-wintering elephant seals. This suggests that survival is not a fitness correlate of this behaviour. However, seals of both sexes wintering at Marion Island in their first, and females wintering in their third year had significantly higher future capture probabilities relative to non-wintering seals. We thereby provide \nunique evidence of differential site fidelity within age- and sex classes, which has implications for population modelling.",

Condition indices (Kidney Fat Index and Bone Marrow Fat Index) indicated that the food resource was not limiting during the study. Differences in these indices between sexes were explained in terms of reproductive demands. Foraging efficiency of adults (as measured by Acceptable Food Abundance) declined in the cool dry season, and corresponded to a raised browse component in the diet. In the wet season, animals devoted less of their foraging time to feeding. Diet composition and foraging efficiency were related to the nature of the Panicum resource, which was in turn controlled by water level changes.

The objective was to identify significant habitat variables influencing the distribution of kudu and to construct a model for predicting kudu distribution. Manly’s index showed that kudu selected the Aristida bipartita–Setaria sphacelata Savanna variation throughout the year, probably because of the abundance of youngAcaciakarroo in this plant community. Bachelor males also preferred plant communities on lithosol soils, with Combretum species as the common tree. The analysis of variance and Tukey’s test showed that plant communities generally differed significantly (P < 0.05) from one another in terms of woody plant structure and forage availability. Multiple regression analysis was used to construct predictive models for kudu breeding distribution. Eight significant habitat variables were isolated for the summer modely =b1 woody plant density +b2 % woody canopy cover + b3 leaf volume +b4 leaf mass +b5 leaf mass below 2 m +b6 browse tree equivalent +b7 foliage height diversity of maximum canopy diameter +b8 foliage height diversity at lowest leaf. The winter model consists of four variablesy =b1 woody plant density +b2 % woody plant canopy cover + b3 foliage height diversity of maximum canopy diameter + b4 foliage height diversity of lowest leaf. Model variables suggest that habitat utilization by breeding herds was influenced by forage availability, measured as leaf volume and leaf mass, within a feeding height of <2 m and with a high structural diversity. Woody plant density and percentage canopy cover probably also serve as cover for protection. The winter model would be most applicable to predict breeding herd distribution. However this needs to be tested against independent data before it can be applied successfully.",

Changes in the natural social-ecological conditions of reintroduced lions can lead to a breakdown of natural predator–prey relationships and this is undesirable from both a biodiversity conservation and wildlife management perspective. Here, we present lion population vital rates across 16 small, fenced reserves in South Africa to test whether varying social ecological conditions, associated with lion population structures, can drive changes in vital rates. Study reserves were categorized (A–D) according to the number of resident prides and male coalitions. Lion population structure within a reserve affected lion vital rates differentially, and lion population growth was highest in reserves that contained a single resident pride. The presence of more than one pride in a reserve resulted in a younger age at first birth and marginally longer birth intervals. The presence of extra-pride adult males reduced cub survival, lioness age at first birth and birth intervals. These results can inform lion management decisions and, in particular, how lion population structure affects management outcomes. Our results also inform appropriate management protocols for lions depending on the specific social and ecological context of an individual reserve.",

These data were analysed using the Jacobs' index for prey preference, the Pianka's index for dietary overlap and Levin's index for dietary niche breadth. Leopards (Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) had a high degree of dietary overlap and were specialized in their diet selection. Lions (Panthera leo), brown (Parahyaena brunnea) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) also showed a high degree of dietary overlap and had broad diets.

For the aerial survey, a Piper PA-18 Super Cub aircraft was flown once along each of the three major rivers and associated pans in November 2008. We recorded a total of 187 hippos and 19 groups in the GNP. All sightings were in Runde River, Tambohata Pan and Massasanya Dam (density = 2.4 hippos/km). We found three trends in hippo populations in the GNP for the period 1965-2008. First, the period 1965-1982 was characterized by a significant increase in the hippo population (simple linear regression: loge[hippo population estimate] = 0.05[year] - 89.01; F1,13 = 56.26, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.81; average annual exponential rate of increase [r] = 0.05,95% confidence interval [CI] for r = 0.03-0.06); second, the period 1983-1997 was characterized by a significant hippo population decline (simple linear regression: loge[hippo population estimate] = 355.87 - 0.18[year]; F1,10 =10.44, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.51; r = -0.18, 95% CI for r = -0.30 to -0.05) and thirdly, r between two survey counts in 1997 and 2008 was 0.06. We attributed the overall decline in hippo abundance, the disappearance of the hippos in the Mwenezi River, and their huge decline in the Save River in the GNP primarily to past droughts, siltation and persecution in adjacent communal areas. We recommend collaborative efforts by the relevant authorities to ensure a continuous flow of water in the Mwenezi River. This will allow for the maintenance of hippo habitats downstream of the Manyuchi Dam, thus creating conducive environment for the re-establishment of the hippos in the Mwenezi River section in GNP. We also recommend that GNP's management should continue to monitor the hippo population and distribution in the park's major rivers and natural pans.",

    "abstract": "Insectivorous bats are vital components of tropical and subtropical ecosystems in Africa. However, they are not only threatened by habitat fragmentation, agriculture and urbanization but are also difficult animals to study. During 2014, we used acoustic monitoring to assess the activity and relative abundance of three functional guilds of insectivorous bats at eight sites along the Chobe River floodplain, Botswana. The activity of clutter and clutter-edge foragers was significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season. By contrast, open-air foragers, which typically forage above or away from vegetation, were more active in the wet season than in the dry season. We believe that the availability of natural vegetation and the variability in the detection of the three bat functional guilds by our acoustic detectors likely explain our results. Although bats are volant animals, our study points towards the importance of conserving important structural vegetation elements along the Chobe River floodplain landscape. Large river systems in Africa, such as the Chobe River, are vital for insectivorous bat persistence, and the provision of the ecosystem services they provide. As such, conservation of riparian corridors along rivers is crucial for maintaining intact and diverse bat communities.",

    "abstract": "The hippopotamus population along the Runde River in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, attained a density in the late 1970s which threatened vegetation resources of this semi-arid park. A sample of 105 hippopotami taken in 1978 was used to determine the population's age and sex structure, and reproductive characteristics. An average school consisted of 11.4 individuals, comprising 2.2 adult bulls, 4.6 adult cows, 2.2 and 1.4 immature males and females, respectively, and 0.8 calves. Females constituted 54% of the population, and 58% of foetuses; neither differed from parity. Testes mass and seminiferous tubule diameter increased with age according to a logistic function. Puberty commenced at about 4 years, and sexual maturity at 8–8.3 years, respectively at 47% (655 kg) and 65% (1070 kg) of mean adult male mass. Males were physically mature by 17.5 years. Based on the development of ovary mass, uterus mass, and uterine horn length of non-pregnant or pregnant females, the pubertal interval was 24 months commencing at 7 years when body mass reached 71% of mean adult female mass (964 kg), and sexual maturity commenced when body mass reached 78% of mean adult female mass (1050 kg). Females attained physical maturity at 13 years. Conceptions occurred in seven of eight sampled months, with most occurring in June and peak parturition estimated to occur in February. The pregnancy rate of sexually mature females was 36.8%, the incidence of pregnancy was 0.56 calves/female/year, anoestrus was 13.7 months, post-partum oestrus was 5.7 months, and the calving interval was 21.7 months. Calf mortality (<2 years) was 42%. Female births per female of reproductive age was 0.092. Reproductive characteristics of hippopotamus across Africa illustrate their plasticity in relation to climatic variation and population density, suggesting populations may be regulated without any need for management intervention.",

    "abstract": "A major threat to the survival of many reptile species is the consequence of rapid growth of the human population. The acceleration of associated anthropogenic activities causes fragmented and transformed habitats, placing the survival of biodiversity in transformed areas at risk. The sungazer (Smaug giganteus) is a threatened (Vulnerable) grassland specialist lizard species. Its geographic distribution is significantly impacted by agriculture and mining activities, resulting in major threats to the species. We assessed sungazer population demographics and dynamics at four sites, each with different habitat conditions by resurveying sungazer subpopulations first surveyed in 2004. Individuals were marked with passive integrated transponders. Abundance declined by more than 50% at two sites associated with mines and an overgrazed site over the 12 to 16-year period between surveys, and the proportion of recaptures were also the lowest in these sites (<15%). Most recaptured lizards were not found in their original burrows, and most lizards in transformed habitats were found more than 100 m away from their original burrows. Our results highlight the potentially detrimental effects of habitat transformation on sungazer demographics that have not previously been detected. Previous assessments focused on the local extinction of aggregations but not declines in abundance in aggregations that had not yet gone extinct. Our results suggest that the species may be more susceptible to habitat transformation than previously estimated. We recommend careful, continuous monitoring of sungazer subpopulations at fine spatial resolutions such that swift conservation action can be taken.",

    "abstract": "A number of elephants previously captured in the Kruger National Park developed a pink frothy discharge from the external nares. Some of these elephants subsequently died and histopathological examinations indicated severe lung oedema. In view of the current hypothesis that high blood pressure could be a causative factor, arterial blood pressure was measured in elephants immobilized with etorphine alone (n = 71) and with etorphine / azaperone (n = 109) and carfentanil / azaperone (n = 26) mixtures. Arterial blood pressure was found to be significantly lower in the groups immobilized with azaperone mixtures than in the group immobilized with etorphine alone (p < 0,05). In addition, no cases of lung oedema were observed in animals immobilized with etorphine / azaperone and carfentanil / azaperone mixtures. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that azaperone be added to immobilization mixtures when elephants are subjected to herding prior to darting.\n'n Aantal olifante wat voorheen in die Nasionale Krugerwildtuin gevang is, het 'n pienk, skuimerige neusuitskeiding ontwikkel. Sommige van hulle het later gevrek en histopatologiese ondersoek het erge longedeem bevestig. Volgens die hipotese dat hoe bloeddruk hiertoe aanleiding kon gegee het, is arteriele bloeddruk gemeet in olifante wat slegs met etorfien (n = 71) of met die mengsels etorfien / asaperoon (n = 109) en karfentaniel / asaperoon (n = 26) geimmobiliseer is. Arteriele bloeddruk van die groepe van met die asaperoonmengsels geimmobiliseer is, was betekenisvol laer as by die groep wat slegs met etorfien geimmobiliseer is (p < 0,05). Verder is geen longedeem waargeneem by die olifante wat met die mengsels geimmobiliseer is nie. Die toevoeging van asaperoon by die immobilisasiemengsel word dus sterk aanbeveel waar olifante eers aangekeer en dan gepyl word.",

Annual mortality of Acacia tortilisl/Ig ranged from \n9-37%, lagging utilization by elephants by 2-3 years, and decreased once tree density had declined. \nElephants ceased to use lIgAcacial/Ig Woodland once density had declined to that corresponding \nwith the less used A. tortilisl/Ig in Riparian Woodland.

We used occupancy models and interviews to evaluate site use by medium and large carnivores within the rural Meibae Community Conservancy and agriculturally-developed Salama areas of Kenya. We conducted monthly surveys for 4 months along 32 transects covering 160 km in both study areas, and collected detection/non-detection data for nine carnivore species (>10 kg) via direct sighting, tracks and scat. We modelled carnivore site use against both anthropogenic and environmental variables while accounting for imperfect detection, and conducted interviews to determine presence of conflict carnivores. Black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) site use was most strongly associated with higher livestock abundance. Rare or wider-ranging species were seldom (e.g. cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus) or never (e.g. African lion, Panthera leo) detected on transect surveys but were reported during interviews. We conclude that transect surveys were unreliable for evaluating presence of less common species in our study areas. While interviews were more effective, we recommend that future interviews should account for potential false-positive detections. We make suggestions for improving surveys and recommend combining methods to quantify site use by wide-ranging and cryptic carnivores.",

The camera trapping survey was carried out from 23 October to 5 December 2009, covered an area of 200 km2 and was initially intended to estimate the population density of leopards (Panthera pardus). The study area was split into two contiguous subsections, with each section sampled for a total of 20 days using 20 cameras. Camera trap photographs were identified to species level, then compared to a list of species thought to occur in the area according to available literature, as well as sightings from professional hunters and local landowners. Twenty-seven out of 38 medium-sized and large mammals thought to occur in the area were photographed. After 26 survey days (day six in section two), all ungulate species present in the area were photographed. However, the more elusive and less common carnivore species were not all recorded during the study. Both spotted (Crocuta crocuta) and brown hyaenas (Parahyaena brunnea) were once thought to be locally extinct or transient in the area but our results demonstrate that they may now be resident. Species inventories are useful to record species presence, particularly in data-poor areas where limited information exists. In areas where trophy hunting and poaching are high, like the Mangwe District, such information is critical to carefully monitor populations and allow for assessment of future management interventions.",

Our study aimed to determine the carcass characteristics, meat yields and offal contributions of fallow deer harvested in South Africa, as well as the effect of sex thereupon. Slaughter weights, warm carcass weights and cold carcass weights were higher in male (n = 8) fallow deer versus females (n = 14), and in pregnant females (n = 5) compared to non-pregnant females (n = 9). Similarly, dressing percentages were higher in males (62%) than females (59%), but were comparable to, or surpassed, those of other African game species and domestic livestock. Consumable offal (excluding stomach and intestines) contributed 10% and 9% to the slaughter weights of males and females, respectively, with some significant sex and pregnancy effects on certain offal components. The individual weights of seven muscles (longissimus thoracis et lumborum, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, psoas major ) did not differ between males and females. However, male fallow deer had significantly higher total meat and bone weights than females even though no differences were observed for the meat-to-bone ratios between males and females. These baseline data should provide the impetus for increased utilization of fallow deer by the South African game meat industry and strengthen the contribution of these animals to domestic food security.",

This study investigates the influence of weather on the time of arrival and the number of Namaqua sandgrouse at watering sites, the relationships between hunting effort, hunter efficiency and hunter satisfaction, and the impact of hunting at watering sites. There is a 9% drop in sandgrouse numbers and a six minute delay in arrival time at the watering site with every 25% increase in cloud cover. Hunter group size was not significantly correlated with hunter satisfaction. However, hunter efficiency was significantly negatively correlated and hunter satisfaction was significantly positively correlated with the number of birds counted during the hunt. Therefore, mean bag per hunter can be used as a reliable estimate of population size. The mean offtake per watering site per season was significantly positively correlated with the number of hunts at the watering site. We recommend that hunter group size should be at least 16, but that, given the apparently low reproductive levels of Namaqua sandgrouse, the number of hunts at a particular watering site in a season should preferably be limited to one hunt.\n'n Kommersiele jag industrie, gebaseer op die Namaqua sandpatrys Pterocles namaqua is in wording in die noordelike Kaapprovinsie, Suid Afrika. Alhoewel hierdie embrionale industrie die landbou ondersteun in hierdie semi-ariede omgewing wat geneig is tot woestynvorming, word die volle kommersiele waarde van hierdie hulpbron onderskat en word die hulpbron opsigself onderbenut. Hierdie studie ondersoek die invloed van weersomstandighede op aankomstye en getalle sandpatryse by waterplekke, en maatstawwe van jag poging, jagter effektiwiteit, jagter satisfaksie en die impak van jag by waterplekke. Daar is 'n 9% daling in die sandpatrys getalle en 'n ses minute vertraging in die aankomstyd by die waterplek met elke 25% toename in die wolkbedekking. Jagtergroepgroottes was nie beduidend gekorreleer met jagter satisfaksie nie, maar jagter effektiwiteit was beduidend negetief gekorreleer en jagter satisfaksie beduidend positief gekorreleer met die aantal voels getel gedurende die jag. Gevolglik kan die gemiddelde getal voels gedood per jagter gebruik word as 'n betroubare skatting van bevolkingsgrootte. Die gemiddelde getal voels verwyder per waterplek per seisoen was beduidend positief gekorreleer met die getal jaggeleenthede per waterplek. Ons beveel aan dat jagtergroepgroottes ten minste 16 moet wees, maar met die inagneming van die oenskynlike lae voorplantingsvlakke van die Namaqua sandpatrys, die getal jagte per waterplek per seisoen liefs beperk moet word tot slegs een.",

Pups comprised >27% of the samples after a synchronous March - April 1992 birth event in which about 50% of the adult females participated. The timing and frequency of parturition in the two species are in response to a unimodal temporal distribution of rainfall with a historical peak from December to January. Births coincided with a heavy March rainfall after and before extended periods without rain. Litter size seemed little affected by the drought. Sixteen of 19 nurseries were communal, and six (37,5%) of these, heterospecific. Reproductive individuals may conserve energy as the effectiveness of vigilance increases with group size, especially for heterospecific groups. Extreme predation pressure in the MNP may be a selective agent favouring synchronous parturition and cooperative behaviour by the two species of hyrax.\nDie demografie van sintopiese bevolkings van Procavia capensis (klipdassies) en Heterohyrax brucei (geelkol dassies) is vanaf Oktober 1991 tot Mei 1992 gedurende 'n droogte in die Matobo Nasionale Park in Zimbabwe ondersoek. Kleintjies het >27% van die groepe uitgemaak wat na die geboorte seisoen van Maart tot April 1992 getel is en waaraan ongeveer 50% van die volwasse wyfies deelgeneem het. Die tydsbepaling en frekwensie van geboorte in die twee spesies is oenskynlik as gevolg van die historiese reenval verspreiding met enkel 'n piek in Desember en Januarie. Geboortes het saamgeval met swaar reens in Maart na 'n lang tyd sonder reen. Werpselgrootte is oenskynlik nie veel deur die droogte beinvloed nie. Sestien van die negentien groepe met kleintjies het uit verskeie individue bestaan, terwyl ses groepe (37,5%) uit beide spesies bestaan het. Wyfies met kleintjies kan waarskynlik energie bespaar in groepe waar oplettenheid meer effektief is, die voordeel word verhoog in gemengde spesiegroepe. Sterk predasiedruk in die nasionale park is moontlik 'n faktor wat seleksie tengunste van gesinkroniseerde geboorte en kooperatiewe gedrag, tussen die twee spesies, bevorder.",

Terrestrial vascular plants were considered to be the group of wild alien species posing the greatest threat to indigenous biodiversity. Despite there being a broad range of specialized taxonomic knowledge amongst the scientists, relatively few of them have contributed to the compilation of species lists for nature reserves, or have published research reports dealing with aspects of biodiversity. The components of conservation biology for which the respondents felt most in need of additional training were geographic information systems, mathematical modelling, minimum viable populations, time-series analysis and decision analysis. The respondents also expressed a greater need need for further training in socio-economic influences and environmental impact assessments than for other options.\nTweehonderd professionele natuurwetenskaplikes (diegene met biologiese grade) in diens van amptelike natuurbewaringsinstansies (148 persone) en natuurhistoriese museums (52 persone) in Suid-Afrika het deel uitgemaak van 'n meningsopname m.b.t. sake wat die beskerming van biologiese diversiteit (= biodiversiteit) beinvloed.

The jackals tended to be present at the colony in larger numbers, and for longer periods, outside the seal pupping season than during it. During pupping seal placentas and dead pups are abundant. Outside the pupping season food may be more difficult for jackals to obtain and hence they are more diurnally active within the colony. An estimated 1 770 pups were killed or scavenged annually by jackals, i.e. 35.7% of the pups born at the colony. All jackal-kills observed were of seal pups.

At Oribi Airport (Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal), there is a higher incidence of bird strikes relative to other South African airports. Hadeda ibis (Bostrychia hagedash) and crowned plovers (Vanellus coronatus) are responsible for most bird strikes at Oribi Airport. During winter, the \nhadeda ibis was the \nmost frequently seen bird (per hour) and used a predictable daily flight route beginning with movement to feeding grounds (SE-NW) around sunrise and returning (NW-SE) to a roosting site around sunset. Time of movement, with respect to season, varied according to sunrise or sunset flight time, i.e. in summer they moved earlier and returned later and vice versa. These bird flight patterns increased the \nprobability of a strike with departing or arriving aircraft. During summer, there was a decrease in presence and use of Oribi Airport as a feeding ground for the \nhadeda ibis. Although the \nnumber of birds at the \nairport, particularly raptors, increased during the \nsummer, few were present at any time.

The clinical symptoms displayed by sick birds were identical to those descriptionbed for avian botulism. As no traces of Clostridium botulinum could be detected, redbilled teal Anas erythrorhyncha were exposed to T. cooperi parasitism in the laboratory to establish whether this leech could have been responsible for the death of the birds in the field. Similar symptoms were induced which, in several cases, terminated in the death of test birds. Autopsy invariably revealed nasal chambers packed with leeches, which corresponded to the findings for dead birds found in the field. Although it has been demonstrated that T. cooperi was the causative agent of mortality, the precise mechanism whereby death is induced still remains to be investigated. It appears, however, that death was brought about by the simultaneous action of a complex of factors, inter alia excretions of the leeches, dehydration, loss of blood, stress and impeded respiration.",

    "abstract": "The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has long been regarded as a significant threat to the interests of farmers of both game and livestock in Namibia and for this reason has been removed in large numbers. However, the diet of these cheetahs has not been documented; such documentation is an important component of any effective conservation plan. We performed feeding trials to relate more accurately the remains found in cheetah scats to the number of prey animals consumed. Using scat analysis techniques, we found that cheetah prey size ranged from birds and hares to large antelope. They rarely preyed on domestic stock, with apparent selection towards common, indigenous game species. Information gathered from \naerial sightings of kills was significantly biased towards larger prey species. Data on the number of times cheetahs were seen near livestock or game were found to not be representative of the type of prey taken when compared to corrected scat analysis. Due to the diurnal nature and wide-ranging habits of cheetahs, they are sighted relatively frequently near stock, which may contribute to an exaggerated perception of their predation on stock. From the results of this study, livestock predation by cheetahs was estimated to account for at least 0.01 calves and 0.004 sheep per kmlsupg2l/supg on the Namibian farmlands, and may be substantially \nmore depending on cheetah density. Any stock losses as a result of cheetahs and \nother predators can have economic impacts for farmers, and management techniques for mitigating such losses are suggested. The use of controlled feeding trials and subsequent calculation of a correction factor for scat analysis could be a valuable tool for gaining a more accurate estimate of carnivore diet in future studies.",

Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this decline, with food limitation as the most likely ultimate cause. Pubescent male southern elephant seals have relatively high energetic requirements as a result of large body size and a secondary growth spurt, and we expect their vital rates to be strongly influenced by food availability. Here we estimate survival in pubescent males for the period 1987-1999 and use temporal changes in these estimates as a proxy measure of their prey availability. We also compare survival during and after the population decline to further our understanding of the demographics of the southern elephant seal population at Marion Island. We found a recent significant increase of between 4.4 and 6.3% in pubescent male survival concurrent with the stabilization of the population at Marion Island.

    "abstract": "The evolution of the tourism sector has been subjected to massive changes in demand and technology, as well as increasing competition amongst destinations to such a degree that product diversification is now core to development strategies in order to maintain competitiveness and remain abreast of contemporary trends. The study sought to determine the demand for ecotourism products in view of developing a diversification strategy. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect demand-side data at Maun and Kasane airports; these data were then analysed quantitatively. Findings revealed a strong preference for wildlife/wilderness and nature products, whereas events and hunting were least liked. The country attracts mature tourists who prefer soft adventure and activities that prioritize conservation, interpretation, and environmental education. Factors related to entertainment, the construction of entertainment facilities, a post office, and golf courses were strongly resented. It was established that related diversification, focused on expanding services and enhancing existing products, is the most appropriate strategy. Practically, the research offers a specific diversification strategy based on ecotourism, detailing how and what to diversify. The study makes a valuable contribution to demand-side diversification literature as well as empirical research, which is lacking in Botswana.",

    "abstract": "Globally, anthropogenic land conversion has resulted in reduced natural land available for free-roaming wildlife, and a shift in species composition. Certain mesocarnivores exhibit an ability to adapt and expand distribution ranges under differing anthropogenic pressures. Our study addressed the socio-ecological attitudes and general perspectives towards mammalian mesocarnivores across a land-use gradient (rural–urban) from the uMgungundlovu to eThekwini municipalities of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We determined threats, conflicts and attitudes towards mammalian mesocarnivores using an online questionnaire survey. The public held a range of opinions on mesocarnivores. Participants from both land-use types generally regarded mesocarnivores as non-threatening and vital for the environment. However, not all mesocarnivores were regarded with equal benevolence. Black-backed jackals, Canis mesomelas, were consistently singled out as a problematic species by rural inhabitants and this intensified reactions when a confrontation occurred. Smaller and more behaviourally flexible mesocarnivores (mongoose spp. and Cape genets, Genetta tigrina) were the most observed species in both land-use types, indicating potential population increases. Vehicle collision was the leading cause of mesocarnivore fatalities. Overall, perceived impacts and threats of mesocarnivores differed across the land-use gradients. Our study illustrates the importance of citizen science and community engagement across a land-use gradient in wildlife conservation efforts.",

To better understand adaptations of the African waterfowl, we measured how body masses of Spur-winged Goose (Plectropterus gambensis),South African Shelduck (Tadorna cana), Yellow-billed Duck (Anas undulata), Red-billed Teal (Anas erythrorhyncha) and Southern Pochard (Netta erythrophthalma) change during flight-feather moult. We further assessed how pectoral muscle size of Spur-winged Goose and South African Shelduck varied during the same period of flight-feather moult. Our results indicate that Spur-winged Goose and South African Shelduck underwent atrophy and subsequent regeneration of the pectoral muscles, while their body mass decreased at the onset of moult and later stabilized from the time when flight feathers were two-thirds grown until moult was completed. Body mass of Yellow-billed Duck and Red-billed Teal decreased from the onset of moult until the mid-point but thereafter increased rapidly, returning to pre-moult levels by the time moult was completed. Southern Pochard gradually lost mass from the start of moult almost until moult completion, at which time mass increased slightly.We conclude that African waterfowl exhibit different fluctuations in body mass and pectoral muscle size during flight-feather moult. Taken together, these findings suggest that no single hypothesis can fully explain the interspecific differences in the moult strategies of African waterfowl as reflected in changes in body and pectoral muscle conditions.",

Repeated observations are sometimes necessary, but may distress and displace animals. Information from more remote observations using radio-triangulation is limited and includes larger measurement errors. We investigated the influence of observer visits on average daily displacement by 14 black rhinos in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, and the accuracy of triangulated locations with increasing observer distance and the time to complete bearing sets. Fortnightly observer visits for 34 months that often disturbed rhino (52% of visits) had an insignificant impact on daily movements. However, increasing observer distance from rhino, and the time taken to triangulate, were both significant explanations of rhino location error. We recommend that measures to quantify and minimize observer influence become standard monitoring protocol and that bearings for radio-triangulation of black rhino locations occur from <1 km (not >2 km), and be completed within 30 minutes. Reporting measures for spatial error and observer influence permit the development of objective thresholds for data inclusion to improve radio-telemetry data and inter-study comparisons of black rhino range studies.",

Monitoring species via their tracks is controversial due to unreliable recording techniques, manipulator bias and substrate variation. Furthermore, subjective identification of the foot that produces each track can lead to significant errors, for example, when assigning tracks made by different feet from the same individual to different individuals. The aim of this research was to develop an accurate, consistent and objective algorithm to identify the anteroposterior (hind/front) and mediolateral (right/left) position from digital threedimensional (3D) models of African lion (Panthera leo) paws and tracks using geometric morphometrics. We manually positioned 12 fixed landmarks on 132 paws and 182 tracks recorded in 3D using digital close-range photogrammetry. We used geometric morphometrics to evaluate and visualize the shape variation between paws and between tracks along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes, and between paws and tracks. The identification algorithm using linear discriminant analysis with jack-knifed predictions reached a maximum accuracy of 95.45% and 91.21% for paws and tracks, respectively. We recommend the use of this objective position identification algorithm in future studies where tracks are compared between individual African lions.",

Here we investigate the effectiveness of six different methods to deter primates from crop foraging on commercial farms in South Africa. Model snakes and bioacoustic sounds had no effect on chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). A leopard model and the sound of bees reduced the foraging duration at bait stations of vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and baboons, respectively. Human sounds appeared to reduce the number of days baboons visited a bait station, but not their foraging duration. Only an electric fence was effective at keeping both baboons and vervets out of a crop field. We encourage modifications to electric fence designs to avoid electrocution of smaller animals and make recommendations for other deterrent methods that require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Like many anthropogenic linear structures, fences are ubiquitous across South Africa and increasingly in the rest of Africa. Fences play a key role in conservation and livelihoods, including inter alia demarcating protected areas, safeguarding vulnerable populations of threatened species, and facilitating food security through the management of livestock and mitigating livestock predation from native predators. However, fences also have several deleterious effects, including curtailing historical animal migration routes, denying animals access to seasonally important resources, and providing a physical barrier on which animals can become entangled or electrocuted. Despite these negative effects being commonly known, few African studies have quantified the threat specifically posed by electrified fences, although several studies have highlighted the risks posed by unelectrified fences. This study investigated vertebrate interactions along 108 km of electrified fencing on a private game farm over nearly five years and analysed the effect of several predictive variables on the outcome of interactions with fencing. Overall, 43 vertebrate species were recorded interacting with the fencing on 782 occasions, resulting in 213 fatal interactions. Medium-sized mammals, specifically steenbok (Raphicerus campestris ) and Temminck's pangolin (Smutsia temminckii ), and large reptiles including rock monitor (Varanus albigularis ) and serrated tent tortoise (Psammobates oculifer ) were particularly prone to fatal interactions. Body size, season and defensive behaviour were the best predictors of a species' tendency for fatal interactions with electrified fencing. This study records several additional species that have not previously been recorded interacting with electrified fencing, and for the first time highlights the potentially large, albeit possibly local, negative effect that electrified fencing has on the rock monitor.",

    "abstract": "Rewilding is a conservation strategy used to restore ecosystems to previous states and can involve the reintroduction of large carnivores into areas from where they had been previously extirpated. Whilst rewilding has been important for ecosystem functioning, it can have negative implications for naïve prey that have had no exposure to the presence of large carnivores. Therefore, understanding prey responses to the reintroduction of predators is crucial for management and conservation. We assessed the effects of reintroduced cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) on the vigilance of two species of naïve prey: the steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) and the springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). We hypothesized that both species would increase their vigilance behaviour post-cheetah reintroduction, but that the steenbok would demonstrate a greater response due to their smaller body size and more solitary nature. To test this, we compared the vigilance of both species before and after the reintroduction of cheetahs. Both species increased vigilance within one year post-cheetah reintroduction, but the steenbok demonstrated a much stronger response with a ˜70% increase in the percentage of time spent vigilant post-cheetah reintroduction. Springbok levels of vigilance were lower (˜50% increase), which we suggest is a function of body-size and/or grouping behaviour. Importantly, we show that naïve prey species are able to exhibit a rapid response to the reintroduction of large carnivores. However, the variation in responses highlights the importance of species-level monitoring after large carnivore reintroductions.",

Recommendations are made concerning the appropriateness of the timing of the hunting seasons. Of 8 288 breeding records available from the three regions (Eastern Cape = 1 919, Western Cape = 5942, Northern Cape 427), 90% were for the Egyptian goose Alopochen aegyptiacus (n = 2 524), yellowbilled duck Anas undulata (n = 1 607), Cape shoveller Anas smithii (n = 1 520), Cape teal Anas capensis (n = 1 053) and South African shelduck Tadorna cana (n = 704). The remaining seven species contributed only 10% of the records. It is apparent that most species are reproductively most active during late winter and spring in the Western Cape, a winter rainfall region, and during the summer in the summer rainfall region. We suggest that the periods of least breeding activity for the majority of ducks in the Cape provinces are from late summer to mid-winter (1 January-30 June) in the winter rainfall region (Western Cape) and from autumn to late winter (15 April-15 July) in the summer rainfall regions (Eastern and Northern Cape).\nTeelpatrone, in tyd en ruimte, van 12 eendspesies in die Kaapprovinsie, Suid-Afrika, is met die huidige geproklameerde jagseisoene vir die spesies vergelyk. Aanbevelings word met betrekking tot die geskiktheid van die jagseisoene gemaak. Van die 8 288 teelrekords wat vir die drie provinsies beskikbaar is (Oos-Kaap = 1 919, Wes-Kaap = 5 942, Noord-Kaap = 427), was 90% die van die kolgans Alopochen aegyptiacus (n = 2524), geelbekeend Anas undulata (n = 1 607), Kaapse slopeend Anas smithii (n = 1 520), teeleend Anas capensis (n = 1 053) en die kopereend Tadorna cana (n = 704). Die oorblywende sewe spesies het slegs 10% tot die rekords bygedra. Dit is duidelik dat die meeste van die spesies met betrekking tot voortplanting die aktiefste is gedurende die laat winter en lente in die Wes-Kaap, wat 'n winterreenvalstreek is, en gedurende die somer in die somerreenvalstreke. Ons stel voor dat die periodes met die minste teelaktiwiteit vir die meerderheid eende in die Kaapprovinsies tydens die laat somer tot middel-winter (1 Januarie-30 Junie) in die winterreenvalstreek is (Wes-Kaap) en gedurende die herfs tot laat winter (15 April-15 Julie) in die somerreenvalstreke (Oos- en Noord-Kaap).",

Seasonal variation in the use of grass species was evident. Oribi select grass species that decline in abundance in the veld when it deteriorates in condition, and therefore, for optimal oribi management, the veld should contain a high proportion of these decreaser grasses.\nDie dieet van the oorbietjie is bepaal deur fekale analise op twee plase in Natal.

Age-selective harvesting does not increase production, but care must be taken not to avoid harvesting younger animals as this reduces the maximum sustainable yield. Although the use of periodic harvesting strategies does not increase production its applicability in rangeland management is worthy of further investigation. Four strategies, using different combinations of periodic and sex-selective harvesting, are examined in terms of production and managerial input.\nDie effek van verskillende oes-strategiee op die maksimaal volhoubare produksie van 'n rooibok Aepyceros melampus bevolking is met behulp van 'n rekenaarsimulasiemodel bepaal.

The larger abundant antelopes predominated in the diet and their occurrence in the diet was apparently directly related to the availability of the prey within the hyaena foraging areas. In Mkuzi Game Reserve and the Namib Naukluft National Park, hyaenas coexist with only one other large predator. In Umfolozi Game Reserve, where hyaenas coexist with four other large predators, a greater variety of prey was taken. Scat weight in desert-dwelling hyaenas was twice that of those from more mesic areas, which may be an adaptation to restricted water intake. The incidence of domestic livestock in the diet was meagre, probably the result of collecting scats only from latrines within the game reserves.\nDie spesies-samestelling van prooi verbruik deur gevlekte hienas Crocuta crocuta in drie verskillende gebiede in Suidelike Afrika is bepaal deur faeces-analise. Die groter meer volop wildsbokke het die dieet gedomineer en die voorkoms in dieet toon 'n direkte verwantskap met beskikbaarheid van prooi in hiena-jaggebiede. Hienas deel Mkuzi Wildtuin en die Namib Naukluft Nasionale Park met slegs een ander groot roofdier terwyl vier ander groot roofdiere Umfolozi Wildtuin met hienas deel, wat lei tot groter variasie in prooi-items.

The seasonal pattern of food types eaten and the mean crop volume of 19.7 ml are similar to those recorded for helmeted guineafowl elsewhere, in natural habitats. Of the 24 crops collected, 13 contained invertebrates. Seed bugs (Family: Lygaeidae), tenebrionid larvae (Family: Tenebrionidae) and grasshoppers (Family: Acrididae) were common in the crops during autumn, while weevils (Family: Curculionidae), nitidulids (Family: Nitidulidae) and noctuid larvae (Family: Noctuidae) were commonest in crops collected during summer. The presence of fruits in the diet, namely apples and grapes, during late summer and early autumn, and late autumn and early winter, respectively, is of concern. However, the possibility of these fruits, particularly the apples, being eaten from fallen fruit is not refuted.",

Nevertheless, both groups believe that environmental conservation should be receiving greater funding from the state, particularly at the expense of defence spending, the costs of 'apartheid', and perceived bureaucratic excesses. The overriding impression from these results is that both professional ecologists and business leaders agree that the key issues facing environmental conservation are of a social, economic and political nature.

This pattern of molar wear in nyala, although following a negative exponential curve similar to that in impala Aepyceros melampus, zebra Equus burchelli boehm; and Grant's gazelle Gazella granti does not enable the allocation of ages to be made as clearly as in these species.

Agreement between ages determined from cementum annuli and those determined by wear age was 51% in the case of males and 46% in females. If a range of i?½ one year is considered acceptable, the agreement is 87% in males and 67% in females. It was necessary to refer to both wear and cementum annuli to establish the age of an animal as split opaque annuli made precise counting difficult.

We examined the effect of translocation on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels of an African elephant family group, which was translocated within the Kruger National Park, South Africa.

Little information exists on the chemical composition of buffalo meat or the effect that sex and muscle type may have thereupon. In the present investigation, eight male and four female buffalo that were found to be positive for tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) were culled and the chemical composition of their meat determined. Although male buffalo meat had higher moisture and protein than females, these differences were small and it is debatable whether a consumer would notice such differences. The amount of fat (<2 g/100g) and ash did not differ between sexes. Similarly, the differences in the proximate composition of the Biceps femoris, Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus muscles were all also <1 g/100 g meat. Sex had no effect on the amino acid composition of the muscles but alanine, valine and histidine content differed between muscle types although the differences were <1 g/100 g protein. The fatty acid (FA) composition did not differ between sexes or muscle type. Oleic acid was the dominant FA followed by linoleic and palmitic acids. The FA had similar ratios of saturated FA (∼38%), mono-unsaturated FA (∼31%) and poly-unsaturated FA (∼29%). The low fat to protein ratio and a poly-unsaturated to saturated FA ratio of >0.7 indicates that buffalo meat is a lean, healthy and condensed protein source.",

People's perceptions and attitudes were analysed using multinomial logistic regression. Top model ranking showed that the distance from protected area, livelihood source, and extent of livestock killed by spotted hyaenas had an influence on the perceptions of villagers about the species. Furthermore, it was noted that incentives may play a pivotal role in moderating the human–spotted hyaena conflict.

As continuous forests become increasingly limited, it is important to determine conservation and biodiversity values of intact forests and surrounding landscapes. Currently, there is little data on how anuran communities react to the alarming growth of habitat degradation in tropical East Africa, nor on the value of remnant forests. This study evaluated the alpha, beta and gamma diversity of frogs in an altered landscape on Mount Mulanje, Malawi, East Africa, and assessed the impact of habitat degradation and diversity of a landscape matrix of various habitat types. Nine sites were sampled: three intact miombo forests, three eucalyptus plantations, and three secondary forests. Twenty-nine species were found throughout these landscapes. Intact miombo forests contained significantly more frog species than the other habitats. The degree of canopy cover and area size appeared to determine species diversity across all three landscapes. Although eucalyptus plantations were impoverished, naturally regenerating secondary forests can help relieve the effects of habitat alteration. Nevertheless, degraded habitats cannot substitute for continuous blocks of forest; therefore understanding these differences is crucial for maintaining the biodiversity value in the long term.",

Aspects of the spatial and temporal variation in lion diet were investigated in the southwestern Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP) between May 2013 and June 2015 using evidence of prey remains identified through GPS cluster analysis (n = 278) and lion scat analysis (n = 189). Spatial variation in diet was investigated between three regional landscape types (north, south and west), based on the different vegetation types represented within each area, and two terrain types (riverbeds and dunes). Seasonal variations were assessed according to the hot-wet season (November to April), and cold-dry season (May to October). Lion diet profiles varied between landscape types and terrain type, but not seasonally. The most notable spatial differences in lion diet profiles were between the dune and riverbed terrains. Blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, contributed significantly to lion diet in the riverbeds (36%), but not in the dunes (2%). Gemsbok, Oryx gazella, was the primary contributor to lion intake biomass across all seasons, landscape types, as well as in the dune terrain (range 55–82%). Being largely independent of surface water and the most widespread and abundant of the large prey species, gemsbok are expected to remain the primary food source for lions and are likely to be a key driver of lion population dynamics in the KTP.",

However, presence data on most carnivore species (e.g. cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus) are not readily available to assist conservation efforts. In this study, we used MaxEnt to tease out the key determinants of the spatial distribution of cheetahs using presence-only data of cheetah against five environmental variables, i.e. distance to water (a proxy for prey density), elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness, and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI; a proxy for vegetation quality and condition). Our MaxEnt model was successful (AUC = 0.98) in predicting the potential distribution of cheetahs in Gonarezhou National Park. We observed that amongst the five environmental variables, elevation and distance to water contributed most (88%) to the potential distribution of cheetahs. The contribution of SAVI, slope and terrain ruggedness (12%) was negligible. We also estimated that the potential predicted habitat of cheetahs was 2572.9 km2 (51.2% of Gonarezhou National Park). In addition to providing baseline information, these findings are both novel and specific to Gonarezhou National Park, and provide important insights into cheetah conservation and management.",

Several interventions aim to curb the effects of poaching and achieve black rhino conservation targets in the short to medium term.

    "abstract": "Molecular genetic techniques were used to determine the identity of two catfish individuals that could not be identified as indigenous Clarias gariepinus after phenotypic analysis. The unidentified catfish were compared to 126 reference samples, using sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region. The reference dataset included African catfish from South Africa and Kenya, as well as GenBank records for this species and for three species of Southeast Asian catfish, including the potentially invasive walking catfish, C. batrachus. Visual inspection of sequences showed parallel polymorphisms in the unidentified catfish and C. batrachus that did not occur in C. gariepinus. A bioinformatics approach using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information confirmed that the unidentified catfish show more similarity to catfish of Asian origin compared to C. gariepinus. Finally, a phylogenetic approach showed that the catfish analysed group according to continent of origin (Africa and Asia) with strong bootstrap support, and with the unidentified fish contained in the Asian cluster.We conclude that the unidentified catfish are most likely imported C. batrachus.",

    "abstract": "Lion (Panthera leo) populations on small reserves (<1000 km2) require more intensive management than those in larger conservation areas. 'Surplus' animals are a major management concern, resulting from smaller inter-birth intervals, younger ages of first reproduction and higher survival rates. In the 1990s and early 2000s, this surplus was translocated to newly formed reserves. More recently, the proliferation of new reserves has slowed, often forcing managers to cull surplus animals. The Lion Management Forum has proposed several interventions to reduce the number of surplus lions by mimicking natural processes. These include the use of chemical contraception to increase the age of first reproduction and/or inter-birth intervals to match those found in the Kruger National Park (NP) lions; or 'tube-tying' to reduce litter size to match that found in the Serengeti NP. We developed a population simulation model, GrowLS, to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. GrowLS predicts that alterations to inter-birth intervals or litter size would achieve the largest reduction in surplus animals. Alterations to the age of first reproduction in lionesses had almost no effect. A combined approach would result in an undesirable near-zero population growth. Additional features of GrowLS are its ability to predict population size and the number of breeding lionesses and cubs per year. GrowLS has applications in the management of other species for which the required input parameters are known. GrowLS will serve as an invaluable tool for managers wanting to control population size by manipulating female reproductive rates.",

The competitive management system resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of wildlife at seven sites where the system had been in operation for 4 years (2004 - 2008). We examined the relationships between wildlife-based tourism and park management, and key factors that may influence tourism. First, we scrutinized the relationship between the relative abundance of illegal activity and numbers of visitors, the relative abundance of wildlife, and road network. Poaching declined with increasing numbers of tourists that acted as a deterrent, whereas poaching increased with a higher relative abundance of wildlife. Second, we examined the relationship between the numbers of visitors and the relative abundance of wildlife, species richness, distances from Accra, regional capitals and the nearest hotel; the road network on site, and the numbers of alternative tourist attractions. Increasing numbers of alternative tourist attractions, and shorter distances to the nearest hotel attracted higher numbers of visitors. An important additional factor that influenced the flow of tourists to protected areas was the presence of unique site attractions.",

Adults and juveniles were collected on a naturally occurring pan (Yengweni Pan) and a large water storage dam (Pongolapoort Dam) during early winter (June), late winter (August) and spring (October). While the proportions of individual foods varied throughout the winter and spring and between the two collection sites, there were no sex or age-related dietary differences at either of the sites (P > 0.05). The seeds of moist soil (g 99% aggregate dry mass) and aquatic plants (g 97%) were the principal dietary items of birds using the Pongolapoort Dam and Yengweni Pan, respectively. While extensive submerged plant communities permit birds to consume large quantities of aquatic seeds on the Yengweni Pan, large fluctuations in water level on the Pongolapoort Dam impede aquatic plant establishment, forcing birds to forage elsewhere. The most commonly consumed seeds contained fat and crude protein levels ranging between 0.82-1.60 and 7.00-12.69%, respectively. Invertebrates were minor dietary items (<, 1.0%) and although birds tended to consume higher levels of animal matter during the wing-molting period, invertebrate consumption was not correlated with molt intensity. Continued drainage and overgrazing of shallow pans and damming of floodplain systems will adversely affect the aquatic foods used by wintering white-faced whistling ducks, particularly during wing-feather molt. The consequences of large-scale water abstraction schemes and wetland drainage may be even more severe for diving ducks, as they are incapable of foraging in terrestrial habitats.",

During the wet season deciduous plants of the savanna flats are preferred, but in the dry season the animals concentrate on evergreen plants in the more densely vegetated koppies. Seasonal variation with respect to the number of plant species utilized, the intake of woody plant material and the frequency of aberrant behaviour patterns associated with feeding, also occur. Seasonal peaks in reproduction and daily rest periods are apparently influenced by energy requirements and the availability of preferred food species.

    "abstract": "Camera-trap surveys, when combined with capture-recapture models, are an accurate and cost-effective method for estimating the abundance of individually identifiable carnivore species such as leopards, Panthera pardus. Reliable population estimates for leopards are particularly useful as they enable informed conservation and management decisions for a species that, although widespread, is heavily persecuted. Here we present the results of a camera-trap survey that estimated the population density of leopards in Zululand Rhino Reserve (ZRR) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We divided our study area in half and subsampled each section for 40 days using 34 paired camera-trap stations. The combined data yielded captures of six individual leopards (3 male, 3 female) photographed on 19 occasions. Using the program CAPTURE, population abundance was estimated according to two models; one that assumes homogeneous capture probabilities among individual leopards (Mo) and one that allows for heterogeneity in capture probabilities between individuals (Mh). For model Mo, the resultant capture probability was 0.317 and estimated abundance was 6 ± 0.390 (6-6, 95% CI). For model Mh, the resultant capture probability was 0.112 and estimated abundance was 17 ± 6.37 (10-37, 95% CI). The area effectively sampled by the camera-traps was 234 km2. Therefore, the estimated population density of leopards in the reserve was 2.5 ± 0.195 leopards per 100 km2 according to model Mo, and 7.00 ± 2.64 leopards per 100 km2 according to model Mh. When compared with the results of similar surveys conducted in nearby reserves, our findings suggest that the leopard population in the ZRR is below carrying capacity. To encourage population recovery, we recommend that no trophy hunting of leopards be conducted in the reserve, that measures be introduced to reduce retaliatory killing of leopards by livestock owners in surrounding areas, and that the illegal trade in leopard skins be addressed.",

Two trials were carried out: one in which the animals were caught by being chased into a net (Method 1) and the other in which capture was achieved using a drop-net system (Method 2). Method 1 resulted in significantly increased concentrations of the blood variables lactate, glucose, cortisol, osmolality and haematocrit. Method 2 produced significantly elevated levels of lactate, cortisol and osmolality. Concentrations of the variables measured were lower for the group caught by Method 2 than for those caught by Method 1, and in most cases this difference was significant (p < 0,05). It is suggested that Method 2 can be regarded as the more favourable technique in view of the smaller increase in blood variables measured, and a shorter capture and handling time for each capture session.\nTwee metodes word beskryf om rooibokke Aepyceros melampus in aanhouding te vang met die doel om hulle te weeg en om bloedmonsters te versamel.

    "abstract": "Population models using spreadsheet programmes on personal computers bring population modelling within reach of a greater range of wildlife managers than in the past. Limited mathematical expertise is required, and the model uses a step-by-step framework based on information obtained by field observation. The process is illustrated using parameters from a mountain reedbuck population on the Rolfontein Nature Reserve in the Great Karoo. It is essential that the model focuses on the changes that a population undergoes, and sensitivity analysis can be used to identify those parameters having the greatest effect on these changes. Removal of a substantial portion of the population increases the sensitivity of the model, and environmental effects on the population, such as rainfall fluctuations, can easily be incorporated. Some ideas for more advanced features, such as detailed age structure, density dependence, different management policies and stochastic events are briefly outlined. Whereas simple models have limited use in predicting population changes accurately, owing to oversimplification of complicated environmental effects, they have great potential to increase understanding of population processes, and to synthesize data of doubtful reliability in a meaningful way.\nBevolkingsmodelle wat sigbladprogramme op persoonlike rekenaars gebruik, bring bevolkingsmodellering binne bereik van meer natuurlewebestuurders as voorheen. Net beperkte wiskundige vermoe is nodig en die model gebruik 'n stap-vir-stap raamwerk gegrond op inligting verkry deur veldwaarneming. Die proses word geillustreer deur parameters van 'n rooiribbokbevolking op die Rolfontein Natuurreservaat in die Groot Karoo te gebruik. Dit is noodsaaklik dat die model klem le op die veranderings wat 'n bevolking ondergaan, en sensitiwiteitsontleding kan gebruik word om die parameters te bepaal wat die grootste uitwerking op hierdie veranderings het. Verwydering van 'n aansienlike gedeelte van die bevolking vermeerder die gevoeligheid van die model, en omgewingsinvloede op die bevolking, soos reenvalskommelinge, kan maklik geinkorporeer word. Idees vir meer gevorderde fasette, soos gedetailleerde ouderdomstrukture, digtheidsafhanklikheid, verskillende bestuursbeleide en stogastiese gebeurtenisse word kortliks uiteengesit. Terwyl eenvoudige modelle beperkte nut het om bevolkingsveranderings akkuraat te voorspel, weens oorvereenvoudiging van ingewikkelde omgewingsinvloede, le daar groot potensiaal in om bevolkingsprosesse beter te verstaan, en om data van twyfelagtige betroubaarheid op 'n betekenisvolle wyse saam te voeg.",

In the Makgadikgadi National Park, although zebras were the most important single food item, the composition of the diet varied according to the seasonal availability of food resources. There was no evidence to suggest that brown hyaenas hunted livestock, or any other significantly sized mammals, thus the persecution of them because of perceived livestock predation is unjustified. The dietary benefit derived by the brown hyaenas through the presence of subsistence pastoralists and their livestock carcasses, is likely to be the primary reason that brown hyaena populations in cattle areas appear to be viable.",

Monitoring the survival and habitat use of packs reintroduced into protected areas (PAs) is an essential part of adaptive management and improving the health and, ultimately, the survival of the metapopulation. Our study describes the territoriality and habitat selection of a pack of wild dogs reintroduced into Manyoni Private Game Reserve (219 km2) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Despite being introduced into a small PA, the pack only utilized half their available space (121 km2) and avoided the central areas of the reserve. Post hoc analysis of African lion (Panthera leo) localities suggested competitive avoidance was a strong factor in shaping the habitat usage of the pack; however, further research is required. Habitat selection also varied seasonally and with denning. Ultimately, we showed that spatio-temporal analyses can help identify high-risk areas within wild dog territories, such as hotspots of activity along fencelines. These analyses can then be used to increase targeted management of these areas, such as improving the maintenance of well-used fencelines, which is an important consideration for the sustained success of the metapopulation across small PAs.",

Our study was conducted between April and mid-July 2015 and used data collected over 105 days from 39 camera traps to quantify activity patterns of sympatric mesocarnivores in riparian and grassland habitats of Telperion Nature Reserve, South Africa. A total of 13 mesocarnivore species were detected within this relatively small (∼7350 ha) reserve. Sufficient records (≥10 records) were obtained for rusty-spotted genet (Genetta maculata), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), otter species (African clawless otter, Aonyx capensis, and spotted-necked otter, Hydrictis maculicollis), serval (Leptailurus serval ), slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus). Generalized linear models were used to investigate whether species ID, temperature, vegetation characteristics or moon phase best predicted temporal activity. To assess which species had the highest potential for competitive interaction, we also quantified the coefficient of activity overlap. Our results show that species ID and temperature were the best predictors of mesocarnivore activity. Slender and yellow mongooses displayed the highest coefficient of activity overlap (0.90), followed by marsh mongoose and rusty-spotted genet (0.80), and serval and rusty-spotted genet (0.79). These species are likely to have the highest potential for competitive interactions, but preferences for different vegetation characteristics and variations in the estimated relative abundance may point to coexistence through spatial and fine-scale temporal partitioning. The other species exhibited lower coefficients of activity overlap with each other, suggesting they may coexist through temporal partitioning of resources.",

    "abstract": "Africa's large predator guild (lion, Panthera leo; leopard, Panthera pardus; spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta; cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, and African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) occurs sympatrically with high dietary overlap. Temporal partitioning could facilitate coexistence, but there has been no study testing this or the factors that may influence the evolution of predator activity patterns. The activity patterns of Africa's large predators were reviewed, using published sources, and the degree of activity overlap was assessed. Six hypotheses were made based on three hypotheses of factors driving the evolution of predator activity patterns : increased foraging success,and scramble and interference competition. All predators exhibited a degree of crepuscular behaviour, supporting hypotheses relating to increased hunting success. Nocturnal predators exhibit decreased activity at the darkest times of night due to visual limitations. There was no support for the hypothesis that predators would be active at the same time as their main prey species. Although all members of the guild suffer intraguild predation, only subordinate members exhibited scramble competition avoidance by minimizing activity at the same times as their intraguild predators. Subordinate predators (wild dogs and cheetahs), frequently reported as suffering from kleptoparasitism, minimize simultaneous activity with major kleptoparasites (lions and spotted hyaenas). These latter top predators have high dietary overlap; however, they do not avoid interference competition by minimizing activity overlap. Thus, optimal activity patterns evolved to satisfy a diverse range of factors that differ amongst species. Competition avoidance is the primary cause of the temporal partitioning in activity between subordinate and top predators. Africa's carnivores have also evolved morphological adaptations to their activity patterns reflecting the length of time they have occurred in sympatry.",

    "abstract": "The Republic of Namibia recently lost a High Court case preventing the sale of antelope that were selectively bred and intensively managed to produce traits that are uncommon in the wild. This paper looks at the foundations that the Namibian government may draw on to develop a policy context which would enable the country to redraft and amend existing legislation. The Namibian Nature Conservation Ordinance has exceeded its usefulness, in that it is ill-equipped to maintain and protect the countrys' wildlife and its traditional enclosed extensive wildlife systems on private farms - and the Ordinance should be replaced. It is further concluded that the provisions of the Maputo Convention and the Nagoya Protocol apply to selective breeding and intensive management of wildlife. Caution is raised that provisions of these agreements, when read in isolation with the definition of biodiversity in the Namibian Environmental Management Act, may be interpreted in a manner contrary to the conservation of this resource. It is concluded that a formal inclusion of the public trust doctrine into the Namibian environmental jurisprudence, as has occurred in many African and countries elsewhere, would provide the necessary omnibus to address current and future challenges to the country's wildlife and other components of the environment.",

We use principles from this theory to assess strengths and weaknesses in (1) national legislation, and (2) the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Regulations applicable to the conservation of the Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) (CMZ) in South Africa. A legislated conservation tool, Biodiversity Management Plans for Species (BMP-S), establishes a collaborative network of role players and facilitates the important principles of collaborative learning and adaptation. Effective governance of this network is critical to success, but challenging because of a mandate gap and limited capacity in government to provide essential network-level competencies. National regulations governing human use of CMZ (Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations) accords with the principles of (1) being developed in consultation with stakeholders and (2) open to revision and adaptation. CITES Regulations also provide adequately for adaptation. Poor alignment of regulations between different regulatory authorities in South Africa and limited capacity for implementation of regulations seriously constrain learning and adaptation.",

In total, 200 specimens were trapped or shot and examined for external lesions. Selected tissues from three dead specimens were removed for histopathological examination. Eighty-eight (44%) of 200 specimens revealed lesions, the highest compared to other wild bird populations. Other species such as ducks, doves, pigeons, helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and other francolin species were also examined for similar lesions. Only one specimen (Coqui francolin, F. coqui) of 673 showed similar signs. This absence in other species suggests that Swainson’s francolin can serve as an indicator species for certain poxviruses in a local or regional context. Swainson’s francolin on the highveld showed a much higher prevalence of poxvirus infection than those in the bushveld. It is suggested that extreme cold conditions and lack of adequate food and cover during winter cause a stressful bottleneck. Swainson’s francolin are dispersed in summer but converge in winter into groups, facilitating the spread of the virus between individuals.",

The occurrence of this species in areas ranging from dry semi-deserts to coastal dune forests as well as their unspecialised diet led us to suggest that it is a true opportunist. This is supported by their unique adaptation to respond swiftly to sudden environmental changes during pregnancy, by being able to resorb part or all of their foetuses as late as ≈72 hours prior to parturition. Partial resorptions may furthermore occur more than once during the same pregnancy. No correlation between litter size and rainfall - an indicator of resource availability - was recorded, but litter size was more predictable in dry and wet environments than in intermediate environments. Furthermore, pregnant females were recorded throughout the year. We suggest that pouched mice occupy and breed in a variety of environments, including unpredictable environments, by being able to breed throughout the year and adapt litter size through resorption of foetuses when environmental conditions are less favourable.",

Towards this goal, male (n = 17) and female (n = 13), and adult (n = 23) and subadult (n = 7) buffaloes were slaughtered, and the weight of the carcass and various organs/offal and six major muscles [(biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM), semitendinosus (ST), longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL), infraspinatus (IS) and supraspinatus (SS)] determined. Buffaloes had a high dressing percentage, calculated from the warm carcass weight, and with the heaviest muscle weights measured for the BF, SM and LTL muscles. Adults had heavier muscle weights than subadults, and all parameters except the heart and IS muscle weight differed significantly between these age groups. In addition, the skin and head weight differed significantly between males and females. In summary, African savanna buffalo yields (∼58%) compared favourably to other domestic animals, with the heavy weight of valuable muscles suggesting their commercial potential as a high-end value-added product.",

We summed all bat passes and detector hours over microphones, sites and years for each month, and fitted a negative binomial regression model with total bat passes as the response and ecoregion as the predictor. Overall, there was a significant effect of ecoregion on the number of bat passes per detector hour recorded near ground level, and in the turbine rotor sweep. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the sites in Maputaland coastal forests and woodlands, and KwaZulu-Natal-Cape coastal forests, were most distinct due to exceptionally high levels of recorded activity. As such, we strongly advise against WEF development in these ecoregions. In lowland fynbos and renosterveld, Limpopo lowveld, and Albany thickets, where intermediate to high bat activity was recorded, we recommend that the conditions of WEF-authorizations must include rigorous bat impact mitigation measures. For operational WEFs, our results provided valuable benchmark information for devising bat fatality thresholds that reflect the variation in bat activity across South Africa's diverse landscape.",

    "abstract": "Malicious, commercial or retaliatory poisoning of wildlife is increasing across Africa, including the killing of elephants (Loxodonta africana) to supply the illegal ivory trade. Regional differences exist in the types of poisons used by poachers and in Zimbabwe cyanide has become more commonly employed in recent years – sourced illegally from its commercial use in the gold mining industry. Cyanide is potent, so can be rapidly lethal in small quantities and is also not too difficult or costly to source illegally. It is therefore a relatively low-risk option for any ivory poacher, even individuals not involved with criminal syndicates. On the positive side, however, cyanide has far fewer bio-accumulative and cycling properties in ecosystems than more frequently used poisons like pesticides. Detection and subsequent proof in a court of law, of the illegal use of cyanide in elephant carcasses, can be problematic to distinguish conclusively from other causes of sudden death. Therefore, proactive strategies to combat wildlife poisons are far more successful and the one proposed here against cyanide provides a good model. It encourages the establishment of strong intelligence networks to enable the arrest of poachers in possession of poisons before they are deployed in the field, and effective application of laws which now facilitate convictions for poaching. A key element in prosecution under recently revised Zimbabwean laws is proving that illegal possession of cyanide in the relevant circumstances includes the intent to use it for ivory poaching. Zimbabwe's legal experience in this respect could prove especially valuable to other countries facing similar threats of poison being used illegally to kill any wildlife species.",

    "abstract": "Pointing dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are primarily used to locate cryptic species or evidence thereof and often to establish their abundance. Environmental conditions at the time of search may influence the probability that a dog will detect a target. Here, we aimed to determine the environmental factors that affected the detection rate of a pointing dog detecting gamebirds in their natural environment under known atmospheric conditions, including temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind strength and solar radiation. We conducted uncontrolled trials in the Greater uMngeni Vlei Expansion Area of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa, between August 2020 – October 2021, where up to two pointing dogs repeatedly (n = 44) surveyed an environment with an abundance of Red-winged Francolin (Scleroptila levaillantii ). The index of abundance, measured as birds/minute of search, was compared for each survey whilst simultaneously monitoring the environmental conditions. We conducted controlled trials (n = 34) in the same region concurrently by independently casting two pointing dogs downwind of caged Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) of a known location to observe the point where each dog's behaviour changed to indicate scent detection. This approach enabled us to measure detection distance whilst simultaneously monitoring environmental conditions. We found that the index of abundance showed no correlation with any of the monitored environmental factors in the uncontrolled trials, most probably because of the low incidence of detection. We further established in controlled trials that detection distance was uncorrelated to ambient temperature and relative humidity but significantly positively correlated with solar radiation and wind strength. An increase of one-knot wind strength resulted in an increase in detection distance by 0.64 m. Our study lays the foundation for developing an area-based survey method, considerate of environmental conditions, to detect cryptic bird species by dogs in conservation projects.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural intensification can result in extremely fragmented landscapes with typically only small natural areas remaining. The South African macadamia industry is expanding dramatically, with over 5000 ha planted per year. Remaining natural vegetation around macadamia orchards will be key to retain important ecosystem services such as biological pest control of insects provided by, amongst others, insectivorous bats. We evaluated how the activity of bat species on macadamia farms within different land-use mosaics is related to general insect abundance and what role the phenological stages of macadamias play. Recordings of bat echolocation and insect light trap collections were conducted (July 2019 – March 2020) at different edges of land-use types on two macadamia farms in Hazyview, South Africa. Results showed that edge type significantly influenced bat activity and insect abundance with natural vegetation edges recording the highest bat activity (n = 3153) and insect abundance (n = 16 524). River edges (bat n = 1635, insect n = 11 284) presented lower activity and abundance than natural edges but still double that of road edges (bat n = 695, insect n = 3743). Bat activity was also higher during developing-nut and mature phenology stages when pest insects peak. Bats from all foraging guilds were recorded during the study, which points towards a more intact bat assemblage within the study area compared to other macadamia areas in South Africa. Our study highlights the importance of retaining natural vegetation within an agricultural land-use mosaic to maintain biological pest control.",

    "abstract": "Grey Crowned Cranes (Balearica regulorum), an endangered species that occurs throughout eastern and south-central Africa, are generally well-protected within national parks but commonly occur outside protected areas where the landscape is largely used for agriculture, settlement, and grazing. Understanding a species' distribution and collecting information on its presence from people who have long-standing interactions in an area of interest (i.e. local ecological knowledge) can be cost-effective for conservation. Thus, during February–December 2015, we gathered local knowledge from villagers to help inform Grey Crowned Crane status, distribution, breeding, and seasonal habitat use outside protected areas in Tanzania. Via 560 in-person surveys in 41 villages, local people identified 46 locations where they reported seeing cranes. In two regions, the proportion of crane observations by local people was higher in the wet season than the dry season, but in two others the proportion of crane observations were high in both seasons. Little evidence of crane breeding was reported, but a high proportion of local people in the Kilimanjaro region reported seeing crane chicks relative to the other regions. We modelled the influence of land-cover types and demographic variables on the number of people who reported seeing Grey Crowned Cranes in their wards (subunits of regions). Residents were more likely to see cranes in areas that were less populated by people with few human activities. An increase in grassland habitats in a ward increased the chances of people sighting cranes. While seasonal wetlands are important crane habitats, the model indicated a negative relationship between number of people seeing cranes and the percentage of wetlands in their wards; this may be due to the occurrence of degraded (unsuitable) wetlands. Local knowledge can provide insights into species' distribution and ecology, but there is a need for more field monitoring of cranes.",

    "abstract": "By studying the host-selection patterns of oxpecker species, researchers can gain valuable insights into their ecological roles and interactions with different host species. This information is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies that prioritise the protection of oxpeckers and their host populations. The study conducted field observations and recorded data on the number of oxpeckers and their respective host species. Additionally, this study investigated the relationship between host species and host parameters (body mass and hair length) in the Salambala conservancy in northeastern Namibia. Selection and density indices were used to calculate the number of host animals supporting one oxpecker as well as the oxpecker density on a host's body surface. Pentad-based counts of oxpeckers and ungulates were conducted. Of the observed oxpeckers, 75% were Red-billed and 25% Yellow-billed Oxpeckers. These findings suggest that Red-billed Oxpeckers (Buphagus erythrorhynchus) are more commonly found on host species than Yellow-billed Oxpeckers (Buphagus africanus). The selection index indicates that Red-billed Oxpeckers have a higher preference for impala (Aepyceros melampus) compared to cattle (Bos taurus), while Yellow-billed Oxpeckers show a lower preference for goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) compared to cattle. The selection indices for impala and cattle for both oxpecker species were highest during the wet season. In terms of correlation analysis, there were no significant correlations between selection and density indices and host hair length or species-typical body mass.",

Most wattled crane nests were in unchannelled plains wetlands with short vegetation which covered 51 to 75% of the wetland surface. Grey crowned cranes predominantly nested in channelled plains wetlands with very tall vegetation which covered 76 to 100% of the wetland. Wattled cranes also nested in wetlands which were more pristine than those chosen by grey crowned cranes.

The temporal variation within the cephalopod component was investigated. A low diversity of cephalopods, only six species, are preyed upon, with Todarodes angolensisl/Ig being the most important component both in numbers and wet weight in all years. Its lowered weight contribution during winter coincided with a greater diversity of other cephalopod species in the diet, which showed higher proportional weight contribution relative to Todarodes angolensis . Scat sampling was found to be an unreliable method of providing estimates of total prey weight consumption by seals, but was considered an acceptable method for proportional comparisons, especially given the ease of scat collection over extended periods.",

The long and highly convoluted intermediate length of excurrent duct probably represents the body and tail of the epididymis.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the food of rock pigeons ( Columba guinea ) at a cattle feedlot in Gauteng province (South Africa) and determine how population size and movement were affected by agriculture on the Highveld. Fieldwork was undertaken at a cattle feedlot from April 1998 to August 2003. The rock pigeons fed selectively and preferred undigested maize seeds with high moisture content directly from cattle dung. Unlike feral rock doves C. livia , rock pigeons do not consume dry maize seeds and therefore do not take food directly from cattle feed bunkers. This effectively excludes rock pigeons as a possible transmitter of faecal-borne pathogens via their droppings in cattle feed. The unheralded arrival of up to 5000 pigeons at the feedlot was interpreted as an indication of how these pigeons respond in numbers to environmental quality. This study suggests that on the Highveld, rock pigeons gather in huge congregations at feedlots just prior to the ripening of sunflower seeds and thus offer hunting opportunities during this time window. Wet grains like sunflower seeds seem to be an important determinant of flocking behaviour among rock pigeons on the Highveld.",

    "abstract": "The trophy hunting of lions is contentious due to increasing evidence of impacts on wild populations, and ethical concerns surrounding the hunting of captive-bred lions in South Africa. The captive-bred lion hunting industry in South Africa has grown rapidly while the number of wild lions hunted in other African countries has declined. In 2009 and 2010, 833 and 682 lion trophies were exported from South Africa, respectively, more than double the combined export (2009, 471; 2010, 318) from other African countries. There has been an associated increase in the prevalence of the export of lion bones from South Africa: at least 645 bones/sets of bones were exported in 2010, 75.0% of which went to Asia. Such trade could be problematic if it stimulated demand for bones from wild lions or other wild felids. Captive-bred lion hunting differs from wild lion hunting in that lions are hunted in smaller areas (49.9 ± 8.4 km2 compared to 843 to 5933 km2, depending on the country), hunts are cheaper (US$20 000-40 000 compared to US$37 000-76 000 [excluding the costs of shooting other species and government charges]), shorter (3.3 compared to 14-21 days), success rates are higher (99.2% compared to 51.0-96.0%), and trophy quality is higher (skull length + breadth = 638.8 compared to 614-638 cm). Most clients perceive captive-bred and wild lion hunting to be different products but there is some overlap in markets: 48.7% of clients that had hunted captive-bred lions showed no preference regarding the type of future hunts. Owing to the size of the captive-bred hunting industry, even marginal overlap in demand could affect wild lion hunting significantly. If captive-bred lion hunting were ever prohibited, a transfer of demand to wild lion hunts could lead to elevated off-takes with negative impacts on wild populations. However, if off-takes of wild lions were held constant or reduced through effective regulation of quotas, increased demand could increase the price of wild lion hunts and strengthen financial incentives for lion conservation. These possibilities should be considered if future efforts are made to regulate captive-bred lion hunting.",

Farmland, especially game farming areas, can potentially be suitable for wild dog conservation. However, little is known about them in these areas. To increase our understanding regarding the presence and general ecology of wild dogs on private land we used a camera trapping picture database initially used to census leopards (Panthera pardus) to report on wild dog presence on private farmland and reserves within the Waterberg Biosphere, South Africa. We identified nine different wild dogs from the camera trap images and all wild dog signs were restricted to Lapalala. We further supplemented the data set with opportunistically collected scats to report on wild dog prey use. Only three species could be identified in the scats, namely bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), impala (Aepyceros melampus) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), with bushbuck the most important prey species. Our results show that some wild dogs still persist on private land in the Waterberg, confirming that private land can play an important role in wild dog conservation. We suggest that conservation efforts focussing on mitigation actions to improve local tolerance towards wild dogs would be the most efficient action to secure a viable wild dog population.",

    "abstract": "The apparent restriction of the endangered geometric tortoise Psammobates geometricus to the renosterveld vegetation type of the Western Cape Province was assessed. Geometric tortoises are absent from coastal strandveld and coastal fynbos regions, possibly owing to the generally drier prevailing climatic conditions and higher predation pressure in more open habitat. Absence from wetter, less fertile mountain fynbos areas may be related to denser vegetation and scarcity of food plants. Topographical position in the landscape, rather than altitude, determines their preference for low-lying, well-drained areas. Higher percentage occurrence of favoured food plants in renosterveld reflects a close dependence on this habitat and may be the key element for their endemicity to renosterveld. Geometric tortoise micro-habitat is situated within the 350-600 mm annual winter rainfall range, and is characterized by low-lying, relatively open, medium-high renosterveld with characteristic shrub, restioid, annual herbaceous and perennial grass cover.\nDie klaarblyklike beperking van die bedreigde suurpootjieskilpad Psammobates geometricus tot die renosterveld-plantegroeitipe van die Wes-Kaapprovinsie is geevalueer. Suurpootjies is afwesig van strandveld en kusfynbos moontlik weens die algemeen droer klimaatstoestande en hoer predasiedruk in 'n meer oop habitat. Hul afwesigheid van algemeen klammer en minder vrugbare bergfynbosgebiede mag die gevolg wees van digter plantegroei en die skaarsheid van voedselplante. Topografiese posisie, en nie hoogte bo seespieel nie, bepaal hul voorkeur vir laagliggende, goedgedreineerde gebiede. Hoer persentasie voorkoms van voorkeur-voedselplante in renosterveld dui op 'n noue verbintenis met hierdie habitat en mag die sleutelaspek van hul beperking tot renosterveld wees. Suurpootjie-mikrohabitat le binne die 350-600 mm jaarlikse winterreenvalgebied en word gekenmerk deur laagliggende, relatief oop, medium-hoe renosterveld met kenmerkende struik-, riet-, eenjarige kruidgewas- en meerjarige grasbedekking.",

In response to reports from numerous game farmers regarding gemsbok mortalities, a study was conducted on the Tussen-die-Riviere Game Farm. It was established that the Karoo paralysis tick Ixodes rubicundus was responsible for paralysis and mortalities amongst the gemsbok. The mean burden of female Karoo paralysis ticks on paralysed sub-adult gemsbok was 0,83 ticks/kg host body mass (range: 0,26-2,12) compared with a burden of 0,12 ticks/kg host body mass (range: 0,03-0,18) on healthy adult animals. Gemsbok with high tick burdens are therefore more likely to suffer paralysis compared with gemsbok with a lower tick burden. No dead or paralysed calves or adult gemsbok were found. Paralysed gemsbok were found during May and June of each year and this closely corresponds to the peak period of activity of the Karoo paralysis tick.",

Extant metrics used to describe the spatial distribution of water sources on the landscape often fall short of providing source-specific information, making them hard to apply in small-scale management settings. Using the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve (KPNR) as a case study, we compare a buffer framework, describing distances to water, a nearest neighbour framework, and a spatial location-allocation framework (SLAF) created in a geographic information system (GIS). These three frameworks can be combined into one GIS to demonstrate site-specific information on water source distribution, in addition to system-wide descriptions. The visually accessible quality of a GIS allows qualitative input from managers and property owners to achieve quantifiable management goals. The duality of database and visual representation provides a useful tool to assess the role of individual water sources and can easily be updated to reflect changes in their distribution.",

The number of species recorded did not differ significantly between treatments, \nalthough mild sites, when matched with control sites, had a marginally higher species count. \nMild fires may increase the diversity of habitats available to birds.

Core home ranges based on 50% adaptive kernel calculations proved useful for depicting spatial associations among individuals and shifts in areas of occupation. The mean home \nrange size (minimum convex polygon) was 11.7 kmlsupg2l/supg and that of core adaptive kernel 6.8 km 2 . Annual and individual variations in home range size were great and social factors clearly affected size. For these and other reasons great caution is recommended in interpretation and inter-population comparisons of home range sizes. Most individuals in this expanding \npopulation showed mobility, with home ranges shifting over time. Although clearly exhibiting individual home ranges, most females associated in clusters of three or more individuals. Calves generally moved away from their mothers at the time of her next calving, but some subsequently moved back into their mothers' core home range. In addition to mother-offspring pairs, some females also showed multiple-year associations in these clusters. Male home ranges overlapped, and individuals showed multiple-year associations until they reached approximately nine years of age. Males over age 8 were rarely sighted in the core home range of other similarly aged males.",

    "abstract": "A pride of lions (Panthera leo) was studied on a 15 km 2 \nreserve using radio-telemetry. Kills were recorded from direct observations, as well as reserve management records. The prey base was enumerated by an aerial and road count and the standing biomass crop was calculated. The daily food intake per lioness was calculated to range from 4.1 ± 1.3 (S.E.) to 4.6 ± 2.4 (S.E.) kg / day. Two approaches for determining the sustainability of lions were evaluated : a) Large Herbivore Biomass (LHB) and b) Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY) of the main prey. The term Lion Feeding Unit (LFU) was introduced to depict the feeding requirements of an adult lioness. It was calculated that the LHB could support 185 LFUs / 100 km 2 , which was clearly not sustainable in the context of prey declines at an LFU density of 50 LFUs / 100 km 2 . The MSY of prey could sustain 6.7 LFUs / 100 km 2 , which would reverse prey declines if prey populations were initially maintained at 1/2 K .This capacity was recommended for savannas receiving between 500 and 700 mm rainfall per annum, and where no other carnivores were present. This capacity was, however, too low for small reserves ( 2 ) where a large group of lions is needed for aesthetic and economic purposes. A trade-off is suggested where a normal pride size (4-10) is prescribed, but with the understanding that prey declines are inevitable and that prey will need to be replenished on an annual basis.",

This perception was based on the lack of reference to sightings of giraffe in early colonial literature and the lack of giraffe remains in archaeological sites within KwaZulu-Natal. We have reviewed the literature and found no reliable reference to giraffe in early colonial writings and no reports of rock art featuring giraffe in the area. However, there are recent reports of the recovery of giraffe bones from the Middle Stone Age deposits at Sibudu Shelter, the Holocene hunter-gatherer deposits at Maqonqo Shelter and from the Early Iron Age agriculturist site of KwaGandaganda, all within KwaZulu-Natal. We argue that giraffe were present 1000 BP (date of most recent excavation evidencing giraffe remains), but had died out or been extirpated by c.220 BP (date of written accounts). The demise of giraffe between 1000 and 220 BP may be linked to disease, climate change or anthropogenic causes. The finding of giraffe remains within KwaZulu-Natal raises the possibility that they should be considered as native to the area.",

However, cheetahs are notoriously difficult to survey because they occur at very low population densities and are often shy and elusive. In South Africa the problem is further complicated in areas where land is privately owned, restricting access, with dense bush and cheetahs that are frequently persecuted. Cheetahs are individually identifiable by their unique spot patterns, making them ideal candidates for capture-recapture surveys. Photographs of cheetahs were obtained using four camera traps placed successively at a total of 12 trap locations in areas of known cheetah activity within a 300 km2 area in the Thabazimbi district of the Limpopo Province. During 10 trapping periods, five different cheetahs were photographed. These results were used to generate capture histories for each cheetah and the data were analysed using the capture-recapture software package CAPTURE. Closure tests indicated that the population was closed (P = 0.056). The Mh model was used to deal with possible heterogeneous capture probabilities among individual cheetahs. Closure tests did not reject the model assumption of population closure (P = 0.056). The Mh model produced a capture probability of 0.17 with an estimate of 6-14 cheetahs (P = 0.95) and a mean population size of seven cheetahs (S.E. = 1.93). These results are promising and will be improved with employment of more camera traps and sampling a larger area.",

The factors determining the effectiveness of electric fences are not fully understood. We assessed the performance of Namelok and Kimana fences in reducing human-elephant conflict by comparing the frequency of crop-raiding by elephants and the perceptions of farmers on the effect of the fences in reducing elephant crop-raiding within fenced and adjacent unfenced farmlands. We also examined the effect of intact fence wires, presence of current and amount of voltage on fence breakage by elephants. Electric fencing reduced elephant crop-raiding and other forms of human-elephant conflicts. Namelok fence was not broken by elephants whereas Kimana fence was broken several times probably because it borders Kimana Sanctuary which provided cover where elephants could retreat after crop-raiding. The mere presence of current did not minimize fence breakage by elephants. Elephants entered fenced areas more frequently when the fence wires were broken than when wires were intact. Our results suggest that, location of fences in relation to landscape factors, maintenance of effective non-electrified fences and proximity of fences to areas of high elephant concentration are significant determinants of fence performance in mitigating elephant crop-raiding.",

This animal is not much affected by turbid water as it locates prey by touch, and usually forages close to shores or banks. Evidence of presence in given localities and habitats, distributed over a large area of the Northern, Western, and Eastern Cape provinces, was deduced from signs (faecal deposits or distinctive tracks) on land. Accepting the inherent pitfalls of this approach we nevertheless feel using it is acceptable for a first approximation of habitat preferences over a large geographical area. Results point to areas with dense reed beds and a rocky substrate on banks being used most intensively, probably on account of a localized high food biomass.",

A total of 662 kills were recorded, with blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), zebra (Equus burchelli) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) being the most preferred species. Although there was preference for these species, and adult prey were favoured, there was no significant selection for prey size, age or gender. There was a significant difference in the number of kills made when the two-male coalition was present as opposed to the single pride male. The solitary pride male spent significantly more time with the females and shared most of their kills, and during this period dispersing subadult males killed a substantial amount of prey when separated from the pride. Knowledge on predator feeding behaviour is important for managers to assess impact on prey populations in small reserves in order to manage them correctly, thereby preventing depletion of such populations.",

    "abstract": "Wild mammals in Africa mostly have high levels of innate resistance to haemoparasites and the tick vectors that transmit them. Occasionally though, biotic and abiotic factors combine to alter this relationship and tick-borne disease is diagnosed in wildlife. We postulate an inter-relationship between anthropogenic and natural factors that resulted in wildlife mortality, attributable to disease transmission associated with a gradual build-up of large numbers of ticks. Suppression of grassland fire for 27 years in a distinct ecological unit promoted a gradual expansion of areas covered by tall grass. Changes in composition of the pasture led to improved tick survival, which was further boosted by the availability of increasing numbers of a coarse-grazing species and preferred tick host, African buffalo. Alternating climatic cycles then appeared to precipitate an outbreak of tick-borne haemolytic disease by subjecting ticks and their herbivore hosts to ideal conditions (in wet years) followed by starvation and immune suppression (in dry years). Evidence supporting the hypothesis was gathered retrospectively in the present study through systematic sampling of tick density and correlating life stages of ticks to season, grass species and height of the grass sward. Tick host preference was noted by collection from immobilized wild animals and sympatric livestock. A long series of census data confirmed the changing composition of resident wild herbivores in the Ngorongoro Crater. To reduce the tick challenge, prescribed burning of the crater grassland was reintroduced; tick numbers fell rapidly and three years of subsequent monitoring confirmed the success of this strategy.",

These results support the hypothesis that rainfall and its indirect effects (improved cover and access to drinking water and increased biomass and availability of plant and arthropod food) are limiting factors to northern Cape game bird populations.

    "abstract": "As human populations and developments expand, it is inevitable that interactions between wildlife and electrical infrastructure will increase. Such is the case in protected areas, where mammal electrocutions often occur as a result of damaged electrical infrastructure. In a previous study, a camera trap survey along a power line in the Kruger National Park (Kruger) revealed that large mammals [particularly Cape buffalo, Syncerus caffer, rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum and Diceros bicornis) and African elephant, Loxodonta africana] damaged wooden utility poles by rubbing or pushing against them. Such interactions can result in poles breaking, creating high electrocution risks to wildlife. In this study, we tested four mitigation measures (steel sleeve, VB Rhino, Grating box and Polefix industrial cast) for their effectiveness in reducing damaging contact between these four large mammals and wooden electrical poles. Camera traps were set up along the Foskor-Kruger 22 kV power line in the Kruger over 16 months to monitor wildlife interactions at experimentally treated (n = 14) and control (n = 8) utility poles. Direct contact between large mammals (buffalo: 64%, rhino: 23%, elephant: 11%) and poles made up 71% of pole–wildlife interactions. A cost– benefit analysis was undertaken to determine the most cost-effective mitigation measure. Our findings suggest that implementing mitigation measures can reduce wildlife-pole interactions and subsequently reduce the risk of wildlife electrocutions in protected areas. Based on both its effectiveness, advantages and cost, we recommend using the Grating box mitigation method to reduce large mammal damage to poles in the Kruger.",

We investigated nutrient deposition associated with defecation, urination, and scent-marking at latrine sites of a semi-aquatic predator species (African clawless otters Aonyx capensis) in a riparian zone of a Bankenveld savanna ecosystem. We provide a comparison of stable nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) measured in soil, vegetation and faecal material, between latrine and paired control sites. Latrine sites displayed higher δ15N values than the paired non-latrine sites, but only at the area of direct deposition (soil surfaces). This effect dissipated as the distance from direct contact increased, while no significant difference in δ15N values was detected for sub-surface soil samples. Plants displayed varying trends of enriched δ15N values between the latrine and paired control sites. These results suggest that several factors and processes such as leaching, mineralization, ammonia volatilization, and nitrogen acquisition influence the nutrient availability within latrine-soil-vegetation systems in riparian zones of African savanna ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Management of protected areas requires an understanding of the long-term population trends of large mammal species that may influence ecosystem functioning. Common eland (Tragelaphus oryx) are the most abundant large mammal species in the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park. Aerial and ground surveys have been conducted over the years to monitor the common eland population. This study addressed long-term trends in population size, structure, distribution and mortality of the common eland between 1942 and 2018, examining changes in relation to climate, natural impacts, management, and efficacy of surveys. The common eland population in the Drakensberg remained relatively stable from 1942 to 1982, then increased between 1983 and 1990. However, a continuous decline was observed between 2003 and 2018 concomitant with a 37% reduction in distribution range within the Park. Adults constituted 59.4% of the population over the entire period, while subadults and calves accounted for 19.1% and 18.8%, respectively, with the remaining 2.7% of unknown ages. The ratio of adults: subadults: calves was 1: 0.32: 0.32 and males: females was 1: 3.63, indicating a skewed sex ratio and a low number of juveniles in the population. Human activities had a substantial impact on the population, with 30.3% of mortalities attributed to poaching. However, permitted offtakes of an unknown number may be the most important cause of mortality. Increased movement of eland onto farmlands outside of the protected area appears to have contributed to a decline in their distribution within the Park in recent years; however, this does not affect population trend since those on farmland are still included in counts. There is no cause for concern regarding the population trend at present; however, if the observed population decline continues well beyond the population numbers recorded in 1942, then there is cause for a management response by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife for the common eland population in the Drakensberg.",

    "abstract": "Fire ecological research within the Cape Floristic Region is largely restricted to fynbos vegetation and, amongst fauna, birds. Nothing is known about post-fire responses of birds in subtropical thicket, which burns on much longer cycles than fynbos. Extensive fires in subtropical thicket along the southeastern Cape coast (in the Knysna area during June 2017) presented the opportunity to assess the response of these birds to fire. We predicted that (1) fire reduces bird species diversity, richness and abundance in thicket during the first two years post-fire; and (2) fire changes feeding guild composition and results in the loss of frugivorous birds. Bird surveys (point counts) were undertaken between 12- and 21-months post-fire in burnt (n =7) and unburnt (n = 7) thicket sites to determine bird community structure and abundance. A total of 66 bird species and 2404 individuals were recorded of which 52 species and 1176 individuals were recorded in burnt thicket and 60 species and 1228 individuals in unburnt thicket. Ten species occurred only in burnt thicket and 13 species only in unburnt thicket. There was a 21% loss of bird species (mainly forest birds) after fire. The Sørenson similarity coefficient was 60% for bird species composition between burnt and unburnt thicket. The most common feeding guilds in terms of richness and abundance in both burnt and unburnt thicket were insectivores and generalists. Frugivores were most abundant in unburnt thicket, whereas granivores were most abundant in burnt thicket. Changes in thicket bird community composition following the fire were minor and are likely to be short-lived as thicket shrubs re-sprout vigorously after fire resulting in rapid recovery of vegetation and thus bird habitat structure.",

This list categorizes threatened species assessed for risks of extinction. The IUCN Green Status is a new global standard of measurement created by IUCN to help show how a species is functioning within the ecological system it inhabits, and how much it has recovered thanks to conservation action. For the new Green Status, we provide an assessment of four conservation impact measures for the black rhino – conservation legacy, conservation dependence, conservation gain and recovery potential. Time sequences of estimates for four subspecies of black rhinos, collated from data provided by range States and various sources in the literature, provide the basis of this evaluation. Our findings reveal that in the absence of conservation interventions, the year 2022 would only have seen 296 black rhinos compared to 6487 reported, a legacy of 6191 individuals. If conservation interventions had been stopped in 2022, there would be 3354 black rhinos in 2032, i.e. there is a conservation dependence of 3133 rhinos. If conservation interventions continue, there will be 8943 black rhinos in 2032, a conservation gain of 2456 individuals, compared to the number in 2022. Various global change drivers contribute to available habitat for 20 952 black rhinos in 2122. Our analysis illustrated that the rhino recovery potential by 2022 was 14 465. For this to continue and materialize fully, the authorities will need to consider introducing ecological equivalent subspecies into available habitat, within ranges of extinct subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Community Based Natural Resource Management in Namibia is known as an exemplary conservation programme giving local communities rights over the use of wildlife resources. Monitoring of wildlife population numbers and trends is essential in conservancies to manage wildlife for sustainable benefits and reduced human–wildlife conflict. Nyae Nyae Conservancy conducts systematic wildlife monitoring, inclusive of carnivores. Monitoring carnivore presence and distribution is important because they are often the leading cause of livestock depredation in the area. Incidences of livestock depredation by carnivores are recorded in the conservancy, helping inform decision-making regarding the need to reduce or relocate problem-causing carnivores. To complement these incidence records, annual foot transect counts and spoor surveys of carnivores were introduced in 2017. This study compared the relative species richness, number of observations and their distribution detected by regular counts, spoor surveys, and human–wildlife conflict incidence reports for ten carnivore species in Nyae Nyae Conservancy. Between 2017 and 2022, there were an average of 17 physical sightings, 25 human–wildlife conflict incidents, and 208 spoor recordings of the ten target carnivore species per year. The highest annual species richness for physical surveys was five, while spoor of all ten species were only identified in 2019. In 2021 and 2022, a total of five carnivore species were involved in human–wildlife conflict incidents, the highest recorded during the study period. Over the six-year period, the relative abundance of species to each other correlated significantly between spoor surveys and human–wildlife conflict incidence frequency, while there was no relationship between spoor surveys and transect visual sightings, or between sightings and human–wildlife conflict incidence. The study indicates that spoor counts are effective in detecting the presence of carnivore species, but do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of the overall abundance and proportional abundance of carnivores.",

There were significant differences between counts of overflying Namaqua sandgrouse, and those that landed and drank at a watering site. Counts on the day preceding the hunt and counts during hunts were also significantly different. Furthermore, sandgrouse which do not drink, take part in group socializing or have a dust bath at the watering site. Individually marked sandgrouse drank as frequently as on four consecutive days. Birds landing, or apparently intending to land should be counted, both during hunting and when hunting is not in progress. Because some sandgrouse which are disturbed by hunters attempt to return to the same watering site during a hunt, counts conducted at hunts should be multiplied by a factor slightly less than 1,0 (i.e. 0,74) to obtain more reliable population estimates. Average total counts of birds landing, or apparently intending to land, may be used for population estimates by relating the count to the land area serviced by the watering site.\nDie verskeidenheid van metodes wat gebruik word om die kelkiewyn Pterocles namaqua by waterplekke te tel, en die klaarblyklike gebrek aan eenstemmigheid betreffende die frekwensie waarteen hulle drink, verminder die bruikbaarheid van sulke tellings vir skatting van bevolkingsgroottes. Daar was statisties betekenisvolle verskille tussen tellings by waterplekke, van kelkiewyne wat oorgevlieg, geland en gedrink het. Tellings op die dag voor die jag en op die dag van die jag, het ook statisties betekenisvol verskil.

Sixteen of these mortalities occurred during a 132-day study period. Assuming reduced tortoise activity in winter, a conservative mortality rate of about 30 tortoises per year is estimated along the electrified fence in the reserve. Using regression curves based on detailed measurements of 109 leopard tortoises, the total length and shell height of 42 of the electrocuted animals were calculated from their plastron lengths. Most tortoises (93%) killed were young adults (200-400 mm total length). The height of the electrified wire measured at the point of electrocution of 30 dead tortoises was, with one exception, less than 200 mm above ground level. To reduce tortoise mortality in the reserve it is recommended that the electrified wire height be maintained at at least 250 mm above ground level, and that the fences be powered only at night.\nTwee en vyftig dooie skilpaaie (50 bergskilpaaie Geochelone pardalis, een ploegskaarskilpad Chersina angulata en een gewone waterskilpad Pelomedusa subrufa) is langs 8,4 km geelektrifiseerde omheinings in die Thomas Baines-natuurreservaat in die oostelike Kaapprovinsie gevind. Sestien van hierdie skilpadvrektes het plaasgevind gedurende 'n studietydperk van 132 dae. As aanvaar word dat skilpaaie minder aktief is gedurende die winter, dan word daar na beraming ongeveer 30 skilpaaie jaarliks deur hierdie geelektrifiseerde drade gedood in die reservaat. Met behulp van regressiekrommes,gebaseer op mates van 109 bergskilpaaie, is die plastronlengtes van 42 van die dooie skilpaaie gebruik om hul totale lengtes en dophoogtes te bereken. Die meeste van die dooie skilpaaie (93%) was jong volwassenes (200-400 mm totale lengte). Die hoogte van die geelektrifiseerde drade, gemeet by die punt van elektrokusie van 30 skilpaaie was, met een uitsondering, minder as 200 mm bokant grondvlak. Dit word aanbeveel dat die hoogte van geelektrifiseerde drade ten minste 250 mm bokant grondvlak gehandhaaf word, en dat heinings slegs gedurende die nag geelektrifiseer word om sodoende skilpadmortaliteit in die reservaat te verlaag.",

    "abstract": "In South Africa, at the periphery of its distribution, the saddlebilled stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis has been most abundant in areas where human activity has been limited by factors such as disease or conservation protectionism, e.g. the Kruger National Park (KNP). This is perhaps the primary reason for the unchanged distribution of the saddlebilled stork in South Africa. A statistical power analysis is carried out to determine whether the current survey methods conducted in the KNP, which count storks incidentally, are sufficient to detect trends in population size. The surveys are unable to detect assumed trends and, in order to do so, marked improvements will have to take place. Two other methods have been used to count the KNP saddlebilled stork population, (i) a specific saddlebilled stork aerial survey and (ii) a modified capture-recapture technique based on individual photographic recognition. Both of these have greater power to detect trends in population size than those presently undertaken by the park authorities. Of these two methods, the latter has a greater ability to detect decreasing population trends. However, because of logistic and temporal constraints which will negatively affect technique precision, a specific saddle billed stork aerial survey is proposed as the method most able to monitor population trends. However, a combination of aerial and photographic estimation techniques will also yield demographic data, which are as yet unavailable.",

However, animals such as warthog ( Phacochoerus aethiopicus ), porcupine ( Hystrix africaeaustralis ) and aardvark (Orycteropus afer) dig holes under game fences, allowing access to predators such as cheetah ( Acinonyx jubatus ). Swing gates were installed along a 4800 m section of game fencing in the Otjiwarongo district of Namibia. The fence was monitored before and after gate installation and trip cameras were used to identify species that used the gates. Warthog, aardvark and porcupines commonly used the gates and the number of holes under the fencing was significantly reduced following gate installation. No predators were observed \nusing the swing gates and the cost was substantially lower than fence electrification This initial research suggests that swing gates could be an important non-lethal predator exclusion technique, although further studies will be needed to confirm their long-term effectiveness. Using techniques such as swing gates, which effectively and economically \nreduce the frequency with which animals dig holes under fences may not only benefit farmers, but also reduce the unnecessary destruction of non-target wildlife species resulting from unselective trapping.",

The reasons for this decline remain unknown. We investigated possible drivers of this decline in the southern Kalahari of Botswana. We assessed springbok resource selection levels, movement behaviour and seasonal and spatial effects on the juvenile:adult female ratio. Springbok displayed high levels of forage and habitat selection. Their dependency on pan habitats renders their distribution predictable, which could expose them to high levels of predation and poaching. Springbok moved shorter daily distances during the hot dry and longer distances during wet seasons. High temperatures during the hot dry season could limit movement and prevent exploitation of spatially and temporally heterogeneous resources. We recorded a ratio of 0.37 juvenile:1 adult female in the wet season months followed by a ratio decline to 0.10:1 in the subsequent cold dry season, indicating a low recruitment rate that could be contributing to the springbok population decline. Environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, will likely exert a negative influence on selective foragers like springbok.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific competition among terrestrial carnivores can have widespread impacts on community structure and can ultimately determine which species are able to coexist. Within the carnivore guild, coexistence can be achieved through either spatial, temporal or dietary partitioning. The most effective method of avoiding competition may be spatial partitioning, as it removes the potential for negative interactions. The ways in which large carnivore species utilize and partition space in small, enclosed reserves in South Africa is currently poorly understood. This knowledge gap weakens our understanding of which mechanisms structure large carnivore communities in these systems. Thus, our aim was to use Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to investigate the spatial dynamics of large carnivores [four lions (Panthera leo), three leopards (Panthera pardus) and three spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta)] on a small, enclosed reserve (Selati Game Reserve). Regarding home ranges, lions had considerable overlap among themselves (especially the females), leopards had minimal overlap, while spotted hyaenas had no home range overlap. Although we found no evidence for spatial partitioning amongst the collared large carnivores, differences in the habitat use patterns of the three large carnivore species is evident. The high prey abundance of Selati, carnivore predation strategies, behavioural adaptations and ecological separation could be facilitating the coexistence of lions, spotted hyaenas and leopards in Selati. We encourage future research to be aimed at investigating the interactions of multiple sympatric carnivores in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap on which mechanisms structure carnivore communities.",

    "abstract": "African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are obligate cooperative breeders and are generally considered mono-oestrus. As such, the birth of two litters within the same year rarely occurs, except for when pups from the initial litter are lost soon after birth. We report on a rare occurrence where a wild dog female (Vee) produced three litters of pups within a 13-month, 2-week period from March 2015 to June 2016, with surviving pups from each litter. Data on breeding females from wild dog packs in the study area (Savé Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe) were used to identify whether any predictor variables (e.g. environmental or pack dynamics) could have influenced this unusual occurrence. The period over which the high number of litters were born had high prey densities and there was some evidence that it was associated with lower temperatures. High impala (Aepyceros melampus) densities during 2015 was likely to have been advantageous for the packs' hunting behaviours, while lower temperatures have been shown to increase the percentage of the day that is cool enough for wild dogs to hunt. Pack size during this period was higher in the pack that produced multiple litters (by the same female) than for other packs in the study site, which supports existing evidence that larger packs are able to produce more pups. Our results suggest that either 1) under ideal environmental and social conditions African wild dog females are capable of producing multiple litters throughout the year or that 2) this occurrence was an anomaly unique to Vee and her physiology.",

    "abstract": "Understanding changes in the population density of cryptic gamebirds may be useful for land managers when designing or adjusting grassland management regimes to conserve these species and the grasslands. The population density of Red-winged Francolin (Scleroptila levaillantii ) indicates the presence of their preferred grassland habitat. Pointing dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are often used to locate these and other cryptic gamebirds either for conservation or recreational purposes. We developed a reliable method to count cryptic gamebirds using pointing dogs where the route chosen through a survey site is flexible. Between August 2020 and October 2021, we conducted surveys (n = 21) to determine the density of Red-winged Francolin, a grassland indicator species. These comprised survey portions (n = 77) on four survey sites in the Greater uMngeni Vlei Expansion Area of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. We used up to two pointing dogs fitted with global positioning system (GPS) devices to survey and record the nominal wind speed. These data were used to calculate the detection distance and establish the search area. The redundancy of search, where a dog or possibly two dogs covered their own tracks, enabled us to evaluate the relative efficiency of detecting Red-winged Francolin. We used this method to establish the population density, search area per covey, and search area per bird in the sourveld grassland region of the four study sites. We calculated the coefficient of variation when estimating the population density whilst searching with one dog (C.V.: 133%) to be materially greater than when surveying with two dogs (C.V.: 54%), demonstrating significantly better precision with the latter. The four study sites' mean birds per covey (3.4 ± 1.44) and search area per covey (14.8 ± 7.5 ha) were consistent with previous studies indicating the grassland status as good. Our study outlines the foundation for a method that citizen scientists comprising field trial participants, pointing dog enthusiasts, and hunters can adopt to establish the abundance of Red-winged Francolin and other cryptic gamebirds with conservation and land management applications.",

    "abstract": "Wildlife farming, or game ranching, collectively termed here as the wildlife sector, has changed over the past few decades in South Africa, leading to growth in conservation and green economy, but resulting in an increase in wildlife fencing and intensive wildlife management practices. To describe spatial changes in the wildlife sector, the fences, camps, and intensive farm portions of wildlife properties in southwest Limpopo, South Africa, were mapped using remote sensing data from 2007, 2012 and 2017. A ground-truth study in 2019 confirmed the accuracy of the remotely-sensed maps. The number of camps smaller than 100 ha significantly increased, especially very small camps <50 ha, from 2007 to 2017. Over the ten-year period, farm portions became proportionately more intensive. This intensification resulted in an increased number of intensive farm portions within protected areas, critical biodiversity areas, and ecological support areas. An increase in total length of fences and number of camps, and a decrease in the mean size of camps were subsequently observed. These changes coincided with the rise of intensive breeding in the wildlife industry market between 2012 and 2017, after which this part of the sector declined. The increase in fencing and intensive management practices in southwest Limpopo could have implications for biodiversity conservation and planning. The remotely-sensed maps may help ensure sustainable wildlife management practices by aiding conservation policy frameworks and monitoring infrastructure developments.",

A century ago, the population size in the wild was estimated at >1 million. At present, there are ∼117 000 individuals remaining, of which 50% are in southern Africa. With substantial giraffe populations in the region, opportunities exist to re-introduce and establish founder populations in areas where they have become locally extinct. We assessed the potential for re-introducing Angolan giraffe (G. giraffa angolensis) into Iona National Park (NP), Angola, where they historically occurred. Our study investigated home range extent and preferred forage species of an Angolan giraffe population in northwest Namibia to assess the suitability of Iona NP for giraffe in terms of spatial requirements and food sources. Overall home ranges of giraffe in northwest Namibia were larger than in more temperate areas, an important aspect to consider when determining suitable habitat in Iona NP. Although arid riparian woodlands along ephemeral rivers formed the main habitat, the tagged animals moved independently of water and generally avoided human settlements. Species richness and diversity of giraffe forage species were encouragingly higher in Iona NP compared to northwest Namibia. We conclude that Iona NP is suitable with regard to available forage and size of habitat for the potential re-introduction of giraffe.",

    "abstract": "Cape francolins, Francolinus capensis, were reared in captivity from eggs of penned birds. Egg laying extended over eight months, but was erratic with a mean of 18,5 eggs per pen per season. Optimal production of fertile eggs was obtained with one pair per pen, and older birds tended to be more productive. Egg fertility was low (57,7%). Various chick-mortality factors resulted in a survival rate of only 22,3% to the age of nine months. Stress from crowded captive conditions was a possible primary cause of the high chick mortalities. Nine one-year-old males and 26 females were marked individually and released in an agricultural area directly after the breeding season of wild Cape francolins. Some dispersal for up to 3,8 km was observed, and a maximum of 40% survived the first three months in the 54 ha study area. Almost all of the birds died within six months, possibly from competition with wild francolins or an inability to adjust to natural conditions. No reproduction was observed in the captive-reared birds. It was concluded that supplementing wild populations with captive-reared birds could only have short-term benefits such as temporarily increased hunting opportunities.",

A total of 258 scats were collected in four mountainous areas, the Cedarberg near Clanwilliam, Gamka Mountain near Oudtshoorn, Jonkershoek near Stellenbosch, and Wemmershoek near Paarl. Dassies (rock hyrax) were found to be the most frequent prey in all areas except Wemmershoek, where feral domestic pigs were most often present in the scats. Small antelope were the next most important group, occurring in between 29% and 51% of the scats from each area. Small percentages of baboons, rodents, lagomorphs, reptiles, birds and insects were also recorded. Only two scats contained remains of domestic stock, which suggests that leopards in the higher mountains are able to subsist on the natural prey available.",

The density of 76–150-cm high shrubs accounted for 60% of the variation in the densities of the stick lodges of the dominant prey, Otomys unisulcatus. Densities of heuweltjies (raised soil mounds) accounted for 56% of the variation in the density of Parotomys brantsii warrens. Although young and non-breeding birds were found in all occupied vegetation types at the study site, attention was focused on Karroid Broken Veld since co-breeders were only found there. Karroid Broken Veld had heuweltjies and tall shrubs that were associated with both otomyines unlike other vegetation types that predominantly possessed only one of these characteristics. In this vegetation type, the high otomyine biomass (105 kg/km 2 ) in some years and the ability to exploit two otomyine populations provided the chanting-goshawks with prey choice and high energy returns. If the habitat structure that provides high-density refuge for two otomyines is unique to the study site, the reproductive fitness benefits to resident pale chanting-goshawks may have been pivotal in the evolution of families in this population.",

Twenty of 150 fingerlings collected from perennial ponds died on their way to the stocking ponds, and on bacteriological examination of their kidneys, livers and spleens, Aeromonas hydrophila (64.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.1%), Burkholderia cepacia (14.2%), Plesiomonas shigelloides (7.1%) and Acinetobacter anitratus (7.1%) were isolated. On re-inoculation of isolates of A. hydrophila into new fingerlings, 60% of the inoculated fish died. When oxytetracycline (31 mg/l) was added to water in which the fingerlings were transported, the mortality rate was reduced from 13.3% to 4.0%. It is recommended that the stocking of ponds with fingerlings scooped from the banks of rivers should be discontinued and that ponds should rather be stocked with fingerlings from hatcheries for which the brooding stock and bacterial profiles are known. Although the addition of oxytetracycline to water used for transporting fingerlings reduced the mortality rate, environmental considerations such as the possible emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria render this practice unacceptable.",

The main factors contributing to the decline in leopard distribution seem to be a combination of habitat destruction, human persecution, and prey depletion (Henschel et al. 2011). These activities have increased habitat fragmentation and can affect leopard behaviour through home range shifts and limited dispersal (Ngoprasert et al. 2007).\nLimited dispersal, and hindered gene flow, can decrease genetic variation and increase genetic differentiation in fragmented subpopulations due to inbreeding, genetic drift and selection (Haag et al. 2010). Lowered genetic diversity may in turn cause reduced survival and reproduction success because of increased accumulation of deleterious mutations and increased probabilities in allele loss (Whitlock 2000; Reed & Frankham 2003; Frankham et al. 2004).",

Millions of birds are thought to die annually this way, but calculating accurate fatality figures is extremely difficult (Drewitt & Langston, 2008). Fatality rates are normally estimated from periodic carcass searches, e.g. under representative sections of power line, but alone these can give misleading underestimates of true rates (Smallwood, 2007; Ponce, Alonso, Argandona, Fernandez & Carrassco, 2010). Several bias factors should be taken into account to allow for carcasses missed through removal by scavengers or decomposition (scavenger bias), varying levels of observer efficiency/different habitat types (search bias) and injured birds that die away from the search area (crippling bias; Bevanger, 1999).",

    "abstract": "Owing to a scarcity of larger natural wetlands, waterbirds are, in general, uncommon in Lesotho (Osborne & Tigar 1990; Bonde 1992; Hockey et al. 2005). Besides Anseriformes, the most characteristic species in this group are represented by Ciconiiformes and Pelecaniformes. In Lesotho, Reed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus), White-breasted Cormorant (Phalacrocorax lucidus), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), Black-headed Heron (Ardea melanocephala), Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea) and Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) have been recorded breeding (Osborne & Tigar 1990; Bonde 1992). Other members of Ciconiifomes, such as the Hamerkop (Scopus umbretta), Black Stork (Ciconia nigra) and Southern Bald Ibis (Geronticus calvus) are not regarded as waterbirds, but do breed in Lesotho (Osborne & Tigar 1990; Bonde 1992).\nFrom a conservation perspective, it is important and relatively easy to survey colonially breeding waterbirds, i.e. herons and cormorants. Since these colonies are occupied annually, their status can be monitored on a regular basis (Sutherland 1996, 2000). However, only the distribution and abundance of the Cattle Egret has been thoroughly investigated in Lesotho (Kopij 2008). The purpose of this study was to determine the status and distribution of all other herons and cormorants breeding in Lesotho.",

South Africa has recently signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (UNEP 1992). It is suggested that this should lead to the establishment of a collaborative national biodiversity body, and national strategy for the conservation of South Africa's biodiversity. The conservation of biodiversity is an outcome of the successful management of systems, but a national strategy will enhance such default conservation. Administrative changes that counter the problems of divided responsibilities and the duplication of efforts, are called for. Socio-economic considerations are considered pivotal to protection of biodiversity, and must be integrated into all strategies. There is a genuine commitment to the preservation of biodiversity on the part of these directors. The emphasis is at species level, and on large mammals, birds and plants. This needs to be expanded. The identification and monitoring of biodiversity in South Africa needs to be strengthened. Finances clearly constrain their efforts.",

    "abstract": "Effective monitoring programmes are critical to understand and mitigate declining wildlife populations. In South Africa, the majority of oribi antelope (Ourebia ourebi ourebi ) occur on private rangelands as broadly distributed and highly-fragmented populations. Thus, to effectively manage such a species, conservation organizations rely on citizen science-led conservation initiatives, whereby members of the public provide data on oribi population demographics and potential threats. Using these data, we estimated the total oribi population size and assessed the population trend of oribi in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, over a 14-year period (2001–2014). We found that the oribi population has declined by 30% over the 14 years. However, oribi population estimates were highly correlated with the number of returned survey forms. This relationship makes it difficult to accurately assess population trends and almost impossible to determine if any changes in conservation management have influenced oribi populations. Thus, issues associated with citizen science and data quality (i.e. participation levels), may limit the ability of the oribi census to accurately inform oribi conservation and management. We discuss the value and limitations of citizen science in oribi conservation with the ultimate goal of improving citizen-led oribi conservation.",

To investigate individually-specific responses of nyala antelopes (Tragelaphus angasii ) to vegetation greenness, we monitored the landscape use of eight telemetry-collared adult females, half at the wetter end and half at the drier end of Hluhluwe–iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We used remotely-sensed greenness as an index for plant productivity and data on canopy structure, and we compared the strength of selection for greenness between animals having different greenness averages within their home ranges. We found a decreasing pattern between home-range average greenness and strength of selection, which depended on season and presence of tree canopies. Animals in low-greenness home ranges tended to have stronger positive selection in closed-canopy vegetation in the dry season; those in high-greenness home ranges tended to have the stronger negative selection in open-canopy vegetation in the wet season. Our study emphasizes the possibility that a spatial resource gradient on a landscape might provide a valuable model of temporal change in a resource and an indication of potential for foraging animals to adapt to those changes.",

However, it is possible that other factors such as parasitism could be acting in synergy with drought and result in mortality. During the severe drought of 2009 in the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem in Kenya, 38 young elephants (5-8 years old) died. Necropsy of 11 fresh elephant carcasses revealed pathological lesions on the intestinal mucosa and haemorrhages which were linked to parasitism. A nematode, Grammocephalus clathratus, from the bile duct, a trematode, Protofasciola robusta, from the duodenum and a complex of unidentified nematodes from the lower gut were isolated from the elephants. The carcasses were overly emaciated and the intestinal system was devoid of digesta. It is likely that starvation and dehydration could have triggered a vicious cycle of host malnourishment, a result of combined inadequate food and nutritional deprivation by intestinal parasites which lead to emaciation, pathology and death.",

Black rhinoceros, Diceros bicornis minor, epitomizes these challenges. During October 2008 we used block surveys, estimates of availability and observer bias to calculate landscape-specific black rhino abundances in the southern parts of Kruger National Park, South Africa.We assigned age and sex to individuals, extracted an age distribution, and estimated survival and fecundity given the population growth derived from historical strip transects. The block counts, corrected for 90.3% availability bias with observers missing 3.8% of those, predicted that 627 (95% CI: 588-666) black rhinos resided in the study area. The population increased at 6.75% per annum, the result of high survival and an estimated inter-calving interval of 2.45 years. Age distributions and population growth predicts that sub-adult males and females have the lowest annual survival, while dependent calves and adults have the highest annual survival. Precise estimates can be obtained with a 20% study area coverage using block counts. This gives coefficient of variances allowing detection of 5% growth from surveys every two years. Detecting % annual decline requires bi-annual surveys for 6 years. Our results illustrate that black rhinos are performing well in Kruger National Park.",

This direct impact resulted in a total economic impact in the order of R774.3 million, and consequently, in a multiplier effect of 1.11.

Average age at independence was 17.5 months; females gave birth to their first litter of cubs at approximately 27.4 months and the average interbirth interval was 17.8 months. The average litter size at emergence was 4.2 and there was a significant difference between litter sizes at independence on reserves with lions (2.9 cubs) compared to those without (4.7 cubs). Age specific mortality was higher in the first four years of life (40-70%) than year five to nine (0%) and increased after year nine. Mortality of adult cheetahs was higher on reserves with lions compared to those without and there was a significant positive relationship (R2 = 0.56; P < 0.05) between cheetah mortality and the density of large predators on these reserves. We conclude that the reproductive rate of cheetahs that have been reintroduced to fenced reserves is high. Mortality of cubs and young adult cheetahs is elevated in the presence of lions and other carnivores. However, even under these conditions small reserves may serve as a source for cheetahs that can be used to re-stock other areas.",

Year round observations in Walvis Bay, Namibia of killer whales (2003 - 2010) by multiple marine tour operators and opportunistic seasonal observations of leatherback turtles made during a cetacean research project in the area (2008 - 2010) have been collated. Visits to coastal waters by killer whales (n = 16) are sporadic and unpredictable but are slightly higher (n = 11) between late winter (August) and late summer (March). Leatherback turtles were only seen in the warmer periods of summer months (February-March) when the surface waters exceeded 15°C. Two interactions (one harassment and one probably predation) between killer whales and leatherback turtles have been recorded in Walvis Bay. This is the first report of killer whales eating leatherback turtles in the South Atlantic. These observations are noteworthy due to the low frequency of encounters of both species in the area, suggesting predation of turtles may be relatively common. Knowledge of the diet of killer whales is valuable due to the importance of dietary specialization in definition of ecotypes of the species.",

    "abstract": "We surveyed bats at 30 localities in the Soutpansberg and Blouberg Mountains within the newly proclaimed Vhembe Biosphere Reserve (VBR) of northern South Africa, based on ANABAT acoustic recordings (63 nights) conducted in parallel with captures of 260 individuals from harp traps (29 trap-nights) and mist nets (54 trap-nights), and searches of ten day-roosts and two night-roosts. Twenty-four species of bats were captured, or positively identified from roosts, out of 44 species previously recorded for the VBR. For those species captured during the study and one additional commonly recorded species, Chaerephon ansorgei, which was not captured, we compiled a library of ANABAT call parameters for reference calls,based on released bats or bats emerging from known-species roosts. Reference calls were obtained from the study area where possible, or from the closest possible site in the savanna region of southeastern Africa. Using principal component analysis and plots of frequency histograms of selected parameters, we investigated the extent to which reference calls of different species could be distinguished on call parameters. Complete separation was obtained for most species but certain species-pairs or trios showed overlap, particularly amongst molossid bats. Accurate identification of unknown calls was complicated by natural intraspecific variation in echolocation call structure due to habitat and behaviour in our species-rich study area. We advocate a conservative approach whereby species-pairs or groups with overlapping calls are treated as single 'species'. Such underestimation can be partly corrected using rarefaction approaches, as illustrated by data collected from Blouberg Nature Reserve. Particularly when surveying bats in species-rich areas such as the eastern savannas of southern Africa, both acoustic and capture-based surveys are necessary to accurately estimate true species richness. From our capture data and roost searches,we recorded nine to 14 species at four west-east, grouped localities defined by this study. Adding acoustic data using a conservative approach to classify overlapping species-pairs or trios,we obtained minimum-richness estimates of 15 to 21 species, values which were close to those predicted by a recent macro-ecological model. We found no evidence for a west-east increase in richness with increasing precipitation as predicted by coarse-scale macroecological predictions.",

The first two, referring to the 'system' and the 'preamble' are an introduction to the basics of mammalian reproduction. They refer to mono- and polyoestry, sexual selection, social monogamy, polygamy and polyandry, territory, androgens and pheromones. Like the remainder of the book the focus is primarily oriented towards domestic species, particularly farm animals. I find this disappointing when the title of the book refers to an 'evolutionary perspective'. 'Mating males' may also infer a behavioural approach, although the main component of the book is concerned with anatomy and to a lesser extent physiology.",

We investigated the effects of sex and forage quality on defecation rate and faecal output in the common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia Linnaeus, 1758), a territorial species with limited sexual size dimorphism. Using a repeated measures design, ten semi-captive individuals of both sexes and two age classes were fed two diets differing in fibre content in two seasons. Dry matter intake and faecal output were measured over ten days on each diet. Neither diet quality nor fibre content significantly affected defecation rate or the dry matter of egesta, despite greater intake on a low-fibre diet. Daily dry matter intake and egestion did not differ significantly between sexes, but younger animals produced more faecal matter. Males defecated more frequently (5.2 ± 0.2 piles / day) than females (3.1 ± 0.1 piles / day). Prime males had the highest defecation rate and produced smaller dung piles than other categories. A significant inverse relationship between defecation rate and faecal pile mass was detected, and we suggest that territorial male common duikers control faecal output to maximize scent-mark distribution.",

Levels of genetic diversity are partly determined by the evolutionary history of a population and partly by environmental factors which affect population size, gene flow and mating systems. In this study, we used microsatellite DNA markers to assess the level of genetic diversity in a population of orange-breasted sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea), an endemic nectarivore in the fynbos biome at Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa. We found high levels of genetic diversity in this population, with an average of 19 alleles per locus, and both expected and observed heterozygosities of 0.84. The level of genetic diversity found in this species is comparable to that of Cape sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), a fellow fynbos endemic, but higher than that reported for other species of nectarivorous birds not affected by frequent habitat fires. We suggest that the destruction of flowering plants by fires, forcing birds to disperse, may have contributed to the maintenance of high levels of genetic diversity through encouraging outbreeding in orange-breasted sunbirds and Cape sugarbirds. We also discuss the implications of our findings for management of these species.",

The impact of this on the population ecology and long-term survival probability of this population has been unknown. This was largely due to a lack of basic population information. The results of a three-year intensive study from 1998 to 2001 into the population characteristics of Kgalagadi lions are presented. Kgalagadi lions exhibit similar population characteristics to most other lion populations and show little to no effect of anthropogenic mortality. Differences from other populations include exceptionally large home ranges (1462 ± 388 km2), which are however related to prey biomass. The adult sex ratio was more biased towards females than is typical, which is possibly a product of both ecological and anthropogenic influences. Cub survival is related to rainfall conditions and the number of adult lionesses in groups with cubs, but not to the number of adult males defending each pride. Owing to low prey abundance prides form stable subgroups typically containing two adult lionesses for long periods once cubs have reached one year of age. Kgalagadi lions show similar dispersal patterns to other lion populations with resident prey. Subadults in boundary prides suffer high mortality levels in response to livestock depredation. Males are more likely to become habitual livestock raiders,which ultimately leads to them being killed.",

In this study we used stable carbon isotope analyses of faeces to explore the seasonal dietary preferences of 11 bovid species from a West African savanna, the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve (PBR), along the browser/grazer (or C3/C4) continuum.We compare our carbon isotope values with those for eastern and southern African bovids, as well as with dietary predictions based on continent-wide averages derived from field studies. Oribi and reedbuck, expected to be grazers were found to be predominantly C3-feeders (browsers) in the PBR. Bushbuck, common duiker and red-flanked duiker consumed more C4 grass than reported in previous studies. When comparing wet and dry season diets, kob, roan and oribi showed the least variation in C3 and C4 plant consumed proportions, while red-flanked duiker, bushbuck, reedbuck and waterbuck showed the most marked shifts. This study shows that animals in the better-studied eastern and southern African savannas do not exhibit the full range of possible dietary adaptations. Inclusion of data from a wider geographical area to include less well-studied regions will inform our overall picture of bovid dietary ecology.",

On average adult males moved faster than females in all habitat types except when grouped together (then females moved at the faster male pace). Elephants demonstrated distinct movement patterns in different habitat types. All the movement parameters indicate that the elephants turned less the further they were from a large permanent body of water (Jozini Dam) and for males with increasing distance to the females. Male and female elephants turned more in habitat types that had favourable resources such as forage and shade, than they did in unfavourable habitats. Thus, the elephants used a direct movement strategy - turning less - when needing to get to a destination more quickly (e.g. toward water or mates), rather than significantly increasing their speed. It is hypothesized that these elephants are optimizing energy efficiency while still varying their foraging approach and search intensity. Patterns of movement through a habitat will affect ecological impacts in that habitat and so habitat-related movement pattern studies of this type could assist landscape planning (e.g. waterhole design and distribution) and large herbivore conservation.",

    "abstract": "The South African game farming industry has grown exponentially since the 1960s and makes a significant contribution to South Africa's GDP. Recently, a number of challenges to the sustainability of the industry have emerged. This has led to concerns by environmental NGOs, academics and government officials about land degradation, hybridization, inbreeding, disrupted ecosystem processes, social impacts, and economic feasibility. Game farmers have raised concerns about the industry's governance, in particular the lack of consultation, inconsistent regulation, lack of capacity and leadership, and indecisiveness in government. The root of the problem lies in the incorrect and untested assumption that current science, policy and governance systems are adequate to achieve the goals of sustainability, leading to a top-down approach to regulation and the absence of adaptive management and co-learning. In this paper, we outline the ecological, social and economic benefits of sustainable game farm management. We propose an alternative approach to responsible management and better governance, based on the principles of adaptive co-management and co-regulation. We put forward a learning-and-process model starting with knowledge generation, awareness raising, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, policy adaptation, monitoring and, ultimately, assessment and certification. The process moves from ineffective regulation to co-regulation, and the capacity to govern as well as the ecosystem's capacity to produce lasting services increases steadily as the process evolves. We suggest that the process outlined in the model should be guided by independent facilitators and culminate in a certification system for sustainably managed game farms.",

    "abstract": "The rehabilitation of orphaned animals is commonly practiced but rarely scientifically documented. The behavioural development before release (e.g. regarding hunting skills) is particularly important for ensuring animals are self-sustaining after release. We document the rehabilitation and release of three confiscated cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs and one leopard (Panthera pardus) cub, which were taken from the wild in Botswana. The animals were raised with minimal human contact and the development of their hunting skills was observed and assisted by limited pre-release training. After release, all animals were monitored and data showed they successfully hunted, with behavioural patterns similar to wild conspecifics. All established stable home ranges at the release site. Home ranges of the cheetahs ranged from 44 to 121 km2, travelling primarily during the early morning and evening, ranging from 4.5 to 9.4 km/day. While the leopard survived and probably reproduced within a stable home range (449km2), all three cheetahs were shot within 7 months of release. Therefore, although orphaned large felids can successfully hunt after release using appropriate rehabilitation techniques, they face the same human-carnivore conflicts of their wild counterparts. Our study demonstrates the indispensable but commonly neglected need for post-release monitoring in wildlife rehabilitation.",

Growing evidence suggests that protected populations are declining, including the breeding C. niloticus population at Lake Sibaya in KZN. Aerial surveys were conducted at Lake Sibaya from 2003 - 2004 and 2007 - 2009, spotlight counts in 2003 and intensive nesting surveys in 2003 and 2004. Seven adults were counted during the 2009 aerial survey; an 89% decrease from the 1985 count (62 adults) and a decline of 95-98% of the estimated 1970 adult population. Likewise, in 1970 30 nests were recorded, compared to three nests in 2003 and no recorded nests in 2004. The non-hatchling population in 2003 was estimated at 48 individuals and decreased to an estimated eight in 2009. The neighbouring community perceives crocodiles as a threat to their lives and livestock, and increasing human pressures on C. niloticus in the area will probably ensure that the population will not recover naturally. Unless crocodiles are perceived as a useful or somehow beneficial natural resource by the surrounding community,the species faces possible extirpation from Lake Sibaya in the future.",

However, when interventions result in severe changes to predator prey dynamics, learning from these outcomes can assist in informing future interventions. In small to medium-sized fenced reserves both predator and prey can adjust their behaviour rapidly following interventions. We used lion (Panthera leo) and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) interventions (lion introduction and buffalo translocation) in the Addo Elephant National Park to investigate the response of the buffalo-lion dynamic in the park. Responses did not conform to our expectations for either lions or buffalo. Rather than dominate the remaining solitary male lion, the introduced coalition split, with one of the introduced male lions (known to hunt buffalo successfully where it originated) joining with the remaining solitary male. Following fragmentation as a result of the buffalo translocation, previously large buffalo herds failed to re-form. These two outcomes resulted in a significant increase in buffalo predation primarily by the newly formed coalition of males, with the majority of buffalo killed originating from splintered herds rather than male-dominated groups as is conventionally found in large ecosystems. Ultimately, management actions can enable us to learn by monitoring the consequences of interventions, allowing us to implement what we have learned in an adaptive management framework.",

We searched historical records and found details of four observations of leopard seals along the coast of South Africa since 1946. All of these sightings were of juvenile animals.

    "abstract": "The ability of cats (Felis catus) to colonize most land habitats worldwide led to an increasing number of feral cat populations in many areas where food resources are easily available. High densities of feral cats in urban areas, particularly in conservancies, have the potential to impact negatively on both human and local wildlife populations. Of particular interest was the Howard College Campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, a registered conservancy where there are differing opinions concerning the resident feral cat population. Consequently methods of controlling feral cat populations and the implications of these methods were reviewed. Despite various methods of feral cat population control existing there are two basic categories : either eradication or reproductive regulation. It is suggested that to control the feral cat population effectively in this urban conservancy, a suitable and ongoing sterilization programme, that is run in conjunction with a feral cat feeding programme,needs to be implemented. Both programmes need to be long-term and overseen by management. The feral cat population needs to be maintained at a level that allows the lowest migration rate into the conservancy, as well as a predation rate that will not negatively affect the resident wildlife populations. This may require some removal of feral cats at the start of a programme. Whatever management actions are followed, a monitoring programme must be put in place to document how effective the actions are.",

Mean body and carcass weight did not differ (P > 0.05) between either seasons or genders. However, dressing percentage was higher (P 0.05) between seasons, whereas differences (P < 0.05) in temperature of carcasses measured 24 h post-mortem could be ascribed to differences in ambient temperature. Meat from animals harvested during spring (5.52 and 39.63%) had a higher (P ≤0.05) drip and cooking loss compared to those harvested in winter (2.27 and 34.59%) and autumn (3.61 and 33.88%). Meat was the most (P < 0.05) tender during autumn (2.27 kg/1.27cm diameter) while that of females was more tender than the males. The colour of the meat was darker in winter (L*-value of 28.90) compared to spring (34.08) and autumn (32.91). Protein content of the m. longissimus dorsi was lowest (P < 0.05) in spring (20.45%). Lipid content was highest (P < 0.05) in winter (1.22%) and also lowest (P < 0.05) in males (0.90). Although season has significant influences on some physical and chemical characteristics of meat from the black wildebeest, the extent of these differences does not necessitate a different classification system.",

Breeding and feeding records of a Verreauxs' eagle (Aquila verreauxii), pair in the garden were analysed in relation to changes in the local environment due to urbanization. Natural prey-suitable habitat within a 10 km radius of the nest diminished by approximately 29.7 km2 (9.5%) during 1984-2007. In 2007 approximately 116.7 km2 (37.2%) of suitable prey habitat remained within this radius. Feeding data within a more recent period (1996-2008) suggest that there has been a switch from an optimal diet of rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) to less characteristic avian prey species such as helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), francolins (Francolinus spp.) and supplemented food. Annual breeding success indicated few inconsistencies in incubation period, nestling period and postfledging dispersal period relative to breeding Verreauxs' eagle elsewhere. Despite a reduction in the suitable prey habitat and change in prey composition (including supplemental feeding), breeding has persisted successfully over a 16-year period (1993-2008). The presence of a large apex avian predator in an extensively urbanized metropolis is encouraging with regard to ecological integrity and functioning but the future prospects for these Verreauxs' eagles may depend on an as yet unknown threshold of prey abundance, both natural and supplemented, and environmental disturbance.",

We present the first quantitative assessment of the Robben Island rabbit population. Population estimates should be treated cautiously because of methodological biases, but were useful for identifying trends. Rabbit numbers fluctuated seasonally but were relatively stable between October 2003 and November 2005. Following a programme in 2006 to eradicate feral domestic cats (Felis catus), there was an apparent increase in the rabbit population and the highest estimate of rabbits was made in November 2008. By February 2009, rabbit numbers had decreased considerably and this was probably due to reduced food availability following the 2008 population explosion. Nevertheless, during 2009 rabbit numbers remained higher than they had ever been before November 2008. Rabbits usually preferred open-range habitat, but switched to transitional habitat when numbers were high. Single-species eradication programmes could have devastating impacts on the island's ecosystem. It is thus recommended that a thorough risk assessment be carried out and a holistic management strategy, rather than a single-species approach, be formulated.",

This is particularly so in northeastern Namibia where an extensive network of rivers and wetlands coupled with successful conservation measures has allowed crocodile populations to flourish since uncontrolled exploitation ended over three decades ago. This area is predominantly communal land characterized by numerous subsistence communities dependent on river and wetland resources. In recent years, the combination of a growing human population and resurgent crocodile populations has resulted in considerable conflict between humans and crocodiles. The principle objective of this study was to quantify the impact of crocodiles on rural livelihoods. Data were obtained from existing records and through community surveys on the lower Kavango, Chobe and Kwando rivers and upper Zambezi River. Existing estimates suggest an annual loss of ~ 255 domestic cattle per year for northeastern Namibia whilst community survey estimates suggest a substantially greater annual loss of ~ 6864 cattle per year. Community surveys also revealed conflict between crocodiles and artisinal fishermen, with an estimated 71 500 fishing nets damaged by crocodiles per year. Human-crocodile conflict in Namibia may have greater impacts than previously assumed, and may undermine conservation and development objectives.",

Within two months of release, seven of the 10 oribi were dead. The causes of mortality varied, but predation by natural predators and humans was a major factor. Consequently no further reintroductions on to this property were advised.

Conventional hunting employs the principles of fair chase and usually consists of hunting on foot during the day. The purpose of this study was to compare the meat quality of the impala (Aepyceros melampus) shot utilizing these two methods. No significant differences in pH45 or pHu were found between the two methods. An exponential decay model (y = a + b-ct) was fitted to the pH data and conventionally hunted animals showed significantly higher rates of pH decline (c = -0.385 ± 0.022 units per hour) than night-cropped animals (c = -0.184 ± 0.019 units per hour) - a phenomenon that may be linked to the ante-mortem stress experienced by the animals, and the cooling rate of the carcasses. Impala conventionally hunted also had significantly higher constants for the pH exponential model (a = 5.424 ± 0.039; b = 1.405 ± 0.034) than the night-cropped impala (a = 5.295 ± 0.033; b = 1.556 ± 0.029).

GPS units are advantageous compared to other methods of remote tracking of animals in that the have the ability to gather large quantities of spatial data that may be accessed remotely. However, animal behaviour, topography, vegetation, and seasonality could all influence GPS acquisition success and therefore bias results from GPS technology. Here we analyse temporal and seasonal patterns associated with GPS acquisition failures in five GPS collars fitted to leopards (Panthera pardus) in the Waterberg region of South Africa. Of 6565 attempted GPS acquisitions, 19% (1236) failed with the location failure rate of individual collars ranging from 15-29%. Single failed attempts accounted for the majority of location failures, suggesting that failure was caused by temporary blockage to satellites. Failure rates were significantly higher during the day and there were indications that they were higher during the wet season than in the dry season. Failures were also clustered in space for some individual animals. Our results suggest that temporal patterns of animal behaviour and habitat choice influence the probability of GPS location failures in this species. We therefore suggest that potential biases should be accounted for when using GPS data to analyse movement and habitat selection in this and similar carnivore species.",

The gemsbok milk contained 4.4 ± 1.5 g/kg oligosaccharide, which is four times higher than that found in other ruminants. The milk of the eland and kudu contained significantly lower levels of saturated fatty acids than that of the gemsbok, the levels being respectively, 62.55 ± 3.61, 69.70 ± 1.62 and 79.46 ± 0.84%, due to the saturated acids of 8-14 carbon chain lengths. When adding the milk composition of sable antelope from the literature, statistical analysis (PCA) showed a difference between the milk composition of the subfamilies Hippotraginae and Bovinae (tribe Tragelaphini), suggesting phylogenetic effects. Observations on the composition of milk from scimitar oryx, lechwe, okapi and southern pudu are also reported.",

    "abstract": "The recent increase in habitat fragmentation across our continents calls for concern with regard to the future survival of wildlife. In this respect corridors and stepping-stones are important. Targeting a wide-ranging top-trophic carnivore, the aim of this study was to estimate the density and abundance of leopards (Panthera pardus) in an area that might serve as a stepping-stone between other larger protected areas. We deliberately used a survey method designed to balance resource utilization and relevance of the results to fit the purpose of a pilot survey. The Sangare Ranch Conservancy is a newly established, privately owned park in Kenya. Using non-invasive techniques we identified 13 individual leopards composing of approximately 80% males. In addition,we found 28 leopard signs per 100 km walked, a predicted carrying capacity of around nine leopards/100 km2 and a leopard predation pressure on neighboring goat stock of 5.6%. We suggest that the conservancy plays an important role for leopard ecology and comprises a geographical and ecological stepping-stone between other protected wild habitats in the region. The study also suggests more efficient methods for future non-invasive studies.",

Transects were conducted throughout the fenced, temperate coastal indigenous forested reserves of Dwesa and Cwebe to detect sign (observations, footprints, faeces) of medium and large mammals, and evidence of poaching (snares, human footprints, bullet cartridges). I used generalized linear models of relative abundance data to identify the most likely causes of population decline and presence / absence data to identify the most likely causes of local extinction. Two of the largest mammals (white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum and eland, Tragelaphus oryx, were the only species that had distance to the reserve boundary (and hunting humans) as the most important factors affecting their distribution; however, three other ungulates avoided humans (avoided reserve boundary or roads). Highly unusual habitat use (forest restriction) was observed for several normally grassland inhabitants, illustrating the perceived risks associated with open habitats. This study illustrates that bushmeat hunting is not a threat restricted to the Third World tropics and that conservation areas require monitoring, as well as fencing, to ensure poaching does not threaten wildlife.",

We investigated the anatomy of jugular valves in giraffes to establish if they could prevent either of these regurgitations. Jugular vein length and intervalve distances of 396 valves (192 left, 204 right) were measured in 60 veins from 25 adult (11 males and 14 females) and five foetal giraffes. The average number of valves in the left jugular veins was 6.4 ± 2.7 (mean ± S.D.; range = 2-13) and in the right was 6.8 ± 2.1 (range = 3-12). Male giraffes had 7.3 ± 2.7, females 5.9 ± 2.1, and foetuses 7.0 ± 2.1 valves per vein. None of these differences was statistically significant (t-test; P > 0.05). Most valves (88%) were bicuspid in structure. Their position in the veins was irregular. Most (36.1%) were located in the first 500mm of vein. The relative distribution of foetal valves was not significantly different from that in adult giraffes (X2 = 0.274, P > 0.05). We concluded that the main function of the jugular vein valves is to prevent regurgitation of blood from the inferior vena cava and right atrium into the jugular vein and that the number of valves is fixed in utero.",

Samples were collected in the Niokolo Koba National Park, the refuge of the last wild population, and in the Bandia wildlife reserve, where the animals foraged on natural and supplementary food.Leaves, shoots ofwoody plants,and fruits were the three major components at both sites. They formed 98.8% of diet volume in the wild and 77.5% in the Bandia Reserve where supplementary food reduced the consumption of natural components but maintained the total content of major components together with supplement at 99.2%. Other components such as forbs and grasses appeared in low proportions, generally below 5% of the mean volume. Leaves of Boscia angustifolia, Grewia bicolor, Hymenocardia acida, and Ziziphus mauritiana, and fruits of Acacia spp. and Strychnos spinosa were identified as part of the diet in the wild. In the Bandia Reserve, the proportions of diet components did not differ between males and females, but there were differences in consumption of supplementary food between age classes. The results indicate that in the dry season the western Derby eland behaves as a pure browser, consuming grasses in negligible amounts. Consequently, woody savanna habitat is necessary for future conservation enclosures to ensure adequate natural forage resources for animals and thus to avoid food supplementing that presents a risk of dietary shifts in animals in captivity.",

We collated all age assignment criteria and found that a constraint of most objective criteria is that they require immobilized or dead specimens to measure. Furthermore, nearly all criteria used lions with assumed ages to construct relationships or narrative descriptions. We show that digital photogrammetry provides digitally-derived measures of shoulder heights similar to that of linearly derived measures. In addition, such shoulder heights did not differ between captive and free ranging lions, or between different regions in Africa. Variation in shoulder height is primarily associated with sex-specific age. Age, using the von Bertalanffy growth curve, explained 92% and 97% of the variation in female and male shoulder height, a skeletal measure not strongly affected by resource availability. Simulations suggest that age assignment is relatively accurate for females and males with shoulder heights up to 70 cm and 95 cm, respectively. Thus for lions younger than two years of age objective criteria gives most precise estimates, while subjective criteria are more suitable for older lions.",

Day-cropped animals had higher mean behavioural scores (perceived amount of ante-mortem stress experienced) and cortisol levels (behavioural score = 3.0 ± 0.641; cortisol = 68 ± 1.28 nmol/l) than night-cropped animals (behavioural score = 1.8 ± 0.955; cortisol = 14 ± 2.15 nmol/l).

No differences were found between the treatments for any of the colour ordinates, except L* values (day-cropped: 33.45 ± 0.435; night-cropped = 32.13 ± 0.601). The results of this study are inconclusive in that although day-cropped animals experienced more ante-mortem stress and, as a result produced meat with higher drip loss, they had a lower shear force and a paler colour, which are positive meat quality attributes associated with less stress.",

This can lead to confusion in the conservation policy and management of protected areas because it is uncertain where it might be appropriate to reintroduce or conserve the species. The problem is confounded because the recorded information is summarized in two sources that are hard to access. This information is examined and discussed. It shows that, historically, living crocodiles were seen or killed on the coast as far south as 32°18'S; 28°50'E, in the Dwesa State Forest, Eastern Cape, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, there are museum specimens of skulls and teeth collected from localities farther south, between the mouths of the Keiskamma and the Keurbooms Rivers. These are probably of widely different ages, but older than the historical era beginning in the 16th century. There is no information on their geological or archaeological provenance. This suggests that the species' range limits expanded and contracted at least once through approximately 2° of latitude before the historical period. The former government of Transkei reintroduced the species to the Dwesa-Cwebe Nature Reserve in c. 1980. There is no evidence to suggest that it would be appropriate to reintroduce crocodiles south or westward of this population.",

Years of civil unrest in Angola, a highly localized distribution and interbreeding with its congener the roan antelope (H. equinus) has led to this subspecies being considered as critically endangered. Sable antelope occurring ∼600 km to the east in western Zambia superficially resemble giant sable in phenotype, prompting speculation in the popular media that the distribution of giant sable may be larger than currently documented. Our aim here was to investigate the evolutionary placement of western Zambian sable using mitochondrial DNA control region data. Phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses) supported the monophyly of H. n. variani (Bayesian posterior probability of <0.95, bootstrap support <80%) and nested the western Zambian sable within H. n. niger. This finding was supported by an analysis of molecular variance that discretely grouped western Zambian sable from giant sable (ΦST = 0.645,P = 0.001). Significant genetic structure was also found across the range of H. n. niger as indicated by our phylogenetic analyses and analysis of molecular variance (ΦST = 0.418, P = 0.001). We conclude that although the western Zambian sable antelope and those of H. n. variani resemble one another in morphology, particularly with respect to facial markings, significant genetic differences underpin these two evolutionary lineages. Our findings hold implications for the conservation of sable and highlight the need for active management intervention.",

There has been much debate on the conservation status and management needs for leopards with much extrapolation from limited data. In order to gather more information on leopard movements in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve, seven leopards were collared between February 2005 and August 2006. This allowed key aspects that affect demography, and thus resilience to anthropogenic effects, to be investigated. Generally, home ranges were typical for breeding females in woodland savanna (32.9 ± 7.3 km2) with substantial overlap (average 26.0%). Core areas though were independent and extremely small (1.9 ± 2.2 km2). These were used primarily for young cub rearing, and were characterized by rugged terrain along riverbeds. This highly localized use places leopards at potential risk of snaring as snares tend to be concentrated along these landscape features. Furthermore, hunters can conceal blinds from which to shoot leopards more easily in these areas. Further risk to adult female survival came from excursions outside the reserve boundary during which livestock was predated. Three incidences of cannibalism by adult territorial males on adult females are also reported, suggesting significant intra-specific competition.",

Group composition varied considerably over the annual cycle, and was linked to reproductive status. Mixed-sex groups began to form during February, lasted until October, and were most frequent during mid winter (July). During the lactation period (Oct-Jan), females formed maternity colonies composed of lactating females and juveniles. Three kinds of leaf tubes were identified according to the size of the opening: small (0-20 mm), medium-sized (21-115 mm) and large (115 mm-unfolded leaf). Bats occupied mainly medium-sized leaf tubes. Average daily temperatures were high, even during the winter period (Jun-Aug), with humidity in the leaf tubes > 80% throughout the year. Although high humidity may play a role during hibernation to restrict dehydration, low ambient temperatures are important to sufficiently lower their body temperatures in order to lower metabolic rate and thus reduces energy requirements.",

In South Africa they were once listed as vermin in the old Cape Province due to their high population numbers and impact on grazing. However, about 10 years ago, populations in the KwaZulu-Natal province became locally extinct. This resulted in the recent reintroductions of rock hyraxes, purchased at annual wildlife auctions in the province. Success of these reintroductions was unknown as there had been no post-release monitoring. This study determined the success of reintroducing rock hyraxes, using two source populations, namely rock hyraxes that had been in captivity for 16 months (n = 17) and those from the wild (n = 9). Captive rock hyraxes did not have site fidelity after release and after three months could not be found. All wild rock hyraxes, except one whose fate is unknown, were found dead within 18 days of release. One had an accidental death while the rest were preyed upon. In conclusion, the reintroduction of captive and wild rock hyraxes likely failed due to predation. This may have been a consequence of group disintegration, probably as a result of incorrect group composition, captive stress, and type of release. Suggestions to improve the success of future rock hyrax reintroductions are provided.",

Because sampling intensities may influence precision, we simulated survey intensities to determine which could yield accurate and precise population estimates and detect population changes for several African elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations. Simulated surveys of hypothetical elephant populations had to cover 5-20% of a study area to yield accurate estimates, but this depended on how density and distribution varied. Precise estimates, however, needed survey intensities greater than 50%. In addition, the detection of typical rates of population change needed greater sampling intensities than those currently used for most elephant surveys. Survey intensity plays an important role in estimating the accuracy and precision of population estimates and the detection of population trends. Population managers should consider existing information on population density, distribution, and survey intensity to design aerial surveys that will yield both accurate and precise estimates.",

    "abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry provides data to study spatial utilization patterns of animals. Spatial uncertainty due to poor accuracy and fix rates, however, may detract from inferences based on such data. The exclusion of two-dimensional (2D) locations may improve such inferences, but the prevalence of 2D locations may be a factor of landscape properties. In trials conducted using GPS units stationed at known positions, fix rate decreased significantly with increased canopy cover, but was unaffected by slope. Most (75%) of the locations recorded in closed woodland were 2D locations, suggesting that the exclusion of 2D locations may reduce estimates of the utilization of such habitats. Excluding 2D locations from records obtained for GPS units deployed on free-ranging elephants (Loxodonta africana) increased daily displacement distances, and changed the number of locations per habitat. However, selection ratios and estimates of home range area were not influenced by filtering location data. We concluded that although the exclusion of 2D locations improved the accuracy of locations per se, it resulted in significant data loss. This loss could alter inferences on patterns of spatial utilization.",

As part of a larger study, shore-based observations were made in a small bay (~1000 m wide) in the Western Cape, South Africa, during the summer months of 1999-2001 to gather data on their nearshore movements and behaviour. Heaviside's dolphins exhibited a diurnal onshore-offshore migration and the sighting rate varied significantly with time of day and brightness of the moon, with numbers being markedly higher before 12:00 and nearer a full moon. These patterns were presumed to be linked to the vertical migration of their principal prey, juvenile hake Merluccius species and Heaviside's dolphins appeared to be resting and not feeding inshore during the day. Sightings of dusky dolphin showed no predictable variation with time of day but their numbers inshore were significantly lower when upwelling conditions existed offshore. Larger groups of Heaviside's dolphins (especially groups of four) were more active (leaps, etc.) than smaller groups,but behaviour was not linked to environmental factors. The dissimilar responses to environmental conditions suggest that sympatry in these two species is mediated by niche as well as prey differentiation.",

A resident population of feral cats (Felis catus) resides on campus. There are two opposing views about these animals; one is that,by killing birds, lizards and small mammals,they negatively affect native wildlife, another is that management efforts, such as feeding and sterilization, minimize predation on wildlife and control cat numbers. The outcome of this debate is crucial in developing long-term management goals for the campus Conservancy. This study represents an assessment of stakeholder perceptions regarding the feral cat population. Participants observed feral cats in areas with feeding stations. Feeding was the main activity observed. Feelings towards the cats were generally positive. There was strong opposition to the eradication of the entire population; respondents did not consider feral cats an invasive alien species, rather a benign exotic species. The management implications of these findings are significant and these views should be considered in developing a management strategy. Further research should explore the use of feeding stations and sterilization, but additional research is necessary to determine the impact of feral cats on wildlife in and around the Conservancy.",

Using a power analysis approach, we assessed the performance of three established methods (diurnal, nocturnal and indirect dung surveys) in producing density estimates for the blue and the Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus monticola, Cephalophus ogilbyi ogilbyi) in a 16 km2 section of primary forest, systematically sampled using line transects. Direct survey methods (diurnal and nocturnal) yielded density estimates between 8.3 and 6.8 (blue duiker) and 6.5 and 4.3 animals/ km2 (Ogilby's). The coefficients of variation of density estimates implied a resolution of 44% density change detectable in diurnal surveys but only of 140% in nocturnal surveys. Density estimates derived from the dung survey were lower than those of direct surveys (1.5 animals/km2 and 1.4 animals/km2, respectively). Associated coefficients of variation imply a resolution of change in density estimates detectable for changes far larger than 100%. However, dung pile density was susceptible to variation in key parameters (decay and production rates) and difficulties in data acquisition lead us to reject the dung survey as a suitable method in our particular setting. Our results suggest that diurnal direct surveying from line transects can be reliable and effective even for shy forest ungulates under (some) hunting pressure.",

Differential passage rates of prey species were not pronounced. Observed passage rates were used to devise a sampling protocol for scats collected during a field study where scats were separated by a minimum period of 120 hours to ensure independence of samples. Comparison of the percentage occurrence of prey species in field-collected scats with the percentage occurrence from direct observations of kills illustrated the tendency for small prey to be underrepresented in the latter. However, the strong correlation between percentage occurrences in diet as determined by the two methods (rs = 0.85, P < 0.01, 13 d.f.) suggests that both methods can reliably determine the relative importance of prey in the diets of obligate carnivores such as wild dogs.The determination of maximum passage rates and subsequent guidelines for collection of independent faecal samples in the field could be a valuable tool for reducing inherent biases in carnivore diet studies.",

Thirty two lions were immobilized, half of which (16) received one of the two drug combination protocols, respectively. Seven quantitative and three subjective categories of data that were compared showed little overall difference in the quality of anaesthesia. However, use of the ancillary drug (detomidine) originally developed for sedation in domestic horses resulted in cost savings of up to five times over the one developed for domestic carnivores (medetomidine). Keeping drug costs down helps to lower the high cost of wild animal immobilizations and is thus particularly useful when routine or frequent capture is required. Short-acting reversible anaesthetics are much preferable in free-ranging situation for short-duration procedures to avoid prolonged recoveries previously experienced with non-reversible alternative anaesthetic agents (tiletamine-zolazepam).",

The questionnaire's aims were to evaluate in both a descriptive and quantitative manner the utilization of wood in building construction. House building design in that community has abandoned the traditional round huts with thatched roofs of 20 years ago and now favours square or rectangular houses made with wooden walls covered with mud or cement and with a corrugated iron roof. While wooden houses represented the majority of buildings, houses made of bricks were on the increase. Square or rectangular houses with a corrugated iron roof required significantly less elements for the roof beams than round thatched houses. The wall panels were the most wood-consuming part of a house. It was estimated that the average household would have to source 11 main posts, 10 main beams, 27 roof laths and 277 wall laths annually to replace old buildings. Between 40 and 50% of the material used in house building was obtained from species with an established sustainable harvesting potential. The high preference for Brachylaena huillensis as main posts is, however,cause for concern as the current population of this species in the communal land of the Manqakulane people cannot sustain such high levels of harvesting.",

The number of grasshopper genera and species of butterflies and birds was greatest at the low-altitude locality, and least at the high-altitude locality (except for birds). Most montane endemics were recorded at both the mid-altitude and high-altitude localities. The method distinguished between localities in terms of species composition, taxon richness and endemicity, and therefore could be used during a wildlife conservation evaluation of that region. However, species composition and the patterns of taxon richness and endemicity along the altitude gradient differed somewhat from those found in the Maclear district, southern Drakensberg region.

    "abstract": "This paper reviews our knowledge of the population dynamics of the four species of southern African sandgrouse and critically evaluates issues related to the sustainability of hunting and the appropriateness of current institutional frameworks for managing sandgrouse. The lack of comprehensive data on annual recruitment and adult survival hampers our ability to manage sandgrouse in an informed manner. The relatively low reproductive potential of sandgrouse, their susceptibility to over-exploitation and the possibility that population regulation in some species may be largely density independent suggests that a cautious approach to management is warranted. Managers should note that most sandgrouse species breed through the winter months, the traditional hunting season. The implications of a perceived decline in South African Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua) populations, due to high levels of nest predation on core breeding grounds, are discussed. The movement patterns of sandgrouse (some species are largely sedentary whereas others are highly nomadic and partially migratory) will influence the effectiveness of different management frameworks. It is argued that the present state-controlled system, based on the concept of res nullius, is not entirely appropriate for the management of sedentary species. Successful management of particularly the highly mobile Namaqua sandgrouse will likely depend on the extent to which resource users and conservation agencies can collaborate and share responsibilities for management.",

    "abstract": "A database of approximately 9000 trophy measurements of ungulates hunted in South Africa between 1993 and 2001 was analysed in order to detect species-specific, regional variation in mean trophy quality. Blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas), eland (Taurotragus oryx), impala (Aepyceros melampus), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula) and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) showed statistically significant variation in trophy quality. A number of other species including blue wildebeest (Connochaetus taurinus), black wildebeest (Connochaetus gnou), bushbuck (Tragelaphus angusticeps), common reedbuck (Redunca redunca), gemsbok (Oryx gazella), red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) and waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) were insignificant. The manipulation of trophy quality on ranches is speculated to be the major cause of these significant regional variations. It is recommended that species-specific baselines of trophy quality and associated levels of 'acceptable manipulation' be established and incorporated into a national trophy quality monitoring programme to provide some level of protection to an industry that contributes significantly to the South African economy.",

    "abstract": "Here we studied the the diet and habitat use of buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) on Doornkloof Nature Reserve (DNR) in the Nama-Karoo, South Africa. The buffalo were predominantly grazers. Only seven grass species formed the bulk of their diet and marked seasonal shifts were observed in the contribution of these species to the diet of buffalo. Eragrostis lehmanniana and Sporobolus fimbriatus formed most of the food eaten in the wet seasons but contributed little to the diet in the dry season. By contrast, T. triandra contributed little to the diet in the wet seasons but formed the bulk of the diet in the dry season. This pattern appears to be related to the distribution of and to the seasonal changes in the acceptability of these grass species to buffalo. In the wet seasons the buffalo mainly foraged in the lowland habitats adjacent to riverine thickets containing E. lehmanniana and S. fimbriatus which were favoured by buffalo at this time. This pattern changed in the dry season when the buffalo ranged further from the cover of the riverine thicket and moved through the lowland habitats into the upland habitats where Themeda triandra, which was favoured in the dry season, was abundant. The favourable nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations recorded in buffalo feacal samples on DNR suggests that buffalo are likely to perform well in this environment and the population growth appears to confirm this.",

The income generated by hunting tourism, and the distribution of this income, are analysed using a recently developed Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). In aggregate, an extra N$ in spending by survey respondents translates into approximately one extra N$ in national income, and an average survey respondent's spending raised overall national income by an amount corresponding to two to three years' income for an average Namibian. The additional income generated by hunting tourism and associated tourism benefits rural households and urban wage earners to a greater extent, and capital owners to a lesser extent, than the average income distribution in the economy.",

However, a limitation of the present dataset is that mother / pup relatedness cannot be examined because pups are only tagged after their tagged mothers have abandoned them. We test the usefulness of two different temporary marking techniques (tagging and 'strapping'), and four different marker types over two consecutive breeding seasons for use on pups with attending marked mothers. We show that strapping is an ineffective way to mark unweaned southern elephant seals. By comparison, 'Supersmall®' Dalton plastic tags allow quick, effective and easy marking of large numbers of pups with known mothers, without excessive marker loss.",

The need to assess the financial implication of such a switch arose from the question of whether game ranching is financially superior to cattle farming in this province. Comparative economics was used in this case study to analyse the profitability, as well as the financial feasibility of three scenarios to determine the financial implications of such a switch. Estimations were based primarily on hunting (biltong and trophy) and live game auctions, the two pillars of the game industry in this province. Results indicate that game ranching can be more profitable, i.e. generate a higher gross margin per hectare than cattle, although not in all cases. Despite this higher profitability, the results indicate further that it is not always financially viable to convert from cattle farming to game ranching, due to the high level of capital investment required. This may have tremendous cash flow implications for the first few years of operation.",

Spermatozoa remained present in the caudae epididymides throughout August. Mating was initiated in May and ovulation and fertilization occurred at the beginning of August. Implantations first occurred during early August and parturition followed from late October to the end of November. Lactating females were found until mid January. In contrast to the same species in Malawi, it appears that in Mpumalanga no sperm storage takes place in females and occurs for only a short period in males.

The Sand Forest vegetation is the most valuable vegetation type in this region due to the endemics it harbours, but it is currently under threat from growing animal population densities within conserved areas and from a growing human population outside. To improve our understanding of Sand Forest dynamics the present study investigated the woody plant assemblages in Tembe Elephant Park. A total of 59 plots were sampled and analysed using classification and ordination methods. The results indicate that Sand Forest in Tembe is a complex assemblage of at least three floristically and structurally distinct woody communities. An ordination of the combined results from the present study together with two other studies could link the floristics and structure of the Sand Forest to the level of disturbance by herbivores and humans. Large herbivores induce both structural and floristic changes in the Sand Forest of Tembe Elephant Park and a lack of disturbance in the nearby Tshanini Community Conservation Area leads to a state of equilibrium. The results therefore suggest that Sand Forest dynamics and complexity may be strongly linked to small- to medium-scale animal disturbance.",

The mean live weights of ten male (28.58 kg) and nineteen female (30.58 kg) mountain reedbuck did not differ (P > 0.05),and the mean cold carcass weight was 16.36 kg for both genders. Gender had no influence (P > 0.05) on any of the physical characteristics (pH, drip loss, cooking loss, shear force, colour) investigated. For the proximate chemical analysis of the M. longissimus dorsi et lumborum muscle, the effect of gender was only significant for the protein content, where the females (24.51%) displayed a higher percentage of protein compared to the males (23.68%). Neither the amino acid nor the mineral content differed significantly between the two genders. Glutamic acid (11.35 g/100 g) was the most abundant amino acid, followed by aspartic acid (2.94 g/100 g), glycine (0.86 g/100 g) and serine (0.66 g/100 g). The mineral content of mountain reedbuck indicated that meat derived from this species is high in phosphorus (206.47 mg/100 g), high in iron (4.19 mg/100 g), a source of zinc (1.80 mg/100 g), and low in sodium (4.19 mg/100 g). No significant differences between the genders for total saturated fatty acids (38.09%), total mono-unsaturated fatty acids (18.04%) or total polyunsaturated fatty acids (43.74%) were noted. The mean polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio for mountain reedbuck was 1.15 and the mean n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio 2.08.

Although the genetic diversity of this population is low, it is genetically distinct from the other two populations, the Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve and Mountain Zebra National Park populations, and thus vital for the conservation of this subspecies. The management of the Cape mountain zebra metapopulation requires the mixing of at least some animals from the three relict populations, but this process has been hampered by the relatively slow growth of the KNR population. We investigated the influence of habitat, fire and rainfall on mountain zebra population growth in KNR and used a diffusion model to perform a population viability analysis on the population.Mountain Fynbos covers more than 80% of the reserve but of this, only the Arid Restioid Fynbos and Waboomveld habitats were preferred by mountain zebra. The suitability of these habitats for mountain zebra is, however, highly variable and dependent on fire. The analysis also indicated that the population growth of mountain zebra is related to the incidence of fire and rainfall, but that the stochastic nature of these factors in space and time, limits the growth of the population. Although the population has a low probability of reaching quasi-extinction in the next 50 years (G = 0.123 x 10-4), we argue that the growth of this population will continue to be slow under the present 'hands off' management policy. A number of options to facilitate the growth of this population are considered; changing fire management in the habitat preferred by mountain zebra; acquiring adjacent land; and the translocation of mountain zebra onto adjacent land. Of these options, the latter two need to be implemented as part of a strategy to promote the management of the Cape mountain zebra metapopulation.",

An appreciation for the economic and ecological roles of large carnivores cannot be expected to improve if the correct information is lacking and misconceptions persist. Conservancies are growing in importance in the conservation of Namibia's wildlife outside protected areas and may be important structures for information dissemination and improving wildlife management. This study investigated the role that farming enterprise (livestock and mixed livestock / game farming) and conservancy membership played in human-large carnivore conflict on commercial farms in Namibia. Our study found that the attitude towards large carnivores was similar between farming enterprises but that conservancy members within each enterprise were more likely to be tolerant of large carnivores and to use livestock management options to reduce conflict, than non-conservancy members. Cause for concern however, was the high proportion of all farmers, including those belonging to conservancies, which reported removing large carnivores from their farms. This aspect is reflected in the poor content of conservancy management plans with regard to large carnivore management and human-large carnivore conflict mitigation measures. The failure to incorporate guidelines pertaining to human-carnivore conflict management into conservancy management plans reflects the lack of a structured approach to solving this conflict on farmlands.",

The cause of haemolysis is due to membrane damage through stimulation of IgM cold agglutinins production, which induces autoimmune haemolysis of infected erythrocytes. A study was conducted to establish the prevalence of Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' and 'Candidatus M. turicensis' in ticks and the diversity of tick species that are possible vectors of the pathogens that can transmit the infection to wildlife in Ngorongoro Crater. Three real-time PCR assays were used for the analysis of DNA pools (n= 507) derived from 11 tick species. Mycoplasma haemofelis and 'Candidatus M. haemominutum' were detected in Rhipicephalus sanguineus. On average 19.7% and 12.9% of R. sanguineus were PCR-positive for M. haemofelis and 'Candidatus M. haemominutum' respectively. This tick species therefore represent an important reservoir for feline haemotropic Mycoplasma species in the crater. These organisms with their known pathological effects are probably one of the factors potentially exacerbating the severity of infection during the disease outbreak in wildlife and can have undesirable outcome to wild cats like lions when under nutritional stress or in case of concurrent infection.",

We recorded forage selection by sable antelope within the context of the landscape units favoured in different seasons. Chrysopogon serrulatus, Panicum maximum, Heteropogon contortus, and Themeda triandra contributed most to the diet of sable antelope. Faecal crude protein content did not drop below 6.6% of dry matter during the dry season, with use of burnt grassland by sable contributing to an elevation in faecal protein levels at the beginning of the wet season. The sable population had increased to 127 animals by 1991, suggesting that the earlier lack of population growth had been due to below-average rainfall, lack of burns providing green regrowth during the dry season, or a delay in learning to exploit available forage resources efficiently.",

Although the mechanisms underlying these behavioural patterns are still incompletely understood, decreased predation risk or increased foraging competition in larger groups have been put forward as two possible explanations. Since most empirical tests of these two hypotheses have used manipulative experiments, they have mainly been limited to small-bodied species or to animals in captivity. Here we suggest a time-budget model to test for the causal effects of predation risk and foraging competition that does not necessitate manipulative approaches. We used this method on two species of gregarious antelope, blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) and impala (Aepyceros melampus). We suggest that increased foraging competition in large groups drives the negative relationship between vigilance and group size in these species. This study shows that observational data can be used to test explicit hypotheses on species that are logistically unsuitable for manipulative experiments, and also render support for hypotheses suggesting that factors unrelated to predation risk are involved in shaping the differences in vigilance rates over different group sizes in gregarious species.",

    "abstract": "The Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensisis one of Namibia's most valuable fish stocks, and an important component to the diet of Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, off northern Namibia. The level of overlap in the utilization of this resource between seals and the purse-seine fishery was investigated using two overlap indices. For high overlap measures, seals and the purse-seine fishery utilized age-2 horse mackerel. For low overlap measures, seals mainly consumed age-0 fish whereas the fishery caught age-2 fish. Both indices were adjusted by the proportion of horse mackerel in the seal diet, with the assumption that the proportion consumed by the seals reflects the abundance of horse mackerel in the coastal waters of Cape Cross, Namibia. Both unadjusted and adjusted overlap indices showed that overlap between seals and the fishery in their utilization of juvenile horse mackerel was high only at times when horse mackerel abundance was high, and low when abundance was small. Confidence intervals and significance testing were included. Overall, there was little overlap between seals and the purse-seine fishery. This study provides important information that should be taken into account in the management of the horse mackerel resource.",

Prevalence was determined using a PCR protocol designed to target a 577 bp fragment in the pol-RT gene. Overall prevalence of FIVPpa was estimated at 73%, with no difference in prevalence between male and female leopards. Consistent with previous FIV studies on other felid species, prevalence appears to increase with age (adult = 84%; subadult = 43%). Phylogenetic analyses of these novel sequences were conducted against a revised FIV pol-RT species-specific reference dataset using both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Within FIVPpa two distinct evolutionary groupings are present, which suggests the possibility of geographic variation within FIVPpa and the possibility of distinct subtypes, similar to what has been found in lions (Panthera leo) and domestic cats (Felis catus). The larger FIVPpa dataset provides newinsights into the epidemiology of this under-studied FIV strain and with such high prevalence rates, further studies should focus on immunological and clinical consequences of FIV in wild felids.",

(three males and four females) were measured during a structured release programme in Matusadona National Park, Zimbabwe. These measurements were then used to test for a relationship between spoor width and length, with the age and weight of the subadult rhinoceroses. In many areas where rhinoceroses occur it is not always possible to obtain visual records, and the ability to accurately assess the age of subadults from spoor will greatly assist management with determining recruitment rates into rhinoceros populations. The efficacy of the immobilization of rhinoceroses in the field would be greatly improved if the weights of subadults were known prior to darting. The results of this study found significant relationships between the spoor measurements and both age and weight, with spoor length being the best predictor variable. There is a need to determine the effect of soil substrate on these relationships. Although the spoor measurements were taken from the same area of ground, suggesting a similar soil substrate throughout, the measurements were taken from both dry and wet soil, depending on the season. It was also found that as the subadults reached maturity, variability in their spoor measurements increased. The results suggest that measuring spoor of subadults in the field could be a valuable management tool for determining recruitment and assessing drug dosages.",

From August 2002, 15 adult Nile crocodiles were captured over a 19-month period in the Flag Boshielo Dam. Conventional VHF transmitters were fitted to the tails of eight male and five female Nile crocodiles, while a GPS / GSM transmitter was fitted dorsally to the neck of one male and one female Nile crocodile. There was no significant difference in the total lengths of male and female Nile crocodiles captured for transmitter fitment. Overall, 40% of the transmitters failed, while an equal number was broken off. Neither sex, nor total length of the Nile crocodiles predicted longevity of transmitters from time of fitment to time of failure or destruction and loss. In future, the tails of crocodiles should be avoided when attaching transmitters, as conspecifics seem to target this area during agonistic behaviour. Moreover, it is essential that transmitters and their attachment configurations be tested on the target species before a study commences. Lastly, we urge researchers to routinely provide information on the performance of transmitters and their fitment configurations.",

    "abstract": "In southern Africa, local communities are integral to the success of conservation, especially outside of protected areas. Trophy hunting tourism has been considered a strategy which can generate economic benefits and influence conservation at local scales in sub-Saharan African countries, like Botswana. In 2019, Botswana lifted a five-year hunting ban and reintroduced trophy hunting tourism, catalysing a range of responses at local and international scales. To gain a more in-depth understanding of how changes in trophy hunting policy have shaped local adaptive capacity, we conducted 54 semi-structured interviews with three communities where trophy hunting tourism occurred: Mababe, Sankuyo, and Chobe Enclave. Communities had diverse responses to the lifting of the ban, illuminating the dynamic relationship between communities, conservation, and trophy hunting tourism and the overall resilience of the trophy hunting system. The findings suggest that the lifting of the hunting ban can serve as a catalyst for transformation and increased resilience, if there is strong communication across levels of government which cultivates inclusive decision-making and economic diversification to reduce dependency on trophy hunting tourism. Based on the study's findings, we present potential paths for the future of trophy hunting, which can inform policy and decision-making to support the adaptive capacity and resiliency of northern Botswana's communities and other regions where trophy hunting tourism occurs.",

As interactions occur at different scales, we explored the data at 1, 5, 10, and 15 km2. We proposed four hypotheses structuring the mammal community: H1, predator exclusion of herbivores by carnivores (apparent direct competition); H2–H4: indirect competition produced by each of three types of herbivore diet specialization: H2, ruminants and non-ruminants; H3, grazers and browsers, and H4, a four-way division of small and large grazers and browsers. We used the software CoOccur to implement a robust test for evidence of our hypotheses against null models of community assemblage. At 5, 10, and 15 km2 scales, the results supported a competition/exclusion mechanism in the majority of years for hypotheses H1, H3, and H4, and facilitation in H2. At the finest spatial scale (1 km2), we saw patterns resembling a mixture of competitive, neutral and facilitative process. These results suggest strong, large-scale effects of interspecific interactions on distributions of African megafauna, which may not operate at a more local (1 km2) scale, underscoring the importance of scale and mechanism in the guild structure of communities.",

We found that the wild boar has great potential to extend its invasive distribution range in South Africa. The most suitable habitats were in provinces with coastal boundaries, namely the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. Additionally, through an online questionnaire, we found out that of the participants, only 26.9% knew of the prevalence of wild boar, 29.5% about human–wild boar conflict, and 29.6% knew of hunting sites for the species; however, the majority (62.9%) knew of the species on the National Alien and Invasive Species List. Moreover, we also recorded localities of prevalence and hunting sites within KwaZulu-Natal province.

    "abstract": "Droughts have become more prevalent in recent years, causing problems for large herbivores such as the black (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhinoceros, whose populations are influenced by variation in climatic conditions. This variation acts primarily through the effects of rainfall on forage availability but acts differently on browse or grass. Consequently, browsing black rhinos and grazing white rhinos might show differing responses to changes in rainfall. Moreover, young large herbivores have a more limited capacity to survive environmental stressors than do adult animals that are more resilient to environmental variation. Thus, our aim was to investigate the relationship between rainfall and the survival of young (<3 years old) black and white rhinos at Lapalala Wilderness Nature Reserve, South Africa. Using stratified Cox models, we found that both species had higher survival with more rain, but the effect was more similar than expected given the differences in diets. Moreover, there was evidence of an effect of age class for white rhinos but not for black rhinos. Additionally, most rhinos that died did so during the dry season when scarce forage and limited fat reserves likely constrained their ability to tolerate periodically low-quality diets. Despite the effect of rainfall operating through substantially different plant growth forms, young animals of both rhino species showed sensitivity to variation in rainfall that could ultimately affect population abundance and conservation status.",

    "abstract": "Preston, Fuggle & Siegfried (1991) suggested measures by which authorities can make nature reserve visitors more circumspect in their consumption of resources, arguing that the measures have both practical conservation and interpretive value. A survey of 800 adult (over 18 year old) visitors to four South African nature reserve camps was undertaken to establish reaction to these proposed measures. The camps were selected to represent a broad spectrum of visitor profiles, and a 94% response rate was achieved. Widespread support for a user-pays approach to resource utilization was found. However, specific measures to adopt the user-paysapproach to control the use of electricity and water by visitors met with greater ambivalence. Nevertheless, there would appear to be sufficient support for most of the user-pays measures to warrant their implementation on a trial basis. There would also appear to be sufficient support for reserve authorities to test the effect of incorporating social costs as private costs, where practicable.\nPreston, Fuggle & Siegfried (1991) het maatreels voorgestel waarvolgens owerhede besoekers aan natuurreservate meer omsigtig kan maak m.b.t. hulle verbruik van hulpbronne, en redeneer dat die maatreels beide praktiese bewarings- en verklarende waarde het. 'n Meningsopname onder 800 volwasse (g 18 jaar oud) besoekers aan vier Suid-Afrikaanse natuurreservaatkampe is onderneem om die reaksie op die voorgestelde maatreels vas te stel. Die kampe is gekies om 'n wye spektrum van besoekersprofiele te verteenwoordig en 'n reaksiekoers van 94% is bereik. Wye ondersteuning is vir 'n 'verbuiker-betaal'-benadering tot hulpbronverbruik gevind. Spesifieke maatreels m.b.t. die aanneming van die 'verbruiker-betaal'-benadering om die elektrisiteits- en waterverbruik van besoekers te kontroleer, is egter met groter teenstrydigheid ontvang. Dit wil nietemin voorkom dat daar voldoende steun vir die meeste van die 'verbruiker-betaal'-maatstawwe is om die implementering daarvan op 'n proefbasis te regverdig. Dit wil ook voorkom asof daar voldoende steun is vir reservaatowerhede om, in gevalle waar dit uitvoerbaar is, die invloed van die insluiting van sosiale kostes as privaatkostes te toets.",

Certain indices were calculated for each month at each waterbody and the maximum values were as follows : number of species - 47; diversity (Shannon index) - 2,8; density - 35,1 birds / ha; biomass - 29 kg / ha. The six waterbodies were ranked, from highest to lowest, according to the mean values for five indices : two specific waterbodies were usually first or second, and a further two were usually fifth or sixth. The rankings reflected the major habitat differences between the waterbodies. Marked temporal variation in certain indices was attributed to two major environmental events, namely, a temporary dieback of submerged aquatic macrophytes and a series of major floods. Overall, there was a negative relationship between the indices and water level.\nWatervoels is tussen 1980 en 1984 op 'n maandelikse basis by die ses waterliggame van die Wilderness-Sedgefield Merekompleks, suidelike Kaapprovinsie, getel.

Water nickel concentrations were relatively constant, while large fluctuations were detected in the sediment nickel concentrations. The highest water and sediment nickel concentrations were measured at the Natalspruit River. The highest mean tissue concentration of nickel in P. warreni sampled from the three aquatic systems was detected in the carapace, indicating that this tissue might be used as a sink for nickel, for disposing of excessive amounts during the moult-cycle. No seasonal variation was detected. Sex also does not seem to be a variation factor in the bioaccumulation of nickel except in the mature gonads. P. warreni collected from the three different sampling sites showed a general increase in tissue nickel concentrations with a decrease in size. Significant correlations were observed between the midgut gland nickel concentrations and the concentration of this metal in the water (r = 0,63) and sediment (r = 0,77), as well as between the muscle nickel concentration and the water and sediment nickel concentrations (r = 0,63 and r = 0,77, respectively). These phenomena, as well as the fact that P. warreni is able to accumulate relatively high levels of nickel in various tissues, suggest that this freshwater crab is a potential indicator of nickel pollution in aquatic ecosystems.",

This paper focused on the large mammal resources of the proposed Kuku Community \nConservation Area (KCCA) and compared them to surrounding existing protected \nareas. This includes a preliminary survey of large mammal density and distribution on the \ngroup ranch; identification of a potential location of the sanctuary based on preliminary findings; \nand estimates of large mammal density and diversity in comparison with protected \nsites. Point counts, road transects and foot transects were used to count the large mammal \nspecies.

Further, the proposed sites had consistently \nhigher large mammal species diversity than Amboseli Park. There were large mammals \nof interest to tourists, including members of tourism's 'big five', making the selected \nlocation suitable for establishment of a wildlife sanctuary. The proximity to these famous \nparks, the presence of attractive physical features (such as Mt Kilimanjaro and Chyulu Hills) \nand Maasai culture makes the proposed KCCA viable for ecotourism. The model of the \nproposed KCCA should incorporate local access to resources (such as water, pasture and \nplant resources) during times of scarcity and therefore make it a multiple-use conservation \narea with critical resources for pastoralism as well as supporting ecotourism.",

Northern KZN recorded a higher frequency of this trend (57.7%, n = 26) compared to the Midlands (35.7%, n = 14), as did Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Reserves (85.7%, n = 7) compared to privately owned properties (42.4%, n = 33). Very little species-specific management for nyala and bushbuck occurred on properties that participated in the present survey. Only 67% of properties ( n = 40) had population estimates for these species and most properties indicated that these estimates were vague. Nyala were primarily controlled by hunting (34.7%, n = 40), particularly in the Midlands, (63. 2%, n = 14), and live sales (34.7%, n = 40), particularly in northern KZN (40%, lIgnl/Ig = 26). In the Midlands 50% of properties regulated bushbuck numbers by hunting, 12.5% by live capture, and 37.5% indicated that they did not need to take animals off as no population excess occurred. This is in contrast to only 3.8% of properties in northern KZN which regulated bushbuck abundance by hunting, 11.5% by live capture, and 65.5% which did not need to regulate bushbuck abundance because numbers of this species were too low.",

The body fluids of prey, metabolic water and surface water formed the sources of water for these leopards, but there was no significant difference between the frequency of water-use by adult males, females without cubs, and females with cubs. Male leopards in the southern Kalahari either drank water or had access to moisture in the form of kills at known intervals of 2.7 days or 39.7 km, compared with 2.2 days and 29.4 km for females without cubs, and 1.6 days and 23.6 km for females with cubs. Succulent, wild fruits were utilized, but only infrequently so. The leopards drank borehole water that could be potentially hazardous to their health and decrease their productivity. This can have serious wildlife management implications.",

We investigated the physical and thermal characteristics of aardwolf dens. Aardwolf dens usually had only one entrance with a single, long tunnel. It appears as if aardwolves did not dig their own burrows but enlarged the burrows of springhares. Mean temperature of the burrows was 27.2 lUg+l/Ug 02Â°C during summer and 12.2 lUg+l/Ug 1.2Â°C during winter. Daily fluctuations in den temperature were reduced compared to surface ambient temperature. This favourable, thermally-stable environment is used by aardwolves to escape the external thermal extremes, as a refuge for the rearing of young, and to evade predation from black-backed jackals and other mammalian carnivores.",

Prior to this study, it was only known from a single locality in the Hottentots Holland Mountains. The extent of occurrence \nof P. nebulosusl/Ig was determined, resource partitioning among the three melanistic cordylids \n( C. oelofseni, P. capensisl/Ig and P. nebulosus ), co-occurring in this area, investigated, and the conservation status of P. nebulosusl/Ig re-evaluated. The extent of occurrence of P. nebulosusl/Ig was estimated to be only 11 km 2 . Of the three melanistic cordylids, lIgP.nebulosushasl/Ig by far the smallest range, completely overlapping the ranges of both the other two melanistic cordylids. Pseudocordylus nebulosusl/Ig was found to show a distinct affinity for surface water such as mountain streams and seepage areas. Distinct differences in resource partitioning were found among the three species regarding crevice selection, which should prevent any \nsignificant competition during periods of environmental stress. Although inappropriate fire management and global warming may be immediate threats to the survival of this species, \nthe threats posed by the popular hiking trail in the area are probably less significant than were previously thought.

Some \nmembers of the pack were radio-collared and the dogs were followed daily by researchers \nfrom April 2002 to January 2003. Prey selection and the use of barriers during the wild dogs' \nhunts were studied. Barriers were defined as objects such as game fences, flowing rivers \nand dams, which impeded a fleeing prey animal's escape. Kudu ( Tragelaphus strepsiceros ) \ncomprised the majority (60%) of the dogs' kills, although they made up only 14% of the total \nprey items available to the dogs.Wild dogs in the reserve made 81% of their kills within 20m \nof a barrier, although these 20 m zones made up only 1.7% of the total area available to the \ndogs in the reserve. Being able to factor the use of barriers into their hunts could explain the \npreponderance of large prey in their diet. Because wild dogs make most of their kills near or \nat barriers, there are important management implications of having wild dogs in small \nreserves. These include ensuring that fences are sturdy and monitored for damage which \nmight occur during hunts. The ability of wild dogs to successfully target the larger prey \nanimals may also have an effect on the carnivore/prey balance and should be monitored \ncarefully.",

    "abstract": "At present, a single viable population of endangered African wild dogs occurs in South \nAfrica, in the Kruger National Park. Current conservation efforts focus on reintroducing \nwild dogs into a series of fenced reserves, thereby creating a meta-population in which \nsub-populations are actively managed to conserve genetic diversity. Additional options \nexist for conserving wild dogs outside protected areas. We report on an attempt to assess \nthe numbers of wild dogs remaining outside protected areas as a precursor for conservation \nplanning and show that they form a more significant component of the national population \nthan previously recognized. Total numbers outside protected areas in South Africa are \nestimated to have fluctuated between 42 and 106 animals during the period 1996-2002. Of \nthese, 25-67 individuals were thought to be resident outside protected areas during this \nperiod, with an extent of occurrence of 43 310 kmlsupg2l/supg and an area of occupancy of 17 907 km 2 . \nSightings were most frequently reported from the western border of Kruger National Park, \nthe Limpopo Valley, and northern KwaZulu-Natal. Most wild dogs occur on game ranches \nwith unmodified land cover and low human densities, close to source populations. Significant \nscope for distribution expansion exists in the Limpopo and North West Provinces. \nHowever, efforts aimed at changing landowner attitudes towards wild dogs are necessary to \nimprove the conservation status of the species outside protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Both interference and exploitative competition for prey occurs between carnivore species, which can be exacerbated if the carnivore species are of similar body size, meaning that they select for similar prey species. Studies on competition within the large carnivore guild in Africa have mainly focused on the interactions between the larger dominant (lions, Panthera leo, and spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta) and smaller, submissive (cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, and African wild dogs, Lycoan pictus) species. However, given that cheetahs and African wild dogs are similar-sized and diurnal, they have a high overlap in dietary preference and hence scope for competition. Here, we investigate whether competition with African wild dogs shapes cheetah prey preference by comparing cheetah prey selection before and after reintroductions of African wild dogs. We show that cheetahs experienced high dietary overlap with African wild dogs but become more generalized hunters in the presence of African wild dogs. Moreover, cheetahs used three key prey species (impala, Aepyceros melampus, nyala, Tragelaphus angasii, and common duiker, Sylvicapra grimmia) differently following African wild dog reintroductions. We suggest that this reflects predominantly exploitative competition between these predators, particularly for impala. Such diet shifts may be useful indicators of resource limitations for managers conserving these two threatened small predators.",

We studied such a population at Kgaswane Mountain Reserve (KMR), South Africa, using radio-collared animals to better understand eland range use in a landscape with restricted movement. Placement of home ranges within the reserve changed from favouring woodland to dry grassland after the beginning of the wet season, while wet grassland was favoured all year. Habitat use within home ranges indicated an interaction between vegetation types and elevation that changed with season: low-elevation selection for dry grassland, open shrubland and woodland changed to selection for wet and dry grassland; high-elevation selection for open shrubland alone changed to selection for both open shrubland and woodland. Despite the fenced nature of KMR, eland appeared to have sufficiently flexible behaviour to follow landscape use and seasonal home range changes demonstrated by eland in less restrictive environments. Management activities that promote fine-scale heterogeneity and varying levels of woody cover might compensate for lack of mobility where fences limit broad-scale movements.",

Their precipitous, synchronous decline was \nattributed mainly to poaching and a succession of long, dry winters. Population recovery \nafter 1993 was probably constrained by a reduction in habitat on adjoining properties and, \nfor reedbuck and oribi, by increased competition from increasing populations of blesbok \n( Damaliscus dorcas phillipsii ) and wildebeest ( Connochaetes gnou ).

    "abstract": "Concern over declining yields in stocks of the living exploitable resources of the sea in various parts of the world has stimulated wide interest in aquaculture. Marine animals which have been cultivated artificially can be divided into three categories: carnivores, herbivores and filter feeders. The basic methods employed in the cultivation of animals in these three categories are reviewed. Progress made in several countries in aquaculture techniques is illustrated but mention is also made of various problems which have been encountered. On this basis the potential of marine aquaculture in South Africa is considered, taking the geomorphology of our coastline, climatic conditions, the types of animals available as well as marketing outlets, into account. The conclusion is reached that research in this direction is well worthwhile but that it is unlikely that aquaculture will replace the need for sound management of natural resources in the near future.",

Results of the study, only summarised in this paper, indicated both francolins to be animals of fire-climax grasslands. Factors limiting stocks of these birds appeared to concern density of cover, quality' and quantity of food, and possibly social behaviour. Recommendations made for habitat management for the two francolins concern management of plant succession by use of fire, control of interspersion of burnt and unburnt areas of grassland, and compensating on farmland for reduction in natural control of interspersion of burnt and unburnt areas of grassland, and compensating on farmland for reduction in natural redwing habitat, as a result of farming practices, through provision of extra food and cover on small, strategically situated areas.",

During a four-year study at eight different sites, baboons were captured using cage traps. This study suggested that cage traps were effective in capturing baboons. Cage traps covered with a wire mesh (size = 25 mm) and equipped with trap door locking mechanisms, were more effective than traps not complying with these requirements. Furthermore, the success of cage traps in capturing baboons was influenced positively by conditioning troop members to feed at trap sites during the baiting phase, by using firm bait during trapping, and by trapping under fine weather conditions.\nDie effektiwiteit van vanghokke en faktore wat die vangresultate van bobbejane Papio ursinus beinvloed, is ondersoek in die Wes-Kaapprovinsie. Gedurende 'n vierjaarstudie op agt verskillende lokaliteite, is bobbejane met vanghokke gevang. Hierdie studie het aangedui dat vanghokke effektiewe bobbejaanvangapparate is. Vanghokke met 'n maasdraadbedekking (grootte = 25 mm) en toegerus met valdeursluitmeganismes, was meer effektief as hokke wat nie aan hierdie vereistes voldoen het nie. Verder, word die sukses van bobbejaanvanghokke positief beinvloed deur troplede gedurende die aanlokfase te kondisioneer om by vangplekke te vreet, deur ferm lokaas gedurende die vangfase te gebruik, en deur in mooiweerstoestande te vang.",

Kidney fat and bone marrow indices were significantly lower and adrenal indices higher in the experimental group after four weeks of confinement compared with values obtained in control impala. Body mass and plasma total lipid concentration decreased while plasma urea nitrogen concentration increased over the confinement period in the experimental group. These physiological changes indicate that mobilization of fat reserves accompanied by a change in nutritional status occurred in these animals probably as a result of reduced food intake and physiological stress associated with boma-confinement and repeated capture in nets.\nLiggaamsmassa, plasma totale lipide-konsentrasie, plasma-ureumstikstof en niervet-, beenmurg- en adrenale indekse vir rooibokke (Aepyceros melampus melampus) onderworpe aan boma-aanhouding en herhaalde vangs in nette (eksperimentele groep), sowel as vir vrylewende rooibakke (kontrolegroep) is bepaal.

The parasite was unable to infect turkeys and domestic fowls. In addition to ring and spherical forms typical of Aegyptianella pullorum, the organism also exhibited numerous irregularly shaped forms. Because of its inability to infect domestic fowls and morphological differences the organism is considered to be a species distinct from A. pullorum. Argasid larvae found on the wild guineafowls were not Argas walkerae.\nDrie isolate van 'n Aegyptianella sp. is in jong tarentale wat eksperimenteel met die bloed van wilde tarentale vanaf die Skukuza-gebied van die Nasionale Kruger-Wildtuin ingespuit is, gevestig. Dit was nie moontlik om kalkoene of hoenders met die parasiet te besmet nie. Bykomstig tot die ring- en sfeerfatsoene wat tipies is van Aegyptianella pullorum, het die organisme ook as veelvuldige onreelmatige vorms voorgekom. Omdat die organisme nie hoenders kon besmet nie en weens morfologiese verskille, blyk dit 'n spesie anders as A. pullorum te wees. Tampanlarwes op die wilde tarentale was nie die van Argas walkerae nie.",

Daily fluctuations in energy intake were observed, with a period of high intake being followed by a period of lower intake. Individual fish consumed 0 - 45% of body weight per day, which was within the range recorded for other species. Daily food intake (dry weight or energy) was affected by fish weight and could be described by the model: Food intake = a (live body weight)b. Energy intake of the fish was the highest when they were fed twice a day or when food was continuously available. Energy intake of individual fish was higher when eitherDonax serra or Liza richardsonii was fed than when Macropetasma africanus was fed. Energy intake of all the species (except that of R. annulatus) was significantly influenced by temperature and was generally higher at 20°C than at 15°C. The relevance of these findings is discussed.\nDie voedselinname van Lithognathus lithognathus, Lithognathus mormyrus, Pomadasys commersonnii, Lichia amia, Myliobatus aquila en Rhinobatos annulatus is onder beheerde laboratoriumtoestande bepaal. Daaglikse fluksiasies in energie-inname is waargeneem. 'n Periode van hoe inname is deur 'n laer inname periode gevolg. Individuele visse het 0 - 45% van hul lewende gewig per dag geeet. Soortgelyke inname waardes is vir ander spesies waargeneem. Daaglikse voedselinname (droe massa of energie) is deur die massa van die visse beinvloed en is deur die vergelyking: Voedselinname = a (lewende liggaamsmassa)b beskryf. Gedurende die eksperimentele periode was die energie-inname van visse wat Donax serra of Liza richardsonii gevoer is, hoer as die van visse wat Macropetasma africanus gevoer is. Temperatuur het die energie-inname van al die spesies beduidend beinvloed (behalwe die van Rhinobatus annulatus) en was hoer by 20°C as by 15°C. Die toepaslikheid van die bevindinge word bespreek.",

This paper describes linear programming and how this objective can be achieved using this approach.\nDie meeste wildplase het verskeie wildspesies waarvan die getalle op 'n natuurlike manier beheer word. Daar is dus kompetisie tussen spesies en die wat die laagste profyt toon is gewoonlik die oorheersende spesie.
