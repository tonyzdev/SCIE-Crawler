    "abstract": "Dementia in China is increasingly burdensome yet remains underrecognized and undertreated due to low awareness and persistent stigma. Community-based strategies are urgently needed to address these barriers. By using real-world data from an 18-month dementia campaign in Wuhan, we retrospectively evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of opinion leader intervention (OLI), a novel, community-driven approach, in improving dementia knowledge, reducing stigma, and promoting screening among older urban adults. Starting in August 2023, a three-phase campaign was launched, targeting 3550 residents aged ≥60 years in the Jiangdijie community, Wuhan. The pre-intervention phase (6 months) included monthly expert-led dementia education lectures at a senior center (30-60 attendees/session). The traditional intervention phase (next 6 months) involved distributing brochures in public areas and doubling lecture frequency. The final OLI phase (6 months) engaged 19 trained opinion leaders to disseminate knowledge, encourage screening, and model preventive behaviors during daily interactions. Free dementia screening was available throughout the campaign. Outcomes-dementia knowledge scores, stigma-related attitude scores, and screening participation rates-were assessed via samples randomly drawn from the elderly residents at the end of each phase (T0: n = 100, T1: n = 117, T2: n = 100). Dementia knowledge scores among older adults increased from 12.27 (T0) to 13.51 (T1), with a significant jump to 17.63 post-OLI (T2 vs T1, p < 0.001). Stigmatizing attitudes scores improved from 2.11 (T0) to 2.43 (T1), rising further to 2.98 at T2 (T2 vs T1, p = 0.010). Participation rates in dementia screening rose from 18.0% (T0) to 23.9% (T1), surging to 46.0% post-OLI (T2 vs T1, p < 0.001). The OLI was associated with marked improvements in dementia knowledge, reduced stigma, and higher screening uptake compared with traditional health education methods. These findings highlight OLI's potential as a feasible strategy to enhance dementia awareness and care in Chinese urban communities.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors that sustain physical activity among college students is crucial for promoting a healthy lifestyle, as emphasized by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3. While the link between physical activity and health outcomes is established, less is known about how physical exercise self-efficacy (PESE) influences persistent exercise behavior (PEB) through different forms of physical activity engagement (PAE). This study investigates whether PESE promotes PEB via cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement, based on self-determination theory (SDT) and engagement theory. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 16 to August 16, 2023, involving 900 Chinese college students recruited through convenience sampling on the Questionnaire Star platform, the participants were selected through convenience sampling, which ensured the inclusion of a diverse demography across various grades, educational backgrounds, and study fields. Before the participants provided informed consent, they were briefed on the study's objectives, data processing procedures, and privacy protections. Validated scales assessed PESE, PAE, and PEB. Data quality was ensured by excluding invalid or incomplete responses. Statistical analyses were performed in several stages. Using SPSS, item and reliability analyses of the research instrument were performed to confirm internal consistency. Then, the confirmatory factor analysis was performed for each scale by using AMOS. Finally, structural equation modeling was used to validate the proposed research model and conduct path analysis, thereby assessing the hypothesized relationships among PESE, PAE, and PEB. PESE positively influenced cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement in physical activity. These forms of engagement, in turn, positively affected fluency experience (FE), which subsequently enhanced PEB. The findings indicate that PESE augments FE by improving PAE, leading to sustained exercise behavior among college students. The study demonstrates the critical role of PESE in fostering persistent exercise behavior through its impact on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement. These insights highlight the importance of designing interventions that enhance PESE and PAE to promote long-term commitment to physical activity among college students, supporting broader health and well-being goals.",

However, limited research has explored this comorbidity from the perspective of individuals with depression and anxiety exhibiting obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). This study aims to investigate the prevalence and potential associations between depression, anxiety, and OCS in the adolescent patient population. A retrospective study was employed in this research. A total of: 327 drug-naive, first-episode adolescent patients aged 10 to 19 years, presenting both depressive and anxiety symptoms, were recruited from the Shanghai Pudong New Area Mental Health Center in China. The Chinese version of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was used to assess the severity of OCS. Binary logistic regression was applied to analyze the influence of depression and anxiety levels on OCS. More than half (52.3%) of the 327 adolescent participants with depressive and anxiety symptoms had severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). Additionally, 35.9% had moderate OCS, 12.9% had mild OCS, and only 2.8% were symptom-free. The results also indicated a significant correlation between OCS and both depression (β = 0.073, Wald χ2 < 0.001, p < 0.005) and anxiety levels (β = 0.066, Wald χ2 < 0.005, p < 0.001). The findings provide valuable insights into the predictive ability of depression and anxiety level in the development of OCS and OCD during adolescence, highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention. Future studies should include a larger and more diverse sample, with the incorporation of professional clinical evaluations to further verify these results.

Pregnant female rats were administered either sterile saline or VPA on embryonic day 12.5. The brains of the rat offspring were collected on postnatal day 30 for analysis. Immunohistochemical techniques and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to assess changes in microglia-neuron crosstalk. The study revealed a significant reduction in CD200 levels within the hippocampus of rats on postnatal day 30 following prenatal exposure to VPA, indicating an impairment in CD200/CD200R signaling. Additionally, there was no observed increase in microglial numbers or any pathological alterations in the hippocampus. Additionally, no significant changes in the levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 were noted in the VPA-exposed rats compared with the control group. Prenatal exposure to VPA resulted in a decrease in CD200 expression within the hippocampus, potentially disrupting the communication between microglia and neurons. The findings suggest that VPA may modify the interactions between microglia and neurons, which could lead to neuroinflammation due to hyperactivated microglia. These disruptions have the potential to affect synaptic connectivity and contribute to the development of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Further research is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms and implications for pathological conditions associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disease in which impaired social behaviors, impaired sociality, and restricted and repetitive behaviors are seen. Bumetanide is a loop diuretic that inhibits Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 and it is currently used in clinical phase studies in patients with autism spectrum disorder. In present research, it is purposed to demonstrate the beneficial effects of torasemide which is another Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 inhibitor on an experimental autism model induced with propionic acid by providing imaging and brain tissue investigations. Male Wistar rats were used in the present study (n = 30). Propionic acid of 250 mg/kg/day was administrated intraperitoneally in rats to induce autism for 5 days. Three groups were created for present study as follows: group 1, normal control (n = 10); group 2, propionic acid and saline given group (n = 10); group 3, propionic acid + tora-semide-administrated group (n = 10). Torasemide group scored higher on behavioral tests compared to saline group. The brain levels of malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-17, and Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were remarkably higher in propionic acid + saline group. In histopathology assessments, torasemide group had higher neuronal count of Cornu Ammonis 1, neuronal count of Cornu Ammonis 2 in hippocampus, and Purkinje cells in cerebellum. GFAP immunostaining index (Cornu Ammonis 1) and cerebellum were lower in torasemide group. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that mean lactate value was higher in propionic acid + saline group compared to torasemide group. Our experimental results showed that torasemide might enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid activity. Torasemide can be considered another promising Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 inhibitor in the treatment of autism with a longer half-life and less side effects after further studies.",

    "abstract": "Quality of life is extensively studied in older persons, but there are few studies that investigate it in people with subjective cognitive decline. Our aim was to evaluate the quality of life in a Romanian sample of individuals with subjective cognitive decline compared to controls while accounting for different possible moderators. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the quality of life in a Romanian subjective cognitive decline sample. We conducted an observational study to evaluate differences in the quality of life between subjective cognitive decline and controls. Participants were evaluated for subjective cognitive decline according to Jessen et al. We collected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and information about physical activity. Quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form-36 questionnaire. There were 101 participants included in the analysis with 66.33% (n = 67) in the subjective cognitive decline group. There were no differences between the social, demographic, and clinical characteristics of the individuals. The subjective cognitive decline group had a higher score on the negative emotion trait of Big Five. Individuals with subjective cognitive decline reported poorer physical functioning (P = .034), more role limitations due to physical health (P = .010) and emotional problems (P = .019), and less energy (P = .018) compared to the control group. Persons with subjective cognitive decline reported diminished quality of life compared to controls and differences were not explained by other sociodemographic and clinical characteristics evaluated. This area could prove to be an important target for nonpharmacological interventions in the subjective cognitive decline group.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine sex differences in the antidepressant and neurocognitive effects of adjunctive nonconvulsive electrotherapy (NET) in patients with treatment-refractory depression (TRD), which has not yet been thoroughly investigated. The study enrolled 20 patients with TRD, comprising 11 males and 9 females, who underwent a series of 6 NET sessions. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) was used to assess depressive symptoms, response, and remission at baseline and after the first, third, and sixth NET sessions. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was used to assess neurocognitive function at baseline and after the sixth NET session. After completing 6 NET sessions, female patients experiencing TRD exhibited a higher inclination toward achieving an antidepressant response (77.8% vs. 45.5%, P = .197) and antidepressant remission (22.2% vs. 0%, P = .189) when compared to their male counterparts. No significant differences were observed in changes in the HAMD-17 and WCST subscale scores (all P > .05), including completing classification number, total error number, persistent error number, and random error number between males and females. Additionally, no significant correlations were observed between baseline WCST subscale scores and changes in HAMD-17 scores or endpoint scores, irrespective of sex (all P > .05). These pilot findings suggest that female patients with TRD exhibited increased rates of achieving antidepressant response and remission after undergoing NET. However, further studies should be conducted to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) seriously affects the reproductive health of women. Several studies have been conducted to show that POI appears to be associated with psychological and psychosocial problems, but whether POI increases the risk of mental health problems has not been identified. Therefore, this meta-analysis provides a preliminary systematic assessment of the studies published to date on the impact of POI on women's mental health. We implemented a systematic search for studies on this topic up to October 2022. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) of prevalence were used to assess the impacts of POI on various psychological factors, and the publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. A total of 15 articles comprising 5820 participants were included in this meta-analysis. POI was found to be related to higher risk of 13 psychological and psychosocial problems identified and classified into 3 domains: depression (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.11-2.33), anxiety (OR = 3.74; 95% CI: 1.78-7.87), and poor life quality (OR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.63-3.97). This meta-analysis reveals that women with POI have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and poor life quality. The marital status of POI may be a possible influencing factor for depression, meaning that the unmarried status in POI is at high risk of psychological and psychosocial problems. We should pay attention to the mental health of women with POI who were unmarried.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of patients initially diagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder but whose symptoms were later attributed to medical conditions. These patients' initial and final diagnoses were also examined. The records of 1843 patients hospitalized in Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Psychiatric Inpatient Clinic between 2015 and 2020 were examined in this retrospective and descriptive study. Thirteen patients were excluded from the study due to insufficient data. Descriptive statistics were performed on the data of 30 patients diagnosed with an underlying medical condition. In follow-up, 49 patients' diagnoses changed. 19 patients had a diagnosis unrelated to an underlying medical condition, and 30 had a diagnosis related to an underlying medical condition. Five (16.7%) of the patients, previously known to have psychiatric disorders, were found to have Alzheimer's disease. Brain space-occupying lesions, frontotemporal dementia, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and Arnold-Chiari malformation followed Alzheimer's disease at 6.7% (n = 2). The mean time until the diagnosis of the patients was revised was 4.95 years (standard deviation [SD] = 7.78). It was observed that psychotropic medications (90%) were used more than non-psychotropic drugs until the diagnosis was revised. During the diagnostic process, we believe that clinicians should be aware of potential underlying medical conditions and that the multidisciplinary work of psychiatry and neurology is also crucial.",

Adverse childhood events (ACEs) have been shown to be associated with various mental illnesses; however, to date the impact of such events on NSSI in youth has not been reviewed. We conducted a systematic review, searched 5 databases for published articles evaluating ACE and NSSI in youth less than or equal to 21 years of age. After screening 247 articles, we included 21 unique articles in this systematic review. Increasing ACE score, physical, sexual or emotional abuse, parental neglect and substance use, parental separation or dysfunctional family, and death of a close family member had statistically significant correlation with NSSI. Non-suicidal self-injury is an impairing diagnosis with far reaching psychiatric manifestations and repercussions. Practitioners having high clinical suspicion for ACEs in youth with NSSI must intervene early by administering the ACEs questionnaire. Effective treatment of NSSI in those with ACEs with psychotherapy significantly improves outcomes and prevents suicide in youth.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on SCZ patients admitted between June 2020 and June 2021. Initially, 80 patients were treated with paliperidone, while 36 received a combination of paliperidone and sertraline. Propensity score matching based on 3 covariates resulted in 2 groups: the control group (paliperidone alone, n = 36) and the observation group (paliperidone + sertraline, n = 36). The clinical efficacy, adverse reactions, quality of life scores, serum biomarkers levels related to nerve and liver function, and anxiety and depression levels were compared between the 2 groups. The observation group demonstrated higher total effectiveness than the control group (p = 0.011). Post-treatment, the scores of all dimensions of quality of life in both groups were improved, and the observation group was higher than the control group (p < 0.001). Post-treatment, the observation group exhibited lower neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and higher neuregulin 1 (NRG1) levels than the control group (p < 0.001). The levels of aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBiL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased in both groups post-treatment (p < 0.001). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) decreased in both groups post-treatment, and the observation group had lower levels of these cytokines compared to the control group after treatment (p < 0.001). Post-treatment, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score decreased in both groups, with the observation group showing lower scores than the control group (p < 0.001). The changes in the scores of various dimensions of quality of life, HAMA and HAMD scores, neurofunctional factors and inflammatory markers levels in the observation group were greater than those in the control group (p < 0.001). There were no serious side effects during and after treatment in both groups. Paliperidone combined with sertraline effectively improves serum neuregulin levels in SCZ patients, alleviates negative emotional effects without causing liver or kidney damage, and demonstrates excellent clinical efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hospitalized at least three times in a two-year period, have emerged as an unintended side effect of the deinstitutionalization of mental health in high-income countries. Guaranteeing access to high-quality outpatient services has shown to be the most effective method for alleviating the revolving door phenomenon. In Eastern Europe, deinstitutionalization is ongoing, 0 but the phenomenon has received little attention. The present cross-sectional study examined the revolving door phenomenon in the largest psychiatric inpatient unit in Bucharest, Romania. Methods: Socio-demographic healthcare use and clinical characteristics of 144 patients were collected following admission to the “Profesor Doctor Alexandru Obregia” Psychiatric Hospital via an initial visit conducted between September 2022 and January 2023. A follow-up check occurred one year later to evaluate the number of readmissions and compare those who met the criteria for revolving door status at follow-up with those who did not. After identifying factors associated with revolving door status by univariate analysis, a bivariate model included the results to account for reciprocal moderating effects. Results: In total, 56 (38.9%) patients met the criteria for revolving door status. The number of lifetime hospitalizations was significantly higher in the revolving door group (odds ratio (OR) = 3.956, p ≤ 0.001), while involuntary admission on the initial visit decreased the odds of receiving a revolving door status on follow-up (OR = 0.188, p = 0.008). Revolving door patients had less time between readmissions than controls (OR = 0.991, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Frequent hospitalization was the primary factor predicting revolving door status in the cohort studied, reflecting the Romanian mental health system’s focus on inpatient care. This illustrates the need for reliable outpatient care as an alternative to hospital admission to avoid the self-perpetuating cycle of repeated admissions that are inefficient both from an economic and medical standpoint.",

We carried out a historical analysis of the discovery of new antidepressants, resorting to the original articles published on their development (initial pharmacological and clinical information) and applied an operational criterion of serendipity developed by our group. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, and escitalopram), selective dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (bupropion), noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, milnacipram, duloxetine, and desvenlafaxine), selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (reboxetine), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (mirtazapine), melatonergic agonists (agomelatine), and serotonin modulators and stimulators (vortioxetine, vilazodone, tianeptine) correspond to the type IV pattern. Moclobemide, a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, corresponds to the type II pattern, for which the initial serendipitous findings (i.e., the chance discovery of the inhibitory effects of monoamine oxidase (MAO) whilst being studied for their antihyperlipidemic properties) led to subsequent non-serendipitous discoveries (clinical antidepressant efficacy). Ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, corresponds to the type III pattern, characterized by a non-serendipitous origin (initial development as an anesthetic agent) leading to a serendipitous observation (the discovery of antidepressant efficacy in individuals illicitly using). The majority of new antidepressants adhere to a type IV pattern, characterized by a rational and targeted design process where serendipity played no part, except moclobemide (type II pattern) and ketamine (type III pattern).",

Methods: A total of 674 students from a university in southern China were recruited. Assessments of participants’ body measurements were conducted, followed by the completion of a general information questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Bedtime Procrastination Scale, Body Appreciation Scale, Body Image-Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Ruminative Responses Scale, and University of Loneliness Scale. Stepwise multiple linear regression and mediation models were employed to separately analyze the associations between sleep quality and the aforementioned factors in males and females. Results: Sex differences in sleep quality were apparent, with women having worse sleep quality than men (p &lt; 0.05). In men, bedtime procrastination (β = 0.376, p &lt; 0.01), loneliness (β = 0.339, p &lt; 0.01), and rumination (β = 0.171, p &lt; 0.01) were significant factors in predicting sleep quality. Loneliness played a partial mediating role in predicting poor sleep quality caused by bedtime procrastination, with a mediating effect of 18.95%.

Loneliness and body appreciation played parallel mediating roles in predicting sleep quality through bedtime procrastination, with mediating effects of 9.24% and 5.19%, respectively. Conclusions: Sleep quality and bedtime procrastination were worse in women than in men. The sleep quality of female students may be increased by focusing on enhancing positive body image, while for male students, managing rumination and reducing loneliness could be helpful.",

However, the understanding of which specific balance areas are affected remains incomplete at present. Methods: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus and EBSCO from the establishment of the database to March 17, 2024. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed through Review Manager software, and a narrative description of the results was used if the data could not be pooled for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 16 studies were included, with six being suitable for meta-analysis. The research indicated that individuals with ASD showed poorer balance control compared with TD peers. Specifically, the ASD group faced significant difficulties in sensory orientation and demonstrated deficiencies in verticality and anticipatory postural adjustments. Conclusions: Children and youth with ASD exhibit impairments in balance control across different domains compared with their TD peers. More research is needed to comprehensively assess the balance control construct in this population, including studies with longitudinal designs in particular.

Partial correlation analysis and regression analysis were then used to investigate the association between executive function, ADHD symptoms, and arithmetic ability. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis and path analysis were used to differentiate the effect of executive functions on ADHD without developmental dyscalculia (ADHD-DD) and ADHD+DD. Results: Both ADHD groups had more severe executive function impairment than the control group. Compared with the ADHD-DD group, the ADHD+DD group performed worse in performance-based executive functions but similar in scale-based executive functions. ADHD-DD and ADHD were differentiated by inhibition (odds ratio (OR) = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.42; 2.81) and processing speed (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.84; 0.97). In terms of symptom dimensions, verbal working memory had an effect on ADHD symptoms and complex subtraction (pIna = 0.006, pHI = 0.018, pCS = 0.002), processing speed (pIna = 0.002, pCS = 0.001) and working memory factors influenced inattention and complex subtraction (pIna &lt; 0.001, pCS = 0.001), and inhibition (p = 0.004) and cognitive flexibility (p = 0.013) contributed uniquely to complex subtraction. Conclusion: Individuals with ADHD+DD exhibit multiple executive function deficits, with inhibition and processing speed being potential etiological factors. Verbal working memory, processing speed, and working memory factors are shared executive function deficits for ADHD symptoms and arithmetic ability. Cognitive flexibility and inhibition are specific risk factors for arithmetic ability.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder marked by impaired interactions and restricted interests, the pathophysiology of which is not fully understood. The current study explored the potential therapeutic effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the neurophysiological aspects of ASD, specifically focusing on the brain's excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and behavioral outcomes, providing scientific guidance for ASD intervention. Forty-two children with ASD were randomly divided into either an active tDCS or sham tDCS group. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were conducted before and after stimulation to assess E/I changesusing EEG markers including α oscillations and the aperiodic exponent, and average spatial phase synchronization (ASPS) analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were performed. Behavioral changes were evaluated using the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Active tDCS resulted in significant increases in α oscillation power, reductions in α bandwidth, and improvements in γ-band ASPS and DFA values. Furthermore, participants in the active tDCS group exhibited improvements in behavioral scores on the ABC and SRS, with enhancements in social communication, sensory processing, and adaptive behavior. We found no significant changes in the sham group. These findings suggest that tDCS intervention effectively reduced brain excitability and improved E/I balance and behavioral outcomes in children with ASD. The results warrant further investigation into the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of tDCS for ASD treatment. No: ChiCTR2400092790, https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=249950.",

    "abstract": "Burnout is a prevalent psychological state among resident doctors. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence and associated factors of burnout among resident medical doctors in Medina, Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 426 resident doctors in Medina city, Saudi Arabia. We used the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) to measure this phenomenon. Of the participants, 81.22% scored high on at least one subscale of burnout and 18.31% scored high on all the subscales of burnout. Burnout was related to lack of physical exercise (P < .001), level of training (P < .001), number of on-call shifts per month (P = .020), number of weekends on-call per month (P < .050), number of patients seen per day (P = .002), number of clinics per week (P < .001), satisfaction with work-life balance (P < .001), and sources of stress in the workplace (P < .050). Burnout is present among resident doctors at a relatively high rate. Numerous factors associated with burnout were evident, particularly work-related factors and sources of stress in the workplace. Therefore, the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties and the residency program directors should act to improve working conditions and work-life balance, and minimize the impact of stressors in the workplace, to minimize the consequences of burnout among resident doctors. Provisions could be enacted to implement early comprehensive assessments of burnout syndrome among medical residents for early detection to curb the burnout phenomenon within healthcare systems.",

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between differences in parenting practices and internalizing problems in children and adolescents. Our study sample consisted of 554 children (288 boys and 266 girls) between 3 and 13 years of age who participated in the study. Their respective parents provided the information about them. The instruments used have been the Behavioral Assessment System for Children and Adolescents and parenting style, defined according to the Parental Parenting Questionnaire. The Parenting Questionnaire considers 7 factors: social and emotional support received by a mother or father, satisfaction with parenting, involvement, communication, limit setting, autonomy, and role orientation. The results showed that children with high scores in internalizing problems tended to have parents with low levels of support, limit setting, and autonomy, along with low levels of maternal satisfaction with parenting. A regression analysis was also conducted, producing a model capable of predicting 14% of the variance in internalizing problems. The model was based on the following parenting variables: maternal support, autonomy and satisfaction with parenting, and paternal limit setting and role orientation. Our results indicate that the information obtained is very useful for the design of parenting programs related to certain aspects of current educational practice. Furthermore, parents' responses to the instruments used revealed patterns of behavior that can be modified in both parents and children.",

    "abstract": "Research indicates that social media addiction is associated with several psychological consequences, for example, depression. Distressed individuals tend to devote more time to social media, which leads to impairment of daily life. Interestingly, individuals feeling more compassionate toward them tend to devote less time to social media and feel less psychologically distressed. This research aimed to examine the association between social media addiction and self-compassion and whether it can be further explained through the association of psychological distress.A sample of 255 Greek adults received a personal invitation sent to various social media platforms. Invitations included a link, which redirected participants to the information sheet and the study questionnaires, namely the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, the Self-Compassion Scale, and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale. Participation was voluntary and no benefit/reward was granted.As predicted, social media addiction was found to negatively correlate with self-compassion and positively with distress. We used structural equation modeling to examine associations between variables, with psychological distress acting as a mediator. Examination of estimated parameters in the model revealed statistically significant correlations, except for the positive dimensions of the Self-Compassion Scale, which were found to be insignificantly associated.Individuals with higher levels of self-compassion tend to report less social media additive behaviors and distress. The extensive use of social media is related to negative feelings and emotions. Self-compassion is a potential protective factor, while distress is a potential risk factor for social media addiction. Intervention programs dealing with social media addiction should consider the role of self-compassion.",

It was also reported that higher alexithymia scores are a predictive factor for a decrease in social functionality. It is known that patients with bipolar disorder experience more somatic symptoms than the general population. No study has yet been conducted on the interrelation of these 3 clinical domains, which are known to negatively affect the functionality and quality of life in bipolar disorder patients. This study included 72 bipolar disorder-1 patients. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was used to determine the emotional state of the patients, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale was used to determine the alexithymia scores, and the Somatization Scale was used to determine the somatization scores. As a result of hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis, the first model was found to be significant (P < .001), and the emotional dysregulation total scale score significantly predicted the Toronto Alexithymia Scale total scale score (P < .001). The second model was also found to be significant (P < .001), and the emotional dysregulation total scale score significantly predicted the somatization total scale score (P < .001). This study found that ED predicted alexithymia and somatization in euthymic bipolar patients.

    "abstract": "There is an active interest in understanding the relationship between mental disorders and modifiable and potentially preventable exposures. However, the complexity of the environment, involving many causal and noncausal pathways, makes research extremely challenging. To tackle these challenges, we have recently proposed the use of the exposome paradigm. The exposome represents the totality of exposures in a lifetime from conception onward. The framework offers a solution to handle the complexity of all \"non-genetic\" factors. The exposome approach has recently been adopted to construct an exposome score for schizophrenia (ES-SCZ). Findings demonstrate that ES-SCZ can be used for risk stratification, adjusting for cumulative environmental load in statistical testing, and collecting risk enriched cohorts. Increasing data availability will help improve ES-SCZ that can be used in staging models to enhance clinical characterization and outcome forecasting. Although an ES-SCZ already provides several practical benefits for research practice, the exposome paradigm offers much more. Agnostic exposure-wide analyses might be the first step to mapping the exposome of mental disorders. These analyses help distinguish genuine signals from selective reporting and uncover novel risk and resilience factors. The exposome approach will also increase our understanding of the differential impact of the environment on mental health across geographical settings and ethnic communities. We are in the early phases of exposome research in psychiatry; however, if successfully applied, exposome framework is poised to embrace complexity and enable advanced analytical solutions to harness ever-growing data to gain insight into the complex dynamic network of exposures.",

The study aimed to study the nature of religious coping of frontline healthcare workers seen through the perspective of gender, socio-economic status, and occupation. An online-based study was carried out among frontline healthcare workers involved in the care of COVID-19 patients (n = 200). Sociodemographic data form and the Brief Religious Coping scale were used in this study. There were more female healthcare workers (60.5%) and doctors (69.5% vs. 30.5%). Healthcare workers used more positive religious coping than negative religious coping (median score: 22 vs. 9). Positive religious coping was seen more in females (median score: 23 vs. 21, P = .015). Non-doctors applied positive coping more than doctors (median score: 26 vs. 21, P < .001). There were significant differences in positive religious coping scores across income groups, with the B40 group having the highest score (median score: 24). Post hoc pairwise comparison concluded that the B40 group had significantly higher positive religious coping scores than the M40 group. Positive coping was utilized more among female healthcare workers, nondoctors, and the lowest socio-economic group. As prior literature has shown that positive religious coping is desirable and has superior mental health outcomes, our findings show that more effort should be channeled into enhancing positive religious coping, particularly among male healthcare workers, doctors, and the middle and high socio-economic group.",

This narrative review aims to provide a global view on the neuropsychiatric consequences of COVID-19 that can be ascribed to several factors, ranging from the direct effect of infection, to the body's responses against the infection, or to the psychological sequelae of social isolation, unemployment, and fear for one's health and livelihood. Current findings show that the more severe the respiratory infection, the more likely are central nervous system (CNS) complications regarding the infection itself. The immune reactions to the infection may result in symptoms similar to chronic fatigue as well as neurocognitive deficits, which last long after the infection is gone. An increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma-related stress may also follow upon economic fears and isolation from friends and family. The consequences of the pandemic are not limited to adults; children learning remotely and away from classmates and routine activities may develop adjustment disorders, acute stress disorder, and a variety of manifestations of grief. A summary of case reports suggests that COVID-19-related stress, economic recession, and political unrest increase the risk of suicidal behaviors and acts of violence. However, it is unknown whether manifestations of mental disorders result from social causes or whether CNS complications may be responsible.",

The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran (EMBU), and Family Accommodation Scale-Patient Version (FAS-PV) questionnaires were administered to all participants. Patient OCI-R scores for checking, hoarding, obsessing, ordering, washing, neutralizing, and total OCI-R scores were significantly higher when compared with the control group (all P < .05). Patient CTQ scores for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, and total CTQ scores were significantly higher when compared with the control group (all P < .05). Patients' EMBU scores for F1, F2, F3, F5, F6, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and total EMBU scores were significantly higher when compared with the control group (all P < .05). There was no significant difference in the F4 scores between the 2 groups (P = .622). Patient FAS-PV scores for the direct participation and facilitation of OCD symptoms, avoidance of OCD triggers, taking on patient responsibilities, modification of personal responsibilities, and total FAS-PV scores were significantly higher when compared with the control group (all P < .05). The total OCI-R score showed a significant positive correlation with emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and total CTQ score (r = 0.564; r = 0.518; r = 0.542; r = 0.586; r = 0.603, all P < .05). The total OCI-R score showed a significant positive correlation with the scores for F1, F2, F3, F5, F6, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and the total EMBU score (r = 0.504; r = 0.531; r = 0.611; r = 0.466; r = 0.519; r = 0.665; r = 0.351; r = 0.597; r = 0.667; r = 0.484; r = 0.586; r = 0.662, all P < .05). The total OCI-R score showed a significant positive correlation with scores for direct participation and facilitation, avoidance of OCD triggers, taking on patient responsibilities, modification of personal responsibilities, and total FAS-PV score (r = 0.571; r = 0.624; r = 0.670; r = 0.592; r = 0.684, all P < .05). Our findings highlight the importance of adverse childhood experiences, parenting styles, and family accommodation on OCD patients. Importantly, these adverse experiences are closely related to the severity of symptoms in these patients. We suggest that psychological, and not only physiological, changes play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of OCD. This study confirmed that family and childhood experiences play an important role in the occurrence of OCD, and family education in childhood greatly affects the occurrence of OCD. Therefore, it can be inferred that good family psychological education in childhood has a positive effect on reducing the risk of OCD. If family psychological education can be included in community medical services, this will help to mitigate the development of mental health situations.",

    "abstract": "This study is to determine the possible pathophysiological parameters associated with the development of anxiety and impaired consciousness in patients with acute coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Descriptive pathophysiological and pathopsychological data was collected from 89 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 across 7 infectious hospitals, where 14 trainees in psychiatry and neurology collected data from December 2020 to June 2021. Contingency tables and logistic regression analyses were made to reveal associations and to detect predictors of patients' states of anxiety or impaired consciousness. Anxiety and impaired consciousness were observed in 28 patients (31.50%); 22 (25.00%) presented with anxiety symptoms, and 7 (7.90%) had impaired consciousness. The degree of their association was low (Fisher's exact = 0.675 (df = 1), P = .495). Different pathophysiological mechanisms were shown to determine the development of anxiety or impaired consciousness within COVID-19. Predictors of anxiety were oxygen saturation (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54; P = .021), cardiovascular disorders (OR = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.52; P = .003), disorders of the nervous system (OR = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.84; P = .038), and urogenital system (OR = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.87; P = .035). The predictive power of the model was 80.23% (P ≤ .001). The development of impaired consciousness was associated with age (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21; P = .025) and C-reactive protein level (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04; P = .060), and the predictive power of the model was 94.52% (P ≤ .001). The prevalence of psychopathological disorders associated with acute COVID-19 was high: n = 28 (31.50%) for anxiety and impaired consciousness. Moreover, a 1.00% increase in the saturation index was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in the patient's risk of developing anxiety. Thus, anxiety symptoms may be considered within a personality rather than an infectious-inflammatory response to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Theories on Alzheimer disease pathogenesis propose a gap between pathological changes and the onset of clinical symptoms. The early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for the implementation of preventive strategies. Mild cognitive impairment is a transitional stage and an accurate diagnosis is vital. However, the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment varies due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of comprehensive neuropsychological criteria, including all cognitive domains, for diagnosing cognitive impairment in clinical settings. The study included 509 subjects with subjective cognitive complaints between 2017 and 2021. They were diagnosed using the conventional and neuropsychological criteria, and the results were named the complex criteria (conventional criteria-neuropsychological criteria). Concordance between the conventional and neuropsychological diagnostic criteria diagnoses was 87.82%. Some participants diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia using the conventional criteria were classified as normal according to the neuropsychological criteria. Notably, the mild cognitive impairment - normal cognition (MCI-NC) and dementia (DEM)-NC (normal cognition) groups exhibited distinct characteristics. The MCI-NC group had higher depression scores (P = .008) and better memory performance (P = .026) and executive function (P = .020) than the MCI-MCI group. The DEM-NC group had better instrumental activities of daily living (P < .001) than the DEM-DEM group. This study highlights the complexity of diagnosing cognitive impairment and the importance of comprehensive criteria. Relying solely on conventional criteria may lead to overdiagnosis. The neuropsychological criteria consider various cognitive domains and better discriminate between individuals with MCIs or other factors that contribute to cognitive difficulties.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to assess the effectiveness of an optimized emergency green channel in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and its effect on emergency response time, effectiveness, anxiety, and acute stress. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 349 AIS patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis from January 2019 to May 2022. The patients were divided into those who received optimized emergency green channel treatment (155) and those who did not (194). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the admission pathways, living conditions, insurance methods, and residential locations of the 2 patient groups. The key metrics comprised the times from onset to admission, admission to computed tomography (CT), CT to thrombolysis, admission to thrombolysis (door-to-needle time (DNT)), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at various intervals post thrombolysis, heart rate, blood pressure, and scores in Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ). Post PSM, 118 patients were analyzed (54 control and 64 observation). The observation group showed significantly lower time results than the control group, which included the following: the time from onset to admission (t = 31.428, P < .001), door-to-imaging time (t = 27.317, P < .001), imaging-to-needle time (t = 20.951, P < .001, and DNT (t = 25.954, P < .001). Significant differences were observed in 24 hour-post thrombolysis NIHSS scores, heart rate, blood pressure, SAS, and SASRQ scores (P < .05) but not in NIHSS scores at 7 and 30 days. The optimized emergency green channel process effectively reduced the treatment time for ischemic stroke patients, improved rescue efficiency, and positively influenced the psychological stress levels of patients post treatment.",

    "abstract": "To prevent eating disorders in future physicians, this umbrella review and meta-analysis of previous meta-analyses estimates the prevalence of disordered eating (DE) among medical students worldwide and identifies key risk factors. Four databases were searched electronically between their inception and February 1, 2023. The search was later updated to December 31, 2023. The search yielded prevalence rates for medical students who scored above established cutoffs on validated assessment measures for DE. These were computed to provide an overall pooled estimate. The data was taken from 2 previous reviews. Both these systematic reviews found a 15.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.7%-15.6%) prevalence rate of DE among medical students. The equivalent Hedges' G = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.29-0.31), the equivalent odds ratio = 1.74 (95% CI: 1.71-1.77), I2 = 97.6%, and the excess of statistical significance is P = .001. The trim and fill adjusted effect size was 16.0% (95% CI: 14.0%-20.0%). Because eating disorders put students' safety and well-being at risk and because the health of early-stage physicians is vital to the welfare of a country, early signs of disordered eating must become a priority of medical schools and a signal for effective prevention and intervention. The recommendation is to ensure supportive environments, provide easy access to effective care, and hold clear expectations for student eating behavior.",

    "abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity of dissociation constitutes a challenge to the culture-sensitive clinician. Variability in experiencing dissociation, the interplay between acute and chronic conditions, and the predominance of a nosologically interface-type of clinical surface conceal core dissociative symptoms. While the latter (amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, identity confusion, and identity alteration) usually remain underreported, the clinical surface may be dominated by acute (functional neurological symptoms, brief psychosis, an experience of possession, or acute dissociative reaction to a stressful event) or chronic (mood and personality disorders) secondary syndromes. However, these syndromes also constitute gateways in pursuing the clues of core dissociation. Given that culture influences communication between clinician and patient, accurate expression of mental content requires the idiomatic armamentarium describing the experience. The latter is problematic in dealing with phenomena of core dissociation while the secondary representations have a relatively universal character for both clinicians and patients. Nevertheless, this approach requires a transdiagnostic understanding in conceiving this clinical interface. This interface reflects, in fact, complications of dissociative disorders which require to be addressed in the first line. This is either due to the medical and psychiatric urgency (e.g., functional neurological symptoms, brief psychosis) or due to resistance to treatment (e.g., antidepressant pharmacotherapy) which seem to be indicated for the particular condition. This transdiagnostic schema is based on a combined utilization of etic and emic principles in the cultural understanding of psychiatric disorders. Namely, universal medical-psychiatric categories are conceived as tools of communication and mutual understanding rather than being mere appearances or primary disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Young children and their caregivers have faced an increased risk of developing mental health difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. However, very little is still known about the mental health of children younger than 6 years. Existing research suggests that families with caregiver/s who are healthcare workers may be at increased risk. The primary purpose of the paper is to report on the mental health difficulties experienced by young children and their caregivers in Turkey and to investigate if mental health outcomes are worse for young children and caregivers who are healthcare workers in comparison to non-healthcare workers during the first year of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. An online survey was completed by 158 caregivers of children aged 1-5 years during December 2020 in Turkey. Caregivers reported on pandemic related experiences, child and parent mental health. Up to 30% of caregivers reported their child was experiencing moderate to severe anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances. Between 36.2% and 39.2% of caregivers reported moderate to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress symptoms. Multivariate analysis of covariance analyses found no significant differences between the healthcare worker and non-healthcare worker groups for child(F(4,131) = 1.037, P >.05) or parent mental health outcomes (F(3,141) = 0.712, P >.05). Our study showed that one-third of children and their caregivers experienced mental health problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic unrelated to the caregiver's occupation in the health sector. It is important that all families with young children have access to mental health support during disruptive events.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Dark Future Scale that measures future anxiety. The sample consisted of 478 university students aged 18-25 and used convenience sampling. They completed an online survey about sociodemographics, tobacco use, and life satisfaction, Dark Future Scale and Trait Anxiety Inventory-2 Trait Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach alpha values were used to test scale's structural validity and reliability. For convergent validity, we correlated the Turkish version of the Dark Future Scale with trait anxiety and examined the mean differences in smoking status and its association with life satisfaction. Majority of the participants were female (73.6%), with a mean age of 21.5 (SD = 1.67). Majority (53.6%) were regular tobacco users. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis revealed a 1-factor solution to be most optimal (χ 2 = 17.091, df = 4, P = .002, χ2/df = 4.3, and root-mean-square error = 0.083, comparative fit index = 0.988, general fit index = 0.986, The Adjusted Goodness of Fit (AGFI) = 0.986, normalized fit index = 0.985). The alpha value for the scale reliability was 0.86. Turkish version of the Dark Future Scale was also significantly and positively correlated with trait anxiety (r(478) = .67, P <.01). Exploration of the association between smoking status and Turkish version of the Dark Future Scale showed that the mean score was significantly higher among smokers (M = 19.1, SD = 6.65) than nonsmokers (M = 17.7, SD = 7.69). Lastly, higher future anxiety was associated with lower life satisfaction (r(478) = -0.42, P < .01). Turkish version of the Dark Future Scale is a reliable and valid scale to measure future anxiety. A brief and easy to apply, reliable, and valid future anxiety measure may be useful for many researchers in psychology and psychiatry.",

The inadequacy of diagnostic tests specific to MDD causes difficulty in diagnosis. Therefore, we investigated the situation of thiol/disulfide imbalance, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, in MDD patients. Forty-five MDD patients and 40 non-patient volunteers participated in our study. Sociodemographic data form, Beck Depression Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale were used in making the diagnosis and evaluation process. There was a significant difference between the MDD and non-patient groups in native thiol and total thiol levels, disulfide/native thiol, disulfide/total thiol, and native thiol/total thiol ratios. No significant difference was detected in terms of disulfide level between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference between the patients' thiol disulfide ratios and the severity of depression. There was no significant difference between the patients' symptom duration and thiol disulfide ratios. Nevertheless, a negative correlation was identified between the duration of the patients' symptoms and their disulfide levels. When the results were examined in terms of thiol and disulfide ratios, they showed that thiol and disulfide ratios were impaired in depression. We think that thiol/disulfide parameters may be a biomarker candidate that can help in the diagnosis of MDD.",

Existing scales often do not consider relevant cultural factors, creating a gap in psychological research. This study aimed to address this gap by introducing the \"Psychological Maturity Scale\" designed to be culturally sensitive. This study used a cross-sectional design to develop and validate the scale across diverse age groups, involving 2 sample groups of 194 and 213 individuals. The study included exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and reliability and validity tests. The scale was also compared with established metrics like the Life Satisfaction and Positive-Negative Affect Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. The research yielded a 4-dimensional model to understand psychological maturity, represented by the acronym SAFE, which stands for Self-Awareness, Autonomy, Flexibility, and Ego Resilience. The findings indicated that the scale is valid and reliable. Additionally, it was concluded that the dimensions of the developed scale are consistent with theoretical explanations. This scale is more than just an assessment tool; it serves as a culturally sensitive framework and is a crucial, fine-tuned instrument for future psychological research.",

The arithmetic group was educated to understand the addition and subtraction formulas, then wrote down the correct answers between the number of 20 and 100. The drawing writing group was guided to name, draw, and write a given object. Both were trained by therapist for 12 weeks (40 minutes per week). Blinded assessors measured global cognitive function, communication skills, and quality of life using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, the subscales of Functional Assessment of Communication Skills scale and Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease scale at baseline and after 12 weeks' intervention. After the 12-week intervention, the participants with mild-to-moderate dementia of the arithmetic writing group and the drawing writing group showed statistically significant improvement in communication skills and quality of life compared with the control group (social communication: 6.00 ± 0.69 vs. 6.06 ± 0.92 vs. 3.98 ± 1.33; basic needs communication: 6.32 ± 0.48 vs. 6.42 ± 0.53 vs. 4.25 ± 1.49; quality of life: 33.23 ± 5.34 vs. 34.07 ± 3.49 vs. 25.07 ± 2.60). In addition, MMSE scores of the arithmetic group tended to improve after the 12-week intervention (14.77 ± 3.06 vs. 17.31 ± 4.80, P < .01), but stabled in drawing writing group (14.27 ± 4.28 vs. 14.53 ± 5.26, P > .05) and significant decreased in the control group (13.73 ± 2.58 vs. 10.13 ± 3.23, P < .01). Arithmetic, drawing, and writing are effective in improving communication skills and quality of life; arithmetic also could delay the decline of cognitive function in people with mild-to-moderate dementia.",

    "abstract": "The connection between chronic inflammation and the quality of life (QOL) in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia lacks clarity. This study aimed to achieve 2 primary objectives: (1) assess the QOL among outpatients with schizophrenia and (2) explore the potential correlation between reduced QOL and heightened levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with schizophrenia. The research included 129 outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were receiving care at the psychiatry department of the University Hospital Mohamed VI in Marrakech, Morocco. Disease severity was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), while the QOL was measured using the Moroccan Arabic version of The Schizophrenia Quality of Life questionnaire. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on their CRP levels: normal CRP (≤5.0 mg/L) and high CRP (>5.0 mg/L). A comparative analysis of sociodemographic, clinical, biological, and quality of life factors was conducted between the 2 groups (normal CRP and high CRP). The group with elevated CRP levels exhibited higher scores in various PANSS categories, including PANSS total score (P ≤ .01), PANSS positive score (P ≤ .01), PANSS negative score (P ≤ .01), and PANSS general score (P ≤ .01). After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables, individuals with elevated CRP levels demonstrated lower QOL compared to those with normal CRP levels (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.46-0.68). Significant associations were noted between male gender (OR = 0.047, 95% CI = 0.01-0.26), earlier onset of the condition (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.33-0.82), current tobacco smoking (OR = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.00-0.08), and heightened CRP levels. Our study suggests that higher CRP is associated with lower QOL levels in schizophrenia.",

Ketamine, traditionally recognized for its anesthetic properties, has emerged as a novel and promising avenue for the treatment of SUD. This narrative review critically examines the current body of literature surrounding the use of ketamine in various forms and settings for individuals grappling with substance abuse. The review explores the neurobiological underpinnings of ketamine's potential therapeutic effects in SUD, shedding light on its impact on glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuroplasticity, and reward pathways. Special attention is given to the psychotropic and dissociative properties of ketamine, exploring their implications for both therapeutic outcomes and patient experience. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding ketamine's role in the treatment of SUD, emphasizing the need for further research and clinical exploration. As we navigate the complex terrain of addiction medicine, understanding the nuances of ketamine's potential in SUD holds promise for the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies.",

Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to normal groups (NG) and treatment groups (TG), with 40 participants in each group. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and 24-Item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24) were used to evaluate the effect of Qi Gong fitness on alleviating stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms in underprivileged working youth. There was no significant difference in demographic outcome indicators between NG and TG. The main analytic results showed significant differences (P < .05) in the intra- and inter-group comparisons of NG and TG in stress, anxiety, and depression before and after intervention. When compared with prior intervention, NG and TG after intervention showed more favorable scores in PSS, GAD-7, and HAMD-24, among which PSS (NG: 51.61 ± 4.32 vs. 29.80 ± 3.08; TG: 55.21 ± 5.41 vs. 15.85 ± 2.25; P < .01), GAD-7 (NG: 10.83 ± 2.45 vs. 9.85 ± 2.52; TG: 12.23 ± 1.90 vs. 7.84 ± 1.57; P < .01), and HAMD-24 (NG: 10.83 ± 2.45 vs. 9.85 ± 2.52; TG: 25.63 ± 3.94 vs. 11.40 ± 3.82; P < .01); These results indicate that NG and TG have significant effects on alleviating occupational stress, anxiety, and depression in young underprivileged people.

This study also explores how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure history, vaccination status, sleep quality, and alcohol dependency symptoms influence mental health outcomes. The data were collected from 1049 Chinese people through Tencent using a structured questionnaire utilizing convenience sampling technique. The online cross-sectional study included the Chinese version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol dependency, fear of COVID-19, and sleep quality, respectively. Statistical analyses included independent sample t-tests and χ 2 tests to assess the differences in study variables across demographic characteristics, and multiple linear regressions to assess the effect of the experience of COVID-19 infection, vaccination, and mental health variables on sleep quality and alcohol dependency. Results showed that 11.5% to 32.4% of the participants had a poor mental health symptoms. Males had significantly higher depressive symptoms (χ 2 = 12.283, df = 4, P = .015) and alcohol dependency symptoms (χ 2 = 66.604, df = 3, P < .001), and females had significantly lower mental well-being (χ 2 = 12.742, df = 2, P = .002). Additionally, findings showed that stress (β = .250, P < .001), mental well-being (β = -.166, P < .001), and fear of COVID-19 (β = .061, P = .029) predicted poorer sleep quality, and anxiety (β = .115, P = .035) and mental well-being (β = -.097, P = .002) predicted alcohol dependency symptoms. Since the pandemic-induced mental health challenges persist for a prolonged period, the findings of these relationships offer guidance for mental health professionals to formulate therapeutic interventions to help people cope with psychological crises.",

We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 4088 pregnant women at a maternal-child health hospital in China from January to December 2022. During the first trimester, we assessed depression, anxiety, and stress levels using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pregnancy outcomes were monitored, and univariate and multiple logistic analyses were performed to identify the risk factors. These factors were then used to develop a nomogram model. Significant differences were found in maternal age, number of embryonic arrests, history of abortion, assisted reproduction, and environmental exposure between the SA group (n = 302) and the normal pregnancy group (n = 3786). After adjusting for potential confounders, higher scores on the DASS-21 subscales were independently associated with an increased risk of SA: Depression (OR [Odds Ratio] = 1.54, 95% CI [Confidence Interval]: 1.39-1.71, P < .001), Anxiety (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.44-1.80, P < .001), and Stress (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.31-2.20, P < .001). The model achieved a concordance index of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) and demonstrated a well-fitted calibration curve, indicating its good clinical applicability. Our findings indicate that mental health conditions are significantly associated with an increased risk of SA. The nomogram model also demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, indicating its potential usefulness in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Saudi Arabian adults face high rates of depression, stress, and anxiety. Self-stigma complicates the situation, hindering timely treatment and resulting in adverse outcomes. This study examined the prevalence of these mental health conditions and self-stigma among adults and their association with sociodemographic factors in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia. The findings will inform targeted interventions and support for better mental health understanding in the region. This cross-sectional study included 1056 participants aged ≥18 years. Convenient sampling was used, and participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire comprising 49 questions. The questionnaire covered demographics, mental illnesses (assessed through the depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 [DASS-21] questionnaire), and self-stigmatizing attitudes toward the measured mental conditions (measured using the self-stigma of depression scale [SSDS] questionnaire). The majority of the 1056 participants were Saudi nationals living in the Jazan region, with a mean age of 29 years. The participants' mental health data revealed a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (55%, 56%, and 39%, respectively). The DASS-21 questionnaire results revealed varying degrees of depression (normal: 45%, mild: 12%, moderate: 20%, severe: 8%, extremely severe: 15%), anxiety (normal: 44%, mild: 7%, moderate: 18%, severe: 8%, extremely severe: 23%), and stress (normal: 60%, mild: 11%, moderate: 11%, severe: 10%, extremely severe: 7%). The mean self-stigmatization score reported was 52 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 17), with 540 (51%) participants having stigma and 513 (49%) with low levels of stigma. The relationship assessment between stigma and depression, anxiety, and stress revealed that levels of stigma were higher in normal individuals than in those having depression, anxiety, or stress. Regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between mental health variables, self-stigmatization, and other factors. The analysis revealed that urban residence and the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower levels of self-stigmatization. This research highlighted the high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress, along with self-stigmatization in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Recommendations include increasing awareness, improving access to services, promoting early intervention, enhancing community support, combating self-stigma, and conducting further research to confirm generalizability. Targeted interventions and public health strategies are needed to promote mental well-being and address this burden in Jazan.",

    "abstract": "Background: Evidence is scarce on the mechanisms involved in the relationship between dietary inflammatory index and mental health in adolescents. This study aimed to assess the association between children-DII (C-DII) and depressive and anxiety disorder symptoms in adolescents and to explore whether inflammation and cardiometabolic risk factors mediate this association. Methods: The study was conducted at the Ankara City Hospital Pediatrics Polyclinic and 304 adolescents. In cross-sectional study, adolescents were asked general information questions. Anthropometric measurements were performed and some biochemical parameters and inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP)) were obtained. The C-DII score was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Depression and anxiety levels of the participants were assessed by self-report. Structural equation modelling analyzed how cardiometabolic risk factors and inflammation mediate the relationship between mental health and dietary inflammation. Results: C-DII scores were positively associated with depression and anxiety score (β [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.224 [0.08–0.25] for depression; 0.923 [0.04–1.67] for anxiety). Except for dietary inflammation with anxiety in girls, these relationships remained statistically significant in all subgroups by sex. It was determined that CRP partially mediated the relationship between dietary inflammation and depression and anxiety. It was determined that body mass index (BMI)-z score and waist circumference (WC) mediated the relationship between dietary inflammation and depression scores. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the higher pro-inflammatory potential of diet is associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety, and this association may be mediated by CRP for depression and anxiety, WC, and BMI-z score for only depression. Further research is required to verify our findings and clarify the latent mechanism in larger populations.",

The search time limit was from the establishment of the database to December, 2023. The included results were integrated and analyzed, and ReviewManager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 13 studies with a total of 504 depression patients were included. Compared with the control group, auricular acupressure showed a significant reduction in depression scores, as reflected in the Hamilton Depression Scale (standardized mean difference [SMD] = –1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: –2.25~–0.75); risk rate [RR] = 1.96, 95% CI: 0.66~5.82), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SMD = –0.91, 95% CI: –1.15~–0.67), and Patient Health Questionnaire scores (SMD = –0.94, 95% CI: –1.46~–0.41; all p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The meta-analysis suggested that auricular acupoint therapy is safe and effective in treating depression, and can reduce Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores. There were no obvious adverse reactions. This therapy could therefore be used as a complementary therapeutic approach for patients with depression.",

The glutamate cell signaling pathway associated with alcohol has been reported to be one of the main pathologies of AUD. Previous studies have suggested that FYN, which is known to control NMDA glutamate receptor function through phosphorylation, might be associated with AUD. Method: The present study included 354 subjects in the alcohol-dependent group and 139 subjects in the control group. The alcohol-dependent group was recruited from five university hospitals and a psychiatric hospital, and the control group was recruited from people who visited the university hospital for routine medical checkups in Korea. FYN gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were selected based on SNP databases and previous studies of the FYN gene. Ten SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. Results: GG genotypes and G allele frequencies of rs1058134 in male AUD patients were significantly lower than in controls (p = 0.003). AA genotypes and A allele frequencies of rs12191154 in female AUD patients were significantly lower than in controls (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.003). In female AUD patients, AA genotypes and A allele frequencies of rs9387025 were significantly higher than in controls (p = 0.003). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the FYN gene may be a candidate gene for AUD. This may help for the planning of further studies to determine the function of each SNP and the exact relationship between the FYN gene and AUD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Stathmin1 (Stmn1) is a protein highly expressed during the development of the central nervous system. The phosphorylation of Stmn1 involves microtubule dynamics, so Stmn1 plays a vital part in neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Previous studies reported that Stmn1 genetic variants influence fear and anxiety as well as cognitive-affective processing. However, no study reported on the relationship between Stmn1 gene polymorphism and cognition in Chinese. Thus, this association was investigated in the present study. Methods: A total of 129 healthy Han Chinese were genotyped for Stmn1 rs182455 polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Cognitive function was assessed using the Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). Results: In the present sample, rs182455 CC, CT, and TT genotypes were found in 56 (43.41%), 65 (50.39%) and 8 (6.20%) cases, respectively. The genotype distribution did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ2 = 3.715, p = 0.054). Significant differences were found between the three rs182455 genotypes and between the CC and (CT+TT) genotype groups in the Stroop Color (SC) scores of the SCWT (F = 3.322, 2.377; p = 0.039, 0.019, respectively) and the total recall (TR) scores on the HVLT-R (F = 3.118, 2.225; p = 0.048, 0.028, respectively). There was a female-specific difference in SC scores between the three rs182455 genotypes (F = 2.318, p = 0.023). The rs182455 genotype distribution showed no significant difference between two sexes (χ2 = 1.313, p = 0.519), whereas significant differences were seen in SC and TR scores between two sexes (t = –2.294, –2.490; p = 0.023, 0.014, respectively). Conclusions: The findings suggest that rs182455 Stmn1 polymorphism might affect cognitive flexibility and immediate free recall in healthy Chinese individuals, especially females.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neurosyphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum invading the nervous system, can lead to severe neurological complications across all stages of syphilis. Misdiagnosis is common, exacerbated by overlapping psychiatric conditions and diagnostic limitations. This study aims to improve the understanding and management of neurosyphilis in psychiatric settings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Methods: A retrospective study used data from the Chinese Case Report System (CCRS) spanning 2014–2018. Four municipal psychiatric hospitals in Guangdong were chosen based on syphilis rates and psychiatric patient volumes. Sociodemographic data, syphilis history, symptoms, diagnostic and treatment details, and laboratory results were reviewed. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assessed psychopathology symptoms. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using BPRS scores before and after standard treatment. Diagnoses followed national guidelines, with statistical analyses performed using logistic regression and t-tests. Results: Out of 69,436 psychosis patients screened, 1588 were diagnosed with syphilis, with 262 (16.5%) of these cases identified as neurosyphilis. Syphilis prevalence mildly declined from 2.8% (2014) to 2.0% (2016), while neurosyphilis cases increased marginally from 0.34% (2014) to 0.39% (2018). Confirmatory Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) tests were conducted in only 30.2% of neurosyphilis cases. Standard therapy was administered to 66.8% of patients, with significantly better outcomes in confirmed cases (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Diagnosing and treating neurosyphilis in Guangdong’s psychiatric hospitals remains challenging. Accurate diagnosis and standardized treatment protocols are essential to effectively manage both syphilis and associated mental health complications caused by neurosyphilis.",

Methods: Clinical studies and a randomized controlled trial were identified via PubMed database and included in this review. Results: The search, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 13 human studies and 3 animal studies. Nine human studies compared brain activity and connectivity between regions in PD patients. Neural activity in the amygdala was highlighted in six studies. The hippocampus had higher activation in PD patients compared to those with social phobia, but generally showed less activity compared to healthy controls. The parahippocampal gyrus and thalamus exhibited greater activation in PD patients than healthy controls. Activity in the prefrontal cortices was also noted, particularly the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Other regions involved included the dorsal midbrain, left brainstem (showing hyperactivation), S1, and right caudate, which showed increased activity in PD patients. The left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) exhibited hypoactivation in response to predictable cues compared to unpredictable or neutral cues within the default mode network (DMN). Three animal studies suggested that electrical and chemical activation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) in rats elicited fight-or-flight behaviors, providing a model for panic attacks. Conclusions: Neuroimaging studies suggest several key regions involved in PD pathophysiology, including the brainstem, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, insula, and prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Hypersensitivity in the brainstem and amygdala plays a role in activating the fear network. Further prospective studies are needed to identify the neuroanatomical sites involved in PD and fear circuitry.",

Self-esteem can hinge upon a narrow or broad set of factors, depending on how the adolescent conceptualizes the self. The present study examines how narrow and broad views of self may be differentially related to measures of depression severity and suicide risk among adolescents. Methods: In total, 90 adolescent psychiatric inpatients were evaluated while hospitalized during a major depressive episode. All patients completed the Children’s Depression Inventory, the Hopelessness Scale for Children, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Self-Esteem Worksheet—an idiographic measure that allows each person to rate the importance and success related to enter their personal values and priorities. Results: Compared to depressed adolescent inpatients, depressed and suicidal teens reported significantly higher levels of depression and hopelessness, along with significantly lower levels of self-esteem on both measures of self-esteem. Further, lower scores on the Self-Esteem Worksheet were associated with more severe depression, elevated hopelessness, and elevated suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The Self-Esteem Worksheet provides insights into the mind of vulnerable teens that may help to guide treatment and prevention efforts.",

This study aimed to use the Alternative Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) to associate specific maladaptive PTs with experienced DD and to describe differences in the constellation of PTs between people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) and type 2 diabetes (PWT2D). Methods: A total of 358 participants with diabetes mellitus (DM) (56.2% female, mean age 42.33 years, standard deviation (SD) = 14.33) were evaluated using the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) and the shortened 160-item version of the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5). Psychometric properties of the DDS were evaluated first, then the association between DDS and PID-5 scores, and the differences between groups based on diabetes type and DD level, were analyzed. Results: Strong associations were found between the PID-5 Negative Affectivity (NEF) domain and the emotional burden (β = 0.852, pHolm &lt; 0.001) and regimen distress (β = 0.435, pHolm = 0.006) DDS subscale scores. PWT1D had a higher level of personality pathology than PWT2D, as did participants with elevated levels of DD across most domains and facets of PID-5. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that attention should be paid to the level of NEF among people with diabetes in relation to their emotional burden and perception of regimen distress. We recommend a distinction between people based on their diabetes type. Implications for clinical practice and interventions for DD perceived through the lens of the dimensional DSM-5 PT model are discussed.",

The purpose is to investigate the effectiveness of the Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program (VB-MAPP)-based family-intensive behavioral intervention in enhancing the language abilities of children with ASD. This study provides insights to help ASD children better cope with daily life. Methods: From September 2020 to September 2022, a total of 85 clinically diagnosed children with ASD and 30 age- and sex-matched children without ASD were recruited. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and VB-MAPP were used for evaluating and determining individualized intervention programs for children with ASD. The intervention lasted 6 months. Results: There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between children with ASD and children without ASD (all p &gt; 0.05), except for the mother’s age. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in all VB-MAPP scores among children with ASD (all p &lt; 0.001), compared with the baseline VB-MAPP total score and 16 domain scores. Tests of noninferiority showed that children with ASD at post-intervention were non-inferior to children without ASD in the Visual Perceptual Skills and Matching-to-Sample (VP/MTS) score (p = 0.001), play score (p = 0.034), reading score (p &lt; 0.001), and writing score (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Family-intensive behavioral intervention significantly improved the skills of children with ASD, as assessed by the VB-MAPP. These findings emphasize the importance of family intervention and provide further support for proposing a family intervention program for children with ASD that is suitable for China’s national conditions.",

Lockdowns are the usual methods of responding to these public health emergencies. However, the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on self-harm remains poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of self-harm. The findings may inform future policy development and strategies for managing pandemic-related mental health challenges. A meta-analysis was conducted using several database searches: APA PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wan Fang. Published studies with data on the incidence of self-harm during visits to medical institutions, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, were included. The pooled risk ratio (RR) value of self-harm incidence variation before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period, expressed as the comparison of clinical institution visits before and during the pandemic, was calculated. Fifteen retrospective cohort studies with observational designs involving 253,600 participants were included. The pooled RR value of self-harm incidence variation was 1.386 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.205-1.595, I2 = 58.9%, p = 0.002). The subgroup analysis showed that \"emergency department type\" (p = 0.004) and \"mean age of the sample\" were the sources of the RR values' heterogeneity (p = 0.026). Our findings suggest that the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was a risk factor for self-harm. Therefore, special attention should be paid to individuals visiting the emergency department and the middle-aged and elderly populations.

This protocol details the comprehensive evaluation of a new SARA service within the Royal Darwin Hospital located in remote and regional Australia. Located in the Northern Territory (NT) there are just 17 specialised mental health beds per 100,000 compared to the national average of 27 per 100,000. There have been no previous evaluations of SARA services in regional and remote Australian settings, therefore their acceptability and potential effects on consumer outcomes in these unique settings is unknown. This study protocol attempts to address this knowledge gap. A mixed method study with triangulation and including mirror methodology. A service evaluation protocol is proposed to be conducted over an initial 12 months period with a mirror image component to enable comparison of consumer outcomes prior to the service inception. The service evaluation is guided by the \"Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance\" (RE-AIM) framework and utilized both qualitative and quantitative measures to comprehensively describe the service. Results will include both qualitative and quantitative data using the \"R\", \"E\" and \"A\" component (Reach, Effectiveness and Adoption) of the RE-AIM framework. Emergency departments (EDs) are not well suited to persons experiencing mental health crisis and efforts need to be made to improve the delivery of service as well as patient flow. Minimizing wait times in ED is paramount. SARA is an innovative model of care that may address some of these issues. Evaluating its performance across a range of measures is key to improving and progressing the service. The unique context of the service location which has a large First Nations population and its remote setting adds further weight to the need to understand this model within this geographical context.",

Cyberbullying has also increased during the last decade due to the growing use of the internet, mobile technological tools, and social network systems. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors of traditional school bullying and cyberbullying. The sample comprised 5491 adolescents (53.7% male and 46.3% female) from Grades 7 to 12 in 15 public schools. Participants were administered a self-report survey, including sociodemographics, school bullying, cyberbullying, and related variables. A logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors related to school bullying and cyberbullying involvement. Boys were more prone to be perpetrators or victim-perpetrators of both school and cyberbullying. The results revealed that carrying a cutting tool, short sleep duration, using the computer and mobile phone longer, and poor academic performance were risk factors for being a perpetrator (p < 0.05). In addition, school bullying involvement was related to thin or overweight body perception (p < 0.001). Regression analysis indicated that being a victim or perpetrator of school bullying showed more significant risks for being a victim or perpetrator of cyberbullying (p < 0.001). We found common risk factors for both types of bullying and an overlap between school bullying and cyberbullying. These findings should be considered for developing new intervention programs and policies for preventing bullying in Turkey.",

This study also assesses the relationship between CSP/CV and some clinical findings in patients with schizophrenia. 190 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who underwent neuroanatomical evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging during inpatient treatment were included in the study. A personal data form, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were given to each patient at admission and discharge. The presence or absence of CSP/CV was recorded as \"yes\" or \"no\". The presence of CSP/CV was found to be associated with the number of hospital admissions, the number of electroconvulsive therapy sessions received, PANSS total score at admission, PANSS total score at discharge and clozapine use. In the logistic regression model created, the presence of CSP and total PANSS score were found to predict clozapine prescribing (respectively p = 0.001, p = 0.016).

This review scrutinizes the biological factors that predispose patients with SCZ to MetS, among which, genetic predisposition, dietary and lifestyle modifications, and the use of antipsychotic drugs (APs) play a significant role. The metabolic side effects of APs have been well studied. While studies have shed light on potential interventions to manage MetS in patients with SCZ, identifying precise biological targets to treat SCZ remains challenging. Therefore, further studies are warranted to enhance our comprehension of the intricate mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of patients with SCZ to MetS. These studies will be crucial in developing effective, targeted therapeutic strategies to treat MetS in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is recommended by major health organizations for trauma treatment, but its efficacy for borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains unestablished. This study aims to evaluate EMDR's effectiveness in treating BPD through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and compare its outcomes with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A total of 76 individuals participated in the RCT, with 18 patients (78% female) completing the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either EMDR (n = 8) or CBT (n = 10) via teletherapy sessions. Trauma symptoms were assessed using the international trauma questionnaire (ITQ), BPD symptoms were assessed using the Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Features Scale (PAI-BOR), and post-traumatic growth (PTG) was assessed using the post-traumatic growth inventory (PTGI). Additionally, attentional evaluations were conducted at behavioral and electroencephalographic levels through an oddball paradigm. A final comparison was made between a participant who did not complete the therapeutic process and a participant who did. Both EMDR and CBT treatments significantly improved trauma and BPD symptoms, as well as post-traumatic growth. The effect size was moderate for ITQ (η2 = 0.615) and PTGI (η2 = 0.610), and low for PAI-BOR (η2 = 0.147). Symptomatic participants showed a decrease in ITQ (p = 0.006) and PAI-BOR (p = 0.047) scores, and an increase in PTGI scores (p = 0.028). Both EMDR and CBT significantly improved trauma and BPD symptoms, as well as post-traumatic growth. Additionally, EMDR showed benefits in response accuracy and speed, with a correct response rate of 97% when comparing two participants (with and without therapy). However, completely clean electroencephalography (EEG) data were not obtained from both participants for a deeper comparison.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to establish the validity and reliability of a fear of failure scale for adolescents. The study involved 279 secondary school students enrolled in the 2020-2021 academic year. Internal consistency, item-total score correlation, and split-half methods were used to determine reliability, while exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were employed to determine validity. The two split-in-half method calculations found a Guttman Split-in-Half coefficient of 0.855 and a Spearman-Brown coefficient of 0.857. Cronbach's Alpha was 0.802 for the first half (items 1-9) and 0.774 for the second half (items 10-17). CFA analyses showed that a three-factor solution fit the data, but some goodness-of-fit indices fell below acceptable levels. To improve the model, error covariances of certain items were correlated based on modification indices. The final values were Minimum Discrepancy of Confirmatory Factor Analysis/Degrees of Freedom (CMIN/df) = 2.727, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) = 0.911, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0.863, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.673, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.079, χ2 = 160.9, Degrees of Freedom (DF) = 59. Factor loadings ranged from 0.52 to 0.83 for the first factor, 0.68 to 0.85 for the second factor, and 0.55 to 0.84 for the third factor. The fear of failure scale is a reliable and valid measurement tool. A review of the existing literature revealed a lack of scales that assess the physical, emotional, and thought dimensions of fear of failure among individuals aged 11-14 years. This gap underscores the potential for measurement-based research in this domain. Through this study, a valid and reliable scale was developed to evaluate fear of failure in adolescents within the 11-14 year-age range, thereby addressing this critical need.",

    "abstract": "Background: Personality disorders are complex mental disorders characterized by interpersonal difficulties and are notoriously difficult to treat. Inpatient treatment offers patients the opportunity to establish therapeutic alliances, which can help alleviate their clinical dilemmas. However, there is currently a lack of research that takes the perspective of inpatients as the main subject. This study aims to delve into the significant events experienced by inpatients with personality disorders from their own perspective and explore their significance and impact on the individuals. Methods: Nine inpatients with personality disorders at different stages of hospitalization from a psychiatric specialty hospital were selected for semi-structured interviews. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data. Results: In the context of hospitalization, the significant events that patients experienced mainly include the ‘giving’ and empowerment by therapists, the contained and holding hospital environment, supportive relationships with peer patients, and the biopsychosocial impact of medication on patient perception and therapeutic engagement. Conclusion: Implicit ‘giving’ by therapists fosters empowerment and strengthens the therapeutic alliance, enhancing patient engagement and outcomes. The hospital environment offers a structured space for self-reflection and emotional recovery, while peer relationships promote growth. The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy stabilizes patients’ psychological states and improves receptivity to treatment. An integrated approach to these treatments is essential for optimizing patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to investigate relationships between parental-economic factors and suicidal ideation among left-behind children in underprivileged regions of China using network analysis, to pinpoint key factors and pathways contributing to suicidal ideation, thereby facilitating evidence-based suicide preventive interventions. Methods: In total, 1076 left-behind children were selected from a large dataset (N = 249,772) after applying exclusion criteria. Suicidal ideation was assessed via the Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Inventory-Chinese Version (PANSI-C). The outcomes were grouped into positive suicidal ideation and negative suicidal ideation within the network analysis framework. Sociodemographic data, parental status, and economic status were also recorded. Through network analyses, centrality and bridge indices were calculated. Network stability and accuracy were evaluated by bootstrapping methods. Results: The network had three communities: positive suicidal ideation, negative suicidal ideation, and covariates. Strong positive correlations were observed within communities, especially among “life worth”, “confident”, and “satisfy”. Nodes “failure”, “lonely and sad”, “confident”, and “satisfy” exhibited the highest expected influence. Nodes “hopeless”, “life worth”, and “satisfaction of family members’ relationships” served as bridges between the covariates and suicidal ideation. Significant structural differences existed between female and male networks. Conclusions: This study highlights the multifaceted nature of suicidal ideation among left-behind children, which is influenced by various parental-economic factors. Key node and bridge links offer targets for tailored interventions. Gender-sensitive approaches are imperative in suicide preventive measures. Network analysis provides a comprehensive framework to unravel complex relationships, informing evidence-based interventions for left-behind children.",

    "abstract": "To tailor culturally sensitive interventional strategies for safeguarding adolescents' mental health, this study investigated the role of perceived parental involvement in predicting depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents, considering family socioeconomic status (SES). A cluster convenience sampling method recruited 21,818 participants from 48 middle schools across 29 provinces in China. The perceived parental involvement (PPI) Scale and the Chinese version of the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CES-D) assessed parental involvement and depressive symptoms, respectively. Data analysis employed linear mixed-effect models (LMM) and latent profile analysis (LPA). The results indicated that 35.26% of adolescents exhibited subclinical depressive symptoms. LMM analysis revealed that higher perceived parental involvement scores, particularly emotional involvement, significantly predicted lower CES-D scores (β = -0.45, p < 0.001). LPA identified three distinct family factors profiles, with the \"High SES-High PPI\" group showing the lowest depression scores. The findings underscore the protective benefits of perceived parental involvement, especially emotional support, in mitigating depressive symptoms among adolescents. Specifically, adolescents from families with both high SES and high parental involvement exhibited the lowest levels of depressive symptoms, suggesting that interventions should focus on enhancing emotional support and addressing socioeconomic disparities to effectively reduce adolescent depression.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental and emotional disorder and is considered to be the greatest cause of non-fatal disease worldwide. Early life stress (ELS) refers to the exposure of an individual to physical and psychological stress events such as neglect or abuse in early life that has a long-term impact on brain development, thus inducing emotional and cognitive disorders in adulthood. It is the main susceptibility and risk factor for depression. Current clinical treatment is primarily based on Western medicines such as fluoxetine, but there can be serious adverse reactions. Therefore, exploring the biochemical mechanism of ELS-induced disorders and how to intervene effectively and safely to prevent and treat depression has become a significant issue. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the unique advantages of few adverse reactions and high safety and has great potential for the treatment of depression. Maternal separation (MS) is one of the most important and commonly used models for simulating ELS. Many studies have shown that MS-induced depression involves the regulation of multiple pathways and several studies have shown that TCM improves MS-induced depression. However, there is currently a lack of systematic reviews and summaries of the molecular mechanisms of MS-induced depression and traditional Chinese medical interventions. Therefore, the mechanisms of action and traditional Chinese medical interventions for MS-mediated depression were reviewed by searching recent relevant literature and discussing the limitations of current research. The aim was to provide guidance for follow-up basic research and clinical treatment.",

    "abstract": ": Suicide is a significant public health issue globally, and psychological pain (psychache) is one of the principal risk factors for suicide. It is suggested that when psychache becomes intolerable, suicide attempts are made to get rid of the pain. This study aims to investigate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Unbearable Psychache Scale, which assesses psychache quickly. In this study, we included 136 patients with depression, 45 (33.09%) of whom had previous suicide attempts, and 120 healthy controls. The participants filled out the Unbearable Psychache Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Psychache Scale, and Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale, Psychache Scale, Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale, and Unbearable Psychache Scale mean scores were significantly higher in the patients than healthy controls (P < .001 for each). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the Unbearable Psychache Scale was 0.96 in the internal consistency analysis. The item-total score values were between 0.96 and 0.97. The exploratory factor analysis demonstrated that the Unbearable Psychache Scale was loaded under 1 factor with an eigenvalue above 1 and explained 89.80% of the total variance. The factor loads were between 0.94 and 0.96. There was a significant correlation between the Unbearable Psychache Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale, Psychache Scale, and Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale (P < .001 for each). The Unbearable Psychache Scale differentiated 82% of the patients from the control group and 66.90% of the patients with suicidal attempts from those without suicide attempts. This study demonstrated that the Turkish version of the Unbearable Psychache Scale was valid and reliable and can be used in depressive patients and healthy individuals.",

The swing phase of gait was found to be longer in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-combined type (P = .01). The current study results show that gross motor skills are affected negatively and the swing phase is prolonged in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-combined type. Upper limb coordination and balance were also seen to have an effect on the velocity, step, and stride length.

    "abstract": "There remains a lack of clarity as to the possible cross talk of insight into illness and depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We therefore set our primary aim to evaluate relationship between insight dimensions and depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia receiving clozapine. This was a cross-sectional, non-interventional study, conducted in daily clinical practice conditions. Patients in outpatient clinics between March 2020 and May 2020 with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (based on Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis), with no comorbid psychiatric disorder, and with no body mass index greater than 40.0 kg/m2 were included. We collected sociodemographic variables, scores of insight dimensions (treatment compliance, illness recognition, and symptom relabeling with the Schedule for Assessment of Insight), and depressive symptoms with Calgary Depression Score for Schizophrenia. Linear regression models were used to investigate variables associated with depressive symptoms as the outcome of interest. The final analysis sample comprised 55 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with a mean age of 42.48 (SD = 9.18) years and a predominance of the male sex (n = 42, 76.9%). Model 1 [Calgary Depression Score for Schizophrenia ~ (Schedule for Assessment of Insight + Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale)] displayed that 48% of the variation in the Calgary Depression Score for Schizophrenia can be explained by Schedule for Assessment of Insight-composite and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-composite (P < .001). More effectively, model 2 [Calgary Depression Score for Schizophrenia ~ (Schedule for Assessment of Insight-illness recognition + Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-general psychopathology)] revealed that 51% of the variation in the Calgary Depression Score for Schizophrenia can be explained by the sub-scales (P < .001). We further designed a new model in which Global Assessment of Functioning scores were the response variable to explore the link between awareness into illness and functionality (Global Assessment of Functioning ~ Schedule for Assessment of Insight-illness recognition). In this model, awareness of illness did not explain a significant proportion of variance in functionality scores (R 2 = 0.045, F(1,52) = 2.48, P = 0.121). The treatment compliance part of insight was not one of the significant explanatory variables of depressive symptoms, but it explained the variance in functioning, in contrast to the illness recognition dimension of insight. If our findings were replicated in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, they would suggest that promoting treatment compliance dimension of insight instead of recognition of illness could not increase depressive symptoms.",

College students using social networking service (SNS) (n = 603, 43.6% male) filled out self-report questionnaires of covert narcissism, social media use motives, and problematic social media use. Participants who reported more covert narcissism reported more problematic social media use. In addition, the relations between covert narcissism and problematic social media use was mediated by information, enhancement, coping, and conformity motives. The findings of this study can help to establish an intervention program -suitable for a specific population group and identify high-risk groups for problematic social media use.",

    "abstract": "Background: Social support is recognized as a critical factor in both the prevention and management of Major depression Disorder (MDD), and can influence interoceptive processes. The mechanism of sex differences in the association between social support and MDD has not been clarified. This study was to elucidate the mechanism of sex differences in the association between social support and MDD by a mediation analysis with interoception mediator. Methods: Participants included 390 depressed patients (male/female: 150/240). Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) was used to assess the degree of social support; Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2C) was used to evaluate the interoception; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression status. The pairwise correlated variables were put into the mediation model for the mediation analysis. Results: The depression status in female depressed patients was more severity than that in male depressed patients, while the social support in female depressed patients was less than that in male depressed patients. In male depressed patients, the Noticing of MAIA-2C plays a partial mediating role in social support and depression status, however, in female depressed patients, the Self-Regulation and Trusting of MAIA-2C plays a partial mediating role in social support and depression status. Conclusions: The female depressed patients receive significantly less social support than male counterparts, contributing to more severe symptoms, with the quality and adequacy of social support being crucial due to its mediation by interoception, highlighting a biological mechanism behind MDD. Differences in how interoception mediating role between genders suggest a physiological reason for the heightened severity of depressive symptoms in females.",

Here, we investigated whether this pattern of mental health issues could be confirmed and replicated among individuals with amphetamine use disorder (AUD). We also assessed the degree of perceived social support from their families, friends and significant others, always compared to healthy controls (HC) of the general population. Method: Individuals with AUD attending the Outpatient Department for Substance Abuse of the Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences (Kermanshah, Iran) (n = 468; 30.8% females; mean age: 29.16 years) and healthy controls (HC; n = 376; 34.6% females; mean age: 24.11 years) participated in the study. Participants completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, symptoms of insomnia and depression, and perceived social support from their families, friends and significant others. Results: Compared to HC, individuals with AUD reported higher scores for insomnia and depression, and lower scores for perceived social support (families; friends; significant others). Older age and higher severity scores for depression and insomnia were the predictors in the binary logistic regression model to identify individuals with AUD and HC with a precision of 97.4%. Conclusions: Individuals with AUD additionally suffer from insomnia and depression, along with lower perceived social support. Given that standardized intervention programs for insomnia, depression and social competencies exist, such interventions might mitigate mental health issues among individuals with AUD and improve their psychosocial behavior.",

Although construction of animal models of ASD using chemical exposure during pregnancy is a mature technique, the gut microbiota of these exposure models induced using different chemicals in mice have not been compared. Methods: To compare the effects of exposure to different chemicals during pregnancy on the composition of gut microbiota in offspring, we treated Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy to construct different offspring ASD mouse models. After successful model construction, the gut microbiota of these models were studied. Results: After adjusting for the random effects of the litter, the two groups showed a significant reduction in social time (social deficits) and an increase in self-grooming behaviors (repetitive and stereotyped behaviors). Gut microbiota analysis revealed significant changes, mostly a decrease, in the abundance of four phyla, 52 genera, and 41 species in the two types of ASD models. Several different gut microbes could be related to the development of ASD. Conclusions: Chemicals exposure during pregnancy induces ASD-related behavioral abnormalities in offspring mice. Importantly, exposure to different chemicals during pregnancy produces varying degrees of effects on gut microbiota composition in offspring ASD models. This finding can provide a reference for studies on the etiology and pathogenesis of ASD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the risk factors for relapse among elderly schizophrenia patients undergoing maintenance phase treatment, aiming to offer insights for relapse prevention in this population. A survey was conducted of elderly schizophrenia patients in the maintenance phase who attended outpatient clinics at a specialized psychiatric hospital from October, 2021 to September, 2023. The survey included both general and clinical data. Univariate analysis and multivariate non-conditional logistic regression analysis were conducted to identify independent risk factors for relapse in elderly schizophrenic patients undergoing maintenance phase treatment. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn based on logistic regression results and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive value of each risk factor for relapse studied in these patients. A total of 247 patients were collected, with 225 patients included in the analysis: 75 in the recurrence group and 150 in the non-recurrence group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated: Irregular medication status (odds ratio (OR) = 3.302, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.386-7.871), low exercise frequency (OR = 2.770, 95% CI: 1.141-6.726), family care points (OR = 0.647, 95% CI: 0.514-0.813), life event points (OR = 1.353, 95% CI: 1.194-1.533), and sleep duration (OR = 0.630, 95% CI: 0.504-0.788) as independent influencing factors for relapse during the maintenance phase of elderly patients with schizophrenia. The AUC for predicting relapse varied among these factors: Medication status (AUC: 0.660, 95% CI: 0.594-0.726), exercise frequency (AUC: 0.663, 95% CI: 0.599-0.727), family care (AUC: 0.691, 95% CI: 0.618-0.764), life events (AUC: 0.792, 95% CI: 0.731-0.853), and sleep duration (AUC: 0.789, 95% CI: 0.718-0.859). When considering all influencing factors, the AUC for predicting relapse during maintenance phase treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia was 0.908 (95% CI: 0.867-0.949). Medication status, exercise frequency, family care, life events and sleep duration emerged as independent influencing factors for relapse among elderly schizophrenia patients during maintenance phase treatment. Paying attention to these influencing factors simultaneously is suggested to prevent recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Agitation represents a serious and prevalent symptomatology within acute schizophrenia. This study aims to conduct a nuanced comparison of the efficacy and safety profiles of intramuscular (IM) ziprasidone versus IM haloperidol in the management of agitation among patients with acute schizophrenia. This investigation was structured as a randomized, 3-day study, utilizing flexible dosing strategies. It included 69 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, who were randomly allocated to receive either IM ziprasidone (n = 35, 20 to 40 mg/day) or IM haloperidol (n = 34, 5 to 10 mg/day). The primary endpoints included comparative analyses of the change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) scores from baseline to study completion across the two groups. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the IM ziprasidone and haloperidol groups. Both treatments led to significant reductions in PANSS-EC total scores (haloperidol, p = 0.001; ziprasidone, p = 0.001) and PANSS total scores (haloperidol, p = 0.001; ziprasidone, p = 0.001) from baseline to study endpoint. Nevertheless, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of changes in PANSS-EC scores (p = 0.312) and PANSS total scores (p = 0.159) from baseline to endpoint. The haloperidol group exhibited a higher incidence of adverse events compared with the ziprasidone group, reaching statistical significance (p = 0.027). Our findings indicate that both medications are equally effective in controlling agitation symptoms. However, ziprasidone exhibited superior characteristics in safety and tolerability, particularly in reducing the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the association between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms and antidepressant response in patients with first-episode late-life depression (LLD). A total of 72 patients with first-episode LLD were recruited and 57 completed an 8-week course of antidepressant treatment. Participants were assessed at baseline and post-treatment using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Serum BDNF levels were measured via Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and BDNF gene polymorphisms were genotyped using the Agena® MassARRAY system. After 8 weeks, 17 of the 57 patients with LLD showed effective treatment response (effective group), while 40 were classified as ineffective. Significant post-treatment improvements were observed across the cohort in HAMD-17 and RBANS scores, and serum BDNF levels compared with baseline (p < 0.05). However, the effective and ineffective groups did not have significantly different RBANS scores or serum BDNF levels (p > 0.05). Binary logistic regression identified male sex (OR = 10.094, p = 0.007) and BDNF gene polymorphism (OR = 6.559, p = 0.003) as predictors of treatment efficacy. Antidepressant treatment for 8 weeks altered serum BDNF levels in patients with LLD, with male patients carrying the Val/Val genotype potentially responded better to conventional antidepressants. The small sample size may limit the generalizability of these findings. The study was registered at https://www.chictr.org.cn (registration number: ChiCTR1900024445).",

To explore the diagnostic efficacy of the Chinese version of the MoCA-B against the MMSE for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Eighty four patients with acute cerebral infarction were grouped into a post-stroke cognitive normal (PSCN) or a PSCI group based on their scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), the gold standard for diagnosing PSCI. They were evaluated by using the MMSE and MoCA-B scales, then the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used for evaluation. Most factors of the MoCA-B were significantly different between the two groups, and the PSCN group completed the MoCA-B faster (p < 0.05). The AUC analysis showed that for the MoCA-B with a cut-off total score of 23, sensitivity = 85.71%, specificity = 61.22%, Youden's J Index = 0.469, and AUC = 0.832. For the MMSE with a cut-off total score of 25, sensitivity = 70.59%, specificity = 93.75%, Youden's J Index = 0.643, and AUC = 0.885. The AUC of the MMSE was higher than that of the MoCA-B (p > 0.05). The MoCA-B had greater sensitivity and negative predictive value than the MMSE. When considering the cutoffs for identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) across different education levels, the MoCA-B had a higher positive rate for PSCI identification (51.2% vs 25%, p < 0.001), indicating that the MoCA-B is suitable for identifying PSCI. The MoCA-B demonstrates higher sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with the MMSE in the screening of post-stroke cognitive impairment patients.",

Herein we examine the link between transcriptome data and FC differences in patients with major depressive disorder with significant anxiety (MDD/ANX+) and patients with major depressive disorder without significant anxiety (MDD/ANX-). We compared the FC between the MDD/ANX+ group (n = 294) and the MDD/ANX- group (n = 218) to identify FC differences at both edge-based and network levels. Using the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed partial least squares regression analysis to identify genes associated with the observed FC disparities, followed by a functional enrichment analysis. The results from both edge-based and network-level FC analyses consistently indicated significantly increased FC between the subcortical network (SC) and visual network, as well as between the SC and dorsal attention network, in the MDD/ANX+ group compared with the MDD/ANX- group. Additionally, transcriptome-neuroimaging correlation analysis revealed that the expression of 1066 genes was spatially correlated with the FC differences between the MDD/ANX+ and MDD/ANX- groups. These genes were enriched in translation at synapses and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Our results indicate that gene expression variations in synaptic translation and ATP generation may affect FC and anxiety risk in MDD patients.",

Methods: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder who were regularly followed at our clinic between January 2023 and October 2024 and initiated on the AOM treatment following the TIS regimen. Recorded data included diagnoses, sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender), concurrent psychotropic medications at the time of AOM-TIS initiation, time of hospital discharge following AOM-TIS administration, and details regarding their last AOM treatment. Results: This study included 29 patients (17 females and 12 males; mean age 36.62 ± 12.18 years) who received AOM according to the TIS regimen. AOM was administered as monotherapy in 48.2% of cases. Three patients initiated treatment directly with the AOM-TIS regimen, while nine patients did not receive any concomitant psychotropic medication. Five patients were prescribed mood stabilizers in combination with the AOM-TIS regimen. No serious adverse events, including arrhythmias, severe hyperthermia, impaired consciousness, akathisia, or allergic reactions, were reported following AOM-TIS administration. Conclusions: The AOM-TIS regimen enables the attainment of therapeutic plasma concentrations within a shortened timeframe, facilitating a more rapid clinical response. This approach may contribute to reduced healthcare costs by shortening the duration of hospitalization and enhancing patient adherence, supported by its favorable tolerability profile.",

The aim of this study was to provide understanding of patient insight in acute bipolar mania. Methods: A total of 52 inpatients who were diagnosed with bipolar disorder during a manic episode were included in the study. The Insight Scale for Affective Disorders (ISAD) was utilized, with high scores indicating poor insight. The Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire (SAIQ) was used to assess patient attitudes and treatment experiences, with higher scores reflecting greater insight. Associated factors were identified through Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: A low ISAD score was correlated with older age (p = 0.003), an extended duration of illness (p = 0.007), presence of a medical comorbidity (p = 0.012), and low scores on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale (p &lt; 0.001), Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale (p &lt; 0.001), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (p &lt; 0.001), and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scale (p = 0.007).

The findings could provide insights into IF as a potential non-pharmacological intervention for anxiety, offering clinical significance as a cost-effective and accessible alternative or adjunct therapy. Methods: Twenty-six healthy adults followed a time-restricted eating regimen for 50 days, fasting for 18 hours daily. Assessments were conducted at baseline, during fasting (days 10, 30, and 50), and after fasting (days 20 and ~60). Measurements included body mass index (BMI), metabolic parameters, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity of the amygdala. Results: The BMI, glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance, and anxiety scores significantly decreased during and after fasting compared to the baseline measurements (all p &lt; 0.05), lasting for two months. Furthermore, we used the bilateral laterobasal amygdala as seed regions, which are responsible for emotional regulation and anxiety-like behaviours; we found changes in resting-state connectivity with the postcentral gyrus on fasting days 30 and 50. Conclusion: IF reduces anxiety by modulating amygdala functional connectivity and enhancing brain plasticity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic approach for anxiety and related emotional disorders. The findings underscore IF’s promise as an alternative or adjuvant intervention in psychiatric care.

This study aimed to measure Theory of Mind (ToM) performance and possible interactions between ToM performance, personality traits, and substance use severity. Methods: Participants (n = 153) were assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes, Dokuz Eylul Theory of Mind Index, Addiction Profile Index (API), Borderline Personality Questionnaire (BPQ), Basic Empathy Scale (BES), and Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy scale (LSRP). Results: Cluster analysis identified two groups: a ‘high ToM’ (n = 59, 41.2%) and a ‘low ToM’ (n = 84, 58.8%) group. Comparative analysis showed that the API effect of substance use on life subscale scores (p = 0.033), BES total (p = 0.003), and affective empathy subscale scores (p = 0.001) were higher in the high ToM group compared with the low ToM group. Conversely, BPQ impulsivity subscale scores (p = 0.011), LSRP total (p = 0.026), and primary psychopathy subscale scores (p = 0.007) were lower in the high ToM group compared with the low ToM groups.

Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence that in women with SUD, affective psychopathic traits and lack of affective empathy predict lower ToM abilities. These findings suggest that intervention targeting affect-related psychopathy dimensions may be effective in alleviating ToM disabilities.",

Factors were determined using eigenvalues ≥1, with factor loadings exceeding 0.4 and oblique rotations identifying factor compositions. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure, Cronbach’s alpha, Bartlett’s test, communality, non-redundant residuals, and the component correlation matrix were used to assess factor validity. Intercorrelations between the scales’ symptoms were also analyzed. Results: The mean BDI-II score was 24.31 (standard deviation (SD) = 14.93) and the mean HAMD-21 score was 17.38 (SD = 8.91). According to the cutoff criteria for both scales, the sample exhibited moderate depression. The BDI-II identified three factors, while the HAMD-21 revealed four distinct factors. Combined analysis showed that most BDI-II items and core depressive symptoms from HAMD-21 clustered into Component I. Component II included four HAMD-21 items: insomnia (delayed), agitation, somatic anxiety, and insight. Significant positive correlations between paired BDI-II and HAMD-21 symptoms were found, with a high correlation (r = 0.88, p = 0.000) between the scales, differing from previous findings. Conclusion: The high correlations within components, along with low non-redundant residuals and high communality, indicate satisfactory factor validity for both the BDI-II and HAMD-21. The self-report BDI-II inventory and the HAMD-21 scale are complementary in evaluating depressive symptoms in patients with IBS.",

This review aims to consolidate current understanding and recent advances in the neuroanatomical and pathophysiological basis of PD. Method: A narrative review was conducted, drawing on recent literature addressing the neurobiology and neuroanatomy of PD, with a particular focus on fear circuits as elucidated by both preclinical and clinical studies. Results: This updated review further delineates the fear circuitry implicated in PD, emphasizing the roles of the amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, insula, and prefrontal cortex in the mediation of pathological fear responses. Conclusion: Continued research involving human populations is essential to refine current models of fear circuitry in PD. Such efforts may yield critical insights that support the development of evidence-based therapeutic strategies aimed at re-establishing disrupted homeostatic processes that have been disrupted by the activation of the brain’s fear circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To explore trajectory and sex differences of varied cognitive dimensions over time in the normal aging elderly. Methods: The cluster sampling method was used to select a representative community (n = 341). Individuals aged 60 years and above with normal cognitive function were identified (n = 281). One-to-one neuropsychological tests were conducted at baseline and repeated 1 and 5 years later. A mixed linear model was developed to analyze the changes and sex discrepancies in different cognitive dimensions of the elderly based on the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and World Health Organization Battery of Cognitive Assessment Instruments for the elderly (WHO-BCAI). Results: When comparing the 1-year follow-up with baseline data, the scores of auditory vocabulary in both men and women had significantly increased (t = –2.52, t = –4.8, p &lt; 0.05), while the Wechsler mapping in women had significantly increased (t = –2.62, p &lt; 0.05). When comparing the 5-year follow-up with baseline data, MMSE (t = 6.38, t = 6.06, p &lt; 0.05) and MoCA (t = 7.34, t = 7.03, p &lt; 0.05) scores had significantly decreased in both groups, the digit span scores had significantly decreased in men (t = 2.67, p &lt; 0.05), and the scores of auditory vocabulary in women had significantly increased (t = –2.54, p &lt; 0.05). When comparing the 5-year follow-up with the 1-year follow-up data, the digit span scores in women had significantly decreased (t = 2.88, p &lt; 0.05), and the Wechsler mapping scores in both groups had significantly decreased (t = 3.68, t = 3.14, p &lt; 0.05). A sex discrepancy emerged in several tests of specific cognitive domains after adjusting for education. At baseline, women outperformed men in auditory vocabulary, associative learning, and delayed recall while men outperformed women in Wechsler mapping. Importantly, auditory vocabulary and Wechsler mapping were better in women and men, respectively, at all visit times. The superiority of associative learning and delayed recall of women shrunk with advancing age. Conclusions: Sex differences in cognitive variation indicated a steeper decline for women in verbal episodic memory, associative memory, and short-term memory. Meanwhile, a sharper deterioration in memory, comprehension and recognition of spatial relationships, and visual structure ability was observed in men. The sex differences in different cognitive dimensions diminished over time.",

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by reduced social motivation and often co-occurs with epilepsy, representing a distinct clinical subgroup. This study investigated social deficits in Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats, which present with latent epilepsy and an autistic-like phenotype, by measuring ultrasonic communications during social interaction. Methods: The three-chamber test for social preference/novelty, accompanied by registration of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), was conducted in 12 KM and 12 control Wistar rats. For analysis, each individual vocalization trajectory was mapped and the results were derived from aggregating the individual data. To assess potential anhedonia, sucrose preference was tested in a separate group (10 KM and 20 Wistar rats) by measuring the consumption of 1% sucrose and water in individual rats over a 24-h period. All animals used were seizure-naive males, aged 4–6 months. Results: A longer duration of aversive USV calls was registered during the sociability tests in KM rats (p &lt; 0.05, compared with controls). The majority (p &lt; 0.05) of aversive USVs occurred when KM rats distanced themselves from the social stimuli, and the duration of these calls showed a positive correlation with freezing behavior (Spearman coefficient Rs = 0.68, p &lt; 0.05). Reduced sucrose preference was not observed in KM rats; instead, an increase in daytime sucrose consumption was noted. Conclusions: KM rats exhibit negative emotional states in sociability tests, as evidenced by enhanced aversive vocalizations and distancing behavior. The social aversion observed in KM rats is not associated with anhedonia.",

This study aimed to explore the relationship between illness perception, psychological flexibility, and fear of recurrence, as well as to investigate the demographic factors associated with fear of recurrence in MI patients. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, enrolling 466 MI patients to complete questionnaires assessing general information, disease-related factors, illness perception, psychological flexibility, and fear of recurrence. Correlation analysis, analysis of variance, and mediation effect analysis were used to explore the relationships between these factors and fear of recurrence. Results: Gender, monthly income, marital status, alcohol consumption, New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA classification), and number of chronic diseases were significantly associated with fear of recurrence. Illness perception was positively correlated with patients’ fear of recurrence. Psychological flexibility was negatively correlated with fear of recurrence and played a mediating role between illness perception and fear of recurrence, mediating the negative impact of illness perception on fear. Conclusion: The findings of this study emphasize the critical role of psychological flexibility in mitigating the fear of recurrence among myocardial infarction survivors. By targeting modifiable factors such as psychological flexibility and illness perceptions, healthcare providers can develop more effective interventions aimed at improving mental health and overall quality of life for these patients.",

A possible reduction of UA levels in early phases of SCZ, namely first-episode psychosis (FEP), has been hypothesized. In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze and summarize current evidence regarding UA levels in patients with early psychosis. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of case-control studies comparing serum or plasma UA levels in individuals experiencing FEP with those in healthy controls (HC). Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample of 950 individuals that included 520 FEP patients and 430 HC. A tendency for lower UA levels in FEP was described, albeit without definitive evidence, and decreased UA levels were restricted to certain ethnic populations. Conclusions: Our findings do not fully support the hypothesis of an oxidative stress response in early psychosis translatable with reduced UA levels in patients with FEP. Further research is warranted to elucidate the nature and magnitude of the relationship between oxidative stress, UA levels, and early psychosis.",

Understanding how academic distress interacts with interpersonal communication tendencies to influence depression can inform mental health interventions. This study aims to explore the direct effect of academic distress on depression and the mediating role of interpersonal communication tendency. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 7317 students in medicine and related fields at Xuzhou Medical University from September to December 2022, using stratified random cluster sampling. Data were collected using validated scales measuring academic distress, interpersonal communication tendency, and depressive symptoms. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the total, direct, and indirect effects of academic distress on depression, and a multi-group analysis was conducted to examine gender differences. Results: Academic distress was found to directly and positively affect depression (β = 0.622, 95% CI: 0.556, 0.686). Additionally, interpersonal communication tendency significantly mediated the relationship between academic distress and depression (β = –0.253, 95% CI: –0.294, –0.217). Gender-based analysis indicated a slightly stronger direct effect of academic distress on depression among male students (β = 0.630) compared to female students (β = 0.606). Conclusions: Academic distress is strongly associated with depression among medical students, with interpersonal communication tendency serving as an effective mediator that reduces depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the need for academic institutions to support medical students by enhancing interpersonal communication skills and providing mental health resources to alleviate academic distress.",

Through an in-depth analysis of seminal texts in Arabic medical literature, including works by renowned scholars such as Tabari, Razi, Avicenna, and others, this paper elucidates the historical development of psychiatric taxonomy in the Arabic medical tradition. By examining the representations of “junun” (“madness”) or psychoses in these texts and comparing them with earlier European and current classifications, we aim to highlight the unique contributions of Arabic-scribing scholars to the field of clinical psychiatry. The Arabic taxonomy divides “junun” (“insanity”) into three major categories of (1) permanent insanities (“al-junun al-thābet”), (2) symptomatic illnesses (“a’rāz tābea-tul amrāz”), and (3) reactive. Arabic medical schools consider “insanity” as a primary brain pathology albeit with multifactorial etiology—a concept formulated by early Greco-Roman medicine, developed by Muslim physicians, and re-invented by Griesinger in the 19th century—known as the “organic model” of mental illnesses.",

    "abstract": "Background: Psychological abuse and neglect are considered fundamental to the development of impulsiveness. However, the interplay between psychological abuse-neglect symptoms and impulsiveness dimensions remains unclear, especially during adolescence, a critical developmental stage. This study uses network analysis to explore the link between adolescent psychological abuse-neglect and impulsivity, aiming to inform targeted early interventions and treatment strategies for impulsive behaviors. Methods: Cluster sampling was used to gather demographic data from 6731 students across 17 middle schools. Clinical assessments utilized the Chinese Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and Child Psychological Abuse and Neglect Scale (CPANS). Network analysis explored associations between the six CPANS components and three impulsiveness dimensions. Centrality indices and stability indicators were calculated. Results: In the study population, 47.4% were female, and 68.4% were middle school students. Scolding (4.0 [1.0, 7.0]) scored highest in abuse, while Emotional Neglect (6.0 [2.0, 12.0]) scored highest in neglect. Among impulsive types, Non-planning Impulsiveness (47.5 [32.5, 60.0]) ranked highest. Emotional Neglect emerged as the central node in the network, with the greatest strength, closeness, and influence, while Non-planning Impulsiveness showed the highest correlation with centrality. All centrality indices had Correlation Stability (CS) coefficients of 0.75, with narrow 95% confidence intervals for edge weights. Conclusions: This study underscores the central role of emotional neglect in the development of impulsive traits in adolescents. Network analysis revealed that emotional neglect serves as a critical link between abuse-neglect and impulsivity, with non-planning impulsivity acting as a key mediator. The results emphasize the need for comprehensive interventions, as well as addressing the impact of early traumatic experiences.

Although previous studies have extensively explored functional connectivity associated with CM, the dynamic interaction of brain effective connectivity (EC) is not well documented. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 215 adults with an assessment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Whole-brain EC was estimated by regression dynamic causal modeling and subsequently down-resampled into seven networks. To predict CTQ total scores, repeated cross-validated ridge-regularized linear regression was employed, with whole-brain and network-specific EC features selected at thresholds of 5% of the strongest positive and negative correlations between EC and scores, as well as 10% and 20% thresholds. Additionally, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-regularized linear regression model was utilized as validation analysis. Results: Our findings revealed that whole-brain EC showed a marginal association with predicting CTQ total scores, and EC within the default mode network (DMN) significantly predicted these scores. EC features from other networks did not yield significant predictive results. Notably, across varying feature selection thresholds, DMN features consistently demonstrated significant predictive power, comparable to results from LASSO-regularized predictions. Conclusions: These findings suggested that brain EC can capture individual differences in CM severity, with the DMN potentially serving as an important predictor related to CM.",

Traditional epidemiological studies suggest that cannabis use has an effect on some neurocognitive aspects. However, it is unclear whether cannabis use is causally related to common neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study was conducted to illustrate the causal relationships of genetically predicted cannabis use with common neuropsychiatric disorders. We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization method using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics obtained from publicly available databases on lifetime cannabis use and 10 neuropsychiatric disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, focal epilepsy, migraine, migraine with aura, migraine without aura, schizophrenia (SCZ), anorexia nervosa (AN), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied with a two-sample Mendelian randomization method for GWAS summary statistics. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main analysis model. Our study suggests that lifetime cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of developing PD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.782; 95% CI 1.032-3.075; p = 0.038) and an increased risk of ADHD in female participants (OR = 1.650; 95% CI 1.051-2.590; p = 0.029). Cannabis intake may cause adverse effects relating to certain neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the side effects of addictive drugs during clinical treatment to avoid harmful effects on the brain and neurocognition.",

The strength of this association varies depending on the type of abuse, with emotional abuse showing a particularly strong connection to depression. In addition, this narrative review examines the role of personality in the relationship between childhood abuse and depression. Evidence indicates that personality traits act as both mediators and moderators in this association, with neuroticism being particularly influential. Although available research evidence primarily consists of cross-sectional studies, which cannot determine the temporal sequence of childhood abuse, personality problems, and depression, the interrelations of these three variables provide a more comprehensive understanding of the etiology of depression. These insights lay the foundation for future longitudinal research and inform the development of more targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions in clinical psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Whether changes in Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8) scores adequately reflect subjective improvement in patients with somatic symptoms and related disorders (SSRD) at follow-up is unclear. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is a criterion of estimating clinically significant improvement derived from patients' responses to anchor questions that accurately reflect changes in their condition. This study aimed to clarify the MCID value of the SSS-8 for SSRD. Patients with SSRD aged 18 to 84 years who attended a university hospital outpatient department in Japan were eligible. The participants were assessed using the SSS-8 for physical symptoms. After approximately 6 months of outpatient treatment, the participants were reassessed using the SSS-8 for physical symptoms. The primary endpoint was the Patient Global Impression of Change score. The secondary endpoint was the physical function items of the Multidimensional Patient Impression of Change questionnaire. These questionnaires were used to define improvements in subjective symptoms as the anchor to estimate the MCID. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed based on the anchor questions and the MCID values of the SSS-8 were calculated. Ninety participants were included. The primary endpoint MCID value for the SSS-8 was -6 points, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, 65.9% sensitivity, and 93.5% specificity. The secondary endpoint MCID value for the SSS-8 was -6 points, with an AUC of 0.85, 76.5% sensitivity, and 89.3% specificity. The SSS-8 is a useful indicator for SSRD clinical outcomes. Patients with SSRD may need an SSS-8 score decrease of 6 or more points to notice symptom improvements.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the relationship between attitudes toward love, attachment styles, and personality traits in women who have experienced domestic violence (DV). The study consisted of 64 women who experienced DV and 64 women without such history. All participants completed a sociodemographic data form and three assessment scales. Among women who were exposed to violence, attitudes toward altruistic and passionate love were significantly higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.026). In contrast, women who had not experienced violence showed higher levels of friendly and possessive love attitudes (p = 0.010, p < 0.001). Women who experienced violence also exhibited a significant increase in both anxious and avoidant attachment styles (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), while the emotionally balanced personality trait was significantly lower (p = 0.006). Additionally, positive correlations were found between altruistic love and anxious attachment style and between logical love and anxious attachment style (p = 0.021, r = 0.288; p = 0.033, r = 0.267, respectively). Conversely, negative correlations were observed between altruistic love attitudes and both extraversion and emotional stability (p = 0.038, r = -0.261; p = 0.030, r = -0.271, respectively), between game-playing love attitude and conscientiousness and emotional stability (p = 0.046, r = -0.250; p = 0.027, r = -0.277, respectively), and between passionate love attitude and emotional stability (p = 0.009, r = -0.323). Furthermore, a positive correlation was noted between friendly love attitudes and agreeableness (p = 0.017, r = 0.296). Individuals with high levels of emotional stability, along with friendly and possessive love attitudes, may be better equipped to cope with violence, while those with anxious and avoidant attachment styles, as well as altruistic and passionate love attitudes, may have difficulty handling such experiences.",

    "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, residual mood symptoms often persist even during the euthymic period, impairing functionality in 30-60% of patients in clinical remission. Addressing residual symptoms is critical as they are linked to reduced functionality and subjective wellbeing. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the relationship between mindful attention awareness (MASS) and residual symptom severity in bipolar I disorder. This study included 100 patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) in remission, recruited consecutively from outpatient clinics between December, 2019 and March, 2020. The patients were evaluated using the sociodemographic data form, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). As the MAAS of the patients increases, their depressive symptoms decrease (p < 0.001). As the MAAS of the patients increases, their anxiety symptoms decrease (p < 0.001). No statistically significant relationship was found between the mindful attention awareness of the patients and their manic symptoms (p = 0.161). Two variables (HAM-D and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale Scores (HAM-A)) in the multiple linear regression model explain 21.8% of the change in MAAS score. Residual depressive and anxiety symptoms are predictive of lower MAAS in bipolar I disorder. Incorporating strategies to manage residual mood symptoms and improve mindfulness may enhance functionality and facilitate complete remission. However, given the cross-sectional design and the lack of a control group, causal inferences cannot be made. Further longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to explore the efficacy of mindfulness-based approaches in BD-I and determine whether the observed associations are specific to this disorder.",

    "abstract": "The negative impact of obesity on cognitive function (CF) is well-established; nevertheless, no prior studies have explored the link between conicity index and cognitive performance. This research sought to investigate the link between conicity index and cognitive impairment. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2014 (NHANES), with CF evaluated by the total scores of three cognitive tests (TCT), the delayed recall test (DRT), the immediate recall test (IRT), the animal fluency test (AFT), and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). The conicity index was derived from waist circumference, height, and weight. Multiple linear regression, smooth curve fitting, and subgroup interaction analyses were utilized to explore the correlation between conicity index and cognitive performance. The study included 2752 subjects and the results indicated that increasing conicity index was markedly associated with declining CF. In fully adjusted models, the conicity index was linked to reductions in total cognitive score (β = -16.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): -26.68 to -6.02, p = 0.0019) and DRT (β = -1.52, 95% CI: -2.74 to -0.30, p = 0.0151), IRT (β = -2.93, 95% CI: -5.37 to -0.48, p = 0.0190), AFT (β = -2.03, 95% CI: -4.88 to 0.82, p = 0.1636), and DSST (β = -9.88, 95% CI: -17.11 to -2.65, p = 0.0075) scores. However, the negative association between conicity index and AFT score was not statistically significant. Lower CF is associated with a higher conicity index. The conicity index is useful for the early detection of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we report on the initial development, progress, and future plans for an autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to manage major depressive disorder (MDD). The system is a web-based, patient-facing conversational AI that collects medical history, provides presumed diagnosis, recommends treatment, and coordinates care for patients with MDD. The system includes seven components, five of which are complete and two are in development. The first component is the AI's knowledgebase, which was constructed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression to analyze extensive patient medical histories and identify factors influencing response to antidepressants. The second component is a series of adjustments to the knowledgebase designed to correct algorithm bias in patient subgroups. The third component is a conversational Large Language Model (LLM) that efficiently gathers patients' medical histories. The fourth component is a dialogue management system that minimizes digressions in the LLM conversations, using a topic network statistically derived from the AI's own knowledgebase. The fifth component is planned to enable real-time, human-in-the-loop monitoring. The sixth component is an existing analytical, non-generative module that provides and explains treatment advice. The seventh component is planned to coordinate care with clinicians via closed-loop referrals. In component 1, the AI's knowledgebase correctly predicted 69.2% to 78.5% of the variation in response to 15 oral antidepressants. Patients treated by AI-concordant clinicians were 17.5% more likely to benefit from their treatment than patients of AI-discordant clinicians. In component 2, the use of the system required adjustments to improve accuracy for predicting the responses of African Americans to four antidepressants and no adjustments were required for the remaining 10 antidepressants. In component 3, the conversational intake efficiently covered 1499 relevant medical history events (including 700 diagnoses, 550 medications, 151 procedures, and 98 prior antidepressant responses). In the fourth component, the dialogue management system was effective in maintaining a long dialogue with many turns in the conversation. In the sixth component, the advice system was able to rely exclusively on pre-set text. An online ad campaign attracted 1536 residents of Virginia to use the advice system. Initially, a focus group of clinicians was skeptical of the value of the advice system and requested more prospective studies before they would implement the system in their clinics. When the system was redesigned to advise patients at home, clinicians were willing to receive referrals from the system and discuss the advice of the system with their patients. Further research is needed to refine and evaluate the system. We outline our plans for a prospective randomized trial to assess the system's impact on prescription patterns and patient outcomes.",

We previously demonstrated that behavioral patterns induced by prior psychological stress predict coping levels in response to future stressors. This study investigated whether activating corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and corticosteroid receptors mediates psychological stress-induced coping behavior. Behavioral responses in mice exhibiting a fear response elicited by exposure to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic component of fox feces, as preceding psychological stress, were assessed by measuring central zone entries in an open-field test. Time spent immobile during the tail suspension test was evaluated as a subsequent aversive stress-coping level. CRH overexpression was induced by adeno-associated virus injection (Hypo-CRH-OE) into the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. Dexamethasone (10 μg/kg, s.c.), a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, or fludrocortisone (5 mg/kg, s.c.), a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist was administered 30 min before behavioral tests. Hypo-CRH-OE mice exhibited significantly higher plasma corticosterone levels than controls, without changes in baseline of locomotor activity or innate fear sensitivity. During TMT exposure, Hypo-CRH-OE mice showed lower central activity in the open-field test, accompanied by longer immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST), disrupting the correlation between these behaviors. A similar disruptive effect was observed in fludrocortisone-treated mice but not in dexamethasone-treated mice. Additionally, fludrocortisone, but not dexamethasone, prolonged immobility during the TST. Preceding psychological stress-induced behavioral patterns may predict coping levels through mineralocorticoid receptor activations offering a potential target for improving stress resilience and preventing depression.",

This study examined self-reported personality functioning among patients with SUD compared to the general population, gender specifics, and the psychometric properties of the Czech Level of Personality Functioning Scale-Self Report (LPFS-SR). Two samples were used in this study. Sample 1 (n = 368) consisted of patients with SUD, while Sample 2 (n = 497) comprised volunteers from the general population. All participants, with an age range of 18-75 years, completed a battery of self-assessment tools, including a demographic form, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5), and the LPFS-SR, administered via a pencil-and-paper method. Internal consistency and several aspects of the validity of the Czech LPFS-SR were examined. The LPFS-SR showed high internal consistency as estimated by Cronbach's alpha (α ≥ 0.66) and the high mutual correlation with the PID-5 varied from 0.21 to 0.77. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the four LPFS-SR subscales indicated a single-component structure, accounting for 78.21% of the variance in Sample 1 and 79.20% in Sample 2, supporting previous results regarding the LPFS-SR factorial structure. Furthermore, gender-specific cut-off scores were obtained and are discussed in relation to previous research. The findings indicate that the Czech LPFS-SR is a valid and reliable tool with acceptable discriminating capacity. It can be used in research and clinical assessments of personality functioning in patients with SUD, particularly when considering gender-specific characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Children's mental health is significantly influenced by family environments, where multiple risks often coexist, exert unequal impacts, and combine in different configurations that can result in diverse developmental outcomes. This study examines how different configurations of cumulative family risks influence mental health symptoms in Chinese children using a novel person-centered approach. Data were collected through a large-scale, semester-based comprehensive survey of 34,041 children in Grades 4 to 6 in an economically underdeveloped county-level city in Guangdong, China, during November and December, 2022. Six family risk indicators were examined: incomplete family structure, parent-child separation, financial hardship, low parental education, lack of family intimacy, and family conflict. The Pediatric Symptom Checklist was used to measure children's mental health outcomes, consisting of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and attention problems. Crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis was applied to identify specific configurations of family risks associated with different mental health outcomes. No single risk factor was found necessary or sufficient to explain mental health outcomes; configurations of multiple risks were more predictive. Externalizing and attention symptoms shared one configuration, which also contributed to internalizing symptoms. Additionally, three distinct configurations were uniquely associated with internalizing symptoms. Only lack of family intimacy and family conflict consistently appeared as detrimental across all configurations. This study reinforces the cumulative risk model and aligns with the concepts of multifinality and equifinality. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring children with coexisting risks and targeted interventions addressing one or two key factors rather than all factors simultaneously. Future research should adopt longitudinal designs and include broader factors.",

Previous studies on aggression prediction have primarily focused on hospitalized patients, overlooking specific rural community contexts in China. This study investigated multidimensional predictive factors to develop and validate a predictive model for predicting physical aggression in schizophrenia patients in rural communities in southwestern China. We used convenience sampling to select 889 confirmed patients with schizophrenia from 22 rural townships recorded by the Pengzhou Mental Health Center from September to November, 2019 for baseline survey. Sixty-two candidate factors were investigated using the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and Medication Coherence Rating Scale, and aggression was evaluated using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale during a 3-month follow-up. Logistic regression was used to construct a risk prediction model and the model was validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Two variable selection methods, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate logistic regression, yielded two models: Model 1 with 27 variables and Model 2 with six variables. Both models demonstrated perfect discrimination, good calibration, and clinical utility. Model 2, with three historical and three modifiable factors, demonstrated greater utility for communities, which included physical aggression against others prior to the first episode of schizophrenia, the Modified Overt Aggression Scale score at first episode onset, mental fatigue, body mass index, experiences of discrimination, and aggression against objects before the first episode. Most predictors were non-specific to schizophrenia. These findings may help to alleviate the social discrimination and constraints faced by individuals with schizophrenia in rural communities, facilitating the provision of proactive mental health services. Furthermore, our results highlight body mass index, discrimination experiences, and mental fatigue as critical areas for rural community mental health nursing professionals.

By analyzing the key depressive symptoms related to QoL in this vulnerable population, the study aimed to identify potential critical treatment targets. In this study, the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-brief version were used to measure depressive symptoms and QoL respectively.

A total of 1683 participants were included in the analysis. Economic status was the only identified risk factor for depression in older adults with cataracts. The most central symptoms in the depression network were \"Feeling blue\", \"Everything was an effort\", and \"Inability to get going\". The flow network indicated that QoL had the strongest direct connections with \"Unhappiness\", \"Sleep disturbances\" and \"Feeling blue\". Depression was found to be common among older adults with cataracts. To mitigate the negative impact of depression on QoL, psychosocial interventions targeting the most central symptoms and those directly related to QoL should be prioritized.",

In the fall of 2023, 665 valid participants' responses were selected in this cross-sectional study. The PTSD Checklist (PCL-C), FOMO Scale, Rumination Scale (RRS), and Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS2) were used to measure participants' internet usage and mental state. Description analysis and structural equation model analysis were examined by using SmartPLS. PTSD positively influenced FOMO (β = 0.315, p < 0.001), rumination (β = 0.279, p = 0.001), and PIU (β = 0.213, p < 0.001). FOMO (β = 0.08, 95% CI (confidence interval) [0.037, 0.144], p = 0.005) and rumination (β = 0.093, 95% CI [0.032, 0.139], p = 0.002) played a mediating role in the influence of PTSD on PIU. Regarding the relationship between PTSD and PIU, direct and indirect effects comprised 45.6% and 54.4%. PTSD had a positively significant effect on PIU by mediating FOMO and rumination to form a chain mediation model (β = 0.081, 95% CI [0.010, 0.039], p = 0.002). This study investigated online usage and media psychology among survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake in China. FOMO and rumination were found to be important factors influencing the relationship between PTSD and PIU. To prevent or relieve people's PIU, we propose that medical practitioners and local government intervene on FOMO through effective measures to decrease rumination. The individual differences and specific internet platform usage that influence these psychological variables should also be further investigated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common, chronic, severe mental disorder that is often accompanied by dyslipidemia and linked to decreased life expectancy. The prevalence of dyslipidemia among initial-treatment and drug-naïve (ITDN) patients with SCZ and the correlates influencing its occurrence and severity were determined in this study. Demographic and clinical data including blood pressure, blood cell count, renal function, lipid profile, fasting glucose level, and thyroid function were collected from the 668 patients with ITDN SCZ included in this study. Psychopathology and illness severity were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity of Illness, respectively. The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 33.53% (224/668) and the influencing factors included higher education attainment (B = 0.43, p = 0.018, odds ratio [OR] = 1.54) and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) (B = 0.04, p < 0.001, OR = 1.04), which were predictive factors. Conversely, having a spouse (B = -0.40, p = 0.026, OR = 0.67), higher red blood cell counts (B = -0.77, p < 0.001, OR = 0.47), and higher free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) levels (B = -0.06, p = 0.022, OR = 0.94) were protective factors. Specifically, elevated SBP (B = 0.01, t = 2.71, p = 0.007, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.00-0.01) predicted dyslipidemia severity, whereas higher FT4 levels (B = -0.02, t = -2.45, p = 0.015, 95% CI = -0.04-0.00) had a protective effect. Our study provides valuable insights into the clinical characteristics of dyslipidemia in ITDN SCZ patients. The identified factors influencing dyslipidemia occurrence and severity could serve as potential bioindicators for its prevention and intervention in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the correlation between interleukin-5 (IL-5), eosinophils (EOS), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels with schizophrenia, and assess their potential as auxiliary diagnostic markers for schizophrenia. This study comprised 57 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 340 patients with recurrent or chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized at Beijing Huilongguan Hospital from March 2023 to August 2024, and 72 healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. Fasting venous blood samples were collected from all participants on the second day after admission. For patients with first-episode schizophrenia, a second blood draw was performed after two months of treatment. Simultaneously, the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was administered to assess the subjects. IL-5 and EOS levels were measured using flow cytometry; IgA levels were measured using immunoturbidimetry. SPSS v.29.0 was used to conduct t-tests, one-way ANOVA, correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The first-episode schizophrenia group and the recurrent/chronic schizophrenia group had elevated IL-5 levels relative to healthy controls; however, the increase in EOS levels was specifically observed in the recurrent/chronic schizophrenia group. After treatment, the IL-5 level in the first-episode group was markedly reduced. Correlation analysis revealed that in patients with schizophrenia, IL-5 levels were positively correlated with EOS (r = 0.338, p < 0.001), and EOS levels were positively associated with disease duration (r = 0.171, p < 0.05), the ROC curve analysis revealed that IL-5 had a sensitivity of 52.9%, specificity of 69.4%, and a cut-off value of 2.445 pg/mL for predicting schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, the elevated levels of IL-5 and EOS appear to be disease-related rather than medication-induced, suggesting their potential involvement in the inflammatory pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, IL-5 exhibits greater predictive accuracy for schizophrenia compared to EOS, suggesting that IL-5 may serve as a valuable biomarker for auxiliary diagnosis and stratification analysis in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Background: Postictal delirium (PID) is a significant and often underrecognized adverse effect associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in geriatric patients. Despite its clinical relevance, the specific risk factors contributing to the development of PID in this vulnerable population remain inadequately understood, which may affect treatment outcomes and patient safety. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 168 elderly patients who underwent ECT between 2009 and 2020 at a general hospital in China. Univariate analyses of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were performed to identify variables for inclusion in a logistic regression model. Multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between these variables and PID occurrence. Results: The incidence of PID was 20.8% (35/168) among the study cohort. Univariate analysis revealed statistically significant differences between PID and non-PID groups for lithium (χ2 = 6.67, p = 0.010), quetiapine (χ2 = 4.36, p = 0.037), number of ECT sessions (U = 3065.50, p = 0.003), and response rate (χ2 = 12.86, p &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that lithium (odds ratio (OR) = 5.128; p = 0.009) and quetiapine (OR = 2.562; p = 0.024) were significantly associated with PID. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that lithium and quetiapine use significantly increase the risk of developing PID, underscoring the need for clinical vigilance. Careful consideration of these medications when planning ECT treatment is recommended to minimize the risk of postictal complications and optimize therapeutic outcomes.",

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may cause oxidative stress by the electrical field or by the induced seizure. It was aimed to review the literature in terms of the influence of ECT on levels of oxidant and antioxidant compounds. The literature search was performed with the keywords that were oxidative stress or \"DNA damage\" or \"RNA damage\" or \"lipid peroxidase\" or \"superoxide dismutase\" or \"catalase\" or \"glutathione\" or \"nitrite\" or \"nitric oxide\" and \"electroconvulsive therapy\" or \"electroconvulsive shock\" or \"electroconvulsive seizure\". Twenty of 1480 records were included. Eleven studies were performed in human subjects, whereas 9 studies were performed in rats. Human studies are conducted with serum, plasma, or urine samples; rat studies include brain tissues from various sites. In rats, four independent studies showed increased levels of lipid oxidation markers, and four independent studies reported increased levels of oxidative stress markers in brain samples. In human studies, studies were performed with circulating blood samples and the results were more inconsistent. Although some markers like superoxide dismutase or thioredoxin imply that ECT may increase the balance for oxidative stress, this notion is not supported by other markers of ECT. The current literature does not clearly suggest that the ECT is associated with oxidative stress in psychiatric disorders. Further studies with similar methods should be performed in big samples.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia patients often have personality disorders; schizophrenia patients with personality disorders are more difficult to treat and have a worse prognosis. Early identification of this group of patients and early intervention can achieve better prognosis. Therefore, it is very important to explore effective biomarkers and early diagnosis for the prognosis of schizophrenia. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between plasma miRNA expression level and personality disorder with schizophrenia. Gene microarrays in miRNA files were employed, and the plasma of peripheral blood of 82 schizophrenic patients and 43 healthy control subjects were examined. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detection were performed to explore the results. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between expression level of miRNAs and Personality Diagnosis Questionnaire-4 score. The results showed that miR-1273d, miR-1303, miR-3064-5p, miR-3131, miR-3687, miR-4428, miR-4725-3p, and miR-5096 were up-regulated in schizophrenic patients. Compared to healthy control subjects, the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). Schizophrenic patients with schizoid, paranoid, schizotypal, and obsessive compulsive traits had negative correlation with miR-1303, miR-3131, miR-4428, and miR-5096 expression level (r = -0.40 to -0.62, P < .05); there were no significant differences in the other miRNAs. Correlation with other personality traits was not significant (P > .05). The stepwise regression analysis indicated that miR-5096, miR-3131, and miR-1273d have a significant predictive effect on the schizoid trait (P < .01). MiR-4428 and miR-1303 had a significant predictive effect on the schizotypal trait (P < .01). MiR-5096, miR-4428, and miR-4725-3P had a significant predictive effect on the paranoid trait (P < .05). MiR-4428, miR-1303, and miR-5096 had a significant predictive effect on the obsessive compulsive trait (P < .05).

    "abstract": "University students were significantly affected by the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, with significant impacts on their mental health, resilience skills, and life skills. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate these parameters by focusing on the experiences of 472 university students as well as examining correlations between mental states, resilience, and life skills. The secondary aim was to conduct a pilot study of a 10-week psychoeducation program that uses positive psychotherapy to improve resilience skills. The first phase of this research project was designed as a quantitative and correlative study, while the second phase was designed as a quasi-experimental model. Data collection tools used in the first phase included the Sociodemographic Information Form, Life Skills Scale (LSS), Symptom Checklist (SCL90R), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) was used in the second phase. The sample group for the first phase was 472 university students from several university institutes in Cyprus, while the quasi-experimental group consisted of 33 psychology students from the University of Cyprus. The average mental symptoms score for students based on SCL90R was 1.10 ± 0.70, showing they have psychological symptoms and grievances. Significant negative correlations were found between the BRS general score and the LSS general and SCL90R scores (all P = .001). The model was found to be significant and could explain 18.5% of the effect according to the predictive status of LSS and SCL90R scores in BRS scores. In conclusion, this study provides vital insights into the mental well-being of university students during the pandemic. The findings reveal a concerning prevalence of psychological symptoms and distress among students, indicating a significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their mental health. This research also demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted interventions. The positive changes in resilience skills and reduced mental health symptoms observed after the 10-week study period highlight the importance of proactive approaches. This study underscores the urgent need for accessible mental health resources and tailored support mechanisms for university students, especially during times of crisis. Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering a resilient and mentally healthy student population.",

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Stmn1 gene (rs182455 and rs213641) significantly impacted individual fear and anxiety responses in German. However, there have been no reports on the correlation between Stmn1 SNPs and anxiety in Chinese. The present study thus aimed to explore such correlation. A sample of 567 healthy Han Chinese adults were genotyped for the Stmn1 SNP, namely rs182455, using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Anxiety was assessed by the Chinese version of 40-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which measures 2 anxiety dimensions, state and trait anxiety. The numbers of CC, CT, and TT genotypes of rs182455 polymorphism were 227 (40.0%), 263 (46.4%), and 77 (13.6%), respectively. The genotype distribution did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ 2 = 0.004, P = .953). There were no significant differences in either state or trait anxiety among the 3 rs182455 genotype groups (F = 0.457, 0.415, P = .634, .660), between the 2 dominant model groups (t = 0.865, -0.195, P = .388, .845), or between the 2 recessive model groups (t = 0.106, 0.906, P = .916, .365). Moreover, no significant gender-specific differences in any STAI scores were found among the rs182455 genotype groups (all P > .05).

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested a link between hypertension and psychiatric disorders. However, the relationship between hypertension and mental health conditions remains unclear. So in this study, it was aimed to compare the prevalence of psychiatric diseases seen in hypertension patients with the healthy group. Psychiatric interviews were conducted with 104 patients in the hypertension group and 102 participants in the control group. The Sociodemographic and Clinical Data Form, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Disorders, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5-Clinician Version, and DSM-5 Structured Clinical Interview for Personality Disorders were implemented for participants. Patients with hypertension were found to have a significantly higher number of psychiatric disorders compared to the control group (χ 2 = 29.389; P = .001). Statistically significant difference in the diagnosis of severe depression, chronic depression disorder, and specific phobia was discovered between the 2 groups (P < .05).

No statistically significant difference was found between the patient and control groups in terms of the frequency of personality disorders. (χ 2 = 0.045; P = .833). The fact that depression and anxiety symptoms are more common in hypertension patients stands out as a subject that needs further investigation in terms of both the pathophysiology of hypertension. In this regard, since essential hypertension is a serious risky disease for mortality and morbidity on its own, it is critical to conduct psychiatric screening and develop new additional treatments to provide patients with supportive care.",

We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for studies examining associations between preoperative mental disorders, assessed by various scales, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (MSPQ), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and postoperative outcomes, such as pain, disability, quality of life, and satisfaction, in scoliosis surgery. Random-effects meta-analyses pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) in postoperative outcomes between patients with and without mental disorders. Twelve observational studies were included for the systematic review, and 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated significantly worse postoperative outcomes in patients with mental disorders compared to those without (SMD -1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.08 to -0.84, P < 0.001). Significant heterogeneity was present (I2 = 76%). Review of included studies found mental disorders linked to higher preoperative pain/disability and lower quality of life/satisfaction, as well as worse postoperative scores on these outcomes. Moderating factors identified included mental disorder severity, treatment specifics, and patient demographics. Preoperative mental disorders, especially depression and anxiety, are associated with significantly worse postoperative pain, disability, quality of life, and satisfaction in scoliosis surgery. This association may be mediated by psychological factors, such as catastrophizing, self-criticism, and kinesiophobia, and biological factors, such as inflammation, neuroendocrine changes, and central sensitization. Routine psychological screening and interventions for high-risk patients may improve postoperative outcomes but not necessarily surgical effectiveness. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate optimal treatment approaches.",

This cross-sectional study aims to explore the relationship between depression and severe bronchial asthma in children, focusing on the impact of alexithymia and somatic symptoms. The study includes a total of 186 children aged 6-14 years diagnosed with severe bronchial asthma between 2008 and 2022 in our institute. Alexithymia was assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 items (TAS-20). Somatization symptoms were measured using the children's somatization inventory (CSI). The Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate depression. Spearman correlation analysis was used to describe the correlation between alexithymia, somatization symptoms, and depression. Children with bronchial asthma are found to have a significantly higher prevalence of depression, estimated to be around 16.67%. Approximately 98.92% of children exhibit varying degrees of somatic symptoms. Approximately 3.23% of children have alexithymia. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed that somatic symptoms and alexithymia were positive correlated with the depression. The correlation coefficients were 0.986 and 0.981 (P < .01), respectively. moreover, according to the results of multiple linear regression analysis, somatization symptoms and alexithymia significantly affects depression in children with severe bronchitis asthma (P < .01). These findings suggest that children with severe bronchial asthma experience a higher prevalence of depression, impacting their overall quality of life. In addition, the presence of somatic symptoms is prevalent among these children, further contributing to the burden on their quality of life. Moreover, somatization symptoms and alexithymia have been identified as a significant factor positive affecting depression in this population. Addressing these factors in clinical interventions may be beneficial for improving the overall well-being in this population.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is often associated with volumetric reductions in cortices and expansions in basal ganglia, particularly the putamen. Recent genome-wide association studies have highlighted the significance of variants in the 3' regulatory region adjacent to the kinectin 1 gene (KTN1) in regulating gray matter volume (GMV) of the putamen. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the involvement of this region in schizophrenia. We analyzed 1136 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire 3' regulatory region in 4 independent dbGaP samples (4604 schizophrenia patients vs. 4884 healthy subjects) and 3 independent Psychiatric Genomics Consortium samples (107 240 cases vs. 210 203 controls) to identify consistent associations. Additionally, we examined the regulatory effects of schizophrenia-associated alleles on KTN1 mRNA expression in 16 brain areas among 348 subjects, as well as GMVs of 7 subcortical nuclei in 38 258 subjects, and surface areas (SA) and thickness (TH) of the entire cortex and 34 cortical areas in 36 936 subjects. The major alleles (f > 0.5) of 25 variants increased (β > 0) the risk of schizophrenia across 2 to 5 independent samples (8.4 × 10-4 ≤ P ≤ .049). These schizophrenia-associated alleles significantly elevated (β > 0) GMVs of basal ganglia, including the putamen (6.0 × 10-11 ≤ P ≤ 1.1 × 10-4), caudate (8.7 × 10-4 ≤ P ≤ 9.4 × 10-3), pallidum (P = 6.0 × 10-4), and nucleus accumbens (P = 2.7 × 10-5). Moreover, they potentially augmented (β > 0) the SA of posterior cingulate and insular cortices, as well as the TH of frontal (pars triangularis and medial orbitofrontal), parietal (superior, precuneus, and inferior), and temporal (transverse) cortices, but potentially reduced (β < 0) the SA of the whole, frontal (medial orbitofrontal), and temporal (pole, superior, middle, and entorhinal) cortices, as well as the TH of rostral middle frontal and superior frontal cortices (8.9 × 10-4 ≤ P ≤ .050). Our findings identify significant and functionally relevant risk alleles in the 3' regulatory region adjacent to KTN1, implicating their crucial roles in the development of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Acute cerebral infarction (ACI) has a high mortality and disability, which brings a heavy burden to the medical and health system. This study aims to discover the clinical prevalence of post-stroke depression (PSD) in patients with ACI, explore the predictive factors leading to this complication, and provide more evidence for better identification of PSD in clinic. From April 2021 to April 2023, this retrospective study selected 166 ACI patients as the research subjects, collected clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators at baseline, and observed the prevalence of PSD using the Hamilton depression scale 17 and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Multiple logistic regression analysis was adopted to explore the predictive factors of PSD in patients with ACI. The total incidence of PSD was 35.54% in 166 patients with ACI. The score of National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the score of daily life ability scale (ADL), and homocysteine (Hcy) level in the PSD group were higher than non-PSD group (P NIHSS < .001, P ADL < .001, P Hcy = .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high Hcy levels, NIHSS scores, and ADL scores were independent risk factors for PSD (P Hcy =.038, P NIHSS =.002, P ADL <.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that areas under curve (AUC) = 0.894, standard errora = 0.025, progressive significanceb <.001, 95% CI = 0.845-0.943, cut-off value = 0.520, sensitivity = 91.60%, specificity = 74.60%, and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test P = .246, suggesting that ROC curve has a certain clinical predictive efficacy. The prevalence of early PSD in patients with ACI is relatively high. Homocysteine levels, NIHSS scores and ADL scores may be independent risk factors for PSD, and targeted clinical intervention should be implemented for the above factors.",

    "abstract": "In order to determine whether intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a viable adjunct treatment for schizophrenia, a meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. Four independent researchers extracted and synthesized data from RCTs on adjunctive iTBS for patients suffering from schizophrenia. RevMan 5.3 software was used to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fifteen RCTs involving 671 patients with schizophrenia were included. Adjunctive iTBS was significantly superior to sham interventions for improvement in overall psychopathology (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI: -1.10, -0.41, I 2 = 64%, P < .0001), negative symptoms (SMD = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.18, -0.35, I 2 = 78%, P = .0003), and general psychopathology (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI: -0.88, -0.14, I 2 = 71%, P = .007), though no significant group difference was found regarding positive symptoms. Adjunctive iTBS also demonstrated superiority over control treatments in improving cognitive functions as measured by the Spatial Span Test (SMD = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.16, 1.49, I 2 = 73%, P = .02) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.88, I 2 = 0%, P = .01). Discontinuation rates (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.57, 1.50, I 2 = 0%, P = .75) and adverse events were comparable between groups. The use of iTBS in patients with schizophrenia appears to be effective in improving psychiatric symptoms and cognitive function. To substantiate these preliminary findings, future research involving larger participant cohorts is warranted.",

The purpose of this study was to compare subjects with non-suicidal self-injury and subjects with suicide attempts in relation to anger rumination and also to determine if there is a relationship between anger rumination with non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts, and if so, to determine the direction of this relationship. In this study, 42 subjects with suicide attempts and 42 subjects with non-suicidal self-injury were included. Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory, and Anger Rumination Scale were applied to all participants, Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire to those with suicide attempts, and Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury to those with non-suicidal self-injury. Those with non-suicidal self-injury group had significantly higher thoughts of revenge (P = .038), angry afterthoughts (P = .047), and a higher total score of Anger Rumination Scale (P = .025) than those with suicide attempts group. The Beck Depression Inventory scores of suicide attempts group were significantly higher than those of non-suicidal self-injury group (P = .001). A positive and significant correlation was found between Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire and Anger Rumination Scale-total score (r = 0.322, P = .037) and Beck Depression Inventory score (r = 0.440, P = .004). Individuals with non-suicidal self-injury have more anger rumination, angry afterthoughts, and revenge-related thoughts following anger experiences than individuals with suicide attempts. As the severity of suicidal behavior of individuals with suicide attempts increases, so does their anger rumination. Our study may shed light on a better understanding of non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts and even contribute to intervention programs for these behaviors.",

Finally, the one-way analysis of variance and independent samples t-test were utilized for comparing the Coronavirus Worry Scale scores between different socio-demographic and clinical variables. Higher Coronavirus Worry Scale scores suggested higher COVID-19 worry. Exploratory factor analysis explored the single-factor structure of the Turkish Coronavirus Worry Scale and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed this single-factor structure with good model fits. This scale had good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.92, McDonald's ω = 0.92). The Coronavirus Worry Scale scores were significantly positively correlated with the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (r = 0.41, P < .01), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (r =0.67, P < .01), Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (r = 0.54, P < .01), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (r = 0.36, P < .01). COVID-19 worry was higher in females, those who had a chronic disease, the loss of first-degree or other relatives or close friends due to COVID-19, or those who had never been vaccinated for COVID-19. Those who obeyed the COVID-19 rules, such as wearing masks and physical distancing had higher Coronavirus Worry Scale scores. Also, those who avoided crowded environments to protect themselves from COVID-19 transmission had higher Coronavirus Worry Scale scores. These findings show that the Turkish Coronavirus Worry Scale is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing COVID-19 worry.",

    "abstract": "Long-acting methylphenidate (MPH), a psychostimulant agent, is widely used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methylphenidate might cause an increment in the risk of lethal arrhythmias by deteriorating ventricular repolarization. QT intervals, the corrected QT (QTc), QT dispersion, T-peak to T-end (TpTe), and the TpTe/QTc ratio are the most utilized indicators of ventricular repolarization in electrocardiogram (ECG). The present study was conducted to examine the effects of long-term MPH use on the ECG in pediatric patients. A total of 52 children with ADHD and 51 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled in the study. The children had been using MPH regularly for at least 6 months. Comparisons were made regarding ECG parameters, including the mean intervals of QT, QTc, QTc dispersion interval duration, TpTe intervals, TpTe/QT, and TpTe/QTc ratio. The median duration of treatment with MPH was 30 months (minimum-maximum: 6-120), and the median MPH dose was 30 mg/day (minimum-maximum: 18-54). The main findings showed significantly prolonged P-wave dispersion, TpTe interval, TpTe dispersion, and TpTe/QT and TpTe/QTc ratios in the ADHD group compared to the healthy controls (P < .001). These parameters were not associated with MPH dose or treatment duration. Additionally, nearly half of the patients had QTc values of 460 ms or higher, but there were no significant differences in treatment duration and dose compared to the remaining group (P = .792 and P = .126). Methylphenidate may have proarrhythmogenic effects in children with ADHD, which may not be adversely affected by long-term use and treatment dose. Considering the extensive use of MPH, cardiac monitoring of these children is important.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the psychological counseling intention of college students, the attitude of seeking psychological help, and the related factors of shame so as to promote the psychological health of college students. In 4 comprehensive colleges with sound psychological counseling centers, students of different grades were selected and divided into an active help-seeking group (n = 216) and a help-refusal group (n = 270). Students' shame behaviors were evaluated using the Self-Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH) scale and Self-Stigma Scale (SSS). The intention of psychological counseling was measured by the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. The Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services was used to evaluate the psychological status. Data from the above scales were compared through the t-test. Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the impact of shame on the intention of psychological counseling. The study found that the active help-seeking group scored lower on SSOSH scale compared to those in the help-refusal group (total score: 41.2 ± 9.1 vs. 37.9 ± 8.7, P = .0017). Meanwhile, the help-refusal group had higher scores on the shame dimension of the SSS (16.2 ± 3.9 vs. 5.3 ± 1.1, P = .00085). After adjusting for age, gender, and other variables, multiple linear regression analysis indicated a negative correlation between shame and intention of psychological help and counseling, revealing a significant impact of shame on professional psychological counseling (P < .05). Our study findings suggest that shame has a negative impact on the intention of seeking psychological help and counseling among college students, highlighting the importance of addressing shame-related factors to promote psychological health and encourage the utilization of professional psychological counseling services.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of bipolar disorder (BD), a complex psychiatric condition, remains uncertain. Previous research has suggested a potential involvement of the host immune system in the development of BD. This study aims to investigate plasma levels of cytokines, circulating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in patients with bipolar depression. This study recruited patients with a depressive episode of BD and healthy controls (HCs). Inflammatory cytokines were quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. A total of 26 BD patients with a depressive episode and 14 HCs were enrolled in the study. The findings revealed that individuals with BD with a depressive episode exhibited elevated serum levels of NLRP3 and interleukin-18 compared to HCs. Correlation analyses indicated a favorable association between the frequency of episodes, duration of illness, and TLR4 levels. The results suggest a connection between cytokines associated with the activation of NLRP3 and their potential impact on the pathogenesis of BD.",

Male children (10-18 years old) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 30) and without any diagnosis (n = 30) were evaluated using Questionnaire of Computer/Internet Use of Children and Adolescents (Children-Adolescent Form and Parent Form), Children's Aggression Scale-Parent Version, Young Internet Addiction Scale, and Cyber Bullying and Online Aggression Survey Instrument. Weekly internet/computer using time, Young Internet Addiction Scale scores, Children's Aggression Scale-Parent Version scores were higher in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group. When all participants included in the study were compared for the availability of rules related to the PC/internet use at their homes, it was determined that there were rules by 53.3%, and the rate of setting rules was higher in the control group than attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group. There is a high level of positive correlation between Internet Addiction Scale score and duration in internet use in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group. Those who experienced cyberbullying throughout their lives were at a higher rate in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group compared to the control group. \"Physical aggression without provoking\" subgroup of Children's Aggression Scale-Parent Version is correlated with cyberbullying in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group and cyber victimization in the control group. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have higher levels of aggression and pathological internet use than healthy controls, but there is no difference between cyberbullying and victimization. Cyberbullying/victimization is independent of diagnosis. For this reason, it is necessary to create awareness and preventive measures of cyberbullying.",

    "abstract": "In males, one of the most common sexual dysfunction is lifelong premature ejaculation. Sexual dysfunctions, including premature ejaculation, are highly prevalent in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in patients with lifelong premature ejaculation. In this study, 48 patients diagnosed with lifelong premature ejaculation and 40 controls were included. All patients and controls were asked to fill out Wender-Utah Rating Scale-25 and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale. Patients also filled out the Arabic Index of Premature Ejaculation and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool. Totally 20 patients (41.66%) with lifelong premature ejaculation and 2 (5%) controls were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The mean scores of the Wender-Utah Rating Scale-25, Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale, and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-hyperactivity-impulsivity subscale were higher in the case group (P = .001, P = .001, and P < .001, respectively). No difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of the Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-Inattention subtype (P = .492). In the lifelong premature ejaculation group, 13 patients (65%) diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder were found to be attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder-predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity subtype. The findings of the current study reveal that patients with lifelong premature ejaculation should be assessed carefully in terms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially hyperactive and impulsive characteristics, and the relationship between lifelong premature ejaculation and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder should be examined by further studies with large samples.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the retinovascular structure of schizophrenia patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). 47 eyes of schizophrenia patients were compared with 50 eyes of demographically matched healthy controls in terms of OCTA measurements. Schizophrenia patients were evaluated in two groups as short-term (≤ 5years) and long-term (> 5years) according to the time elapsed after the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients showed overall thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer and macula, and lower vessel density (VD) compared to controls. The results were significant for thickness measurements of general macula and for VD in specific areas (P < 0.05); however, they were not significant for the RNFL measurements except the mean circumpapillary RNFL, which was noted to approach significance (P = 0.055). Long-term patients showed significantly lower VD in the whole and perifoveal region of superficial capillary plexus, the whole, perifoveal and foveal region of deep capillary plexus, and the whole area and the disc of radial peripapillary capillaries compared to short-term patients (P = 0.014, P = 0.009, P = 0.011, P = 0.010, P = 0.011, P = 0.035, P = 0.030). These findings suggest that schizophrenia may be a neurodegenerative disease with progressive microvascular involvement over the years, and that OCTA has the potential to be a useful tool in detecting retinovascular changes in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Metacognitive therapy is a relatively novel and growing psychotherapeutic approach. Within the last 20 years, several metacognitive-oriented therapy methods have been developed. They are metacognitive therapy which was developed by Wells, metacognitive training which was produced by Moritz et al. especially for patients with psychotic disorder, and metacognitive reflection and insight therapy for psychotic patients. Among them, the most structured one seems the metacognitive therapy. The main notion of metacognitive therapy is to alter the dysfunctional metacognitive interpretations and strategies underlying psychopathology. However, it should be emphasized that it has some fundamental differences from cognitive behavioral therapy because metacognitive therapy is a relatively new school of cognitive therapy, its effectiveness in the treatment of many psychiatric disorders continues to be evaluated intensively. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of these disorders. As obsessive-compulsive disorder is a lifelong disorder that causes significant loss of workforce and pharmacotherapy is sometimes insufficient, psychotherapeutic approaches are of great importance. In this context, exposure and response prevention still seems to be an important treatment option in terms of psychotherapeutic approaches. However, it is clear that a new approach is required in psychiatry practice in cases where exposure and response prevention and classical cognitive behavioral therapy are not sufficient and remain with residual symptoms. In this respect, metacognitive therapy can be an important alternative to fill this gap. However, more evidence needs to be created with studies with much larger samples.",

From May 2019 to November 2019, patients were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry, Cancer Center in Busan, Korea. For gene expression studies, primers were designed using the Primer3 web tool (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3), and amplification reactions were performed. Expression levels of NR3C1 were lower in cancer depression and general depression than in cancer non-depression group. Given that we observed downregulation of the NR3C1 gene expression in depressive patients regardless of cancer status, it appears that methylation changes in NR3C1 may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. The results of this study imply that the expression of NR3C1 may be decreased in major depressive disorder.",

This study adapts and validates the mental health screening tool the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire for use in Georgian children.A total of 16 654 children were assessed by a parent and/or teacher using Georgian-adapted Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to assess the discriminative validity of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaires and to establish an optimal cutoff score.Data from 15 738 parents- and 13 560 teachers-administered Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire were analyzed. The internal consistency analysis showed Cronbach's alpha to be 0.625 and 0.621 for parent- and teacher-administered Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, respectively. The area under the curve (95% CI) shows that the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire can differentiate risk group children from typically developing peers: parent-administered questionnaires-0.629 (0.556-0.702) and teacher-administered questionnaires-0.680 (0.611-0.789). Parent-administered Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire has a cutoff value of 16 or more with 92.5% of sensitivity and teacher-administered Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire-14 or more with a sensitivity of 85.6%.The study finds that the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire is a valid screening instrument and does not depend on the informant-parent or teacher. It suggests that with appropriate cultural adaptation, the SDQ can be used in the Republic of Georgia to identify children at risk for mental disorders and help guide resource allocation.",

The present study aimed to develop a scale to measure the coronavirus disease 2019-induced perceived stigmatization in physicians and investigate its validity and reliability. The present methodological type of study was carried out with 303 physicians working with a university hospital. The researchers drafted a 5-point Likert-type \"Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Perceived Stigmatization in Physicians Scale\" by using an item pool consisting of 35 items upon a review of the relevant literature. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient), item-total correlation coefficient, and test-retest analyses were used to assess the reliability of the scale. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed with an aim to evaluate the construct validity of the scale. The scale consisted of 10 items and 2 domains (environmental perceived stigmatization and personally perceived stigmatization) upon completion of the scale development step. The items on the scale explained 61.66% of the total variance, where the factor loads were between 0.66 and 0.85. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.88, and the item-total correlation coefficients were all above 0.3. As a result of confirmatory factor analysis, the resultant model had goodness-of-fit indices with sufficient fit. The Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Perceived Stigmatization in Physicians Scale was a reliable and valid tool for the physicians.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between environmental factors, disease diagnosis and severity with psychopathology using nonrecursive models included in structural equation modeling. Within the scope of the study, 378 patients' demographic characteristics, as well as their responses to the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and Personal and Social Performance Scale were included. They were diagnosed with the International Classification of Diseases after assessment of the physician, severity of the symptoms were determined using the Clinical Global Impression Scale. The causal relationship between environmental factors and disease diagnosis with psychopathology was evaluated with the Stata program using the 3-stage least squares method within the scope of nonrecursive models. The mean age of the patients participating in the study was 37.3 (SD = 11.6); 61.6% were women, 58.8% had high school or lower education, 48.7% were married, and 72.1% had an income above the minimum wage. The mean score of support perceived by individuals from the environment (family, friend, partner) was 53.9 (SD = 18.9), the mean of self-esteem score was 22.8 (SD = 5.7), and the mean of trauma they experienced in their childhood due to abuse/neglect was 44.5 (SD = 12.1). It was concluded that age and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire neglect subheadings were effective in the self-esteem score, and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire neglect and abuse subheadings were effective in perceived social support (P < .001). When the causality relationships between Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Personal and Social Performance Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support scores were evaluated, childhood trauma and age were determined as significant variables for self-esteem, childhood trauma for perceived support, and disease severity and diagnosis in individual and social functionality.",

People who accepted to participate in the study, who did not have any additional diseases, who had the ability to understand the questionnaires, and who did not use medications during the 3 months preceding the study onset were enrolled. The levels of vasopressin and oxytocin were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Twenty-eight subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder and 19 healthy controls were included. The 2 groups were not significantly different in terms of oxytocin blood levels (P = .481). However, subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder had a significantly lower vasopressin level than controls (P < .001). We found no significant correlations of trauma duration and scale scores with oxytocin or vasopressin levels.The findings of this study show that blood vasopressin may play a role in post-traumatic stress disorder.

    "abstract": "It has been known that there is a significant correlation between depression and cardiovascular diseases. However, the reasons behind this correlation that could affect mortality and morbidity were not fully identified. The present study aimed to analyze arterial stiffness diagnosed with ultrasonography, which could be associated with cardiovascular disease risks in depression patients, and to compare the findings with those of healthy controls.The study was conducted with 35 depression patients and 35 healthy individuals. Routine complete blood and biochemistry tests were requested for all patients, and their weight and height, waist circumference, and diastolic and systolic arterial blood pressure were measured. Femoral and carotid artery intima-media thickness and other arterial stiffness parameters were determined with Doppler ultrasonography.It was determined that the systolic pressure (P = .028) was higher in the patient group (P = .028). Also, the carotid elastic modulus (P = .048) was significantly higher in the patient group. A negative and significant correlation was determined between femoral compliance and chlorpromazine equivalent dose (P = .021, r = -0.389).It was determined that the systolic blood pressure and carotid elastic modulus arterial stiffness parameters were significantly higher in depression patients. Measurable arterial stiffness parameters should be investigated in depression patients as cardiovascular risk markers. Furthermore, the determination of the effects of psychotropic drugs employed in arterial stiffness treatment could play an important role in the determination of cardiovascular disease risk in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify regions with altered degrees of centrality (DC) and changes in their functional connectivity (FC) in first-episode drug-naïve major depressive disorder (FEDN-MDD) patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study included 74 FEDN-MDD patients who met the study criteria and 41 healthy controls (HCs). All had undergone fMRI scanning in the resting condition. To evaluate differences between FEDN-MDD patients and HCs, we first compared the DC between the 2 groups. The DC regions with the most significant differences were then taken as seeds, and their FC was calculated. Right posterior cingulum cortex (PCC.R), right precuneus (PCUN.R), and right putamen (PUT.R) all showed significantly different DC values (P < .001) between FEDN-MDD patients and HC groups, which helped in distinguishing these groups. The PUT.R in FEDN-MDD patients showed increased FC (P < .001) with the right inferior temporal gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus compared to HC. Moreover, the PCUN.R in FEDN-MDD patients showed decreased FC (P < .001) with bilateral cerebellum crus I, left cerebellum crus II, bilateral orbital medial frontal gyrus, right superior medial frontal gyrus, left precuneus, left posterior cingulum cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, and PCC.R compared with the HC group. The P-values for cluster testing were .050, while for voxel testing they were .001. These findings imply that PUT.R, PCUN.R, and PCC.R serve as the core brain net hub in FEDN-MDD patients, and their FC displays aberrant function. This may involve a specific psychiatric neuropathology associated with FEDN-MDD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with psoriasis and the association between depressive symptoms, perceived stress level, and quality of life of the participants. Patients with psoriasis were invited to complete the Thai versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale-10, Psoriasis Disability Index, and Simplified Psoriasis Index. To identify significantly related factors of depression, the independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare continuous variables between groups, and the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between groups. The association between the severity of depression and other variables was examined using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Of the 150 participants assessed, 32 (21.3%) had depressive symptoms. Elevated stress scores, subjective psychosocial impact of psoriasis, self-perceived current severity of psoriasis, and impaired quality of life were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptom severity was determined to be positively correlated with perceived stress, quality-of-life impairment, current severity, and the psychosocial impact of psoriasis. Depressive symptoms are prevalent among patients with psoriasis. Those with high scores for perceived stress, a psychosocial impact of psoriasis, or disease severity should be evaluated for depression, as it can hamper their quality of life.",

The sample of the present methodological study included 457 adolescents. The data were collected between February 10, 2019, and May 31, 2019, with a socio-demographic data form and the Positive Mental Health Literacy Scale. The scale was first translated to the Turkish language, expert opinion was obtained, and a pilot scheme was conducted. The content validity index was employed to test the validity of the scale, confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted to test the construct validity, item analysis was conducted to test the reliability of the scale, Cronbach's alpha analysis was employed to determine internal consistency, and the test-retest scores were compared to determine time invariance. The scale is unidimensional. The content validity analysis of the scale was 0.97. Scale item loads varied between 0.56 and 0.72 based on the confirmatory factor analysis. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.87, and the test-retest score was intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.739 (P < . 001). The mean participant score on the positive mental health literacy scale was 2.9 (SD=0.9). The validity and reliability findings in the study that was conducted to adapt the Positive Mental Health Literacy Scale to the Turkish language revealed that the scale could be used to measure the mental health literacy of adolescents. The Turkish version of the scale could be used in programs that aim to identify positive mental health literacy levels of adolescents in Turkish society.",

The Beck Anxiety Inventory, Impact of Event Scale-Revised to evaluate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal), Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory were used for the assessment. The tests were administered 3 times (pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 1-month follow-up).This study included 14 healthcare workers diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder; 2 (14.3%) physicians, 2 (14.3%) nurses, 4 (28.6%) other-healthcare workers/medical staff, and 6 (42.8%) other healthcare workers/non-medical staff. There was a significant decrease in Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score, the intrusion and hyper-arousal sub-scores between T1 and T2 (P = .018; P = .005; P = .0005, respectively) and between T1 and T3 (P < .001; P < .001; P < .001, respectively), but there was no difference between T2 and T3 (P = .89). A significant difference was found in repeated measurements of both Beck Depression Inventory [P < .001] and Beck Anxiety Inventory [P < .001] scores. There was a significant difference in emotional exhaustion, one of the subscales of Maslach Burnout Inventory (P = .09). However, there was no significant difference in depersonalization (P = .48) and personal accomplishment (P = .66).Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol appears to be capable of reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, intrusion, and hyperarousal symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and emotional exhaustion when symptoms that developed are related to the pandemic in healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": ": The majority of research on parenting behaviors in social phobia has been conducted with mother-child dyads, but there is still a gap in current knowledge about the role of fathers' parenting behaviors and adolescence period. This study focuses on the role of parent gender, parental attitudes, and familial factors in an adolescent population. Our study sample consisted of adolescents diagnosed with social phobia (n = 60), healthy non-clinical adolescents (n = 30), and the parents of adolescents with social phobia (n = 46) and non-clinical adolescents (n = 30). A Sociodemographic Information Form, Family Interview Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and The Parent Attitude Research Instrument were administered to all groups. The parents of adolescents with social phobia have reported a higher overprotective mothering attitude when compared to parents of healthy adolescents (P mother < .001 and P father = .009). The mothers' overprotective parenting style and the fathers' avoidance levels were found as predictive factors for adolescents' social phobia in logistic regression analysis (respectively; exp(β) = 0.868 and P = .002; exp(β) = 0.927 and P = .017). Our results indicate the necessity of considering both the parents in the research. We suggest that controlled prospective future studies on different ages, diagnostic groups, and cultures, which will take the gender of both parents and patients into account, may reveal important data on the relation between parenting behaviors and social anxiety.",

The study group included 42 obsessive-compulsive disorder patients who were admitted to and diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder at the outpatient psychiatry clinic of Karadeniz Technical University Medical School between December 2017 and November 2018 and their 24 siblings who were born to and raised by the same parents and 42 volunteers. Diagnoses were based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria. The patients filled out the Young Schema Questionnaire Short Form-3 and the Yale-Brown Obsession-Compulsion Scale. The groups were similar in terms of age, sex, marital status, occupation, presence of comorbidity, and income level. The comparison of the scores of Young Schema Questionnaire Short Form-3 subscales revealed significant differences among the groups in failure, pessimism, social isolation/alienation, approval-seeking, enmeshment, abandonment, punishment, and defectiveness schemas. The post hoc analysis revealed that pessimism and defectiveness were significantly different between the patient and sibling groups, and approval-seeking, enmeshment, and abandonment were significantly different between the control and the sibling groups. The comparison of the Yale-Brown Obsession-Compulsion Scale and the Young Schema Questionnaire Short Form-3 results revealed that the subscales of enmeshment, failure, approval-seeking, and unrelenting standards were significantly correlated with the obsession and compulsion subscales and the total score in the Yale-Brown Obsession-Compulsion Scale. We found similarities between early maladaptive schemas in the obsessive-compulsive disorder patients and their healthy siblings. We also found differences between the siblings and the healthy controls. These findings suggest a familial and genetic basis for the early maladaptive schemas in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, which should be further evaluated in future studies with larger samples.",

Certain personality traits may come to the fore in psychosomatic disorders; these traits are thought to make the person vulnerable to psychosomatic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the personality traits, anxiety sensitivity (AS), anxiety, and depression levels in patients diagnosed with psychogenic pruritus (PP). Thirty-seven patients diagnosed with PP (patient group) and 21 healthy controls were included in the study. Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) were administered to all participants. Patients' EPQ scores for the extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and lie subdimensions and EPQ-total scores were significantly higher than those of the control group (P = .001; P < .001; P < .001; P = .008; P < .001, respectively). The total score of ASI-3 scale and the scores of all subdimensions (physical, cognitive, and social) were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < .001). The BAI (26.8 ± 9.3) and BDI (24.2 ± 8.6) total scores of the patients were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < .001). According to EPQ, patients diagnosed with PP are extroverted, but also cold, distrustful, and aloof; show impulsive behavior; are anxious, depressed, and nervous; overly emotional; and prone to lying. Patients suffer more from anxiety, depressive symptoms, and AS in physical, cognitive, and social subdimensions than healthy people. Our findings highlight the importance of psychiatric assessment in PP patients. In this context, we believe that PP deserves to be studied in a broad spectrum with its cognitive, behavioral, and social aspects.",

We analyzed the clinical features and treatment of patients with non-severe COVID-19 who were hospitalized in neurology and psychiatry departments due to acute psychiatric disorders and performed a descriptive analysis. Of the 57 patients included, 65% were hospitalized in the neurology department. Eighty-two percent of the patients exhibited abnormal mental behavior 1 week or less after COVID-19 diagnosis, and more than 60% of the patients had normal electroencephalogram (EEG), head imaging, autoimmune encephalitis antibody, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. Abnormal EEG results included an increase in nonspecific slow waves, abnormal imaging results included small ischemic areas and lacunar infarctions, and abnormal CSF results included a slight increase in cell numbers and protein levels and an increase in pressure. After administering antipsychotic drugs and/or immunotherapy, 67% of the patients experienced improvement in their psychiatric disorders by the time of discharge. Thirty-nine percent of the patients were discharged without antipsychotic medication and experienced no relapse of psychiatric symptoms. Patients with non-severe COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders usually have a good prognosis and do not require long-term antipsychotic medication. Patients with uncontrollable mental symptoms experienced rapid remission after immunotherapy, suggesting that inflammation or the immune response may play an important role in the occurrence of simple acute psychiatric disorders caused by COVID-19.",

The aim of the study is to examine the psychometric properties of the PAS in a sample of Turkish schizophrenic patients. The research was carried out with 80 patients with schizophrenia and 50 healthy people. The sociodemographic form and PAS were applied to both groups. In addition, the Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS)-II and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were applied to the patients. In the statistical evaluation, the internal consistency coefficient, explanatory factor analysis, and correlation with other scales were calculated. The average age of the schizophrenia group was 39.15 ± 12.19 and 45.9 ± 12.18 for control. The average years of education (9.91 ± 3.79 for the schizophrenia group and 11.08 ± 4.73 for control) and gender distribution (55% of the schizophrenia group and 46% of the control group were female) were similar. The internal consistency of the PAS was 0.93, and the subscales were between 0.75 and 0.92. Two-factor solution was observed, explaining 72.97% of the total variance. In regard to convergent validity, the correlation coefficients between the total scores of DAS II and PAS and PAS late and early adolescence and childhood were 0.45, 0.53, 0.48, 0.37, and 0.22, respectively (P < .001). The correlation coefficients between the total score of PAS and the total score of DAS 1, DAS 3, DAS 4, DAS 5, and DAS 6 were calculated as 0.46, 0.43, 0.39, 0.48, and 0.44 (P < .001), respectively.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to identify the risk factors associated with nonsuicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behavior in patients with depressive disorders and develop predictive models utilizing these influencing factors as predictors, followed by validation of the constructed models for their efficacy. Patients with depression disorders admitted to Wuhan Mental Health Center from 2020 to 2021 were included using retrospective analysis. Patients who exhibited one or more items on the NSSI behavior rating questionnaire were categorized into the NSSI group, while those without any such behaviors were assigned to the non-NSSI group. Patients in both groups were categorized separately based on gender, age, personality traits, and interpersonal relationships. The above data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Prediction models were constructed, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced and model accuracy was calculated. A total of 237 patients were included in this study, with 122 patients assigned to the NSSI group and 115 patients assigned to the non-NSSI group. By comparing the baseline data of the patients in the 2 groups, the results revealed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, grades at school, early childhood parenting style, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECRS) (P＜.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed for the remaining indicators (P＞.05). The results of the multiple logistic regression model showed that grades at school, early childhood parenting style, HAMD, HAMA, and ECRS scores were risk factors. The ROC model was constructed using school performance, childhood parenting style, HAMD, HAMA, and ECRS scores as predictors. The findings indicated that the ECRS score was the best predictor of NSSI, and it had a sensitivity of 91.8% and specificity of 70.5% for an area of 0.967. ECRS was utilized as a predictor to evaluate the NSSI inclination of depressed patients with commendable sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, early childhood parenting style, HAMD, HAMA, and ECRS scores were identified as risk factors for NSSI. For individuals at high risk who exhibit these aforementioned risk factors, clinical diagnosis and treatment should be approached with caution.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of detached mindfulness (DM) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Seventeen adult patients with OCD, who were receiving psychotropic medication, were included in the study. M.A., a qualified metacognitive therapist at the Metacognitive Therapy Institute in Manchester, conducted DM therapy. The Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to monitor clinical progress. The mean Y-BOCS scores at baseline and the end of the study were 25.29 ± 5.70 and 13.53 ± 3.41, respectively, and a paired t-test analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between baseline and end-of-treatment scores (P<.001). The homework practices were also assessed in sessions 2, 3, and 4. The mean homework scores at the second, third, and fourth homework sessions were 8.70 ± 1.10, 8.00 ± 0.79 and 8.20 ± 1.1, respectively. The DM homework completion rate was at an acceptable level. In conclusion, our study has shown that the DM technique, one of the main techniques used in metacognitive therapy, is significantly beneficial in patients with a certain degree of severity. We are of the opinion that supportive studies with larger sample sizes are necessary for the demonstration of efficacy in patients with significant treatment resistance.",

This study aimed to analyze the high risk factors of BD after ischemic stroke and investigate prevention strategies. 197 patients with ischemic stroke in our hospital from March 2020 to March 2022 were selected as research subjects. The demographic information, clinical data, and scores of Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) in patients were retrospectively analyzed to count the incidence of BD in patients. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors for BD after ischemic stroke, and preventive measures were discussed based on study results. The incidence of BD in patients with ischemic stroke was 45.18% (89/197), and the median and quartile in the first part of MDQ score was 6.00 (5.00,10.00) points. The subjects were divided into BD group (n = 89) and non-BD group (n = 108) based on the presence of BD in patients with ischemic stroke. Education background (OR = 0.485), lesions involving the frontal or temporal lobes (OR = 2.724), sleep disorders (OR = 2.246), and daily living ability (OR = 3.108) were influencing factors for BD after ischemic stroke (P < .05). The risk of BD after ischemic stroke is high. Based on the above research results, clinical attention should be paid to knowledge popularization, lesion examination, and the improvement of sleep quality and daily living ability, to prevent the occurrence of BD and improve the prognosis.",

It is unclear whether early breastfeeding behavior is associated with PND symptoms in China. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between PND symptoms and breastfeeding patterns for infants based on a large cohort. A prospective study was conducted in a community cohort from March 2021 to December 2022. In this study, maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). The assessments were carried out 1 week before and 1 month after delivery. The socio-demographic information of the mothers, their intention to breastfeed, and their feeding status were investigated one-on-one by the hospital's trained medical staff through self-designed questionnaires. The maternity information and physical examination results were obtained through the healthcare records of the patients. A total of 442 pregnant women were included in the study, and the total detection rate of PND was 29.41%, among which the detection rate of mild PND was 24.66%, and the detection rate of severe depression was 4.75%. About 61.99% of the mothers had exclusive breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery, and 83.71% had exclusive breastfeeding within 24 hours after delivery. The proportion of mothers with PND symptoms and those without PND symptoms who exclusively breastfed for the first time after delivery was 71.54% and 91.67%, respectively. The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding for mothers without depressive symptoms was 3(1,5) months, while the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding for mothers with depressive symptoms was 2(1,3) months, indicating that the duration of exclusive breastfeeding for mothers without depressive symptoms was longer (P < 0.05). There was an association between perinatal depressive symptoms and exclusive breastfeeding. Addressing perinatal depressive symptoms may extend the duration of exclusive breastfeeding.",

A total of 51 children with ASD aged between 6 and 18 years took part in the study. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were used to evaluate ASD symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and perceived social support, respectively. The cases were assessed before and 6 months after the pandemic. Our findings indicated that after the onset of the pandemic hyperactivity scores of children with ASD increased, whereas perceived social support of their parents decreased, compared to their pre-pandemic levels (P-value < .05). The increase in hyperactivity and irritability levels among children were positively associated with the presence of a chronic illness in the family and medication discontinuation (P-value < .05). Quarantine in the COVID-19 pandemic may cause or worsen behavioral problems among children with ASD possibly due to problems related to poor medication adherence and lowered perceived social support among their parents. Clinicians working with children with special needs may be pro-active to assess and manage emotional/behavioral problems among this special population particularly during difficult times such as pandemic.",

Conducted among 30 mothers of 3-month-old infants admitted to the NICU with CP and a control group (n = 30), it analyzed the impact of medical intervention durations and breastfeeding initiation on maternal stress and attachment using statistical methods. The maternal stress in the NICU group was significantly higher than in the control group (P = .014). However, there was no significant difference between the groups in attachment scores (P = .141). The study revealed that longer invasive mechanical ventilation (P < .001) and NICU stay (P < .001) significantly increased maternal stress. Maternal stress (P < .001) and breastfeeding initiation time(P < .001) exhibit a negative correlation with attachment scores (P < .001). It is crucial to implement interventions aimed at reducing maternal stress and fostering maternal-infant attachment for mothers of newborns admitted to the NICU. The sustained application of these interventions post discharge holds significance for the mental health of mothers and mother-infant attachment.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine the impact of spousal support on postpartum depression in women with different attachment styles and assessing if attachment style influences this effect. From March to May 2022, 96 couples with late-stage pregnant women were randomly selected from tertiary maternity hospitals in Shandong and Guangdong provinces for a prepartum survey. Psychological assessments were conducted using the Adult Attachment Scale, Dyadic Coping Inventory, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Depression Scale. To examine the relationship between each variable and postpartum depression, univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed. Additionally, interaction analysis was used to analyze the interplay between different attachment styles and how spousal support influences women's postpartum depression. The findings revealed that even after accounting for confounding variables, prepartum spousal support was an independent predictor of postpartum depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.96, P = .015). Women with a secure attachment style showed a significantly lower incidence of postpartum depression compared to those with insecure attachment styles (24.2% vs. 46%, P = .037). In the secure attachment group, spousal support had a protective effect against postpartum depression (adjusted OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.91, P = .018), and attachment style emerged as a potential interactive factor influencing the impact of spousal support on postpartum depression (P for interaction = .029). The provision of spousal support, especially to individuals with secure attachment styles, plays a preventive role in postpartum depression. This underscores the importance of considering attachment styles in interventions targeting postpartum depression prevention.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a prevalent health problem in older adults, and effective treatments remain to be produced. Serum vitamin D, a commonly used biochemical marker, is widely recognized as an indicator of various diseases. Existing research has not fully elucidated the relationship between vitamin D and cognitive function. The aim of this study is to investigate the real relationship between vitamin D and cognitive function and to identify indicators that have a strong predictive effect on cognitive decline. At first, we used the dataset of the genome-wide association studies studying vitamin D and cognitive performance to conduct Mendelian randomization analysis. Subsequently, we employed linear regression and smooth curve fitting methods to assess the relationship using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. Finally, we investigated other predictive features of cognitive performance utilizing a machine learning model. We found that a 1-unit increase in vitamin D is associated with a 6.51% reduction (P < .001) in the risk of cognitive decline. The correlation between vitamin D and cognitive performance is nonlinear, with the inflection point at 79.9 nmol/L (left: β = 0.043, P < .001; right: β = -0.007, P = .420). In machine learning, the top 5 predictors are vitamin D, weight, height, age, and body mass index. There is a causal relationship between vitamin D and cognitive performance. 79.9 nmol/L could be the optimal dose for vitamin D supplementation in the elderly. Further consideration of other factors in vitamin D interventions is necessary.",

A total of 289 individuals with brain metastases from lung cancer after radiotherapy participated. Data were collected from October 2018 to December 2022. Data were collected on variables such as patient demographics, medical characteristics, TEI, anxiety, depression, and QoL. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data. Correlation coefficients between TEI and anxiety, depression, and QoL scores were -0.451 (P = .007), -0.580 (P = .002), and 0.391 (P = .009). The correlation coefficient for depression and QoL was -0.433 (P = .008). Anxiety and depression mediate the positive correlation between trait EI and QoL. Individuals with high idiosyncrasies of emotional intelligence are able to more effectively regulate negative emotions associated with cancer symptoms and treatment, and thus better perceive QoL. Trait EI training can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms and further improve the QoL of lung cancer individuals.",

    "abstract": "Persons experiencing severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) constitute a small but vulnerable population in healthcare and society. Nonetheless, it is advocated to involve people with SPMI in research to improve how care is provided to them. However, qualitative research with this population is challenging due to several factors, including (self-) stigma, assessment of decision-making capacity, reduced communication skills, and the (perceived) risk of adverse events, resulting in relative scarcity in academic interest and scientific publications. In this contribution, the authors share their practical experiences in conducting qualitative research among this group of people, specifically focusing on sensitive topics including end-of-life care and palliative care approaches. Both beneficial and challenging factors encountered across the different research stages are systematically delineated and reflected upon. Qualitative research involving persons with SPMI necessitates a different perspective on methodology and requires specific competencies from researchers. As might be expected, adequate preparation, thorough follow-up, and support for all involved are critical success factors. Additionally, however, it may also require adopting a somewhat unconventional approach to qualitative interviewing, encouraging creativity and ethical reflection as guiding principles. Exploring alternative methodologies and non-conventional engagement in research could provide a much-needed voice to individuals who are currently unrepresented in the research discourse.",

The severity of MetS was found to be higher in men, older age groups, married people, subjects with a lower education level, urban residents, smokers, people with low physical activity, and DSPS. In the fully adjusted model, the odds of having MetS were 26% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.48) higher in those with DSPS compared to those without DSPS. Additionally, the odds of MetS were 18% higher in people who napped less than 1 hour per day, 26% higher in those who napped 1-2 hours per day, and 21% higher in those who napped over 2 hours per day, compared to non-nappers. All of these associations were statistically significant. The odds of having the severity of MetS were significantly 6% (95% CI: 0.01, 0.12) higher in those with DSPS compared to those without DSPS. The findings of this study indicate that DSPS and daytime napping are associated with an increased risk of MetS. Interventions aimed at improving sleep quality are recommended as potential strategies to help reduce the risk of developing MetS.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are health issues that are increasing worldwide. Patients with severe mental illness are particularly vulnerable for various reasons, including the intake of weight gain-associated drugs. In this pilot study, we targeted eating behavior as a predictor for medication-induced weight gain and developed a module of a prevention program (\"Eating More Consciously\") to be evaluated by psychiatric inpatients. Thirty-three patients participated in a behaviorally oriented group therapy program with 2 modules of 120 minutes each and weekly follow-up measurements over 4 weeks. Measures included weight, laboratory parameters, the German versions of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (Fragebogen Essverhalten; FEV) and the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) as well as a questionnaire on the implementation of the strategies in everyday life. Thirty-three participants completed both modules and felt that they had benefited from the module \"Eating More Consciously\". Fragebogen Essverhalten domain \"cognitive restraint\" scores increased significantly throughout the study (P = .039), and the FCI sum score decreased significantly (P = .003). We propose that the \"Eating More Consciously\" module is a promising approach to behavioral intervention in weight management in patients with severe mental illness. Prospective randomized controlled studies with a larger sample and a longer follow-up are needed.",

    "abstract": "There are studies in the literature that link restless legs syndrome with increasing cardiovascular disease risk. The reason for this was that increased sympathomimetic activation in restless legs syndrome causes tachycardia, hypertension, and autonomic instability. We intended to assess the cardiovascular disease risk in patients with restless legs syndrome using electrocardiogram parameters. The present investigation compared the demographic characteristics, electrocardiogram variables, and lab results of 40 patients diagnosed with restless legs syndrome with 43 healthy controls. Restless legs syndrome patients had a higher frontal QRS-T angle than healthy control patients. Restless legs syndrome patients had lower hemoglobin, neutrophil, lymphocyte, basophil, albumin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. There was a significant increase in eosinophil, platelet, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio values in patients with restless legs syndrome. The frontal QRS-T angle is highly correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = .001). Similarly, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio values were significantly correlated with frontal QRS-T (P = .011 and P = .24). The fact that frontal QRS-T angle and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were correlated in the restless legs syndrome group in our study suggests that the inflammatory process may have increased the risk of cardiovascular disease in restless legs syndrome patients. Our findings show that the frontal QRS-T angle is high in restless legs syndrome patients. We conclude that C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio are higher in the restless legs syndrome patient group and are related to cardiovascular disease risk.",

The Edwards test was used to detect any birth seasonality patterns among the patients with schizophrenia. Subsequently, the data were compared against the general population birth month data to examine potential seasonal effects using the Walter-Elwood seasonality test. There are 949 patients with schizophrenia, with a mean age of 39.3 years. The results demonstrate no evidence of distinctive seasonality in birth patterns among patients with schizophrenia (P = .329). The overall monthly distribution of births did not differ between the general population and patients with schizophrenia (P = .365).

Interventions included Soul Moisturizing Hall, Balint group, one-on-one interviews, and routine debriefing sessions. Psychological interventions for the nurses were carried out by a team of psychiatrists and senior clinical nurse specialists. The Work Stressors Questionnaire of Nurses in the Department of Oncology (WSQNDO) was used to measure the stress in nurses before and after intervention. A total of 27 female nurses were enrolled, with the majority of them aged <30 years. Following intervention, the scores in each of the WSQNDO dimensions were all significantly lower (P < .001) than prior to intervention (social factors and career prospect: 15.18 ± 3.67 vs. 11.11 ± 2.42; working environment and working nature: 20.22 ± 5.03 vs. 17.29 ± 4.87; professional skills: 19.11 ± 3.93 vs. 16.51 ± 3.27; stress from the patient and their family: 11.85 ± 3.07 vs. 10.37 ± 2.45; interpersonal relationship: 9.77 ± 2.54 vs. 8.62 ± 1.62; the problem of oncology specialist nursing: 41.03 ± 8.46 vs. 38.51 ± 6.30).

A cross-sectional study that included patients treated in an outpatient psychiatric clinic was conducted. The QTc duration was calculated using a combined QT correction (Bazett's formula for heart rate 60-100 and the Framingham formula for extremes of HR). Among 307 patients, about 60% received multiple psychotropic drugs. The LQTc frequency was 1.2%. QTc interval prolongation was observed in patients receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (P = .011), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (P = .033), citalopram (P = .044), or psychotropic polytherapy (P = .005). The addition of SSRIs to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) also lengthened the QTc interval (P = .029). There was a correlation between the number of psychotropic medications and the QTc length (P = .018). All patients with LQTc carried at least one risk factor for it other than the use of psychotropic medication(s), 3 of 4 patients had a combination therapy, all patients were prescribed SSRIs, and 2 of them had comorbid conditions. There is a high prevalence of psychotropic drugs polytherapy, and it is clearly associated with LQTc. Citalopram, SSRIs, and TCAs prolong QTc interval. It is recommended to assess non-pharmacological factors for LQTc and, if necessary, to obtain an electrocardiogram before starting patients on psychotropic drugs known to prolong the QTc interval.",

The study aimed to determine health anxiety and resilience levels in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. This case-control study conducted in Central Anatolia Region, Turkey, included 180 participants (60 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome, 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 60 healthy subjects). Data were collected using the Brief Resilience Scale and Health Anxiety Scale. Pain intensity was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale. Resilience was significantly higher in healthy controls than in the fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis groups (P < .001). Resilience was also higher in the rheumatoid arthritis group than fibromyalgia syndrome (P < .001) group. Hypersensitivity to somatic symptoms and anxiety, negative results of diseases, and total scores of Health Anxiety Scale were significantly higher in the fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis groups than healthy controls (P < .001). Also, Health Anxiety Scale scores in the fibromyalgia syndrome group were higher than the rheumatoid arthritis group (P < .001). There was a very strong and negative correlation between the participants' resilience and health anxiety levels (r = -0.818, P < .001). The most important predictors of resilience were hypersensitivity to somatic symptoms and anxiety (r = -0.335, P < .001), the group (r = 0.302, P = .003), the pain intensity (r = -0.169, P = .043), and the negative consequences of the disease (r = -.149, P = .038). The hypersensitivity to somatic symptoms and anxiety, the Visual Analog Scale, and the negative consequences of the disease were negatively correlated with resilience. But there was a positive correlation between fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis groups and resilience. Patients with fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis have low resilience and high health anxiety. The interventions should be planned to increase resilience and decrease the health anxiety of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis.",

Neuroscience, particularly psychiatry, is one of the domains that could potentially benefit from artificial intelligence and machine learning. This study aims to predict Stress and assess Coping with stress mechanisms during the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, help establish a successful intervention to manage distress. COVIDiSTRESS global survey data was used in this study and comprised 70 652 respondents after pre-processing. Binary classification is performed for predicting Stress and Coping with stress, while 2 ensemble machine learning algorithms, deep super learner and cascade deep forest, and state-of-the-art methods are explored for classification. Correlation attribute evaluation is used for feature significance. Statistical analysis, such as Cronbach's alpha, demographic statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, independent sample t-test, and 95% CI, is also performed. Globally, females, the younger population, and those in COVID-19 risk groups are observed to possess higher levels of stress. Trust, Loneliness, and Distress are found to be the primary predictors of Stress, whereas the significant predictors for coping with stress are identified as Social Provision, Extroversion, and Agreeableness. Deep super learner and cascade deep forest outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of up to 88.42%. By comparing different classifiers, we can conclude that multi-layer ensemble outperforms all. Another aim of this study, is the ability to regulate demographic and negative psychological states with a goal of medical interventions and to work towards building multiple coping strategies to reduce stress and promote resilience and recovery from COVID-19.",

The standard stress management group showed a reduction in anxiety score only (P = .002), whereas no significant changes were observed in the wait-list group. For positive emotion, all 3 groups showed significant improvement. Short-term virtual reality exposure therapy is a feasible intervention for the negative and positive emotions; however, cautious interpretation is needed due to significant heterogeneous sample.

Cronbach’s alpha vs. Spearman-Brown reliability analyses were done. Results: Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the CPDI was found to be 0.842, which is quite high. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the subscales ranged from 0.670 to 0.780. The Spearman-Brown reliability coefficient was 0.730. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed good fit indices (χ2/df = 1.94;root mean square error of approximation = 0.05;Comparative Fit Index = 0.93;Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index and Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.91). The mean total score was 27.26 (SD = 12.28), while the mean subscale scores ranged from 4.83 to 10.26. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the CPDI is valid and reliable, and can be used in studies evaluating the COVID-19 peritraumatic stress.",

Methods: A total of 1590 individuals participated, 63% (n = 1002) were females, 88% (n = 1399) self-identified as straight, and all replied to the anxiety subscale of the Brief Symptoms Inventory-18, the Fear of COVID-19, and the COVID-19 Negative Impact scales. Results: Anxiety symptomatology negatively associated with age and positively associated with coronavirus disease-aggravated replies, Fear of COVID-19, and Negative Impact of COVID-19. Hierarchical linear regression examination revealed that age, gender, and sexual orientation explained 8% of the variance of anxiety symptoms, and together with the Fear and the Negative Impact of COVID-19, it explained 28% of the results. Conclusion: Perceived anxiety symptoms were higher than anticipated and aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic: female and bisexual participants showed higher levels of anxiety symptomatology compared to male and straight, and gay or lesbian participants. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

This study included 28 male patients diagnosed with OUD according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria who received inpatient rehabilitation. The control group included 28 healthy male volunteers with characteristics similar to the patient group. Plasma leptin, acyl ghrelin, and unacylated ghrelin levels of the patients were measured 3 times throughout the study by collecting blood on the first day, the seventh day at the end of the detox, and the twenty-first day. Blood was collected only once from the control group to determine their plasma leptin, acyl ghrelin, and unacylated ghrelin levels. Our study did not determine any statistically significant differences between patients with OUD and healthy controls with regard to plasma leptin, acyl ghrelin, and unacylated ghrelin levels on the first, seventh, and twenty-first days of withdrawal. Plasma levels of leptin, acyl ghrelin, and unacylated ghrelin did not significantly correlate with craving scores. This study does not support the hypothesis that plasma leptin, acyl ghrelin, and unacylated ghrelin levels are markers in those with OUD. Further research, particularly in humans, is recommended to replicate and expand on the findings of the current literature.",

    "abstract": "Long-term social distancing, isolation, and economic fallout may be significant psychological triggers during pandemic, such as COVID-19, especially for those with underlying psychiatric illness. This study was conducted to address the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among patients with depression based at a teaching hospital in Malaysia. This is a cross-sectional online study among patients with depression from University Malaya Medical Centre, using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment (MADRS-S), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP), and Social Media Addiction during COVID-19 Pandemic (SMACOP). One hundred seventy-eight patients participated in this study. The mean total of the KAP score is 12.65 (SD = 2.65), with knowledge section (mean = 7.34 [SD = 2.13]), attitudes section (mean = 2.63 [SD = 0.58]), and practices section (mean = 2.69 [SD = 1.00]). They scored moderately on the MADRS-S (mean = 21.03 [SD = 4.62]) and ISI (mean = 20.25 [SD = 4.62]) but had high GAD-7 scores (mean = 16.8 (SD = 6.27]). From the multiple logistic regression analyses, depressive symptoms of greater severity (MADRS-S 18-34) are significantly associated with more severe insomnia (P < .001, adjusted OR = 9.101, 95% CI: 3.613-22.924). Furthermore, the high anxiety level is associated with the younger age group (P = .029, Adjusted OR = 2.274, 95% CI: 1.090-4.746), greater severity of insomnia (P < .001, Adjusted OR = 22.9, 95% CI: 6.145-85.343), and higher risk of COVID-19 related social media addiction (P = .011, adjusted OR = 2.637, 95% CI: 1.253-5.550). This study demonstrates the high levels of sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms experienced by outpatients with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are closely linked to the younger age group and at-risk social media addiction related to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to test the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test for children in the 5-9 age group and to determine the psychometric attributes of this tool. Intelligence is a complex and abstract concept. Therefore, it is not possible to observe or measure directly. However, it helps experts to have an idea about the intelligence levels of people with the evaluation scales used. Nonverbal ability tests are also one of the assessment scale types used for this purpose. The study was conducted based on the general survey model. One district from each socioeconomic development region was selected via random assignment taking as a basis the socioeconomic development listing for the districts. The study was carried out with 753 children from 4 different socioeconomic development regions. Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-3, Colored Progressive Matrices Test, and Denver II Developmental Screening Test were used for data collection. Cronbach Alpha reliability, test-retest reliability, and parallel form reliability were calculated during Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test reliability analyses. For validity analysis, the level of correlation between Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test and Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-3 and Colored Progressive Matrices Test tests was examined. It was determined that Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test has high reliability with an average reliability coefficient of .88. High correlation was observed between the A and B forms of Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test A (r = 0.93, P < .001) and during the test-retest analyses (0.87, 0.88). A statistically significant difference was determined between the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test scores and class level and age group, while a statistically significant difference could not be determined based on gender. A high, positive, and statistically significant correlation was determined between Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test and Colored Progressive Matrices Test (r = 0.84, P < .001), whereas a moderate, positive, and statistically significant correlation was determined between Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test and Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-3 (r = 0.52, P < .001). The findings illustrate that Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test is a valid and reliable intelligence test for measuring general intellectual ability and for assessing reasoning skills.",

This study aimed to investigate the expression of serum uric acid in alcohol-dependent patients and evaluate its clinical diagnostic value for cognitive impairment. Blood sample was collected for assessment of serum uric acid levels. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale scores were obtained to assess cognitive function. Anxiety and depression scores on the Symptom Check List 90 scale were used to assess mental health status. The alcohol-dependent patients were divided into non-cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment groups according to Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score, and the serum uric acid levels of these groups were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve evaluated the diagnostic value of serum uric acid in cognitive impairment patients. Pearson correlation coefficient evaluated the correlation between uric acid and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score, anxiety score, and depression score. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed the association between each index and cognitive impairment in patients. Serum uric acid was higher in patients than in controls (P < .001). Uric acid was significantly increased in cognitive impairment patients than in non-cognitive impairment patients (P < .001). Serum uric acid has certain diagnostic value in patients with cognitive impairment. Anxiety score and depression score were positively correlated with uric acid level, while Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score was negatively correlated with uric acid. Additionally, serum uric acid, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score, and anxiety and depression scores were the risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients (P < .05). The abnormal expression of uric acid has a high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing cognitive impairment from non-cognitive impairment.",

Psychological liability to depression and anxiety influences the disease process, prognosis, and treatment outcomes of other medical conditions. Early detection and treatment of these psychiatric conditions would also help in improving the physical functioning of patients with axial spondyloarthritis by reducing the patient's anxiety and depression symptoms. We evaluated the affective temperamental features, automatic thoughts, symptom interpretation, and their relationship with disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis. A total of 152 patients diagnosed with axial spondyloarthritis are recruited. Axial spondyloarthritis disease activity was calculated by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. Depression and anxiety levels were screened with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale while affective temperament was evaluated with Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-autoquestionnaire version and automatic thoughts were screened with Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire, and Automatic thoughts questionnaire. It was observed that 48% (n = 73) were female. The mean age was 43.5 (10.5) years, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index score was 3.97 (1.14). According to the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index scale, 53.30% (n = 81) of the patients were in high disease activity. We found that HAD-depression, HAD-anxiety, Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-autoquestionnaire version, Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire, and Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire scores were significantly higher in the high disease activity group. Patients' temperament characteristics and mood disorders may affect composite disease activity scores such as Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. In patients with high disease activity scores despite receiving appropriate treatment, mood disorders may need to be evaluated. There is a need to develop disease activity scores unaffected by mood disorders.",

The present study aimed to examine the perspectives and awareness of psychiatrists regarding suicidal behavior in individuals with ASD. To achieve this, an online survey was developed to assess clinicians' practices in evaluating suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals with ASD. A total of 143 psychiatrists, including 55 general adult psychiatrists and 88 child and adolescent psychiatrists, completed the cross-sectional survey. The results of the study revealed that clinicians reported lower rates of suicidal ideation and behavior in individuals with ASD compared to those without ASD (P < .05). Furthermore, it was found that the usage of screening tools for assessing suicidal behavior was significantly lower in the ASD group (P < .05). The study aimed to investigate psychiatrists' knowledge and screening practices regarding ASD and emphasize the importance of increasing knowledge and implementing effective screening and intervention practices to address the risk of suicidality in individuals with ASD.",

    "abstract": "Several theoretical and clinical observations lead to the hypothesis that pathological narcissism could be associated with suicide ideation due to the difficulty in regulating shame in a functional way. The present study investigated the roles of guilt, shame and rivalry in the relationship between pathological narcissism and suicidal ideation. A set of self-report questionnaires was completed by a sample of 936 Italian adults. These included the Italian version of the Guilt and Shame Proneness (GASP) scale, the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and the Narcissism Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire. A structural equation model that tested the factorial structure of the GASP and its invariance produced satisfactory results. Moreover, shame was a significant factor in the relationship between narcissism grandiosity and suicidal ideation. However, beta regression coefficients were low. These findings suggest that despite clinicians should consider the presence of suicidal ideation in patients with pathological narcissism and their maladaptive regulation of shame, the relationship between these variables is complex and deserve further investigation.",

    "abstract": "To explore the effects of Beck's cognitive therapy on the anxiety of patients after breast reconstruction. This study retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 150 patients with breast cancer undergoing breast reconstruction from June 2020 to June 2021 in our hospital, excluded 5 patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria, divided the remaining cases into an experimental group (EG, n = 70, perioperative routine management + Beck's cognitive therapy intervention) and a reference group (RG, n = 75, perioperative routine management) in accordance with different perioperative intervention programs, and compared the emotions of anxiety and depression, sense of social disability, and prognosis quality in both groups. At 2 months after surgery (T2) and 3 months after surgery (T3), EG had overtly lower Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores than RG (P < .05), with no difference in HAMA and BDI scores at 3 days before surgery (T0) and 1 month after surgery (T1) (P > .05). At the T0 stage, both groups were diagnosed as having a social disability, with no overt difference (P > .05). At T1 stage, The Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) scores in both groups increased remarkably and fell back at the T2 and T3 stages. At T1-T2 stages, SDSS scores of EG were significantly different from those of RG (P < .05), with no significant difference at T3 stage (P > .05). The excellent rate of prognosis in EG was 78.57% (55/70), higher than 77.33% (58/75) in RG, with no statistical difference in both groups (P < .05). The implementation of Beck's cognitive therapy in patients with breast reconstruction effectively improves adverse emotions in patients, which is of great significance for promoting postoperative rehabilitation and is an effective intervention program in the perioperative period.",

A retrospective cohort study was conducted to select patients with PlH diagnosed from July 2020 to July 2023 from Affiliated Hospital of Electronic Science and Technology University and Chengdu Women' s and Children's Central Hospital in Chengdu of Sichuan Province. The changes in blood pressure, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) in patients with hypertensive pregnancy were collected and analyzed. In our investigation, 219 patients completed the study, and 36.1% (79/219) of them developed anxiety and depression. According to whether the patients were treated with magnesium sulfate and labetalol, 49 cases were assigned to the magnesium sulfate and labetalol treatment (MSLT) group, and 30 cases were assigned to the conventional treatment (CT) group. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores and GAD-7 scores in the MSLT group were significantly lower than those in the CT group, indicating that magnesium sulfate and labetalol can improve anxiety and depression in hypertensive patients during pregnancy. The difference was statistically significant (P < .05). According to the changes in systolic blood pressure, the clinical efficacy of patients was evaluated, and no significant difference in efficacy existed between the MSLT and CT groups. Magnesium sulfate and labetalol can control the blood pressure of patients with PIH and indirectly improve anxiety and depression in patients with PIH, thereby introducing new ideas for the treatment of PIH accompanied by anxiety and depression.",

The Anxiety Sensitivity Index 3 (ASI-3) is a self-report scale for anxiety sensitivity. This study aims to resolve the ongoing controversy about the factorial structure of the ASI-3 using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), a newly advanced technique. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), ESEM, bifactor-CFA, and bifactor-ESEM were used to investigate the factorial structure of the ASI-3. Three hundred Korean college students (female = 195, age: 21.74 ± 2.34) filled out the ASI-3 and the Distress Intolerance Index. The bifactor-ESEM model exhibited a model fit superior to the 4 alternative models. The general factor showed higher loadings and reliability and explained common variance than the 3 specific factors in the bifactor-ESEM model. Most items reflected the global factor, but 6 items (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 17) from the specific factors had insufficient loadings. Moreover, the global factor of the ASI-3 was associated with distress intolerance scores, indicating adequate criterion-related validity. The factorial structure of the ASI-3 is best described as a bifactor-ESEM model for Korean college students. Additionally, the bifactor-ESEM model of the ASI-3 includes a strong global factor that explains a large amount of the observed variance in the ASI-3 items.",

    "abstract": "This study pursued a meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive accuracy of machine learning (ML) models in determining disorders of consciousness (DOC) among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify ML applications in the establishment of a predictive model of DOC after TBI as of August 6, 2023. Two independent reviewers assessed publication eligibility based on predefined criteria. The predictive accuracy was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Subsequently, a random-effects model was employed to estimate the overall effect size, and statistical heterogeneity was determined based on I2 statistic. Additionally, funnel plot asymmetry was employed to examine publication bias. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed based on age, ML type, and relevant clinical outcomes. Final analyses incorporated a total of 46 studies. Both the overall and subgroup analyses exhibited considerable statistical heterogeneity. Machine learning predictions for DOC in TBI yielded an overall pooled AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.82-0.84). Subgroup analysis based on age revealed that the ML model in pediatric patients yielded an overall combined AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80-0.95); among the model subgroups, logistic regression was the most frequently employed, with an overall pooled AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87). In the clinical outcome subgroup analysis, the overall pooled AUC for distinguishing between consciousness recovery and consciousness disorders was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.85). The findings of this meta-analysis demonstrated outstanding accuracy of ML models in predicting DOC among patients with brain injuries, which presented substantial research value and potential of ML application in this domain.",

Quality mental health service delivery at the primary level hinges on identifying and addressing related questions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the issues and solution proposals regarding service delivery based on the experiences of primary care workers in managing mental illnesses. This research was conducted using the focus group interview method, which is one of many qualitative research techniques. The study sample consisted of 8 physicians and 9 healthcare workers providing primary healthcare (PHC) services in a city. The data collection process was carried out using a semi-structured interview form and a personal information form. The interviews were recorded and later transcribed. Subsequently, main themes and subthemes were identified through content analysis and a detailed content analysis was conducted based on these themes. Themes from interviews with PHC workers included education/training needs, service delivery barriers, and recommendations. The study revealed that PHC workers lack current knowledge on mental illnesses. There was fear of stigma regarding mental illness within the community. Workers experienced systemic issues such as heavy workloads, inadequate physical space, and inability to access data. To reduce the treatment gap in primary mental health services and enhance access to high-quality mental health care, it would be beneficial to regularly update healthcare personnel training in mental health and increase public mental health literacy to prevent stigma and promote help-seeking behavior.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that the combination of antipsychotics and Pingxin Dingzhi Decoction (PXDZD) can effectively enhance treatment efficacy for schizophrenia (SCZ), while simultaneously reducing the adverse reactions associated with antipsychotic treatment. However, the exact mechanism by which PXDZD exerts its therapeutic effects is still unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the action mechanism of PXDZD using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. The primary components and their protein targets of PXDZD were extracted from TCMSP, SYMMAP, and HERB databases. The targets related to SCZ were acquired from OMIM and DisGeNET databases. The overlapping targets between composite targets and disease targets were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in the STRING database. The identified targets underwent GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, followed by molecular docking studies of the core target proteins and active compounds. The screening process yielded 285 PXDZD component targets and 1982 disease targets, ultimately leading to the identification of 120 shared targets. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that PXDZD treatment for SCZ engages a diverse range of biological mechanisms, including inflammatory responses and apoptotic processes, while also modulating various signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways. The molecular docking results revealed a strong affinity of Estrogen Receptor 1 (ER1) toward both β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, while kaempferol, β-sitosterol, and stigmasterol demonstrated significant binding potential against TNF-α. Pingxin Dingzhi Decoction can play a role in treating SCZ through its multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway approach.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in narcissistic personality traits and empathy deficits in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after pharmacotherapy, focusing on psychostimulant treatment. Understanding these comorbidities is crucial for optimizing treatment and improving therapeutic outcomes. This cross-sectional cohort study consisted of 75 randomly selected ADHD patients. The patients were started on methylphenidate or atomoxetine as per the indications for treatment. A Sociodemographic Data Form, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), and Empathy Quotient (EQ) were applied. Based on the study design, Adult ASRS, PNI and EQ were re-administered to the patients at the end of 3 months of treatment. The levels of pathological narcissism and empathy in patients were assessed before and after treatment. The median and minimum-maximum in PNI grandiosity score decreased significantly from 67.00 (30-108) before treatment to 60.00 (24-102) after treatment (P < .001). The mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) PNI Vulnerability score decreased statistically significantly from 63.83 ± 26.02 before treatment to 60.06 ± 24.64 after treatment (P = .003). The median and minimum-maximum in PNI total score was 134.50 (64-208) pre-treatment, which showed a statistically significant decrease after treatment (P < .001). The mean ± SD EQ score decreased statistically significantly from 33.86 ± 7.03 before treatment to 36.53 ± 7.55 after treatment (P = .001). Psychostimulant treatment in adult ADHD patients can ameliorate narcissistic traits and enhance empathy, thereby improving social functioning and interpersonal relationships. These findings suggest that psychostimulants may positively modulate neural circuits involved in narcissism and empathy, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychological disorder in patients with stroke. It not only seriously affects the patient's functional recovery, quality of life, and ability to return to society but also increases stroke recurrence rate and mortality. However, the effectiveness of drug treatment is unpredictable and associated with certain side effects and low compliance. Pharmacological therapy is limited. The field of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has recently made great progress in developing specific stimulation protocols to alleviate the symptoms of patients with PSD and might offer valid, alternative strategies. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for investigating the use of NIBS in the treatment of PSD. The methodological quality of selected studies was assessed according to the Risk of Bias 2 (ROB2). We identified 814 references in 3 databases. After excluding irrelevant and duplicate studies, 14 studies were included. According to the PRISMA checklist, 4 studies were overall comprehensive, 6 had some problems, and 4 had considerable problems with the presented information. The evidence was evaluated using ROB2, with 5 \"low-risk\" studies, 5 \"some concerns\" studies, and 4 \"high-risk\" studies included. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical trials reported in PSD. Noninvasive brain stimulation is a potentially promising treatment strategy. However, an optimal stimulation protocol needs to be formulated, and much work is required before NIBS can be widely applied in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "The objective is to investigate the situation and risk factors of depression in aged, hospitalized patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). A total of 196 aged CHF patients admitted to Xuanwu Hospital from May 2022 to March 2024 were consecutively selected. Information such as demographics, comorbidities, old-age hospitalization assessment results, and admission test results was collected. Differences were found between the patients admitted with CHF and depression and those without depression. Independent predictors of depression in aged, hospitalized patients with CHF were identified using logistic regression analyses. The sensitivity and specificity of age, frailty score, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification to evaluate the occurrence of depression were examined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Increased age [OR (Odds Ratio) = 1.132, (95% CI [Confidence Interval], 1.050-1.221), P = .001], higher frailty score [OR = 8.324, (95% CI, 4.233-16.368), P < .001], and higher NYHA classification [OR = 3.806, (95% CI, 1.864-7.773), P < .001] were independent predictors of depression in aged CHF hospitalized patients. The best indicators for the occurrence of depressive symptoms were age of 75 years, a score of 2 for frailty, and an NYHA classification of III. The AUCs for age, frailty score, and NYHA classification were 0.764, 0.876, and 0.707, respectively. Clinical assessment of depression is necessary for aged, hospitalized CHF patients. Patients over 75 years old, with a frailty score of at least 2, and an NYHA classification of III or IV are more prone to depression, which requires attention.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between parental smartphone addiction and preschool children's emotional regulation. A total of 818 preschool children, aged between 3 and 6 years, and their fathers and mothers were included in the study. Data were collected using the Chinese version of the Emotional Regulation Checklist and the Chinese version of the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. SPSS v. 20.0 was used to conduct descriptive statistical analysis, independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, and correlation analysis. Mplus v. 7.11 was used to conduct structural equation model analysis. Girls' emotional regulation was significantly stronger than boys' (P = .037). The emotional regulation of preschool children in the older class was significantly stronger than that of preschool children in the intermediate class and primary class (P = .045). There was no significant difference in emotional regulation between intermediate class children and primary class children (P = .213). Fathers' smartphone addiction (FSA) and mothers' smartphone addiction (MSA) were significant negative predictors of preschool children's emotional regulation (β MSA = -0.541, β FSA = -0.250). Mothers' smartphone addiction had a significantly stronger predictive effect on preschool children's emotional regulation than fathers' smartphone addiction. This study adds to previous research on parental smartphone addiction and preschool children's emotional regulation. The findings suggest that it is necessary to consider parental smartphone addiction, especially mothers' smartphone addiction, when developing intervention programs to enhance preschool children's emotional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Patients with depression often experience cognitive impairments. Cognitive rehabilitation, as an adjunctive intervention, may help to improve symptoms and restore functions in these patients. This study explores the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in improving symptoms and restoring cognitive functions in patients with depression. The following databases were systematically searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs): PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Two reviewers independently screened the studies. The search was conducted from the inception of the databases to April 10, 2024. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs, confidence interval were calculated using RevMan v. 5.3 software, and heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic. A total of 14 RCTs involving 700 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, there was no significant difference in the severity of depression after cognitive rehabilitation intervention, with a pooled SMD of -0.14 (95% CI: -0.32 to 0.05; P = .15; I2 = 30%). Among the 4 studies reporting attention-related data, cognitive rehabilitation significantly improved attention function in patients with depression compared with the control group, with an SMD of -0.63 (95% CI: -0.99 to -0.27; P < .001; I2 = 0%). In 6 studies, data showed significant improvement in verbal learning ability in patients with depression after cognitive rehabilitation intervention, with an SMD of -0.33 (95% CI: -0.60 to -0.05; P = .02; I2 = 48%). Executive function outcomes were reported in 6 studies, whereas working memory outcomes were reported in 7 studies, both before and after the intervention. No significant differences were observed between the groups, with SMDs of -0.45 (95% CI: -1.09 to 0.19; P = .17; I2 = 78%) in executive function and -0.38 (95% CI: -0.82 to 0.07; P = .10; I2 = 67%) in working memory post-intervention. Subgroup analysis suggested that cognitive rehabilitation training had a close to statistically significant improvement effect on depression severity in European regions, whereas no significant impact was observed in other regions. Cognitive rehabilitation shows certain value in improving attention and verbal learning in patients with depression as an adjunctive treatment, but its effectiveness in improving depressive symptoms, executive function, and working memory remains inconclusive. Future large-sample RCTs are needed to further explore this aspect.",

The sample of this study consists of 384 individuals (71.91% of them were female, 28.09% of them were male) living in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and having a partner. The sociodemographic information form and Perspectives of Love and Sex Scale were used. Statistical Package for Social Sciences 21.0 and AMOS 21.0 software have been used in the statistical analysis of the research data. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test, Bartlett's sphericity test, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha test, Spearman's correlation test, and item-total correlations have been examined within the scope of the validity-reliability study of the scale. The significance level in the research is the type I error rate (α = 0.05). The exploratory factor analysis revealed that the total explained variance is 57.08%. Items 2 and 13 were excluded from the 4-factor and 17-item scale settled by exploratory factor analysis because their factor loads were not appropriate and they disrupted the model fit. When the Cronbach's alpha test results of the scale are examined, it has been settled that it was 0.702 for the \"love is most important\" subdimension, 0.861 for the \"sex demonstrates love\" subdimension, 0.763 for the \"love comes before sex\" subdimension, and 0.760 for the \"sex is declining\" subdimension. Consequently, Perceptions of Love and Sex Scale is determined to be a valid and reliable measurement tool.",

This cross-sectional survey comprised 301 comorbid patients. Three binary logistic regression models were used to investigate the factors linked to AUDs in patients with schizophrenia. Propensity score matching analysis was conducted to validate inconsistent variables identified by the regression models. Significant differences were observed between the comorbid and non-comorbid groups concerning sex (P < .001), disposition (P = .049), smoking habits (P < .001), place of residence (P = .010), family relationships (P = .002), family history of mental disorders (P = .008), history of alcoholism (P = .003), onset latency (P = .005), impulsivity (P < .001), suicide or self-injury history (P < .001), and obvious aggressive behavior (P < .001) in univariate analyses. The area under the curve values for the three regression models were 0.83 (P < .001), 0.80 (P < .001), and 0.81 (P < .001), respectively. Binary logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses indicated that introverted disposition, smoking, acute onset, impulsivity, and suicide or self-injury history were independent risk factors associated with AUDs in inpatients with schizophrenia with an odds ratio of > 1. Introverted disposition, smoking, acute onset, impulsivity, and suicide or self-injury history were independently associated with the AUDs in inpatients with schizophrenia.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and VIP database. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in articles using the Cochrane collaboration's tool, with analysis performed via RevMan software. After reviewing major databases, 13 studies were included. Three studies assessed prenatal depression and vitamin D levels, showing significantly lower levels in the depression group compared to controls (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] = -0.41, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] -0.57 to -0.25) with minimal heterogeneity, thus a fixed effects model was used. Another three studies explored postpartum depression and vitamin D, revealing considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 96%, P < .01), leading to the use of a random effects model; these indicated much lower vitamin D levels in the depression group (SMD = -1.62, 95% CI -2.62 to -0.62). Seven studies examined the link between postpartum depression and vitamin D deficiency, again showing significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 92%, P < .01) and lower vitamin D levels in depressed women (SMD [Standardized Mean Difference] = 2.28, 95% CI 1.60-3.25), with no significant publication bias detected. Reduced vitamin D levels are significantly associated with the incidence of perinatal depression. Pregnant women with reduced vitamin D levels have a relatively higher risk of depression. This signifies that vitamin D levels may figure prominently in maintaining maternal mental health.",

The impact of addiction places increased economic and medical burdens on society. Currently, the management of addiction is more focused on symptomatic relief rather than targeting the reinforcing mechanisms of dependence on addictive substances and behaviors. The aim of this review is to identify the specific roles of dopamine and glutamate in addiction, which can guide us to treat the cause rather than the symptoms. The synergistic effect of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitters plays a crucial role in the development of pathological neuroplasticity in the mesolimbic system, causing compulsive consumption of the substance. Utilizing the brain's natural synthesis of substances such as Kynurenic acid (KYNA) derivatives could potentially disrupt the synergistic effect of glutamate and dopamine. By blocking glutamate release and increasing dopamine release, individuals may experience reward or pleasure without the need for addictive substances. Under this pretext, the review article explores the possibility of memantine and galantamine as maintenance treatment for addiction of various forms.",

We aimed to research the comorbid psychiatric disorders and alexithymia and to identify whether alexithymia and accompanying somatic symptoms predict the presence of psychiatric diagnoses or not among HBsAg carriers. healthy carriers of Hepatitis B patients and nınety-three healthy individuals were included to study. Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) (SCID-I), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) were applied. When the distribution of SCID I psychiatric diagnoses among healthy HBsAg carriers examined, majority of the patients (n = 53, 59.6%) had any psychiatric diagnosis. The logistic regression model evaluating whether number of somatic symptoms and alexithymia predict the psychiatric diagnosis, we observed that number of somatic symptoms predicted the presence of psychiatric diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.762, P < .001). Our findings revealed that alexithymia may potentiate the occurrence of psychiatric disorders in such patients and that it requires more consideration. So, our results suggest that HBsAg carriers need multidisciplinary evaluation including hepatology, infection clinics and psychiatric liaison.",

    "abstract": "Although hypertension is the most important cardiovascular risk factor, we still do not understand all the factors that contribute to the disease onset. The aim of this study was to examine the association between personality dimensions and primary hypertension. In total, 310 participants were recruited in a case-control design. The association of personality dimensions with primary hypertension was examined in normotensive (n = 156) and hypertensive (n = 120) patients following assessment of the 5 personality dimensions with the DECAS Personality Inventory. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess the predictive value of personality traits for hypertension, controlling for recognized confounders such as age, gender, obesity, smoking history, parental history of hypertension, and education. Low or very low emotional stability was almost twice as frequent in the hypertensive group (71.7%) as in the normotensive study population (43.5%). The binary logistic regression model showed that low emotional stability is a significant predictor for hypertension, the risk of being hypertensive decreasing by 7% with each point increase on the emotional stability score. Very low or low emotional stability increased the odds of being hypertensive by 3.55 times (odds ratio: 3.55, 95% CI: 2.18-9.35, P < .001). No association between the severity of hypertension and personality traits was found. People with low emotional stability/high neuroticism have more than 3-fold increased odds of developing primary hypertension. The assessment of personality traits could be used as a tool to identify individuals at risk to develop primary hypertension as well as patients with primary hypertension where psychotherapy could be of potential value. This study highlights the need for further research, in order to establish effective, patient-oriented prevention strategies and treatment options.",

It was recently reported that symptoms of anxiety and depression are frequent in patients with DMD, and psychosocial support is important for their quality of life. We reported 3 patients (2 patients with DMD and 1 patient with muscular dystrophy of an unknown etiology) with panic disorder and treated them successfully with neurofeedback (NFB). The NFB protocols were slow motor rhythm at T4 for 2 patients, beta training at F3 for 1 patient, and alpha/theta training at Pz for all patients. All patients had significantly improved anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks, after NFB therapy. NFB can be considered a safe therapeutic alternative without causing even minor side effects and without drug interactions for DMD patients with panic or anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "The fascinating paper by Bai and colleagues published on Alpha Psychiatry has attracted our attention, as this is a neglected topic but, in our opinion, of utmost importance in psychiatry.They demonstrated that cognitive impairment triggered by alcohol dependence was strictly related to increased serum uric acid (UA) levels in alcohol-dependent patients.Moreover, the impairment of the nervous system caused by the high levels of serum UA may be the central origin of cognitive impairment, also associated with a more considerable risk of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric symptoms.These results are remarkable and unsurprising as UA may be involved in severe psychiatric disorders and substance abuse alone or in comorbidity.UA is the terminal product resulting from the graduation of purines, and these (adenine and guanine) are nitrogenous bases, which make up the DNA in the nucleus of animal and plant cells. 1 As the body is made up of many cells constantly being renewed, a large proportion of purines come from endogenous synthesis.At the same time, only a tiny percentage derives from dietary intake. 1 UA circulates in the blood partly free and partly bound to transport proteins: the organ responsible for its removal is the kidney, which eliminates about 450 mg of it with the urine daily and another 200 mg through digestive secretions. 2 If UA is produced in excess or is not eliminated sufficiently, it can accumulate in the body and increase blood levels, causing hyperuricemia. 2 The uricemia test detects elevated levels of this compound and helps the doctor diagnose gout.This test also monitors uric acid levels during specific therapies and analyses the causes of recurrent kidney stone formation.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric evaluations consist of both qualitative questions and quantitative assessments, sometimes questioning the same issue. The present study attempts to investigate the statistical equivalency of several close-ended questions of a procedural psychiatric examination and rating scales addressing a similar problem.The current retrospective analysis included 314 patients who made their first visit to a private psychiatry clinic. Subjects underwent a routine psychiatric examination, including close-ended questions and related clinical scales. Questions included sleep and sexual problems, problems in marriage, parent relationship problems, and childhood abuse. The related psychiatric scales were Jenkins Sleep Scale, Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. First, receiver operating curve analysis was conducted for each yes/no question and clinical scale. Then, area under curve sensitivity and specificity values were calculated. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was also performed to observe paired predictor variables.Among clinical questionnaires, the receiver operating curve model provided good area under curve values as prediction criteria for Dyadic Adjustment Scale (0.78; P < .001), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (0.74; P < .001), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-physical abuse (0.826; P < .001), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-sexual abuse (0.828; P < .001), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (0.796; P < .001), and Jenkins Sleep Scale (0.920; P < .001). Multinomial logistic regression models also revealed good correct classification values for Dyadic Adjustment Scale-Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (61%), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Physical abuse-Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Sexual abuse (87.6%), and Arizona Sexual Experience Scale-Jenkins Sleep Scale (67%).When the symptoms are investigated in general terms, the present study reveals that an experienced clinician could rely on clinical questions as much as the quantitative scales in both clinical and research domains.",
