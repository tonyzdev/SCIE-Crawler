    "abstract": "We describe a new species of 'Markuelia' from the Middle Cambrian of Australia, a taxon based exclusively on embryonic specimens. The two likewise putatively embryonic specimens of the new species named 'Markuelia lauriei' sp. nov. have been discovered amongst material collected in 1986 in an area approximately 160 km south of Mt. Isa, Queensland, Australia. The specimens differ from the previously described species of 'Markuelia' not only in size (they are significantly smaller), but also in the presence of an abaxial row of four soft, slim, elongate, tubulous outgrowths dorsally in the anterior region with being more irregularly distributed all over the dorsal surface. The extremely fine preservation of the new specimens adds significantly to the known morphological variation within the taxon 'Markuelia'.",

    "abstract": "The word 'stromatolite' should only be applied to organosedimentary structures predominantly accreted by sediment trapping, binding and/or in situ precipitation as a result of the growth and metabolic activities of benthic, principally prokaryotic, micro-organisms. Structures of uncertain origin that resemble stromatolites should be called 'stromatoloids'. This cautious approach would eliminate the currently common assumption that structures with mesoscopic morphological similarities to microbially accreted sedimentary structures must be biogenic, a misconception that hampers investigations into the antiquity of life. A hierarchical series of meso- and microstructural attributes of stromatolites can be used to assign gradually increasing probabilities of biogenicity to stromatoloids. This method is particularly useful for interpreting ancient noncolumnar stromatoloids with poor microstructural preservation. In a range of Early Archaean pseudocolumnar, nodular and stratiform stromatoloids from North Pole studied using this method, none could be proved to be stromatolites and only a few are probable or possible stromatolites. As these stromatoloids closely resemble previously reported structures from North Pole interpreted as stromatolites, we consider that the evidence for the existence of life c. 3500 my ago at North Pole is less definitive than previously supposed.",

    "abstract": "Dickinsonia was a very thin (<3 mm) subcircular to elliptical worm that grew to about a metre in length. It appears to have been a common, conspicuous and widespread Late Precambrian animal. Dickinsonia probably had a hydrostatic skeleton (true coelom); metamerically arranged dorsoventral muscles; longitudinal, transverse and possibly diagonal muscles; an inextensible collagenous basement membrane; a well-developed circulatory system; and possibly a gut with lateral lobes. It was probably an annelid, but may have been neither a polychaete nor an oligochaete, and its geometry and ontogeny suggest that its similarity to the living discoidal polychaete Spinther is due to convergence. Calculations indicate that Dickinsonia could have respired in sea water containing about a tenth of the present amount of oxygen. Since it lived in well-aerated sublittoral environments, its peculiar shape may reflect the low level of oxygen in the Late Precambrian atmosphere. The geometry of coeval animals reinforces this view. Few, if any, Precambrian trace fossils can be attributed to the activities of sizeable animals burrowing by peristaltic movements of the body wall. The existence of Dickinsonia prior to the first clear evidence for peristaltic burrowing by macroscopic animals casts doubt on Clark's hypothesis that both body cavities and segmentation developed in response to the need for an efficient hydrostatic skeleton which was used for burrowing in soft substrates. It now seems possible that both structures first appeared in surface dwellers as a means for increasing body size. Only subsequently were both used as devices for invading soft substrates.",

These unusually diverse collections show that many different kinds of molluscs lived in the tropical Australian seas of the Middle Cambrian and provide new information on the way the molluscan classes Cephalopoda, Gastropoda, Rostro- conchia, and Pelecypoda evolved. In other sections, we discuss the problems of classifying and naming Cambrian molluscs; define a number of terms that can be used to describe shell form (including a new adjective, gyrogastric); reclassify the Class Monoplacophora after incorporating the helcionellacean and bellerophontacean \"gastropods\"; and outline the early record and history of the Mollusca. New taxa are: the Families Scenellidae (nom. transl. ex Scenellinae Wenz 1938) and Yochelcionellidae; the genera Eotebenna (Yochelcionellidae), Mellopegma (Procarinariidae), and ProtoweneHa (Multifariidae); and the species Helcionella terraustralis, Latouchella accordionata, L. merino, L. penecyrano, Yochelcionella daleki, Y. ostentata, Eotebenna pontifex, E. papilio, Mellopegma georginensis, Stenotheca tepee, S. pojetai, Protowenella flemingi, Pelagiella deltoides, P. corinthiana, and Myonai? queenslandica.",

The fructification consists of an infolded megasporophyll with loosely overlapping lateral margins forming an envelope bearing sessile gymnospermous seeds on the inner surface. The seeds contain a megagametophyte with one archegonium. Previous interpretations of fertile glossopterid structures as cupular valves, fertiligers, and cones with a subtending bract, e.g. Dictyopteridium and Scutum, are now reinterpreted as having a similar arrangement of megasporophyll envelope (= subtending bract of 'cone') enclosing the seeds. Pollen-bearing organs in the deposit are of the Arberiella type and contain bisaccate pollen. Similar pollen grains are found in the micropyles and pollen chambers of the seeds. Petrified fern leptosporangia are also common in the silicified material, but are not related to Glossopteris. Glossopteris, which was probably a deciduous aborescent gymnosperm, is considered to be a distinct type of pteridosperm.",

    "abstract": "As is widely recognised, fossil florules are difficult to correlate because they appear to have been more controlled by environmental and ecological factors than uniform changes which reflect the passage of geological time. Here I present a worked example of a generally applicable approach to this problem in dating and mapping fossil plant associations. Floral associations are best described and named by the classical methods of phytosociology. The three dimensional shape of an association in rocks and its palaeoecology can then be critically assessed. For example, during Middle Triassic time the following plant associations would have been encountered on a traverse from the coast to several hundred kilometres inland from the Pacific margin of Gondwanaland: Pachydermophylletum (mangrove scrub), Linguifolietum (coastal swamp woodland), Dicroidietum odontopteroidium (floodplain forest), Phoenicopsetum (levee bank scrub), Dicroidietum odontopteroidium xylopterosum (xerophytic woodland) and Johnstonietum (mallee-like woodland). The fourth dimension of fossil plant associations (time) is best assessed from the evolution of a prominent group of plants. In conjunction with the ranges of other plant megafossils, evolutionary changes can be used to define Oppel-zones. For the Late Permian to Early Jurassic of eastern Australasia, I have used the evolution of Dicroidium and leaves of related pteridosperm plants together with other species of restricted stratigraphic range or prominent in the definition of the fossil plant associations. From this evidence four Oppel-zones can be recognised. 'Thinnfeldia' callipteroides Oppel-zone (Chhidruan to Smithian, 250–230 × 106 years), Dicroidium zuberi Oppel-zone (Smithian to Middle Anisian, 230–220 × 106 years), D. odontopteroides Oppel-zone (Late Anisian to Ladinian, 220–210 × 106 years) and Yabeiella Oppel-zone (Carnian to Rhaetian, 210–200 × 106 years. In a complete revision of the pteridosperm form-genera Dicroidium, Johnstonia and Xylopteris, a large number of new combinations and the following new taxa are proposed; Dicroidium gouldii sp. nov., D. odontopteroides var. argenteum var. nov., D. odontopteroides var. moltenense var. nov., D. radiatum sp. nov., D. townrovii sp. nov. and Johnstonia coriacea var. obesa var. nov.",

    "abstract": "The global blitzkrieg hypothesis explains differential rates of megafaunal extinction between the world's landmasses in the late Quaternary based on a proposed leap in predation efficiency enjoyed by colonising societies. It is characterised by appealing simplicity. Selective over hunting, facilitated by naiveté to human predation, produced rapid mass extinctions of large animals wherever subsistence societies colonised new landmasses. Taken at face value the circumstantial case for blitzkrieg is compelling and despite a paucity of direct evidence it has gained considerable support. Our review of the model suggests that it overlooks much contradictory data and rests on simplistic interpretations of complex biogeographicat and anthropological phenomena. These interpretations and assumptions do not account for major differences between the biotas, ecologies and human cultures of the landmasses involved. The assertion that responses of remote island species to human predation provide realistic models for those of continental taxa is poorly founded, exaggerating the likely predation efficiency of humans colonising continents. An absence of terrestrial predators over evolutionarily significant periods, together with restricted ranges and small populations, renders island faunas uniquely vulnerable to invaders. The argument, that climate cannot explain these phenomena because previous Glacial Maxima did not cause comparable extinctions, presupposes that their local effects were at least as severe as those of the Last Glacial Maximum. This has yet to be demonstrated and at most it would indirectly support a role for anthropogenic influence, not overkill per se. Overlooked or underplayed are the influences of translocated and other invading species. Similarly, differences in the origins, technologies and traditions of colonising human societies are rarely considered. These factors strongly impact on the predation efficiency, density and range of human populations, critically affecting the outcomes of predator-prey modeling. When a fuller constellation of influences and constraints is considered it is reasonable to posit that rapid mass extinction through selective human predation may largely describe megafaunal extinctions on remote islands, but the argument is not convincing for continents. This is especially so regarding Australia. Because even the largest Australian species were prey to endemic carnivores, their responses to human predation would not have been comparable to those of oceanic island species. No kill-sites or specialized big-game hunting/butchering tools are known and, on the basis of ethnographic and archaeological data, it is probable that predation efficiency, population density and range of the first Australians were insufficient to effect rapid mass extinction. Chronologies of human arrival and the disappearance of megafauna remain poor, but the most recent estimates for human-megafaunal coexistence in Australia range from 10,000 to 43,000 years. Although human predation may have been a contributing factor in megafaunal extinctions, rapid overkill is unlikely to describe the actual mechanism in most instances. The role of human predation and its significance relative to competing factors, human and otherwise, varied considerably between landmasses, as did the speeds with which extinctions occurred. Blitzkrieg and other mono-factorial models are heuristically valuable devices, but a growing body of evidence suggests that extinction can rarely, if ever, be attributed to a single cause.",

We review the Victorian succession and incorporate other Australian and New Zealand graptolitic sequences into an Australasian set of zones and stages. Thirty zones are recognized and defined, of which one (Ca4, Isograptus victoriae maximodivergens) is new and two (La1, Da4) each comprise two subzones. Several zones are redefined, but the previous zone notation has been retained. Nine stages are recognized (as previously) and defined, six (Lancefieldian, Bendigonian, Chewtonian, Castlemainian, Yapeenian, Darriwilian) in the Early Ordovician and three (Gisbornian, Eastonian, Bolindian) in the Late Ordovician; reference sections for each are nominated. The Bolindian stage contains 5 zones, here designated Bol-5. The Australasian stages are correlated internationally. A census of Australasian graptolite taxa lists the currently recognized 313 species and subspecies, with references. A range chart shows the zonal distribution of all species, and reveals an average duration of 2·46 zones per species, approximately equivalent to 5 Ma. The pattern of diversity change shows maxima during the Bendigonian-Chewtonian (peaking in Be1 with 55 taxa), late Castlemainian-mid Darriwilian, and late Gisbornian-early Eastonian. Species originations peak in Be1 and Da3 and are high throughout much of the Late Ordovician. Extinctions peak in the Da3 and are high towards the end of the Ordovician.",

The pollen assemblages indicate rain-forest through most of the Tertiary, but the requisites for pollen preservation are biased towards the wetter climates. The present day geographical affinities of the botanical groups are largely with taxa of the tropical zone and Australia-wide taxa. There is geographic variation in the fossil pollen assemblages when southeastern Australia is compared with Central Australia and Queensland. The major changes in the fossil floras coincide with climatic change, indicating the influence of climate on the evolution of plant assemblages. The older phytogeographic concepts are inappropriate for the fossil record, especially when considered in conjunction with palaeoclimates and palaeogeography. It is unfortunate that palynology has given little information of the evolution of floras in drier climatic regimes, or of the evolution of the eucalypts.",

    "abstract": "A diverse assemblage of organic microfossils is preserved within stromatolitic cherts from 10 localities in the approximately 1500 m.y. old Balbirini Dolomite. The assemblage is dominated by coccoid blue-green algae referable to the Entophysalidaceae and the Chroococcaceae. There are a few oscillatoriacean and dermocarpacean or pleurocapsacean cyanophytes, and sporangia-like spheroids of uncertain affinities are abundant. A total of 14 genera including at least 25 species have been identified; however, at any particular locality, the species diversity is relatively low. Eoentophysalis belcherensis Hofmann is one of the most abundant organisms in the assemblage and appears to have formed the basically flat laminae of the stromatolites studied. These stromatolites seem analogous to modern examples of 'pustular mat.' Numerous degradational forms of E. belcherensis have been recognized. Cell-like units in this alga (probably remnants of sheaths) commonly are defined by opaque, possibly pyritic granules. These granules may have formed at sites in the sheaths where iron was chelated to a scytonemine-like pigment. Pyrite inclusions located within cells of Sphaerophycus reticulatum Muir appear to have formed at sites of coalesced organic matter. The algal mats in the Balbirini Dolomite grew in an arid, intertidal to supratidal habitat. Comparisons are made between the communities preserved at each locality and modern assemblages from different environmental zones in Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay. These comparisons are pertinent to palaeoenvironmental basin analyses. There is no firm evidence for the presence of eukaryotes in this biota, although 5 genera are of unclear affinities and could include prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic organisms. A fairly advanced state of the cyanophycean colonial habit is indicated by the organizational complexity exhibited by E. belcherensis, Myxomorpha janecekii Muir, and Myriasporella pyriformis gen. et sp. nov. The presence of numerous sporangia-like spheroids suggests that sporangial reproduction may have developed by middle Proterozoic time. E. belcherensis probably had a cosmopolitan distribution at least 1500 m.y. ago. The Balbirini microflora is comparable to those from the Amelia Dolomite (McArthur Group) and the approximately 2000 m.y. old Belcher Supergroup of Canada. It is likely that the predominance of Chroococcaceae and mat-forming Entophysalidaceae in all three assemblages reflects their similar depositional environments. Results of this study are applicable to the establishment of a biostratigraphic zonation of the McArthur Group and are consistent with the concept that the size distribution of unicells in Proterozoic microbiotas may be useful for intercontinental stratigraphic correlation. New taxa include 4 genera (Tetraphycus, Myriasporella, Balbiriniella, Pilavia) and 12 species (Chroococcaceae: Myxococcoides cracens; Chroococcaceae(?): Tetraphycus acinulus, T. diminutivus, T. gregalis, T. major; Dermocarpaceae or Pleurocapsaceae: Myriasporella pyriformis; Incertae Sedis: Balbiriniella praestans, Clonophycus biattina, C. ostiolum, C. refringens, C. vulgaris, Pilavia maculata).",

P. longicaulis probably lived in extensive monodominant stands in the interdistributary bays of the 'Gosford delta' system, bordering a large coastal lagoon or lake.

It is suggested that certain major groups of early vertebrates differentiated in isolation on these continental areas as freshwater environments were invaded, and the interrelationships of some agnathans and placoderms endemic to these areas are analyzed using the cladistic vicariance biogeographic method of Platnick & Nelson (1978). Two possible episodes of biotic dispersal are identified; between Laurentia and Baltica at the end of the Silurian, and between Gondwana and Euramerica during the Late Devonian. Amongst placoderm fishes a Gondwana origin is suggested for Phyllolepis, antiarchs indicate affinity between Gondwana and South China, and euarthrodires may have evolved in Euramerica.

Because the original aragonitic microstructures of molluscan shells are almost invariably destroyed by recrystallisation in rocks older than the Carboniferous, the discovery of replicated shell microstructures has provided a new understanding of the evolution of the molluscan shell. Most of the common molluscan microstructures — spherulitic prismatic aragonite, tangentially arranged fibrous aragonite, crossed-lamellar aragonite, nacre and foliated calcite — had probably appeared by at least the beginning of the Middle Cambrian, and most are found in representatives of the Class Monoplacophora. A simple biochemical model is used to explain the convergent evolution of nacreous and foliated structures from prismatic ones.",

Early Cretaceous polar biotas of Victoria, southeastern Australia—an overview of research to date. Alcheringa 42, 158–230. ISSN 0311-5518.Although Cretaceous fossils (coal excluded) from Victoria, Australia, were first reported in the 1850s, it was not until the 1950s that detailed studies of these fossils were undertaken. Numerous fossil localities have been identified in Victoria since the 1960s, including the Koonwarra Fossil Bed (Strzelecki Group) near Leongatha, the Dinosaur Cove and Eric the Red West sites (Otway Group) at Cape Otway, and the Flat Rocks site (Strzelecki Group) near Cape Paterson. Systematic exploration over the past five decades has resulted in the collection of thousands of fossils representing various plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Some of the best-preserved and most diverse Hauterivian–Barremian floral assemblages in Australia derive from outcrops of the lower Strzelecki Group in the Gippsland Basin. The slightly younger Koonwarra Fossil Bed (Aptian) is a Konservat-Lagerstätte that also preserves abundant plants, including one of the oldest known flowers. In addition, insects, crustaceans (including the only syncaridans known from Australia between the Triassic and the present), arachnids (including Australia’s only known opilione), the stratigraphically youngest xiphosurans from Australia, bryozoans, unionoid molluscs and a rich assemblage of actinopterygian fish are known from the Koonwarra Fossil Bed. The oldest known—and only Mesozoic—fossil feathers from the Australian continent constitute the only evidence for tetrapods at Koonwarra. By contrast, the Barremian–Aptian-aged deposits at the Flat Rocks site, and the Aptian–Albian-aged strata at the Dinosaur Cove and Eric the Red West sites, are all dominated by tetrapod fossils, with actinopterygians and dipnoans relatively rare. Small ornithopod (=basal neornithischian) dinosaurs are numerically common, known from four partial skeletons and a multitude of isolated bones. Aquatic meiolaniform turtles constitute another prominent faunal element, represented by numerous isolated bones and articulated carapaces and plastrons. More than 50 specimens—mostly lower jaws—evince a high diversity of mammals, including monotremes, a multituberculate and several enigmatic ausktribosphenids. Relatively minor components of these fossil assemblages are diverse theropods (including birds), rare ankylosaurs and ceratopsians, pterosaurs, non-marine plesiosaurs and a lepidosaur. In the older strata of the upper Strzelecki Group, temnospondyl amphibians—the youngest known worldwide—are a conspicuous component of the fauna, whereas crocodylomorphs appear to be present only in up-sequence deposits of the Otway Group. Invertebrates are uncommon, although decapod crustaceans and unionoid bivalves have been described. Collectively, the Early Cretaceous biota of Victoria provides insights into a unique Mesozoic high-latitude palaeoenvironment and elucidates both palaeoclimatic and palaeobiogeographic changes throughout more than 25 million years of geological time.Stephen F.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Oligocene vegetation at Pioneer was closed temperate rainforest dominated by Nothofagus johnstonii Hill, which probably produced N. menziesii-type pollen. However, other angiosperms (Quintinia, Cupaniae, Ilex, Cunoniaceae, Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Winteraceae) were also present, as well as several conifers (Athrotaxis, Phyllocladus, Podocarpus, Dacrydium, Dacrycarpus and Araucariaceae). This rainforest was floristically more complex that the modern Tasmanian Nothofagus cunninghamii rainforests but contained many taxonomically related elements. One major difference was that a fern similar to extant Cyathea filled the riparian niche now largely occupied by the tree-fern Dicksonia antarctica. There is indirect evidence that species producing Nothofagus brassii-type pollen may have occurred upstream of the site of deposition, suggesting that the Nothofagus species were altitudinally zoned or edaphically restricted. The current absence of many of these Nothofagus species in Tasmania may be due to their inability to survive the low temperatures of the Quaternary glaciations. The high degree of similarity of the Pioneer palynoflora to that recorded in Oligocene sediments in onshore (Partridge, 1971) and offshore (Stover & Partridge, 1973; Stover & Evans, 1973) Gippsland Basin strongly suggests that there was little regional differentation in southeastern Australia at that time.",

Trilete, cicatricose to canaliculate spores characteristic of extant Anemia are identified in fossil Anemia colwellensis Chandler, Anemia fremontii Knowlton forma fertilis Andrews, Pelletixia valdensis (Seward) Watson & Hill, Pelletixia amelguita Skog, and Russian specimens of Ruffordia goeppertii (Dunker) Seward; smooth-walled spores occur in Anemia poolensis Chandler. English Ruffordia goeppertii have spores that are morphologically intermediate between those of extant Anemia and Ceratopteris, but sporangial features confirm alliance with the Schizaeaceae. Sporangia are unknown from fossil Schizaeopsis americana Berry, and its spores are distinct from those of extant ferns. Distally annulate sporangia consistent with those of the Schizaeaceae occur in fossil Schizaeangium jurassicum Bohra & Sharma, Schizaeopteris mesozoica Stopes & Fuji and Mohriopsis plastica Appert, but spore morphology of these taxa awaits clarification and/or documentation. The fossil dispersed spore genus Cicatricosisporites Potonié & Gelletich (emended herein) accommodates spores consistent with those of Anemia (Anemia mexicana- and Anemia dregeana-types) and Mohria (Mohria-type). However, spores of the latter taxon have not been positively identified as fossils. Appendicisporites Weyland & Krieger emend. Burden & Hills, Plicatella Maljavkina emend. Burden & Hills, and Nodosisporites Deák (emended herein) are also diagnostic of Anemia-type spores, representing respectively the Anemia oblongifolia-, Anemia raddiana-, and Anemia phyllitidis-types. Magnastriatites Germeraad, Hopping, & Muller (emended herein) defines dispersed spores of the Ceratopteris-type. Two new genera, Ruffordiaspora and Fisciniasporites, are proposed for spores comparable to those in English Ruffordia goeppertii and Schizaeopsis americana respectively. Similarities of Mohria, Anemia, and Ruffordia are emphasized in a cladistic analysis which also indicates that Ceratopteris is more similar to these taxa than to other extant Schizaeaceae. The fossil record implies a common place (northern Gondwana-southern Laurasia) and time (Middle Jurassic) of origin of plants that shed Anemia- (A. mexicana-) and Ruffordia-type spores. Anemia spread to, and differentiated in, mid-high latitudes of Laurasia during the Late Jurassic, and by the Early Cretaceous had achieved near world-wide distribution. Thereafter, its distribution range progressively contracted to its now limited distribution in tropical America, Africa, and southern India. Plants with Ruffordia-type spores spread into both hemispheres in Late Jurassic times, and were concentrated in mid-high latitudes during the Early Cretaceous; extinction occurred by the close of the Cretaceous. Earliest traces of Ceratopteris are from the Eocene of India, and by the Oligocene the genus had pantropical distribution as it does today.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fossil remains of primitive vertebrates, preserved in sandstone as natural moulds of the dermal armour, are described from the shallow-water marine Stairway Sandstone of the Amadeus Basin, Northern Territory, Australia. This is the first record of Ordovician vertebrates in the southern hemisphere. Two new genera and species, Arandaspis prionotolepis gen. et sp. nov. and Porophoraspis crenulata gen. et sp. nov., are described. Arandaspis is the most completely preserved of any known Ordovician vertebrate. It is the type genus of the new family Arandaspididae, and is referred to the new order Arandaspidiformes. The new Australian genera are provisionally interpreted as heterostracans, a group of agnathans not previously recorded from Australia. Deposition of the ostracoderm-bearing levels of the Stairway Sandstone is dated as earliest Middle Ordovician on the northern Australian shelly scale, or late Arenigian to early Llanvirnian on the British scale. The Australian forms thus approximate in age the Spitsbergen Anatolepis Bockelie & Fortey 1976, which is at present the oldest confirmed vertebrate fossil. They antedate the North American Harding Sandstone heterostracans Astraspis Walcott 1892 and Eriptychius Walcott 1892 by some 20 million years. Unlike the North American genera, the older forms from Australia and Spitsbergen are protected by a somewhat delicate non-tesserate shield, which invites a critical reassessment of current ideas on the course of evolution of early vertebrate armour and the date of its first appearance. The scale-like sculpture of the newly discovered forms also suggest a possible source of disjunct thelodont-like denticles recovered from Ordovician sediments. The wide geographical separation of the morphologically and temporally similar Australian and Spitsbergen genera, and the consistent association of Ordovician agnathans with marine invertebrates (both body fossils and trace fossils), uphold Denison's (1967, p. 141) conclusions concerning the habitat of early vertebrates: 'They lived in the sea. The regular association of their remains with sandstones and rarely with other sediments suggests that they lived on or above a sandy bottom. They preferred well-lighted, quiet waters at moderate depths in the sublittoral zone.'",

    "abstract": "The latest Proterozoic to Early Cambrian sequences of the Amadeus and Georgina Basins of central Australia have yielded abundant and diverse trace fossils. Those of the Arumbera Sandstone are particularly significant because recent studies of that unit have shown that it is lithologically uniform and spans the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary with no discernible break. In our studies of this and other units we have been able to distinguish four assemblages of trace fossils forming a succession that we interpret as due to the evolution of bioturbating animals. The lowest strata examined occur immediately above the upper of the two Proterozoic glacial units that are widespread in Australia and comprise the Grant Bluff and Elyuah Formations of the Georgina Basin and the lower Pertatataka Formation (Cyclops Member and below) of the Amadeus Basin. These units lack definite trace fossils, despite having lithofacies comparable with those containing traces higher in the sequence. The probable fossil medusa Bunyerichnus dalgarnoi occurs at this level in the Adelaide Geosyncline, but no trace fossils are known from equivalent strata anywhere in Australia. The lack of trace fossils is significant and we draw attention to it by defining this as Assemblage 0. Assemblage 1 consists only of Planolites ballandus from the lower Elkera Formation of the Georgina Basin. This 'assemblage' predates the Ediacara fauna. Assemblage 2 contains trace fossils that in the Adelaide Geosyncline occur with the Ediacara fauna. Vertical burrows are rare in this assemblage although depressions comparable to the lower ends of U-shaped burrows have been recorded from the Adelaide Geosyncline and vertical pit-shaped traces (Hormosiroidea arumbera ichnosp. nov.) are reported here from the Central Mount Stuart Formation, Georgina Basin. Simple horizontal trails and burrows (Planolites sp.), chains of faecal pellets (Neonereites sp.) and arthropod scratch marks (Monomorphichnus sp.) also occur in this assemblage. Assemblage 3 is distinguished by its abundance and diversity of taxa, many of which are large and conspicuous — 35 ichnofossil taxa are recognised. This assemblage is characterised by the presence of deep vertical and complex subhorizontal burrows. It includes the following traces: Curvolithus aequus ichnosp. nov., Curvolithus sp., Didymaulichnus lyelli, D. miettensis, Gordia arcuata, Gordia sp., Gyrochorte sp., Helminthopsis irregularis, Muensteria sp., Nereites sp., Palaeophycus alternatus, P. canalis ichnosp. nov., P. tubularis, Phycodes pedum, Plagiogmus arcuatus, Planolites ballandus, P. beverlyensis, Torrowangea rosei, Treptichnus sp., Diplocraterion parallelum, Diplocraterion sp., Hormosiroidea arumbera ichnosp. nov., Skolithos ramosus ichnosp. nov., S. verticalis, Diplichnites sp., Monomorphichnus bilinearis and M. lineatus. Assemblage 3 occurs in the Uratanna, Parachilna and Lintiss Vale Formations of the Adelaide Geosyncline, Arumbera Sandstone members 3 and 4 in the Amadeus Basin, and the Donkey Creek beds and Mt Baldwin Formation in the Georgina Basin, amongst other units. There is sufficient sedimentological information available to indicate that the succession of assemblages cannot be attributed to environmental changes or to the colonisation of new habitats, and is best interpreted as due to evolution. Very similar successions occur worldwide at this time. Comparisons with all major sections from which trace fossils have been described, including key sections in southern China, the Baltic region and Newfoundland, indicate that Assemblage 3 is Early Cambrian (Tommotian to early Atdabanian) and Assemblages 0–2 are latest Proterozoic (Ediacarian, Vendian).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The H.Y.C. Pyritic Shale Member of the Barney Creek Formation (ca 1 500 my old; northern Australia) contains several stratiform base metal sulfide deposits of economic significance. Black cherts within these mineral deposits preserve a diverse assemblage of bacterial and algal microfossils. The assemblage differs from most other Precambrian biotas so far described in that it was deposited in deep water, it is not associated with stromatolites or algal mats, and it is dominated by filamentous bacteria, most of which are pyritized. Analysis of the assemblage suggests that the depth of the depositional basin exceeded that of the photic zone, that the bacteria inhabited the basin floor where they maintained anoxic conditions through heterotrophic degradation of detrital organic matter, and that the algae inhabited overlying near surface waters. Most of the algal fossils have been assigned to the Cyanophyta, although two of the described species are potentially referable to the eukaryotic green or red algae. Differences between this assemblage and other biotas described from the McArthur Group suggest that a workable system of biostratigraphic zonation for the Group is feasible. Fossils in the H.Y.C. assemblage are here referred to 21 species and 16 genera, of which 14 species and 6 genera are new. The new taxa are: Bacteria, Biocatenoides incrustata sp. nov., B. pertenuis sp. nov., Ramacia carpentariana gen. et sp. nov., Coleobacter primus gen. et sp. nov., Ferrimonilis variabile gen. et sp. nov.; Chroococcales (Cyanophyta), Nanococcus vulgaris gen. et sp. nov., Bisacculoides tabeoviscus gen. et sp. nov., B. vacua gen. et sp. nov., B. grandis gen. et sp. nov.; Nostocales (Cyanophyta), Oscillatoriopsis schopfii sp. nov., Cyanonema inflatum sp. nov., C. minor sp. nov.; Incertae sedis, Clonophycus elegans gen. et sp. nov., Globophycus minor sp. nov. In addition, the new combination Gunflintia septata (Schopf) is proposed.",

African elements (fossil woods) from the upper Cenozoic sediments of western India and their palaeoecological and phytogeographical significance. Alcheringa, 1–20. ISSN 0311-5518. Fossil woods resembling tropical African taxa are described from late Neogene–Pleistocene sediments of western India. They resemble the extant representatives of Baphia Afzel., Brachystegia Benth., Erythrophleum Afzel. (Fabaceae), Entandrophragma C. DC., Khaya A. Juss. (Meliaceae) and Milicia Sim (Moraceae). The discovery of these taxa indicates the invasion of African elements into the Indian subcontinent during the Plio-Pleistocene and palaeogeographic connections between the two continents. All these genera include both evergreen and deciduous representatives and grow mainly in the tropical forests of Africa. On this basis, the presence of semi-evergreen to deciduous forest is inferred in western India during the Neogene in contrast to the semi-arid to arid climate with xeric vegetation occupying parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat (western India) at present. A sub-tropical to tropical climate is also supported by the woods' physiognomic features. Two new species, including one new genus are added to the fossil assemblage of western India.

The present contribution describes an almost complete skull assigned to the aforementioned felid. The material was recovered from sediments of the Dolores Formation (Lujanian Stage/Age) from the southern part of Uruguay. This specimen is remarkable for its unusual craniodental measurements, indicating that it is one of the largest known specimens of the genus. Estimates of body mass indicate that this individual weighed over 400 kg. In addition, maximum prey size estimation greatly surpasses 1 t and approach nearly 3 t. Based on this, aspects of the paleobiology and paleoecology of S. populator are discussed. Undoubtedly, this kind of carnivorous mammal was at the top of the food chain, with clear adaptations for feeding upon the largest available herbivores, which potentially includes several megafaunal mammal species found in South America during the late Pleistocene.Aldo Manzuetti [aldomanzuetti@adinet.com.uy], Facultad de Ciencias (UdelaR), Iguá 4225, CP 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay; Daniel Perea [perea@fcien.edu.uy], Facultad de Ciencias (UdelaR), Iguá 4225, CP 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay; Washington Jones [wawijo@yahoo.com.ar], Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, 25 de Mayo 582, CP 11000, Montevideo, Uruguay; Martín Ubilla [ubilla@fcien.edu.uy], Facultad de Ciencias (UdelaR), Iguá 4225, CP 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay; Andrés Rinderknecht [apaleorinder@yahoo.com], Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, 25 de Mayo 582, CP 11000, Montevideo, Uruguay.",

    "abstract": "Kambara implexidens sp. nov. is the second crocodylomorph from the Early Eocene (Ypresian) Tingamarra Local Fauna at Boat Mountain, near the township of Murgon, southeastern Queensland. Kambara is now the best represented genus of early Tertiary crocodylomorphs yet collected from Australia. The new species differs from Kambara murgonensis in several features, the most significant of which is possession of an interlocking dentition. Both species occur in a single stratigraphic horizon, possibly indicating two sympatric populations. The presence of adults and hatclings, coupled with the rarity of intermediately sized animals in the Murgon sample suggests the area may have been used as a nesting ground by one or both species. The new material permits a detailed reassessment of the phylogenetic relationships of Australia's Tertiary crocodylians, and provides impetus for a preliminary investigation into the relationships of many putative crocodylid stem taxa. We define Crocodyloidea and Crocodylidae as the descent community and crown group respectively of extant crocodylids (species of Crocodylus, Osteolaemus tetraspis and Tomistoma schlegelii) so as to place these taxa in a taxonomy reflecting phylogenetic relationships. Our results tentatively suggest that Mekosuchinae, as defined previously, is polyphyletic; Harpacochampsa camfieldensis is more closely related to Crocodylidae, whereas all other mekosuchines appear to represent a relic Gondwanan radiation of plesiomorphic crocodyloids, outwardly similar to several early Tertiary Northern Hemisphere forms of comparable grade such as Asiatosuchus germanicus and 'Crocodylus' affinis. Within Mekosuchinae (excluding Harpacochampsa camfieldensis), species of Kambara form a clade with Australosuchus clarkae. This clade forms an unresolved trichotomy with species of Pallimnarchus and Mekosuchini (species of Baru, Mekosuchus, Quinkana and Trilophosuchus rackhami). A previous trend in the study of crocodylomorph phylogeny has been to exclude from consideration characters thought to be associated with adaptive complexes, as this was seen to introduce unnecessary homoplasy. We challenge this assumption. Detailed investigation of the distribution of such characters among crocodylians can provide significant evolutionary information at varying taxonomic levels.",

It is dominated by hexactinellid spicules. Among the forms identified as hexactinellid sponges are a new species of Konyrium Nazarov & Popov 1976, previously known only as enigmatic fossils from the Ordovician, and the new genus Silicunculus, characterized by hook-shaped spicules. Spiculated globules about 250 μm in diameter are interpreted as the skeletons of hexactinellid propagules and referred to the new genus Echidnina. Perforated globular tests 280–520 μm in diameter are referred to the genus Blastulospongia Pickett & Jell 1983,a presumed sphinctozoan sponge. Blastulospongia may alternatively be interpreted as a radiolarian similar to the spumellarian collosphaerids. The possibility of radiolarian affinities of Echidnina also is discussed, but considered less likely. Associated spicules, not referred to named taxa, are also described and figured. These include typical hexactinellid spicules as well as siliceous sclerites of unknown nature. Among the former are spicule types that indicate the presence of taxa related to the genera Multivasculatus Howell & Van Houten 1940, Rigbyella Mostler & Mosleh-Yazdi 1976 (? = Azyrtalia Nazarov 1973), and Nabaviella Mostler & Mosleh-Yazdi 1976.

Twelve species from the Eocene Nerriga locality are assigned to Laurophyllum. This represents 44% of species described from Nerriga, compared with 46% for the Middle Eocene Claiborne Formation in North America. Therefore it is possible that the Lauraceae was a widespread and dominant family in the Eocene. The leaf species from Nerriga represent a wide diversity of leaf morphologies which suggests that they may not be closely related within the family.",

The biofacies are largely lithofacies-specific and are differentiated at generic and familial levels. The composition of trilobite zonal associations in the boundary interval is controlled principally by the sequence of biofacies. Available trilobite zonal schemes can be used only within single lithofacies. The biofacies patterns and faunal dynamics across the upper boundary of the Ptychaspid Biomere do not support hypotheses requiring catastrophic events.

    "abstract": "Cretaceous polar dinosaur faunas were taxonomically diverse, which suggests varied strategies for coping with the climatic stress of high latitudes. Some polar dinosaurs, particularly larger taxa such as the duckbill Edmontosaurus Lambe, Citation1917, were biomechanically and energetically capable of migrating over long distances, up to 2600 km. However, current evidence strongly suggests many polar dinosaurs (including sauropods, large and small theropods, and ankylosaurs of New Zealand) overwintered in preference to migration. Certain groups also appear more predisposed to overwintering based on their physical inability (related to biomechanics, natural history, or absolute size) to migrate, such as ankylosaurs and many small taxa, including hypsilophodontids and troodontids. Low-nutrient subsistence is found to be the best overwintering method overall, although the likelihood that other taxa employed alternative means remains plausible. Despite wide distribution of some genera, species-level identification is required to assess the applicability of such distributions to migration distances. Presently, such resolution is not available or contradicts the migration hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Two new genera of phosphatic bradoriids are described from the insoluble residues of Middle Cambrian limestones from two sites in the Georgina Basin: Flemingia gen. nov. from south of Duchess in the late Templetonian Triplagnostus gibbus Zone in the Monastery Creek Phosphorite Member of the Beetle Creek Formation; and Oepikaluta gen. nov. from northwest of Mount Isa in the Thorntonia area in the upper (Undillan) part of the Currant Bush Limestone. The Templetonian bradoriids include five species previously described and named by Fleming (1973), the new taxa Flemingia duo gen. et sp. nov. and Dielymella? dubia sp. nov., and unnamed species belonging to Svealuta Öpik 1961 and possibly Aristaluta Öpik 1961. They appear to be part of the biocoenosis of the quiet inner margins of an ancient Bahama Banks type environment. Two new families are proposed within the suborder Phosphatocopina Müller 1964 — Oepikalutidae for Zepaera Fleming and the new genera Oepikaluta and Flemingia, and Monasteriidae for Monasterium Fleming — and the diagnosis for the Templetonian species Zepaera rete Fleming 1973 is emended. The trace of four thoracic segments in the new Undillan species Oepikaluta dissuta gen. et sp. nov. is consistent with the hypothesis of the presence of four thoracic limb pairs in the ancestral ostracode. Palaeobiogeographically, the Australian bradoriids conformed to a global pattern of establishment, rapid diversification into new lines once stocks became established, and almost equally rapid extinction of all except conservative elements of the new taxa. Carapace features are evaluated, and we conclude that Bradoriida, as currently understood, are probably polyphyletic. Thus, while the affinities of many taxa lie clearly with ostracodes, others may be more closely related to phyllocarid-like and branchiopod-like crustaceans. That three groups which are distinct today had Cambrian ancestors which were convergent in an important feature — the carapace — is consistent with the primitive nature of the caridoid grade of crustacean evolution, and can be considered supportive of a monophyletic origin for the Phylum Crustacea.",

Arthropod trackways (Diplichnites gouldi) are interpreted here to have formed on land. The most persuasive evidence for this view is that footprints vary in clarity along the length of the trackway as it traversed moist then dry silt, then biological soil crust. Compatible, though not diagnostic of walking on land is trackway symmetry, without one side buoyed up by current. The footprints bulge outward and are partially filled with miniature talus cones. Footprints also are alternate as in walking, rather than opposite as in sculling. Arthropod resting traces (Selenichnites sp. indet.) have 11 lateral furrows, and footprints are bundled into sets of 8–11, most like euthycarcinoids. No arthropod dwelling burrows were found in associated palaeosols, so the track maker was more likely amphibious than fully terrestrial. Associated trace fossils include a new ichnotaxon of burrow, Myrowichnus arenaceus gen. et sp. nov. Thallose impressions (Farghera robusta gen. et sp. nov.) have the radiating dichotomous form of lichens, algae and liverworts. All these trace and body fossils were found in weakly developed palaeosols. Other palaeosols in the same formation are evidence of terrestrial ecosystems of modest biomass, weathering, carbon sequestration and stability in dry tropical regions.",

The palaeoecology of an in situ Middle Triassic forest known as the Darwin Forest, from the Paramillo Formation of Argentina, is described based on palaeobotanical, sedimentological and spatial analyses. The palaeoforest grew on an andisol soil that developed on volcaniclastic floodplain deposits. The volcanic detritus and the rhythmic amalgamation of upper flow-regime tractional deposits overlying the andisol indicate that the forest was buried rapidly by a subaerial, cool and wet pyroclastic base surge flow. The plant community was reconstructed by quantitative mapping of the fossilized stumps integrated with taxonomic and sedimentological information. The Darwin Forest had a tree density of 427–759 per ha, with an upper stratum (20–26 m) of corystosperms and a second stratum (16–20 m) of conifers. Estimated biomass is equivalent to modern dry monsoonal forest. The understorey was composed of ferns (Cladophlebis spp.). Quantitative growth-ring analysis of Araucarioxylon protoaraucana suggests that these trees were evergreen and, together with vegetation structure and sedimentary data, indicate that the forest developed under dry, subtropical, strongly seasonal conditions.",

ISSN 0311-5518.In contrast to the rich record of eggs from non-avian dinosaurs, complete eggs attributable to Mesozoic birds are relatively scarce. Nevertheless, several well-preserved specimens have been discovered over the last three decades revealing functional and phylogenetic characters that shed light on the breeding strategies of extinct birds. Here we report the first fossil avian egg from Brazil, which was discovered in Upper Cretaceous strata of São Paulo in the southeastern part of the country. The taxonomic identity and structural features of the biomineralized tissues were determined using a combination of Scanning Electron Microscopy, Wave Dispersion Energy analyses and Computed Tomography. These show that the 125.5-μm-thick shell of the 31.4 × 19.5 mm egg incorporates three structural layers of similar thickness with both prismatic and aprismatic boundaries. Close similarity between the Brazilian bird egg and those of enantiornithines from the Upper Cretaceous Bajo de la Carpa Formation (Río Colorado Subgroup) of Argentina advocates affinity with basal Ornithothoraces. Furthermore, coherency of their depositional contexts might imply a compatible preference for breeding and nesting environments.Júlio Cesar de A.

    "abstract": "Advances in dating and systematics have prompted a revision of monotreme evolution to refine the timing of adaptative trends affecting body size and craniodental morphology. The oldest known monotreme, Teinolophos trusleri, is restricted to uppermost Barremian deposits of the Strzelecki Group in Victoria, Australia. Its body mass is estimated at ∼40 g, making it the smallest known monotreme. Teinolophos trusleri likely possessed an electro-sensitive and/or mechano-sensitive ‘bill’ or ‘beak’, which we suggest evolved for insectivory in seasonally dark Early Cretaceous polar forests. During the early Albian–mid-Cenomanian, monotremes diversified in Australia and evolved body masses greater than 4 kg, becoming amongst the largest Mesozoic mammals. A gap of 35 million years subsequently separates the youngest Mesozoic monotremes from the oldest Cenozoic monotreme, Monotrematum sudamericanum, which is a Paleocene stem ornithorhynchid from southern South America. We also hypothesize that tachyglossids originated in Melanesia, perhaps on the emergent Vogelkop landmass, and then dispersed to Australia during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. Finally, we present a classification of Monotremata to include five families—Teinolophidae fam. nov., Kollikodontidae, Steropodontidae, Ornithorhynchidae, and Tachyglossidae. We also propose a new genus, Murrayglossus gen. nov. for a gigantic Pleistocene echidna from southwestern Western Australia.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:E39E2644-DADD-49F4-B2B7-47A25C072B07Timothy F.

    "abstract": "Crocodyliform palaeontology in Australasia has a productive research record that began in the late nineteenth century and continues today. In this study, we summarize the current understanding on the taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Australasian crocodyliforms based on first-hand knowledge of relevant fossil material and a review of the published literature. The currently known fossil record of Crocodyliformes in Australasia spans more than 113 million years, from the Early Cretaceous to the Holocene, and largely consists of body fossils discovered on continental Australia. Whilst only two crocodyliform genera are recognized from Australasia's Mesozoic, the Cenozoic is distinguished by a remarkable taxonomic diversity of crocodylian crocodyliforms. By far the most common crocodylians from Australasia are members of Mekosuchinae, whose fossils are unambiguously known from the early Eocene until the Holocene. In addition to mekosuchines, during the Cenozoic Australasia was also inhabited by gavialoids and species of Crocodylus, with four extant species of the latter being the only surviving crocodylians in Australia and New Guinea. The phylogenetic relationships of Australasia's crocodylians, particularly mekosuchines, have been a topic of interest to palaeontologists for over two decades. We performed several phylogenetic analyses to test the relationships of Mekosuchinae and other extinct crocodylians. Most results from our analyses found Mekosuchinae as a basal crocodyloid clade within Longirostres. However, some of the results recovered an alternative position for the majority of mekosuchines outside of Longirostres and the Late Cretaceous–early Paleogene Orientalosuchina as its deeply nested subclade. These results suggest that Mekosuchinae had its origins in Asia during the Cretaceous, and that mekosuchines arrived from southeast Asia into Australia no later than the late Paleocene. If this hypothesis is correct, then Mekosuchinae would no longer be an Australasian endemic clade since mekosuchines also seem to have persisted on continental Asia until the late Eocene.Jorgo Ristevski [jorgo.ristevski@gmail.com], School of Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4072, Queensland, Australia; Paul M.

    "abstract": "In 2020, the Australasian palaeontological association Australasian Palaeontologists (AAP) joined the Australian government-supported Australian National Species List (auNSL) initiative to compile the first Australian Fossil National Species List (auFNSL) for the region. The goal is to assemble comprehensive systematic data on all vertebrate, invertebrate and plant fossil taxa described to date, and to present the information both within a continuously updated open-access online framework, and as a series of primary reference articles in AAP's flagship journal Alcheringa. This paper spearheads these auFNSL Alcheringa publications with an annotated checklist of Australian Mesozoic tetrapods. Complete synonymy, type material, source locality, geological age and bibliographical information are provided for 111 species formally named as of 2022. In addition, chronostratigraphically arranged inventories of all documented Australian Mesozoic tetrapod fossil occurrences are presented with illustrations of significant, exceptionally preserved and/or diagnostic specimens. The most diverse order-level clades include temnospondyl amphibians (34 species), saurischian (13 species) and ornithischian (12 species) dinosaurs (excluding ichnotaxa), and plesiosaurian marine reptiles (11 species). However, numerous other groups collectively span the earliest Triassic (earliest Induan) to Late Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian) and incorporate antecedents of modern Australian lineages, such as chelonioid and chelid turtles and monotreme mammals. Although scarce in comparison to records from other continents, Australia's Mesozoic tetrapod assemblages are globally important because they constitute higher-palaeolatitude faunas that evince terrestrial and marine ecosystem evolution near the ancient South Pole. The pace of research on these assemblages has also accelerated substantially over the last 20 years, and serves to promote fossil geoheritage as an asset for scientific, cultural and economic development. The auFNSL augments the accessibility and utility of these palaeontological resources and provides a foundation for ongoing exploration into Australia's unique natural history.Stephen F.

It consisted of at least three marsupial species; a wallaby of the genus Dorcopsis, a bandicoot (family Peroryctidae, genus indet.), and the Halmahera Group endemic cuscus Phalanger ornatus. Rattus morotaiensis, which is also endemic to the Halmahera Group, was also probably present.

Faunal remains from the Uattamdi site, on the small island of Kayoa, do not include the remains of bandicoots or wallabies. The Dorcopsis wallaby survived until around 1,870 years ago. It is possible that the bandicoot vanished slightly earlier. Sometime between around 3,410 and 1,870 ybp both pigs and dogs were successfully introduced. Today soricids, viverrids, cervids and several murid species, all of Asiatic origin, have established feral populations on Halmahera.

    "abstract": "Megafossils from six discrete clay lenses at two sites in the Alcoa Anglesea open-cut coal mine were scored for frequency of 19 leaf types to determine if the observed distinctness of the floras was real. An analysis of the pollen/spore assemblages from the six lenses and from a vertical transect taken at the second site was also undertaken (a) to confirm the age of the deposit, (b) to determine if the microfloras of the lenses were distinctive and (c) to compare mega- and microcomponents of the flora. This analysis confirmed placement of the clay lenses at the onset of the Middle Nothofagidites asperus Zone of the late Middle Eocene age. No significant differences in the microfloras of the six lenses were observed. Accessory analysis of the geology of the locality revealed a sedimentation pattern consistent with a meandering stream system, perhaps containing local lacustrine elements. All megafossil taxa identifiable to family or lower (except Lauraceae) were found to be present in the combined pollen/spore flora, but comparative frequencies were not consistent. Extant vegetation from Noah Creek in N.E. Queensland was examined and considered to provide a possible model for the Anglesea fossil flora. Along one section of Noah Creek a mosaic of physiognomic and floristic elements occurs, in an area of similar size to the Anglesea deposit. This same flora contains many of the taxa (or most nearly related taxa) identified thus far at the Anglesea Locality, including some rare associations involving Gymnostoma, Orites and members of the Musgraveinae. Further tests for the model are proposed.",

This Dromornithidae relationship is congruent with a recent phylogenetic hypothesis, based on cranial characters, that differs from the original assignment of this group of extinct birds to the Palaeognathae. Minor differences exist between previous palaeognath phylogenetic hypotheses and that obtained from this research. Some of the topological disparities might be influenced solely by inclusion of more fossil taxa in this analysis compared with those considering either molecular or skeletal characters. Surprisingly, oological data differentiate the Australasian palaeognath taxa from those of Africa and South America; this phylogenetic topology conforms to the paleognath geographic distribution. Regardless of the issues related to Paleognathae, results show that oological characters permit the differentiation of groups at a generic level, thus validating the use of eggs and eggshells as a source of evolutionary characters.",

The presence of many disharmonious pairs of taxa in these faunas implies that the Pleistocene climate was more equable than at present. The climate began to change between 16,000 and 20,000 years B.P. to less equable conditions. Faunas younger than 16,000 years B.P. contain fewer disharmonious associations and show changes in the geographic distribution of many taxa approaching their present ranges. The disappearance of numerous disharmonious associations takes place at the same time as the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. The correspondence in time of the extinction of many Pleistocene taxa and the decrease in equability of the climate suggests that the cause of the widespread extinction 16,000 to 20,000 years ago lies in this climatic change which would lower plant productivity at certain seasons, putting stress on some components of the fauna.",

Among the other 13 species described are two of the palynoflora's major components that are newly combined with the genus Rhopaliophora Tappan & Loeblich 1971 (emended herein). The acritarch assemblage correlates with zones O4 and O5 of a previous chitinozoanacritarch study in the same region (Combaz & Peniguel, 1972), but exhibits little similarity in detail with age-equivalent assemblages from elsewhere.",

The Tertiary record and possible origins for monotreme, marsupial and placental groups are reviewed. Two families are so far known only from the Tertiary. All others survived into the Quaternary. The diprotodontids, macropodids, and thylacoleonids are proving useful as a basis for correlation. The oldest known Australian mammals are late Oligocene in age and reveal little about the actual origins of the groups they represent. Four Australian marsupial groups (the dasyuroids, perameloids, thylacinids and phalangeroids) have been considered to be more closely related to American than other Australian groups. Monotremes may be derivatives of multituberculates. Too little research into the affinities of Australia's placental groups has precluded attempts to determine their precise non-Australian origins: some may be Asian, such as the rodents, but some bat groups may have had a Gondwanaland origin. From extrapolations based on the much better-known history of the North American mammals, it is possible that we know of only a third of the total Australian mammal families. There may remain about 45 additional families to be discovered in the as yet unknown earlier Tertiary Australian fossil record.",

The remarkable change in the composition of marine invertebrates between the second and third of these units, a transition that only two brachiopod species are known to survive, has been attributed to the isolation of eastern Australia and to a drop in temperature. The Marginirugus barringtonensis and Levipustula levis Zones are redefined from reference sections in the Myall region, N.S.W.; the L. levis Zone now includes the Syringothyris bifida Zone of Campbell (1961). Faunal sequences show that these two zones are closely related and that there is no hiatus between them, as formerly proposed by McKellar (1965). Conodonts identified by Mr. D. Crane indicate a late Viséan to early Namurian age for the Marginirugus barringtonensis Zone, and an age of early Namurian for the base of the Levipustula levis Zone; brachiopod evidence indicates that the L. levis Zone extends into the Westphalian. The younger Auriculispina levis Zone from the Yarrol Basin may be coeval with the Trigonotreta campbelli Zone from N.S.W. Faunas from both the L. levis and A. levis Zones are present in Argentina and many species from the L. levis Zone have affinities with forms from the Baikal region, U.S.S.R. Correlations based on the zones have eliminated the need for a hiatus between the Branch Creek and Baywulla Formations in the Yarrol Basin.

It has massively thickened umbones which maintained the shells in an upright posture analogous to that seen in the modern reef clam Tridacna. Eurydesma is preserved in this orientation in many localities in eastern Australia, and seems to have preferred hard clean sublittoral substrates; it was an opportunist which rapidly colonized sediments derived from rocky shorelines. With the possible exception of a specimen from the Late Carboniferous of Argentina, the oldest occurrences of Eurydesma are probably approximately coeval but its exit seems to be diachronous in different parts of eastern Australia; Eurydesma may have disappeared because of habitat restriction, ecological replacement, or global warming. Since its youngest occurrences can be correlated with palaeolatitude, the last is most likely.",

Palaeoecology of these Late Ordovician species, with particular emphasis on life orientation and mode of attachment, is deduced from functional morphology and faunal associations. Casquella is a minor component of a high diversity trilobite-strophomenid assemblage occupying an outer shelf habitat. The gigantic Anomaloglossa forms part of a graptolite-sponge-trilobite-brachiopod association which accumulated in a deeper-water slope environment.

    "abstract": "The distributional differentiation of Baltoscandian Middle Ordovician shelly faunas in terms of confacies belts has a counterpart in the southern and central Appalachians, where three belts, parallel to the mountain chain, are distinguished: the Blount, Tazewell and Lee Confacies Belts. As in Baltoscandia, the boundaries between these belts are sharp. The Blount Belt high-diversity shelly macrofauna is closely similar to Scoto-Appalachian faunas of northeastern Ireland and southwestern Scotland (Girvan). The Lee Belt fauna is virtually the same as that of the North American Midcontinent, and that of the Tazewell Belt is transitional between those of the Blount and Lee Belts. The ecological factors causing the confacies differentiation are currently not clearly understood but the differentiation was evidently not due to a single factor such as water depth, although this factor was apparently important for second-order differentiation (biofacies) within a confacies belt. The spatial differentiation patterns of the shelly, graptolite, and conodont faunas do not always coincide, suggesting that the factors controlling the distribution were largely specific for each fauna.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of closely spaced and rich collections of trilobites across the base of the Pterocephaliid biomere shows a distinctive pattern of changes in relative abundance of trilobites and in trilobite diversity. These patterns are repeated at the base and top of the overlying Ptychaspid biomere, but they are near the basal boundaries of, or within, the Irvingella major and Corbinia apopsis Subzones respectively, rather than at the tops of these subzones. Thus, biomere boundaries are not consistently reflected by biostratigraphic boundaries of uniform importance in the current North American trilobite assemblage zone stratigraphy. The positions of the lower and upper boundaries of the Ptychaspid biomere are here revised downward to the bases of the I. major and C. apopsis subzones. As a consequence, they are now consistent with major changes in inarticulate brachiopod and conodont faunas. The evolutionary sequence within a biomere now commences with a brief 'crisis' period during which rare elements of the soon-to-be-dominant new fauna are associated with opportunistic bursts of both new and old faunal elements. The takeover and gradual radiation of the new dominants follows this crisis period. Analysis of regional stratigraphy and of estimated radiometric ages for the boundaries of Cambrian Series, permits speculation on the abruptness of biomere boundary events and their frequency of recurrence. The event at the base of the Pterocephaliid biomere probably took place in less than 6,000 years and the next event marking the top of the Pterocephaliid biomere took place between 5 and 7.5 million years later.",

Alcheringa, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03115518.2013.748482 A remarkable assemblage of dinosaur tracks in the Winton Formation (Albian–Cenomanian) at Lark Quarry, a site in western Queensland, Australia, has long been regarded as evidence of a dinosaurian stampede. However, one recently published study has claimed that existing interpretation of Lark Quarry is incorrect because the largest track-maker at the site was misidentified and could not have played a pivotal role in precipitating a stampede. That recent study has identified the largest track-maker as an ornithopod (bipedal plant-eating dinosaur) similar or identical to Muttaburrasaurus and not, as formerly supposed, a theropod (predaceous dinosaur) resembling Allosaurus. Those iconoclastic claims are examined here and are shown to be groundless: they are based partly on misconceptions and partly on fabricated data that have been assessed uncritically using quantitative measures of questionable significance. Such ill-founded claims do not reveal any substantial flaw in the existing interpretation of the Lark Quarry dinosaur tracks.",

ISSN 0311-5518.Few Ordovician successions in the world contain both biostratigraphically highly diagnostic conodonts and graptolites permitting an integration between standard biozones based on these fossil groups. The Sandbian Guanzhuang section in the vicinity of Pingliang in the Gansu Province has an outstanding graptolite record through most of the Nemagraptus gracilis and Climacograptus bicornis graptolite biozones. Calcareous interbeds in the succession yield biostratigraphically important conodonts, including some species used for biozonations in Baltoscandia and the North American Midcontinent. Likewise, the middle–upper Darriwilian Dashimen section in the Wuhai region of Inner Mongolia hosts both diverse graptolites of the Pterograptus elegans, Didymograptus murchisoni and lowermost Nemagraptus gracilis biozones, and conodonts of Midcontinent and Baltoscandic types. The distribution patterns of these index fossil groups provide an unusual opportunity to closely correlate conodont and graptolite biozones in the middle to upper Darriwilian to Sandbian interval. For instance, the base of the C. bicornis Biozone is approximately coeval with the base of the Baltoscandic B. gerdae Subbiozone and a level near the middle of the North American P. aculeata Biozone.Zhi-hao Wang [zhwang@nigpas.ac.cn] Xu Chen [xu1936@gmail.com], and Yuan-dong Zhang [ydzhang@nigpas.ac.cn], Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; Stig M.

ISSN 0311-5518. The Talbragar Fossil Fish Bed has produced a significant number and variety of insect fossils, including the orders Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Plecoptera, Odonata, Neuroptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Mecoptera. Hemiptera are the most common insects. Coleoptera are both common and diverse. Both orders include terrestrial and aquatic species. The other insect orders represented are less common. Many of the insect fossils discovered were previously unknown in the Australian region during the Jurassic, and the new records extend their palaeogeographic range into southeastern Gondwana. A recent collection of insects, fish, coprolites, gastropods, bivalves, bark, leaves, fruiting bodies, burrows and other ichnofossils supports a model of a shallow-water-lake palaeoenvironment at the northern end of the deposit, grading to a shoreline palaeoenvironment towards the southern end of the deposit. The existence of a productive lake supporting a large population of fish and a diverse, aquatic/shoreline and terrestrial woodland fringe palaeoecosystem, dominated by insects and woody plants, is demonstrated. There is no evidence of tetrapods. The Talbragar Fossil Fish Bed has similarities to Type A and B Mesozoic lake deposits reported from Transbaikalia. Culicimorph pupae are numerous and may have filled a significant niche near the base of the aquatic palaeoecosystem. Other immature aquatic insects are rare. The generally articulated nature of the fossil insects is interpreted to have resulted from a sudden but low-energy burial event.",

Sulcusuchus erraini, from the upper Campanian–lower Maastrichtian of Patagonia, Argentina, is the only polycotylid from the Southern Hemisphere for which the skull and mandible are known. The diagnosis of the species and genus is emended based on new observations. Sulcusuchus is characterized by the following autapomorphies: (1) deep and broad rostral and mandibular grooves and (2) a wide notch on the posterior margin of the pterygoids that are combined with a part of the body of the basioccipital, forming a wide plate. Several hypotheses about the identity of the structures that could have been housed in the rostral and mandibular grooves are evaluated. Only two of several hypotheses were not discarded. The first is that the grooves may have accommodated oral glands (supralabial and sublabial), but the biological role of such glands could not be inferred. The second hypothesis is the presence of special structures of an electrosensitive and/or mechanosensitive nature, which might allow the detection of infaunal or semi-infaunal food in soft substrates, as is represented in modern analogues, such as dolphins.

[Google Scholar] from the Allaru Mudstone of Queensland, Australia's first named Cretaceous sauropod dinosaur. Alcheringa 41, 543–580. ISSN 0311-5518Austrosaurus mckillopi was the first Cretaceous sauropod reported from Australia, and the first Cretaceous dinosaur reported from Queensland (northeast Australia). This sauropod taxon was established on the basis of several fragmentary presacral vertebrae (QM F2316) derived from the uppermost Lower Cretaceous (upper Albian) Allaru Mudstone, at a locality situated 77 km west-northwest of Richmond, Queensland. Prior to its rediscovery in 2014, the type site was considered lost after failed attempts to relocate it in the 1970s. Excavations at the site in 2014 and 2015 led to the recovery of several partial dorsal ribs and fragments of presacral vertebrae, all of which clearly pertained to a single sauropod dinosaur. The discovery of new material of the type individual of Austrosaurus mckillopi, in tandem with a reassessment of the material collected in the 1930s, has facilitated the rearticulation of the specimen. The resultant vertebral series comprises six presacral vertebrae—the posteriormost cervical and five anteriormost dorsals—in association with five left dorsal ribs and one right one. The fragmentary nature of the type specimen has historically hindered assessments of the phylogenetic affinities of Austrosaurus, as has the fact that these evaluations were often based on a subset of the type material. The reappraisal of the type series of Austrosaurus presented herein, on the basis of both external morphology and internal morphology visualized through CT data, validates it as a diagnostic titanosauriform taxon, tentatively placed in Somphospondyli, and characterized by the possession of an accessory lateral pneumatic foramen on dorsal vertebra I (a feature that appears to be autapomorphic) and by the presence of a robust ventral mid-line ridge on the centra of dorsal vertebrae I and II. The interpretation of the anteriormost preserved vertebra in Austrosaurus as a posterior cervical has also prompted the re-evaluation of an isolated, partial, posterior cervical vertebra (QM F6142, the 'Hughenden sauropod') from the upper Albian Toolebuc Formation (which underlies the Allaru Mudstone). Although this vertebra preserves an apparent unique character of its own (a spinopostzygapophyseal lamina fossa), it is not able to be referred unequivocally to Austrosaurus and is retained as Titanosauriformes indet. Austrosaurus mckillopi is one of the oldest known sauropods from the Australian Cretaceous based on skeletal remains and potentially provides phylogenetic and/or palaeobiogeographic context for later taxa such as Wintonotitan wattsi, Diamantinasaurus matildae and Savannasaurus elliottorum.Stephen F.

[Google Scholar] from the Early Cretaceous of Australia is redescribed and reinterpreted here in light of additional specimens of that species and compared with the exquisitely preserved Early Cretaceous mammals from Liaoning Province, China. Together, this material indicates that although T. trusleri lacked a rod of postdentary bones contacting the dentary, as occurs in non-mammalian cynodonts and basal mammaliaforms, it did not share the condition present in all living mammals, including monotremes, of having the three auditory ossicles, which directly connect the tympanic membrane to the fenestra ovalis, being freely suspended within the middle ear cavity. Rather, T. trusleri appears to have had an intermediate condition, present in some Early Cretaceous mammals from Liaoning, in which the postdentary bones cum ear ossicles retained a connection to a persisting Meckel's cartilage although not to the dentary. Teinolophos thus indicates that the condition of freely suspended auditory ossicles was acquired independently in monotremes and therian mammals. Much of the anterior region of the lower jaw of Teinolophos is now known, along with an isolated upper ultimate premolar. The previously unknown anterior region of the jaw is elongated and delicate as in extant monotremes, but differs in having at least seven antemolar teeth, which are separated by distinct diastemata. The dental formula of the lower jaw of Teinolophos trusleri as now known is i2 c1 p4 m5. Both the deep lower jaw and the long-rooted upper premolar indicate that Teinolophos, unlike undoubted ornithorhynchids (including the extinct Obdurodon), lacked a bill.Thomas H.

    "abstract": "Palynology is used to provide new age controls for the coastal exposures yielding Early Cretaceous vertebrate faunas in the Otway and Gippsland basins, southeast Australia. This work shows all vertebrate-bearing deposits in the Otway Basin are Albian in age. On the eastern margin of Cape Otway, vertebrate-bearing deposits are attributed to the early Albian Crybelosporites striatus Zone, except for one in the younger Coptospora paradoxa Zone. To the west of Cape Otway, the sampled deposits range from the oldest zone in the Albian, the C. striatus Zone, to the C. paradoxa and Phimopollenites pannosus zones, providing a complete section of the Albian stage. In the Gippsland Basin, the structural setting of vertebrate deposits is more complicated and large portions of the coastal exposures consist of repeated sections controlled by small-scale faults. Sites in this region lie below or above the Barremian/Aptian boundary. However, owing to the paucity of age indicator species, some sampled deposits remain undated. In this basin, the ranges of certain key palynomorph species (e.g., Pilosisporites notensis and Pilosisporites parvispinosus) differed from those outlined in some previously published biostratigraphic schemes. The discovery of the angiosperm pollen Clavatipollenites hughesii in the lowermost Aptian deposits of the Gippsland Basin is consistent with its first occurrence elsewhere in Australia and shows it is a reliable indicator for the Aptian stage. This study shows that there is currently a collection bias towards vertebrate assemblages that are latest Barremian and early Albian in age.Barbara E.

    "abstract": "Six species of monotremes, three newly described here, occur in the Cenomanian fossil fauna from Lightning Ridge in northeastern New South Wales, Australia, making it the most diverse monotreme assemblage on record. Four species are known from a single specimen, suggesting that diversity remains underrepresented. No other mammal lineages are known from the deposit, although the absence of smaller taxa is likely due to sampling biases introduced by the opal mining process. Early-Late Cretaceous monotremes thus clearly diversified in Australia during the absence of other large-bodied mammalian competitors; and subsequently occupied a wider range of ecological niches than at any other time in their evolutionary history. One new taxon described herein represents a previously unknown monotreme family that combines marked elongation and torsion of the dentary with teinolophid character states, including the retention of five molars. Another shares dental features with ornithorhynchids, while the third is a possible diminutive steropodontid and simultaneously represents the smallest-bodied post-Barremian monotreme. Additional material of Steropodon galmani is also documented, confirming that a Meckelian groove is rudimentary or absent in this taxon, thus adding to the morphological understanding of this unusual monotreme. Lastly, we posit that the loss of teeth in ornithorhynchids may have occurred during the Pleistocene as a result of competition with aquatic hydromyin rodents dispersing to Australia from New Guinea.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular phylogenetic studies of extant organisms have shown that those branches of the Bacteria and Archaea that lie closest to the \"last common ancestor\" of all life are occupied by hyperthermophiles. At the same time, the search for former life on Mars has focussed on thermal spring deposits. For these reasons there is interest in the palaeobiology of ancient thermal spring deposits on Earth. Many such deposits are known but very few have been studied by palaeobiologists. The Devonian sinters of the Drummond Basin, Australia, rank with the Rhynie cherts of Scotland as the oldest well established examples of fossil subaerial hot springs. The Drummond Basin sinters are closely comparable with modem examples in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and elsewhere. It is possible to recognise a range of palaeoenvironments from high temperature vents through former hot-water channelways and terraces to ambient temperature marsh deposits. Cyanobacterial stromatolites and microfossils are abundant in those palaeoenvitronments characterised by temperatures well above ambient, and the marsh and other ambient temperature palaeoenvironments contain abundant herbaceous lycopsids and sphenopsids encrusted by microbial overgrowths.

Only one species of seed fern is known from this flora and its affinities were unclear until discovery of its reproductive organs and complete large leaves. An ovuliferous reproductive organ, Peltaspermum townrovii sp. nov., can be attributed to the same plant as the leaves because of their identical stomatal apparatus, which is cyclocytic with papillae overhanging the stomatal pit. Polleniferous organs, Permotheca helbyi sp. nov., may have belonged to the same plant, but are only linked by evidence of association on the same bedding plane yielding no other gymnosperms. Pollen masses found within the polleniferous organ include grains identified as Falcisporites australis (de Jersey) Stevens (1981) when found dispersed. The leaves of this plant have long been enigmatic and attributed to ‘Thinnfeldia’ callipteroides or ‘Dicroidium’ callipteroides; however, these genera had very different cuticular structure. Reassessment of the frond architecture of this plant, based on a large, nearcomplete specimen together with information from cuticles and ovuliferous organs, allows reassignment to Lepidopteris callipteroides (Carpentier) comb. nov. The remarkable cuticle thickness, small stomatal size and low stomatal index of these leaves reflect a time of unusually high atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. This plant was an invader of the Sydney Basin from northern Gondwana, spreading southward during the post-apocalyptic earliest Triassic greenhouse.

Thylacosmilus atrox developed a longer neck than in non-sabretooth borhyaenoids and was capable of strong flexion of the head. The lower back is well-stabilized and more rigid than in the other borhyaenoids. The forelimb appears well-suited for manipulating and capturing prey, with a probably well-developed deltoid and pectoral musculature. Compared with other Miocene borhyaenoids, the hip joint of Thylacosmilus is modified to allow greater postural flexibility (e.g. possibility of erect stances). The low greater femoral trochanter, the short and sigmoid tibia, and the semiplantigrade hind foot of Thylacosmilus precluded fast running. Thylacosmilus killed by stabbing, a peculiar mechanism that evolved in parallel in many other sabretooth taxa. This technique has significant functional-adaptive consequences on the postcranial skeleton, superimposed on the generalized morphological pattern reflected in its non-sabertooth relatives. The superficial similarities observed between Thylacosmilus and Smilodon overshadow real differences (at the level of joint patterns and muscular groups involved in particular movements), a condition that suggests the development in the marsupial form of a morphological type unique to the thylacosmilid lineage within Borhyaenoidea.",

Abundant Azolla remains in Bolivia add to this portrait of rapid geographie dispersai and diversification near the close of the Cretaceous. The ranges of many Azolla species span the Cretaceous- Palaeogene boundary and the potential of Azolla to withstand altered environmental conditions, such as periodic frost damage, drought, and salinity change, and its ability to undergo rapid vegetative regeneration in association with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts, suggest that the survival of this group was favoured during the adverse conditions of the end-Cretaceous event.",

    "abstract": "Trilobite remains display a range of taphonomic properties which provide useful information regarding the distribution of environmental conditions. Particular deposits, when viewed in proper perspective, may represent specific palaeobiological and behavioural phenomena for which tenable explanations can be proposed and evaluated. Trilobite lagerstätten typically comprise thoroughly and partially disarticulated remains, and less frequently include outstretched and/or enrolled corpses and intact exuviae. Rarely, trilobite remains (carcass, moult, or disarticulated segments) compose dense, localized patches and bioclastic deposits. Taphonomic properties appear non-randomly in the stratigraphic record and, therefore, characterize taphonomic facies (or taphofacies). Comparative taphonomy of remains provides an index by which ambient sedimentary conditions can be characterized and palaeoenvironmental settings synthesized. Trilobites, like other organisms with multi-element skeletons, were particularly sensitive to disarticulation. In general, nearshore facies are characterized by an abundance of disarticulated remains. Biostratinomic details indicate that disarticulation was mediated by one or more of three processes: current agitation, shallow (surficial) bioturbation, deep (intrastratal) bioturbation. Offshore facies, in contrast, are distinguished by a greater number of articulated moults and bodies, sometimes associated with the by-products of early carbonate and/or pyrite diagenesis. The relative abundance of disarticulated tergites, outstretched carcasses, enrolled corpses, and intact exuviae provides important data that are related to specific physico-chemical phenomena associated with sedimentary events (e.g., storms, turbidity currents). As vagrant benthos, trilobites were characterized by complex behaviour which may be reflected by biostratinomic details of their articulated remains. Trilobites, like most arthropods, moulted and therefore contributed potentially fossilizable material to the sediment prior to death. Articulated remains provide the only tangible data available for understanding fossil trilobites as once living organisms with diagnostic biological and behavioural attributes. Detailed taphonomic comparisons call attention to otherwise unsuspected aspects of trilobite ecdysis, enrollment, and gregarious behaviour.",

The surfaces of these very thin folia are not the basal pinacoid of calcite (0001), as has previously been stated, but in each species studied are one of the rhombohedral forms (1011), (1012) or (0112). One of these rhombohedra, (1012), is rarely found in non-biological calcite because it lies perpendicular to a direction of very fast crystal growth. Another form, (1011), is much more widespread; it occurs commonly in inorganic crystals, and it lies parallel to the secreting surface in the skeletal calcite of some scallops and oysters, in the pentaliths of some planktonic algae, in the tests of some forams, and in the outer layer of the hen eggshell. By contrast, the foliated calcite of some extinct articulate brachiopods appears to be composed of laths which are flattened parallel to (0001); this material therefore differs significantly from the foliated calcite of bivalve molluscs. The ability of anomiids to specify the rare calcite form (1012) may result from a precise stereochemical fit between the amino acid residues of the matrix protein and the spacing of calcium atoms in the surfaces of the underlying and overlying mineral layers. Analogous or homologous β-sheets may specify the two other types of foliated calcite.",

    "abstract": "Based on a review here, the most recent Tasmanian devil remains on the mainland date from between 3000 and 4000 years BP in three isolated populations. A widely promulgated recent date within the last 500 years is rejected. Previous studies have found the arrival of the dingo (>3500 BP) to be the only suitable coincident extinction cause, although Aboriginal cultural changes have also been recently implicated. I propose that increased climate variability associated with the onset of the El Niño Southern Oscillation after 6000 BP and a subsequent intensification ca 3000 BP was also a causative factor. Other causes are not rejected, but rather all are placed within a multicausal model. Tasmanian devils are particularly susceptible to climate variability because they are the only specialised scavenger in Australia. Specialised scavengers are mostly limited by variability in the availability of carrion, and this would have increased significantly with ENSO. The fossil record (and persistence in Tasmania) indicates a range contraction of Tasmanian devils from the late Pleistocene onwards towards isolated refugia into those parts of the country least affected by ENSO related climate variability.",

    "abstract": "Chuaria is widespread in Late Precambrian deposits throughout the world. In China it has been found in the Jingeryu Formation of Jixian County, Tianjin, and in its equivalents in eastern China including the Nanfen Formation of Liaoning and Jilin Provinces, and the Liulaobei Formation of Anhui Province. In the latter, Chuaria is associated with the genus Tawuia which Hofmann (in Hofmann & Aitken, 1979) described as algae of undertermined affinity and which is based on material from Canada. The glauconitic sandstone directly resting upon Chuaria-bearing greyish-green shale of the Jingeryu Formation in Jixian County has a K-Ar age of 0.899 Ga. This paper describes C. circularis Walcott, T. dalensis Hofmann and T. sinensis n. sp., and discusses the morphology, biological and taxonomic affinities, and age and geographic distribution of Chuaria. Because of the association of Chuaria and Tawuia in the Mackenzie Mountains, Canada, and also in the area of Shouxian County, Anhui Province, China, it is considered that Chuaria and Tawuia probably have close affinities. According to their general morphology and occurrence, both may be marine planktonic multicellular algae.",

Alcheringa 32, 427–441. ISSN 0311-5518. An anatomically preserved mature stem from the Salamanca Formation (early Paleocene) at Palacio de Los Loros, central Patagonia, Argentina, is described and assigned to Paracacioxylon frenguellii sp. nov. The material was preserved by siliceous permineralization and shows features of the secondary xylem typical of subfamily Mimosoideae. This species represents the oldest record of the genus and of the Leguminosae along the western border of Gondwana, and is the world's second oldest record of Leguminosae wood. The species is characterized by ring-porous to semi-ring-porous vessels that are solitary, in multiples of 2–4 and clustered, simple perforation plates, alternate and vestured inter-vessel pitting, homocellular 1–6 seriate rays, tyloses, crystals and diffuse apotracheal, vasicentric paratracheal and confluent axial parenchyma. Paracacioxylon frenguellii has anatomical similarities to Acacia Miller. The presence of Paracacioxylon frenguellii associated with pulvinate leaves suggests that the legumes might have been a component of mesothermal forests developed along the western margin of the Golfo San Jorge Basin during the early Paleocene.

B. tatongensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from all other species possessing a trifid preorbital recess by the short postpineal plate with paired pits opening anteriorly into the orbital fenestra, and by coarsely reticulate dermal ornament. B. gippslandiensis Hills, B. cullodenensis Long, B. fergusoni Long, B. bindareei Long and B. warreni Long are described and illustrated. Metric analysis of headshield and premedian plate measurements of B. gippslandiensis, B. cullodenensis and B. fergusoni are compared with ontogenetic variation in B. canadensis Whiteaves. The phylogenetic position of B. fergusoni and B. tatongensis sp. nov. is discussed and the significance of the preorbital recess in bothriolepid evolution re-evaluated. A trifid preorbital recess is suggested to be apomorphic within the Bothriolepidoidei by comparison with the homologous structures in other antiarchs. The composition of the Tatong fauna indicates a late Givetian-early Frasnian age for the base of the Hollands Creek Rhyodacite, and the onset of post-Tabberabberan sedimentation in the southern end of the Lachlan Fold Belt.",

The Araucariaceae have a long record in New Zealand, extending back to the Jurassic at least, and Araucaria extends back to at least the Late Cretaceous. This paper reviews the macrofossil record of the family and presents new information based largely on the leaf cuticle record. Agathis, which is the only genus of the family currently growing in New Zealand, has no record before the Cenozoic. All specimens previously identified from pre-Cenozoic strata clearly belong to other taxa or do not show characteristic features of the genus. Araucariaceae macrofossils are virtually ubiquitous in the Cretaceous assemblages of New Zealand but are conspicuous by their absence or rarity in Palaeocene deposits. Their demise may be an expression of events at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary.",

The other specimen is indistinguishable from extant adult N. gunnii leaves, and has been assigned to that species. This fossil shows that the deciduous habit was probably already present in N. gunnii by the Oligocene, and this may have helped N. gunnii to survive the Late Tertiary/Quaternary glaciations.

A number of possible functions are considered for these ridges and none but respiration is found to be feasible. Supportive evidence for the hypothesis outlined is drawn from consideration of the paradigm for a dorsal respiratory system and from a comparison with living crustacea.",

The most distinctive species in the fauna, S. diversus, consists of a trimembrate apparatus, including symmetrical Sa, asymmetrical Sb and strongly asymmetrical Sc elements. This species concept is supported by the absence of any other element types in a large collection represented by nearly 500 specimens of this species. The fauna indicates a late Tremadocian to mid-Floian age (Early Ordovician) for the Honghuayuan Formation, which was widely distributed on the Yangtze Platform in shallow water environments. Previously published biostratigraphic zonations for the Honghuayuan Formation are reviewed, and revised on the basis of our knowledge of the entire conodont fauna, supporting the establishment of three biozones, Triangulodus bifidus, Serratognathus diversus, and Prioniodus honghuayanensis biozones in ascending order.

The metriorhynchid crocodyliform Cricosaurus araucanensis (Gasparini & Dellapé) has been documented from Tithonian (Upper Jurassic) strata of the Vaca Muerta Formation exposed in the Neuquén Basin, northwest Patagonia, Argentina. Postcranial components of this species were mentioned but not described in the original analysis. Subsequently, other authors described the forelimbs. The postcranial elements of metriorhynchids are poorly documented in comparison with their skulls, but new data from C. araucanensis reveal delayed ossification of the caudal neurocentral sutures indicating skeletal paedomorphosis affecting not only the appendicular skeleton but also the posterior region of the vertebral column. The morphology of the caudal region (transverse processes of the first caudal vertebrae ventrally deflected) and the reduction in the femur of the fourth trochanter suggest a reduction of the hypaxial musculature allowing increased epaxial musculature. This pattern of musculoskeletal arrangement is consistent with the swimming style and propulsion by lateral undulation of the tail, as proposed by previous authors.

ISSN 0311-5518.Various comparisons of left metacarpal I of the Australovenator wintonensis holotype have been made with Rapator ornitholestoides. These specimens were identified as being morphologically more similar than either was to that of the neovenatorid Megaraptor namunhuaiquii. Owing to the poor preservation of A. wintonensis and R. ornitholestoides, distinct morphological separation between the two appeared minimal. The recent discovery of a near perfectly preserved right metacarpal I of A. wintonensis enables a direct and accurate comparison with R. ornitholestoides. Distinct morphological differences exist between the metacarpals of the two species. A re-evaluation of the age of the A. wintonensis holotype site (AODL 85 'Matilda Site') with zircon dating reveals a maximum age of 95 Ma, 10 Ma younger than the Griman Creek Formation at Lightning Ridge, from which R. ornitholestoides was recovered. This age difference detracts from the probability that the specimens belong to the same genus.Matt A.

The matrix included 16 species of Glyptodontidae and 35 characters, from which 14 correspond to the skull, four to the dentition, two to the cephalic armour, nine to the dorsal carapace and six to the caudal sheath. Propalaehoplophorus australis (Propalaehoplophorinae) was used to root the trees. Four most parsimonious trees were obtained (Tree Length = 75, CI = 0.65, RI = 0.70). The strict consensus tree (Tree Length = 77, CI = 0.64, RI = 0.68) has the following topology: Propalaehoplophorus australis (Glyptodon reticulatus (Hoplophorus euphractus (Panochthus jaguaribensis, P. intermedius (P. frenzelianus, P. tuberculatus (P. subintemedius, P. greslebini)))) ((Pseudoplohophorus absolutus, Plohophorus figuratus) (Nopachtus cabrerai, N. coagmentatus, Propanochthus bullifer, Stromaphorus compressidens, Phlyctaenopyga ameghini))). The results indicate that: 1, Panochthini is not a natural group but polyphyletic; 2, Panochthus is monophyletic and, concordant with recent proposals, Hoplophorus euphractus is its sister group; and 3, Nopachtus and Propanochthus are more closely related to species traditionally referred to 'Plohophorini' than to Panochthus.

This, combined with records of smaller plesiosaurian teeth with an alternative morphology, provides evidence for a multitaxic freshwater plesiosaurian assemblage. Dental and body size differences suggest ecological partitioning of sympatric freshwater plesiosaurians analogous to that in modern freshwater odontocete cetaceans. The evolutionarily plastic body plan of Plesiosauria may have facilitated niche differentiation and helped them to exclude ichthyosaurs from freshwater environments during the Mesozoic.

The first evidence of ankylosaurian thyreophorans from the Winton Formation (late Albian–Cenomanian) of central-western Queensland, Australia, reveals new information about the temporal and palaeobiogeographical range of these dinosaurs within Gondwana. The material, which comprises isolated teeth, is the youngest evidence of ankylosaurs in Australia. Although the Winton teeth exhibit a suite of pleisiomorphic characteristics that are also seen in other Australian and Gondwanan ankylosaur taxa, they are morphologically distinct and very likely represent a new taxon.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sphenophytes are a common floral element in the Triassic of Gondwana. Most sphenophyte compression fossils have been conventionally assigned to a few, presumably very widespread species of Neocalamites based on vegetative features of the stems (or pith casts) and the foliage. During recent decades, however, new reports on morphological and anatomical details of some of these fossils have cast doubt on the systematic affinities of many Gondwanan Triassic sphenophytes. Here we describe Neocalamites suberosus (Artabe & Zamuner) nov. comb. et emend. and Schizoneura africana Feistmantel emend. from several Triassic deposits in the central Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land, East Antarctica. The material enables a critical reevaluation of morphological and anatomical features that have been historically used to define the two genera, including leaf-base morphology, degree of leaf fusion, stem vasculature and vallecular canals, and features of the nodal diaphragm. The diagnoses of Neocalamites and Schizoneura are emended so that they more accurately reflect recent advances in our understanding of the anatomy and ontogeny of these plants.

Biodiversity and palaeoecology of Foulden Maar: an early Miocene Konservat-Lagerstätte deposit in southern New Zealand. Alcheringa 40, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518.This paper highlights the biodiversity and palaeoecology of the 23 million year old Foulden Maar, the first Konservat-Lagerstätte deposit described from New Zealand and a key site for reconstructing early Miocene Southern Hemisphere terrestrial ecosystems. The 1000-m-diameter, ca 200-m-deep Foulden Maar volcanic crater lake was a closed system with anoxic bottom waters, capturing and preserving in exquisite detail organisms from the lake and adjacent rainforest. The fossils include numerous leaves, flowers with in situ pollen, fruits, seeds, fish and arthropods. Surrounding Foulden Maar was an evergreen, Lauraceae-dominated notophyll vine forest with a diverse understorey, lianes, epiphytes and mistletoes. Diverse pollination and seed dispersal modes are evident. Fish include larval to adult stages of articulated specimens of Galaxias, some with preserved soft tissue and a species of eel resembling Anguilla. The arthropod fauna comprises ca 20 families in the orders Araneae (spiders), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Odonata (dragonflies), Isoptera (termites), Hemiptera (true bugs), Diptera (true flies), Coleoptera (beetles), Trichoptera (caddis flies) and Hymenoptera (wasps, ants and bees), representing faunas typical of soil, leaf litter, forest floor or freshwater habitats. Many fossil taxa have close relatives in the extant New Zealand biota; others are now locally extinct. Coprolites containing quartz sands sourced from outside the lake indicate the presence of volant birds, presumably waterfowl. The Foulden Maar Lagerstätte is crucial for reconstructing Miocene lake and forest ecosystems in New Zealand, particularly the terrestrial arthropod component.Daphne E.

The CV Zone is dominated by diverse non-taeniate bisaccate, plicate and taeniate pollen. Monosaccate and monosulcate pollen, algae and acritarchs are poorly represented in both biozones. The composition of the TC Zone is broadly similar to the CV Zone, but bisaccate pollen grains are markedly more diverse and abundant in the former.",

Alcheringa 39, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518The oldest unequivocal dinosaurian records come from Upper Triassic strata, mostly from Argentina and Brazil. Recent fieldwork in the Brazilian deposits of Ischigualastian age (late Carnian–earliest Norian) have resulted in the collection of a new specimen (UFRGS-PV-1240-T) identified as dinosaurian by the presence of a concave emargination on the ventral surface of the femoral head and a well-developed deltopectoral crest on the humerus, which extends for ca 40% of its estimated proximodistal length. Although fragmentary, the material increases the dinosaurian record from the Late Triassic of Brazil, which is still modest when compared with coeval Argentine strata. Additionally, UFRGS-PV-1240-T augments the dinosaurian diversity at the 'Sítio Janner' site, which was until now restricted to the sauropodomorph Pampadromaeus barberenai. The new specimen is larger than most early dinosaurians (except for herrerasaurids), implying that members of the group were already occupying niches otherwise explored by other larger-bodied taxa in the 'Sítio Janner' palaeofauna, and Late Triassic palaeoenvironments in general.Flávio A.

Alcheringa 43, 351–380. ISSN 0311-5518.A succession of diverse hyolith assemblages comprising 10 genera and 14 species are reported from the lower Cambrian Shangwan and Sanjianfang sections of the Xinji Formation, and Xiaomeiyao section of the Houjiashan Formation, which crop out along the southern margin of the North China Platform. Most of the specimens are represented by both conchs and opercula. The identified orthothecids include Conotheca australiensis, Cupitheca holocyclata, C. costellata, Neogloborilus applanatus, N. spinatus, Tegminites hymenodes, Triplicatella disdoma, T. xinjia sp. nov. and Paratriplicatella shangwanensis gen. et sp. nov. The hyolithids comprise Protomicrocornus triplicensis gen. et sp. nov., Microcornus eximius, M. petilus, Parkula bounites and Parakorilithes mammillatus. Some anomalous taxa possess characteristics of both Hyolithida and Orthothecida, such as C. australiensis, Neogloborilus and P. triplicensis. Protomicrocornus may constitute a sister group of other hyolithids. The teeth of Parkula bounites and clavicles of Parakorilithes mammillatus are documented for the first time. The hyolith assemblages from North China are probably coeval, and can be correlated with the Cambrian upper Stage 3–lower Stage 4. Many taxa are also globally distributed and have significant potential for biostratigraphical correlations. In accordance, the hyoliths from North China reveal closest compositional similarities to faunas from eastern Gondwana, and especially South Australia. However, some taxa are shared with Laurentian assemblages suggesting cosmopolitanism, and possibly planktonic larval dispersal.Bing Pan* [bpan@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Christian B.

    "abstract": "Phosphatised conchs and opercula of various hyoliths, 1–2 mm in size, retaining original skeletal microstructures have been extracted with dilute acetic acid from Lower Cambrian carbonates of northern Siberia. The conchs grew by deposition of new lamellae on the inner side of the aperture. Two microstructural types are recognised among the conchs assigned to the Allathecidae, namely with a simple or composite inner layers. The conchs are built of inner and outer layers of mineralised fibre bundles. In the outer layer the bundles are longitudinally oriented. Their external ends are inclined toward the apex of conch. Each bundle contains a channel. Transverse bundles of the inner layer commonly run around the conch but may branch toward the aperture and produce an orthogonal network. The inner layer in this case is composite and consists of two sublayers. In the outer sublayer the bundles are situated transversely around the conch, and in the inner sublayer the bundles are directed longitudinally. Channels between the bundles of the inner layer were possibly connected to those of the outer layer and reflect a system of tubules. The latter possibly participated in biomineralisation and provided a framework, which reinforced the skeleton. The tubules do not penetrate the outermost portion of the outer layer. Septa display radially arranged fibrous microfabric with the evidence of a centripetal growth from the inner surface of conch. The opercula consisted of series of growth lamellae each containing fibres, oriented radially, and tubules. The tubules were almost normal to the growth surfaces and concentrated in the opercular limb. The hyolith skeleton probably contained organic fibres mineralised by aragonite and commonly fused into bundles. The affinity of the Hyolitha to a separate phylum may be supported by this microstructural investigation.",

    "abstract": "A large rock slab collected in 1913 from the roof of the Bellambi Colliery in the southern Sydney Basin bears fossil tracks that are now known from recent radiometric and chemostratigraphic dating to be earliest Triassic, rather than latest Permian, in age. The tracks show two distinctive features of reptiles: scale impressions and claw marks. Both manus and pes are pentadactyl, ectaxonic, semidigitigrade and have an outer interdigital angle (digits IV–V) greater than inner interdigital angles. Digit proportions are consistent with a phalangeal formula of 23333. The fossil tracks are referred to the ichnospecies Dicynodontipus bellambiensis sp. nov. They are similar to the kinds of tracks thought to be produced by Lystrosaurus species. Given the abundance of these species in Early Triassic faunas of low diversity and the occurrence of members of the Lystrosaurus fauna in Queensland and Antarctica, chances are good that this is indeed a trackway of Lystrosaurus. If considered to be made by an animal of that type, the trackway was produced using the primitive alternate gait, rather than the mammalian amble, by an animal about 84 cm long and some 22 cm high. Preservation of bones of these creatures would not be expected given the non-calcareous nature of associated fossil soils in the Sydney Basin Triassic. Herbaceous lycopods, locally common in these and other Early Triassic strata worldwide, are among the most likely foods of these tusked, low-browsing herbivores.",

The older assemblage (11 species) occurs in the uppermost Kulpara Formation and conformably overlying basal Parara Limestone, and is equivalent to Lower Faunal Assemblage II in the Flinders Ranges. The younger assemblage (28 species plus Acanthhcyathus and Rodiocyathus) occurs in the Koolywurtie Member near the top of the Parara Limestone. Equivalent taxa are widespread in the Flinders Ranges, western New South Wales and Antarctica. Archaeocyathan distribution is now sufficiently well known to propose three assemblage zones and two informal assemblages for regional correlation. No new taxa have been added, but Erugatocyathus scutatus (Hill) and Pycnoidocyathus latiloculatus (Hill), hitherto known only from Antarctica, are found in the upper assemblage on Yorke Peninsula.

The Plagiogmus forming organism/s was/were connected to the surface by a siphon that formed a longitudinal furrow. Collapse associated with the movement of the siphon through the sediment may have produced a variety of trace fossil morphologies similar to the ichnogenera Gordia, Cochlichnus and Taphrhelminthopsis. Other parts of the Plagiogmus burrow may be compared with Olivellites, Aulichnites, Laminites, Climactichnites and Psammichnites ispp. The distinctive transverse bars of the Plagiogmus structure are interpreted as being produced by a posterior sucker used by the animal during locomotion. It is interpreted that the burrow fill was composed solely of feeding wastes and not the spoils of tunnelling. The laminae within the backfill are not related to the transverse bars. Bilobed burrows overlying the Plagiogmus component are related to the presence of a siphon that we interpret to have been used in surface deposit feeding. The biological affinities of the Plagiogmus-forming animal remain obscure, but it was probably vermiform and shared characters with the Mollusca, Annelida, Hirundinea and/or some echinuran worms.",

The ages of brachiopod zones, which have been most used for regional correlation throughout eastern Australia, are revised using new conodont information from Jenkins et al. (1993), recent revisions of European ammonoid zones (Riley, 1990a, 1991), existing foraminiferal/algal data, and new internal evidence from brachiopods. Major changes include recognition that: the Tulcumbella tenuistriata Zone straddles the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary and extends into the mid-Hastarian (Tn1b-lowest Tn2b); the Schellwienella burlingtonensis Zone is late Hastarian to earliest Molinacian (Tn2c-Tn3c) in age; the Orthotetes australis Zone early Visean (Chadian to early Arundian; V1a-V1b) rather than late Visean in age based on new data from conodonts and reinterpretation of the ammonoid evidence; the Delepinea aspinosa Zone ranges in age from Arundian to early Holkerian (V1b to V2b), though the boundary with the succeeding Rhipidomella fortimuscula Zone cannot be well defined; the fortimuscula Zone is late Holkerian to Asbian (V3b), with the top of the zone being taken within the B2b ammonoid zone; and the Marginirugus barringtonensis Zone extends throughout the remainder of the Asbian and the Brigantian, to the end of the late Visean. Gondwanan assemblages succeeding the Early Carboniferous cosmopolitan faunas cannot be readily correlated with Northern Hemisphere biozones. The Levipustula levis Zone is Namurian in age at the base.

The palynoflora is dominated by Nothofagidites emarcidus/heterus (43%) and Phyllocladidites mawsonii (45%), although neither is represented in the macroflora. The total palynoflora is interpreted as representing a moderately diverse riparian rainforest, including and possibly dominated by one or more Nothofagus-conifer associations. The macroflora is dominated by imbricate-leaved conifers and microphyllous angiosperms. It is hypothesised that the macroflora represents the litter from exposed forest edges, where the microclimate was more variable than under the forest canopy. This forest edge habitat at high altitudes may represent the environment in which the alpine/subalpine flora evolved. Contemporaneous floras from mainland Australia are compared with Monpeelyata.

    "abstract": "Overkill by human hunting has been cited consistently as a likely cause of the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions in Australia, but little archaeological evidence has been found to support the notion of prehistoric Aboriginal people engaging in specialised \"big game\" hunting more than 40 millennia ago. Here we develop a demographic population model that considers explicitly the potential impact of harvest of small, immature (and presumably more vulnerable) individuals of the largest known marsupial, Diprotodon opoptatum. We show that remarkably low levels of exploitation of juveniles (the equivalent of one or two kills per 10 people per year) would have been sufficient to drive these large species to extinction within centuries, as a consequence of their \"slow\" life-histories. This conclusion is robust to assumptions regarding the compensatory response of the prey species and declines in the relative efficiency of hunting as the megafaunal populations declined. These findings dispel the idea that, at least in Australia, evidence for a sophisticated hunting toolkit and massive kill-sites are a necessary adjunct to \"blitzkrieg\". Ironically, although the extinction event was likely geochronologically instantaneous (given the coarse resolution of dating from that time), on the scale of human (and megafaunal) lifetimes, the unfolding overkill would have been all but imperceptible.",

Bradoriid specimens of Mongolitubulus unispinosa sp. nov. exhibiting a single mature ornamented spine attached to the central portion of the carapace provides definitive evidence of a bradoriid affinity for the enigmatic, widespread Mongolitubulus small shelly fossil taxon. The assemblage includes several species that facilitate correlation with the Stansbury Basin of South Australia, but also with faunas from other Cambrian palaeocontinents, including Antarctica and Laurentia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Maslin Bay flora of South Australia is of lower Middle Eocene age and contains diverse, well preserved angiosperm assemblages. It has yielded 2700 specimens belonging to approximately 200 leaf taxa. Physiognomic analysis (sensu Webb, 1959; Wolfe 1970) indicates greatest similarity to extant Simple Mesophyll Vine Forest and Complex Notophyll Vine Forest found currently in Queensland. Preliminary taxonomic studies have confirmed the presence of taxa closely resembling Podocarpus (Podocarpaceae), Agathis (Araucariaceae), Fatsia (Araliaceae) and Banksia (Proteaceae). Microfloral analysis of the deposit confirms the presence of the latter three families, but suggests far greater occurrence of Proteaceae than the number of leaf specimens of this family indicates. Nothofagus pollen is the dominant type, although leaves of this genus are absent from collections. Based on sedimentation, physiognomy and systematic studies of leaves and fungi (Lange, 1969) it is concluded that the Maslin Bay region supported tropical to subtropical rain forest during the lower Middle Eocene.",

    "abstract": "Ichthyosaur fossils have been recorded from four landmasses in the Australasian region—Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Timor—and occur in all three systems of the Mesozoic. Most of the remains are non-diagnostic, but at least three genera have been identified: Mixosaurus, from the Middle Triassic of Timor; Shonisaurus, from the Upper Triassic of New Caledonia; and Platypterygius, from the Lower Cretaceous of Australia and New Zealand. Of these, Platypterygius contains the only material that can be diagnosed to species level. However, current taxonomy of the specimens is controversial, with two synonyms, P. australis and P. longmani, persisting in the literature. An examination of cranial traits in the 'quasi-holotype' of P. australis vs P. longmani demonstrates that they represent the same taxon. Thus, P. longmani should be regarded as the junior synonym. A neotype is also here designated for P. australis to replace the original, which is presumed lost.",

Interpretation of functional morphology of these species supports reconstruction of the plectambonitacean schizolophe in a position largely anterior to the dorsal muscle field. Feeding current directions are inferred from distribution of marginal setal grooves and internal ridge/channel systems. In general, inhalant currents entered the shell anterolaterally and laterally, being exhausted medially and/or posterolaterally. Species of Sericoidea and Sowerbyella described here occur in deep-water graptolitic sediments and display morphological adaptations consistent with either an epiplanktic habit, or attachment to localised firm substrates on or slightly above the sea floor.",

This discovery represents the first record of this family in the Triassic of Argentina and the southernmost record of South American Triassic 'conchostracans' (Spinicaudata). The new species shows close affinities with Middle Jurassic faunas from Antarctica and offers important data on the taxonomy (notably the use of ornamentation characters), palaeobiogeography (as South America hosts the oldest-known fossils of this family) and evolution of the Gondwanan faunas. Other South American eosestheriid species are tentatively recognized. Menucoestheria is hypothesized to be the ancestral form of the Triassic–Jurassic Gondwanan eosestheriids.

They represent an indeterminate species of the extinct anhingid Macranhinga and a new genus and species of basal Anatidae Ankonetta larriestrai. The record of the giant darter Macranhinga constitutes the southernmost record for the family, and expands the known stratigraphic range of the genus, previously restricted to the upper Miocene. Based on an analysis of the fossil anhingid record from South America, we hypothesize that giant darters disappeared from South America in the early Pliocene due to climatic deterioration, regression of marine and freshwater environments, the arrival of placental carnivorous mammals, and also probably by competition with phalacrocoracid cormorants. The new anatid Ankonetta is based on an incomplete but informative tarsometatarsus, with superficial similarities to extant Dendrocygna. A brief overview of several fossil ducks from the Patagonian Cenozoic concludes that most pre-Pliocene examples belong to non-anatine taxa, indicating that plesiomorphic ducks were the dominant anseriforms in those times, a pattern also evident on other continents.",

Its geology includes the Tupuangi Formation, dated as Motuan to Teratan (late Albian to Santonian) on the basis of palynology. Samples of Tupuangi Formation mudstone yielded leaf cuticle assemblages dominated by araucarian and podocarp conifers and locally by angiosperms. The 12 distinguishable conifer taxa include a new species of Araucaria, A. rangiauriaensis, and the extinct genera Eromangia, Kakahuia (both Podocarpaceae), Otwayia (Cheirolepidiaceae), Paahake (Taxodiaceae or Taxaceae) and possibly Katikia (Podocarpaceae). Ginkgo and two types of dicotyledonous angiosperm cuticle are present. Based on the absence of bennettitaleans and rarity of Ginkgo, a Turonian or slightly younger age is inferred, making the Pitt Island assemblage the first Turonian plant macrofossils documented from New Zealand. The fossils provide a window into southern high-latitude (polar) vegetation of the mid-Cretaceous. Conifer charcoal (probably of Podocarpaceae) is locally abundant and suggests that fire was an important part of the ecosystem. A broad analogy with modern boreal conifer-deciduous angiosperm forests is suggested although clearly with warmer temperatures.",

    "abstract": "A palynological study of uppermost Maastrichtian to lower Paleocene marine strata from two stratigraphic sections in the Clarence Valley, Marlborough, New Zealand, revealed diverse organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages. One hundred and twelve samples were investigated and 86 dinocyst species were identified, from the two sections studied: Branch and Mead streams. Nine new species are described herein: Cerodinium nielsii, Impagidinium agremon, I. cavea, I. crouchiae, I. hannahii, Lejeunecysta kammae, Pyxidinopsis epakros, P. everriculum and P. meadensis. Stratigraphic correlations are achieved using nine new index species and eight cyst acme intervals, named A to H, integrated with foraminiferal datums and the radiolarian zonation for the South Pacific. The first occurrence of Carpatella septata combined with a high relative abundance of Diconidinium martianum characterizes the interval directly below the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary or uppermost part of the Manumiella druggii Zone. Based on the results from both sections, the earliest Paleocene Trithyrodinium evittii Zone is subdivided into the following intervals: Senoniasphaera inornata, Carpatella cornuta, Cassidium fragile and Cerodinium striatum subzones. The following dinocyst species first appear at or near the top of the T. evittii Zone: Alterbidinium pentaradiatum, Glaphyrocysta perforata, Habibacysta sp. cf. H. tectata, Kallosphaeridium brevibarbatum, Lejeunecysta kammae, Pyxidinopsis sp. cf. P. waipawaensis, Spiniferella cornuta and Tectatodinium meandriforme. The boundary between the T. evittii and the overlying Palaeocystodinium golzowense Zone was recorded only in the Mead Stream section where it is dated to ca 64.0 Ma. A high relative abundance of Isabelidinium cingulatum succeeded by the first occurrence of Isabelidinium bakeri, Deflandrea foveolata and D. delineata characterizes the lower to middle part of the early Paleocene P. golzowense Zone. The last consistent occurrence of P. pyrophorum is recorded within the upper part of radiolarian Zone RP3 corresponding to the middle part of the early Paleocene calcareous nannoplankton Zone NP3 (Early Teurian) or ca 63.7 Ma. The K–Pg boundary is not characterized by a mass extinction of dinoflagellates in the New Zealand sections. Instead, there is a marked change in cyst associations directly above the boundary and several new species appear in the lowermost Paleocene. Several typical latest Maastrichtian taxa have their last occurrences within the lowermost Paleocene corresponding to an interval of ca 0.5–0.7 Myrs after the K–Pg boundary.",

ISSN 0311-5518Morphological studies of South American alligatorids are scarce, and the phylogenetic relationships within Caimaninae are poorly understood. In this context, systematic revision and detailed morphological description of the enigmatic Argentinean Miocene caimanines are highly relevant. The current record is characterized by numerous species within the genus Caiman, although morphological disparity remains unclear. Here, we describe Caiman gasparinae sp. nov., which is one of the largest known Caiman species from the late Miocene of Argentina. Similar to other Caiman species and Melanosuchus, the new taxon has orbits larger than the infratemporal fenestrae and small supratemporal fenestrae that are not lost, as in Paleosuchus. Together with the absence of conspicuous rostral crests, the shape of the snout distinguishes C. gasparinae from Melanosuchus.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Paleocene flora from Seymour Island, Antarctica, first collected by Nordenskjöld on the Swedish South Polar Expedition (1901–1903), was described by Dusén (Citation1908) as having 87 leaf taxa making it one of the most diverse floras of this age in the Southern Hemisphere. The original descriptions of these leaf impressions included 37 pteridophytes and one conifer. Many species identified by Dusén were based on single fragmentary specimens. Major new collections housed at the British Antarctic Survey (Cambridge, UK), together with the original collections held at The Swedish Museum of Natural History, form the basis for a taxonomic revision of the flora. This paper concentrates on the pteridophytes and conifers. The diversity is considerably reduced from Dusén's estimates with just three ferns (Cladophlebis aemulans, Cladophlebis seymourensis, Sphenopteris angustiloba) and two conifers (Araucaria imponens, Elatocladus seymourensis) recognized.

Previous anatomical studies of E. riograndensis have focused mainly on cranial material and little is known about the morphology of its lower dentition or postdentary bones. We describe the first fairly complete postdentary series of the mandible of E. riograndensis and provide additional information on its lower dentition. The postdentary bones of E. riograndensis include a complex coronoid, an angular with a delicate reflected lamina and a stout retroarticular process of the articular, contrasting with the morphology reconstructed for Argentinean specimens, which possess a small retroarticular process. Apart from that, the postdentary bones do not differ significantly from those known for E. argentinus, a fact expected due to the great similarity between other skeletal features of these species. Furthermore, the lower postcanines of E. riograndensis have virtually the same structure as those of E. argentinus, with an approximate quadrangular shape in occlusal view. Moreover, the transverse cusp row is placed anteriorly and comprises a lingual and a buccal cusp, and the occlusal basin delimited by the four main cusps is relatively deep. The new material does not add any taxonomically diagnostic features to E. riograndensis. However, the fossils greatly improve our understanding of the anatomy of the Brazilian species.",

A new genus and species, Emwadea microcarpa Dettmann, Clifford & Peters, is established for ovulate/seed cones with helically arranged cone scales bearing a centrally positioned, inverted ovule from the basal Winton Formation (late Albian), Eromanga Basin, Queensland. The cones are small, prolate ellipsoidal (9.5–14 mm vertical axis, 6.3–8.7 mm transverse axis) with wedge-shaped cone scales bearing winged seeds attached adaxially to the scale only by tissues surrounding the vasculature entering the ovule. Ovuliferous tissue that is free from the cone scale extends distally from the chalaza; the seeds' lateral wings are derived from the integument. Foliage attached to the cones is spirally arranged, imbricate and with spreading and incurved bifacial blades with acute tips; stomata are arranged in longitudinal files and are confined to the adaxial surface. The cone organization testifies to placement within the Araucariaceae, and is morphologically more similar to Wollemia and Agathis than to Araucaria.

A new species of Scirrotherium Edmund & Theodor (Pampatheriidae) is described: S. carinatum. This genus was previously represented by a single species, S. hondaensis Edmund & Theodor, 1997, recorded from the middle Miocene (Laventan) of Colombia. Pampathere remains are common in the 'Conglomerado osífero' (late Miocene) of the Ituzaingó Formation in the Paraná River cliffs of Entre Ríos, Chubut (Argentina) and Acre (Brazil). All of them were referred to Kraglievichia paranense, and they are mostly osteoderms. However, only a few of these specimens are strictly consistent with that species. The new species described herein differs from S. hondaensis in having very thin osteoderms with more elaborate ornamentation. The movable band (or imbricate) osteoderms have a sculptured exposed surface and a single transverse row of anterior foramina; the lateral margins are wider and also bear foramina, and the longitudinal central elevation is long and proximally wide, and forms a posteriorly raised crest. This elevation is delimited by a fairly broad and shallow depression on each side, separating the marginal elevation from the longitudinal central one. The exposed surfaces of fixed (or fused) osteoderms bear large and deep anterior foramina, the longitudinal central elevation and delimiting depressions are very pronounced. This new species increases the known diversity of the pampatheres from the 'Conglomerado osífero'. Additionally, a new nomenclatural scheme for Pampatheriidae osteoderms is proposed.

ISSN 0311-5518.THE LAST 15 years has witnessed a blossoming of research on Australasian Mesozoic marine tetrapod fossils. Much of this work has focused on amniotes, particularly those from the prolific Lower Cretaceous (Aptian–Albian) Lagerstätten of the Eromanga Basin in central and eastern Australia, and Upper Cretaceous (Campanian–Maastrichtian) sequences of the North and South islands of New Zealand. However, rare and less popularized remains have also been found in Lower Triassic–mid-Cretaceous rocks from Australia, New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, and on the tectonically proximal landmasses of New Caledonia and Timor. Currently identified taxa include estuarine–paralic rhytidostean, brachyopid, capitosaurian and trematosaurian temnospondyls from the earliest Triassic (Induan–Olenekian), Middle–Late Triassic (Anisian–Norian) eosauropterygians, and mixosaurian, shastasaurian and euichthyosaurian ichthyosaurians, Early–Middle Jurassic (Sinemurian–Bajocian) ichthyosaurians, together with plesiosauroid and rhomaleosaurid-like plesiosaurians, and diverse Early (Aptian–Albian) through to Late Cretaceous (Campanian–Maastrichtian) elasmosaurid, leptocleidid, polycotylid, probable cryptoclidid and pliosaurid plesiosaurians, as well as ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurians, sea turtles incorporating protostegids, and mosasaurid squamates. This faunal succession evidences almost continuous occupation of southern high-palaeolatitude seas, and repeated endemic diversifications (including nascent members of some key lineages) amongst emigrant cosmopolitan clades. The primary dispersal routes are likely to have been peri-Gondwanan, with coastal migrations along the western Tethys and polar margins of the Panthalassan Ocean. However, augmentation by increasing continental fragmentation and seaway corridor connectivity probably occurred from the Middle Jurassic to Late Cretaceous. Latest Cretaceous mosasaurid and elasmosaurid taxa also reveal regional affinities with the emergent western Pacific and Weddellian austral bioprovinces. The extreme rarity, or complete absence, of many major groups prevalent elsewhere in Gondwana (e.g., tanystropheids, Triassic sauropterygians, bothremydid marine turtles, thalattosuchians and dyrosaurid crocodylomorphs) is conspicuous, and might be related to stratigraphical/collecting biases, or the predominantly higher-palaeolatitude, cooler-water Mesozoic palaeogeography of the Australasian region. Although the burgeoning record is substantial, much still awaits discovery and adequate documentation; thus Australasia is still one of the most exciting prospects for future insights into the global history of Mesozoic marine tetrapods.Benjamin P.

Triglypta eedemtensis is ornamented mainly with puncta and a punctate fine reticulum; radial lirae occur only on two or three growth bands near the venter. The small spinicaudatan Triglypta is a common component of the Middle Jurassic Euestheria ziliujingensis fauna and Sinokontikia fauna, and is a typical taxon in the Middle Jurassic lacustrine sequences of northern Hebei and the Junggar and Turpan basins of the Xinjiang Autonomous District of China; however, it does not occur in stratigraphically higher units elsewhere. Therefore, the age of the Eedemt Formation should be considered Middle Jurassic rather than Early Cretaceous. The Eedemt Formation is much older than the Early Cretaceous Shinekhudag Formation in the Shine Khudag area of southeast Mongolia.本文描述了两个针尾类种:Triglypta eedemtensis Li sp. nov. 和 Dundgobiestheria mandalgobiensis Li gen. et sp. nov.。该工作基于用扫描电子显微镜对出露于蒙古东南部Dundgobi省Khootiin Khotgor煤矿区的Eedemt组的纸层状黑色页岩中采集的标本进行的(SEM)成像。Triglypta eedemtensis 的主要装饰是疹点和点状细网;径向条脊只出现在靠近腹侧两或三个增长带上。小型针尾类Triglypta是中侏罗世Euestheria ziliujingensis动物群和Sinokontikia动物群的共同分子,是河北省北部和新疆地区准噶尔盆地和吐鲁番盆地的中侏罗世湖相序列的典型类群; 然而,它不会出现在其它地区地层序列上更高的地层单元中。因此,Eedemt组的时代应被视为中侏罗世,而不是早白垩世。Eedemt组比蒙古东南部Shine Khudag区的早白垩世地层Shinekhudag组老得多。Key words: Jurassic spinicaudatansConchostracansclam shrimpstaxonomybiostratigraphylacustrine depositsDundgobi ProvinceMongolia.

Alcheringa 38, 155–169. ISSN 0311–5518.New palaeopteran and neopteran insects are described from Moscovian impression fossils of the Pas-de-Calais Basin in northern France. Spilaptera splendens sp. nov. (Palaeodictyoptera) is based on new forewing venation characters including a well-developed anal bar in the form of a cuticular reinforcement extending from the anal area to the radial stem, a feature previously unknown in this genus. This character was also confirmed after re-examination of S. libelluloides. The discovery of a wing part with a large anal fan supports the presence of a gigantic palaeodictyopteran that can be assigned to Homoiopteridae. Based on a petiolate wing, Jacquesoudardia magnifica gen. et sp. nov. represents a small damselfly-like odonatopteran that was probably predatory on small arthropods and coexisted with larger meganeurid species such as Gallotupus oudardi from the same locality. The discovery of Paolia sp. (Paoliidae), known previously from the Bashkirian of Indiana (USA) and South Limbourg (the Netherlands), extends the distribution and stratigraphic range of the genus. Characterized by a short ScP, Aviogramma gracilis gen. et sp. nov. is the second member of Caloneurodea from the Pas-de-Calais Basin after Pruvostiella lecomtei (Pruvost). Aviocladus pectinatus gen. et sp. nov. and Aviohapaloptera bethouxi gen. et sp. nov. are both assigned to Archaeorthoptera. Aviocladus pectinatus, a member of Cnemidolestodea, preserves a venation pattern that allows restoration of Tococladus to Archaeorthoptera. Aviohapaloptera has strongly similar venation to Hapaloptera, known from Mazon Creek (USA), in bearing a pectinate CuPb, CuA+CuPa with few posterior branches, a narrow costal area and radial posterior (RP) with few branches. In addition, we restore Narkeminidae stat. rest. and separate it from Proedischiidae. These new fossils demonstrate that the insect fauna from the Pas-de-Calais Basin was highly diverse with links to Bashkirian/Moscovian assemblages in Euramerica, such as the Mazon Creek (Illinois, USA) entomofauna.Jakub Prokop [jprokop@natur.cuni.cz], Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Viničná 7, CZ-128 44, Praha 2, Czech Republic.

(Palaeodictyoptera)的建立基于新前翅脉特征, 包括发育良好的肛竿。肛竿的外形为从肛区延伸到径向茎的表皮加厚, 此特征以前在该属未知, 后通过复检S. libelluloides的同样特征才得以证实。翼部发现有大的肛区扇形结构证实大型古网翅类 的存在。它可被归为Homoiopteridae。根据叶柄翼, Jacquesoudardia magnifica gen. et sp. nov.代表一个小豆娘状蜻蜓翅类, 可能捕食小节肢动物, 与较大的meganeurid物种如Gallotupus oudardi 共生于同一地点 。 Paolia sp. (Paoliidae)的发现将该属的分布和地层范围扩展了, 以前认为它只来自印第安纳州的巴什基尔(美国)和南方林堡(荷兰)。通过短ScP特点, Aviogramma gracilis gen. et sp. nov.是Pas-de-Calais盆地中自Pruvostiella lecomtei (Pruvost)之后的Caloneurodea的第二个成员。 Aviocladus pectinatus gen. et sp. nov 和Aviohapaloptera bethoux gen. et sp. nov 均归为Archaeorthoptera 。 Cnemidolestodea的成员之一, Aviocladus pectinatus, 保存了叶脉模式, 使得我们将Tococladus重新归入Archaeorthoptera 。Mazon Creek(美国)的 Aviohapaloptera具有与Hapaloptera很相似的脉型, 具有齿状CuPb、带少许后枝的CuA +CuPa、狭窄的缘区和带少许分支的径向后部(RP)。此外, 我们恢复了Narkeminidae stat. rest. ,将它从Proedischiidae分开。这些新化石表明, 从Pas-de-Calais盆地的昆虫动物群是高度多样化的, 与欧美Bashkirian/Moscovian组合如Mazon Creek(美国伊利诺伊州) 的昆虫动物群有关系。Key words: Palaeodictyopteraodonatopterapaoliidaarchaeorthopteracaloneurodealate CarboniferousMoscovian AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Dr Stephen McLoughlin (Swedish Museum of Natural History, Sweden), Dr Andrew J.

ISSN 0311-5518.Seven conodont biozones are recognized in the Upper Ordovician of Australia. The Pygodus anserinus, Belodina compressa and Phragmodus undatus–Tasmanognathus careyi biozones are successively represented in the Sandbian. Although the Erismodus quadridactylus Biozone of the late Sandbian North America Midcontinent succession was previously recognized in the Stokes Siltstone of the Amadeus Basin and the Mithaka Formation of the Georgina Basin in central-north Australia, we argue for a middle–late Darriwilian age for these two units. Four conodont biozones, from oldest to youngest the Taoqupognathus philipi, T. blandus, T. tumidus–Protopanderodus insculptus and Aphelognathus grandis biozones, are established in the Katian of eastern Australia. Taoqupognathus species are particularly useful in correlation of the lower–middle Katian successions of eastern Australia with contemporary rocks in other parts of eastern Gondwana and peri-Gondwana, such as with the three major terranes of North and South China and Tarim. These regions, together with Sibumasu and eastern Australia, were part of the Australasian Superprovince during the Late Ordovician, with a strong palaeobiogeographic identity signalled by domination of Taoqupognathus, Tasmanognathus and Yaoxianognathus. Longstanding difficulties for precise correlation with the well-established North American Midcontinent or Baltoscandian successions in the Late Ordovician, owing mainly to strong endemism of the Australian faunas particularly from shallow-water settings, have been resolved by integration of regional conodont biostratigraphic schemes. The conodont biozonation of the Australian Upper Ordovician reviewed herein also provides a crucial chronological reference for better constraining the temporal and spatial range of Late Ordovician tectonostratigraphic events across the intracratonic basins of northern and western Australia and orogenic belts of eastern Australia.Yong Yi Zhen* [yong-yi.zhen@industry.nsw.gov.au] and Ian G.

The fossil is a well-preserved anterior limb, which shares with Vegasaurus molyi from the upper Maastrichtian of Antarctica, a concave to flat anterior margin of the humeral shaft, and with Vegasaurus molyi and Aphrosaurus furlongi from the upper Maastrichtian of California, a well-defined depression on the anterior margin of the ventral surface of the humeral shaft.

Fifty-two species belonging to 30 genera are recognized, and seven are new: Arcuaria hebukesarensis sp. nov., Bairdia shaerbuertiensis sp. nov., Cribroconcha honggulelengensis sp. nov., Microchelinella bulongourensis sp. nov., M. hoxtolgayensis sp. nov., Pribylites wulankeshunensis sp. nov. and P. junggarensis sp. nov. The ostracod fauna indicates a probable late Frasnian age for the lower member of the Hongguleleng Formation, and the Frasnian/Famennian boundary may exist in the basal part of the formation. The ostracod assemblages are referable to the Eifelian Mega-Assemblage, incorporating both the palaeocopid and smooth-podocopid associations. The fauna implies deposition in a nearshore–offshore environment during a transgression when the lower member of the Hongguleleng Formation was being deposited in western Junggar.Junjun Song [hnlisa@126.com], State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, PR China; CR2P, MNHN-UPMC- CNRS, Sorbonne Universités, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, T46-56, E.5, case 104, 75252 Paris cedex 05, France; Sylvie Crasquin [sylvie.crasquin@upmc.fr], CR2P, MNHN-UPMC-CNRS, Sorbonne Université, Universités Pierre et Marie Curie, T46-56, E.5, case 104, 75252 Paris cedex 05, France; Yiming Gong* [ymgong@cug.edu.cn], State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, PR China.",

ISSN 0311-5518Evaluation of abundant insect fossils from the Early Pennsylvanian (Namurian) Tupo Formation of northern China (Xiaheyan locality, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) enabled description of a new megasecopteran, i.e., Brodioptera sinensis sp. nov. and emendation of Brodiopteridae. Brodioptera sinensis is defined principally on wing venation characters and darkly pigmented wing apices, but a few have hyaline wing membranes possibly reflecting freshly emerged imagoes or subimagoes without fully developed coloration. The large assemblage of 54 specimens enabled documentation of intra-specific variability in wing venation. In addition, the new species reveals the detailed morphology of the haustellate mouthparts with conspicuous elongated stylets, and external copulatory organs that, previously, were poorly documented or unknown. The male and female external genitalia are similar to members of Protohymenidae (Megasecoptera) and Asthenohymenidae (Diaphanopterodea). Brodioptera sinensis is related to Brodioptera stricklani and Brodioptera cumberlandensis both known from localities in Euramerica suggesting faunal exchange occurred during the Bashkirian. Moreover, based on our analysis of veinal characters and re-examination of the holotype of Sylvohymen pintoi Brauckmann known from Namurian of Hagen-Vorhalle (Germany), we propose transferring this taxon to Brodiopteridae as Brodioptera pintoi comb. nov. Despite the different palaeoclimatic conditions in Euroamerica and Gondwanaland, we assume that Brodiopteridae are closely related to Xenopteridae (type genus: Xenoptera) known solely from South America because these groups have similar venation patterns and were contemporaneous.Martina Pecharová [martina.pecharova@natur.cuni.cz] Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Viničná 7, CZ-128 44, Praha 2, Czech Republic; Dong Ren [rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn] Key Lab of Insect Evolution & Environmental Changes, College of Life Science, Capital Normal University, Beijing 100048, PR China; Jakub Prokop [jprokop@natur.cuni.cz] Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Viničná 7, CZ-128 44, Praha 2, Czech Republic.",

ISSN 0311-5518Megafossils from the Ediacaran Period (635–541 Ma) have been controversial in part because many are mere impressions in coarse-grained rocks. New examination of these fossils in petrographic thin-sections reveals various features that inform understanding of the biological affinities of these problematic fossils. Material examined includes Dickinsonia costata from the Ediacara Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite in South Australia, Ernietta plateauensis from the Kliphoek Member of Namibia, Ivesheadia lobata from the Drook Formation of Newfoundland, Charnia antecedens and Charniodiscus spinosus from the Mistaken Point Formation of Newfoundland, Aspidella terranovica from the Fermeuse Formation of Newfoundland, and Nemiana simplex from the Mogilev Formation of Ukraine and the Verkovka Formation of Russia. Three characteristics stand out for all but Nemiana. First, these fossils were remarkably resistant to burial compaction, as originally inferred from depth gauge measurements of overlying moulds, and here confirmed by thin-sections perpendicular to bedding planes. Second, thin-sections reveal a construction of micrometric branching elongate structures forming millimetric hollow elongate structures in fractal arrangements. Third, some of the fossils are asymmetric bifacial or unifacial, with a thick finished upper wall but lower wall thin or non-existent and attached to elongate structures downward into sediment. Compaction-resistant fossils with asymmetric histological layering are most like crustose and fruticose lichens fortified with chitin. In contrast, non-resistant impressions in the tops of beds filled by overlying cross-bedded sediment, as in Nemiana, preserve no informative histology and are similar to lake balls and microbial colonies.Gregory J.

Burmahemiphlebia zhangi is the first record of Hemiphlebiidae from this amber, although the family was cosmopolitan during the Mesozoic. It can be readily distinguished from all other members of Hemiphlebiidae in having very short MP and CuA veins, and in its rectangular discoidal cell. The new fossils support the view that hemiphlebiid damselflies were one of the dominant groups of Zygoptera during the Mesozoic. Palaeodysagrion cretacicus is the first dysagrionid damselfly from Burmese amber and the second Mesozoic representative of this predominantly Paleogene group. It differs from other members of Dysagrionidae in having a unique elongate discoidal cell.

    "abstract": "The distinctive QANTAS ‘flying kangaroo’ motif of Australia’s national airline signifies what many people regard as the pinnacle of kangaroo evolution—a large-bodied marsupial specialized for endurance-hopping. However, while almost all extant macropodoids (the crown group including kangaroos) use hopping gaits to some extent, the fossil record reveals that the locomotory capabilities of extinct macropodoids were comparatively diverse. The earliest recognized Oligocene–middle Miocene macropodoids probably employed quadrupedal bounding, climbing and slower speed hopping as their primary modes of locomotion. Yet, all were apparently small-bodied (<12 kg), with larger-bodied (>20 kg) forms not appearing until the late Miocene coincident with increasing aridity and the spread of openly vegetated habitats. Hopping is functionally problematic at larger body sizes. Consequently, the later radiation of macropodids (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives) achieved an optimal mass for efficient higher-speed hopping at ∼35 kg, with a theorized extreme limit of ∼140–160 kg. Modern kangaroos otherwise approach the peak mass range for such gaits at ∼50–90 kg, with the gigantic Pliocene–Pleistocene species of Protemnodon (‘giant wallabies’) at ∼100–160 kg likely being predominantly quadrupedal, and sthenurines (short-faced kangaroos) at ∼50–250 kg seemingly using bipedal striding. Here, we review the fossil evidence of macropodoid locomotion over the last ∼25 million years, and present preliminary analyses of limb bone and tarsal metric data. These indicate that the higher-speed endurance-hopping typical of modern large-bodied kangaroos was probably rare or absent in all but a few crown macropodoid lineages. The intrinsic gait variability of macropodoids has therefore diminished with Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions. As a result, the famous QANTAS ‘flying kangaroo’ actually depicts only one of what was once many successful locomotory strategies employed by macropodoids to conquer a range of terrestrial and arboreal habitats.Christine M.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Taebaeksan Basin occupies the central-eastern part of the Korean peninsula and was a low-relief shallow marine carbonate shelf on which the Cambro-Ordovician Choson Supergroup was deposited. In the Taebaeksan Basin trilobites are among the most dominant fossil groups in the Lower Ordovician, but they become less important in Middle Ordovician faunal assemblages. The Early Ordovician trilobite faunas of the Taebaeksan Basin are characterised by the common occurrence of pandemic genera such as Jujuyaspis, Leiostegium, Asaphellus, Protopliomerops, Hystricurus, Apatokephalus, Shumardia, Asaphopsoides, and Kayseraspis. Biogeographically significant trilobite taxa include Yosimuraspis, Dikelokephalina, Koraipsis, and Chosenia. These Ordovician trilobite faunas, which thrived in shallow marine environments, show a remarkable similarity with faunas from North China, implying that the Taebaeksan Basin was connected through contiguous shallow waters to North China. These Sino-Korean faunas exhibit a close biogeographic connection with Australian faunas, with which they share some endemic genera, whereas they are more distantly related to the faunas of South China, South America, and North America. Based on these palaeobiogeographical features, it is suggested that in the early Palaeozoic much of the present Korean peninsula including the Taebaeksan Basin belonged to the Sino-Korean block, while part of the peninsula was derived from the Yangtze block.

Segregation of fossil and extant pollen types has been effected on apertural characters of which six states have been identified. Apertures are colpoid, poroid or porate.

In the Otway Basin fossil record, triporate apertures appear earlier than tricolpoids, triporoids and biporates; and diversity levels of proteaceous pollen are higher than reported from elsewhere implying the region may have been a diversification centre during Campanian and Maastrichtian times. Represented among the fossil pollen are types that conform with pollen of extant Proteaceae: Adenanthos, Beauprea, Beaupreopsis, and Stirlingia (subfamily Proteoideae); Persoonia (subfamily Persoonioideae); Carnarvonia (subfamily Carnarvonioideae); and Bleasdalia, Grevillea, Knightia, Macadamia and Telopea (subfamily Grevillioideae). The Late Cretaceous pollen record thereby implies the presence of sclerophyll and rainforest taxa in a vegetation which was composed of diverse podocarps (Dacrydium, Dacrycarpus, Lagarostrobos, Podocarpus, Microcachrys), araucarians, and a range of angiosperms (Nothofagus, Gunnera, Ilex, Ascarina, Callitriche, Trimeniaceae, Winteraceae, Ranunculaceae and possibly Epacridaceae). Thirty-one pollen species are described and referred to five genera, of which Lewalanipollis is new. New species include Lewalanipollis senectus, L. trycheros, Propylipollis areolatus, P. crotonoides, Proteacidites cooksoniae and Proteacidites variverrucatus.",

The silicified specimens show features of the pith, primary xylem and successive rings of secondary xylem and phloem. The most striking characteristic is the anomalous secondary growth, represented by secondary xylem bounded by arcs of secondary phloem probably derived from successive repositioned cambia. Cuneumxylon has two kinds of unusual centrifugal secondary growth. The first shows unequal activity of different portions of the cambium on the circumference of the axes; the consequent restriction of cambial activity to certain restricted areas develops wedged stems, which often split. The second produces polyxylic stems following supernumerary cambial activity. As in extant plants growing in arid regions, the included phloem and the associated parenchyma may have had functional value avoiding desiccation of the outer tissues of the stem during droughts. Anatomical features of other Corystospermaceae were used to determine systematic affinities and to establish relationships among medullosans, corystosperms and cycads.

Such a mosaic character combination suggests a sister-group relationship between Enantiornithes and Ornithurae. Derived features of the pectoral girdle are here considered as diagnostic for a major avian clade, the Ornithopectae, comprising all known birds other than Archaeopteryx. The combination of derived and primitive traits in the fore and hind limbs and their girdles in early ornithopectines reflects mosaic evolution, with flight-related modifications of the fore limb and pectoral girdle preceding those in the hind limb and pelvic girdle.",

Libocedrus mesibovii is based on an ovulate cone, while L. jacksonii and L. morrisonii are based on vegetative remains. L. mesibovii and L. jacksonii are found in the same deposit, and may represent different organs of the same species, but this could not be demonstrated. These species clearly belong to Libocedrus, which is now restricted to New Zealand and New Caledonia, but are distinct from all extant species considered. Austrocedrus tasmanica is based on ovulate cones, and is distinct from the single extant species, which occurs in South America. None of the three genera have been previously reported as fossils outside the range of extant species. The presence of these genera in the Tasmanian Tertiary signals this region as an important centre of diversity for the Cupressaceae at that time.

Low- to moderate-diversity faunas of lingulate brachiopods are reported for the first time from the Lower to Middle Ordovician Lashkarak Formation of the Eastern Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. Twenty-three species of 20 genera referable to four successive lingulate brachiopod assemblages are systematically described, including Aipyotreta conferta sp. nov., Ghavidelia damghanensis gen. et sp. nov. and Thysanotos multispinulosus sp. nov. The occurrence of Alichovia and Acrotreta, and the early appearance of Biernatia suggest Baltic affinities of the fauna, but scaphelasmatids and Myotreta are missing in the Iranian section. The opportunistic Thysanotos – Leptembolon Association appears in Eastern Alborz in the lower Floian prior to the onset of the carbonate sedimentation.

This represents the earliest record of antiarchs from the Australian continent. An Emsian age, based on correlations with the Mulga Downs Group in the Darling Basin, makes this the earliest recorded antiarch occurrence outside of the south China province. All specimens are of small size and may be juvenile. Some resemblances to Pterichthyodes are noted, but the material is insufficient for formal taxonomic treatment. The structure of the asterolepidoid pectoral fin is discussed, and it is concluded that this is a shared primitive feature of euantiarchs generally. It is suggested that the primary distribution of asterolepidoid antiarchs did not include south China, and some implications of a vicariance explanation for the origin of bothriolepidoids in south China, and of asterolepidoids elsewhere, are briefly considered.",

    "abstract": "Lower Cambrian sediments in the Arrowie and Stansbury Basins were deposited on a rifting continental platform and contain abundant acritarchs, trace fossils, small shelly fossils, archaeocyaths, trilobites and brachiopods. Generally, faunas and acritarchs are abundant in transgressive and highstand deposits, but less common in lowstand fluvial deposits, responding both to sedimentary environments and preservational conditions. Seven acritarch Assemblage Zones are recognised in the lowest Cambrian to Toyonian sediments of South Australia. Assemblage Zone 1 embraces the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, but a dramatic increase of spinose acritarchs (Assemblage Zone 2) is observed around 1 m above the first appearance of the trace fossil Rusophycus. Assemblage Zone 3 occurs in transgressive siltstones during deposition of the uppermost Parachilna Formation and is marked by the first appearance of several taxa, which are widespread and well correlated in South Australia. Assemblage Zones 4, 5 and 6 are dominated by Skiagia; the appearance of S. ornata followed by S. ciliosa in Zones 4 and 5, respectively, indicates correlation with the nominal acritarch zones on the East European Platform and concurrent Schmidtiellus mickwitzi and Holmia kjerulfi trilobite zones, and the Qiongzhusi Formation in southern China. Assemblage Zone 7 encompasses a major acritarch decrease in South Australia during the late early Cambrian regression and 'red-beds' deposition. Continuous occurrences of acritarch genera Skiagia, Ceratophyton and Corollasphaeridium during the early Cambrian provide valuable evidence of evolutionary development, and therefore are reliable for biostratigraphic zonation. The integration of biostratigraphy and unconformity-bounded sequence stratigraphy provides more precise intercontinental correlation.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of foraminiferids within Aptian-Albian marine deposits of the Laura, Carpentaria, Eromanga, and Surat Basins in Queensland is described. The foraminiferal distribution patterns are largely a reflection of environmental differences which existed within the basins. Among the benthonic foraminiferids, two major faunal associations are recognized: the Ammobaculites association reflecting hyposaline, cool, shallow water conditions; and the Marssonella association indicating normal marine, open continental shelf environments. As the faunal content of these associations is markedly different, separate time-stratigraphic zonations are proposed: the Ammobaculites association is divided into the Textularia cushmani zone (early Aptian), T. cushmani-Bigenerina pitmani zone (late Aptian), B. pitmani zone (late Aptian), B. pitmani-Riyadhella crespinae zone (early Albian), and R. crespinae zone (early-late Albian); the Marssonella association contains the Anomalinoides intermedia zone (early-middle Albian in Queensland), and the A. cenomanica zone (late Albian in Queensland). Planktonic foraminiferids, which occur with both benthonic associations, are used to correlate the benthonic zonal schemes, and are themselves zoned separately: Hedbergella planispira zone (early-middle Albian), H. infracretacea zone (middle-early late Albian), and the H. delrioensis zone (late Albian). International stage correlations are based on certain foraminiferids and associated ammonites. The distribution of foraminiferids in Queensland during the late Early Cretaceous suggests that 1, climate exerted a uniform influence over the region; 2, cool, hyposaline, shallow water conditions prevailed over much of Queensland; 3, open marine shelf conditions (of normal salinity) existed during the Albian in the Laura and northeastern Carpentaria Basins; and 4, during the Albian, at least, there was a northern seaway to the open ocean.",

They also contain the oldest archaeological material, including human burials and cremations, in Australia, but the remains of extinct Pleistocene mammal species are extremely rare. At Menindee and other lakes along the Darling River, 150 km to the west, lunettes of apparently similar age contain both archaeological material and abundant fossils of extinct species. The rarity of such fossils along the Willandra Lakes has been cited as evidence that the extinction of the Pleistocene species occurred before 30,000 BP. However, a comparison of the Darling and Willandra sites in terms of taphonomy and palaeoecology leads to the conclusion that these sites do not yet provide any definitive evidence for the time or causes of the Pleistocene extinctions.",

The univariate studies show that three parameters for Cycloclypeus (pc, Spc4+5, log D1 of O'Herne & van der Vlerk, 1971) are of equal biostratigraphic value; for Heterostegina two new ones (N0 and S4+5) appear useful for correlation, but need to be tested over a wider geographic area; for Miogypsina, which is rare and has a limited stratigraphic range in the areas studied, only parameters X and V are useful for taxonomic and biostratigraphic purposes; for Lepidocyclina (Eulepidina) both A (of van der Vlerk, 1959a,b) and the new parameter LA appear to be useful for correlation, but a realistic appraisal of these must await detailed studies elsewhere. For L. (Nephrolepidina) two new parameters (E,F) and those of van der Vlerk (1959a,b — parameters A and B), and O'Herne & van der Vlerk (1971 — parameter dc) have been used; of these F is the most useful, with B being of only local usefulness within Australia, and A, dc and E being similarly useful only in New Zealand. Multivariate studies with L. (Nephrolepidina) show that parameter F is largely responsible for the groupings obtained. Cycloclypeus and Lepidocyclina (Nephrolepidina) seem to be the only larger foraminiferids suitable for biostratigraphic correlation within Australia. The biometric results suggest that the rates of evolution of the New Zealand larger foraminiferids were different from those of the Australian region.",

Alcheringa 32, 199–222. ISSN 0311-5518. A well-preserved late Changhsingian radiolarian fauna (15 species attributed to 12 genera) is recorded from the upper part of the Talung Formation, Chaohu, Anhui Province, South China. This radiolarian fauna includes Entactinia itsukaichiensis, Entactinia sashidai, Triaenosphaera minutus, Hegleria mammilla, ?Wuyia dongpanica, Tetraspongodiscus stauracanthus, Tetrapaurinella discoidalis, Klaengspongus formosus, Klaengspongus spinosus, Paroertlispongus fontainei, Ormistonella elegans, Quadricaulis inflata, Ishigaum trifustis, Ishigaum obesum, and Foremanhelena robusta. This fauna is more diverse than the fauna from the Meishan section in Zhejiang Province but is less diverse than the fauna of the Dongpan section in Guangxi Province, South China. The new fauna incorporates a higher percentage of Latentifistularia forms than the fauna from the Meishan section, but incorporates a lower percentage of Latentifistularia and Albaillellaria forms than that from the Dongpan section. These differences could be due to deposition of the Chaohu sediments in deeper waters than at Meishan, but in shallower waters than at Dongpan.",

This absence has been interpreted to be the result of strong provincialism during this interval and geographic clines have been demonstrated between an Equatorial Warm Water Province (EWWP) and a North Cool Water Province (NCWP). Results from a succession of deep-water limestones in the Pingxiang section, southwestern Guangxi, China, suggest that the distribution of warm-water and cool-water lineages may not in all cases be separated over large geographic scales, but may be segregated in some areas by local changes of water-mass temperature or depth and, in some cases, fossil assemblages from these lineages may be mixed. Two contemporaneous gondolellid evolutionary lineages are represented within warm-water and cool-water conodont assemblages from limestones spanning the Cisuralian–Guadalupian (C–G) boundary in the Pingxiang section, southwestern Guangxi, China. The warm-water conodont lineage begins with the first occurrence (FO) of Mesogondolella saraciniensis, followed by Mesogondolella siciliensis, then M. idahoensis lamberti and finally Mesogondolella pingxiangensis sp. nov. The latter new species lacks serration, but has a platform outline and lateral profile similar to J. nankingensis nankingensis found elsewhere in South China and they may be closely related. Although less common in the samples, a coeval cool-water lineage begins with M. idahoensis idahoensis and develops successively with the evolution of J. nankingensis gracilis; serration is also lacking in the latter species. The lack of serration on these forms is ascribed to some form of environmental control. The contemporaneous appearance of Mesogondolella pingxiangensis and Jinogondolella nankingensis gracilis is correlated with the C–G boundary. This correlation is supported by the co-occurrence of the zonal indices of the cool-water lineage with important zonal radiolarians in a C–G boundary section at Dachongling, southeastern Guangxi. Here the radiolarian assemblages are assigned to the Albaillella foremanae Zone, Pseudoalbaillella globosa Zone and P. fusiformis Zone in ascending order. The first appearance of J. nankingensis gracilis within this succession defines the base of the Guadalupian to be at the base of the P. globosa Zone. Conodont correlation between carbonate ramps of platform margins and radiolarian-bearing pelagic environments has determined that the first appearance of J. nankingensis gracilis precisely defines the base-Guadalupian boundary in the cool-water settings.",

A palynological investigation of strata exposed along Mangahouanga Stream and of transported boulders hosting vertebrate fossils reveals well-preserved assemblages dominated by terrestrial pollen and spores but also including marine dinoflagellate cysts in some samples. The palynofacies are strongly dominated by wood fragments including charcoal; one outcrop sample and the sample taken from a boulder hosting plesiosaur vertebrae contain entirely terrestrially derived palynoassemblages, suggesting a freshwater habitat for at least some of the plesiosaurs. The host unit spans the Santonian to lowermost Maastrichtian, while the key pollen taxa Nothofagidites senectus and Tricolpites lilliei, together with the dinocyst Isabelidinium pellucidum and the megaspore Grapnelispora evansii, indicate a late Campanian to early Maastrichtian age for the fossiliferous boulders. The palynoflora indicates a mixed local vegetation dominated by podocarp conifers and angiosperms with a significant tree-fern subcanopy. The presence of taxa with modern temperate distributions, such as Nothofagus (southern beech), Proteaceae and Cyatheaceae (tree-ferns), indicates a mild-temperate climate and lack of severe winter freezing during the latest Cretaceous, providing an ecosystem that most probably made it possible for polar dinosaurs to overwinter in this part of the world.",

Based on several features such as the position of the pneumatic foramen and the particular shape and proportions of those elements, they possibly are members of, or closely related to, the Anhangueridae.

Microdictyon plates are primarily known from single, isolated, perforated phosphatic sclerites; only one species (M. sinicum) from the Chengjiang Lagerstätte is known from soft-bodied preservation of the complete organism. The isolated plates from South Australia display a wide range of morphologies potentially reflecting: 1, considerable diversification within the group at this time; 2, extensive intraspecific morphological variation; 3, different plate morphotypes along the trunk of the animal; or 4, significant ontogenetic variation in successive growth stages. The South Australian specimens are similar to several individual sclerites described from other Cambrian palaeocontinents, but appear closest to faunas described from South China.

    "abstract": "Abstract Several traces of biological interaction were found on penguin bones from the basal levels (Aquitanian) of the Miocene Gaiman Formation in the lower Chubut valley of the Provincia del Chubut, Argentina. The fossil-bearing beds were deposited in littoral to sublittoral environments within sediments of mostly pyroclastic origin. We interpret many traces to have been produced by predators and/or scavengers while the penguins were still in a breeding area. Many bones show cracking marks due to aerial exposure. The material is disarticulated as is usual in recent breeding areas. Potential predators were coeval terrestrial mammals, most probably marsupial carnivores. After a marine transgression, these bones were buried or exposed on the sea bottom where they could be colonized by algae, sponges, cnidarians, and other benthic organisms. We identified sponge borings in several bones. Other traces are interpreted to have been produced by echinoderms feeding on sponges or algae. No evidence of other invertebrate predators such as muricid or naticid gastropods, or decapods was found. Finally, other traces appear to have been generated by shark and possibly teleostean vertebrates feeding on epibionts. One coracoid is interpreted to have been marked by a shark that is common in the Gaiman Formation, the carcharhiniform Galeocerdo aduncus. From an ethological (Seilacherian) classification, traces on bones from the Gaiman Formation include Domichnia (sponge perforations), Praedichnia (terrestrial marsupials, sharks, teleosteans) and Pasichnia (echinoderms). Remarkably, remains of marine organisms with skeletons made of calcium carbonate are very poorly preserved in the Gaiman Formation. Only large oysters, sparse shell fragments, skeletal moulds, and bioturbation is evident. The fossil assemblage is mainly composed of phosphatic (e.g. teeth, bones, crustacean parts) and siliceous (sponge spicules, diatoms) remains.

First fossil record of amiid fishes (Halecomorphi, Amiiformes, Amiidae) from the Late Cretaceous of Uberaba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Alcheringa, 1–9. ISSN 0311-5518. The first fossil amiid fishes (Halecomorphi, Amiiformes) from the Late Cretaceous Marília Formation (Bauru Group) at Uberaba County, Triângulo Mineiro region (Minas Gerais State, Brazil), are described. The material includes some partial maxillae, a dermopterotic, a cleithrum, several vertebral centra and teeth. Features such as the absence of a supramaxillary notch on the dorsal edge of the maxilla, a wide and deep pit on the maxilla for the articulation of the premaxilla, anterior portion of the maxilla with a sub-circular cross-section, teeth with acrodine cup with strong mesial and distal keels, among others, permit confident referral of the material to the Subfamily Vidalamiine (Amiidae), previously recognized in Lower Cretaceous strata of northeasthern Brazil. These specimens constitute the first Late Cretaceous record of this group in Brazil and one of the few in South America. Agustín G.

    "abstract": "The Paleocene flora from Seymour Island, Antarctica, is one of the most diverse floras of this age in the Southern Hemisphere. First collected on the Swedish South Polar Expedition (1901–1903), it was described by Dusén in 1908 as having 87 leaf taxa. Forty-seven angiosperm taxa were described and/or illustrated. Many species are based on single specimens, and the flora has not been re-examined in its entirety since it was first described. This study is the first reassessment of the flora updating the original research using current methodologies, and permitting evaluation of the flora in the context of modern ideas on plant evolution and palaeogeography. This paper continues the revision of the material first studied by Dusén; a previous paper described the ferns and gymnosperms; here we describe the angiosperms. The revision is based on the original collections held at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, together with the first major new collections held at the British Antarctic Survey. Among the taxa recognized by Dusén, we recognize only three entire-margined and 11 tooth-margined angiosperms. This revision to 14 species notably lacks the two tropical elements originally described from the flora, Mollinedia seymourensis and Miconiiphyllum austral. Hence, its status as a 'Mixed Flora' comes into question and influences climatic interpretations based on Gondwanan floras.

ISSN 0311–5518.The humerus of the Carboniferous stem tetrapod Ossinodus pueri is described on the basis of a recently discovered specimen. Its exceptional preservation records abundant, direct evidence of muscle attachment in remarkable detail. The surface of the bone is covered with hundreds of fine, elongate, asymmetrical pits, which are interpreted as the attachment scars of individual muscle fascicles. Re-examination and further preparation of other, previously described pectoral appendicular elements of Ossinodus reveals that they too record direct evidence of muscle attachment. The patterns of scarring and inferred muscle attachment on the humerus and other bones are described and discussed. In turn, the pectoral musculoskeletal system of this animal is able to be reconstructed in detail, based on comparison to extant primitive tetrapods. In addition to providing an anatomical basis for biomechanical analysis of the locomotor capabilities of early tetrapods, this sheds much new light on the early evolution of the tetrapod forelimb. Importantly, most of the pectoral musculature of extant tetrapods appeared prior to the origin of the crown group, and much of this was present in primitive stem tetrapods such as Ossinodus.Peter J.

The conodont fauna indicates that the Xiala Formation previously assigned to the Guadalupian actually ranges from late Kungurian to late Wuchiapingian. The existence of the late Wuchiapingian conodont species Clarkina orientalis and C. liangshanensis in the Lhasa Block provides additional data to support the viewpoint that this block probably had been in a warm-water regime during the Wuchiapingian (Lopingian).Dong-Xun Yuan [yuanzi55@163.com], School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, 210093, PR China and State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing, 210008, PR China; Yi-Chun Zhang [yczhang@nigpas.ac.cn] and Shu-Zhong Shen [szshen@nigpas.ac.cn] (corresponding author), State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing, 210008, PR China; Yu-Jie Zhang [zebiac@163.com] and Tong-Xing Zhu [ztongxing88@yahoo.com.cn], Chengdu Center, China Geological Survey, 2 Renming Road North, Chengdu, 610081, PR China.

ISSN 0311-5518Fossils of the Ediacara biota record the earliest evidence of animal communities and, as such, provide an invaluable glimpse into the abiotic and biotic processes that helped shape the evolution of complex life on Earth. A diverse community of Ediacaran macro-organisms is preserved with high resolution in a fossil bed recently excavated from north Ediacara Conservation Park (NECP) in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Many of the commonly described Ediacaran taxa from the Flinders Ranges are represented on the bed surface and include: Parvancorina, Rugoconites, Spriggina, Dickinsonia, Tribrachidium, Kimberella, Charniodiscus and Yorgia, including two new taxa. Numerous additional fossil-bed fragments from the same locality were analysed that preserve a similar suite of taxa and shared sedimentology. On all surfaces, preserved microbial mat appeared complex, both in topography and in texture, and the unique combination of fine grainsize, high diversity and trace fossils provide insights into the palaeoecology of the ancient organisms that lived during the Ediacaran Period some 550 Ma. Several trace fossils are overlapped by body fossils, indicative of successive events, and complex organismal behaviour. The complexity of this fossil surface suggests that the primordial community was relatively mature and possibly at late-stage succession.Felicity J Coutts [felicity.coutts@adelaide.edu.au], School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide 5000, South Australia, Australia.

New analysis supports a sister group relationship between Dianolepis and the Bothriolepididae.

ISSN 0311-5518.Lower Devonian (Pragian and Emsian) conodonts are described from the Liujing section in Guangxi, South China, highlighting the phylogeny of early polygnathids and establishing the basis for faunal correlations with deposits throughout the world. Records of Eognathodus kuangi sp. nov. and E. nagaolingensis Xiong increase the biodiversity of the Pragian eognathodids in South China and represent intermediate stages and probably the latest eognathodids in the evolutionary succession from Eognathodus to Polygnathus. During this evolutionary succession, the degeneration of the sulcus (or the flattening of the upper platform surface) is the most important morphological change, especially in the eognathodid lineage. Polygnathus trilinearis, P. pireneae and P. sokolovi are recognized together for the first time in South China. The contemporaneous occurrences of the kitabiformis and sokoloviformis morphs of P. pireneae with P. sokolovi and their respective similarities to P. kitabicus and P. sokolovi suggest that the latter two species are phylogenetically linked with P. pireneae.

    "abstract": "The holotype (KUVP 1301) of Styxosaurus snowii—one of the earliest described elasmosaurid plesiosaurians—consists of a well-preserved cranium, mandible and articulated sequence of anterior–mid-series cervical vertebrae found in the lowermost Campanian strata of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member in the Niobrara Formation of Kansas, USA. This particular specimen has proven important for recent phylogenies of Elasmosauridae, and is integral to resulting definitions of the subfamily-level clade, Styxosaurinae. Despite this, KUVP 1301 has not been redescribed or figured in detail since its original taxonomic establishment. We, therefore, re-evaluated KUVP 1301 and assessed its phylogenetic implications. Several notable character states are pertinent for diagnosing S. snowii at genus and species level: (1) an anisodont functional dentition comprising enlarged premaxillary and dentary teeth with a pair of maxillary 'fangs', and elongate posterior-most dentary teeth that overlap the upper tooth row; (2) a prominent dorsomedian crest extending from the tip of the premaxillary rostrum, and expanding into a low 'mound-like' boss between the external bony nasal openings and orbits; (3) a pronounced convex projection on the posterolateral edge of the squamosals; and (4) platycoelous post-axial cervical vertebral centra that are substantially longer than high, and bear both lateral longitudinal ridges and ventral notches. Character state comparisons with the congeneric subfamily specifier Styxosaurus browni suggest that taxonomic distinction is possible, but equivocal. We, therefore, restrict our definition of Styxosaurus to morphologies observable in KUVP 1301. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of our first-hand data returns inconsistent elasmosaurid intra-clade relationships, especially with regard to Styxosaurinae. Consequently, we posit that a more targeted reassessment of Elasmosauridae is necessary to resolve both species-level topologies and higher taxonomy within the group.Sven Sachs* [sachs.pal@gmail.com] Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld, Abteilung Geowissenschaften, Adenauerplatz 2, 33602 Bielefeld, Germany; Johan Lindgren [johan.lindgren@geol.lu.se], Department of Geology, Lund University, Sölvegatan 12, SE-223 62 Lund, Sweden; Benjamin P.

Alcheringa 43, 335–350. ISSN 0311-5518The problematic late Ediacaran tubular fossil Corumbella werneri is revised based on two-dimensional compressions, and new three-dimensionally preserved specimens from the Tamengo Formation of the Corumbá Region in Mato Grosso do Sul, west-central Brazil. These fossils represent some of the oldest skeletonized metazoans and were originally described from diagenetically compacted tubes that prompted conflicting interpretations as either Ediacaran coronate scyphozoan exoskeletons, or conulariid tests. Our new material from Corumbá permits a morphological and taphonomic revision of C. werneri, which we suggest was probably a calcareous sinotubulitid. Corumbella werneri closely resembles the late Ediacaran Sinotubulites from South China, as well as the Silurian worm tube Eoalvinellodes, which has similar exterior ornamentation. Ultrastructurally, the tubes of C. werneri exhibit a coarse sparitic microtexture, which we attribute to diagenetic alteration. Partial flexibility also supports interpretation as an originally weakly calcified, or entirely organic exoskeleton. We therefore reject placement of C. werneri as a conulariid scyphozoan, and instead, advocate possible relationships with marine annelids.Detlef Hans-Gert Walde [walde.detlef@gmail.com], University of Brasília, Institute of Geosciences, Brasília-DF, Brazil; Bernd Weber [bweber@zedat.fu-berlin.de], Freie Universität Berlin, Institut für Geologische Wissenschaften, Malteserstr. 74–100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany; Bernd-D.

ISSN 0311-5518.The genus Umkomasia, a megasporophyll, belonging to the pteridosperms (seed ferns) in the family Umkomasiaceae (Corystospermaceae), is reassessed comprehensively worldwide. All previous records are analysed. Certain fertile structures previously attributed are reclassified. Umkomasia is shown to be restricted to the Triassic of Gondwana where it is associated with the genus Pteruchus, a microsporophyll, and the genus Dicroidium, a vegetative leaf. It is well represented from Argentina, Australia and southern Africa where the Molteno Formation is by far the most comprehensively sampled with eight species described. Two specimens from the upper Permian of India attributed to Umkomasia are reclassified as cf. Arberiopsis sp. A whorled fertile structure from Antarctica, previously assigned to Umkomasia, is reclassified in a new genus as Axsmithia uniramia. Another compression fossil and the permineralized Umkomasia resinosa remain as valid records from Antarctica. The material described as Umkomasia from the Triassic of China is reclassified as Stenorachis asiatica. The Lower Jurassic record from Germany is placed in a new genus as Kirchmuellia franconica. The records of Umkomasia sp. from the Rhaetic of Germany are reclassified as cf. Kirchmuellia sp. and the single specimen from the Jurassic of Libya as genus et sp. indet.

    "abstract": "Australia and New Guinea have experienced episodic connection and separation by high sea levels since the early Miocene. This has markedly influenced biotic patterns, although exactly how remains puzzling in some instances. One example concerns the palaeozoogeography of forest wallabies (Dorcopsini), all six living species of which are found only in New Guinea, even though most dorcopsin fossils recognized are from Australia. Here we review the taxonomic identity of ‘Silvaroo’ buloloensis from the late Pliocene Otibanda Formation of eastern Papua New Guinea, and show that, according to dental evidence, it is a dorcopsin along with its contemporary, Watutia novaeguineae. Phylogenetic analysis reconstructs ‘S.’ buloloensis as sister to Dorcopsoides fossilis from the late Miocene of central Australia. The degree of dental similarity between them leads us to include it in the same genus. These findings build upon other recent research on extinct New Guinea macropodines, revealing that both forest wallabies and tree-kangaroos are better represented in the fossil record than previously believed, although intriguingly none are ascribable to modern genera.",

    "abstract": "The chronostratigraphical scale is a hierarchical scheme that is subdivided into increasingly smaller units, from eonothem down to the level of the substage and beyond. Boundaries of chronostratigraphic intervals typically coincide with individual bioevents. As these intervals become smaller, their geographic utility tends to shrink. Typically, where the original interval is inapplicable, the next highest interval in the scale is used for communication. Where appropriate intervals are unavailable, confusion reigns. A stadial subdivision of the Australian mid–late Cambrian (equivalent to the international Miaolingian and Furongian series) was completed in 1993 with the definition of the Furongian Iverian Stage. One stage, the Ordian, was initially suggested as the lowest stage for what is now the Miaolingian, but should be considered to belong to upper Series 2 of the Cambrian. No older Cambrian stages have been proposed in Australia. Indeed, the base of the Ordian has not been defined, due in part to the incompleteness of Series 2 successions in central and northern Australia. A longstanding impediment to the establishment of lower Cambrian stages in Australia arises from the fact that the entire Australian stadial scheme for the Miaolingian and Furongian series was established in the cratonic basins of central-northern Australia, whereas the lower Cambrian is best developed in separate South Australian basins. With the rapid increase in knowledge of the biostratigraphic successions in the South Australian lower Cambrian (Terreneuvian and Series 2) over the last three decades, the time seems ripe for the establishment of such a stadial subdivision. This will require careful correlation between the mostly Terreneuvian and Series 2 succession in South Australia and the mostly Miaolingian–Furongian succession in central and northern Australia. Taxa that can be used for such a stadial subdivision include trilobites, organophosphatic brachiopods, archaeocyaths, small shelly fossils, molluscs and acritarchs, as each has provided the basis of zonations in the South Australian successions.",

The basis (formerly identified as the coxa) is preserved in one appendage. An allegedly long proximal podomere in the endopod is actually subdivided into two and, at least in posterior appendages, each of these podomeres bears a strong, angular endite. The large, subquadrate basis, angular endite on the first podomere of the endopod, and attachment of the exopod along the whole length of the basis are features shared with naraoiids, for which Naraoia longicaudata Zhang & Hou is exemplar. The long line of attachment of the exopod to the basis works as a hinge joint in E. intermedia and is a feature shared by Olenoides serratus. This joint allows rotation of the basis and endopod around the hinge line, permitting extensive leg movement without forcing the large exopod fan out of position. The shape of the basis in O. serratus is reinterpreted here, and a new reconstruction of the exopod shows detailed similarity to E. intermedia. The limbs of Eoredlichia show that appendage structure in primitive trilobites is little altered from shared ancestry with naraoiids. Keywords: limb structuretrilobitesnaraoiidsChengjiang fauna",

The sections include the stratotypes and reference sections for the New Zealand Duntroonian and Waitakian Stages (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene). Three key evolutionary events provide the main basis for correlation of the sections, and allow recognition of four zones. These events are, from oldest to youngest: the first appearance of Cytheralison amiesi, at about the Whaingaroan/Duntroonian Stage boundary; the last appearance of Agrenocythere? semivera, together with a major faunal replacement, in the lower Duntroonian; and the first appearance of Trachyleberis jilletti sp. nov. at the Duntroonian/Waitakian Stage boundary. The lower boundary of the lowermost zone and upper boundary of the uppermost zone are not defined since they occur beyond the limits of the sequence. This correlation is consistent with that provided by foraminifera and enhances stratigraphical resolution particularly through the Duntroonian Stage. Changes in relative abundance and species composition throughout the sequence are similar in the sections studied and are considered to be controlled by facies and water depth. An outer shelf fauna in the lower part of the Kokoamu Greensand is replaced in the upper Kokoamu Greensand by a relatively shallow mid shelf fauna which persists into the Otekaike Limestone. In the upper Waitakian part of the Otekaike Limestone an inner shelf environment is indicated. Five new species are proposed: Cytheralison spinosa sp. nov., Cytheralison parafava sp. nov., Rugocythereis reticulata sp. nov., Trachyleberis jilletti sp. nov. and Vitjasiella dulplicispina sp. nov.

Limulus and many malacostracans apparently have a signature ecdysial style; conversely, a range of moult configurations characterized trilobite ecdysis, and this variation is evident even within individual species. A canalised ecdysial habit may be safer or metabolically more efficient and therefore, summed over the history of the class, evolutionarily advantageous. Some trilobite clades show evolutionary trends toward morphologies that would have facilitated ecdysis (e.g. reduction in the number of thoracic segments, reduction in the number and prominence of spines), but co-adaptation or multiple-use effects complicate the evolutionary signal of ecdysial selection. Survivorship analysis supports a possible link between ecdysial habit and evolutionary success: genera with fewer thoracic segments (= easier ecydsis) are longer-lived. The increased predation pressure on trilobites through the Palaeozoic would have amplified the evolutionary impact of an inefficient moult habit. The cumulative effects of a less-than-optimal ecdysial habit, and a physiology that apparently required reconstituting a calcitic exoskeleton de novo with each moult, are compelling biotic factors to consider in examining functional interpretations, life histories, evolutionary trends, and ultimate disposition of the Trilobita.",

    "abstract": "The Billabong Creek Formation and overlying Gunningbland Formation within the Northparkes Group in the Gunningbland area, 28 km west of Parkes, range in age from late Darriwilian (late Middle Ordovician) to late Eastonian (middle Late Ordovician). These strata provide the most complete sequence through this interval in the central Lachlan Orogen in New South Wales. A biostratigraphic zonation spanning the Darriwilian to Gisbornian is proposed, employing conodonts and corals. This supplements the existing coral/stromatoporoid, brachiopod and trilobite faunal assemblages defining Eastonian and Bolindian shelly fossil zones. The Pygodus anserinus Zone (late Darriwilian) in the basal Billabong Creek Formation is succeeded by the Foerstephyllum-Billingsaria-Stratodictyon Assemblage-Zone (of Gisbornian age) in the middle Billabong Creek Formation. A further five Assemblage-Zones extending through the Eastonian succession are formally defined to replace the existing shelly fossil 'faunas'. New coral species described are Billingsaria domica, Eofletcheria subcerioidea, Foerstephyllum nelungaloo, and ?Paleoalveolites explanatus; a possible new species of the conodont Eoplacognathus is described, but not formally named.",

The taphonomy suggests that the deposit was accumulated by a predator. Site characteristics, prey size and bone damage patterns (greenstick fractures and evidence of digestion) suggest the predator was the extinct or near-extinct Laughing Owl Sceloglaux albifacies. The species assemblage represented by the fossils show that Sceloglaux was an opportunistic predator whose diet included birds, bats, frogs, skinks, geckos, and fish. The dominant prey were nocturnal ground-frequenting birds, particularly shearwaters and prions. The preferred habitats of the prey species and the deposit's age suggest that the river valley near the fossil site was forested, with areas of shrubland and grassland, during the coldest part of the Otiran Glaciation.",

Pseudonotictis pusillus is the smallest of the Santacrucian borhyaenoids and is known from fragmentary remains; from its small size, dental specializations and elbow anatomy, this species was certainly not far ecologically from an extant weasel. The postcranium of Sipalocyon gracilis, although poorly known, suggests climbing capabilities, and the pseudo-opposable pollex indicates skilful manipulative behaviour. Cladosictis patagonica was an active predatory form, short-legged and able to climb, although it was a less specialized arboreal form than the contemporaneous Prothylacinus patagonicus; the proportions of its limbs recall that of a living South American marten, the tayra.

The morphogenesis of this and the earliest meraspid growth stage are described, and their development compared to that of an associated agnostoid referred to Peronopsis. The differences between eodiscoid and agnostoid trilobites are reviewed in the light of much recently published information. A taxonomic separation of at least ordinal magnitude is advocated. If miomeran arthropods are related to polymeroid trilobites, then the eodiscoids are the closer of the two groups.",

The stratigraphical section of the Tupe Formation at La Herradura Creek is the stratotype of the Tivertonia jachalensis-Streptorhynchus inaequiornatus biozone, was previously regarded as being of Late Carboniferous age but here is assigned to the earliest Permian (Asselian). We describe and review the biozone assemblage, which consists of Streptorhynchus inaequiornatus, Tivertonia jachalensis, Kochiproductus sp., Costatumulus sp., Coronalosia argentinensis, Tupelosia paganzoensis, Trigonotreta pericoensis, Septosyringothyris sp. aff.

This brachiopod assemblage is related to Indian and Australian Early Permian faunas and its presence in the La Herradura Creek section provides new evidence in support of an Asselian (Early Permian) age for the Tivertonia jachalensis-Streptorhynchus inaequiornatus biozone. This assemblage is also important for intra- and inter-basinal correlation because several of its characteristic species have been identified from other sections of the Paganzo basin and the Río Blanco basin. The proposed age for this biozone is consistent with the age of palynological data from slightly above the marine faunas from the stratotype locality.",

P. morwellensis, the only macrofossil species previously known with organic preservation, is closest to the extant P. hypophyllus, which occurs from New Guinea to Borneo. P. lobatus is particularly distinct, and may represent a species with primitive photosynthetic organs in which webbing of the planated branch system is not complete, or it may be an advanced state, in which photosynthetic area has been reduced in response to the changing Tertiary climate.",

Thus a previous interpretation of extensive grasslands during the middle Tertiary is unlikely. The algal content is significant, indicating a swamp environment. Swamp species of grasses may form a significant component of modern swamp vegetation. The family Restionaceae contains many swamp species. Other likely swamp taxa in this assemblage include Cyperaceae, Sparganiaceae and Gleichenia. Pollen of the land vegetation at the base of the Namba Formation is dominated by gymnosperms, Casuarinaceae and a little Nothofagus, thus rainforest was present. The sample near the top of the formation contains pollen of Casuarinaceae, eucalypts, Acacia, Dodonaea and Hakea/Grevillea and the vegetation was probably dry sclerophyll forest. The assemblages reported here indicate a Late Oligocene — Early Miocene age for the base of the Namba Formation (a little older than the original dating of Early — Mid Miocene) but the top is younger, most likely Late Miocene-Pliocene.",

Two major types are recognised: the artus type (= dichograptid type of Bulman) in which th 11 is dicalycal, and the isograptid type (= isograptid + leptograptid types of Bulman) in which theca 12 is dicalycal. In branching dichograptids, distal stipe division takes place by replication of the thecal budding sequence employed in the initial dichotomy of the rhabdosome and is always of isograptid type. Dichotomies beyond the first are unknown in species with initial development of other than isograptid type. The thecal budding pattern and stipe composition of dendroids can be interpreted in terms of the structure of, and thecal notation used for, graptoloids and it is thus possible to compare directly the mode of stipe division in the two groups. It is found that both distal and proximal dichotomy in dendroids are achieved by a pattern of thecal budding closely comparable with that of the isograptid type of division in graptoloids. The isograptid development type is therefore thought to have been directly derived from dendroids, and is the primitive type for Graptoloidea. The artus type was derived via three or more independent lineages, at least one of which (that leading to the artus group of pendent didymograptids) involved an ancestor with isograptid development. Proximal end characters of Phyllograptus suggest that this genus and biserial graptolites of the family Diplograptidae shared a common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "The last 10 × 106 years, called here the ‘Ultimogene’, approximately the last half of the Neogene, is palynologically significant, because a level of near 100 per cent of extant genera pertains. This means that the methods of Flandrian (‘post-glacial’) pollen-analysis can be applied. This time-segment also makes sense palaeoclimatologically and palaeogeographically. Within the ‘Ultimogene’, repeated sudden changes in climate, as well as a general slide toward colder temperatures, cause corresponding changes in vegetation and palynofloras. Orogeny is responsible for some of the changes, for example in the Andes. Continental drift is a relatively minor factor, but has considerably affected plant distribution in India and Australia. ‘Ultimogene’ modernization of floras in response to all factors permits practical stratigraphy based on spores/pollen in western Eurasia, but this is difficult in North America because of plant migration pathways. Though there are exceptions, for the most part colder means drier in the ‘Ultimogene’. Palynologically-based investigations of warm-wet vs. cold-dry ‘cycles’ in Black Sea DSDP ‘Ultimogene’ cores, using the Steppe-Forest Index (SFI) and other measures, seem to indicate many very rapid, short-term cyclical swings in climate, such as those already known from pollen analysis in the latest Neogene.",

Associated fish remains indicate a Late Silurian or earliest Devonian age for the Grampians occurrence, and a Late Devonian (probably Frasnian) age for the Jemalong and Genoa River occurrences, although a Famennian age cannot be entirely excluded. The very sparse fossil record of Devonian tetrapods from the largest landmass of the time (Gondwana) is noted, as is the possibly earlier (?Frasnian) age for a tetrapod jaw recently reported from China. Consideration of new discoveries of sarcopterygian (lobefinned) fishes in Australia-Antarctica (East Gondwana), and the time-space distribution of some Devonian fishes, in particular phyllolepid and other placoderms associated with tetrapods in both Southern and Northern Hemispheres, but with a different age range, provide grounds for suggesting an alternative to the hypothesis that tetrapods evolved during a narrow time interval (Middle-Late Devonian) in the northern continent of Laurussia. The evidence for Frasnian-Famennian faunal interchange between Gondwana and Laurussia involving various Devonian vertebrate groups is summarised, and the possible utility of some placoderm fish groups as indicator species for tetrapod origins is discussed.",

Palynomorph assemblages recovered from the Tupe Formation at La Herradura Creek, San Juan province, Argentina, are analysed. The middle section of the sequence includes a marine fossiliferous interval belonging to the Tivertonia jachalensis–Streptorhynchus inaequiornatus (T–S) Faunal Biozone, recently ascribed an Early Permian age. The section below the marine fossiliferous unit yielded palynofloras typical of previously described ‘Tupense’ assemblages. The palynoflora recovered from beds above the marine horizon is diverse, relatively well preserved and includes species never recorded from the Tupe Formation. This latter palynoassemblage includes species diagnostic of Early Permian palynofloras such as Converrucosisporites confluens (Archangelsky & Gamerro) Playford & Dino, Pseudoreticulatispora pseudoreticulata (Balme & Hennelly) Bharadwaj & Srivastava, Horriditriletes ramosus (Balme & Hennelly) Bharadwaj & Salujha, Anapiculatisporites tereteangulatus (Balme & Hennelly) Playford & Dino, Laevigatosporites colliensis (Balme & Hennelly) Venkatachala & Kar, Marsupipollenites triradiatus Balme & Hennelly, Protohaploxypinus sewardii (Virkki) Hart and Pakhapites fusus (Bose & Kar) Menéndez.

Remains of stereospondyl amphibians from the Triassic – Jurassic boundary of the Algarve, southern Portugal, are described for the first time. They consist of several intercentra of different sizes, ribs and fragments of the scapular girdle and the skull. The opisthocoelous morphology of some of the disc-like intercentra and the presence of a lateral flange on the clavicle indicate that parts of the material can be referred unambiguously to metoposaurid stereospondyls, representing the first evidence of this group from the Iberian Peninsula. Several other disc-like intercentra that are amphicoelous and thinner than those of the metoposaurids can be referred to mastodonsaurid stereospondyls (either Mastodonsaurus or Cyclotosaurus). The fossil locality is situated in a palaeorift system that linked the known metoposaurid localities in eastern North America, Morocco, and Central Europe.",

The specimens represent three individuals referable to the Ensenadan (early to middle Pleistocene) species Arctotherium angustidens (Ursidae, Tremarctinae), the giant South American short-faced bear. Although the fossil record of short-faced bears in South America is very rich, they have not previously been recorded in association. These three individuals were found in a cave during quarry exploitation. We suggest that these bears represent the first record of a family group and open the discussion about cave utilization and hibernation or torpor by South American short-faced bears.

Large trilete megaspores similar to the dispersed megaspore genus Horstisporites Potonié are present in the megasporangia of the cone and the microsporangia contain small monolete spores similar to the dispersed microspore genus Aratrisporites Leschik. Skilliostrobus is placed in the family Lepidodendraceae in the order Lepidodendrales. The size of the cone suggests that the parent plant was comparable in size with small arborescent Palaeozoic lycopsids and with some species of Pleuromeia.

Alcheringa 33, 1–21. ISSN 0311-5518. The subarctometatarsus is a plesiomorphic form of arctometatarsus. Five individual subarctometatarsalian specimens are examined in this study including Microraptor gui, Sinornithosaurus millenii, Sinovenator changii, Sinovenator sp. and Sinornithoides youngi. Bivariate analysis illustrates a closer relationship between subarctometatarsalians and small theropods possessing the plesiomorphic theropod metatarsus (e.g. Compsognathidae and Archaeopteryx). Reduced major axis (RMA) analysis supported this conclusion but also indicates a distinct statistical difference between the three categories of theropod metatarsus. Additionally, development of the subarctometatarsus is inferred to have been linked to advanced cursoriality as implicated for the arctometatarsus. Structural similarity between the subarctometatarsus and the arctometatarsus portrays a common mechanical function of being able to withstand the forces of high impact with the substrate. Phylogenetic analysis reveals five independent origins of the arctometatarsus.",

Cranial and dental studies of Glossotherium robustum (Owen, 1842) (Xenarthra: Pilosa: Mylodontidae) from the Pleistocene of southern Brazil. Alcheringa, 1–16. ISSN 0311-5518. Mylodontine ground sloths were studied from several Pleistocene localities of Rio Grande do Sul State: São Gabriel (central region), Quaraí, Uruguaiana and Alegrete (western region) and Santa Vitória do Palmar (coastal region) municipalities. The cranial and mandibular material is assigned to Glossotherium robustum based on the enlargement of the anterior portion of the maxilla, a rounded and ventrolaterally arched fossa for the estylohyal, an elliptical occipital condyle, a spatulate symphyseal region of the mandible, together with the size and degree of lobulation of the teeth. Comparison with specimens from the Pampean region of Argentina, western Uruguay and northeastern Brazil revealed that the Rio Grande do Sul material is most similar morphologically to that of the Pampean region of Argentina and Uruguay. These southern specimens are morphologically distinct from Pleistocene material from tropical Brazil assigned to Glossotherium sp. The Pleistocene records of G. robustum indicate that this taxon was widely distributed between 20°S and 40°S spanning Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay, whereas Glossotherium sp. was restricted to latitudes <30°S. 在Rio Grande do Sul 的若干更新世地点如: Sa ͂o Gabriel (中区), Quarai ′, Uruguaiana及Alegrete(西区), 以及Santa Vito′ do Palmar(沿海区), 我们研究了Mylodontine地懒。根据颚骨前部分变大, 圆形腹侧向上弓的窝, 椭圆的枕髁, 下颚的匙形沿耻骨联合区, 以及牙齿分叶的范围和程度, 这些颅骨和下颚骨被归为Glossotherium robustum。与采自阿根廷Pampean地区、乌拉圭西部和巴西东北部的标本进行比较, 我们发现Rio Grande do Sul 标本在形态上与阿根廷和乌拉圭的最相似。这些南部标本在形态上与热带巴西的更新世Glossotherium sp.标本有很大差异。G. robustum的更新世记录表示, 这个分类群广泛分布于208S和408S之间, 包括阿根廷、巴西、玻利维亚、智利、乌拉圭和巴拉圭, 而Glossothrium sp. 只局限于纬度5308S。 Key words: Glossotherium robustum PleistoceneRio Grande do Sul StateBrazil Acknowledgements We thank Marcelo Reguero (Museo de La Plata), Deise R.

Revised stratigraphy of the Xiazhen Formation (Upper Ordovician) at Zhuzhai, South China, based on palaeontological and lithological data. Alcheringa 36, 393–412. ISSN 0311-5518. Three exposures of the Upper Ordovician Xiazhen Formation at Zhuzhai, Yushan, Jiangxi Province, China are re-measured and described in detail. Comparison of palaeontological and lithological data from the exposures (designated sub-sections ZU1, ZU2 and ZU3) reveals that the sub-sections overlap stratigraphically. Nearly identical assemblages of trilobites and brachiopods occur in mudstones of ZU1 and ZU3, whereas a different assemblage occurs in those of ZU2. Identical coral species occur in the overlapped intervals of ZU1 and ZU2, and ZU1 and ZU3, respectively. In addition, a distinctive identical lithological succession consisting of brachiopod-bearing nodular limestone at the base to coral floatstone at the top is evident in the overlapped interval of ZU1 and ZU2; prism-cracked algal laminites are found in the same interval; and bioclastic limestone beds, which represent bioherms consisting mainly of corals and stromatoporoids, occur in both ZU1 and ZU3. A thrust fault system appears to be responsible for the repetition in the subsections, and the faulting was probably due to the major post-Ordovician structural movements exerted on the Zhe-Gan Platform of the Jiangnan Region of the South China Block.

A polar dinosaur-track assemblage from the Eumeralla Formation (Albian), Victoria, Australia. Alcheringa 36, 171–188. ISSN 0311-5518. The Eumeralla Formation (Aptian–Albian) of the Otway Group in Victoria, Australia, has yielded a significant amount of dinosaur skeletal material since the late 1970s, which, when combined with finds from the Wonthaggi Formation (Aptian) of the upper Strzelecki Group, constitute the best-documented polar-dinosaur assemblage in the Southern Hemisphere. In contrast, dinosaur tracks have barely augmented this body fossil record; up to now, only one ornithopod track had been documented in any detail from the Otway Group. In this study, we report a new find of at least 24 dinosaur tracks preserved on two ripple-bedded sandstone blocks of the Eumeralla Formation, discovered at Milanesia Beach, Victoria. This dinosaur-track assemblage is the best in terms of numbers and quality found thus far in formerly polar environments of the Southern Hemisphere. One block includes the first known dinosaur trackway from the Cretaceous of Victoria, consisting of three consecutive footprints made by a small theropod. The assemblage indicates three differently sized theropods, thus providing new insights on dinosaur diversity and activity not indicated previously by body fossils in the Eumeralla Formation. Tracks are preserved in fluvial floodplain deposits and were possibly imprinted on emergent floodplain surfaces following seasonal flooding during a polar summer. The abundant tracks at this site suggest more such finds are likely in floodplain deposits of the Otway Group, although behavioural and preservational conditions unique to polar environments may have limited their formation.

Similarly, Deb Moore provided helpful logistical and moral support for those of us who conducted fieldwork in the area during June 2010. Museum Victoria graciously provided partial travel funding for AJM, and a field vehicle (with fuel) for AJM and THR during their fieldwork in the area. The Emory University Faculty Travel Fund granted the remaining travel funding for AJM, for which he is extremely grateful. David Pickering (Museum Victoria) assisted two of us (THR and PVR) with follow-up fieldwork at the site and recovery of the blocks, which are now at Museum Victoria. Ruth Schowalter and Naomi Hall are much appreciated for their spousal support of AJM and MH, respectively. Ms Schowalter accompanied three of us (AJM, THR, MH) to the site and assisted in some rugged field reconnaissance of the probable stratigraphic source of the track-bearing blocks, all while her husband (AJM) remained safely sedentary studying the tracks. The manuscript was improved considerably through the detailed and helpful reviews of Anthony (Tony) Fiorillo (Museum of Nature & Science, Dallas), Martin Lockley (University of Colorado-Denver), and Steve McLouglin (editor of Alcheringa). The Victoria Park Service is thanked for providing PVR with a collecting permit (No. 10004616) for fossils found in the area. Peter Burns (National Parks, Apollo Bay) is especially appreciated for giving advice on responsible processes and procedures for our study, respecting this beautiful area of Australia.",

The material, which is based upon leaf impressions, records early sporophyte growth stages. The specimens occur at discrete levels in clay pits at Dinmore, and the different leaf stages present suggest that they represent colonies of young submerged plants, mats of floating leaves, or a mixed assemblage of both.

Phylogenetic analyses based on two previously published data sets combining data from the new fossils did not provide conclusive evidence concerning the affinities of songziids. Whereas one analysis supported rallid affinities, the other resulted in a clade including Songziidae, Messelornithidae, Rallidae and Heliornithidae. Apart from the proportionally much longer legs, the osteology of Songzia is, however, more similar to that of the contemporary Messelornithidae than to Rallidae.",

The new species is represented by mummified fossil leaves with well-preserved cuticle and associated clusters of achenes bearing persistent, long plumose styles. This basal angiosperm family is of significance because of its classic southern disjunctions and ecological importance in extant Gondwana-type rainforests, but has a very sparse fossil record. The present study describes one of very few convincing leaf fossils for Atherospermataceae and the only definitive fossil fruits. The presence of fossil Laurelia in Oligo–Miocene New Zealand combined with fossil leaf impressions from the late Eocene, Miocene dispersed cuticle and pollen from the Oligocene to Holocene shows that the family has had a long history in Cenozoic New Zealand.

ISSN 0311–5518.A fusuline fauna consisting of ten species in five genera from the Qudi Formation of the Jiaomuri and Gangtangcuo sections in the Rongma area, northern Tibet, is described. This fauna contains a few typical Peri-Gondwanan fusuline species such as Pseudofusulina pamirensis, Neodutkevitchia insignis and N. sp. cf. N. tumidiscula. The fauna is dated as Artinskian based on the presence of both genera Chalaroschwagerina and Praeskinnerella. The Peri-Gondwanan fusuline fauna in the Qiangtang Block is grouped palaeobiogeographically into the Southern Transitional Zone, which is located in the southern part of the Peri-Gondwanan blocks during the late Sakmarian and Artinskian. Moreover, the occurrence of the Peri-Gondwanan fusuline fauna, the lithological transition from glacimarine deposits to carbonates, and the Peri-Gondwanan fusulines’ apparent southeastward migration from the Kalmard Block of central Iran during the Artinskian, are interpreted here to be the result of global warming after the peak of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age.Yi-chun Zhang [geozyc@yahoo.com], School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Melbourne Burwood Campus, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Victoria 3125, Australia; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Yue Wang [yuewang@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Yu-jie Zhang [zebiac@163.com], Chengdu Center, China Geological Survey, 2 Renming Road North, Chengdu 610081, PR China; Dong-xun Yuan [yuanzi55@163.com], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing 210008, China; Department of Earth Sciences, Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing 210008, PR China.

From these faunas, eight successive conodont biozones of Tremadocian to middle Floian (Early Ordovician) age are recognized, including the Cordylodus lindstromi Biozone, Cordylodus angulatus Biozone, Chosonodina herfurthi Biozone, Paltodus deltifer Biozone, Paroistodus proteus Biozone, Triangulodus bifidus Biozone, Serratognathus diversus Biozone and Prioniodus elegans Biozone. Several zonal index species of the Baltoscandian succession—Paltodus deltifer, Paroistodus proteus and Prioniodus elegans—are described and illustrated in detail for the first time from South China. Co-occurrence of P. proteus and Serratognathus bilobatus in several samples below the appearance of P. elegans also confirms correlation of the S. diversus Biozone (basal Floian) with the upper P. proteus Zone of the Baltoscandian succession. These Zhejiang faunas are dominated by pandemic forms, and are similar to those of the Open-Sea Realm elsewhere, inhabiting deep, offshore environments.本文记录了采自中国东南部浙江省Liuxia组、Shijiatou组和景山组的四十二个牙形石种，古地理上这些组位于面向扬子地台的江南斜坡上。从这些动物群中识别出八个连续的牙形石生物带，年龄为从特马豆克阶至中弗洛阶（早奥陶世），包括Cordylodus lindstromi生物带、Cordylodus angulatus生物带、Chosonodina herfurthi生物带、Paltodus deltifer生物带、Paroistodus proteus生物带、Triangulodus bifidus 生物带、Serratognathus diversus生物带和Prioniodus elegans生物带。Baltoscandian 阶的若干生物带代表种Paltodus deltifer、Paroistodus proteus和Prioniodus elegans是首次在华南被描述和详细说明。Paroistodus proteus 与Serratognathus bilobatus 在若干样品中同时出现于 P. elegans的出现之下，证实了S. diversus 生物带（Floian阶底部）与Baltoscandian阶序列中的P. proteus 带上部的对比。这些浙江动物群以广布分子为主，类似于其它地区开放海中的分子，居住于深的近海环境。Key words: conodontsbiostratigraphyEarly OrdovicianZhejiangSouth China.

Based on a single ulna recovered from Early Cretaceous high-latitude deposits in southeastern Australia, the fossil was originally classified as a neoceratopsian, but subsequently reassigned to Genasauria indet. because of comparisons with atypical thyreophorans. However, a morphometric and structural re-examination of the holotype indicates that it is proportionally distinguishable among dinosaurians and, indeed, manifests decisive statistical compatibility with ceratopsians. Statistical assessment similarly yields a synapomorphy that places the taxon robustly within Ceratopsia. Most certainly, identification of a unique differential character state combination renders S. arthurcclarkei as valid. Its affinity with ceratopsians concurs with proliferating records of other Laurasian dinosaur lineages from the Southern Hemisphere, and may reflect ancient Pangaean dispersals into or out of Gondwana.Thomas H.

Terminal Cambrian and Early Ordovician (Tremadocian) conodonts from Eastern Alborz, north-central Iran. Alcheringa ##, ###-###. ISSN 0311-5518.Uppermost Cambrian (Furongian) and Lower Ordovician (Tremadocian) deposits of eastern Alborz in northern Iran contain several successive low- to moderate-diversity conodont associations including 13 genera and 19 species of euconodonts, paraconodonts and protoconodonts, which define six biozones: 1, the Proconodontus muelleri; 2, Eoconodontus notchpeakensis; 3, Cordylodus andresi; 4, Cordylodus proavus; 5, Paltodus deltifer; and 6, Paroistodus proteus zones. With the exception of Cordylodus andresi, which is otherwise known from Baltoscandia and from the Oaxaquia terrane (Mexico), all index-taxa are geographically widespread, allowing long-range correlation within the Cold Domain or the North Atlantic Province, and in particular with Baltica. Invasion of euconodonts in the Alborz region, defined by the first occurrence of Proconodontus muelleri, coincides closely with a steady rise in sea level and termination of carbonate sedimentation, whereas the transition from the Proconodontus muelleri to Eoconodontus notchpeakensis zones occurs during a highstand interval unlike in Laurentian sequences. The interval corresponding to the Cordylodus andresi and Cordylodus proavus zones, and the transition from the Paltodus deltifer to Paroistodus proteus zones coincided with unstable sea levels and the formation of shoal complexes. The lower boundary of the Floian Stage can be provisionally placed slightly below the first documented occurrence of Acodus sp. cf.

Palaeoecological insights into the Changhsingian–Induan (latest Permian–earliest Triassic) bivalve fauna at Dongpan, southern Guangxi, South China. Alcheringa 40, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518.The Talung Formation (latest Permian) and basal part of Luolou Formation (earliest Triassic) of the Dongpan section have yielded 30 bivalve species in 17 genera. Eight genera incorporating 11 species are systematically described herein, including three new species: Nuculopsis guangxiensis, Parallelodon changhsingensis and Palaeolima fangi. Two assemblages are recognized, i.e., the Hunanopecten exilis–Euchondria fusuiensis assemblage from the Talung Formation and the Claraia dieneri–Claraia griesbachi assemblage from the Luolou Formation. The former is characterized by abundant Euchondria fusuiensis, an endemic species, associated with other common genera, such as Hunanopecten, which make it unique from coeval assemblages of South China. A palaeoecological analysis indicates that the Changhsingian bivalve assemblage at Dongpan is diverse and represented by various life habits characteristic of a complex ecosystem. This also suggests that redox conditions were oxic to suboxic in deep marine environments of the southernmost Yangtze Basin during the late Changhsingian, although several episodes of anoxic perturbations and declines in palaeoproductivity saw deterioratation of local habitats and altered the taxonomic composition or population size of the bivalve fauna.Tinglu Yang [yang@geology.so], School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, 388 Lumo Road, Hongshan, Wuhan 430074, PR China; Weihong He* [whzhang@cug.edu.cn] and Kexin Zhang [kx_zhang@cug.edu.cn], State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, 388 Lumo Road, Hongshan, Wuhan 430074, PR China; Shunbao Wu [shbwu@cug.edu.cn], Yang Zhang [zhangy05@163.com], Mingliang Yue [812182779@qq.com], Huiting Wu [ht_wu415@163.com] and Yifan Xiao [shadowyi@sohu.com], School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, 388 Lumo Road, Hongshan, Wuhan 430074, PR China.",

However, the only known specimen has juvenile traits and is strongly similar to the australobatrachian Calyptocephalella. We re-examined the morphology of W. gerholdi and provide additional anatomical information and comparisons with juvenile individuals of Ceratophryidae and Calyptocephalella gayi, the only extant species of Calyptocephalella. We reject a close relationship between W. gerholdi and Ceratophryidae. Furthermore, the holotype is indistinguishable from juveniles of C. gayi and shares with all the species of this genus a character state combination that seems unique among anurans. Therefore, we consider Wawelia to be a junior synonym of Calyptocephalella. The problematic taxonomic status of numerous fossil species of Calyptocephalella, together with its untested monophyly, also prompts us to provisionally consider the extinct species as a species inquirenda included in this genus, pending a comprehensive revision of all available remains.Laura Nicoli [lnicoli@macn.gov.ar] and Julián Faivovich [julian@macn.gov.ar], División Herpetología, and Paula Muzzopappa [pmuzzopappa@macn.gov.ar], Sección Paleontología de Vertebrados, Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales 'Bernardino Rivadavia'-CONICET, Av.

    "abstract": "Abstract Natural casts of seven small footprints have been identified on a single weathered block derived from the Precipice Sandstone (Lower Jurassic) of the Carnarvon Gorge, southeastern Queensland. The footprints are attributed to ornithopod dinosaurs and are referred to the ichnogenus Anomoepus. They appear to be most similar to the ichnospecies Anomoepus gracillimus, originally defined on footprints from the Lower Jurassic of the northeastern United States. This identification is consistent with the presumed age of the Precipice Sandstone, since Anomoepus or closely related ichnotaxa are common in Lower Jurassic sediments of the United States, Europe and southern Africa but have never been identified with certainty in Triassic sediments. The tracks described here were made by at least four dinosaurs, all estimated to have been about 30 cm high at the hip and less than 1·3 m in total length. In their general appearance these animals probably resembled the small plant-eating dinosaur Fabrosaurus (Lesothosaurus), from the Lower Jurassic of southern Africa.

These fossils constrain hypotheses on the age and environment of formation of the seamounts and also give data on oceanographic conditions existing at the time of accumulation of the sediments. All sediments accumulated in normal marine salinities. Gascoyne Seamount sedimentation originated in tropical to subtropical water 15–20 m deep but age-diagnostic fossils have not been recovered. Taupo Seamount includes sediments with a Late Miocene foraminiferid fauna with abundant calcareous algae but lacking Lepidocyclina. Water temperature was tropical to subtropical. Derwent Hunter Seamount has a similar biota but includes Lepidocyclina. The age is earliest Middle Miocene. Stradbroke Seamount yielded Middle Miocene ooze but this probably represents part of its history significantly after the initial volcanic phase of its buildup. Britannia Seamount contains earliest Middle Miocene (N9) L. howchini, planktonic and encrusting foraminiferids and calcareous algae suggesting accumulation in shallow water. Conditions were tropical to subtropical. Moreton Seamount yielded a latest Miocene tropical ooze and Recorder Seamount produced no identifiable biota. The Lord Howe chain seamounts yield ages consistent with the hypothesis that they formed as the Indo-Australian plate moved north at a steady rate (6 cm/yr) over a stationary hotspot. Nova Bank samples are both latest Oligocene and earliest Miocene in age and accumulated in outer continental shelf depths. Argo Bank consists in part of lepidocyclinid limestone of Middle Miocene age. Gifford Guyot has calcarenite of latest Early Miocene age with volcanic debris suggesting that this is the age of part of the building phase of that seamount. Capel Bank samples yielded only Quaternary ooze. Several younger samples were recovered and these yield data on the interval after the initial phase of seamount formation. Many such data are from cavity and burrow infill in the primary (or oldest) sediment. Others are nonlithified ooze samples.",

They comprise four genera, including two new genera: Ovaluta gen. nov. is established for some species found in China which were previously described under the name of Aluta; Phaseolella gen. nov., with distinctive carapace features, should be referred to phosphatocopines. The five new species proposed are Monasterium bucerum, Houlongdongella xichuanensis, Ovaluta henanensis, Phaseolella dimorpha, and P. curvata. Abundant bradoriids, isolated by etching limestone with dilute acid, permitted detailed study of their ontogeny. The sexual dimorphism of Phaseolella dimorpha, which may be the earliest (Lower Cambrian) record so far known in Bradoriida, is demonstrated by the growth curve in a scatter diagram. Growth of this species is isometric in juvenile stages but anisometric in pre-adult-adult stages. Nevertheless, separate moult stages could not be distinguished during its ontogeny. In contrast, 9 moult stages can be recognized in Houlongdongella xichuanensis, at a growth rate of about 1.40, which suggests upon moulting an increase in volume of 2.74 times that of the previous instars. Clearly, some Cambrian bradoriids, at least, are closely related to ostracodes on such evidence. Although poorly known, the Cambrian bradoriid fauna of Xichuan seems most closely related to that of Queensland. Key words: Bradoriidagrowth instarsEarly CambrianChinaXichuannew taxataxonomy",

The co-occurrence of Paroistodus horridus, Histiodella kristinae and Appalachignathus delicalulus in the fauna suggests the limestone was originally deposited in late Darriwilian (most likely early-mid Da3) time, providing a maximum age constraint on its inclusion in the Oakdale Formation.

The specimen of Nothofagus (one of the transported specimens) constitutes the first identification of a macrofossil of this genus from this interval in southeastern mainland Australia, while its conjunction with the myrtaceous specimens (one probably in situ) may indicate vegetation zonation according to elevation, as proposed on pollen evidence from Kiandra.

Occasionally, a sudden and strong increase in productivity occurred which correlated to a rapid and well marked increase in the oxygen minimum zone. Physico-chemical factors, which developed following bacterial breakdown of organic matter that had accumulated on the bottom, are reflected in Bradleya shells by distinct signs of aggradation/degradation. A few allochthonous forms from the nearby continental shelf were transported downwards onto this part of the upper slope.

Fifteen ostracod species have been recovered from 179 samples: three are new, three are in open nomenclature and the others have living representatives. The ostracod data compared with pollen curves for both sites demonstrate, for most levels, a good correlation between the abundance of ostracods and that of Cyperaceae and Potamogeton-Triglochin pollen. This implies that ostracods can be successfully used as indicators of different water regimes for spring-fed swamps.

An opalized unionoid bivalve bearing potential vertebrate bite marks is described from Lower Cretaceous non-marine deposits of Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. Damage to the shell includes a series of regularly spaced indentations with associated depression fracturing and some surface crushing. These injuries are consistent with vertebrate feeding traces reported on other fossil molluscs (cephalopods) and suggest that a bivalve-eating predator might have been present in the Lightning Ridge palaeofauna. The size and spacing of the apparent tooth marks closely match the dental morphology of several sympatric vertebrate taxa: large osteichthyan or chondrichthyan fish, crocodiles, and pliosauroid plesiosaurs. The feasibility of these and other vertebrates as potential causes of the pathologies is discussed.

Alcheringa 33, 91–111. ISSN 0311-5518. The Upper Triassic Maleri Formation, represented by red clays and sandstones, has to date not produced any plant macrofossils or palynomorphs. Many spiral and non-spiral coprolites collected during this study from the Maleri Formation of the Pranhita-Godavari Valley were analysed for palynomorphs. Based on shape, nature of coiling and size, the Maleri coprolites are classified into seven groups. Of these, only Group-I, Type 5 (non-spiral) and amphipolar (spiral) types yielded diverse gymnospermous and pteridophytic spores, pollen, other plant debris and sparse fungal spores and algal remains. Occurrences of Antulsporites varigranulatus, Aratrisporites spp., Cadargasporites baculatus, Dubrajisporites isolatus, Enzonalasporites vigens, Foraminisporis coelatus, Grandispora spinosa, Kraeuselisporites saeptatus, Polycingulatisporites reduncus, Staurosaccites spp., Tethysispora unica and Tikisporites balmei confirm a Late Triassic age for the coprolite-bearing red clays. Records of Classopollis classoides and Callialasporites turbatus/dampieri in these assemblages more precisely suggest a Norian to Rhaetian age. The non-spiral coprolites were possibly produced by aquatic piscivorous animals whereas the spiral coprolites may have been produced by an as yet unidentified fish taxon. The coprolite-producing animals (spiral and non-spiral groups) possibly ingested gymnospermous and pteridophytic plant remains passively along with water or their herbivorous prey.

This suggested that the group may have originated in Laurussia, with advanced tristichopterids later reaching Gondwana (Middle–Late Devonian). Reconsideration of evidence from structure of the palate and scale morphology suggests an alternative phylogeny, with an endemic Gondwanan clade (subfamily Mandageriidae nov.) comprising at least three genera: Cabonnichthys and Mandageria from Canowindra, an undescribed tristichopterid from Eden, NSW, and possibly Notorhizodon from Antarctica. Distinctive isolated scales of 'mandageriid' type are illustrated from the Antarctic Aztec Siltstone assemblage and contrasted with typical tristichopterid scales, including new examples illustrated from the Givetian Bunga beds, NSW. Biogeographic implications include a possible Gondwanan origin for tristichopterids.",

A once more widespread distribution of its key plants in the context of a cooling and drying Neogene world suggests the current vegetation of New Caledonia is the result of contraction, or even a migration, from more southerly landmasses. Thus, New Zealand may have been a source of at least some of New Caledonia's plants.",

ISSN 0311-5518. Conodonts are documented from the basal Yenwashan Formation at the Huangnitang Section (the GSSP section for the base of the Darriwilian), exposed near Changshan County town in western Zhejiang. The fauna consisting of 14 species is dominated by Pygodus anserinus, Periodon aculeatus, Protopanderodus cooperi, Costiconus ethingtoni and Dapsilodus viruensis. Both P. anserinus and P. cooperi are revised as having a septimembrate apparatus. The Pa element of P. anserinus has a morphology that varies from the primitive form with node-like denticles of the fourth row only developed on the distal part of the platform, to the advanced form with a well-developed fourth row of denticles. Association of these two morphotypes of P. anserinus, and the absence of P. serra and P. xinjiangensis in the basal Yenwashan Formation, suggests correlation of this level with the upper part of the P. anserinus Biozone (earliest Late Ordovician). This age determination agrees with the FAD of Nemagraptus gracilis immediately below in black shales intercalated with thinly bedded limestones at the very top of the underlying Hulo Formation, and provides new data for correlation with the graptolite biozone.",

The Middle Ordovician successions in the Central Precordillera of Argentina are characterized by carbonate and fine mixed carbonate/siliciclastic deposits. Two middle Darriwilian sections spanning the Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus to Eoplacognathus suecicus Zones were sampled for conodonts, among which were found species of Histiodella. We revised the biostratigraphical distribution of these species in the Middle Ordovician of the Precordillera. This study confirms that the Darriwilian species of Histiodella present in the Argentine Precordillera have a similar distribution to those of equivalent age in Newfoundland, South China and the Baltic region. On the other hand, the overlap in the ranges of H. holodentata and H. kristinae seems to be restricted to a fairly short interval in the upper part of the E. pseudoplanus Zone. We also propose that the FAD of H. kristinae Stouge is accurately positioned in the upper part of the E. pseudoplanus Zone; thus this species should not be used to define the base of the E. suecicus Zone in the Ordovician biozonation of the Argentine Precordillera.

An additional basal sauropodomorph specimen from theUpperTriassic Caturrita Formation, southern Brazil, with comments on the biogeography of plateosaurids. Alcheringa, 1–10. ISSN0311-5518. We describe an additional saurischian specimen from the Caturrita Formation (Norian) of the Parana Basin, southern Brazil. This material was collected in the 1950s and remained unstudied due to its fragmentary condition. Detailed comparisons with other saurischians worldwide reveal that some characters of the ilium, including the low ventral projection of the medial wall of the acetabulum and its concave ventral margin, together with the short triangular shape of the pre-acetabular process and its mound-like dorsocaudal edge, resemble those of sauropodomorphs such as Plateosaurus and Riojasaurus. This set of traits suggests that MN 1326-V has affinities with basal Sauropodomorpha, probably closer to plateosaurians than to Saturnalia-like taxa. Previous records of this clade in the Caturrita Formation include Unaysaurus, which has been related to Plateosaurus within Plateosauridae. Alternative schemes suggest that plateosaurids include Plateosaurus plus the Argentinean 'prosauropods' Coloradisaurus and Riojasaurus. Both hypotheses raise biogeographic questions, as a close relationship between faunas from South America and Europe excluding Africa and North America is not supported by geological and biostratigraphical evidence. Additionally, the absence of plateosaurids in other continents suggests that the geographical distribution of thistaxon is inconsistent with the geological history of western Pangaea, and this demands further investigations of the phylogeny of sauropodomorphs or improved sampling.

Alcheringa 41, 433–463.Screen washing of the condensed phosporite-bearing sands at the top of the Albian succession at Annopol, Poland, produced 789 selachian teeth of which 264 are determinable to at least genus level. The sediment type and methods of processing prevented recovery of small-toothed taxa, resulting in an assemblage comprising 13, mostly large-toothed taxa. Lamniformes dominates with Dwardius sp. being, by far, the most common taxon. Observations on vertical distribution and preservation of the teeth (with focus on the adhered phosphatic matrix), coupled with biostratigraphic ranges of co-occurring ammonites, indicate that the majority of the shark material is attributable to the Mortoniceras rostratum or, more probably, M. perinflatum Zone (late late Albian; mid-'Vraconnian'). This is compatible with the composition of the shark assemblage, characterized by the co-occurrence of Paraisurus sp. aff. P. compressus, Cretoxyrhina vraconensis and Squalicorax teeth with strong serrations on the cutting edges. The tightly curved basal edge of the root in lateral teeth of C. vraconensis conforms to that of teeth from the Pawpaw Formation of Texas (M. rostratum Zone) and differs from the more divergent root lobes in younger specimens from the uppermost Albian and/or lowermost Cenomanian of Kolbay, Mangyshlak. Some specimens in the studied assemblage are probably older, within the range from the middle to earliest late late Albian. The strong numerical dominance of either Cretoxyrhina or Dwardius in late late Albian to early Cenomanian selachian faunas indicates competitive exclusion in these similar-sized, apex predatory sharks.Mikael Siversson* [mikael.siversson@museum.wa.gov.au], Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Western Australian Museum, 49 Kew Street, Welshpool, Western Australia 6106, Australia; Marcin Machalski [mach@twarda.pan.pl], Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, ul.

ISSN 0311-5518Rutgersella is a problematic fossil from the early Silurian (Llandovery) Shawangunk Formation of New Jersey, at first interpreted as a jellyfish comparable with Ediacaran fossils, such as Dickinsonia. Three proposed species of Rutgersella from the same locality are here regarded as growth or reproductive variants of a single species, R. truexi. Sedimentary structures, associated trace fossils and petrographic examination now show that they were sessile organisms of intertidal mudflats. These fossils have been dismissed as pyrite suns, but thin-sections show that they were weakly pyritized, organic structures, with a quilted hollow internal structure, similar to Seilacher's constructional and taxonomic concept of Vendobionta. As for Cambrian Swartpuntia, and Devonian Protonympha, Rutgersella may be a post-Ediacaran vendobiont. The biological affinities of Rutgersella are problematic, but are compared with coenocytic green algae, cellular slime moulds, puffball-like fungal fruiting bodies and foliose lichens.Gregory J.

The Permian lycophytes of the La Golondrina Formation (Santa Cruz province, Argentina) have remained unstudied for almost 50 years. This study reviews material described by Archangelsky in 1960 and increases the representation of specimens via new collections from the lower and middle members of the formation. The lycophytes, previously assigned to typical Laurasian genera, are re-analyzed and re-assigned to Gondwanan genera where appropiate. Two new lycophyte taxa, Bumbudendron patagonicum comb. nov. and Cyclodendron golondrinensis sp. nov. are proposed, and two specimens are retained under open nomenclature until better preserved material becomes available. Based on this study, the biostratigraphic range of Bumbudendron is extended to the Permian, whereas Cyclodendron remains a useful Permian stratigraphic index as previously suggested. Palaeoecological inferences derived from growth habit, floristic association and sedimentary facies indicate that these plants developed under micro- to meso-thermal, humid conditions.",

Four Ambocoeliidae brachiopod species including one new species (Crurithyris tazawai sp. nov., Crurithyris sp., Paracrurithyris pygmaea and Attenuatella mengi) are described from the Changhsingian (Late Permian) deep-water facies of South China. Analysis of the morphology, palaeoecology and palaeogeographical and temporal distributions of these species revealed that the presence of a delthyrium and/or the micro-ornaments among three of the four species (Crurithyris tazawai sp. nov., Paracrurithyris pygmaea and Attenuatella mengi) favoured an epifaunal (epiphytic) lifestyle. Morphological differences suggest that Paracrurithyris pygmaea may have been more effective metabolically in forming the shell compared with Attenuatella mengi and Crurithyris tazawai. The temporal and palaeogeographical distribution of Attenuatella suggests that A. mengi inhabited cool or cold deep waters. Both Crurithyris tazawai and Attenuatella mengi disappeared earlier in the stratigraphic record than Paracrurithyis pygmaea during the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. These differences in timing of extinction, morphology and palaeogeographical distributions suggest that oxygen deficiency and trophic resource limitation (a consequence of the changing composition of marine phytoplankton in the seas) may have contributed to the end-Permian mass extinction.",

ISSN 0311-5518A historical account of research on glossopterid ovuliferous reproductive structures reveals starkly contrasting interpretations of their architecture and homologies from the earliest investigations. The diversity of interpretations has led to the establishment of a multitude of genera for these fossil organs, many of the taxa being synonymous. We identify a need for taxonomic revision of these genera to clearly demarcate taxa before they can be used effectively as palaeobiogeographic or biostratigraphic indices. Our assessment of fructification features based on extensive studies of adpression and permineralized fossils reveals that many of the character states for glossopterids used in previous phylogenetic analyses are erroneous. We interpret glossopterid fertiligers to have been borne in loose strobili in which individual polysperms represent fertile cladodes of diverse morphologies subtended by a vegetative leaf or bract. Polysperms within the group are variously branched or condensed with ovule placement ranging from marginal to abaxial, in some cases occurring on recurved branchlets or in cupule-like structures. Glossopterid polysperms of all types are fringed by one or two ranks of wing-like structures that may represent the remnants of megasporophylls that were, ancestrally, developed on the fertile axillary shoot. Glossopterid fertiligers have similarities to the condensed bract/ovuliferous scale complexes of conifer cones, but comparisons with Mesozoic seed-ferns are hindered by insufficient data on the arrangement and homologies of the ovule-bearing organs of the latter group. Nevertheless, glossopterid polysperms differ from the ovuliferous organs of Mesozoic seed-ferns by longitudinal versus transverse folding, respectively.Stephen McLoughlin* [steve.mcloughlin@nrm.se], Department of Palaeobiology, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Box 50007, 104 05 Stockholm, Sweden; Rose Prevec [r.prevec@am.org.za], Department of Earth Sciences, Albany Museum, 40 Somerset Street, Makhanda, 6139, Eastern Cape, South Africa, and Department of Botany, Rhodes University, PO Box 94, Makhanda, 6140, Eastern Cape, South Africa.",

The squamates recovered from Cabeza Blanca include both lizards (an indeterminate Iguanidae and a probable Iguaninae) and snakes (Madtsoiidae). If these taxonomic assignments are correct, the presence of an Iguaninae at such a latitude is unexpected because these lizards are presently absent from Argentine territory.

    "abstract": "AbstractComputed tomography (CT) and traditional techniques were used to study the internal morphology of modern fruits of Pleiogynium timoriense (DC.) Leenh., and phosphatized and silicified fruits that were considered to belong to the genus. The results demonstrate that phosphatized fruits from the Oligocene–Miocene Dunsinane site at Riversleigh and silicified fruits from the Oligocene Glencoe Site, which are both in Queensland, are referable to Pleiogynium. The Riversleigh material (Pleiogynium wannanii Rozefelds, Dettmann & Clifford sp. nov.) is very similar to extant P. timoriense (DC.) Leenh. Both possess locules that, in the vertical axial plane, are asymmetrically reniform and enclosed by a two-layered endocarp, the inner layer woody and resistant to decay, the outer of fibres and parenchyma, surrounded by a mesocarp of fibres and sclereids and a parenchymatous exocarp. The outer mesocarp is sculpted by meridionally arranged, elongate depressions (germination apertures) situated at the dorsal surface of each locule; erosion of the mesocarp and outer endocarp provides passage for emergence of the embryo’s radicle on germination. The silicified material from Glencoe (P. parvum Rozefelds, Dettmann & Clifford sp. nov.) is smaller in all its parts and has locules that are ovate in the vertical axial plane. Discrete, cap-like, opercula are not evident in the fruit wall of the fossil and extant fruits studied. The presence of Pleiogynium, and associated taxa, indicates the existence of rainforest communities at Glencoe, and mixed open forest/rainforest at Riversleigh during Oligocene–Miocene times. The multilocular, fossil fruit described as Pleiogynium mitchellii Collinson, Manchester and Wilde from the Eocene deposits at Messel Quarry, Germany, is not considered to belong in the genus, as evidence of elongate depressions on the dorsal surface of the fruit stones has not been demonstrated conclusively, and its internal morphology/anatomy differs significantly from that of Pleiogynium.计算机断层扫描（CT）和传统技术被用来研究Pleiogynium timoriense（DC.）Leenh 的现生水果和磷化和硅化水果的内部形态，后者被认为属于该属。 结果表明，昆士兰州Riversleigh的渐新世 - 中新世Dunsinane化石点的磷化水果和昆士兰州的渐新世Glencoe化石点的硅化水果，都可认为是Pleiogynium。Riversleigh地区的化石材料（Pleiogynium wannanii Rozefelds，Dettmann＆Clifford sp. nov）与现生P. timoriense（DC.）Leenh很相似。两者都具有在垂直轴向平面呈 不对称肾形的子房室。子房室由双层型内果皮包裹，耐腐烂的木质内层和纤维质和实质的外层，并由纤维质和石细胞团的中果皮和薄壁外果皮所包围。中果皮外层刻有位于子房室背面的经向排列的长型凹陷（发芽孔）;中果皮和内果皮外层的侵蚀为种子发芽时胚胎的胚根出现提供了通道。Glencoe的硅化材料（P.parvum Rozefelds，Dettmann＆Clifford sp.nov）的所有部件都更小，并具有垂直轴向平面呈卵形的子房室。离散的帽状鳃盖在化石和现生水果的水果壁上都不明显。 Pleiogynium及其相关类群的存在表明Glencoe地区渐新世 - 中新世时期热带雨林群落的存在，也表明Riversleigh地区同时的混合疏林/雨林的存在。我们认为，德国Messel采石场始新世沉积物中的被描述为Pleiogynium mitchellii Collinson， Manchester & Wilde的多房水果化石不属于该属，因为水果石背面上的长型凹陷的证据尚未得到结论性证实，其内部的形态/解剖学特征和Pleiogynium显著不同。Key words: PleiogyniumAnacardiaceaeoperculate fruitsPaleogene–NeogeneGlencoeRiversleighQueenslandAustralia.

Alcheringa 38, 541–545. ISSN 0311-5518.Tunnels and faecal pellets likely made by oribatid mites have been found in silicified conifer wood from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian–Turonian) portion of the Winton Formation, central-western Queensland, Australia. Although this is the first identified and described record of oribatid mites in the Mesozoic of Australia, other published, but unassigned material may also be referable to Oribatida. Current understanding of the climatic significance of mite distribution is limited, but the presence of oribatids and absence of xylophagus insects in the upper portion of the Winton Formation are consistent with indications that the environment in which this unit was deposited was relatively warm and wet for its palaeolatitude. Such traces may provide useful and durable proxy evidence of palaeoclimate, but more detailed investigation of modern taxa and their relationship to climate is still needed.Tamara L.

ISSN 0311-5518Knowledge of post-Eocene cetaceans from Africa is very poor with almost nothing known about this group from southern Africa except for the diverse trawled ziphiids. Langebaanweg, a locality yielding prolific Miocene–Pliocene fossils on the southwestern Cape coast of South Africa, preserves terrestrial and marine biotas in juxtaposition. Palaeoenvironments vary from a marine shoreline to a lagoon and estuary and later a shallow marine environment and include several microhabitats. Fragmentary preservation of the cetacean skeletons suggests that they were transported before burial. This first detailed analysis of the Mio-Pliocene mysticete fossils from Langebaanweg uses the petrotympanic region to taxonomically identify specimens. Three un-named species of balaenopterid Mysticeti represent a Plesiobalaenoptera-like form, but it is premature to erect a new taxon based on this fragmentary material. The remaining material is too poorly preserved to be identified with confidence.Romala Govender [rgovender@iziko.org.za], Natural History Department, Iziko Museums of South Africa, PO Box 61, Cape Town, 8001, South Africa; Biological Sciences, University of Cape Town, Private Bag X3, Rhodes Gift, 7701, Cape Town, South Africa, Michelangelo Bisconti [michelangelobisconti@gmail.com], Natural History Museum of San Diego, California, 1788 El Prado, San Diego, CA 92101, USA; Anusuya Chinsamy [anusuya.chinsamy-turan@uct.ac.za], Biological Sciences, University of Cape Town, Private Bag X3, Rhodes Gift, 7701, Cape Town, South Africa.",

We examined the only fossil ophiuroid yet known from the Falkland Islands and assess its significance for the evolution of the clade. This ophiuroid, herein distinguished as a new genus and species, Darwinaster coleenbiggsae, belongs to the same suprageneric group as Protaster, which was established on a series of Middle–Upper Ordovician taxa and persisted into the late Palaeozoic remarkably little changed in morphology. This single example is part of a much wider fauna that includes fossils from the Bokkeveld Group, South Africa and the Precordillera of Argentina.

Alcheringa 42, 67–86. ISSN 0311-5518.Palynological analysis was carried out on Middle to Upper Triassic strata from Tulong, Nyalam County, southern Xizang (Tibet), China. Well-preserved miospore (pollen and spore) assemblages and sparse acritarch occurrences were identified. We recognized four formal and one informal biozones based on stratigraphically important taxa and compositional changes through the succession, in ascending order: the Triplexisporites Interval Zone (Anisian), the Staurosaccites quadrifidus Taxon-range Zone (upper Anisian to lower Norian), the Striatella Interval Zone (lower Norian), the Craterisporites rotundus Taxon-range Zone (middle to upper Norian) and the informal ‘Dictyophyllidites harrisii zone’ (Rhaetian). The zonation was supported by marine fossils (e.g., ammonoids and conodonts), and compositional similarity between the zones was examined using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Correlation with other representative palynological sequences across Gondwana was also conducted. The presence of miospore taxa not previously recovered from the Late Triassic North and South China palynofloral provinces (e.g., Ashmoripollis reducta, Craterisporites rotundus, Enzonalasporites vigens, Minutosaccus crenulatus, Samaropollenites speciosus and Staurosaccites quadrifidus) calls for a new province in southwestern China, i.e., the Southern Xizang Province. It is proposed here that the modern expression of the northern boundary runs along the Yarlung Zangbo Suture, the remnant of the Tethys that separated the Indian Plate (southern Xizang) and the Lhasa Block during the Late Triassic. This new palynofloral province comprises typical elements of the Onslow Microflora, indicating the need for an extension of this microflora in southern Xizang, China.Jungang Peng [jgpeng@nigpas.ac.cn], Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China, Department of Palaeobiology, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm 104 05, Sweden; Jianguo Li* [jgli@nigpas.ac.cn], Key Laboratory of Economic Stratigraphy and Palaeogeography, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; Wenben Li [wenbenli@126.com], Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; Sam M.

ISSN 0311-5518.Bone bioerosions provide an important taphonomic record on fossils from continental deposits dating back to the late Paleozoic. The morphological diversity of bone bioerosions is especially high in vertebrate remains from the Late Cretaceous. Here we describe four morphotypes of bioeroson preserved on titanosaur dinosaur bones collected from the Maastrichtian Marília Formation of Brazil. These traces differ from previously described ichnotaxa, and include branching furrows and surface removal resembling insect bioerosions, channels with semicircular cross-sections consistent with either root etchings or insects, and bite traces left by vertebrates. Taphonomic sequencing shows that time-averaging was an important aspect in the genesis of the Marília Formation taphocoenosis and demonstrates that traces left on bones are significant tools for reconstructing Late Cretaceous ecosystems.Voltaire Dutra Paes Neto [voltairearts@gmail.com] and Heitor Francischini [heitorfrancischini@hotmail.com] Programa de Pós-Graduação em Geociências (PPGGEO), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Av.

ISSN 0311-5518.A new podocarpaceous conifer is described from the early Danian Salamanca Formation (southern Chubut, Patagonia, Argentina) based on compressions of leafy branches with cuticular remains. Kirketapel salamanquensis gen. et sp. nov. has amphistomatic, scale-like leaves with marginal frills distinguishable at the apex; stomata oriented randomly in relation to the major axis of the leaf with four to five subsidiary cells and extremely reduced Florin rings; and irregularly shaped epidermal cells. We compare K. salamanquensis with extant and extinct members of the imbricate-leaved podocarps, among which it closely resembles Florin’s Dacrydium group C genera (i.e., Lagarostrobos, Manoao, Lepidothamnus and Halocarpus). Among these genera, only Lepidothamnus has a living representative in South America, the Chilean L. fonkii, whose leaf macro- and micromorphological characters are described in detail for comparison. Overall, the Patagonian fossil species is most similar to the extant and extinct members of Lagarostrobos in its cuticular micromorphology; however, macromorphological characters, such as the leaf size, apex curvature and mode of flattening, clearly differentiate it from all four genera of Dacrydium group C. We include Kirketapel salamanquensis in a combined molecular and morphological phylogenetic analysis conducted under the maximum parsimony criterion. The new, early Paleocene fossil taxon is confidently recovered as part of the scale-leaved clade as defined herein, which also includes Halocarpus, Phyllocladus, Lepidothamnus, Parasitaxus, Lagarostrobos and Manoao, and it constitutes the oldest record known for the group by at least 17 million years as well as its first fossil occurrence outside Australasia, establishing a widespread Gondwanan history. Furthermore, based on its oldest locality of occurrence, K. salamanquensis shows that the divergence of the total group of the scale-leaved podocarps occurred by at least 65 million years ago, adding to the growing systematic knowledge of earliest Cenozoic macrofloras in the Southern Hemisphere.Ana Andruchow-Colombo [aandruchow@mef.org.ar] and Ignacio Escapa [iescapa@mef.org.ar] CONICET, Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio Av.

The Histiodella serrata, Histiodella holodentata and Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus biozones are recognized in the lower and middle part of the Goldwyer Formation, indicative of an early–middle Darriwilian age. This revised conodont biostratigraphy enables more precise correlation with North America and North and South China. Several biogeographically distinctive conodont species, most likely of North Chinese origin, are recorded from the Goldwyer Formation.

    "abstract": "Diverse freshwater green algal microfossils and dispersed fungal spores among rich terrestrial palynofloras were recovered from the upper part of the Quebrada de los Fósiles Formation, Puesto Viejo Group, cropping-out in the fault-bounded San Rafael Basin, Mendoza Province, Argentina. Sedimentological data suggest that the vegetation recorded from this unit grew in floodplains of high-sinuosity fluvial systems when intense episodic volcanic activity provided great quantities of ash deposits to the sites. Small and temporary shallow lake deposits and thin peat ponds were recorded at two sections, yielding palynofloras composed of variable contents of spores, pollen, freshwater algae and fungal associations. The taxa described and illustrated herein consist of representatives of colonial Chlorophyta algae (Botryococcus), a diverse group of Zygnematales zygospores represented by the genera Lecaniella, Maculatasporites, Mehlisphaeridium, Ovoidites and the incertae sedis algae Leiosphaeridia and Retirotundia as well as representatives of fungi assigned to Microsporonites and Portalites. Two new species of Ovoidites are described herein, Ovoidites tripartitus and Ovoidites circumplicatus, and the new combination Ovoidites scissus is also presented. The terrestrial and aquatic vegetation grew associated with shallow water bodies in floodplain environments developed under warm temperate, strongly seasonal climatic conditions. The environment was stressed by volcanism that probably restricted the colonization and development of the ecosystem. The occurrence of algal microfossils in the Quebrada de los Fósiles Formation suggest shallow and episodic locally restricted aquatic environments inhabited by autochthonous freshwater green algae consistent with the sedimentological evidence. A Middle Triassic age is inferred from recent radiometric dating obtained from the basal and upper ignimbrite beds of the Quebrada de los Fósiles Formation indicate an age of 243.9 ± 2.0 Ma and 235.8 ± 2.0 Ma, respectively, thus mostly constrained to the Ladinian age. The composition of the fossil flora (palynoflora and macroflora) also indicates Middle Triassic age.Ana M.

Alcheringa 39,559–572 ISSN 0311-5518The type section of the Mississippian Bei'an Formation is well exposed on both sides of the Beihuan expressway at Liuzhou in Guangxi, South China, about 700 m east of the Pengchong GSSP (Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point) for the base of the Visean Stage. Foraminifers are abundant and diverse (at least 59 species and 39 genera) in this section, and five foraminiferal zones are recognizable in the Bei'an Formation. In ascending order, these are the Pojarkovella nibelis, Koskinotextularia, Bradyina, Janischewskina and 'Millerella' tortula zones. Based on the foraminifers, the Bei'an Formation is regarded as being of middle Visean to Serpukhovian age, i.e., equivalent to biozones MFZ12–MFZ15 from the stratotypes of Europe, and the Visean–Serpukhovian boundary is placed at the base of the 'Millerella' tortula Zone.Yang Shen [shenybj@126.com] (Corresponding author) and Xun-Lian Wang [wxl@cugb.edu.cn], School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, PR China.",

Alcheringa 40, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518The extant plains vizcacha, Lagostomus maximus, is described from the Late Pleistocene (Dolores Formation) of Uruguay based on an almost complete articulated skeleton. It is compared with the nominally extinct Pleistocene species of the genus. An AMS 14C taxon-age is determined for L. maximus at 11 879 ± 95 years BP (cal. BP 13 898–13 941). Lagostomus maximus is absent from modern mammal communities in Uruguay, and no Holocene evidence is available. Because L. maximus exhibits remarkable sexual and ontogenetic dimorphism, we examined a range of juvenile, sub-adult and adult male and female specimens. It is not possible to differentiate the articulated Pleistocene fossil from sub-adult specimens of L. maximus based on this sample. Moreover, the skull characteristics, including a broad vertical ramus of the zygomatic arch, semi-circular temporal crest and short robust sagittal crest, most closely resemble extant female individuals. Molar size is non-predictive for ontogenetic stage or body mass because it reaches stability during early adulthood. Other fragmentary skull remains are herein assigned to L. sp. cf. L. maximus. Lagostomus cavifrons from the Pleistocene of Argentina is considered synonymous with L. maximus. Its character states concur with the range of intraspecific variability and it has been established on a young adult or adult male individual. Likewise, the other Argentinean Pleistocene species based on incomplete mandibles, L. angustidens, L. striatus, L. heterogenidens, L. egenus, L. minimus and L. debilis, concur with ontogenetic morphs and are here assigned to Lagostomus sp. The ecological preferences of extant L. maximus infer open arid or semi-arid landscapes for the latest Pleistocene of southern Uruguay. This hypothesis is reinforced by the coeval presence of Microcavia, Galea and small camelids in the same strata. The Last Glacial Maximum likely promoted this environmental setting. Latest Pleistocene or early Holocene climatic change might have facilitated local extinctions and/or range shifts among this mammal fauna.Martín Ubilla [martinubilla@gmail.com], Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Iguá 4225, 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay; Andrés Rinderknecht [apaleorinder@yahoo.com], Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, Paleontología, 11000, Montevideo, Uruguay.",

Currently two species are recognized: Dasycercus cristicauda and Dasycercus blythi, with the previously named Dasycercus hillieri considered a junior synonym of D. cristicauda. This investigation integrates modern, historical and subfossil material from across Australia to provide the most comprehensive review of the genus to date. Cranial and dental morphological characters that enable phylogenetic and morphometric analysis of taxa are established. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of craniodental measurements, including from the type specimens of named taxa (D. cristicauda, D. hillieri and D. blythi), are used to assess the validity of each taxon. The results confirm the validity of D. cristicauda and D. blythi as species, but also reconfirm the validity of D. hillieri. As a result, much of the modern ‘D. cristicauda’ material is reassigned to D. hillieri. Three new taxa are proposed: Dasycercus woolleyae sp. nov., Dasycercus archeri sp. nov. and Dasycercus marlowi sp. nov. These six Dasycercus species are distributed across Australia’s arid zone and beyond. Based on prior investigations and the results of this taxonomic review, it is likely that only D. hillieri and D. blythi are extant. The identification of four likely extinct taxa marks the first recorded instance of modern extinction within the family Dasyuridae.",

The articulate shoots are similar to Ephedra foliata and some other extant species with 3–4 decussate, basally connate leaves at each node, sunken stomata in intercostal zones, alternating large and small vascular bundles, paired leaf traces, and the morphology of tracheary elements, but differ in the leaf number per node ranging from two to eight and in the considerably lower ratio of leaves to internode vascular bundles. A new genus and species Leongathia elegans is described. The co-occurrence of gnetophytes and early angiosperms in the lower Aptian of Koonwarra is of certain evolutionary and palaeoecological significance.

The diversity and relative abundance of mesopelagic cyclopygids gradually increased southwards or seawards. According to the facies association exhibited in the region, the upper limit of living depth for different forms is inferred as follows: 1) more than 70 m (M. (Microparia)); 2) less than 100 m (M. (Quadratapyge), Pricyclopyge, Aspidaeglina); 3) at approximately 100 m (Cyclopyge); and 4) more than 100 m (Symphysops, Psilacella). Benthic forms were absent in the deep outer-shelf basin because of stagnant conditions. In shallower sites of the outer shelf, genera of nileids in the carbonate facies and raphiophorids in the clastic facies were relatively abundant, but some endemic forms, such as the asaphid Birmanites and remopleuridid Hexacopyge, became dominant during the late Llanvirn-early Caradoc. Rorringtoniids are mainly associated with deeper outer-shelf facies. Panderia is common in an early Llanvirn nileid fauna at Yichongqiao, Cili area, and may well indicate development of shelf carbonate buildups. A transgressive event is suggested by the sudden appearance of rich Cyclopyge in the early Caradoc at Jiuxi, Changde.",

The fourth and highest Visean zone has the mondial Gnathodus texanus and Gnathodus bilineatus as joint nominate species, the latter being included in the zonal name to emphasise the restricted definition we adopt for G. texanus. Adetognathus also probably evolved from Patrognathus to give a lineage of three new endemic species: — A. taphrognathoides, A. cannindahensis and A. subunicornis, all predating the earliest adetognathids of the northern continents. Cavusgnathus altifrons sp. nov. is intermediate in platform morphology and time-range between late Tournaisian Clydagnathus and late Mississippian species of Cavusgnathus; Synprioniodina? thompsoni sp. nov., likewise seems to be intermediate between S.? pulchra and Hindeodus cristula.

Approximate limits are indicated in the sequences of eastern Australia for the Lower (VI), Middle (V2) and Upper (V3) divisions of the Visean, account being taken of ages suggested in the recent literature on ammonoids, algae and foraminifera.

    "abstract": "A fauna of bivalves, many of them large and thick-shelled, occurs in the 50-metre-thick, clastic, Early Devonian Horlick Formation of the Ohio Range, Antarctica. Together with the ecology of other fossils, the bivalves indicate a high-energy, near-shore environment, with deposition strongly influenced by storm activity. The distribution of bivalves and other fossils is related to nine lithofacies. Most of the fauna comprises death assemblages. Thick external bryozoan growths on parts of certain bivalves and brachiopods suggest partial burial of shells during life. Other evidence indicates that some shells were exhumed and reburied. In terms of bottom communities, most of the fauna falls within Benthic Assemblages 1 and 2, and was close to shore, but the Australospirifer and crinoid-dominated fauna of lithofacies 8 at the top of the sequence indicates Benthic Assemblage 4 or 5, and lay further offshore. The fauna shows strong Malvinokaffric affinities and lesser connections with the Devonian of Reefton, New Zealand. Shallow water phosphate deposits that are anomalous for the latitudes proposed for the Ohio Range (58° S) may be explained by either higher global temperatures during the Devonian, or by post-Devonian strike-slip movement of the region. The fauna is numerically dominated by brachiopods, but taxonomically, bivalves are more varied and form a strong component in assemblages. The bivalves include infaunal, epifaunal and semi-infaunal forms. A suggested mode of life for each bivalve is included in the systematic section of this paper. Re-collection, and the restudy of existing material, has resulted in the establishment of two new genera and eight new species. The genus Notonucula has been proposed for Nuculoidea-like palaeotaxodonts that lack marginal micropectenations of the shell, and Obrimia for a new, large, thick-shelled genus that has been tentatively placed in the family Edmondiidae. New bivalve species include: Notonucula cuspidis, Notonucula demissa, Nuculites frigidus, Modiomorpha herculi, Obrimia hadrosa, Obrimia ovalis, Palaeosolen algidus, and Prothyris (Prothyris) darlingensis. Recorded for the first time from the Horlick Formation are Phestia cf. P. viator, Gosseletia? sp., Pterinea? sp., Glossites sp., and Orthonota sp.; also hyolithids and crinoid holdfasts.",

Based on specimens from 17 localities in the Yangtze region, the Exigraptus clavus and Undulograptus austrodentatus zones are recognised as replacements respectively of the Undulograptus sinodentatus (Lower) and U. austrodentatus (Upper) zones of Mu et al. (1979). The U. sinicus Subzone, the upper subzone of the U. austrodentatus Zone, is also recognised from the Sichuan-Guizhou area of the Yangtze region. Two subzones of the U. austrodentatus Zone have also been identified from the Chiadam region with more diverse graptolite fauna. The U. austrodentatus Zone fauna also occurs in the Alxa region. A general pattern of changing graptolite diversity from platform through basinal slope to deep basin is proposed, based on early Darriwilian bio- and lithofacies changes from the Yangtze Platform through the Jiangnan belt to the Zhujiang basin. The graptolite diversity increased with water depth and more off-shore setting. Key graptolite species are illustrated.",

The fossils occur through much of the succession, from the Cashions Creek Limestone and equivalents upwards, and from many different localities through west-central and northern Tasmania. A total of 16 species (6 new) of the Order Labechiida are described and illustrated from the sequences. They include the new species Stylostroma ugbrookense, S. bubsense, Aulacera denensis, A. gunnensis, Thamnobeatricea gouldi and T.? vesiculosa. The fauna also comprises representatives of Labechia, Stromatocerium, Labechiella, Pachystylostroma, Rosenella, Pseudostylodictyon, Cystostroma and Alleynodictyon. A number of cyanobacterial associations are also described, including occurrences of Labechiella variabilis with its normal pillars colonized by Cliefdenia-like clusters, and Cystostroma involved in sheet-like intergrowths with an unnamed cyanobacterium resembling Epiphyton. In general the stromatoporoid occurrences are in deposits interpreted as of shallow subtidal to possibly intertidal origin. Stromatocerium bigsbyi assemblages characterize the lower part (Cashions Creek Limestone and equivalents) of the Gordon Group, Thamnobeatricea to Stylostroma associations the middle part (Lower Limestone Member of the Benjamin Limestone and correlatives), and Pachystylostroma, Aulacera and clathrodictyid-dominated assemblages the top (uppermost part of the Benjamin Limestone and equivalents). The early assemblages have closest biogeographic relationships with North America but higher in the sequence affinities seem to be mainly Asian but also with some North American links. Species such as Rosenella woyuensis, Labechiella regularis and L. variabilis have been recorded previously from central New South Wales, North China (all three species), Malaysia (only the last two), and Kazakhstan (only the first two). In contrast, the cylindrical Aulacera and Thamnobeatricea are more typical of the North American fauna.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Environmentally-related wear conditions and pathologies affecting the dentition of fossil lungfish from freshwater deposits in Australia have been analysed and compared with similar changes in the dentition of the living Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsten. Fossil populations from the Namba, Etadunna, Wipajiri and Katipiri formations in central Australia, and the Carl Creek Limestone and the Camfield beds in northern Australia were assessed. Tooth plates from populations of living lungfish from the Brisbane River and Enoggera Reservoir in southeast Queensland were analysed for comparison. Tooth plates were measured to determine the numbers of different age groups in each population. They were assessed for abrasion, attrition, spur and step wear, erosion and caries, and for trauma and pathological conditions such as malocclusion, hyperplasia, abscesses, osteopenia and parasitic damage. AH of these conditions are related to the environment where the fish lived, are found in living members of the group, and can be compared directly with those of fossil relatives. The results suggest that some of the fossil populations were at risk before climatic changes late in the Cainozoic destroyed their habitats. Some fossil lungfish populations, such as those of the Wipajiri Formation, exhibit active spawning and recruitment, good growth rates and a low incidence of disease and environmentally related damage to the tooth plates. Others, like those of the Katipiri and Namba Formations, include no young, and the adult fish were ageing and show environmentally-related damage to the dentition. Etadunna lungfish had active recruitment, but the tooth plates show a high incidence of attrition and caries. Riversleigh lungfish were actively spawning but did not grow large. Tooth plates from this latter deposit have a high incidence of pathological conditions. Fish from the Camfield Beds, where food was severely limiting, had little serious pathology but high levels of caries. Pathologies among living lungfish are common, but fossil fish were comparatively healthy, with few serious dental problems. Information from studies of fossil lungfish confirms that conservation of the few living species of lungfish depends on the maintenance of clean environments that provide adequate supplies of food and suitable sites for spawning and for the growth of young fish.

Ammonoid abundance is low at all stratigraphic levels. Nowhere are more than 20 specimens known at a locality, and usually there are only one or two. The group is too sparse to be used for local or regional correlation, and its main value is for the intercontinental correlation of a number of well separated horizons. The rocks dated range in age from middle Tournaisian (Tn2a) to late Visean V3c). Some relatively minor differences between ammonoid and conodont ages remain to be resolved. The biogeography is briefly discussed. The type specimens of all available previously described species have been examined and where necessary they are re-illustrated. New species described are Irinoceras tuba, Muensteroceras jenkinsi, M. delepinei, M. merlewoodense, Beyrichoceras mackellari, B. bootibootiense, Nomismoceras pseudocyclus, Goniatites mundubberensis, G. cuniculus, Protocanites careyi, and Cantabricanites jelli.

This report represents the first detailed study of silicified wood from Victoria. The wood was part of a large trunk collected at the Jungle Creek location, approximately 30 km NNW of Buchan in eastern Gippsland, and is probably of late Eocene-Early Oligocene age (39 million years). The wood is diffuse porous and consists of vessels, fibres, xylem and ray parenchyma and oil cells. The vessels have simple, elongate pits on walls in contact with parenchyma and fibre walls and bordered pits on walls in contact with adjacent vessels. Oil cells are the most distinctive feature of the wood and are filled with oil droplets. The fossil wood has many similarities to the genus Cryptocarya in the family Lauraceae, but it seems appropriate to assign it to a new genus and species, Cryptocaryoxylon gippslandicum. C. gippslandicum thus adds a new dimension to our knowledge of Australian Tertiary floras.",

Stratigraphically, the Arcoona Quartzite Member is thought to be the equivalent of the ABC Range Quartzite of the Flinders Ranges, which underlies metazoan-bearing sandstones of the Pound Subgroup but overlies recently discovered animal fossils of the basal Wilpena Group. The ABC Quartzite is included in the stratotype of the Ediacarian System proposed by Cloud & Glaessner (1982). The Arcoona assemblage thus provides an excellent opportunity for microfossil-based biostratigraphic characterization of sequences containing the earliest invertebrate biotas. Arcoona microfossils illustrate well both the problems and potential of Precambrian micropalaeontology. The morphologic complexity and diversity of the leiosphaerids is limited; however, the assemblage as a whole compares closely with microbiotas of late Vendian age from the Georgina Basin in northern Australia and the Nama Group in Namibia, as well as with several localities in the Northern Hemisphere. The assemblage described here differs from phytoplankton assemblages of both late Riphean and Cambrian age found in many other parts of the world.",

Fourteen bryozoan species are described from the Campanian – Maastrichtian Kahuitara Tuff of Pitt Island, substantially increasing the known diversity in this deposit from the two species recorded previously and making it the most diverse bryozoan biota yet described from the Cretaceous of Australasia. Nine of the Kahuitara Tuff bryozoans are cyclostomes, four are cheilostomes, and one is a shell-boring ctenostome. Seven new species are described: Ceriocava hakepaensis sp. nov., Tholopora australis sp. nov., Crisidmonea lanauzeorum sp. nov., Cookobryozoon cretacea sp. nov., Chiplonkarina preeceorum sp. nov. Chiplonkarina bifoliata sp. nov. and Aechmella rangiauriensis sp. nov. The remaining species are left in open nomenclature because of preservational deficiencies or lack of taxon-diagnostic gonozooids. The ctenostome family Cookobryozoidae is subsumed in the Terebriporidae. The new family Chiplonkarinidae is proposed for anascan cheilostomes previously assigned to the paraphyletic Electridae and distinguished by having primarily erect colonies with long, tubular zooids reminiscent of stenolaemates. None of the Kahuitara Tuff bryozoan species is known elsewhere, but all apart from one genus occur in roughly coeval deposits. No families regarded as particularly characteristic of the austral post-Cretaceous are evident.

Anatomically preserved stems of Late Triassic corystosperms from the upper Cortaderita Formation in San Juan province, Argentina are described and assigned to Rhexoxylon cortaderitaense (Menéndez) comb. nov. These specimens were originally attributed to conifers, a group not closely related to corystosperms. The silicified axes preserve features of the cortex, pith, and secondary vascular system. Like all Rhexoxylon species, these axes have two discontinuous cambial rings that develop centrifugal secondary xylem (normal secondary xylem) and centripetal secondary xylem (inverted secondary xylem). Both types of xylem are separated by a band of parenchymatous tissue developed by a remnant cambium. The centrifugal xylem is divided by parenchymatous rays following differential cambial activity. The secondary xylem is pycnoxylic with uniseriate rays; tracheids have mainly biseriate and alternate bordered pits on radial and tangential walls, and one simple oval pit in cross-fields. The distinctive feature of R. cortaderitaense is the conspicuous amount of centripetal secondary vascular tissues not forming perimedullar bundles, this being interpreted as an apomorphic trait. This interpretation of the character modifies previous hypothesized phylogenetic relationships of corystosperm wood taxa.

This contribution describes new fossil insect taxa from the early Late Triassic Potrerillos Formation (lower section), at quebrada del puente, Cerro Bayo, Mendoza Province, Argentina. A new family, three new genera, and four new species of Blattoptera are described: Anablatta compacta gen. et sp. nov., Potrerilloblatta stipanicici gen. et sp. nov.

(Permosynidae Tillyard). These findings extend the stratigraphic distribution of the typical Triassic coleopteran taxa. The new assemblage shares the genus Lariojablatta with the Los Rastros fauna. The Blattoptera and Coleoptera genera differ from those typical of the Australian and South African Triassic biota (Ademosyne for Coleoptera and Triassoblatta and Samaroblatta for Blattoptera) and appear to be endemic to Argentina (Delpuentesyne, Potrerilloblatta and Delpuenteblatta).",

    "abstract": "A morphometric analysis based on 16 landmarks (specific geometric points) identified on the skull roof of different growth stages of various temnospondyls revealed patterns of shape change during ontogeny. Data from 50 individuals from 12 taxa, encompassing euskelians (dissorophoids, eryopids and zatracheids) and stereospondylomorphs were plotted in a morphospace diagram defined by two principal-component axes (PC 1 and PC 2) of a principal-component analysis of the shape variables. The morphospace occupation reflects phylogenetic relationships of the main clades of temnospondyls. All stereospondylomorphs investigated here have similar ontogenetic trajectories with long intervals on PC 1. Eryopids and zatracheids have shortened their trajectories on PC 1 and are separated in morphospace relative to the stereospondylomorphs and dissorophoids. Outgroup comparison with Cochleosaurus bohemicus (Frič, 1876 Frič, A. 1876. Über die Fauna der Gaskohle des Pilsner und Rakonitzer Beckens. Sitzungsberichte der Königlichen Böhmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, 1875: 70–79. [Google Scholar]) suggests that a long ontogenetic trajectory with gradual development represents the plesiomorphic condition for temnospondyls. More derived stereospondylomorphs (among the taxa considered here, but excluding groups such as derived rhytidosteids and brachyopoids) increased the length of their trajectories on PC 1 and show a peramorphic pattern, resulting in the long and slender skull of piscivorous predators. Dissorophoids exhibit truncated ontogenetic trajectories and occupy the morphospace region of larval stereospondylomorphs, thus attaining a paedomorphic appearance probably by hypomorphosis. Amphibamid and branchiosaurid dissorophoids have clearly distinguishable larval and postlarval developments, indicating that these forms had evolved a lissamphibian-like type of metamorphosis.",

    "abstract": "The Ordovician diversification is marked by an increase in both marine diversity and ecospace occupation. Bivalves, like other groups, underwent a remarkable diversification in the Early Ordovician. The early phases of such a bivalve diversification took place in the Gondwanan basins of western Argentina. In the Northwestern Argentina (NWA) Basin, three clades originated during late Tremadocian–Floian times. In the Floian successions of the Famatina Basin, a probable basal arcoid is recorded. Genera from these two basins belong to 13 families. Phylogenetic analysis of the NWA heteroconchian bivalves indicates that redoniids and coxiconchinids may have originated during this radiation event. This taxonomic radiation also implies an ecological diversification. Ten guilds are recognized on the basis of bauplan, mode of life, and feeding types. Lifestyles included free endofaunal, free semi-endofaunal, semi-endobyssate, and epibyssate; feeding types included suspensivorous and detritivorous habits. Physiological changes imposed by colonization of low-salinity environments also account for guild definitions. Recent discoveries of Tremadoc to early Darriwilian bivalves from the NWA and Famatina basins indicate that the dominance of higher groups (e.g. Heteroconchia, Pteriomorphia) deviates from the patterns evident in other Gondwanan basins. This agrees with previous ideas supporting the importance of local radiations during the Ordovician diversification. Two new taxa are described, Eoredonia orientalis gen. et sp. nov. and Babinka notica sp. nov., and Coxiconchia sellaensis Sánchez & Babin is first reported from the NWA Basin.",

The excellent state of preservation of the Riversleigh material has enabled a description of diagnostic features of the palate, dentary and dentition previously not possible from the badly fractured holotype. In light of this new material, a reanalysis of the single known dentary of Bematherium angulum from Riversleigh's Site C (Tedford 1967 Tedford, R. H. 1967. Fossil mammal remains from the Tertiary Carl Creek Limestone, north-western Queensland. Bulletin of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, 92: 217–236. [Google Scholar]), suggests B. angulum is a junior synonym of N. bonythoni, a relationship first proposed tentatively by Archer (1984 Archer, M. 1984. \"The Australian marsupial radiation\". In Vertebrate Zoogeography and Evolution in Australasia, Edited by: Archer, M. and Clayton, G. 633–808. Perth: Hesperian Press. [Google Scholar]). Few morphological differences (apart from size) distinguish N. bonythoni from its smaller congeneric N. tedfordi. Despite this similarity in form, the abundance of N. bonythoni, and the absence of any smaller forms such as N. tedfordi at Riversleigh, supports the recognition of two distinct species in Ngapakaldia. The shared presence of Ngapakaldia bonythoni in several Faunal Zone A local faunas at Riversleigh, and the Ngapakaldi Local Fauna (Zone C) of the Etadunna Formation, lends further support to a late Oligocene age for these deposits.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe White Point Conglomerate at Cape d'Estaing, Kangaroo Island, South Australia contains a polymict suite of transported clasts up to boulder size, including archaeocyath-bearing limestone clasts. Reef boundstone and bioclast floatstone and rudstone textures are evident among the limestones. The formation is a constituent of the Kangaroo Island Group, exposed along the central northern coast of the island. A total of 32 species of archaeocyaths, one radiocyath and one acanthinocyathide are described from sampled clasts. New taxa are the ethmocyathid Ussuricyathellus bellidoi sp. nov. and the sajanocyathid Emucyathus elinorae gen. et sp. nov. The assemblage correlates with the post–Flinders Unconformity interval elswhere in the Stansbury Basin and in the Arrowie Basin to the north, and indicates a late Botoman age in terms of the Siberian Cambrian stage scale. A substantial proportion of species in common between the Cape d'Estaing assemblage and the Koolywurtie Limestone Member fauna on Yorke Peninsula confirm that the latter unit is the likely source for the archaeocyath-bearing limestone clasts in the White Point Conglomerate. In contrast, there are no species in common between the Cape d'Estaing assemblage and that of the upper Sellick Hill Formation and lower Fork Tree Limestone on Fleurieu Peninsula.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FC416BB7-F7CF-403E-8343-D98214726CE9南澳大利亚袋鼠岛d'Estaing海角White Point砾岩包含大如巨石的搬运碎屑的复矿碎屑岩岩套, 包括含古杯类的石灰石碎屑。礁灰岩和生物碎屑浮石及砾状灰岩纹理在灰岩中显而易见。这样的岩组组成袋鼠岛群, 沿岛的中北部海岸出露。从采样碎屑中, 一共有32个古杯动物种, 一个辐杯种和一个刺杯种被描述。新分类群是ethmocyathid Ussuricyathellus bellidoi sp. nov.和sajanocyathid Emucyathus elinorae gen. et sp. nov。该组合与Stansbury 盆地其它地区的和往北Arrowie盆地的后弗林德斯不整合间隔相对比, 根据西伯利亚寒武纪阶的划分, 指示其年龄为Botoman阶晚期。D'Estaing海角组合和约克半岛Koolywurtie灰岩段动物群之间有相当比例的共同种, 这点证实, 后者可能是单位在White Point砾岩中含古杯石灰石碎屑的来源地。与此相反, 在d'Estaing海角组合和Fleurieu半岛上的Sellick Hill组上部及Fork Tree灰岩下部的组合之间不存在共同种。Key words: archaeocyathCambrianStansbury BasinWhite Point ConglomerateSouth Australiataxonomybiostratigraphy AcknowledgementsThis paper is a publication of Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) project CGL2009–07073, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.

A plated dinosaur (Ornithischia, Stegosauria) from the Early Cretaceous of Argentina, South America: an evaluation. Alcheringa, 1–14. ISSN 0311-5518. A re-evaluation of several vertebrae and dermal plates from the Lower Cretaceous (La Amarga Formation, Puesto Antigual Member; Barremian–lower Aptian) of Neuquén in Argentina, originally described as a stegosaurian dinosaur and recently referred to an indeterminate ornithischian, confirms the former identification. The Neuquén remains have a combination of features that is only known among stegosaurs: cervical vertebrae with a proportionally large cross-section of the neural canal, the anterior height and width of which are half the height of the anterior centrum, as in the cervical vertebrae of Kentrosaurus, Dacentrurus and Stegosaurus; prominent lateral depressions on the cervical centra, as in the presacral vertebrae of Dacentrurus; and cervical dermal plates that are subtriangular, longer than high and reminiscent of those of Miragaia. Moreover, a small bone here interpreted to be an anterior supraorbital (= first palpebral) is similar to that of Stegosaurus and other stegosaurs in having an elongate form and a dorsal rugose surface. The remains from Argentina exhibit some differences relative to other stegosaurs, suggesting that it is potentially a distinct taxon, but their incompleteness advises against the erection of a new genus and species. Interestingly, it is the only known skeletal record of Stegosauria in South America. It provides the second conclusive evidence of the presence of this clade in the Early Cretaceous of the Gondwanan landmasses.",

Herein we use the ichnology of the Stairway Sandstone to reveal insights into the shallow marine habitat of these early vertebrates, and compare it with that of other known pteraspidomorph-bearing localities from across Gondwana. The Stairway Sandstone contains a diverse Ordovician ichnofauna including 22 ichnotaxa of Arenicolites, Arthrophycus, Asterosoma, Cruziana, Didymaulichnus, Diplichnites, Diplocraterion, ?Gordia, Lockeia, Monocraterion, Monomorphichnus, Phycodes, Planolites, Rusophycus, Skolithos and Uchirites. These ichnofauna provide a well-preserved example of a typical Ordovician epeiric sea assemblage, recording the diverse ethologies of tracemakers in a very shallow marine environment of flashy sediment accumulation and regularly shifting sandy substrates. New conodont data refine the age of the Stairway Sandstone to the early Darriwilian, with ichnostratigraphic implications for the Cruziana rugosa group and Arthrophycus alleghaniensis.",

Alcheringa 37, 207-219. ISSN 0311-5518. A heterogenous and well-preserved assemblage of Triassic plants, including pteridophytes and gymnosperms, is described from the Lashly Formation of the Allan Hills, South Victoria Land, Antarctica. The pteridophytes include the sphenopsids Calamites aliwalensis, unidentified calamitalean axes, Neocalamites carreri and Neocalamites sp. The gymnosperms include Corystospermales, Peltaspermales and Pinales. Corystosperms dominate the megafloral assemblage and include Dicroidium odontopteroides, D. crassinervis, D. fremouwensis, D. coriaceum subsp. dutoitii, together with a microsporangiate structure Pteruchus sp. Peltaspermales include microsporangiate and ovuliferous reproductive structures namely Townrovia polaris and Matatiella dejerseyi, respectively. Conifers are represented by Heidiphyllum elongatum foliage and an unidentified cone. The megafossil assemblage is similar to those recorded from the late Early Triassic of New South Wales and Antarctica, Middle Triassic of Argentina, New Zealand and southeast Queensland, Middle to Late Triassic of South Africa, India, northern Argentina and Australia, early to middle Late Triassic of the central Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica, and Late Triassic of Chile and North Victoria Land, East Antarctica. The records of Calamites aliwalensis, Neocalamites carreri, Dicroidium fremouwensis, Pteruchus sp., Townrovia polaris, Matatiella dejerseyi and a conifer cone are the first of these taxa from the Allan Hills. Recent finds from the Permian beds of India and Jordan indicate a much earlier origin of Dicroidium than previously suspected. Persistence of greenhouse conditions from the end of the Permian through the Triassic allowed the rich and diverse Dicroidium forests to develop in the polar regions of Antarctica.

Gastroliths associated with a juvenile elasmosaur (Plesiosauria, Elasmosauridae) from the Snow Hill Island Formation (upper Campanian–lower Maastrichtian), Vega Island, Antarctica. Alcheringa 36, 531–541. ISSN 0311-5518. One of the unresolved problems concerning the palaeobiology of plesiosaurs is the function of gastroliths. A new juvenile specimen referred to Elasmosauridae indet., collected from the Cape Lamb Member of the Snow Hill Island Formation (upper Campanian–lower Maastrichtian) from Cape Lamb, Vega Island, Antarctic Peninsula with gastroliths, provides the opportunity to add information about this issue. The specimen consists of approximately 20% of a partially articulated skeleton including 333 gastroliths. Taphonomic evidence indicates rapid burial and possibly different taphonomic pathways for the dorsal (articulated) and caudal (disarticulated) regions. Analysis of the 333 gastroliths determined the mean major axis to be 14.32 mm, the mean maximum projection sphericity to be 0.7 and the standard deviation to be 1.1. Following Krumbein classification, most of the gastroliths are disk-shaped (35.4%), spheroid (34%) and cylindrical (21.3%). According to Powers's categories, most of the gastroliths are rounded (71.2%). Petrographically, the gastroliths that are larger than 15 mm (major axis) are mostly volcanic rhyolites (78.3%) and fine-grained quartz aggregates (11.6%); together with minor granitic rocks (3.1%), mudstones (3.1%) and aphanitic volcanics (3.9%); similar percentages were present among the smaller clasts. The acidic volcanic clasts likely derive from the volcanic Antarctic Peninsula Group (GPVA; Middle–Upper Jurassic). The mean values for sphericity and oblate-prolate index (OP index) indicate a fluvial origin for the gastroliths. The method of estimation of the maximum prey-size using gastroliths is discussed. The available data provides evidence against the hydrostatic function of the gastroliths because the total weight of the gastroliths is insufficient to modify the hydrostatic balance of the juvenile plesiosaur.

New specimens of the logrunner Orthonyx kaldowinyeri (Passeriformes: Orthonychidae) from the Oligo-Miocene of Australia. Alcheringa 38, 000–000. ISSN 0311–5518.Logrunners (Orthonychidae) are a family of ground-dwelling passerines that are endemic to the Australo-Papuan region. These peculiar birds are part of an ancient Australo-Papuan radiation that diverged basally in the oscine tree. Here we describe eight fossil tarsometatarsi of the logrunner Orthonyx kaldowinyeri, and a distal tibiotarsus tentatively assigned to this species from sites in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, Australia. The new fossil material ranges in age from late Oligocene to early late Miocene, and extends the temporal range of the Orthonychidae into the late Oligocene; this is the geologically oldest record of the family. These specimens also include the oldest Cenozoic passerine fossils from Australia that can be confidently referred to an extant family. The distinctive features of the tarsometatarsus and tibiotarsus of extant logrunners, which are probably related to their unusual method of foraging, are also present in O. kaldowinyeri. Assuming that O. kaldowinyeri had vegetation requirements similar to those of extant logrunners, its presence in various Riversleigh sites provides clues about the palaeoenvironment of these sites.Jacqueline M.T.

Metaceratodus kaopen comb. nov. and M. wichmanni comb. nov., two Late Cretaceous South American species of an austral lungfish genus (Dipnoi). Alcheringa 36, 203–216. ISSN 0311-5518. Metaceratodus wollastoni, an Australian species, was reported from Upper Cretaceous beds of Patagonia in 1997. Later, three new species (Ceratodus wichmanni, Ptychoceratodus kaopen and Ptychoceratodus cionei), based on scarce material, were described from the same region. Two of these species were later referred to Ferganoceratodus. After examining much more abundant and better-preserved material, we conclude that neither the occurrence of Metaceratodus wollastoni nor those of Ptychoceratodus and Ferganoceratodus in the Cretaceous of South America are supported. We consider that C. wichmanni and P. cionei are synonyms and we reassign the three putative species to Metaceratodus under two new combinations: M. kaopen comb. nov. and M. wichmanni comb. nov. Both differ from the other species of the genus in having pits over most of the occlusal surface and a different occlusal profile of the tooth plate, and most have four ridges in the lower and upper tooth plates. Metaceratodus wichmanni differs from M. kaopen in oclussal profile, inner angle, and symphysis development among other features. Metaceratodus kaopen is known from the upper Santonian–lower Campanian Anacleto Formation of Río Negro province and M. wichmanni from upper Campanian–lower Maastrichtian units of Chubut, Río Negro, Neuquén and Mendoza provinces, Argentina. The occurrence of Metaceratodus in southern South America corroborates a close biogeographical relationship with Australia in the latest Cretaceous.

ISSN 0311-5518. The holotype of the nominal lamniform shark 'Pseudoisurus' vraconensis comprises an isolated tooth from a late Albian stratum at Besakty, Mangyshlak, Kazakhstan. Its stratigraphical provenance indicates that it is of Mortoniceras perinflatum Zone-age or somewhat older. It is indistinguishable at the species level from isolated teeth from the Mortoniceras rostratum Zone of the Pawpaw Shale in northeast Texas. Abundant teeth of 'P'. vraconensis-type from slightly younger strata close to the Albian–Cenomanian boundary at Kolbay, eastern Mangyshlak, Kazakhstan, enabled the reconstruction of a dentition adhering to the dental blueprint of Cretoxyrhina, clarifying the generic identity of 'P'. vraconensis. In the Kolbay population, the distal lobe of the root on the three probable third upper anterior teeth at hand is not labiolingually compressed relative to the mesial lobe. Labiolingual flattening of the root lobe facing the mesial side of the intermediate bar is a characteristic feature of modern lamnids and may reflect limited accommodation space for a thick root lobe to form at the distal margin of the anterior hollow. An intermediate bar adds structural strength to the anterior part of the palatoquadrate while isolating the upper anterior teeth, facilitating deep penetration by their enlarged cusps. Individuals of Cretoxyrhina from the late Coniacian to earliest Campanian Smoky Hill Chalk in Kansas display a strongly disjunct heterodonty in the anterior half of the upper jaw dentition. This so-called 'lamnoid tooth pattern' is regarded by some researchers as a synapomorphy of the Lamniformes. The dwarfed teeth creating the 'lamnoid tooth pattern' in Smoky Hill Chalk individuals are seemingly matched by relatively larger, corresponding teeth in the 15 million years older C. vraconensis. The probable weakening of the disjunct upper jaw heterodonty in Cretoxyrhina with increasing geological age indicates that the 'lamnoid tooth pattern' might have evolved independently in two or more lamniform clades.",

Vera, Millerocaulis tekelili sp. nov. is defined, based on several permineralized stems recovered from exposures of the Lower Cretaceous Cerro Negro Formation on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. This new species is characterized by the presence of an ectophloic–dictyoxylic siphonostele, inner parenchymatic and outer sclerotic cortices, heterogeneous sclerotic ring in the petiole bases, absence of sclerenchyma associated with the petiolar xylem trace, petiolar inner cortex with sclerenchyma strands and stipular wings having a large sclerenchyma bundle and several smaller ones. The presence of non-homogeneous sclerotic rings in the petiole bases allows this new species to be clearly distinguished from other Antarctic Millerocaulis, and suggests that it may represent an intermediate form in the evolutionary lineage leading from Millerocaulis to subgenus Claytosmunda of Osmunda.",

Cornia martinsnetoi sp. nov., the first spinicaudatan from Permian–Triassic continental sequences of southern South America, is described. The new species has characters diagnostic of the typical late Palaeozoic–Early Triassic subfamily Vertexiinae from Gondwana. This new taxon was found in tuffaceous siltstones in the upper part of the Quebrada de los Fósiles Formation (Puesto Viejo Group), which may span the Permo-Triassic boundary in Argentina. The lower and coarser-grained interval of the Quebrada de los Fósiles Formation was deposited in distal alluvial fans and low- to high-sinuosity rivers. The upper fine-grained interval of this formation, which hosts the spinicaudatans and associated fossils (ostracods, megaspores, fish scales), was deposited in shallow floodplain lakes. Intense volcanic activity influenced the sedimentary evolution of this succession and was accompanied by aridification and some climatic seasonality that likely generated stressful conditions for the biota.

Permian non-marine bivalves of the Falkland Islands and their palaeoenvironmental significance. Alcheringa 36, 543–554. ISSN 0311-5518. We describe the occurrence of non-marine bivalves in exposures of the Middle Permian (Capitanian) Brenton Loch Formation on the southern shore of Choiseul Sound, East Falklands. The bivalves are associated with ichnofossils and were collected from a bed in the upper part of the formation, within a 25 cm thick interval of dark siltstones and mudstones with planar lamination, overlain by massive sandstones. The shells are articulated, with the valves either splayed open or closed. At the top of the succession, mudstone beds nearly 1.5 m above the bivalve-bearing layers yielded well-preserved Glossopteris sp. cf. G. communis leaf fossils. The closed articulated condition of some shells indicates preservation under high sedimentation rates with low residence time of bioclasts at the sediment/water interface. However, the presence of specimens with splayed shells is usually correlated to the slow decay of the shell ligament in oxygen-deficient bottom waters. The presence of complete carbonized leaves of Glossopteris associated with the bivalve-bearing levels also suggests a possibly dysoxic-anoxic bottom environment. Overall, our data suggest that the bivalves were preserved by abrupt burial, possibly by distal sediment flows into a Brenton Loch lake, and may represent autochthonous to parautochthonous fossil accumulations. The shells resemble those of anthracosiids and are herein assigned to Palaeanodonta sp. aff. P. dubia, a species also found in the Permian succession of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Our results confirm that (a) the true distributions in space and time of all Permian non-marine (freshwater) bivalves are not yet well known, and (b) there is no evidence for marine conditions in the upper part of the Brenton Loch Formation.",

Carboniferous postglacial faunas in the late Serpukhovian–Bashkirian interval of central-western Argentina. Alcheringa, ISSN 0311-5518.Typical glacial–postglacial sequences associated with the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) are recognized in the Calingasta-Uspallata Basin, central-western Argentina, particularly in the Hoyada Verde and El Paso formations (late Serpukhovian–Bashkirian) at Barreal Hill (San Juan province). Brachiopods and bivalves accompanied by gastropods, conulariids, nautiloids, corals and ostracods constitute the marine assemblages of the El Paso Formation. They are assigned to the Aseptella–Tuberculatella/Rhipidomella–Micraphelia (AT/RM) fauna, characterized by two fossil assemblages: Aseptella–Tuberculatella, identified in the lower fossiliferous interval, and Rhipidomella–Micraphelia in the upper. The development of the different invertebrate assemblages within the El Paso Formation, and their relationship with coeval suite in the Hoyada Verde Formation, can be explained by a complex array of abiotic factors (substrate stability, turbidity, nutrient availability, variation in oxygen levels, poor circulation and salinity variations in the water column) that were directly related to glacial retreat dynamics and coastal configuration. A restricted palaeofjord setting is proposed for the depositional environment of the El Paso Formation in contrast to an exposed open marine coast with a gently sloping shelf for the Hoyada Verde Formation. The study of the postglacial fauna of the El Paso Formation and its relationship with the Levipustula fauna in the Calingasta-Uspallata Basin, help determine the main controls on the distribution of the postglacial faunas in other late Palaeozoic South American basins, such as the Tepuel Genoa Basin in Patagonia and the Tarija Basin in Bolivia.Gabriela A.

Utilizing U–Pb CA-TIMS dating to calibrate the Middle to Late Jurassic spore-pollen zonation of the Surat Basin, Australia to the geological time-scale. Alcheringa XX, xx-xx.Spore-pollen palynostratigraphy is commonly used to subdivide and correlate Jurassic continental successions in eastern Australia and thus aid the construction of geological models for the petroleum and coal industries. However, the current spore-pollen framework has only been tenuously calibrated to the geological time-scale. Age determinations are reliant on indirect correlations of ammonite and dinoflagellate assemblages from New Zealand, the North West Shelf of Australia and Southeast Asia to the standard European stages. New uranium-lead chemical abrasion thermal ionization mass spectrometry (U–Pb CA-TIMS) dates from 19 tuff beds in the Middle–Upper Jurassic Injune Creek Group of the Surat Basin enables regional spore-pollen palynostratigraphic zones to be precisely dated for the first time. These results show the base of the APJ4.2 and APJ4.3 subzones are similar in age to previous estimates (Middle Jurassic, Bathonian) from indirect palynostratigraphic correlation. However, the base of the APJ5 Zone and the APJ6.1 Subzone may be somewhat younger than previously estimated, possibly by as much as 2.5 and 4.2 Myrs, respectively. The continued utilization of U–Pb CA-TIMS dates will further refine the absolute ages of these zones, improve the inter- and intra-basinal correlation of Middle–Upper Jurassic strata in eastern Australian basins and greatly enhance intercontinental correlations.Carmine Christopher Wainman [carmine.wainman@adelaide.edu.au] and Peter James McCabe [peter.mccabe@adelaide,edu.au] Australian School of Petroleum, University of Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia; Carey Hannaford [carey.hannaford@mgpalaeo.com.au] and Daniel Mantle [dan.mantle@mgpalaeo.com.au] MGPalaeo Pty Ltd, 5 Arvida Street, Malaga, WA, 6090, WA, Australia.",

ISSN 0311-5518Eocene penguins are known mostly from Antarctic specimens. A previously documented partial skeleton consisting of a pelvis, femur, tibiotarsus and fibula, from the middle Eocene Leticia Formation, Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina, has been prepared and re-described. Re-analysis favours assignment to Palaeeudyptes gunnari, a species widely recorded in the Eocene of Antarctica. A new isolated coracoid belonging to an indeterminate species reveals new information about diving kinematics and swimming abilities. Palaeobiological attributes and morphology of the fossils indicate that both specimens belonged to large penguins with poor diving capability and wing propulsion systems similar to those of extant taxa. These penguin remains are the only vertebrate fossils thus far recorded from the Leticia Formation, and provide important insights into the relationships of South American and Antarctic penguins during the Paleogene. The presence of Palaeeudyptes in Argentina supports an Eocene connection between the South American and Antarctic penguin faunas.Carolina Acosta Hospitaleche [acostacaro@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar], CONICET.

A total of 34 angiosperm species from the collection were reviewed and taxonomically updated, with Nothofagus as the dominant genus. The taxa identified indicate a warm and humid climate with the development of some elements of a cool-temperate climate marked by a transitional climate change to cooler conditions.

ISSN 0311-5518.This work forms the concluding part of a series of systematic studies of typical Gondwanan Permian palynofloras from the type section of the La Veteada Formation in the Paganzo Basin, central-western Argentina. It deals with the description and/or illustration of the non-taeniate monosaccate, bisaccate and polysaccate gymnosperm pollen species that are richly represented in the La Veteada Formation and are attributed to 25 genera. These taxa are allied to, or derived from, a diverse range pteridosperms (corystosperms, peltasperms), conifers (including Voltziales) and cordaites; Ginkgoales, Cycadales and Gnetales also have some representation. The new species, Jugasporites vellicoites, is instituted and the new combination, Alisporites angustus (Ouyang & Norris) comb. nov. et emend., is proposed. New evidence to support a Lopingian age for the palynoflora, considered to be the youngest Permian palynoflora recorded hitherto in South America, is based on a summary of the published information about its composition, together with an assessment of previous records of the diversity of gymnosperm taxa analysed in this contribution. The co-occurrence of several species of taeniate pollen (described in a previously published part of our work) and the gymnosperm taxa documented here, which have not been reported before from South America, differentiates the palynoflora of the upper La Veteada Formation from all others so far described from this continent. The high ratio of pollen versus spores, plus the botanical and palaeoecological inferences of the gymnospermous component of the formation's palynoflora, reflects a parent vegetation adapted to relatively dry conditions. Such a low-humidity environment is consistent with the sedimentological evidence, which suggests that, through the Lopingian, semi-arid to arid climates dominated the southern South American basins.Ana María Zavattieri* (amz@mendoza-conicet.gov.ar) Unidad de Paleopalinología, Departamento de Paleontología IANIGLA, CCT-CONICET-Mendoza, Av.

ISSN 0311-5518The elasmosaurid plesiosaur Kawanectes lafquenianum is recorded from the upper Campanian–Maastrichtian levels of the La Colonia Formation in Argentina for the first time, thus extending the stratigraphical range of this taxon, which was previously recorded only from the geographically proximal Allen Formation. The new fossils are referrable to K. lafquenianum on the basis of the large posterodistal projection on the humerus supporting an articular facet for a proximal supernumerary ossification, the presence of a depression anterior to the main muscle scar on ventral surface of the humeral shaft, and a high humerus/femur length ratio (∼1.2). Novel diagnostic character states for K. lafquenianum include the presence of a high triangular and distally pointed coronoid process on the mandible, a mandibular symphysis that incorporates 2.5 alveolar spaces on each ramus, and a retroarticular process without dorsal or medial inflexion. Relatively low b/a ratio (measure of coronoid–glenoid cavity length/preglenoid length) could suggest a mechanical advantage toward fast jaw closure and weak bite forces. Comparisons with other elamosaurids this imply that Southern Hemisphere weddellonectian taxa, such as K. lafquenianum, Aristonectes parvidens and Kaiwhekea katiki, were possibly adapted for rapid snapping bites.José Patricio O'Gorman [joseogorman@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar], División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Paseo del Bosque s/n., B1900FWA, La Plata, Argentina, CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Argentina), Buenos Aires, Argentina.",

The revised fauna is characterized by diagnostic species, namely Histiodella holodentata, Histiodella triangularis, and Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus.

However, in the Canning Basin, the faunal change signaled by the disappearance of H. holodentata and appearance of E. pseudoplanus reflects shifting of depositional settings from intermediate to outer shelf environments to shallower inner shelf conditions, coinciding with a regional regression event.

Alcheringa 38 ISSN 0311-5518.A revision of the late Palaeozoic South American pectinid Heteropecten multiscalptus (Thomas) and the establishment of Heteropecten paranaensis sp. nov. have important implications for the relationship between faunal realms within South America. Late Palaeozoic bivalve faunas occur in three distinct realms in South America: a Central Gondwanic Realm with endemic taxa showing affinities to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Namibia, a cold Perigondwanic Realm, and a warm Extragondwanic Realm with tethyan-like affinities similar to faunas of the American Midcontinent. In South America, faunas east of the southern Andes belong to the first two realms and previous interpretations of bivalve faunas suggested biocorrelations with those of the Extragondwanic Realm because they shared the taxon Heteropecten multiscalptus (Thomas). A revision of the Peruvian and Brazilian material does not confirm this. Instead, a re-analysis suggests that two species are present, rather than one: Heteropecten multiscalptus in the Cerro Prieto Formation, Amotape Mountains (Peru; Extragondwanic Realm), and Heteropecten paranaensis sp. nov. in the upper part of the Itararé Group, Paraná Basin (Brazil; Central Gondwanic Realm). Thus, the correlation between the late Palaeozoic faunas of the Central Gondwanic and Extragondwanic Realms in South America can no longer be supported. Heteropecten paranaensis sp. nov. lived in a siliciclastic-dominated, cold, epeiric sea of Brazil and Argentina, and is morphologically similar to some Australian species, whereas the Peruvian H. multiscalptus thrived in the warm seas of the Extragondwanic Realm.Jacqueline P.

In the Xiazhen Formation at Zhuzhai, A. waicunensis and A. maxima are restricted to the lower part of the formation, whereas A. yushanensis occurs in the upper part. Agetolites raritabulatus and A. oculiporoides have greater stratigraphic ranges in the lower and upper parts of the formation. The size and shape of Agetolites coralla at Zhuzhai are considered primarily to be intrinsic characteristics of the species but in some cases also seem to be related to lithofacies; large and domical coralla are dominant in calcareous mudstone facies, whereas small coralla with various forms are commonly found in reef or reef-related facies. In the latter facies, spatial competition is indicated by common occurrences of both Agetolites encrusting stromatoporoids and stromatoporoids encrusting Agetolites.Ning Sun [nsun@cugb.edu.cn], School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing 100083, PR China; Robert J.

ISSN 0311-5518.Rocks of the Lower Siwalik Subgroup exposed around Ramnagar town in Jammu, India, have been known for more than 90 years to yield Chinji-equivalent (14.2–11.2 Ma) hominoid fossils. In 1997, the fossil ape Sivapithecus reported near Kalaunta village in the vicinity of Ramnagar was argued to be about 18 Ma old by its discoverers. This had implications for hominoid evolutionary studies, as molecular clock calibrations are commonly based on Sivapithecus first appearance datum (FAD). In a paper published in 2010, the identification of this hominoid tooth was questioned and reassigned to a suid. Recently, based upon the discovery of an indeterminate fossil bovid from the supposedly hominoid-yielding site near Kalaunta, an age estimate between ca 13.9 and 10.8 Ma was provided. As rodent biochronology has proven to be useful in age assignment of upper Cenozoic terrestrial sequences, the age of the fossil-bearing Lower Siwalik Subgroup of Kalaunta is re-assessed based upon newly recovered cricetid taxa. The cricetid rodents from this site comprise Punjabemys downsi and P. mikros. These two species are known to exist in the well-dated Potwar Siwalik Group succession between 14.3 and 12.6 Ma and between 16.3 and 13.0 Ma, respectively. Based on the overlapping temporal ranges of the cricetid taxa and an indeterminate Bovidae (ca 13.9–10.8 Ma) reported previously from this area, an age of 13.9–13.0 Ma is inferred for rocks occurring in the vicinity of Kalaunta. The new finds refute earlier claims of rocks in the area extending back to ca 18 Ma or as young as 10.8 Ma.Varun Parmar [varunparmarvp@gmail.com], Rahul Magotra [rahulmagotra01@gmail.com] and Rigzin Norboo [norboo04@gmail.com], Post Graduate Department of Geology, University of Jammu, Jammu, 180 006, India; Guntupalli Veera Raghavendra Prasad [guntupalli.vrprasad@gmail.com], Department of Geology, Centre for Advanced Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India.",

Reassessment of Neovenericor Rossi de García, Levy & Franchi, 1980 (Bivalvia: Carditidae) using a geometric morphometric approach, and revision of planicostate carditids from Argentina. Alcheringa 41, xxx–xxx. ISSN0311-5518.Various systematic approaches have been applied to the Neogene planicostate carditids of Patagonia. Some authors have included these species within Venericor (known from the Eocene of North America and Europe) or in Megacardita (recorded from the Miocene of Europe). By contrast, Rossi de García et al. erected the endemic Neovenericor in 1980 for Patagonian species. The three proposed genera have variable outlines and similar hinge teeth configuration. Two geometric morphometric analyses were performed, which included the type species of the following taxa: M. jouanneti (middle Miocene, Mediterranean Basin), V. planicosta (middle Eocene, Paris Basin) and N. austroplata (early Miocene, Chenque Formation, Chubut Province). In the first approach, an Elliptic Fourier Analysis was used to test the general variability of outlines. In the second, a landmark-based method was employed to analyse the hinge configuration, followed by a Discriminant Function Analysis. The outline analysis discriminated Megacardita from the other two taxa based on its more elongate and rectangular shells. The Landmark Analysis distinguished the three taxa based on both, left and right hinges. The Discriminant Function Analysis showed significant values for this differentiation. Neovenericor has a higher hinge plate, broader and less posteriorly inclined teeth, and a less sinuous ventral edge than Megacardita; and it has larger and more posteriorly inclined teeth than Venericor. Other morphological characters of the genus include an intermediate number of radial ribs that do not dissipate ventrally, and wide and deep intercostal spaces. Thus, Neovenericor is clearly a distinct taxon. All Argentinian planicostate carditids were revised and included in this genus because they embrace its diagnostic features.Damián E.

Vera is defined based on several permineralized stems recovered from geothermally influenced chert deposits in the Middle–Late Jurassic La Matilde Formation (Santa Cruz, Argentina). Millerocaulis zamunerae sp. nov. is characterized by the presence of an ectophloic dictyoxylic siphonostele, inner parenchymatic and outer sclerotic cortices, homogeneous sclerotic ring in the petiole bases, two masses of sclerenchyma lining the concavity of the petiolar vascular bundle, petiolar inner cortex with sclerenchyma strands in the outermost petiole cycles and stipular wings having one large and several smaller sclerenchyma bundles. Millerocaulis zamunerae inhabited geothermal wetlands and other hot-spring-related sedimentary facies associated with the La Bajada epithermal deposit. Reference to active geothermal wetlands, analogous living plants and other fossil hot spring ecosystems suggest the plant's tolerance of physico-chemical stressors including elevated temperature, pH, salinity and phytotoxic metals/metalloids.

    "abstract": "The Australian Mesozoic fish fauna is considered to be depauperate in comparison with fish faunas in the Northern Hemisphere. However, due to its geographical location as a potential radiation center in the Southern Hemisphere, Australia's Mesozoic fish fauna is important for understanding fish radiations. Most of the modern fish groups originated during the Mesozoic, but the first records of a modern fish fauna (freshwater and marine) in Australia does not occur until the lower Paleogene. Here, we review all known fossil fish-bearing localities from the Mesozoic of Australia, to improve the understanding of the record. The apparent low Australian Mesozoic fish diversity is likely due to its understudied status of the constituent fossils rather than to a depauperate record. In addition, we review recent work with the aim of placing the Australian Mesozoic fish fauna in a global context. We review the taxonomy of Australian fossil fishes and conclude that the assignments of many actinopterygians need major revision within a modern phylogenetic context. The vast majority of chondrichthyans are yet to be formally described; to the contrary all of the known lungfish specimens have been described. This study considers the microscopic and fragmented remains of Mesozoic fish already found in Australia, allowing a more complete view of the diversity of the fishes that once inhabited this continent.Rodney W.

    "abstract": "Five species of marsupial lions (Thylacoleonidae) have been documented from the Oligo-Miocene freshwater limestone deposits of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwestern Queensland, significantly altering understanding of the evolution of this extinct family. This paper presents a further two new thylacoleonid taxa from this fossil-rich region: Lekaneleo myersi sp. nov., from middle Miocene deposits, and Enigmaleo archeri gen. et sp. nov., from early Miocene deposits. Lekaneleo myersi is described from a dentary, partial maxilla and isolated teeth. It is approximately 10% larger in most linear dental dimensions than its sister taxon L. roskellyae. In this feature, it echoes the morphological cline shown by members of the Wakaleo lineage of marsupial lions, which increase their size through the Miocene. Although the first upper molar of L. myersi exhibits a tall metacone, a feature normally characteristic of species of Wakaleo, other features of its upper and lower molars support its attribution to Lekaneleo. Enigmaleo archeri gen. et sp. nov. is described from an isolated upper third premolar. This species is smaller than those of Lekaneleo, but larger than Microleo attenboroughi, the smallest known thylacoleonid. This premolar exhibits an intriguing combination of features, some of which are seen in Microleo and others in Lekaneleo, and on this basis is attributed to a new genus. It is the fourth thylacoleonid taxon from early Miocene deposits, making this time the most diverse period in thylacoleonid evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of 53 dental and 16 cranial characters recovers Enigmaleo as the sister taxon to Microleo, with this clade forming the sister group to the rest of the thylacoleonid family; however, the relationships among species of Lekaneleo was not resolved in this analysis. Comparisons of the morphology of the upper third premolars of all thylacoleonid taxa indicate that the evolution of the Thylacoleo form is more likely to have been derived from a Microleo or Enigmaleo form, and on this basis it is postulated that one of these groups may have provided the ancestor of the Thylacoleo lineage.Anna Gillespie [a.gillespie@unsw.edu.au], Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, School of Biological Earth and Environmental Science.

    "abstract": "The late Oligocene taxa Marada arcanum and Mukupirna nambensis (Diprotodontia, Vombatiformes) are the only known representatives of the families Maradidae and Mukupirnidae, respectively. Mukupirna nambensis was described from a partial skeleton, including a cranium but no dentary, and reconstructed as the sister taxon to Vombatidae (wombats). By contrast, Ma. arcanum is known only from a single dentary, preventing direct comparison between the two. Here, we describe a new species, Mu. fortidentata sp. nov., based on craniodental and postcranial specimens from the Oligocene Pwerte Marnte Marnte Local Fauna, Northern Territory, Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of Vombatiformes, using 124 craniodental and 20 postcranial characters, places these three species within Vombatoidea, wherein Marada arcanum is sister to species of Mukupirna + Vombatidae. Mukupirna fortidentata sp. nov. does not share any robust synapomorphies of the dentary with Ma. arcanum that would support placing them together in a clade to the exclusion of Vombatidae. We therefore maintain separation of the families Mukupirnidae and Maradidae. From a functional perspective, the craniodental specimens of Mu. fortidentata sp. nov. reveal a suite of morphological traits that are unusual among vombatiforms, which we interpret as adaptations for acquiring and processing hard plant material. These include: a short, broad rostrum; large, robust, steeply upturned incisors; and a steep, anteroposteriorly decreasing gradient in cheek tooth size. The dental specimens of Mu. fortidentata sp. nov. also assist in the identification of two further allied taxa: an early vombatid from the younger late Oligocene Tarkarooloo Local Fauna, South Australia; and a possible vombatoid from the earliest Miocene Geilston Bay Local Fauna, Tasmania. The Tarkarooloo Local Fauna taxon indicates that vombatids diverged from other vombatoids prior to 24 million years ago.Arthur I.

The fossil woods resemble members of the Perseae-Cinnamomeae-Laureae clade but do not closely match any extant genus; they therefore probably represent an extinct lineage. Although lauraceous woods are known from other Palaeocene and Eocene floras in Patagonia, the presence of the family at Laguna del Hunco was previously based only on leaf compressions without preserved cuticular details.

    "abstract": "Abstract Comparison of the ultrastructure of the hyaline tissue of conodont elements and the enamel of vertebrates provides little support for a close phylogenetic relationship between conodonts and vertebrates. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy shows that the mineralised component of the hyaline tissue of Panderodus and of Cordylodus elements consists of large, flat, oblong crystals, arranged in layers that run parallel to the long axis of the conodont. Enamel in the dentition of a living vertebrate, the lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, has crystals of calcium hydroxyapatite, arranged in layers, and extending in groups from the dentine-enamel junction; the crystals are slender, elongate spicules perpendicular to the surface of the tooth plate. Similar crystal arrangements to those of lungfish are found in other vertebrates, but none resembles the organisation of the hyaline tissue of conodont elements. The crystals of hydroxyapatite in conodont hyaline tissue are exceptionally large, perpendicular or parallel to the surface of the element, with no trace of prisms, unlike the protoprismatic radial crystallite enamel of fish teeth and scales, or the highly organised prismatic enamel of mammals.

    "abstract": "Abstract Machaeridians are an enigmatic group of multisclerite-bearing benthic marine invertebrates, known from Lower Ordovician to Pennsylvanian rocks. They receive almost no attention, but are very common fossils, especially in faunas of Middle Ordovician to Early Devonian age. Evidence that machaeridians form a monophyletic group includes many shared derived morphological features of their sclerites, and their highly characteristic mode of sclerite formation. Machaeridian sclerites are calcitic, and feature an outer sclerite layer formed by marginal accretion, and an inner layer formed by serial addition of calcite elements in linear series radiating from the sclerite umbo. The class Machaeridia is understood herein to comprise the order Turrilepadomorpha Pilsbry, 1916, including the families Turrilepadidae Clarke 1896 and Plumulitidae Jell 1979, and the order Lepidocoleomorpha Schallreuter 1985, including the family Lepidocoleidae Clarke 1896. The latter family is unique in the possession of a dorsal tongue and groove hinge by which opposing sclerites of a given body segment articulated. All machaeridian species have distinct dextral and sinistral sclerite morphologies. All lepidocoleid species, and isolated members of some other families, are enantiomorphic, with some right-handed and some left-handed individuals. Recent classifications have united machaeridians with other problematic groups, including tommotiids, sachitids, and hercolepadids. Such proposed relationships have very weak evidential bases, and should be rejected. Keywords: MachaeridiaPalaeozoictommotiidssachitidssclerite growthenantiomorphismclassification",

Cladistic analysis of 50 discrete postcranial characters coded for 16 ingroup and two outgroup taxa suggests that R. flanneryi is the most plesiomorphic member of a clade containing the late Miocene macropodid Hadronomas puckridgi and crown-group sthenurines.

The assemblage is best collectively correlated with the Mortoniceras (M.) inflatum Zone of the standard European Albian zonation but some of its members may represent the lower part of the Stoliczkaia dispar Zone. It is broadly correlative with faunas from the Eromanga Basin, which relate to an extensive eastern Australian Late Albian epicontinental sea, but is strikingly different in aspect. The Wangarlu Mudstone assemblage has relatively high diversity and an abundance of cosmopolitan heteromorph taxa well known from Europe and elsewhere, whereas Eromanga Basin assemblages are of relatively low diversity and dominated by Austral heteromorph genera known only from Australasia, southern Africa and Malagasy. The Austral character of Eromanga Basin assemblages is attributed to evolution in a restricted epicontinental sea environment and modest dispersal whereas the continental margin position of the Wangarlu Mudstone ensured an influx of pandemic elements drawn from the mid-Cretaceous world ocean.

The occurrences help to bridge the gap in the record between earliest known, Middle Cambrian, and later, Early Devonian, forms reported recently from other New South Wales localities. The sphinctozoans appear to have had a restricted distribution in their Early Palaeozoic history, mainly confined to island-arc shelf areas of eastern Australia and possibly similar settings of the Palaeo-Pacific rim in western North America. The new genus and species, Belubulaia packhami, is described from silicified material in the lower part of the Belubula Limestone near Little Boonderoo and Licking Hole Creek. A second new genus and species, Angullongia vesica, is much larger, calcareous and from an unnamed thin limestone unit of the Angullong Tuff on the property of Millamolong. Together these new genera constitute the new family Angullongiidae characterized by having large, spoutlike ostia as well as prosopores, and vesicular filling of porous chambers.",

It is concluded that four Fagus species proposed by Ettingshausen represent only one valid species. The name selected for this species is Nothofagus muelleri, based on the fact that it is the only species containing specimens with organic preservation. It is recommended that the fossil species Fagus celastrifolia, F. hookeri and F. benthami be regarded as synonyms of N. muelleri. N. muelleri has strong affinities with the extant species N. moorei and N. cunninghamii and the fossil species N. tasmanica and N. johnstonii. Cinnamomum nuytsii clearly belongs to the family Lauraceae, but the affinity with the genus Cinnamomum cannot be substantiated. Therefore it is proposed that this species be transferred to the organ genus Laurophyllum.

Taphonomic and faunal analyses indicate that the predominant mode of accumulation was via a surface exposed pitfall trap. An avian predator, such as Tyto alba, may have been responsible for the accumulation of small mammal remains. The faunal assemblage is taxonomically diverse containing at least 47 taxa. It includes many browsing species such as Wallabia bicolour and the extinct Sthenurine kangaroos and Zygomaturus trilobus, as well as small mammals that require trees and a thick understorey. The Grant Hall fauna thus indicates the presence of densely vegetated woodland, interspersed with small patches of open and thickly grassed areas in the proximal vicinity of the old cave entrance. The relative abundances and species composition of the Macropodidae fauna in Grant Hall are significantly different from other faunal assemblages found at Naracoorte.

These shared character states and many other structural similarities in the cranial base between Mutpuracinus and Barinya indicate shared ancestry, with the dentally more conservative Dasyuridae representing the plesiomorphic sister group to the Thylacinidae. Other Oligocene-Miocene thylacinid species in which the bony ear region is preserved (Badjcinus turnbulli, Nimbacinus dicksoni) show intermediate states between Mutpuracinus archibaldi and Thylacinus cynocephalus. These indicate that the states of the ear region of Thylacinus cynocephalus (small, posteriorly open alisphenoid tympanic wing, absence of petrosal tympanic process, alisphenoid surrounding primary foramen ovale), which resemble some South American didelphoid marsupials, are not primitive. They are secondarily derived states in which the alisphenoid tympanic wing and contacting processes are reduced.",

    "abstract": "A long term overview is taken of patterns of speciation and extinction among Australian marsupial herbivores. Three generalised periods are considered; the Pliocene, early to early-late Pleistocene and the last 100 ka. Available data indicate no single extinction event occurred, rather, each morphophysiological herbivore guild (foregut and hindgut fermenters, browsers, grazers and mixed-feeders) exhibit very different patterns of speciation and extinction. Extinctions that occurred prior to ~100 ka are attributed to the direct influence of climate, compounded by the complex interaction of the herbivores themselves on vegetation. Eight genera (15 species) of mega-herbivore survived all earlier climatic and environmental stresses, only to become extinct during the last ~55 ka. Late survival of this group is attributed to their large body size. However, ecophysiological attributes associated with large body size would also have increased their vulnerability to human impact, which eventually caused their extinction. Modern large kangaroos, particularly the wallaroos, euros and red kangaroos have superb anatomical, physiological and reproductive adaptations, which evolved or were honed during the middle Pleistocene glacial cycles. These features, and their ability to survive on poor quality grasses, have ensured their status as Australia's surviving ‘megafauna’.",

Although known from only a single dentary, it is assigned to a new family Maradidae, based on a unique combination of both plesiomorphic and apomorphic features. Of the known vombatomorphians, Marada is most similar to primitive wynyardiids and diprotodontoids (palorchestids and diprotodontids). Further clarification of the phylogenetic position of Maradidae within Vombatomorphia requires discovery of upper dentitions and crania.

Middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician faunas from the Chingiz Mountain Range, central Kazakhstan. Alcheringa 32, 443–463. ISSN 0311-5518. The middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician back-arc sedimentary succession studied in the Kol'denen River and in the Zerbkyzyl Mountains of the central Chingiz Mountain Range is composed predominantly of siltstones, sandstones and volcaniclastic rocks with rare beds of micritic carbonates, black shales and cherts. Fossil assemblages including conodonts, lingulate brachiopods, arthropods, sponges and probable Tasmanites cysts were recorded both from the carbonate and chert beds showing that richly diverse marine environments existed directly adjacent to the volcanic arcs. The Kol'denen River localities contain a diverse upper Cambrian paraconodont assemblage of the open-sea affinity. The representatives of Rossodus, Cordylodus, Drepanodus and Variabiloconus, having an almost pandemic distribution and characteristic of basinal facies, dominate the Lower Ordovician conodont fauna. The Cambrian–Ordovician boundary transition is characterized by chert production that was more likely caused by a local productivity increase than by general changes in palaeooceanographic and palaeogeographical conditions.

In Shitai County, Anhui Province, East China, the Zitai Formation is rich in conodonts, enabling the recognition of four biozones based on first appearance data. Detailed palaeontological and biostratigraphical study of these conodonts reveals that the Ordovician conodont radiation in the Lower Yangtze Platform attained its first diversity peak low in the Oepikodus evae Biozone. This diversification is generally consistent with macroevolutionary trends of brachiopods of South China and graptolites of the Upper Yangtze Platform, but was earlier than that of trilobites and acritarchs of the same palaeoplate. Correlation with the sea-level curve for South China suggests that conodont diversity change during the Ordovician radiation was mainly controlled by regional sea-level fluctuations.",

A deep-water brachiopod fauna (20 species in 19 genera) is described from the Late Permian Shaiwa Group of Ziyun, Guizhou, South China. New species include Pygmochonetes? shaiwaensis and Martinia ziyunensis. This fauna is associated with deep-water assemblages of pelagic radiolarians, foraminifers, bivalves and ammonoids. The brachiopod faunal correlations and age constraints of the associated fossil groups suggest that the Shaiwa fauna is late Changhsingian (latest Permian) in age. The Shaiwa fauna superficially resembles the coeval deep-water assemblage from Guangxi, South China; both are characterized by a mixture of deep-water brachiopods and shallow-water elements.",

ISSN 0311–5518.Neoselachian (modern shark) teeth and palynomorphs have been recovered from the Late Cretaceous Jagüel Formation in the Province of Mendoza, Argentina. The fossiliferous beds were deposited during the Atlantic transgression that covered northern Patagonia and other parts of South America from the Maastrichtian to the Danian. Teeth of several lamniform sharks are attributed to the anacoracid Squalicorax pristodontus and cf. Serratolamna serrata of indeterminate familial affinity. These taxa became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous and confirm the late Maastrichtian age previously assigned to the Jagüel Formation in this northwestern part of the Neuquén Basin. For the first time, the selachian faunas are described together with algae and dispersed organic matter assemblages (palynofacies), revealing new elements of the neritic biota leading up to the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) mass extinction in South America. The palynoflora consists exclusively of the prasinophyte algae Tasmanites, Cymatiosphaera and Pterospermella, indicative of stratified saline waters. Dispersed organic components in the profile (mainly opaque equidimensional phytoclasts and prasinophytes) are consistent with an inner neritic environment, with evidence (a great variety of particle sizes, lath-shaped phytoclasts increasing slightly in number and decreasing number of marine components) of slightly more nearshore conditions towards the upper part of the profile. These marine biotas confirm the presence of an epeiric sea over northern Patagonia, which extended westwards to the volcanic arc on the western flank of the Andean Cordillera in Mendoza.Mercedes B.

Humeral morphology of the early Eocene mekosuchine crocodylian Kambara from the Tingamarra Local Fauna southeastern Queensland, Australia. Alcheringa 36, 473–486. ISSN 0311-5518. Mekosuchines (Crocodylia; Crocodyloidea) were a clade of crocodylians endemic to Australia and the South Pacific that underwent radiation during the Cenozoic. Numerous questions about mekosuchine palaeoecology remain unanswered. Tantalizing among these is the possibility that some mekosuchines were primarily terrestrial. To date, studies of mekosuchines have focused mainly on the cranium. However, the morphological signal for terrestriality is more likely to be found in the postcranial skeleton. Here, we present a comparative morphological study of fossil humeri referable to Kambara from the early Eocene Tingamara Local Fauna, Murgon, southeastern Queensland. The humeri of Kambara do not show the torsion between the proximal and distal extremity seen in extant crocodylians, illustrated here with Crocodylus porosus and Crocodylus johnstoni. They also differ in the structure of the medial and lateral condyles of the distal extremity. When the effects of these features on musculature and articulation are considered, it appears that the forelimb of Kambara could have facilitated a greater force at the glenohumeral joint and possibly swung the lower forelimb faster with a greater arc of motion than Australia's extant crocodylians. This is conducive to an improved capacity for both terrestrial locomotion and paraxial swimming. Although the former case suggests that Kambara may not have been as closely tied to water as extant crocodylians, it is unusual given the typically broad rostra of the cranium. Among crocodylians this is a common characteristic of semi-aquatic ambush predators. This study shows the utility of the postcranial skeleton in interpreting crocodylian palaeoecology.

ISSN 0311-5518.Elasmosaurids are one of the most frequently recorded marine reptiles from the Weddellian Province (Patagonia, Western Antarctica and New Zealand). Improvements in our knowledge of elasmosaurid diversity have been problematic because of their conservative postcranial morphology. However, recent studies have helped to improved our understanding of the diversity of this group. Here, a new elasmosaurid specimen from the upper Maatrichtian horizons of the López de Bertodano Formation, Antarctica, MLP 14-I-20-16, is described. MLP 14-I-20-16 is one of the youngest non-aristonectine weddellonectian elasmosaurids from Antarctica. We confirm the coexistence of aristonectine and non-aristonectine elasmosaurids in Antarctica until the end of the Cretaceous. MLP 14-I-20-16 shows distinctive short and broad posterior cervical vertebrae, a feature only shared among the weddellonectian elasmosaurids by the Maastrichtian Morenosaurus stocki, although the same vertebral proportions are also recorded for the giant Cenomanian elasmosaurids Thalassomedon haningtoni. Comparison between MLP 14-I-20-16 and other elasmosaurids from the Maastrichtian of Antarctica indicates that at least two different non-aristonectine elasmosaurids were present in Antarctica during the late Maastrichtian.José P.

All records are analysed and some attributed to the genus previously are reclassified. Dicroidium leaves are clearly affiliated with Umkomasia ‘megasporophylls’ and Pteruchus ‘microsporophylls’. The attachments of Dicroidium leaves to stems and associated wood genera are reviewed. Dicroidium is shown to be restricted to the Triassic of Gondwana, where it is by far the most prominent and diverse genus with 23 accepted species. It is well represented in collections from South America, Antarctica, India, Australia, New Zealand and southern Africa from where the Molteno Formation is the most comprehensively sampled stratigraphic unit, yielding numerous species from 75 assemblages. The problems of defining the limits of Dicroidium and its species are addressed. The records of leaf fragments from the Indian Nidpur Flora, Early Triassic, are questionably referable to Dicroidium, whereas the multiple forking leaves from the Cisuralian of India await description as a new peltasperm genus.

The fauna has affinities with that of the late Sakmarian‒early Artinskian Nura Nura Member directly overlying the Grant Group in other parts of the basin but, as with all lower Cisuralian (and Pennsylvanian) glacial strata in Western Australia, its precise age remains poorly constrained, especially in terms of correlation to international stages. Although the Calytrix fauna lies within the Pseudoreticulatispora confluens Palynozone, the only real constraint on its age (and that of the associated glacially influenced strata) is from Sakmarian (Sterlitamakian) and stratigraphically younger faunas. A brief review of radiometric ages from correlative strata elsewhere in Gondwana shows that those ages need to be updated. The presence of Asselian strata and the position of the Carboniferous‒Permian boundary remain unclear in Western Australia.Arturo César Taboada [ataboada@unpata.edu.ar], CONICET-Laboratorio de Investigaciones en Evolución y Biodiversidad (LIEB), Facultad de Ciencias Naturales, Sede Esquel, Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia 'San Juan Bosco', Edificio de Aulas, Ruta Nacional 259, km. 16,5, Esquel U9200, Chubut, Argentina; Arthur Mory [arthur.mory@dmp.wa.gov.au], Geological Survey of Western Australia, 100 Plain Street, East Perth, WA 6004, School of Earth and Environment, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; Guang R.

Alcheringa 39, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518.The Mississippian colonial rugose corals of eastern Australia are taxonomically reviewed and assigned to formal genera. Their homeomorphy with the Eurasian genera Siphonodendron and Lithostrotion but also Heterostrotion resulted from parallel evolution within the Lithostrotionidae. Fasciculate species are reassigned to Cionodendron, as they share a robust columella, septotheca and two series of tabellae. Based on common characters, three species groups are recognized: the C. columen Group (characterized by the occurrence of parricidal and non-parricidal increase), the C. hallense Group (development of second-order lonsdaleoid dissepiments) and the C. arundineum Group (lacking the previous characters). Fourteen species are recognized, one being new (C. smithi sp. nov.) and two documented for the first time in the area. The oldest species are late Tournaisian in age, but the genus is most diverse in the middle–late Visean. Several morphological lineages are recognized within the three groups. The massive species are classified in the newly erected genus Australastraea that likely evolved from one of the early species of Cionodendron in the early Visean. Eleven species were identified, two being newly described (A. arcifera, sp. nov., A. carinata sp. nov.) and two others documented for the first time. Australastraea is characterized by a septotheca that is commonly discontinuous, conferring a pseudo-cerioid or astreoid habit. Two morphological groups are identified: the A. wilkinsoni Group (small corallites with simple narrow dissepimentarium) and the A. columnare Group (large corallites with complex dissepimentarium). The small fasciculate species previously referred to Lithostrotion williamsi are here reassigned to the new genus Pickettodendron, which differs from Cionodendron by the lack of minor septa and presence of a complete tabularium but is, nevertheless, relatively closely related to that genus. Pickettodendron is represented by three species, one being new (P. nudum sp. nov.), and is restricted to the early (–'middle') Tournaisian. A polyphyletic origin of the Cionodendroninae is considered, with Cionodendron and Australastraea originated in a first species of Amygdalophyllum and Pickettodendron originated in a second one. The biostratigraphic value of the Cionodendroninae is currently limited owing to the poor stratigraphic coverage of appropriate facies but correlations were made possible by the identification of A. columellaris and C. consanguineum in the early Visean of New South Wales and Queensland, and A. columnare and A. sp. in the middle–late Visean of both states. The Cionodendroninae assemblages of eastern Australia are strongly endemic and possibly represent one of the scarce remains of the Panthalassa Province.Julien Denayer [julien.denayer@ulg.ac.be], Evolution and Diversity Dynamics Lab, Geology Department, University of Liège, B18, Allée du Six-Août, Sart Tilman, B-4000 Liège, Belgium; Gregory E.

(including two species Z. crassa Chen et al. and Z. robustus Wang et al.) is an Ediacaran macroscopic genus in the Wenghui biota from black shales of the upper Doushantuo Formation (ca 551–593 Ma) in northeastern Guizhou, South China. Zhongbaodaophyton has an unequally dichotomous thallus and a robust holdfast, resembling phaeophytes in morphology; however, its cytological features are not determinable from the carbonaceous compression fossils. Its thallus bears at least nine photosynthetic branches, and its holdfast consists of a globose tuberous rhizome with many unbranched or dichotomous filamentous rhizoids. In addition, these Ediacaran macroalgal species bear pith in the stipe and tuberous rhizome, which is a key feature of phaeophytes. Based on the measurements of 129 Z. robustus specimens, the degree of branching is closely related to the thallus length, the stipe width, and the width ratio of two primary branches; and the stipe width is correlated with the thallus length, the two primary branch widths, and the first branching angle. The thallus grew primarily upward to enhance its competitiveness for sunlight and/or nutrient uptake in the Ediacaran marine ecosystem. A turning point toward reduced growth rates may have occurred in the life history of Z. robustus individuals (at the fourth or fifth axial bifurcation).Yue Wang [gzyuewang@126.com], School of Resources and Environments, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550003, PR China; Ye Wang [gboywangye@126.com] and Xunlian Wang [wxl@cugb.edu.cn], School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing 100083, PR China; Wei Du [duwei@ea.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp], Department of Earth Science and Astronomy, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan.",

ISSN 0311-5518.Boa constrictor is an extant boid widely distributed through the neotropical region, from the north of Central America to central Argentina. The fossil record of the species includes examples from several localities across the Americas that extend beyond the current distribution of the species. Here we report the first Plio–Pleistocene fossils of Boa from Monagas state, Venezuela. The material comes from El Breal de Orocual (Maturín municipality), which is an inactive tar seep deposit emplaced within the Mesa Formation. The specimens consist of two isolated anterior trunk vertebrae, an articulated sequence of six mid-trunk vertebrae and two posterior trunk vertebrae. The vertebrae are attributed to B. constrictor based on the following features: robust and high vertebrae; thick zygosphene with a notched or concave anterior edge; presence of a paracotylar, subcentral and lateral foramina; marked parasagittal ridges; epizygapophyseal process evident on the dorsal surface of the postzygapophyseal articular facets and high blade-like neural spine. The presence of B. constrictor in northern of Venezuela indicates a palaeoenvironment probably like savanna crossed by rivers with riparian forests, and suggests the predominance of a mesothermal climate with a moderate rainfall.Silvio Y.

[Google Scholar] from the early Middle Permian (Roadian) upper Wandrawandian Siltstone of the southern Sydney Basin, southeastern Australia. The highly meandering trace with closely spaced, papillate chevrons is interpreted to have been produced by the locomotion-feeding behaviour of certain protobranch bivalves in an offshore environment. The dense trails occurring on the upper bedding planes of pebbly siltstone may represent a gregarious lifestyle, where junior and senior individuals of the trace-maker bivalves coexisted while moving within sediments. The Wandrawandian Protovirgularia also represents the first known occurrence of this ichnotaxon from a glaciomarine environment in the Permian eastern Gondwana. The global record of Protovirgularia occurrences suggests that these trails had a wide environmental distribution since the Cambrian, and there is no obvious difference in the environmental distribution of Protovirgularia after the Permian‒Triassic transition.Mao Luo [m.luo@deakin.edu.au] and G.R.

The taxon is based upon an incomplete associated skeleton comprising part of the right mandibular ramus, several teeth, a series of cervical, pectoral, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, as well as ribs, limb girdle elements including a nearly complete right scapula, and various distal limb bones. A unique character state combination serves to distinguish the Amaltheenton Formation remains from other previously documented Early Jurassic plesiosaurians. The most important features are the presence of a longitudinal notch incising the posterior rim of the glenoid fossa and retroarticular process, and a pronounced ventrolateral shelf on the scapula, both of which constitute derived states otherwise shared with Early Cretaceous leptocleidians. However, phylogenetic analysis using a 'total group' Plesiosauria data-set that specifically accommodates for Pliensbachian taxa unanimously placed the Amaltheenton Formation plesiosaurian among Early–Middle Jurassic pliosaurids. This discovery is significant because it reveals unexpected homoplasy, but also because it establishes what is only the third formally named plesiosaurian taxon thus far documented from Pliensbachian strata worldwide.Sven Sachs* [sachs.pal@gmail.com], Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld, Abteilung Geowissenschaften, Adenauerplatz 2, 33602 Bielefeld, Germany and Im Hof 9, 51766 Engelskirchen, Germany; Benjamin P.

    "abstract": "AbstractWe redescribe and interpret the postcranial elements of Allalmeia atalaensis Rusconi, found in the Divisadero Largo Formation, Mendoza, Argentina. Allalmeia is one of the few basal notoungulates with preserved postcranial remains. Rusconi initially documented a skull, several vertebrae and part of the appendicular skeleton but these specimens were subsequently lost. Recently though, distal components of the holotype humeri, the proximal portion of the right femur, several broken diaphyses and most of the left and right pes (MCNAM-PV 507), were relocated. Preparation of this material has revealed new details, especially from the plantar side of the feet. The calcaneum has a distal peroneal process with marked rugosity in the lateral end, a well-developed calcaneal plantar tubercle and a large sustentaculum tali. The naviculars exhibit a well-developed medial tuberosity and slightly contact the calcaneum on the dorsal side, a condition called a ‘reverse alternating tarsus’. The disposition and morphology of the cuneiforms are similar to those of more recent typotheres and the archaic ungulate Tetraclaenodon puercensis. The phalangeal rows are oblique to each other, as in some extant digitigrade mammals. The ungual phalanges are claw-like suggesting that they might have borne claws. Long bones are gracile in comparison with other notoungulates, but with well-developed muscle origins and insertions. The use of body-mass allometric equations and a comparison with extant analogues suggests that Allalmeia was a small, generalized, digitigrade animal. An estimated body mass of approximately 3 kg is consistent with oldfieldthomasiids and archaic ungulates.我们重新描述和解释了Allalmeia atalaensis Rusconi 的颅后骨骼，这些骨骼发现于阿根廷Mendoza的Divisadero Largo组。Allalmeia是为数不多的带有颅后骨骼的基部南方有蹄类之一。 Rusconi最初记录了一个头骨、若干脊椎骨和附肢骨骼的一部分，但这些标本后来丢失了。然而，近来肱骨模式标本的远端骨骼、右股骨的近侧部分、若干破碎的骨干和最左和右的PE（MCNAM-PV 507）被重新找到。这些材料的制备揭示了新的信息，特别是脚的跖侧。跟骨具有远端腓突起（其侧端明显粗糙）、一个发达的跟骨结节跖和大型sustentaculum大里骨。舟状骨表现出发达的中结节，在背侧与跟骨微微相触，这是一种被称为“反向交替跗节'的症状。契形骨的配置和形态类似于较近代的型兽和古老的有蹄类Tetraclaenodon puercensis。指骨行互相倾斜，这和一些现生有趾哺乳动物一样。爪状指骨暗示他们可能具有爪子。长骨与其它南方有蹄类相比呈细长，但具有发达肌肉的起源和插入。使用体重异速生长方程，并与现存类似物的比较,表明Allalmeia是一个小的、广义的有趾动物。据估计，它的体重约三公斤，这与oldfieldthomasiids及古老的有蹄类动物相一致。Key words: NotoungulataEoceneSkeletonMendoza.

ISSN 0311-5518.The hemipteran suborder Coleorrhyncha includes only 37 extant species assigned to the family Peloridiidae. However, the suborder’s fossil record is diverse and abundant. The extinct family Progonocimicidae is very common in Middle Jurassic strata of northeastern China, especially in the Daohugou beds of Ningcheng County, Inner Mongolia, and the Haifanggou Formation in Beipiao, Liaoning Province. We re-studied the established progonocimicid species and examined 27 new specimens, indicating that the species from Daohugou are junior synonyms of those from Haifanggou. The progonocimicids from the Haifanggou Formation are assigned to two species of Cicadocoris: C. brunneus (=Mesoscytina brunnea, =Mesocimex lini) and C. sinensis (=Cicadocoris anisomeridis). Both species are common in the Daohugou beds and the Haifanggou Formation. This discovery is of significance for biostratigraphic correlation of these two lithostratigraphic units.

The dendroid thallophytes have variable forms, possibly owing to heteromorphic variation. Many lateral branches extend from the upper portions of the main axes; the lateral branches bear terminal vegetative vesicles, reproductive vesicles, monosporangium-like discoidal vesicles and urn-shaped pseudoparenchymatous structures. The vegetative vesicles give rise to clavate pseudoparenchymatous structures, characterized by differentiation of the thallus medulla/cortex, which might represent an early stage of thallus development. An oogamous conceptacle arising from one carpogonial vesicle forms a highly specialized goblet-shaped conceptacle. The discovery of the new dendroid multicellular thallophytes provides not only the first fossil-based evidence of the morphological complexity and tissue differentiation in the Precambrian organisms but also insights into the life cycle of the Precambrian red algae.Wei Du* [duwei@ea.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp], School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, PR China; Xun Lian Wang [wxl@cugb.edu.cn], School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, 100083, PR China; Tsuyoshi Komiya [komiya@ea.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp], Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan.

ISSN 0311-5518.Ratitae is represented in South America exclusively by Rheidae. Recently, the oldest purported fossil rheid, Diogenornis fragilis, was attributed by several authors to various other ratite clades. A new revision of museum fossil specimens from Argentina has resulted in the discovery of several ratite specimens that clearly do not belong to Rheidae, but resemble other clades. The newly identified specimens derive from Paleogene and Miocene strata. The great diversity of non-rheid Patagonian ratites ended via extinction of several groups by the late Miocene, probably owing to enhanced aridity that also favoured the dispersal of arid-adapted rheids. The new specimens described here reinforce the hypothesis that the traditional vicariant biogeographical model, which proposes ratite clades originated exclusively before the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent, is questionable owing to the unexpected diversity of various ratite clades in South America, and also in Europe and Africa. This might indicate that the history of Ratitae was more complex than previously envisioned.Federico L.

    "abstract": "The Australian pterosaur assemblage currently consists of specimens recovered only from Cretaceous strata, with most of these referred to the clade Anhangueria. The majority of Australia's pterosaur remains have been discovered in the Eromanga Basin of Queensland, specifically the upper Albian Toolebuc Formation, upper Albian Mackunda Formation, and Cenomanian–lowermost Turonian Winton Formation. In this paper, we describe two new partial pterosaur femora from the Toolebuc and Winton formations. Despite being incomplete, these specimens can be assigned to Anhangueria. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate differences in the deflection of the femoral head. Moreover, a subtle ridge on the posterior surface of the Toolebuc Formation femur is not visible on the specimen from the Winton Formation. The greater trochanter of the Winton Formation femur also preserves a potential bite mark that is tentatively attributed to a crocodylomorph. These new pterosaur fossils supplement the currently limited understanding of pterosaur diversity from Australia, and attest to the cosmopolitan distribution of anhanguerians during the Early to mid-Cretaceous.Adele H.

They significantly influenced global ecosystems during the latest Cretaceous to earliest Palaeogene. The intertrappean sediments, which contain abundant fossil faunal and floral assemblages, offer critical insights into biotic diversity during this interval. Here, we report the discovery of durophagous lizard teeth from the Deccan intertrappean deposits (uppermost Cretaceous/Palaeocene) at Kesavi, in the Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, India. Four isolated durophagous teeth and one bicuspid tooth are attributed to lizards, whereas another isolated tooth might belong to a snake. These remains represent the first documented occurrence of amblyodont-type teeth in the Deccan intertrappean deposits, thus significantly increasing knowledge of squamate diversity during the Cretaceous–Palaeogene transition.",

The specimens of B. rothwellae and D. rutherfordi are preserved as typical moult ensembles. The previously poorly known B. rothwellae is revised on the basis of the specimens from Cumnock, which are better preserved and more numerous than those from the type locality in the Yass–Bowning district. The reassignment of D. rutherfordi to Lochkovella by some authors is rejected, and the original generic assignment supported; owing to the limited material available from Cumnock, the species is revised on the basis of specimens from the type locality near Cheesemans Creek, west of Orange. The mode of moulting in D. rutherfordi changed during ontogeny, from the Ductina mode in small holaspides to the Salterian mode in larger specimens when the posterior branch of the facial suture became fused. Based on other occurrences of B. rothwellae and D. rutherfordi in New South Wales, the Hanover Formation at the Cumnock locality is correlated with the lower part of the Wallace Shale in the Cheesemans Creek district, the lower part of the Elmside Formation in the Yass–Bowning district and the upper part of the Cardinal View Formation in the Bungonia district.",

Spinosaurid remains are especially abundant in the Sao Khua Formation at the Hin Lat Yao locality on Phu Wiang Mountain in Khon Kaen, northeastern Thailand. Following the discovery of Siamosaurus suteethorni—the first named dinosaur from Thailand—several spinosaurid tooth morphologies have been identified, with most resembling either the Siamosaurus or Siamosaurus-type dentition. Here, we study spinosaurid teeth recovered from Hin Lat Yao to clarify their affinities. We also comment on other skeletal remains, including caudal vertebrae found at Hin Lat Yao. We employed both phylogenetic and discriminant analyses to assess the status of S. suteethorni, which shares minute distal denticles and a possibly plesiomorphic reduced crown curvature with Spinosaurinae. The non-serrated carinae are another spinosaurine feature. We, therefore, tentatively classify the Hin Lat Yao spinosaurid as distinct from Siamosaurus, and recognize the Southeast Asian region as having played a potentially significant role in the palaeobiogeography and evolution of Spinosauridae.",

    "abstract": "The upper part of the Red Cliff Coal Measures in northern New South Wales hosts a well-preserved Late Triassic flora that, previously, has not been dated precisely. New high-precision U-Pb zircon dating (U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS) from a bentonite immediately overlying the fossiliferous beds yields a maximum depositional age of 208.66 ± 0.33 Ma. This new chronological constraint demonstrates that at least the upper Red Cliff Coal Measures, and the correlative Blackstone Formation of the Ipswich Basin, are Norian in age rather than Carnian, as suggested previously. Palynological assemblages, although thermally altered and dominated by degraded phytoclasts, include spores and pollen assignable to the Craterisporites rotundus Oppel Zone of de Jersey (Citation1975) and are representative of the high-latitude 'Ipswich microflora' phytoprovince. The macroflora is well preserved in the upper part of the Red Cliff Coal Measures and is dominated by the umkomasialean 'seed fern' Dicroidium odontopteroides but incorporates at least 11 other gymnosperm and two fern taxa typical of the well-documented Late Triassic Dicroidium-dominated floras of southeastern Gondwana. The fossil foliage is typically preserved in dense accumulations reminiscent of modern autumnal leaf mats. These leaves host a moderate array of herbivory and oviposition damage attesting to the presence of a varied insect fauna that is not represented by body fossils. The sedimentary facies associations, ranging from coarse-grained alluvial fan and fluvial channel deposits to finer lacustrine and peat-mire successions, together with numerous scour surfaces and lateral interdigitation of bedforms indicate deposition in a dynamic landscape typical of a small fault-bound continental basin. Collectively, these data refine the stratigraphic framework of the Red Cliff area and correlative components of the Ipswich Basin, and clarify the composition of the Late Triassic palaeovegetation and palaeoenvironments along the eastern margin of Gondwana.",

Its pes was relatively long and robust, resembling those of the sthenurines Procoptodon and Sthenurus in possessing ligamentous specialisations of the fourth proximal phalanx, anteroposterior compression of fourth proximal and median phalanges, broad, blunt 'hoof-like' terminal fourth phalanx, a shallow calcaneocuboidal 'step', anteroposterior as opposed to mediolateral differentiation of the ankle joint, high, rounded profile of the astragalar trochleae and a reduced, medially situated proximal ventromedial facet of the cuboid. The upper and lower limb girdles resemble those of sthenurines in that the coracovertebral angle of the scapula is elevated and produced anteriorly in the form of a rectangular process. The innominate is anteroposteriorly broad and the ischium is flattened in cross section. The tibia possesses a sinuous shaft and an elongated, smoothly convex tibial crest that tapers gradually into the diaphysis. Hadronomas's postcranial skeleton differs from other sthenurines in retaining a large functional fifth digit and in showing no proximodistal compression of the cuboid. A character analysis of the postcranial skeleton of Hadronomas indicates that the genus represents a primitive member of the Sthenurinae, and that the Sthenurinae and the Macropodinae diverged at an early stage in macropodid evolution.",

Representatives of this group are restricted to the Allaru Formation and almost all specimens are Goodhallites goodhalli, a well-known species from the English Gault. The Allaru Formation overlies the Toolebuc Formation, widely considered to be an essentially isochronous unit because of its unusual sedimentary and geochemical character. Using G. goodhalli, the middle and upper Allaru Formation can be directly correlated with the early late Albian orbignyi and auritus Subzones of the Mortoniceras inflatum Zone as recognized in the reference ammonite zonation embedded in the standard Cretaceous time scale. Overlapping ranges of G. goodhalli and Labeceras and Myloceras allow these common Austral heteromorph genera to be also confidently assigned a late Albian age in Australia, matching their biostratigraphic occurrence in South Africa.

The Australian fauna is distinctly different: it resembles other faunas in terms of the presence or absence of taxa, but it differs greatly in the relative abundances of those taxa. Most significant of those differences is the abundance of labyrinthodont amphibians and the commensurate rarity of reptiles. The unusual composition of the Australian fauna might be explained to a large extent by geographic isolation.",

Galahetes shows morphological and size characteristics which indicate that precocious maturation, that is progenesis, was the process responsible for its paedomorphic evolution during the Templetonian Stage. The morphological characteristics of adult Galahetes parallel those found in juvenile stages of Xystridura templetonensis, whose morphology is essentially that of the conservative, structurally ancestral xystridurine stem form which persisted through the Ordian and Templetonian Stages. Both X. altera and X. dunstani are also considered to have evolved from this stem form by paedomorphosis during the Templetonian Stage. In these species, however, the process is thought to have been neoteny, whereby retardation of somatic development resulted in retention of characters which occurred in juveniles of their progenitors. Retardation in onset of maturity, which often accompanies neoteny, allowed the attainment of a larger size.",

Plio-Pleistocene cave fossil sites are numerous and are well known worldwide. The sheltered depositional environment in caves has facilitated the preservation of geochemical information such as stable isotope ratios and DNA in the bone assemblages. Bat colonies and owl roosts, common around cave entrances, contribute to the bone accumulation and provide a good sample of the local smaller vertebrate fauna. The use of caves by mammals as shelters, hibernation sites or dens for young, with the inevitable death in situ of some individuals, provides a unique sample so that growth series and predator-prey relationships can be studied. Caves in upland areas, where other environments of deposition are lacking, preserve a record of animals from those areas that are undergoing erosion. Age determination of cave deposits poses problems because they are isolated from marine or more widespread continental sequences. Correlation must be based on biological similarities, radiometric dates or palaeomagnetic data. Within-cave correlations are often difficult to define because of collapse, channeling and re-deposition. Access to the surface, with multiple openings at different times, may add further complications. Key words: cave vertebrate fossilscave taphonomy",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of fossil vertebrate remains at Black Creek Swamp at the western end of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, along with reports of 'primitive' stone implements in the vicinity has, for more than seventy years, fuelled speculation that this site would reveal a definitive relationship between humans and megafauna. Radiocarbon dating in the 1970s and again in 2004 suggested accumulation at around the last glacial maximum, making it potentially the youngest megafaunal deposit in Australia. Our excavations produced no artefacts and no evidence of butchering. Taphonomic evidence indicates three phases of drought accumulation around an ephemeral water source. These droughts may have been induced by climate, sinkhole drainage, or both. The fauna includes 29 species; one third of the species are extinct. This component is represented by browsing herbivores and their putative predator, Thylacoleo carnifex. The extant species indicate a mosaic of habitats including open sclerophyll forest, grassy patches, areas of shrubby understorey and semi-permanent water sources. The occurrence of two dwarfed species is suggestive of isolation and resource depletion. Multiple dating techniques (OSL, ESR, U-series and C) revealed a complex geochemical history for this site.

Psychroptilus is referred to the Megasecoptera because it lacks paratergal processes on the pronotum, and because its wing venation is simple, with reduced cross veins. However, its wings are not narrowed at their bases, but are as broad as those of the Palaeodictyoptera. It is placed in a new suborder of the Megasecoptera, the Neosecoptera. This suborder differs from the Suborders Eumegasecoptera and Protohymenoptera in having: 1, broad wings that are not narrowed at base; 2, the hind wing slightly broader than the fore wing; and 3, anal veins that all arise from close to the wing base. The insect is possibly the oldest recorded in the southern hemisphere although age determinations of this and the only other known probable Late Carboniferous species, Hadentomoides dwykensis Riek, are not precise. The inclusion of the insect fossil in varve-like sediments and the very few associated fossil species, are indicative of a very cold habitat either at or adjacent to the area producing the sediments. The great majority of insect fossils are associated with abundant plant remains or other fossils indicative of warm conditions in the area of sedimentation. None is recorded from an area apparently as cold as that under which Psychroptilus burrettae was preserved.",

Until now, first appearance data (FAD) of both of these taxa have been considered candidates for such a base, the former allowing reliable correlations within all Cambrian faunal realms, the latter mainly within the Redlichiid and Olenellid realms. However, a recent restudy of the Chinese variants of O. indicus has highlighted a significant link with a similar form, previously assigned as a variant of Oryctocephalus reticulatus (Lermontova, 1940) in the paradoxidid Siberian Kounamkites Zone. This indicates that the Kaili Formation of South China is currently the prime succession for defining the base of Cambrian Series 3, because the FAD of O. granulata and the FAD of O. indicus have been identified in well exposed and studied sections. If the former is the preferred choice, it would correspond closely to the traditional Lower-Middle Cambrian Boundary of Cambria (Wales), whereas the latter would virtually correspond to the Lower-Middle Cambrian Boundary as recognised in Laurentia and Eastern Gondwana-Australasia.",

    "abstract": "Poorly preserved scleractinian corals and cephalopod molluscs occur in metamorphosed and foliated limestones in the Himalayas of northwest India. The nautiloid Cenoceras and macrocephalitid ammonites indicate a Middle Jurassic age. The fossils occur within a zone of high grade metamorphic rocks known as the Central Gneiss, previously regarded as an axial massif of Precambrian basement. Most palaeogeographic reconstructions feature this zone as a prominent topographic arch or 'Himalayan Ridge' which arose in the late Precambrian or early Palaeozoic and, through periodic rejuvenation, persisted throughout the Phanerozoic. Many workers believe that the 'Himalayan Ridge' constituted an effective barrier to north-south faunal migration because the terrains of sedimentary rock which flank the Central Gneiss contain quite different faunas. The Jurassic fossils provide new stratigraphic evidence that the tectonic events which generated the Central Gneiss are relatively young, and this, together with structural considerations, precludes the emergence of a 'Himalayan Ridge' prior to this time. Other evidence shows that the Central Gneiss was generated in the Tertiary, and suggests that the faunal contrast between the Lesser and Tethyan Himalayas reflects a tectonic juxtaposition of dissimilar sedimentary terrains that were previously separated by many hundreds of kilometres.",

    "abstract": "A specimen of the trilobite Olenoides from the middle Cambrian Kaili Biota was found to contain extensive dark stains. Spectral analyses show that the stains contain the elements C, P, S, Ca and Fe. These are elements that commonly form minerals associated with microbial decay of organic matter. The dark stains are interpreted to be remnants of the alimentary tract. Distinctive organs include a stomach region in the cephalon and a post-stomach alimentary canal extending through the thoracic axis to the pygidial terminus. This fossil demonstrates that trilobite gut traces could survive exoskeletal dissolution processes in fine-grained siliciclastic settings. Organic preservation of nonbiomineralised organs of trilobites may be more common in similar settings. Based on the information on body size, appendage morphology, and gut contents inferred from the Kaili and Burgess Shale specimens, Olenoides was a heterotroph that could feed on either entirely soft-bodied invertebrates or organic remains, or both, depending on the availability of food sources.",

The order Arandaspidiformes, also known from the Upper Ordovician of South America (Sacabambaspis), defines a 'Gondwana Endemic Assemblage', which may have been established already by the late Cambrian. Although the first phase of vertebrate biomineralization is not yet documented from the Cambro-Ordovician of Asia, the oldest vertebrates in the early Cambrian Chengjiang fauna and diverse agnathans and gnathostomes by Early Silurian time in South China implicate this as a significant area in the evolution of the earliest vertebrates.",

Among the Pleistocene Cingulata (Glyptodontidae), Neuryurus Ameghino is poorly documented; the only well-characterized species being N. rudis (Gervais), limited to the Ensenadan Age/Stage (early-middle Pleistocene) of the Pampean region in Argentina. The genus is characterized by dorsal carapace osteoderms with uniformly punctate exposed surfaces giving them a rugose, almost spongy aspect; sutures between the osteoderms are loose. Outside Argentina, Neuryurus has been recorded in western Uruguay and southern Brazil. Until now, its temporal range was restricted to the Ensenadan-Lujanian (early Pleistocene–early Holocene). In this context, we present the earliest record of the genus from the San Andrés Formation (Sanandresian Substage; late Pliocene), consisting of dorsal carapace osteoderms and caudal rings and sheath. Most of the associated fauna indicates a dry climate and the assemblage probably characterizes a cold arid event detected at around 2.5 Ma.",

Dipnoans (lungfish) were first described from the Lower Devonian at Taemas N.S.W. in 1906 with the discovery of a species now known as Dipnorhynchus suessmilchi (Etheridge). Subsequent descriptions were based on material from Wee Jasper in N.S.W., Buchan in Victoria and from the Snowy Mountains region of N.S.W. A new genus, Speonesydrion Campbell & Barwick, 1984, has since been described from Wee Jasper and Taemas. No other genera have been described from southeastern Australia (the Molong-Monaro Terrane of Yolkin et al. 2000). A new genus Cathlorhynchus is described from the Currajong Limestone Member. Near the top of the sequence, a large genus described as Dipnorhynchus cathlesae by Campbell & Barwick (1999), has now been placed in a new subgenus Dipnorhynchus (Placorhynchus). Examination of overseas occurrences indicates that there was no immigration of other dipnoans into southeastern Australia in the Early Devonian, hence, we consider that the collective Dipnorhynchus–Speonesydrion lineages must have evolved locally. This evolutionary pattern provides an opportunity to discuss localized evolution within a distinctive group through the Emsian.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A comprehensive understanding of morphological and morphometrical variation for systematically important characters is a prerequisite for reliable taxonomic analyses of extinct morphospecies. However, perception of such variation is commonly limited due to a paucity of fossil material that forms the basis of such analyses. Here we report a new record of Pleistocene Diprotodon optatum Owen, 1838 (Diprotodontoidea) represented by near-complete upper tooth rows that exhibit a high degree of individual variation within systematically important upper premolars. The individual possesses features (e.g. development of parastyle, anterocristae and anterior longitudinal groove) that are considered to be close to the polar extremes of premolar variation within the morphospecies, but occurring on either side of the palate. Although such morphologies were previously recognized on the basis of isolated specimens, they have never been observed as having occurred on either side of the tooth row within a single indvidual. The observation of such extreme variation in premolar form within a single individual means that although the diprotodontoid P3 may serve some systematic importance in distinguishing certain taxa, the weight placed upon perceived differences within any single character of the premolar must be gauged by an understanding of broader variation within the group.

An established diatom-based salinity transfer function is used in combination with autecological methods to reveal a maximum sea level between ca 7000 and 6000 14C years BP. This marine influence was recorded in deposits exposed 2 km and 12 km upstream, but not 32 km from the mouth. The fossil diatom assemblages are characteristic of an estuarine lagoon with maximum inferred salinities of 15‰. When the Holocene transgression began to flood the former valley (ca 7000 14C years BP), brackish lagoons evolved into estuarine settings in the lower valley, but shallow freshwater ponds with salinities <4‰ persisted at 32 km from the mouth.",

One of the methods uses mainly the skull and only some simple measurements of the mandible; the other uses several measurements within the dentary. The results show that bite forces are very high in comparison to predators of the order Carnivora, a feature manifest by several other living and extinct marsupial predators. Differences in size, bite mechanics and special adaptations among the borhyaenoids suggest a very wide range of predatory behaviours that rival those represented in the extant families of the Order Carnivora.",

A new genus and species assigned to the extinct family Palaeontinidae, Synapocossus sciacchitanoae Wang, Shih & Ren, is described from the Middle Jurassic of Daohugou in Inner Mongolia, China. This new genus is established based on well-preserved fossil specimens with body and complete forewings and hind wings. It differs from other described genera by the following characters: small body size, RP and M1 coalescing for an interval on the forewings and M3 + 4 without bifurcation on the hind wings. The RP coalescence with M1 in Synapocossus Wang, Shih & Ren previously reported only in Turgaiella Becker-Migdisova & Wootton, seems to be associated with strengthening of the anterior wing margin. The intra-specific and individual variations of Synapocossus and numerous other insect fossils of northeastern China probably indicate long-lasting ecological stresses and a competitive environment in the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous ecosystems.",

A quantitative study of the Ordovician cephalopod species Sinoceras chinense (Foord) and its palaeobiogeographic Implications. Alcheringa 0, 000–000. ISSN 0311-5518.Sinoceras chinense (Foord) is one of the most important and dominant cephalopods in lower Upper Ordovician deposits of China and has been used traditionally as an index species for the lower Katian of South China. Eight published subspecies, including some morphologically diverse forms, have been assigned to the species, and a taxonomic revision of Sinoceras chinense is required. Based on an examination of the 33 published specimens and 12 new specimens, the relationships of Sinoceras chinense and its allies are analysed using cluster analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling. The results segregate these specimens into three discrete groups: (1) the Sinoceras chinense (Foord) Group; (2) the Sinoceras eccentrica (Yü) Group; and (3) non-Sinoceras chinense Group. Accordingly, we emend the diagnosis of Sinoceras chinense and exclude the specimens of the non-Sinoceras chinense Group. Based largely on this taxonomic redefinition and previously published occurrences of Sinoceras chinense, the palaeobiogeographical distribution of Sinoceras is reconstructed in the South China, North China, Tarim and Tibet. Based on the occurrences, ranges and phylogeny of this genus and its included species, we conclude that Sinoceras originated in South China in late Darriwilian, subsequently dispersed into neighbouring blocks in the Sandbian to the early Katian, and became entirely extinct abruptly in the early late Katian.Xiang Fang* [xfang@nigpas.ac.cn], Yunbai Zhang [ybzhang@nigpas.ac.cn], Tingen Chen [chenten40@126.com], Yuandong Zhang† [ydzhang@nigpas.ac.cn], Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, PR China. *Also affiliated with: University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, PR China. †Also affiliated with: Key Laboratory of Economic Stratigraphy and Palaeogeography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, PR China.

Alcheringa 42, 543-559. ISSN 0311-5518.Isolated teeth and a humerus from the Campanian of Hannover indicate a considerable local diversity of mosasaur taxa. The lower Misburg Formation (lower Campanian of the Lehrte West Syncline) yields Clidastes sp. (Mosasaurinae), Prognathodon sp. (Mosasaurinae), ?Hainosaurus sp. (Tylosaurinae) and an unidentified mosasaurid. It further confirms the presence of the genus Clidastes in northern central Europe and also proves the early Transatlantic distribution of a basal member of Prognathodon during the lower Campanian. ?Hainosaurus sp. is similar to roughly contemporaneous material of Hainosaurus sp. from southern Sweden. The upper Misburg Formation (upper upper Campanian) shows a different taxonomic composition with Tylosaurus sp. (Tylosaurinae), a second indeterminate species of Prognathodon and ?Platecarpus sp. The limited material of Prognathodon sp. shows closest affinities to P. lutugini (Yakovlev) from eastern Europe. The records of Tylosaurus and ?Platecarpus are among the stratigraphically youngest of these taxa. Facies and lithology of the Misburg Formation indicate that the mosasaurs lived in an open marine, mid-sublittoral environment with a water-depth around 70–100 m.

ISSN 0311-5518The microsporophyll genus Pteruchus, belonging to the pteridosperms (seed ferns) in the family Umkomasiaceae (Corystospermaceae), is reassessed comprehensively worldwide and emended. All records are analysed, and some fertile structures previously attributed are reclassified. The Lower Jurassic record of Pteruchus from Germany is ascribed to a new genus as Muelkirchium septentrionalis. Pteruchus is shown to be restricted to the Triassic of Gondwana and is clearly affiliated with the megasporophyll genus Umkomasia and the vegetative leaf genus Dicroidium. It is well represented from Argentina, Antarctica, Australia and southern Africa; the Molteno Formation of southern Africa is by far the most comprehensively sampled, yielding three species and 425 specimens from 22 localities.

    "abstract": "Over the last two centuries, numerous exquisitely preserved thalattosuchian crocodylomorph skeletons have been found in the Jurassic strata of Southern Germany. While the majority of these specimens occur in Toarcian and upper Kimmeridgian–lower Tithonian deposits, thalattosuchian remains are otherwise rare in strata representing different stages of the Jurassic. Here, we describe skeletal elements from two large-bodied thalattosuchians attributable to the family Metriorhynchidae – these were recovered from lower Kimmeridgian sediments in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, respectively. These new metriorhynchid fossils are closely comparable in both stratigraphic age and dental morphology, and thus may be congeneric. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis suggests affinity with metriorhynchid remains from France, Switzerland, and the UK. We interpret these taxa as members of an as-yet unnamed geosaurine metriorhynchid lineage (herein termed the ‘E-clade’) from the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian of Europe, which appears to be related to species of Torvoneustes from England and Mexico, and Purranisaurus potens from Argentina, collectively contributing to ‘Subclade T’ of the tribe Geosaurini. Finally, the metriorhynchid material described herein suggests preservation as a ‘bloat and float’ carcass that underwent diagenetic dispersal within a limestone-marl-alternation deposited in an off-shore epicontinental marine environment.Pascal Abel [pascal.abel@senckenberg.de], Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment, Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen, Sigwartstraße 10, 72076 Tübingen, Germany; Sven Sachs [sachs.pal@gmail.com], Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld, Abteilung Geowissenschaften, Adenauerplatz 2, 33602 Bielefeld, Germany; Mark T.

Here, we describe the third fossil record, an Amblyopone-like specimen from the early Miocene of Otago, southern New Zealand, based on a winged male that resembles the extant A. australis Erichson in size, general habitus and characters of wing venation, but also shares features with the African amblyoponine genus Zymmer.

    "abstract": "Hippoporidra is a cheilostome bryozoan that predominantly encrusts gastropod shells inhabited by hermit crabs. The genus has a Pan-Atlantic distribution and its fossil record ranges from the Eocene to Holocene. Cellepora patagonica Pallaroni is here transferred to Hippoporidra and its autozooids and avicularia are described for the first time based on scanning electron microscopy. Hippoporidra patagonica can be distinguished from the remaining species of the genus by the peculiar shape of its interzooidal avicularia and the morphology of its orifice, which is semicircular, with a straight proximal border. In addition, many specimens have adventitious avicularia located on a suboral umbo. The record of Hippoporidra patagonica (Pallaroni) in the Gran Bajo Member of the San Julián Formation (late Oligocene) in Patagonia confirms the presence of this genus at the southern tip of South America and indicates a Pan-Atlantic distribution during the Cenozoic.",

    "abstract": "Ordovician graptolite-bearing strata in eastern Yunnan were deposited in nearshore, shallow-water environments. Graptolites are systematically described from three sections through the Hungshihyen Formation in eastern Yunnan Province, China: (1) Hongshiya section near Ercun village, Kunming; (2) Liujiang section, Luquan; and (3) Guihuaqing Reservoir section, Luquan. The graptolite fauna, characterized by the predominance of deflexed forms, includes ten species in two genera: Baltograptus turgidus (Lee), B. varicosus (Wang), B. yunnanensis (Li), B. calidus (Ni), B. enshiensis (Ni), Baltograptus sp. cf. B. deflexus (Elles & Wood), Baltograptus sp. cf. B. bolivianus (Finney & Branisa), Baltograptus sp. A, Baltograptus sp. B and Corymbograptus v-fractus minor (Li). A detailed morphological study of these southern Chinese graptolite faunas suggests that Baltograptus wudingensis (Li) is a junior synonym of B. turgidus (Lee); Baltograptus kunmingensis (Ni) is a junior synonym of B. varicosus (Wang); and Baltograptus triangulatus (Ni) is a junior synonym of B. yunnanensis (Li). The B. varicosus Biozone is newly recognized within the middle part of the Hungshihyen Formation, replacing the former Didymograptus deflexus Biozone. This interval is well correlated to the Baltograptus jacksoni Biozone in Britain, the Tetragraptus akzharensis, 'Baltograptus cf. deflexus' and Didymograptus bifidus (lower part) biozones in NW Argentina (eastern Cordillera), and the Acrograptus filiformis and Didymograptellus eobifidus biozones in northern Guizhou, South China. Accordingly, the interval is of mid-Floian age, rather than late Floian as previously proposed.",

The stems show considerable morphological and preservational variation that has historically resulted in the fossils having been assigned to many fossil-species and -genera. However, there is now clear evidence that this simply reflects variation within a single fossil-species, reflecting biological variation and the effects of variable taphonomy, for which the correct taxonomic name is Spondylodendron pranabii (Pal) comb. nov. Part of this morphological variation might have been due to variations in growth rate during the life of the individual plants, which in turn might reflect stressed growing conditions in a wetland habitat. The systematic position of Spondylodendron remains uncertain, owing to the lack of unequivocal evidence of reproductive structures, but it might have affinities with the Sublepidodendraceae.Christopher J.

North American–Asian aquatic bird dispersal in the Miocene: evidence from a new species of diving duck (Anseriformes: Anatidae) from North America (Nevada) with affinities to Mongolian taxa. Alcheringa 41, XXX–XXX. ISSN 0311-5518.Prehistoric intercontinental dispersals are often used to explain the modern geographic distributions of various organisms, including birds. The extant Holarctic avifauna formed largely in the Neogene, and thus dispersals of various taxa during the Miocene likely have had a strong long-lasting effect upon the geographical pattern of the extant avian communities. However, the uneven fossil record of Neogene birds prevents accurate reconstruction of the biogeographic history of many bird clades, and the present evidence on dispersal of birds in the Neogene among continents is very limited. Past dispersals are most likely to be documented by taxa that are well represented in the fossil record, including diving ducks. Although these birds have a rather substantial fossil record in Europe and Asia, they remain very poorly known from the Neogene of North America. Here we document a new species of Miocene diving duck represented by a proximal humerus and a distal tibiotarsus from the Esmeralda Formation in Nevada (USA) and describe it as a new species of the primitive diving duck genus Protomelanitta Zelenkov (Protomelanitta bakeri sp. nov.), previously known only from the middle Miocene of Mongolia. Both species (from Mongolia and Nevada) are from the ca 11–12 Ma age range during the warm (though cooling) middle Miocene after the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum and Middle Miocene Climate Transition. Given their proposed close relationship, it appears that Protomelanitta dispersed between Asia and North America, and this instance is the first clear indication of an aquatic bird dispersal between North America and Eurasia in the middle Miocene. This palaeobiogeographical event predates the famous immigration of Hipparion horses to the Old World and the late Miocene dispersals between continental Eurasian and North American faunas in general, but likely reflects one prolonged faunal interchange related to global climatic conditions and its effects.Thomas A.

Alcheringa 41, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518.The Angullong Formation is the youngest Ordovician unit exposed in the Cliefden Caves area of central New South Wales. Its maximum age is constrained by a Styracograptus uncinatus graptolite Biozone fauna at the very top of the underlying Malongulli Formation, but the few fossils previously reported from higher in the Angullong Formation are either long-ranging or poorly known. From allochthonous limestone clasts in the middle part of the formation, we document a conodont fauna comprising Aphelognathus grandis, A. solidum, Aphelognathus sp., Aphelognathus? sp., Belodina confluens, Drepanoistodus suberectus, Panderodus gracilis, Panderodus sp., Phragmodus undatus, Pseudobelodina inclinata and Pseudobelodina? sp. aff. P. obtusa, which supports correlation with the Aphelognathus grandis Biozone (late Katian) of the North American Midcontinent succession. The species concepts of Aphelognathus and Pseudobelodina are reviewed in detail. Associated corals are exclusively tabulates, dominated by agetolitids, including Agetolites angullongensis sp. nov., Heliolites orientalis, Hemiagetolites breviseptatus, Hemiagetolites sp. cf. H. spinimarginatus, Navoites sp. cf. N. circumflexa, Plasmoporella bacilliforma, P. marginata, Quepora sp. cf. Q. calamus and Sarcinula sp. Affinities of the coral fauna from the Angullong Formation are closer to faunas from northern NSW and northern Queensland than to the locally recognized Fauna III of late Eastonian age in central NSW. We propose a subdivision of Fauna III to account for this difference, with the late Katian Fauna IIIB characterized by the incoming of agetolitid corals. The currently known distribution of representatives of this group with adequate age constraints suggests that agetolitids possibly originated in North China, subsequently migrating to Tarim, South China and adjacent peri-Gondwanan terranes while also spreading eastward to northern Gondwana, where they progressively moved through eastern Australia to reach the central NSW region by the early Bolindian.Yong Yi Zhen* (yong-yi.zhen@industry.nsw.gov.au) and Ian G.

They are included in the Halstätt-like Lilu Facies of the Bandeira Group. Age-diagnostic involutinid foraminiferal species, not previously recorded from Timor, include Involutina liassica, Trocholina sp. ex. gr. Trocholina turris and Lamelliconus permodiscoides, which collectively indicate a Rhaetian age, possibly ranging down to the Sevatian. The conodont Norigondolella steinbergensis, recorded low in the section, is consistent with this age determination. The Lilu Facies was deposited at a water depth of a few tens of metres, as suggested by the presence of extensive cyanobacterial borings into shell fragments and the presence of microbial laminations including the presence of stromatolites and bacinellid-like fabrics. Among macrofossils, common ammonoids are present in the section, and marine reptile bones are conspicuous in the lower beds. Other biogenic components of the rock observed in acetate peels and thin sections are abundant echinoderm debris (including pentacrinoid columnal plates), bivalve fragments and micro-gastropods, rare siliceous sponge spicules, solitary corals, and brachiopod debris. In the studied region, a major drowning of a shallow-marine carbonate platform took place probably in the Rhaetian or possibly latest Norian. Similar 'ammonitico rosso limestone' interbedded with thick-bedded limestones of a shallow-marine carbonate platform is present in the uppermost Triassic of Seram. More detailed biostratigraphical comparisons and correlations of similar units in Timor and other nearby islands may indicate a general marine drowning of Late Triassic carbonate platforms, at least in the northern part of the East Gondwana Interior Rift system, during the Rhaetian or possibly latest Norian.",

We describe four labechiid stromatoporoid species, Labechia variabilis Yabe & Sugiyama, 1930, Labechiella mingshankouensis (Ozaki, 1938), Thamnobeatricea suxianensis (Dong, 1982), and Sinodictyon columnare Yabe & Sugiyama, 1930 from the Middle Ordovician Machiakou Formation in the Xiaonanhai section near Anyang City in northern Henan Province of China. The conodont Plectodina onychodonta occurs in association with these labechiids, implying a middle to late Darriwilian age. This assemblage extends the stratigraphic range of early stromatoporoids in North China to as early as the middle Darriwilian, thus slightly older than the previously known late Darriwilian earliest records. Mutual encrustations of Labechia variabilis and Labechiella mingshankouensis in the present assemblage constructed a microbioherm, together with unidentified tubular organisms, Ortonella-like calcimicrobes, a tubeworm-like organism, and borings. The assemblages of the Darriwilian labechiid stromatoporoids vary from place to place palaeogeographically in the shallow epicontinental marine environment of North China, i.e., in a patchy manner. The significant diversification of Darriwilian labechiid stromatoporoids in North China was likely promoted by a combination of environmental and ecological factors, which include: (1) the occurrence of a very shallow epicontinental marine environment, (2) a possible increase in the carbonate saturation state in seawater, (3) favourable seawater temperature for stromatoporoids during the Middle Ordovician and (4) the scarcity of bryozoans and corals as ecological competitors in North China.",

Two species of fossil dorcopsin have been described from Australia to date one from the lower Pliocene of southeastern Australia; and another from the upper Miocene Alcoota beds of the Waite Formation in the continental interior. Here we describe a third Australian species from the Ongeva deposit, which stratigraphically overlies the Alcoota beds. Dorcopsoides cowpatensis sp. nov. is smaller than its congeners, Dorcopsoides fossilis and Dorcopsoides buloloensis, and differs in a combination of dental and postcranial character states. While its molars are very similar to other dorcopsins, the short, straight premolar resembles that of more derived macropodines. Its hindlimbs appear to have been 'lower geared' than those of D. fossilis, and in overall functional morphology it is similar to species of Dorcopsis and to the Quokka, Setonix brachyurus. We infer that D. cowpatensis was adapted to a relatively closed habitat while still being capable of a powerful bipedal hop.",

Despite their numerical abundance, particularly from the Barremian–Cenomanian of New South Wales and Victoria, articulated remains are extremely rare. Here, we describe the first articulated remains of a small-bodied ornithopod, consisting of a partial hindlimb, from the Cenomanian Griman Creek Formation, which crops out in central-northern New South Wales. The hindlimb includes a number of unusual features not found in other small ornithopods, including a sharp supracondylar crest on the medial surface of the femur and a notched proximal margin of the ascending process of the astragalus. Although this combination of features appears to be unique, most known Australian taxa, including those from the Griman Creek Formation, are known only from isolated craniodental remains, making comparisons impossible. A phylogenetic analysis recovers the new specimen as an elasmarian with possible close affinities to the South American species Isasicursor santacrucensis. As the most complete small-bodied ornithopod yet recovered from the Griman Creek Formation, the new specimen reinforces the elasmarian affinities of at least some Australian ornithopods but also highlights the ongoing difficulties in attempting to resolve their diversity and relationships based on a highly incomplete fossil record.",

The calcareous nannofossils place the strata within the temperate-latitude CC8a Subzone and the Southern Ocean Sollasites falklandensis Subzone; the planktonic foraminifera indicate that the beds belong to the Hedbergella planispira Zone of the Australian region. The biozones suggest an early Albian age (later than the earliest Albian). Abundant calcareous and siliceous plankton and the Marssonella Association of benthonic foraminifera indicate normal-marine depositional conditions in a water depth of about 100 m. The transition from Windalia Radiolarite to Gearle Siltstone may reflect a marine transgressive pulse that reactivated bottom-water circulation and facilitated a significant increase in the calcareous biogenic component of the sediment. Deposition of the basal Gearle Siltstone was coincident with a major increase in bathymetry in the Papuan, Laura, Carpentaria, Eromanga and Surat Basins in eastern Australia.

The brachiopods Ishimia and Shlyginia from the Yuranigh Limestone Member are recognised for the first time outside Kazakhstan and Sibumasu. The presence of the brachiopod Anoptambonites in allochthonous limestone breccia within the lower Fairbridge Volcanics provides evidence of a regionally significant hiatus of 10–15 Ma duration separating this unit from the underlying Hensleigh Siltstone, of Early Ordovician (Bendigonian) age. The sponge Archaeoscyphia?, from allochthonous limestones in the latter formation, is the oldest macrofossil yet described from the Lachlan Fold Belt in central N.S.W.",

An amended diagnosis is provided for T. erroli. The jawbone of C. warrooensis gen. et sp. nov. is of moderate size and bears a single row of teeth with a circular parabasal section. The jawbone extends in an anterior direction beyond the foremost tooth. C. goodhopensis gen. et sp. nov. is a small to moderate sized jawbone bearing two teeth rows separated by a longitudinal ridge. The teeth of the mesial tooth row, the main tooth row, are circular in parabasal section. The lateral tooth row is weakly developed, bearing one or two incipient teeth. T. porca sp. nov. is represented by a small curved jawbone (mesially concave) bearing two teeth rows separated by a prominent longitudinal ridge. The teeth of both tooth rows have a circular parabasal section. The anterior extension of this ridge beyond the foremost tooth represents approximately one quarter the length of the jawbone. These fishes inhabited a Lower Devonian carbonate platform consisting of patch reefs built upon a muddy substrate on a low energy shallow marine shelf which was subjected to frequent storm surges.

Four species, all new, are assigned to three genera, one of which (Bowenispora) is new. The species are Nathorstisporites muricatus, Banksisporites dejerseyi, Banksisporites viriosus, and Bowenispora tumidosa (type species). Accompanying the megaspore assemblage is a profuse miospore flora which is dominated by the genus Aratrisporites Leschik emend. Playford & Dettmann 1965 of presumed lycopsid affinity. Microspores attributable to the latter genus are often found attached to our Banksisporites megaspores (Aratrisporites tenuispinosus Playford 1965) and to Nathorstisporites muricatus (A. cf. wollariensis Helby 1967), thus providing admittedly circumstantial indications of megaspore-microspore natural relationships among the presumed lycopsid parent plants. The currently very limited knowledge of Australian earlier Triassic megaspores precludes any definitive biostratigraphic applications, but the florule is clearly distinct from known Gondwanic assemblages of comparable age.",

The nautiloid fauna occurs chiefly in shallow-water sediments on offshore highs (Parkes Platform and Molong High near Parkes and Orange) of the main volcanic arc in the Tasmanides. This island arc fauna is dominated by nektonic forms. It lacks definite nekto-benthonic forms presumably because deep waters around the highs acted as a barrier to their migration. All taxa except C. gregarium are relatively long ranging and geographically widespread. The presence of Troedssonella in the Fossil Hill Limestone suggests a Llandeilian to early Caradocian age. The fauna is broadly similar to that of the Siberian Platform, Kazakhstan and China, although most elements are cosmopolitan or nearly so. The contemporaneous Tasmanian nautiloid fauna is strikingly dissimilar, and this probably reflects differences in the tectono-environmental settings of the two regions.",

Belemnopsis kuntkotensis var. puenensis Avias 1953 is synonymised with B. compressa Avias 1953, which is the most widespread New Caledonian belemnite and is about Bathonian-Callovian in age. Dicoelites aviasi sp. nov. immediately predates it. Other taxa include Belemnopsis, Dicoelites, Hibolithes and a new genus of Belemnitidae. The New Caledonian Jurassic fauna, coleoids excepted, is generally present also in New Zealand rocks, but not a single coleoid taxon is yet known to be common to the two. The absence of the New Caledonian taxa from New Zealand collections is explained more by a combination of absence of precisely time-equivalent strata, slight ecologic differences and perhaps by non-discovery rather than by zoogeographic provincial differences.",

The distribution of benthic foraminifera in the upper 1.5 m of this core records the Holocene transgression and indicates continuous sedimentation since c. 8,000 radiocarbon years B.P. Amino acid racemisation values for samples of Massilina milletti taken from core #198 are generally consistent with their depth in core. The D/L ratio, taken as an indicator of age, increases with depth. Anomalously high D/L values for the sample from 27–29 cm depth are attributed to slumping and reworking of Lower Holocene sediments, apparently initiated by a sudden seismic event c. 1,700 radiocarbon years B.P.",

The described fauna is from the Beetle Creek Formation (including Monastery Creek Phosphorite Member) and Gowers Formation. Additionally, the enigmatic Cupittheca and some indeterminate hyoliths are figured to illustrate aspects of hyolith morphology. Guduguwan hardmani, widespread in Ordian-early Templetonian strata of northern Australia, is here recorded from the early Templetonian of the eastern Georgina Basin. A new family Gakidae is established for sulcavitide hyolithomorphs with a conch of pentagonally tabernacular transverse section, to include Gaka, Kalkatungu gen. nov. and possibly Dorsolinevitus. New genera are the hyolithid Yalarrnga mara gen. et sp. nov., sulcavitid Kulangarra kutjurru gen. et sp. nov., gakid Kalkatungu murlu gen. et sp. nov. and angusticornid Yuku tjurtu gen. et sp. nov.; new species are Loculitheca kunka sp. nov., Carinolithes tjikilirri sp. nov., ?Sololites kankari sp. nov., ?Shandongolithes thakal sp. nov., ?Gerkella thuka sp. nov. and ?Yacutolituus rakatju sp. nov. Taxa in open nomenclature are Foersteotheca cf. dubecensis, ?Holmitheca sp. and ?Dorsojugatus sp. On present knowledge, the potential for an Australian Cambrian hyolith biozonation is limited in the Early Cambrian, but for the Middle Cambrian, G. hardmani is a widespread Ordian-early Templetonian indicator, while hyolith distribution in the Monastery Creek Phosphorite Member suggests a faunal turnover at or about the incoming of Acidusus atavus which may provide a basis for biozonation in the Floran stage.

    "abstract": "Abstract Four scleractinian coral taxa are described from limestones within a sandstone-shale séquence correlated with the Late Triassic Babulu Formation, Manatuto township, on the northern coast of Timor-Leste (East Timor). The coral fauna consists of three phaceloid taxa, Paravolzeia tìmorìca gen. et sp. nov., Craspedophyll ramosa sp. nov., Margarosmilia confluens (Münster), and a generically indeterminate solitary taxon attributed to the family Margarophylliidae. Ali four corals are related at various taxonomie levels to Carnian faunas from the Dolomites of northern Italy. Previously, only Norian coral faunas were known from the Triassic of Timor. The fauna exhibits both similarities to and differences from Carnian faunas of the Dolomites and helps confirm palaeogeographic affinities with the western Tethys, although during Late Triassic time Timor lay in the distant southeastern portai of the Tethys. Despite isolation from the western Tethys, the presence of two species foundalso in the Dolomites indicates that larvai dispersai occurred between the two areas.

The Geopark concept that began around a decade ago in Europe underpins the creation of sustainably managed geological places for geoheritage protection, education, research, tourism and creation of jobs, even health and well-being programmes. Through agreements with UNESCO, a European Geopark Network and then a Chinese-based Asia-Pacific one have come into being. UNESCO now organises an Advisory Group of Experts for Geoparks within the Ecology and Earth Sciences Division. Global Geopark Guidelines (see http://www.worldgeopark.or) are provided to enable suitably managed sites to apply and be assessed. Australia and its Pacific neighbours have great potential for creating Geoparks because site planning and infrastructure are already in place. An Australian-Pacific network of interested parties began in 2002 and the first selection for possible Australian Geoparks included palaeontological sites with viable management structures. One area is now deemed as the first Australian Geopark and is working towards application for UNESCO Global Geopark status in 2006. The informal Australasian-Pacific Geopark Network now in existence links and encourages people from the spheres of geoscience education and geoheritage, and those already managing sites. It also provides support for identifying key sites, in outlining policy for future directions, management and explaining the implications for local communities.",

This paper places the four genera in the superfamily Cycloconchoidea. Reinterpretation of the hinge structure of Baidiostraca allows us to recognize it as a cycloconchoid rather than a myophorid; the new family Baidiostracidae is proposed. Zhenxiongella gen. nov. is described based on Taselasmodum septatum Guo, 1988 Guo, F.-X. 1988. New genera of fossil bivalves from Yunnan. Yunnan Geology, 7: 112–144. (in Chinese with English abstract) [Google Scholar], because this species differs significantly from the type species Taselasmodum decussatum Guo, 1985 Guo, F.-X. 1985. Fossil bivalves of Yunnan, 319Kunming, , China: Yunnan Science and Technology Publishing House. 46 pls. (in Chinese) [Google Scholar]. These two genera differ fundamentally from other cycloconchids in possession of a strong posterior internal septum in each valve and a pedal retractor scar at the posterior of the hinge-plate; they are included in the new subfamily Taselasmodinae. The poorly understood family Nyassidae Hall, 1885 Hall, J. 1885. Lamellibranchiata II: descriptions and figures of the Dimyaria of the upper Helderberg, Hamilton, Portage and Chemung groups. New York State Geological Survey, Natural History of New York, Palaeontology, 5(1) i–lxii + 269–561, 63 pls [Google Scholar] is enlarged and discussed herein; it seems that this family forms a unique lineage in the Cycloconchoidea. Zadimerodiidae Guo, 1988 Guo, F.-X. 1988. New genera of fossil bivalves from Yunnan. Yunnan Geology, 7: 112–144.

New York State Geological Survey, Natural History of New York, Palaeontology, 5(1) i–lxii + 269–561, 63 pls [Google Scholar]. On the basis of the bivalve faunas, East Yunnan was sufficiently far from West Yunnan to prevent interchange of most species, although one species is common to both plates. On the other hand, a common genus and the similarities between two cycloconchids suggest proximity of East Yunnan and Australia, although these regions have no species in common. New information on the duplivincular ligament of glyptarcids allows these to be classified with the superorder Pteriomorphia, rather than the Heteroconchia, as previously proposed. The comparisons between the eastern West Yunnan fauna and those of Western Europe, where glyptarcids are also important members of the fauna, suggest that the eastern West Yunnan fauna lay at a much higher palaeolatitude than the East Yunnan fauna.",

We describe a novel addition to this assemblage—a probable pulmonate gastropod that manifests features (including shell with an inflated body whorl, expansive aperture, and reduced spire/whorl count) consistent with Succineidae, an extant cosmopolitan family of terrestrial snails. The fossils are assigned to a new genus and species (Suratia marilynae), distinguishable from existing taxa by a combination of traits: shell with sculpturing limited to fine growth lines only, lunate body whorl with a rounded periphery, markedly flattened spire (comprising up to two whorls), which is almost flush with the apical surface and delineated by a deeply impressed sutural 'gutter,' and presence of both a broad columellar plait and distinct columellar fold. The new taxon apparently constitutes the oldest pulmonate remains recorded from Australasia, and extends the known stratigraphical range of succineids back to the Lower Cretaceous in the Southern Hemisphere.

ISSN 0311-5518.Amsassia yushanensis sp. nov. occurs in the Late Ordovician Xiazhen Formation at Zhuzhai, Jiangxi Province of southeastern China. This species is characterized by typical phacelocerioid organization of modules comparable with the other Amsassia species described in recent literature. Bipartite fission, in which a parent module divided into two parts, is by far the most common type of increase in this species; tripartite and quadripartite types of axial fission do occur but are relatively uncommon. Processes of module division are similar to those of A. shaanxiensis and A. koreanensis, and also occurred in tetradiids. In A. yushanensis, restoration of coralla was occasionally accompanied by recovery of a damaged or injured module or group of modules probably following an influx of sediment, as observed in some favositoid corals. Amsassia superficially resembles Lichenaria, a representative genus of the most primitive stock of tabulate corals of Ordovician age, and has likely been mistakenly identified as Lichenaria in the North China Platform. Available information suggests that the validity of a reported occurrence of Lichenaria in the South China Platform is also questionable.Mirinae Lee [mirinae.lee@kopri.re.kr] Division of Polar Earth-System Sciences, Korea Polar Research Institute, 21990, Incheon, Republic of Korea; Robert J.

The genus Clidastes is thought to represent an early radiation of a diverse clade known as the Mosasaurinae. However, most phylogenetic analyses recover the genus as paraphyletic with respect to more highly nested mosasaurines such as Mosasaurus, Prognathodon, and Globidens. The fragmentary holotype of Clidastes liodontus was never figured or fully described, and was destroyed in World War II. Over 20 years after destruction of the holotype, relatively complete specimens were referred to Clidastes liodontus based upon a single, variable character. Another taxon, originally designated Clidastes liodontus moorevillensis in a master's thesis and then elevated to Clidastes moorevillensis in a separate dissertation, has never been formally described and lacks definitive diagnostic characters that differentiate it from the contemporary concept of Clidastes liodontus. Clidastes provides an excellent example of how historical inertia in taxonomic nomenclature can build over decades and skew our interpretations of the diversity, paleobiology, biogeography, and biostratigraphy of a taxon. Clidastes liodontus is a nomen dubium and Clidastes moorevillensis a nomen nudum. I recommend that both names be abandoned. Removal of those names frees us from a burdensome taxonomy and eliminates cognitive biases that hinder objective understanding and exploration of early-diverging mosasaurines, and is a necessary first step toward a taxonomic revision of the lineage(s) involved.",

Both species show remarkable morphological changes during late ontogeny. The earliest holaspides share long genal spines, and long macrospines on the second thoracic segment. Whereas macrospines disappear abruptly in later stages, genal spines are progressively shortened. Consequently, the ontogeny of trilobites of Ellipsocephalidae is revised. The morphology of early meraspid cranidia and ontogenetic patterns in the disappearance of macrospines suggest that this family is closely related to members of Redlichiida rather than Ptychopariida.Lukáš Laibl [lukaslaibl@gmail.com] and Oldřich Fatka [fatka@natur.cuni.cz], Charles University, Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Albertov 6, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic; Petr Budil [petr.budil@geology.cz], Czech Geological Survey, Klárov 3, Prague 1, 118 21, Czech Republic; Per Ahlberg [per.ahlberg@geol.lu.se], Department of Geology, Lund University, Sölvegatan 12, SE-223 62 Lund, Sweden; Michal Szabad [geosz.pb@seznam.cz], Obránců míru 75, 261 02 Příbram VII, Czech Republic; Václav Vokáč [lichas@seznam.cz], Ke Kukačce 21, 312 00 Pilsen, Czech Republic; Vladislav Kozák [vlada.kozak@tiscali.cz], K Moravině 11/1689, 190 00 Prague 9, Czech Republic.",

ISSN 0311-5518.A well-preserved fish skull from late Albian deposits of the Allaru Mudstone near Richmond in Queensland displays a conspicuous V-shaped pattern of indentations, punctures and depression fractures consistent with a vertebrate bite trace. This is the first direct evidence of trophic interaction between vertebrates within an Early Cretaceous marine ecosystem from Australia. The specimen is taxonomically referable to the large-bodied (ca 1 m snout–tail length) ichthyodectiform Cooyoo australis, but the size and spacing of the tooth marks is incompatible with attack by a conspecific individual. The lack of osseous growths concordant with healing also suggests that the bite occurred shortly before or after the animal's death. Comparison with the dentitions of other coeval vertebrates indicates compatible tooth arrangements in longirostrine amniote predators such as polycotylid plesiosaurians, ornithocheiroid pterosaurs and especially the ichthyosaurian Platypterygius. The implications of this as a potential predator–prey association are that Early Cretaceous actinopterygians occupied middle-level trophic niches and were in turn consumed by higher-level amniote carnivores, similar to many extant marine vertebrate communities of today.Lovisa Wretman [lovisa.wretman@ebc.uu.se], Subdepartment of Evolution and Development, Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala University, Norbyvägen 18A, SE-752 36 Uppsala, Sweden (address for correspondence); Benjamin P.

The fossil material includes mandibular bones, cervical vertebrae and several elements of the fore and hindlimbs. After an exhaustive comparison of anatomical characters and morphometric analysis, the fossil specimens are assigned to the psilopterine Procariama simplex. The specimen from La Pampa Province represents the first record of a psilopterine in this central region of Argentina and derives from upper Miocene sediments of the Cerro Azul Formation. Lithological features and biostratigraphical data allow the host bed to be assigned to the Huayquerian faunal stage (late Miocene). The La Pampa record broadens the geographical distribution of Procariama simplex, which was previously restricted to northwestern Argentina.

However, in the succeeding mid-Llandovery (Aeronian), the spiriferides radiated to include not only more species within Eospirifer and Striispirifer in the Eospiriferidae, but also the new genus Iranospirifer described here, which is the earliest representative of the other family within the superfamily, the Hedeinopsidae. The Ordovician species were confined to the South China continent and the Boshchekul volcanic island arc in Kazakhstan, but by the Aeronian the superfamily had spread westwards to various other continents, including the main Gondwanan superterrane (which included Iran) in the early Aeronian, and Avalonia-Baltica and Laurentia in the late Aeronian. The new species Eospirifer ghobadiae and Iranospirifer qarabilensis are both described from the lower Aeronian of Iran, and there is a note on the Aeronian rhynchonellide Stegocornu, which is endemic to Iran and nearby areas.Leonid E.

    "abstract": "Isabel Clifton Cookson (1893–1973) of Melbourne, Australia, was one of that country's first professional woman scientists. She is remembered as one of the most eminent palaeontologists of the twentieth century and had a distinguished research career of 58 years, authoring or co-authoring 93 scientific publications. Isabel worked with great distinction on modern and fossil plants, and pioneered palynology in Australia. She was a consumate taxonomist and described, or jointly described, a prodigious total of 110 genera, 557 species and 32 subspecific taxa of palynomorphs and plants. Cookson was a trained biologist and initially worked as a botanist during the 1920s. At the same time she became interested in fossil plants and then, Mesozoic–Cenozoic terrestrial (1940s–1950s) and aquatic (1950s–1970s) palynomorphs. Cookson's research into the late Silurian–Early Devonian plants of Australia and Europe, particularly the Baragwanathia flora, between the 1920s and the 1940s was highly influential in the field of early plant evolution. The fossil plant genus Cooksonia was named for Isabel in 1937 by her principal mentor in palaeobotany, Professor William H. Lang. From the 1940s Cookson focussed on Cenozoic floras and, with her students, elucidated floral affinities by comparative analyses of micromorphology, anatomy and in situ pollen/spores between fossil and extant taxa. This led to an interest in pre-Quaternary and Quaternary terrestrial pollen and spores; hence Isabel was the first palynologist in Australia. Her work on Paleogene and Neogene pollen and spores during the 1940s and 1950s provided incontrovertible evidence of the former widespread distribution of many important elements of Southern Hemisphere floras. During the early 1950s, while approaching her 60th year, Isabel turned her attention to marine palynomorphs. She worked with great distinction with Georges Deflandre and Alfred Eisenack, and also as a sole author, on acritarchs, dinoflagellate cysts and prasinophytes from the Jurassic to Quaternary of Australia and Papua New Guinea. She also co-authored papers on aquatic palynomorphs with Lucy M. Cranwell, Norman F. Hughes and Svein B. Manum. Isabel Cookson laid out the taxonomic basis for the study of Australasian Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine palynofloras by establishing, or jointly establishing, 76 genera and 386 species of marine microplankton. Her studies throughout her career, although especially in marine palynology, concentrated largely on taxonomy. However, she was one of the first palynologists to demonstrate the utility of dinoflagellate cysts for relative age dating and correlation in geological exploration.",

We describe an isolated frontal bone referable to a new species, Tiliqua laticephala (Scincidae), from the Pliocene Big Sink doline of the Wellington Caves, central eastern New South Wales, Australia. The bone is very robust, is unusually broad and thick, especially around the bases of the subolfactory processes and represents a large and heavily built lizard. The fossil has multiple fragmentary osteoderms in the frontal region, showing asymmetry in shape and thickness that do not correspond to the more regularly arranged anterior head shields of other scincoids. The specimen shares two unusual character states with extant Tiliqua, especially the large armoured species, T. rugosa. Other large skinks related to T. rugosa (other Tiliqua spp., Corucia zebrata, Egernia cunninghamii, Bellatorias major, Liopholis kintorei) are less similar in terms of frontal shape, thickness, sculpture, osteoderm ornamentation, and positioning of adjacent bones.",

ISSN 0311-5518The Hwajeol Formation of the Taebaek Group, Korea extends from the Jiangshanian Stage to Cambrian Stage 10. The lower part of the formation incorporates the Asioptychaspis Zone, which is closely correlated to the Asioptychaspis–Tsinania Zone of North China. This study documents silicified trilobites from the lower part of the Hwajeol Formation in the Sagundari section. Asioptychaspis subglobosa occurs throughout the interval; hence the biozone is renamed as the Asioptychaspis subglobosa Zone in this study. The Asioptychaspis subglobosa Zone of the Hwajeol Formation yields 14 polymerid species belonging to 14 genera. Of these, 11 species including three new species are documented for the first time in Korea. Among other taxa, the occurrence of Caznaia is stratigraphically significant because two biozones were established in Australia based on representatives of this genus: i.e., the Rhaptagnostus clarki patulus–Caznaia squamosa–Hapsidocare lilyensis and Rhaptagnostus clarki prolatus–Caznaia sectatrix zones in ascending order. Owing to the lack of cosmopolitan trilobites, the international correlation of these Iverian biozones has been equivocal. The occurrence of Caznaia from the Asioptychaspis subglobosa Zone of Korea indicates that the Rhaptagnostus clarki patulus–Caznaia squamosa–Hapsidocare lilyensis and Rhaptagnostus clarki prolatus–Caznaia sectatrix zones of Australia are correlated with the Asioptychaspis subglobosa Zone of Korea and the Asioptychaspis–Tsinania Zone of North China.Tae-Yoon S.

The new species differs from all congeneric forms in its special forewing coloration and features of its wing venation. To date, three types of forewing coloration have been found among different species of Aboilus at Daohugou, suggesting that these taxa inhabited different ecotopes.本文根据中国内蒙古中上侏罗统道虎沟组地层中发掘的三个保存完好的前翅，描述并说明了 Aboilinae（直翅目：Prophalangopsidae）的一新种，Aboilus perbellus。与其它同属类型相比，新种具有特殊的前翅颜色和翼脉特征。迄今，在道虎沟不同的Aboilus物种中已发现三种类型的前翅着色，这表明这些类群居住在不同的生态区。Key words: OrthopteraProphalangopsidaeAboilusnew speciesJurassicDaohugou.

This species can be assigned to Cixiidae and represents the first fossil representative of this family from Qinghai Province. Based on the recent single-origin hypothesis and the distribution of tectonic plates in the Cretaceous, we consider that ancient Cixius had dispersed globally prior to the Cretaceous. Through analysis of the habitats of extant Cixius, the palaeoclimate and fossil flora of the Zeku area during the Miocene, we interpret the climate of Zeku in the early Miocene to have been warm-temperate and mildly arid.

Cranial shape variation and phylogenetic relationships of extinct and extant Old World leaf-nosed bats. Alcheringa 40, 509–524. ISSN 0311-5518The leaf-nosed bats in Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae currently have an Old World tropical to subtropical distribution, with a fossil record extending back to the middle Eocene of Europe. The Riversleigh World Heritage fossil site in northwestern Queensland constitutes a particularly rich archive of faunal diversity for Old World leaf-nosed bats, having yielded more than 20 species. We used 2D geometric morphometrics to quantify cranial shape in hipposiderids and rhinonycterids, with the aim of referring unallocated fossil species, particularly from Riversleigh, to each family within a phylogenetic framework, and using a quantitative approach to reconstruct cranial shape for key clades in these Old World radiations. Our sample comprised 21 extant hipposiderids and rhinonycterids, 1 megadermatid and 1 rhinolophid, in which 31 landmarks were placed in lateral and ventral views, and five measurements were taken in dorsal view. The phylogeny used as the framework for this study was based on an analysis of 64 discrete morphological characters from the dentition, cranium and postcranium scored for 42 extant and fossil hipposiderids and rhinonycterids and five outgroup taxa (rhinolophids and megadermatids). The phylogenetic analysis was conducted using maximum parsimony, with relationships among selected extant taxa constrained to match the results of recent comprehensive molecular studies. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the Riversleigh leaf-nosed bats probably do not represent an endemic Australian radiation, with fossil species spread throughout the tree and several with sister-group relationships with non-Australian taxa. Discriminant analyses (DA) conducted separately on each dataset resulted in cross-validated classification success ranging from 61.9% for ventral landmarks to 71.4% for lateral landmarks. Classification of the original grouped cases resulted in success of 81% for each dataset. Of the eight fossil taxa included as unknowns in the DA, six were found to be assigned to the same group as recovered by the phylogenetic analysis. From our results, we assign the Riversleigh Miocene species Archerops annectens, Brachipposideros watsoni, Brevipalatus mcculloughi, Rhinonicteris tedfordi and Xenorhinos halli to Rhinonycteridae, and Riversleigha williamsi and Hipposideros bernardsigei to Hipposideridae. Our results support Pseudorhinolophus bouziguensis, from the early Miocene of Bouzigues in southern France, as belonging to Hipposideridae, and probably Hipposideros. The reconstructed ancestor of hipposiderids was distinguished from that of the rhinonycterids by having a shorter rostrum, and less of a distinction between the rostrum and braincase.Laura A.B.

    "abstract": "Various ichnotaxonomic names have been proposed for microbially influenced sedimentary structures, but despite the historically broad scope of ichnotaxa allowed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, recent opinion rejects these names for the Zoological Code. Nevertheless, such names are allowed by generous provisions for fossil genera (previously form genera) in the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants. Fossil genera, such as Neantia, Rameshia and Rugalichnus, describe various undulose and striated textures of aquatic microbial mats. In contrast, the complex hackly, fissured and microtuffeted surfaces widely called 'old elephant skin' texture have been assigned to Rivularites repertus. The type specimen of that species has been lost since bombardment of Nancy in 1914. The locality exposing the Upper Triassic (Carnian), Grès à Roseaux Member of the Keuper Formation at Gemmelaincourt, France, is an abandoned coal mine, but has waste piles still available for collecting. This study describes a proposed neotype of the ichnospecies, and other fossils relevant to its environmental interpretation. The neotype of Rivularites came from coal measures with interbedded evaporites of a coastal plain, and is a non-marine texture as apparent from evidence of alternate desiccation, intergrowth and healing.",

The group is characterized by its distinctive reproductive receptacle incorporating in situ fruitlets and vegetative organs that are well-represented in the fossil record. Unusually, though, no Nelumbo reproductive fossils have yet been identified from the Cenozoic of India. Here, we report the first such fossil reproductive organ from the aquatic perennial herb Nelumbo, which was recovered in the lower Eocene Palana Formation at the Gurha lignite mine in Rajasthan, western India. The fossil preserves an aggregate fruit with 28 indehiscent, apocarpous and globose to oblong fruitlets embedded within an accrescent receptacle, and a single small central cavity or apical remains of a stigma in each fruitlet. Comparisons with extant and extinct Nelumbo species support attribution to Nelumbo sp. Our unexpected discovery of a fully aquatic plant in the Rajasthan Basin during the early Eocene indicates that a freshwater ecosystem existed there ca 55 ± 10 million years ago; this contrasts starkly with the arid climatic conditions predominant in Rajasthan today.",

Only remains of the trunk armour are known. It is characterised by the long dorsal wall, with a strong posterior process formed by the posterior median dorsal and posterior dorsolateral plates, the posterior median dorsal longer and broader than the anterior median dorsal, a strongly developed posterior internal tranverse crista anteriorly placed at about the middle of the length of the dorsal trunk armour, and an independent posterior lateral plate. It is one of the few antiarchs known from the Early Devonian which has a developed brachial process and segmented pectoral fin. The small unpaired semilunar plate, subanal lamina and other features indicate bothriolepid affinities, and the separate posterior lateral suggests it is a stem taxon within the bothriolepidoids, a group to which 13 genera are assigned. Distribution of 19 characters amongst these taxa is summarised in a data matrix used in a computer-assisted cladistic analysis of the group to produce over 100 equally parsimonious trees. By eliminating poorly known taxa and characters from the analysis and inferring some missing character states 14 equally parsimonious trees were produced for 10 bothriolepidoid taxa. Luquanolepis is regarded as the most primitive member within the clade, consistent with the fact that it is the oldest bothriolepidoid genus so far discovered.

The new tibiotarsus differs in detail from the type and so probably does not pertain to the same species. The vertebra is platycoelous with a tendency toward opisthocoely. It shows that Enantiomithes had distinctive process of vertebral development, different from that in true birds which produces heterocoelous vertebrae. The excellent preservation of the vertebra permits the accurate orientation of fragmentary vertebrae in some Enantiomithes known from other continents. It also corroborates both the existence of Enantiomithines in the Early Cretaceous of Australia and the small size of the genus Nanantius.

The geochronological framework constructed from marsupial data is based substantially in stage-of-evolution biochronology, which is not subject to the formal guidance of a code, or regulation by an authority. Instead, it has evolved through an informal consensus of usage. Principles and practices of stage-of-evolution biochronology and its historical development are reviewed from an Australian perspective. Amongst more recent developments in the discipline are the establishment of the first marsupial biostratigraphy for the continent, covering the Etadunna Formation of the Lake Eyre Basin (Woodburne et al., 1993), and the introduction of novel terminology to express marsupial succession in the Carl Creek Limestone of northwestern Queensland (Archer et al., 1989). The merits of the various approaches to biochronology are examined: stage-of-evolution biochronology has provided, and will continue to contribute to, a correlation framework for a continent with a sparse mammal record not generally amenable to biostratigraphic resolution. Terminology proposed by Archer et al. (1989) is shown to be unsatisfactory.",

Toothplates are similar to Dipterus, although morphology of the skull, parasphenoid and postcranial elements is more derived. Biogeographic relationships of the Grenfell fauna were based on the presence of the antiarch group Sinolepidoidei, also present on Asian terranes during the Late Devonian. A small number of lungfish scales have been described from Asian sinolepid localities of this age, but differ from those of Adelargo schultzei, and other faunal similarities between these areas appear limited. Paucity of eastern Australian Devonian taxa on the North and South China blocks implies that strong biogeographic relationships between eastern Australia and Euramerican localities during the Late Devonian were not the result of Asian migration routes, but the closer proximity of these areas.",

The widespread distribution of several Jurassic species of Procytherura, which occur in both Great Britain and Northwest Europe and in Argentina, is shown to be related to the availability of important migration routes, including the Tethys and the Hispanic Corridor. In the Lower Cretaceous, the very widespread distribution of Procytherura in the Southern Hemisphere, is used to support the existence of important routes along the eastern and western seaboards of Africa, the latter associated with the opening of the South Atlantic.",

Electron microprobe analysis demonstrates that, like its host substratum, Marcusodictyon is composed of calcium phosphate. This, together with the detailed morphology and dimensions of the ridge system, is used to negate Bassler's assignment of the genus to the ctenostome Bryozoa.

These conditions, while influenced in part by structural relationships of soft and hard tissues in the tooth plates, jaw bones and surrounding oral tissues, can also be used as indicators of the kind of environment inhabited by the fish. The disease processes have specific structural consequences, related either to the pathology or to attempts to heal the damage, and usually alter the from and function of the tooth plate or bone. Consequently they can be distinguished from postmortem diagenetic or taphonomic effects, which alter the structure in less specific ways and show no sign of healing. Dental caries, the most common pathological condition in dipnoan dentitions, is recognisable in lungfish from the Devonian of Western Australia, the Tertiary of South Australia and the Northern Territory and from living lungfish in south east Queensland. Other pathologies have a more sporadic occurrence. Key words: lungfishpathologybonestooth platesenvironmenttaphonomy",

    "abstract": "Abstract Near the eastern margin of the Murray Basin in western New South Wales, thick sections of up to 170 m may be placed in the Proteacidites tuberculatus Zone, of Oligocene to Early Miocene age. In this region, this zone cannot be subdivided using conventional stratigraphic palynology, yet some stratigraphic control within the zone is necessary for groundwater exploration. Some pollen types are occasionally present in unusually high frequencies and their use for stratigraphic purposes has been investigated. In order to give precision to the meaning of ‘high frequencies’, ratios have been constructed and a cut-off point chosen empirically to define the high ratios. Those selected are: (1) Phyllocladidites mawsonii, as a ratio of total gymnosperms; (2) Nothofagus (= Nothofagidites) flemingii, as a ratio of total Nothofagus and (3) total Myrtaceae as a ratio of total Nothofagus. In all three cases, the high ratios are useful stratigraphically, giving some of the required control within the P. tuberculatus Zone. The overall control of these quantitative events through the P. tuberculatus Zone is mainly climatic and hydrologic. Their precise expression at any one stratigraphic level, however, may be modified by other factors. The ecological tolerances of the three selected taxa form a series, with P. mawsonii in the wettest habitat, N. flemingii intermediate and Myrtaceae in the driest habitat. The high P. mawsonii ratios are associated with dark grey carbonaceous clays and high Myrtaceae with light grey clays. N. flemingii appears to be associated with channelling of the river systems which would probably produce better drainage in an otherwise swampy environment. Thus at any one stratigraphic level, the quantitative events are modified if the habitat requirement of the selected taxon is not met. In the Murrumbidgee area, the quantitative events correspond to the sedimentary cycles of the southern Australian margin. Presumably, drainage has been controlled by sea levels. The quantitative events in the Lachlan area do not correspond to the sedimentary cycles for here slight tectonic uplift has put this region beyond the direct influence of changing sea levels. This technique may give stratigraphic control within thick sections of a zone, but it cannot be extrapolated to other regions without due consideration of the controlling factors, even when the same quantitative events are identified in the second area.",

Forest wallabies are not known from mainland Australia after the middle Pliocene, but occur in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene of New Guinea.",

New fossil localities from the upper part of the formation yield faunas including Scabriscutellum sp. cf. S. scabrum, Schizophoria, Eospirifer eastoni and Spathognathodus sp. cf. S. remscheidensis which indicate a Lochkovian age. The Bungonia Limestone is intruded by parts of the Marulan Batholith (398 ± 7m.y.) thus giving a minimum age for the Silurian-Devonian boundary. An appraisal of published data shows that there are 20 radiometric dates with good biostratigraphic control from Silurian and Early Devonian rocks. The relationship between the palaeontologically-based relative duration of Silurian and Early Devonian series and stages and the radiometric age of units confined to individual series or stages, provides an estimate of the age of the base of the following: Llandoverian 433 m.y.; Wenlockian 419 m.y.; Ludlovian 412 m.y.; Pridolian 405 m.y.; Gedinnian and Lochkovian 401 m.y.; Pragian 398 m.y.; Siegenian 396 m.y.; Emsian 392 m.y.; Zlichovian 390 m.y.; Dalejan 387 m.y.; and Eifelian 383 m.y.",

A new fossil plant is described from the middle part of the Wutubulake Formation (late Pridoli) of Xinjiang, China. This plant demonstrates at least two orders of branching. The first-order axis has pseudomonopodial branching with alternately attached second-order axes. Fertile units are alternately inserted along the second-order axis, and consist of a branching system and two sporangia at each tip. Sporangia are narrowly obovate with rounded apex and tapering base. This plant is characterized by more complex branching than other Silurian and Early Devonian plants, and is named Wutubulaka multidichotoma gen. et sp. nov., and placed under open higher-order nomenclature.",

    "abstract": "West Yunnan in southwestern China formed an important part of the Sibumasu Terrane during the Ordovician. The Ordovician rocks of the region are exposed at many localities but have been strongly affected by several phases of tectonic activity, especially by the most recent Himalayan phase that commenced in the Paleogene. For these reasons, together with the difficult access to the localities, the Ordovician graptolites and biostratigraphy of this region are rather poorly known. Herein, we describe a Darriwilian graptolite fauna from the Shihtien Formation at Baoshan and Shidian, western Yunnan. The fauna comprises 11 genera and 15 species, including Didymograptus artus, D. murchisoni, D. spinulosus, Pterograptus sp., Hustedograptus vikarbyensis, H. teretiusculus, Archiclimacograptus angulatus, A. riddellensis, Haddingograptus oliveri, Proclimacograptus angustatus, and the dendroids Dictyonema, Palaeodictyota, Dendrograptus, Callograptus and Ptilograptus, indicating an age of middle to late Darriwilian. Two graptolite biozones are recognized: the Didymograptus artus and Didymograptus murchisoni biozones, in ascending order. The graptolite fauna is substantially similar to those of Baltica and South China.",

The sampled succession is located within the Tatapani-Ramkola Coalfield, in the Balrampur District of Chhattisgarh State, India. Diverse and well-preserved palynological assemblages representing non-marine successions were identified and four assemblage zones were distinguished: the upper Permian Zone I: Striatopodocarpites–Densipollenites, and Zone II: Striatopodocarpites–Crescentipollenites; the Lower Triassic Zone III: Falcisporites–Klausipollenites and Zone IV: Densipollenites–Lunatisporites. Importantly, the fossil genus Reduviasporonites Wilson is recorded across the Permian–Triassic transition in this study. Although the affinity of Reduviasporonites has been disputed (both fungal and algal affinities have been proposed), the genus is an important constituent of the palynological assemblages from the upper Permian and Lower Triassic deposits in different parts of the world. Here we report the first record of Reduviasporonites from the Permian–Triassic continental sediments in India, adding another significant data point for their presence at the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB).

Fungal wood-decay strategies in Nothofagaceae woods from Miocene deposits in southern Patagonia, Argentina. Alcheringa xxx, xxx -xxx.Decayed woods from the Miocene, Rio Leona Formation, Santa Cruz, Argentina having simultaneous decay patterns consistent with soft- and white rot characteristics are described. Samples were previously identified as Nothofagoxylon scalariforme. At low magnification, the permineralized woods appear mottled, with discoloured, degraded areas, scattered in apparently robust tissue, consistent with white-rot decay. At greater magnification, the woods reveal several micromorphological features, including differential decay of cellulose-rich cellular components that match soft-rot decay by extant ascomycetes and some basidiomycetes. In addition, decayed woods either appear differentially delignified or show simultaneous decay of all cellular components (lignin- and cellulose-rich), which are by-products of white-rot fungal decay. Additional anatomical characteristics of the decayed woods are consistent with a host response to the fungal attack. Co-occurrence of these two decay patterns suggests soft-rot decay and white-rot fungal decay. In addition, co-occurrence of all the decay features observed also suggests facultative soft rot by white-rot fungi, such as in some extant species that switch between these two types of decay strategies as a means to circumvent plant defences. These data indicate that fungi with soft-rot capacity for wood decay can be traced back to the early Miocene (ca 19 Ma). In addition, this report adds to the distribution and diversity of fungi in the geological record and underscores the ecological importance of wood as a preferred substrate for the association and interactions between fungi with different saprotrophic abilities, which have been fundamental for nutrient recycling in terrestrial ecosystems during the Cenozoic.Carlos Daniel Greppi [greppi.carlos.d@gmail.com] Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales-CONICET, Av.

ISSN 0311-5518.The original holotype and paratypes of the stylophoran mitrate Placocystella langei (Echinodermata) are definitively lost. A neotype is designated here, based on new material collected in the marine Devonian strata of the Apucarana Sub-basin, Paraná, Brazil. Placocystella langei was the first species of Stylophora to be identified in Devonian basins from Brazil. Its range extends from the late Emsian to early Givetian. Taphonomic data indicate that P. langei specimens were preserved in a storm-influenced, transitional offshore environment, and that skeletal remains were few exposed at the water–sediment surface. Considering that the specimens do not exhibit evidence of reworking, it is possible that their final burial was rapid and definitive, which facilitated their almost complete preservation. Finally, taphonomic, diagenetic and sedimentologic data all suggest a shallow infaunal habit for Placocystella langei.Sandro Marcelo Scheffler [schefflersm@mn.ufrj.br] Departamento de Geologia e Paleontologia, Laborat orio de Paleoinvertebrados (LAPIN), Museu Nacional—UFRJ, Parque Quinta da Boa Vista, s/n, São Cristóvão 20940040, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil; Rodrigo Scalise Horodyski* [rhorodyski@unisinos.br] Graduate Program in Geology, Vale do Rio dos Sinos University, Av.

Coral faunas of Late Ordovician (Ashgill) and possibly early Silurian age are present in allochthonous limestone blocks incorporated in debris flow deposits in the Broken River Province of north Queensland. The limestones occur in the Carriers Well Formation and Crooked Creek Conglomerate, which now lie within structurally deformed fault slices, and are evidence of the existence of a former carbonate platform of this age situated to the west.

New taxa present are Wairunalites greeni gen. et sp. nov. and Plasmoporella marginata sp. nov. The fauna includes other species belonging to Heliolites, Plasmoporella and Sibiriolites in common with Late Ordovician faunas of New South Wales, central Asia and northern China. A limestone block in the Crooked Creek Conglomerate contains a few non-diagnostic heliolitine corals, together with rugosan, favositine and halysitine corals similar to those in the blocks of the Carriers Well Formation, but it also contains several alveolitine tabulates suggesting a possible early Silurian age.",

Anacoracid sharks and calcareous nannofossil stratigraphy of the mid-Cretaceous Gearle Siltstone and Haycock Marl in the lower Murchison River area, Western Australia. Alcheringa 43, 85–113.Extensive bulk sampling over the past 20 years and greatly improved stratigraphic control permitted a meaningful revision of previously described anacoracid sharks from the 'upper' Gearle Siltstone and lower Haycock Marl in the lower Murchison River area, Western Australia. Isolated teeth of anacoracids are rare in the lower three (Beds 1–3) of four stratigraphic units of the 'upper' Gearle Siltstone but relatively common in the uppermost layer (Bed 4) and in the lower part of the overlying Haycock Marl. On the basis of calcareous nannofossils, Beds 1 and 2 of the 'upper' Gearle Siltstone can be placed in the uppermost upper Albian calcareous nannofossil Subzone CC9b whereas Bed 3 can be referred to the lowermost Cenomanian CC9c Subzone. Bed 1 yielded fragments of strongly serrated anacoracid teeth as well as a single, smooth-edged tooth. The samples from Beds 2 and 3 contained a few small fragments of serrated anacoracid teeth. Bed 4 is barren of calcareous nannofossils but the presence of a dentally advanced tooth of the cosmopolitan lamniform genus Cretoxyrhina in combination with the age of the overlying Haycock Marl indicate deposition within the younger half of the Cenomanian. The unit produced teeth of two anacoracids; Squalicorax acutus sp. nov. and S. bazzii sp. nov. The basal, laminated part of the Haycock Marl is placed in the uppermost upper Cenomanian part of CC10b. It yielded Squalicorax mutabilis sp. nov. and S. aff. S. bernardezi. Exceptionally well-preserved teeth of the former species span a 5:1 size ratio range for teeth of comparable jaw position. The teeth reveal strong ontogenetic heterodonty with a large increase in the relative size of the main cusp with age and the transition from a vertical distal heel of the crown in very young juveniles to a sub-horizontal, well demarcated heel in 'adult' teeth. An isolated phosphatic lens in the lower part of the Haycock Marl produced calcareous nannofossils indicative of the CC10b SubZone, most likely the lowermost lower Turonian part. It contains teeth of Squalicorax mutabilis sp. nov., S. aff. S. bernardezi, and S. sp. C.Mikael Siversson* [mikael.siversson@museum.wa.gov.au], Helen E.

    "abstract": "Here, we use conodont and graptolite assemblages to age correlate the ‘Sepulturas limestones’ facies of the Acoite Formation exposed at Aguas Blancas Creek, near Altos de Lipán in the Cordillera Oriental of Jujuy Province, Argentina. An association of autochthonous conodont species is identified consisting of Drepanodus arcuatus, Drepanoistodus pitjanti, Erraticodon patu, Gothodus andinus, Paroistodus parallelus and Zentagnathus argentinensis. Tubaria referable to the graptolite genera Acrograptus, Baltograptus and Tetragraptus are also present. This assemblage corresponds to the middle interval of the Gothodus andinus Zone, together with the upper Tetragraptus azkharensis Zone, or possibly the lower Baltograptus cf. B. deflexus Zone, which collectively indicate an early to middle Floian (Early Ordovician) age. Lithological and faunal characteristics of the studied succession imply deposition in a shallow marine environment. We also suggest that the Aguas Blancas section is stratigraphically younger than the other upper outcrops exposed around the town of La Ciénaga, where the ‘Sepulturas limestones’ were originally defined.G.L.

Alcheringa 39, 589–594. ISSN 0311-5518.Liptornis hesternus was established by Ameghino in the late 1800s on the basis of a cervical vertebra (NHMUK-A599) from the Santa Cruz Formation (Santacrucian, South American Land Mammal Age, early Miocene, Burdigalian Stage) of Patagonia, Argentina. Although taxonomic attributions were controversial, the specimen is now confidently assigned to Anhingidae. Recently, however, L. hesternus was designated a nomen dubium because of its uninformative diagnostic characters and apparent loss of the holotype. Nevertheless, NHMUK-A599 has been relocated and is redescribed here prompting referral to Anhinga. A combination of traits are shared with the extant Anhinga anhinga and A. melanogaster, and the material is dimensionally compatible with A. anhinga. The estimated body size of NHMUK-A599 would have been larger than A. minuta but less than A. grandis, A. subvolans, A. fraileyi and A. walterbolesi. Finally, Anhinga hesterna is considered valid and represents the stratigraphically oldest occurrence of the genus in South America and the southernmost yet recorded.Juan M.

    "abstract": "Fifteen species of hyoliths and problematic fossils from the present-day western margin of the Laurentian palaeocontinent (Cordilleran North America) are described and/or reassigned. Early Cambrian strata of this region are home to the orthothecid hyolith Guduguwan buelna (Lochman) and the hyolithids Nevadotheca whitei (Resser), Grantitheca? montis (Howell) and Hyolithes sp. B. Diversity of hyoliths increases in the middle Cambrian, featuring an un-named species of the orthothecid Decoritheca Sysoev, three un-named hyolithid species possibly representing Hyolithes Eichwald and one individual referred to as Hyolith sp. that bears resemblance to the Siberian Linevitus fossularis Val'kov. Haydenoconus prolixus (Resser) is documented from southeastern Idaho, and Doescherina clarki Malinky occurs in west-central Montana as pavements of conchs and opercula on bedding surfaces, with such large numbers of specimens affording an opportunity to further assess the range of morphologic variability within a single hyolith species. The upper Cambrian contains the hyolithids Haydenoconus gallatinesis (Resser), one un-named species each of Crestjahitus Sysoev and possibly Hyolithes Eichwald. An un-named species of the orthothecid Contitheca Sysoev occurs within this interval, as do the unusual problematic forms of uncertain affinity, Attenuella attenuata (Walcott 1890 Walcott, C.D., 1890. Descriptions of new forms of upper Cambrian fossils. Proceedings of the United States National Museum 13, 266–279.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) and Kygmaeoceras corrugatus (Walcott 1890 Walcott, C.D., 1890. Descriptions of new forms of upper Cambrian fossils. Proceedings of the United States National Museum 13, 266–279.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). The occurrence of Guduguwan recorded herein suggests a faunal connection between North America and Australia, and Contitheca, Decoritheca and the possible Hyolithes with Baltica and central Europe. Crestjahitus, Hyolith sp. and Kygmaeoceras demonstrate faunal affinity with Siberia. Whereas Doescherina and Grantitheca are endemic to North America, the families they represent also occur in Siberia. Attenuella is currently known from North America only at this time. The stratigraphic range of Contitheca is extended from middle to upper Cambrian; Crestjahitus from lower to upper Cambrian, and if the species of Hyolithes are authentic representatives of that genus, the range of the genus now definitively extends into the lower Cambrian.",

The cervical vertebrae of CM Zfr 104 have the same distinctive features (i.e., with extremely broad rather than long centra) as those from previously recorded juvenile aristonectines from Argentina, Chile and Antarctica. This new record is congruent with the biogeographic relationships of Cretaceous marine amniotes from the Weddellian Palaeobiogeographic Province (i.e., Patagonia, western Antarctica, New Zealand and southeastern Australia).

Alcheringa 40, XX–XX. ISSN 0311-5518.A new bandicoot species, Kutjamarcoot brevirostrum gen. et sp. nov. (Peramelemorphia), is described here from the Leaf Locality, Kutjamarpu Local Fauna (LF), Wipajiri Formation (South Australia). The age of the fossil deposit is interpreted as early Miocene on the basis of biocorrelation between multiple species in the Kutjamarpu LF and local faunas from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area (WHA). Kutjamarcoot brevirostrum is represented by isolated teeth and three partial dentaries and appears to have been short-snouted with an estimated mass of 920 g. Phylogenetic analyses place K. brevirostrum in a clade with extant Australian bandicoots and the extinct Madju, but potentially exclude the extant New Guinean bandicoots. Morphometric analysis infers close similarity between K. brevirostrum and species of Galadi in both size and rostral length. They, thus, potentially occupied compatible ecological niches with competitive exclusion perhaps explaining geographical segregation between these broadly coeval lineages.Philippa M.

    "abstract": "Two new species of the fossil macropodiform genus Gumardee are described that provide insights into the evolution of early kangaroos. Gumardee has a continuous record from the late Oligocene to the early Miocene and is likely to have become extinct before the middle Miocene. The two new species are the most derived members of the genus. They exhibit some dental size variation, especially in P3/p3, which we interpret as evidence for sexual dimorphism. From the stratigraphically oldest species of Gumardee to the youngest, the dental morphology also shows a progression from bunolophodont to increasingly bilophodont. This trend appears to have occurred in at least four different lineages of macropodoids; however, a fully bilophodont condition was achieved only twice, once in the ancestral lineage of balbarids, and again in ancestral radiation of modern macropodids as implied by the species of Gumardee.Kenny.

The assemblage from the Apium-1 core was recovered from an ca 5-m-thick interval (2756.35–2751.28 m) in the basal Hovea Member ('inertinitic interval') of the Kockatea Shale and includes the following forms: ?Spinomarginifera sp., Cimmeriella sp., ?Etherilosia sp., Elivina sp., Cleiothyridina sp., and Paeckelmanelloidea gen. et. sp. indet. (all brachiopods). The age of this assemblage is interpreted as Changhsingian, as constrained by its association with the palynofloral Dulhuntyispora parvithola Zone. The assemblage from the Redback-2 core was recovered from the 'sapropelic interval' of the Hovea Member of the Kockatea Shale between 3806 m and 3786 m and comprises the following forms: Lingulidae gen. et sp. indet.

Among these, the first local appearances of the lingulid species, ?Otoceras sp. and M. mangaliensis are associated with the palynofloral Protohaploxypinus microcorpus Zone and are interpreted as latest Changhsingian in age. Other occurrences of the Redback-2 fossil assemblage overlap with the palynofloral Kraeuselisporites saeptatus Zone and are considered to be of earliest Triassic (Griesbachian) age.G.R.

Mesozoic Southern Hemisphere tribosphenic mammals are known from Australia, Madagascar, South America and the Indian subcontinent, and are classified into three families: Bishopidae (fam. nov.), Ausktribosphenidae and Henosferidae. These are stem therians, and considerable morphological evolution occurred within the lineage between the Jurassic and late Early Cretaceous. Important dental modifications include a graduated transition between premolars and molars, development of molar wear facets V and VI, loss of facets for postdentary bones, reduction in the Meckelian groove and development of a true dentary angle. Previous classifications of Southern Hemisphere tribosphenic mammals are ambiguous because information from the upper dentition has been lacking. Upper molars attributed to the late Early Cretaceous (Albian) Southern Hemisphere group Bishopidae fam. nov. are now known to possess a prominent protocone and stylar cusp C.

    "abstract": "Late Pleistocene to Holocene-aged microfaunal assemblages are rarely reported in Australia despite their critical importance for palaeoecological studies, as well as their bearing on the megafaunal extinction debate. Capricorn Caves, central-eastern Queensland, hosts three Late Pleistocene to Holocene deposits containing significant faunal records. Excavations were conducted on these deposits over several seasons, with analyses of recovered material ongoing. Here, we report interim results and explore their implications for our understanding of the microfaunal record of central eastern Queensland. Fern Chamber was previously dated using U-series to the Holocene (>7.6 ± 0.2 ka). Honeymoon Suite was dated to >6.4 ± 0.2 ka using U-series. However, new charcoal dates from the deposit span approximately 7.5–15.5 ka, although the association between charcoal and fauna is unresolved. The fauna is likely Holocene. Colosseum Chamber is the oldest of the deposits, and new single-grain luminescence ages and age-depth modelling suggest that the deposit likely spans MIS 1–4. We use abundant fragmentary rodent remains to examine palaeoenvironmental change over this period. Carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of rodent incisor fragments reveal broad diets within the rodent community, and significant differences in precipitation between glacial and interglacial conditions. Rodent long bone histological analyses indicate significant differences in bone metabolism at the family level between the MIS 3 and 2 samples, but not MIS 1. We suggest that these data support evidence for a mid-Holocene arid anomaly in the region, and increased aridity through the Holocene relative to the terminal Pleistocene. The sites contain at least 10 small mammal species either globally extinct or locally extirpated, including the Capricorn rabbit-rat (Conilurus capricornensis), the white-footed rabbit-rat (Conilurus albipes), the plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), Gould's mouse (Pseudomys gouldii), Forrest's mouse (Leggadina forresti), the long-tailed hopping mouse (Notomys longicaudatus), swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus), the white-tailed rat (Uromys caudimaculatus), the narrow-nosed planigale (Planigale tenuirostris), the Liverpool Plains striped bandicoot (Perameles fasciata), the Cape York brown bandicoot (Isoodon peninsulae), and the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus). We also record significant range contractions for frogs (Philoria sp., Neobatrachus sp.) and earless dragons (Tympanocryptis sp.). This study demonstrates that significant changes in the microfaunal community of tropical Queensland occurred between the Late Pleistocene and the late Holocene. It also reinforces how poorly recorded native faunas are from the late Holocene through the historical period, to today. Such records underpin and are thus vital for modern biodiversity conservation efforts.Julien Louys [j.louys@griffith.edu.au], Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia; Jonathan Cramb [jonathan.cramb@qm.qld.gov.au], Queensland Museum, Brisbane, Australia; Kyle Ferguson [k.ferguson81@outlook.com.au], School of Earth and Environmental Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Justine Kemp [j.kemp@griffith.edu.au], Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia; Rachel Wood [rachel.wood@arch.ox.ac.uk], School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia and Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Justyna J.

    "abstract": "While some Upper Paleozoic basins in central-western Argentina have been extensively studied, others have poorly understood biostratigraphy. The current biozone heterogeneity between basins could be an artefact of incompletely sampled invertebrate fossil assemblages preventing precise correlations. Here, we therefore provide a taxonomic assessment of brachiopods recovered from fossil-bearing beds of the El Imperial Formation at Arroyo del Imperial, Quebrada de La Horqueta, and Cañón del Atuel. Two distinct biozones are identified: (1) a conspicuous Moscovian Tivertonia jachalensis–Streptorhynchus inaequiornatus Biozone (TS) from the Cañón del Atuel section; (2) a new early late Bashkirian Saltospirifer guevarai–Pericospira sanjuanensis Biozone (SP) from the Arroyo del Imperial and Quebrada de La Horqueta sections. The TS assemblage includes Argentiella stappenbecki, Oehlertella annae, Orbiculoidea saltensis, Coolkilella aredesi, Calytrixia piersoni, Costatumulus sp. and Septosyringothyris? sp. The SP assemblage comprises cf. Buxtonia riojana, Streptorhynchus inaequiornatus, cf. Septosyringothyris (Precosyringothyris) feruglioi, cf. Septosyringothyris (Precosyringothyris) jaguelensis, ?Spiriferellina sp., Saltospirifer guevarai and cf. Pericospira sanjuanensis.

    "abstract": "The Australian hopping-mouse Notomys includes 10 species, eight of which are considered extinct, vulnerable, near-threatened or endangered. Here we report a new fossil species from the Broken River Region, northeastern Queensland. Notomys magnus sp. nov. is represented by craniodental material from late Quaternary cave deposits. It was a relatively large-bodied species of Notomys with a mass estimated to be ca 83 g. Notomys magnus sp. nov. is immediately distinguishable from the spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis), the northern hopping-mouse (Notomys aquilo), the fawn hopping-mouse (Notomys cervinus), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus), Mitchell's hopping-mouse (Notomys mitchellii) and the big-eared hopping-mouse (Notomys macrotis) by its larger size (especially its longer upper molar crown length). Notomys magnus sp. nov. differs from the large-bodied Darling Downs hopping-mouse (Notomys mordax), long-tailed hopping-mouse (Notomys longicaudatus), short-tailed hopping-mouse (Notomys amplus) and broad-cheeked hopping-mouse (Notomys robustus) by possessing a unique first upper molar (M1) morphology including relatively well-developed buccal cusps, cusp T1 prominently isolated from T4, a relatively narrow posterior loph and an incipient anterior accessory cusp. Fossils of N. magnus sp. nov. are found in association with remains of several arid-adapted taxa, including the plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), the northern pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus yirratji), and N. longicaudatus, possibly indicating that N. magnus sp. nov. was also arid-adapted. Dating of fossil deposits containing N. magnus sp. nov. demonstrates that it was extant in the mid-Holocene (ca 8.5 ka) so it may have been still extant at the time of European colonization but suffered extinction soon after, mirroring the fate of similarly arid-adapted contemporaneous taxa (Chaeropus yirratji and N. longicaudatus). Historical extinctions in Notomys are biased towards larger species (N. amplus, N. longicaudatus and N. robustus), and the discovery of N. magnus sp. nov. adds further to that list. Given the already high number of extinct and endangered species within Notomys, the discovery of another member that suffered geologically recent extinction has conservation implications for modern critical weight range mammals (including other species of rodents) that are particularly susceptible to extinction. Most historical extinctions of critical weight range mammals were in southern and central Australia, but the discovery of N. magnus sp. nov. suggests that species in the tropical north also were detrimentally affected.Vikram Vakil [vikram.vakil@uqconnect.edu.au], School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia;Jonathan Cramb [jonathan.cramb@qm.qld.gov.au], Queensland Museum, Brisbane, Australia;Gilbert J.

    "abstract": "Fossils of pan-carettochelyid turtles are known from most continents of the world, except Antarctica. The fossils that have been described indicate a group of estuarine turtles that have little modified their body form since the Cretaceous. The only species for which ecological data exist is the extant Carettochelys insculpta, found in estuarine or fresh waters in Australia and New Guinea. Here we report the discovery of an incomplete skull of a previously unknown carettochelyid Carettochelys niahensis sp. nov. from an undated fossil deposit within or beneath a Miocene marine limestone formation in Niah Great Cave, Sarawak, Malaysia. The skull exhibits many anatomical features characteristic of this turtle group but differs from previously known taxa in that it has a broad, nasal orifice that is proportionately wider than in other carettochelyids and relatively shallow but wider temporal arches. Some aspects of the palaeoecology of this turtle are inferred.Arthur White [arfawhite@gmail.com] Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia;Michael Archer [m.archer@unsw.edu.au] Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia;Suzanne J.

A total of 4 species of Labechiida, 4 species of Actinostromida, 14 species (4 new) of Clathrodictyida and 5 species (1 new) of Stromatoporellida are described and illustrated. They include the new species Gerronostroma doseyense, G.? apertum, Schistodictyon jackense, Atelodictyon repandum and Hermatostroma malletti. The fauna comprises representatives of Cystostroma, Labechiella, Stylostroma, Actinostroma, Aculatostroma, Ecclimadictyon, Plexodictyon, Anostylostroma?, Nexililamina, Pseudoactinodictyon, Tienodictyon, Simplexodictyon, Stromatopororella, Stictostroma, Trupetostroma?, Amnestostroma and Stachyodes. Included are revisions of a number of C.W. Mallett's species first described in the early 1970s. The genus Nexililamina Mallett is reinterpreted as a clathrodictyid. The history of the ‘less advanced’ labechiids suggests they came close to extinction in the Early Devonian. However, they survived as a distinctive, relict stock in the Lower Devonian Broken River assemblages (up to 4 genera recorded), and lived in close association with non-labechiid components of the fauna.

The Umburridae are included in the Superorder Eupteriomorphia on the basis of the left-convex, inequivalved shell, but show some prionodont features including a continuous arcoid-like dentition below the ligament, the absence of a byssal notch and a nonalate shell. Dental patterns in U. cinefacta change significantly through ontogeny. These patterns resemble, to varying degrees, the adult and/or juvenile dentitions of a variety of pteriomorphian groups including the Cyrtodontidae, Pterineidae, Rhombopteriidae and early Pectinina as well as the Cycloconchidae (the probable sister group of the Pteriomorphia), allowing recognition of homologous teeth and sockets among these diverse taxa. By outgroup comparison with the Cycloconchidae, the Umburridae are more primitive dentally than are the Cyrtodontidae, a family previously thought to represent the stem group of the Pteriomorphia. The Umburridae are structurally appropriate for derivation of the Pterineidae, Pectinina and Rhombopteriidae. In life, U. cinefacta was probably a shallow burrower and pleurothetic on the left valve with the respiratory margin of the shell exposed at the sediment/water interface.",

Explanate specimens of R. mors are found to bear closely spaced, rimmed oscules, and the known range of the species is extended from the Ranken Limestone near Soudan to include the Arthur Creek Formation near Ammaroo. Jawonya gurumal from the Tindall Limestone near Claravale is better preserved than type and topotype material, and demonstrates that the genus is two-walled, and not one-walled as originally described. Furthermore, exopore architecture is much more complex than previously envisaged. The co-occurring related genus Wagima is also considered to be two-walled. Rankenella in the Ranken Limestone flourished in a low-energy, shallow subtidal marine environment subject to episodic higher-energy events that generated ooid shoals and flat-pebble conglomerates. In the Arthur Creek Formation the genus occurs in anaerobic calcimudstone deposited in a low-energy shelf area of limited circulation. Jawonya and Wagima are elements of a spongemollusc association in open shelf onkoid limestones of the Tindall Limestone. Rankenella is among the oldest known intact demosponges. Spiculation in Jawonya and Wagima suggests that the history of the heteractinide astraeospongiid-wewokellid lineage was one of Ordovician reduction or loss of original polyactines in favour of octactines, followed by polyactine reinstatement in the Carboniferous.

ISSN 0311-5518. During the last decade the sequence and composition of the later Homerian (Wenlock) graptolite fauna has become comparatively well known in many regions of the world. A complete and detailed graptolite biozonation has been elaborated in Europe, and partly confirmed in Australia and Arctic Canada. Valuable new data have been obtained from several widely scattered areas within the Asian part of the former U. S. S. R. M. praedeubeli Jaeger (rare) and M. deubeli (common) have been found in the Homerian sequences in the Novosibirsk Islands and Novaya Zemlya, as well as in the southern Urals and the Turkestan-Alai Mountains of central Asia. In sections studied here, especially in the Alai Range, both species have well defined stratigraphic ranges in a variety of pelagic and hemipelagic facies. Their well established taxonomy based on sicular shape and thecal structure allows their recognition in material of different preservation. They belong to a single phylogenetic line and can be used as important biostratigraphic markers for interregional correlation, especially considering the distinct differences in the composition of associated monograptids. Thus, members of the Pristiograptus idoneus—Lobographu? claudiae lineage parallelling the development of M. praedeubeli and M. deubeli in the Homerian of central Asia, Australia, Arctic Canada and Arctic Russia are unknown from European and northern African sections.",

I1 morphology is similar to that reported in undescribed species from the Kutjumarpu Local Fauna and may represent a synapomorphy for Balbarinae. Molar morphology of the species of Ganawamaya is intermediate between that of the known species of Nambaroo and those of Balbaroo. Deep penetration of the masseteric canal within the mandible, as seen in G. acris and G. aediculis and now known to occur in other Riversleigh balbarine species, is suggested as a potential macropodoid synapomorphy.

    "abstract": "A phylogenetic analysis of Recent and fossil species of the genus Amalda (Gastropoda) was undertaken. The resulting cladogram is compared with the phylogeny implied by stratigraphic evidence. The two phylogenies are in broad agreement, and both suggest that the subgenus Alocospira should be elevated to generic rank. The status of the subgenus Gracilispira is uncertain on both cladistic and stratigraphic grounds. Of the two remaining subgenera, only Baryspira is unequivocally monophyletic. Gemaspira and Baryspira are sister taxa in the cladistic analysis. However, stratigraphic evidence strongly suggests that Gemaspira is a paraphyletic group. The implied sister-group relationship is interpreted as resulting from coding procedures which assumed no transformation series between states of a multistate character. Clearly, stratigraphic evidence implies that the synapomorphies linking Baryspira spp. are transformations from (rather than being independent of) the synapomorphies linking Gemaspira spp. This underlines the importance of deducing the correct transformations linking multistate characters in attempting to reconstruct phylogenies. In this case the transformation series implied are counter-intuitive. It is concluded that cladistic analysis of morphological characters has the potential to reconstruct phylogenies provided the correct transformation series are known. These, it is argued, can be obtained through a study of the dynamics of form development.",

    "abstract": "From the record of dinosaurian skeletal remains it has been inferred that the origin and initial diversification of dinosaurs were rapid events, occupying an interval of about 5 million years in the Late Triassic. By contrast numerous reports of dinosauroid tracks imply that the emergence of dinosaurs was a more protracted affair extending through much of the Early and Middle Triassic. This study finds no convincing evidence of dinosaur tracks before the late Ladinian. Each of the three dinosaurian clades — Theropoda, Sauropodomorpha, Ornithischia — produced a unique track morphotype that appears to be an independent modification of the chirotherioid pattern attributed to stem-group archosaurs (thecodontian reptiles). The existence of three divergent track morphotypes is consistent with the concept of dinosaurian polyphyly but can be reconciled with the hypothesis of dinosaurian monophyly only by invoking many and rapid reversals in the locomotor anatomy of early dinosaurs. The origin of dinosaurs was not the correlate or consequence of any single event or process, be it global change, competitive replacement, or opportunism in the wake of mass extinction. Instead the origin of dinosaurs is envisaged as a series of three cladogenetic events over an interval of at least 10 million years and possibly as much as 25 million years. This scenario of dinosaurian polyphyly is as well-supported by fossil evidence as is the currently favoured view of dinosaurian monophyly.",

We review these data and believe they support the following general conclusions. By early Pliocene time (4–5 Ma) many marsupial genera characteristic of the late Cainozoic had appeared. Some species of extinct genera characteristic of the Pleistocene were also present in the late Pliocene (2 Ma). Megafaunal marsupials, notably Diprotodon, and the beginning of the spectacular radiation of a large sthenurine kangaroos, accompanied remnants of Miocene taxa (e.g. Ektopodontidae, and early macropodines like Prionotemnus and Kurrabi), into the early Pleistocene. This turnover, extending across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary, roughly corresponds with the time of northward withdrawal of rainforest from southeastern Australia and its replacement there by open Eucalyptus forest. Dust flux from the continent into the Tasman Sea and Indian Ocean increased in volume and frequency over the last four glacial cycles (400 ka) reflecting the progressive denudation of the Australian inland. Procoptodon sthenurines, the last megafaunal genus to appear, arose early in the Pleistocene near the initiation of 100 ka glacial cycling. During the last glacial cycle (120-20 ka) most of the megafauna including all sthenurine species became extinct.",

They are: Acrothele primaeva (de Verneuil and Barrande in de Prado, 1860), Acrothele sp., Eoobolidae gen. et sp. indet., Genetreta trilix gen. et sp. nov., Iberotreta sampelayoi gen. et sp. nov., Luhotreta? proclinis (Mergl and Elicki, 2004), Micromitra cf. sculptilis (Meek, 1873), Nisusia vaticina (de Verneuil and Barrande in de Prado, 1860), Trematobolus simplex (Vogel, 1962) and Yorkia zafrensis (Gil-Cid and Melou, 1986). Stratigraphic distribution patterns of the brachiopod fauna mirror the drowning of the environment. Trematobolus simplex is exclusively found in the carbonates of the Beleno facies, whereas Nisusia vaticina and Yorkia zafrensis are typical representatives of the nodular limestones of the Barrios facies. The species of the genera Trematobolus, Nisusia and Yorkia demonstrate the affinity of the upper Lancara brachiopod association with faunas of the Siberian platform, New South Wales and some Avalonian terranes (Newfoundland, New Brunswick).",

Taxonomic work reassessed all the genera identified as Leptellinidae in the most current classification. Four genera were discarded, namely Bekkerella, Benignites, Leptastichidia and Nikitinamena. Cladistic analysis reveals the paraphyly of these genera; their abandonment leading to more morphologically coherent subdivisions of the family. Two subfamilies, Leptellininae and Palaeostrophomeninae, are emended and taxonomically restructured. The palaeogeographical history of the Leptellinidae is complicated. The Leptellinidae are first recorded in Baltica in the late Floian (Early Ordovician) and rapidly dispersed to circum-Iapetus palaeocontinents by the Dapingian, thence to most terranes composing Gondwana by the Darriwilian (Middle Ordovician).",

    "abstract": "Abstract An occluded skull and dentaries, recovered from the Floraville Local Fauna, northern Queensland, is referred to Euowenia robusta De Vis, 1891. The specimen has distinctive zygomaturine features including a quinquetubercular upper third premolar and lower molars with cristids obliqua, directly challenging the synonymy of E. robusta with Nototherium inerme and N. mitchelli proposed by Woods (1968 Woods, J. T. 1968. The identity of the extinct marsupial genus Nototherium Owen. Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, 15: 111–116. [Google Scholar]). Comparison with the genotypic Euowenia grata (De Vis, 1887) has further confirmed that E. robusta does not belong within the Diprotodontinae. After examining all named zygomaturine genera, including a large data set of Zygomaturus trilobus Macleay, 1858, it is concluded that Euowenia robusta can not be placed within any known zygomaturine genus and, therefore, a new genus is proposed. It is perhaps the most derived of all the zygomaturines described to date from the Australian Cenozoic.

A brachiopod fauna described from the Late Permian of the Gongri and Lizai villages, northwest of the Qoima Co Lake, Tanggula area, southern Qinghai, northwest China, includes ten species in nine genera. This fauna from the (Qiangtang Block) has a strong affinity to coeval faunas of South China, sharing 74% of its species. In addition, the Late Permian Tanggula brachiopod assemblages also demonstrate a clear link with the Middle Permian brachiopod faunas of neighbouring microcontinents including the Indochina block (Malaysia and Cambodia) and the Shan-Thai block (Thailand), as suggested by the presence of Caricula sp. cf. C. salebrosa, Transennatia termierorum and Strophalosiina. This phenomenon indicates that there were relatively narrow seaways between these microcontinents to enable ready interchange of brachiopods during the Permian, and that brachiopods tended to retreat towards the palaeoequatorial region throughout the period.",

The macrofaunas refine this Early Bajocian age to the early Laeviuscula Chronozone. A belemnite from the Tusk-1 well has a strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) ratio consistent with the biostratigraphical age. All the identifiable ammonites belong to Pseudotoites robiginosus (Crick). Pseudotoites is prominent in the Early Bajocian of the Indo-Pacific Realm, being known mainly from onshore Western Australia and the Southern Andes, together with rare occurrences in Irian Jaya (west New Guinea); somewhat surprisingly, it is also rarely present in southern Alaska. The palynofloras studied from the Tusk-1 and Tusk-2 wells contain abundant specimens of the marine dinoflagellate cyst Dissiliodinium caddaense, and are assigned to the Dissiliodinium caddaense Oppel Zone. The Athol Formation is a correlative of the Newmarracarra Limestone of the onshore Perth Basin, Western Australia; the distribution of both these units indicates a marine transgression onto the Australian block during the Early Bajocian.",

    "abstract": "Colonial scleractinian corals were sampled from three levels within a Miocene marine unit of the Bakhtiari succession, Zagros Basin, central-western Iran. The first two coral-bearing intervals, A and B, contain small-scale scattered colonies and show a poor coral diversity, whereas the third, consisting of a strongly lithified limestone package, reflects a well-developed biostromal framework with higher coral skeletal volume within the Bakhtiari succession. The Bakhtiari succession coral assemblages are characterized by Porites sp. cf. P. maigensis, Porites sp. cf. P. mancietensis, Porites sp. cf. P. collegniana, Tarbellastraea reussiana, Favia sp., Montastrea sp. cf. P. tchihatcheffi, Favites sp. cf. P. neugeboreni, Favites sp. cf. P. neuvillei, Agathiphyllia sp. and Acropora sp. Sedimentological and palaeontological data indicate that the depositional environment is consistent with a mixed carbonate–siliciclastic ramp that was gently deepening basinwards from the shoreline. The hemispherical and massive growth forms of colonies and sparse branching forms dominated the well-illuminated euphotic zone. Abundant domestone and dense pillarstone coral growth fabrics interdigitating with coarse-grained terrigenous sediments developed in the shallow inner ramp environment. Branching forms and meandroid branching colonies together with some massive forms mostly inhabited the low-energy conditions of the lower euphotic to oligophotic zones of the middle ramp. In the middle parts of the mixed carbonate–siliciclastic ramp, sparse pillarstone together with domestone comprises a mixstone coral growth fabric. Fluctuations in nutrient and clastic sediment input, salinity and the growth of red algae likely terminated coral growth.",

Alcheringa XX, XXX–XXX.The trace fossil Radialimbricatus igen. nov. with type species of R. bitoensis isp. nov. occurs in river-mouth-bar sandstone beds of a lacustrine sequence of the Lower Cretaceous Jinju Formation in South Korea. Radialimbricatus is a horseshoe-shaped or elliptical, convex hyporelief structure characterized by imbrication of traces with radial ridges and a median furrow. These features differentiate Radialimbricatus from arthropod ichnofossils such as Rusophycus and Cruziana, possibly cnidarian ichnofossils such as Astropolichnus and vermiform organism ichnofossils such as Oldhamia. Cross-sectional features of R. bitoensis, including upward mud protrusions at lateral margins, demonstrate that R. bitoensis can be formed as an open epigenic furrow at the water/mud interface or an endogenic burrow along the sand/mud interface at the same time. Analysis of discrete and imbricating horseshoe-shaped traces indicates that the tracemaker maintained an obligate inclined posture even when forming trails. The radial ridges and pit along the median furrow are interpreted to reflect feeding behaviour, and the imbrication to result from unidirectional and more or less regular movements to next feeding sites. The tracemaker is thought to have been an organism with an elliptical body outline, radially arranged body parts at the base of or around the body (probably for collecting and transporting foods and moving to feeding sites) and a mouth near the centre of the body, which is consistent with body plan features of arthropods, cnidarians and annelids.Dong-Chan Lee [dclee@chungbuk.ac.kr], Department of Earth Sciences Education, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.",

The Early Permian (Cisuralian) outcrops of the Santa Rosa Group, from southeastern Chiapas, are one of the most important marine Palaeozoic successions of Mexico. The Artinskian–Kungurian Paso Hondo Formation is the youngest unit in the succession and is dominated by massive limestone. Different marine invertebrates deposited in massive calcareous rocks characterize this formation. The buxtoniin Kukulkanus spinosus gen. et sp. nov. is reported from a single bed within the unit. The outcrops are located in southeastern Chiapas, very near the Guatemala–Mexico border. The lithological features and the preservation of fossils indicate that the fossil-bearing rocks were deposited in a low-energy open-waters paleoenvironment over the continental platform. Fusulinids, cephalopods and brachiopods previously described for the Paso Hondo Formation have been correlated with faunas of different coeval localities from Texas, New Mexico, Coahuila, Chiapas and Venezuela, regions that form part of the biotic Grandian Palaeo-Province.Miguel A.

Alcheringa 42, 306–311. ISSN 0311-5518Few Cenozoic lungfish fossils consist of articulated, associated bones and tooth plates. Mioceratodus gregoryi from the Paleogene (Eocene) deposit of the Redbank Plains Formation in southeast Queensland is unusual in this respect because the fossil includes tooth plates and elements of the skull. An analysis of the material and reconstruction of the skull and associated skeletal material provides new insights into the fish and its environment. The fish has a mandible with a wide separation between the lower tooth-bearing bones, and a strong ceratohyal bone. This suggests that, like the extant Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, the fossil fish had a moveable basihyal that could be inserted between the prearticular bones to seal the oral cavity. This would have allowed the fish to draw food, air and water into the mouth, and dig holes by sucking mud into the oral cavity and blowing it out again, all useful attributes for a fish that lived in a shallow freshwater lake. The living Australian lungfish has similar structures in the mandible and hyoid apparatus, and performs comparable actions. The occipital ribs, also preserved in the Redbank Plains fossil, are embedded in hypaxial muscles and not moveable. It is unlikely that these ribs have any influence on the suctorial process in these two species.Anne Kemp [a.kemp@griffith.edu.au] Environmental Futures Centre, Griffith University, 170 Kessels Road, Nathan, Brisbane, Queensland 4111, Australia.",

Two species, Asaphellus intermedius and Conophrys multituberculatus, are new to science. Unlike previously documented Iranian faunas, the early Tremadocian trilobite assemblage is characterized by proliferation of the olenid Chungkingaspis sinensis, which is also known as the eponymous taxon of the basal Ordovician trilobite biozone in South China. This is the first record of the occurrence of the olenid biofacies in the Ordovician of Iran. Overall, both the Tremadocian and Darriwilian trilobite assemblages show distinct similarity to the contemporaneous faunas of South China down to species level. Trilobite-based correlation with the Ordovician succession of South China confirms the existence of a hiatus at the base of the Ordovician succession in the eastern Alborz and a significant gap, with the upper Tremadocian, Floian and Dapingian parts of the succession completely missing in Deh-Molla.Mansoureh Ghobadi Pour [mghobadipour@yahoo.co.uk and m.ghobadipour@gu.ac.ir], Department of Geology, Faculty of Sciences, Golestan University, Gorgan 49138-15739, Iran. *Also affiliated with Department of Natural Sciences, Natural Museum of Wales, Cardiff, Cathays Park, Cardiff CF10 3NP, UK.",

ISSN 0311-5518Based on re-examination of the material used in the original study from the subsurface Goldwyer and Nita Formations (middle Darriwilian, Middle Ordovician) of the Canning Basin, Western Australia, two phragmodontid species (Phragmodus polystrophos Watson and Ph. spicatus Watson) are revised as having a septimembrate apparatus including geniculate (Ph. polystrophos) or nongeniculate (Ph. spicatus) M, triform alate Sa, modified tertiopedate (Ph. polystrophos) or tripennate (Ph. spicatus) Sb, modified bipennate Sc, modified quadriramate Sd, carminate Pa and pastinate Pb elements. Characterized by a carminate Pa element in their respective species apparatuses, these two species demonstrate a close phylogenetic relationship with Phragmodus cognitus Stauffer from the Late Ordovician (Sandbian) of North America. These distinctive shared characters have allowed their accommodation within a new genus, Protophragmodus gen. nov., which represents an evolutionary lineage separated from species of Phragmodus Branson & Mehl (sensu stricto). In addition, it is postulated that the Cyrtoniodontidae might have originated in the early–middle Darriwilian from 'Plectodina' in shallow-water settings, with Phragmodus (sensu stricto), the most derived part of the family, perhaps directly evolving from Protophragmodus gen. nov. in the late Darriwilian and then becoming cosmopolitan, deeper-water dwellers in the Late Ordovician.Y.Y.

On the occurrence of Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus in Australia. Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Third Series 19, 355–356. [Google Scholar], primarily on the basis of skull morphology. This research set out to determine if specimens could be attributed to P. australis on the basis of vertebral data alone. Vertebrae were measured and subjected to morphometric analysis for specimens previously attributed to P. australis, along with several unattributed specimens that either lack skulls or where existing skulls have not been described. Centrum length (CL) plots, together with a principle components analysis and multivariate analysis of variance, suggest that different specimens can be distinguished from each other on the basis of vertebrae. Although our analyses using only basic centrum dimensions are heavily impacted by size, and thus growth stage of individuals, two specimens previously attributed to P. australis on the basis of skull morphology alone plotted separately from each other in all analyses, with one plotting consistently near the outgroup taxon, Ophthalmosaurus natans (Marsh, 1879 Marsh, O.C., 1879. A new order of extinct reptiles (Saurantodonta) form the Jurassic formation of the Rocky Mountains. Annals and Magazine of Natural History 3, 175–176.[Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]). Hence, the data are consistent either with very large intraspecific variation within vertebral patterns, or support the possibility that more than one Australian species occurs in the dataset. CL and multivariate data showed that juvenile ichthyosaurs plot differently relative to all subadults–adults, not only in their proportionately smaller vertebrae, but also in having consistently different shapes with little difference between the length of dorsal and caudal vertebrae. One subadult individual (RGC1) also showed similarity in length between dorsal and caudal vertebrae and has abnormal rib facets. We posit that it could either be an aberrant P. australis, or an otherwise unknown taxon. Although additional material is required, questions raised by this study suggest the need to test the postcranial remains of additional specimens, especially those with well-studied skulls, so as to identify the level of intraspecific variation or any sexual dimorphism, and to determine if any as yet undetected ichthyosaur taxa occurred in the Australian Early Cretaceous.Vikram Vakil [vikram.vakil@uqconnect.edu.au], Gregory E.

Calcareous nannofossil assemblages from these formations are characterized by abundant, diverse and moderate- to well-preserved forms with Tethyan affinities. This study concentrates on two sections (the Gurpi and Kabir-Kuh sections) in the west and southwest of Iran in the Zagros Basin, which span biozones CC25c/UC20bTP to NP6/NTp10B in the Kabir-Kuh and CC25b/UC20aTP to NP5/NTp9 in the Gurpi section. Late Maastrichtian nannofossil abundance and diversity in the studied intervals is high with a sharp decrease slightly above the K/Pg boundary. The K/Pg boundary interval is marked by the FO of Biantholithus sparsus, an acme of the dinoflagellate cyst Thoracosphaera operculata, a notable decrease in Cretaceous calcareous nannofossil abundance and diversity, and the appearance of new Paleocene taxa. An increased abundance of Thoracosphaera is recorded similar to that in the El Kef (Global Stratotype Section and Point, GSSP, for the K/Pg boundary), Ellés (auxiliary section), Egypt, Atlantic Ocean and sections elsewhere in the world. Reworked Cretaceous calcareous nannofossils are recorded from the base of the Danian along with the new Paleocene species.

The sporangia of Y. oblonga are located centrally with sterile axes on the outside curving up and over the apices. The original diagnosis of a synangium is discounted as it was an artefact of preservation, and Hedeia is now considered a heterotypic synonym of Yarravia, with the latter taking priority. Furthermore, the branching pattern of Yarravia is simple and demonstrates that it does not belong with the 'trimerophyte grade'.

Palaeontological and archaeological excavations at this site have unearthed one of the best insular records of fossil bats to date. The assemblage is numerically dominated by the horseshoe bat species Rhinolophus euryotis, followed by the leafnosed bat Hipposideros diadema. In addition to these species, remains of Rhinolophus simplex, Hipposideros sp. cf. H. sumbae, Murina sp. aff. M. florium, Taphozous sp., Kerivoula sp. and Miniopterus sp. have also been recovered. Two taxa found in Liang Bua, Rhinolophus euryotis and Miniopterus sp., are not apparent in the modern bat fauna of Flores. Some specimens, found during the more recent excavations, are known from specific depths. Two age-groups are represented. The stratigraphically oldest is 74–61 ka and includes Murina sp. aff. M. florium and Rhinolophus euryotis. Conversely, the younger, Holocene, assemblage is much more diverse. Despite the relatively small amount of microbat material collected thus far, it displays a higher diversity than the rodents from the site. This is presumably related to the better dispersal ability of bats relative to other, non-volant mammals.",

Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 19, 299–307. [Google Scholar], from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area have remained a mystery. We have recovered new material representing the upper dentition previously unknown for this late Oligocene taxon, and new early Miocene specimens representing the upper and lower dentition of a second species, W. prideauxi sp. nov. We assessed their phylogenetic relationships using matrices from two previous studies, and recovered both species of Wabularoo as basal macropodids. Wabularoo is characterized by having bilophodont molars, large sectorial P3/p3 with coarse ridges, presence of a forelink, neometaconule and postlink on M1–3, well-developed anterior cingulum, precingulum, postparacrista and premetacrista on all upper molars, and retention of StC on M1–2. Although the subfamilial affinities of Wabularoo are unresolved, we propose that several morphological features of the dentary and the upper and lower third premolar suggest affinity with Sthenurinae. These features include short diastema, posteriorly positioned digastric eminence, presence of posterior mental foramen, and similar molar and premolar morphology. If our interpretations are correct, sthenurines arose from basal macropodids between the early and middle Miocene.Kenny J.

    "abstract": "Three hundred and forty-six articulated fossil specimens of two species from the Middle or Upper Jurassic Karabastau Formation of the Karatau Range (Kazakhstan, Asia) were studied to revise two little-known palaeonisciform fish: Pteroniscus turkestanensis and Morrolepis aniscowitchi. Detailed morphological analysis shows that P. turkestanensis, Daqingshaniscus longiventralis and Uighuroniscidae form a closely related group. They are far more distantly related to the Palaeoniscidae than previously inferred. The first detailed scanning electron microscopy of the unique scale cover of M. aniscowitchi is presented. Morrolepis is found to be devoid of denticles on the surface of the bones, scales and lepidotrichia—so far considered to be a key coccolepidid characteristic. However, it bears exceptionally robust lateral line scales. Comparison of the axial skeletons of M. aniscowitchi and Morrolepis andrewsi reveals their close affinities within Coccolepididae. The axial skeleton, despite its rare preservation in palaeonisciforms, may be taxonomically informative, at least at the family level. The Karatau palaeonisciforms, being among the youngest examples of basal actinopterygians (persisting in Asia through the late Mesozoic), possess a set of conservative morphological characters that suggest they were relictual taxa by Jurassic times, thus highlighting some freshwater systems as refuges for plesiomorphic taxa.",

Here I review the cranio-dental and mandibular wombat remains derived from Chinchilla. This material includes both adults and pouch-young specimens. At least five species of wombats are preserved in the fluviatile Chinchilla deposits, although a lack of stratigraphically controlled excavations makes it impossible to determine whether all five species were sympatric. Several wombat taxa are revised: Sedophascolomys gen. nov. is formally erected to replace the invalid ‘Phascolomys’; Vombatus mitchelli (Owen) is recognized as a species distinct from Vombatus ursinus (Shaw), and is recorded for the first time from Chinchilla. In addition to Vombatus mitchelli, the Chinchilla Sand also preserves evidence of Phascolonus gigas, Ramsayia magna, Ramsayia lemleyi and Sedophascolomys medius.Julien Louys [julien.louys@anu.edu.au], Department of Archaeology and Natural History, School of Culture, History, and Languages, ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",

ISSN 0311-5518.The smooth atrypoid brachiopod Thulatrypa gen. nov. incorporates two species, a younger (T. gregaria) from Norway, and an older (T. orientalis) from South China, which collectively span the middle Rhuddanian through Aeronian. In Baltica, the genus thrived just below the storm wave base in a tropical BA4 setting extending slightly into BA3 and BA5 respectively, whereas in South China, its representative occurs in a much shallower assemblage (BA2–3). Their palaeobiogeographical implications are carefully investigated. This study supports the arguments that Thulatrypa may have originated in South China in the middle Rhuddanian and extended its range to eastern Baltica in the late Rhuddanian. Larvae may have drifted along a channel from the east to the southwest of Baltica, which supports the reconstructions of palaeocurrents in the early Silurian in previous palaeogeographical studies.Bing Huang [bhuang@nigpas.ac.cn], Ren-bin Zhan [rbzhan@nigpas.ac.cn] and Jia-yu Rong [jyrong@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing, 210008, PR China; B.

New morphological findings and interpretations (e.g., a slender seta on each leg annulation; a series of articulated cephalic sternites) confirm the similarity of Synaustrus to other euthycarcinoid taxa. The evidence presented here allies euthycarcinoids with atelocerates, but they cannot be positioned higher than the stem-lineage of Atelocerata. Synaustrus and other genera possess trunk apodemes analogous to those of symphylans. Sternal pores in euthycarcinoids resemble coxal vesicles, though this conflicts with other morphological indications of aquatic habits.",

Species composition of the trilobite fauna varies spatially, and a number of distinct assemblages can be defined. Abundant trilobite moult configurations are conclusive for interpretation of the benthic fauna as autochthonous, inferring depth estimations based on benthic community distribution to be valid. A depth-related succession of communities is recognised and indicate the Melbourne Formation was deposited at relatively shallow depths on a broad, eastwardly deepening shelf, with deposition dominated by storm processes. The palaeoenvironment comprised a BA-1 community including the Arcticalymene australis trilobite assemblage, restricted to very shallow depths (∼20 m) on the SW coastal margin of the shelf and preserved in proximal tempestite lithologies; and a BA-5 community group containing three distinct trilobite assemblages dominated by species of Cromus and a deeper water fauna, preserved in distal tempestite lithologies and ranging widely over the shelf at depths in the range of maximum storm wave base (∼50 – 80 m).",

Since then, many regional Ordovician series and stage names have been established and mostly published in Chinese. The present study is a review of these regional units with a discussion of their definitions and correlation to the international standard. Among them, the Ichang series, Neichiashan series, Chientangkiang series, Yushanian stage and Dawanian Stage are most important; all regarded as regional stage divisions in China. The Lower, Middle and Upper Ordovician Series with their new definitions (Webby 1998) are now accepted in China. The global stage names, which have been approved (Tremadocian and Darriwilian), and “Caradocian” and “Ashgillian”, which are potentially to be part of the global standard, should be formally used in China. The Darriwilian Stage is defined in a global stratotype section near Huangnitang, Changshan, SE China. Only two regional stage names, the Yushanian and Dawanian, still remain since the international correlation of these two units has not yet been resolved. The main type Ordovician successions of China are identified, revised and regional correlations briefly outlined.",

The walls of the tubuli are composed of bony tissue indistinguishable from the cancellar bone found in dermal bone. It has many spaces and perforations, and is contiguous in places with the cancellar bone of the external dermal bone. The walls of lateral-line canals have the same histological structure as the walls of the tubuli; they also intercommunicate with them. The tubuli and the lateral-line canals open to the surface through large perforations on the external surface. In Griphognathus the walls of the tubes under the external dermal bone have two layers: the outer one is dense bone, but the inner one has the appearance of calcified fibrous connective tissue of the kind associated with the tissue surrounding the lateral-line canals in living lungfish. The tubuli are closely related to the pore-canal system via canals that penetrate the dermal bone; this same relationship has been observed in Dipnorhynchus and Speonesydrion. The intimate connection between the tubuli and the lateral-line system suggests that they were formed by the sinking of neuromasts into and under the external dermal bone, with their walls surrounded by cancellar bone.",

It appears to have been confined to low palaeolatitudes, representing a characteristic member of the warm water eastern Gondwanan shelf faunas. Trends in the distribution of the Ordovician genus can be observed due to its long stratigraphic range. Prosopiscus was restricted to, and may have originated in, Australia during the late Early Ordovician (Bendigonian-Chewtonian). By the Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian), Prosopiscus had dispersed to other parts of Gondwana and peri-Gondwana, including the North and South China blocks, Tarim, central Himalayas, and the Argentine Precordillera (South America). Possible explanations for the distribution of Prosopiscus are that: (1) there were no oceanic barriers preventing dispersal of trilobites between different regions of Gondwana, thus permitting uninhibited migration over vast distances; (2) Prosopiscus was not restricted to a specific biofacies; (3) a major eustatic transgression during the early Darriwilian may have facilitated the dispersal of Prosopiscus in allowing further development and expansion of marine environments; and (4) a prolonged planktonic larval stage may have permitted wide dispersal. Prosopiscus lauriei sp. nov. is described from the late Early Ordovician (Bendigonian-Chewtonian) Tabita Formation at Mount Arrowsmith, northwestern New South Wales, Australia. The new species is closely related to P. praecox, from the Nora Formation, Georgina Basin, central Australia, and to P. magicus from northwest China.",

New data have been gathered on the taxonomy and stratigraphic ranges of members of the Egregiograptus and Polonograptus plexuses, as well as of some specialized bohemograptids. The stratigraphically well-controlled, succession of graptolite assemblages is important in Ludfordian (late Ludlow) biostratigraphy, the interpretation of the evolutionary dynamics and in phyletic reconstructions of the neocucullograptid fauna. Eighteen species and subspecies of Lobograptus, Bohemograptus, Egregiograptus and Polonograptus are described, including pandemic forms; new taxa are Bohemograptus decorus sp. nov., Egregiograptus dimitrii sp. nov., Egregiograptus klishevichi sp. nov., Egregiograptus rinellae sp. nov., Bohemograptus garratti singularis subsp. nov. and Bohemograptus praecornutus brevis subsp. nov.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three types of byssal notch are present in Permo-Triassic Claraia-like species, i.e. Claraia-type, Pseudoclaraia-type and Claraioides-type. At present, there is no consensus in the use of the generic names. The preferred classification should be both useful in practice and compatible with the rules of taxonomy. For the genera in question, details of the byssal notch are important in assessing relationships because the morphology of this structure may closely reflect phylogenetic affinities. However, a particular feature of the notch may have great significance in one taxon but low significance in a related taxon. In order to seek the best taxonomic characters for classification of Permo-Triassic Claraia-like species, we should follow empirical evidence rather than preconceived opinions. Pseudoclaraia Zhang, 1980 should be considered a junior synonym of Claraia Bittner, 1901 Bittner, A. 1901. Über Pseudomonotis telleri und verwandte Arten der unteren Trias. Jahrbuch der geologischen Reichsanstalt Wien, 50: 559–592. [Google Scholar] because the Pseudoclaraia-type and Claraia-type byssal notches form a continuum within populations. In contrast, all known Claraioides species possess the Claraioides-type byssal notch, which is their synapomorphy, indicating monophyly. The notch is characterized by ventral enlargement due to ventral dissolution and by its contracted anterodorsal outlet due to the accretion of shell material. This is a unique character in Palaeozoic bivalves. It implies that the Claraioides byssal notch must have had a different mode of development than the other two types of byssal notch. It is thus unreasonable to place Claraioides in synonymy with Claraia. A review of the biogeographic patterns of Permo-Triassic Claraia-like species indicates that trans-oceanic dispersal of Claraia from the Boreal Realm to the rest of the world may have occurred during the latest Permian. It is possible that volcanic-winter effects triggered the trans-oceanic dispersal and the tremendous change in Permian–Triassic global biogeographical patterns.

Palaeotaxodonta is represented by two species of Nuculopsis and four species of Phestia; Pteriomorphia by five species in five genera; and Heteroconchia by three informal species. Most of the species recorded also occur in the northern part of Tepuel-Genoa Basin and allow demarcation of new and distinct marine intervals in the Río Genoa Formation, which was classically interpreted to represent continental deposits.

ISSN 0311-5518.Despite being a dominant group in both the Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang biota, diversity of the family Leanchoiliidae mostly consists of monotypic genera, with one genus, Leanchoilia, however, being represented by multiple species from several Cambrian Konservat-Lagerstätten. Here we distinguish a new species of this genus from hundreds of specimens formerly assigned to the Chengjiang species Leanchoilia illecebrosa, and establish its affinity within Leanchoilia by morphology of the telson (distally pointed and fringed with spines), a widely used diagnostic character at the generic level in Leanchoiliidae. The new species, Leanchoilia obesa sp. nov., is distinguished from other species of Leanchoilia by an oval outline of the dorsal exoskeleton and a telson with a long basal region and long spines. The new species is also distinguishable from other species of Leanchoilia by sharing some distinct characters of other leanchoiliid genera such as the wide body shape of Oestokerkus and Yawunik, and tiny serrations on the spinose projection of the great appendages of Yawunik. The mosaic combination of characters at the generic and specific levels prompted a re-evaluation of telson morphology as a diagnostic character in Leanchoiliidae. A new descriptive model of the leanchoiliid telson is based on the development of Leanchoilia obesa, inferred by comparing larval, juvenile and adult specimens. The result reveals that the leanchoiliid telson is a complex morphological unit and a source of diagnostic characters at both the generic and specific levels.Yu-Yang He [heyuyang850604@126.com], Pei-Yun Cong [cong@ynu.edu.cn], Yu Liu [zac.liu@126.com], Xian-Guang Hou* [xghou@ynu.edu.cn] Yunnan Key Laboratory for Palaeobiology, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, PR China; Pei-Yun Cong [p.cong@nhm.ac.uk], Gregory D.

Recent findings have proposed that these are the oldest fossil evidence of serotiny, a highly successful fire-adaptive reproductive strategy common among tree species living in fire-prone areas today. Herein, we systematically describe the external morphological and anatomical features of these fossils, by employing a combination of manual extraction and neutron tomography techniques. We propose a new species of conifer, Protodammara reimatamoriori, and a re-examination of fossil material of the Protodammara type species facilitated an emendation of the genus. Protodammara shares numerous features with extant Cunninghamia, Taiwania, Athrotaxis, and several extinct taxa of Cupressaceae, and is interpreted as an extinct lineage of the early-divergent 'taxodioid Cupressaceae' stem group.Chris Mays [chris.mays@nrm.se] Department of Palaeobiology, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Frescativägen 40, Stockholm 114 18, Sweden; School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment, Monash University, 9 Rainforest Walk, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia; David J.

ISSN 0311-5518New records of holothurian ossicles (Echinodermata) from the Lower Cretaceous Agrio Formation, Mendoza Group, in the northern Neuquén Basin, west-central Argentina, represent, excepting some general mention of ossicles, the first collection from the Lower Cretaceous of South America. The discovery is one of the few worldwide records of holothurian remains from this age. The analysed skeletal elements are associated with other microfauna and nannoflora retrieved from washed residues of claystones and marlstones of the lower strata of the Pilmatué Member, in Área 3000 and Puerta Curaco sections. The calcareous microfossil assemblage is composed almost exclusively of the foraminifera Epistomina loncochensis, suggesting quiet marine environments and low levels of dissolved oxygen in the bottom/water interface. A late Valanginian age is confirmed by the nannofossil assemblage found together with the holothurian ossicles. Analysis of ossicle shapes allows their attribution to molpadiids (Molpadida: Molpadiidae): one two-armed racquet-like single ossicle that remains as an indeterminate molpadiid and a new genus and species proposed for the abundant cross-shaped and star-shaped ossicles. The latter, owing to the presence of four holes and the lack of a spire or some elevation projecting well out from surface in the centre of the plates, resemble two known species of the genus Cruxopadia Reich, but they differ in their arm morphology.Andrea Caramés [carames@gl.fcen.uba.ar], IDEAN—Instituto de Estudios Geológicos Andinos 'Don Pablo Groeber', CONICET, Ciudad Universitaria Pabellón II, Intendente Güiraldes 2160-C1428EHA Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mariano Martinez [mmartinez@macn.gov.ar], Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales 'Bernardino Rivadavia', CONICET, A.

Anatomical revision of the Australian teleosts Cavenderichthys talbragarensis and Waldmanichthys koonwarri impacting on previous phylogenetic interpretations of teleostean relationships. Alcheringa 44, 121–159. ISSN 0311-5518.Australia has two important sites for Mesozoic fishes. The Talbragar Fossil Fish Bed in New South Wales is a Tithonian freshwater lake deposit containing the iconic form Cavenderichthys talbragarensis, first described in 1895. The Koonwarra Fossil Bed in Victoria is an Albian freshwater lake deposit containing Waldmanichthys koonwarri, first described in 1971. Following the tradition of the time, both species were first ascribed to the historic genus Leptolepis. In 2015, these two species were placed into a newly erected family, Luisiellidae, with the Oxfordian–Tithonian fish Luisiella feruglioi from the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation in Chubut, Argentinian Patagonia. This new family was interpreted as a stem teleost group, closer to Leptolepis coryphaenoides than to the crown-group Teleostei, a contrary hypothesis to previous interpretations that placed Cavenderichthys as a teleost incertae sedis in the crown Teleostei. This paper re-examines the morphological characters of the Australian taxa, including 46 previously undescribed specimens of W. koonwarri, from Museum Victoria. Some of the new characters include the special configuration of the jaws and the position of the quadrate-mandibular articulation; the special vertebral pattern at the level of the abdominal/caudal regions; a stegural-like uroneural in the caudal skeleton; and the structure of the scales. Finding the new characters in Waldmanichthys called for reappraisals of the morphology of Cavenderichthys and Luisiella. In the case of Cavenderichthys, 34 specimens were re-examined, but for specimens of Luisiella, a conservative approach was followed, based on its last morphological description as well as photographs taken more recently. The systematic position of the three Gondwanan taxa was re-evaluated using a pre-existing data matrix including 240 characters and 56 taxa. The new results give a very different scenario, with the three taxa now included in the crown-group Teleostei. The family Luisiellidae is restricted to its type species L. feruglioi. The two Australian fish genera cluster together with the Late Jurassic European genera Leptolepides and Orthogonikleithrus and are now ascribed to the family Orthogonikleithridae. The new results suggest that the three Gondwanan genera are stem taxa to the Osteoglossocephala (osteoglosomorphs plus more advanced teleosts), and their combination of morphological characters has a major effect on the interpretation of basal euteleosts, questioning some previous interpretations, as for instance, the homology of the stegural as an euteleostean character.Lynne B.

ISSN 0311-5518Artematopodidae is a small polyphagan family forming one of the basal lineages of Elateroidea. Fossil artematopodids are rare and thus far confined to Eocene Baltic amber. Here, we report the first artematopodid, Electribius palaeomexicanus sp. nov., from Mexican amber. The fossil is placed in Electribius as supported by the following combination of characters: the presence of a setose cavity between the antennal insertion and eye, a shallow groove at the base of the pronotum connecting a pair of cavities, the elytral sutural stria deepened at the apex, and having an indistinct median part of suture between abdominal ventrites 3–5. Electribius palaeomexicanus is compared with all known Electribius species, and it is easily distinguished by its body colour, intercoxal process shape, and length of the longitudinal median ridge on ventrite 5. The new discovery suggests that the modern Central American endemic Electribius has survived in this region at least since the mid-Miocene. It provides new insights into the origin and evolution of Electribius through the Cenozoic.Hao Wu [mason007343@163.com] and Ming Ding [dijanet@163.com], Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, No. 6 of West Lake Culture Plaza, Hangzhou, 310014, PR China; David Coty [coty.david@gmail.com], Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Institut de Systématique, Evolution, Biodiversité, ISYEB, UMR 7205 CNRS UPMC EPHE, CP50, 45 rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",

Alcheringa 39, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518Fossils of the two mid-sized dromornithid species classified in Ilbandornis are re-examined. A study of the large series of fossils from the late Miocene (ca 9–7 Ma) Alcoota Local Fauna shows that the holotypes of Ilbandornis woodburnei Rich and Ilbandornis lawsoni Rich, a femur and a tarsometatarsus, respectively, pertain to separate taxa. However, the femora and tibiotarsi of these species have been confused in the past. We provide qualitative descriptions and morphometrics to discriminate the limb bones, which overlap in absolute size. Ilbandornis woodburnei is characterized by short tarsometatarsi, tibiotarsi with relatively broad distal ends, and femora with a broad sulcus patellaris. In contrast, I. lawsoni has very elongate tarsometatarsi, slender tibiotarsi with relatively narrow distal ends, and femora with a narrow sulcus patellaris. Two morphotypes of the proximal pedal phalanges are present in the Alcoota LF. These manifest overlapping length ranges but are distinguished by relative robustness and other details of shape. For each phalanx II.1, III.1 and IV.1, those referred to I. lawsoni are more slender than those referred to I. woodburnei, with, for example, the trochlea articularis of II.1 and the proximal width of III.1 as a proportion of length, both more transversely compressed. Examination of the dromornithids from the middle Miocene Bullock Creek Local Fauna (ca 15–12 Ma), previously referred to? Bullockornis sp., and the late Miocene Ongeva LF (ca 7–6 Ma) reveals that two species of Ilbandornis are present in each fauna. On available data, these are indistinguishable from I. lawsoni and I. woodburnei, attesting to the continuity of these lineages minimally from 12 Ma to 7 Ma in parallel with a Dromornis lineage.Trevor H.

The Aralka Formation, a proven hydrocarbon source in the Northern Territory, previously mapped in only the northeastern part of the Amadeus Basin, is now recognized across much of the basin. The discovery of new outcrop and drillhole intersections with stromatolite occurrences has prompted systematic revision of stromatolites in the Aralka Formation and analysis of their distribution. The stromatolites include a new Group and Form, Atilanya fennensis, which has a distinctive pillared microstructure giving rise to a characteristic wrinkled lamina pattern of bioherms. The previously defined Tungussia inna is emended to include observations from new localities; robust bridging, columns that rarely develop for more than a few centimetres without interruption as a result of bridges being so profuse, and a wall that ranges from continuous to patchy. In situ occurrences of Tungussia inna are now known from ten localities in the Amadeus Basin, stratigraphically constrained within the Aralka Formation. Likewise, in situ Atilanya fennensis is, thus far, unique to the Aralka Formation, although similar forms elsewhere in the Centralian Superbasin and Adelaide Rift Complex are yet to be investigated.Heidi-Jane Allen [heidi.allen@dmp.wa.gov.au], Kathleen Grey [kath.grey@dmp.wa.gov.au] and Peter Wyatt Haines [peter.haines@dmp.wa.gov.au], Geological Survey of Western Australia, 100 Plain Street, East Perth WA, 6004.",

South polar greenhouse insects (Arthropoda: Insecta: Coleoptera) from the mid-Cretaceous Tupuangi Formation, Chatham Islands, eastern Zealandia. Alcheringa 40, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518Rare insect body fossils have been discovered for the first time after 175 years of research on the Chatham Islands, eastern 'Zealandia'. The coleopteran (beetle) insects, dated to ca 95 Ma and extracted from fine-grained, upper delta plain facies in the lower Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian–lowermost Turonian) Tupuangi Formation at Waihere Bay on the remote Pitt Island, represent the most southern, polar-latitude (ca 70–80°S) faunal assemblage from the Cretaceous recorded to date. Three species are represented in the insect fauna: a portion of a segmented abdomen of a probable carabid? ground beetle and two distinct coleopteran elytra, one preserved with a brilliantly iridescent carapace upon discovery, comparable with Cretaceous taxa within the Buprestidae (metallic wood borers), but identification with the Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles) or Tenebrionidae (darkling beetles) can not be discounted entirely. Another specimen has more weakly preserved greenish iridescence and has a morphology consistent with Carabidae; given the preservational deficiencies and rarity of material, the specimens are attributed to Buprestidae? genus et species indeterminate and Carabidae? genus et species indeterminate A and B, respectively. These coleopteran fossils represent the only recorded iridescence in Mesozoic invertebrates from Zealandia. Importantly, these mid-Cretaceous insects existed in South Polar forests near the height of the 'hothouse' phase of relatively warm, alternating intervals of full daylight in the summer months and total darkness during the winter, before eastern Zealandia diverged at ca 83 Ma from the Marie Byrd Land region of West Antarctica, as part of the final break-up of Gondwana.Jeffrey D.

The phylogenetic relevance of the sacrum among macronarian sauropods: insights from a pelvis from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina. Alcheringa 41, xxx–xxx. ISSN 0311-5518.Anatomical variation in the sacrum is useful for differentiating sauropod lineages. Morphological variation in the sacrum has been underestimated mainly because of its anatomical complexity and uncertain homologies with presacral and postsacral elements. We describe a titanosaurian sauropod pelvis (MLP 46-VIII-21-2) from Plottier (Neuquén Province, Argentina) collected in the 1940s from Coniacian–Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) strata. The degree of bone fusion in the specimen (fused vertebral centra forming a single rod, with neural arches fused to the corresponding centrum and to adjacent neural arches) indicates a late ontogenetic age. The presence of a space between the first vertebra and the anterior margin of the illium, together with a scar located on the anterior part of the preactabular process, suggest the possible presence of a sixth sacral vertebra (putative dorsosacral additional characters present in the ilium point towards affinities with Titanosauria. The completeness and good preservation of the specimen allowed us to track features along the sacral series and to compare characters with other sauropods. Within a phylogenetic context, and based on the pattern present in basal sauropodomorphs, the presence of three sacral elements attached to the rim of the acetabulum in eusauropods opens the possibility for considering such elements as primordial sacrals.Florencia S.

    "abstract": "The mid-latitude, cool-water, high-energy Lincoln and Lacepede Shelves along the southern Australian margin are covered with mixed Holocene and Pleistocene sediments. Foraminiferal specimens of Recent and Pleistocene age from dredge samples are strongly mixed. Eight assemblages in two major groups A and B were recognised from the inner shelf to the upper slope, and they appear to be depth-related. However, some are typical of localised environments such as an upwelling zone (assemblage A2) or areas strongly affected by a high accumulation of relict specimens indicative of previous lagoonal deposition (assemblages A3 and A4). Sediment starvation due to strong wave abrasion is largely responsible for the preservation of this mixed biofacies. The interaction between shelf waters (the Great Australian Bight Current), waters from the Spencer and St. Vincent Gulfs, oceanic waters and waters from the River Murray, is suggested as the main factor controlling the overall distribution pattern of foraminifera. A warmer, nearly oligotrophic condition on the Lincoln Shelf, signalling a warmer regime, is indicated by a higher abundance of warmwater planktonic species and by a higher faunal diversity. On the Lacepede Shelf, the diversity is lower and warm-water forms are less common, implying a cooler or mesotrophic condition. These differences may be due to the position of Kangaroo Island which blocks the passage of the shelf water flowing to the southeast, thereby creating two different water regimes. This barrier would have been more significant during the late Pleistocene, when sealevel was low, the shelves were narrower and a lagoonal environment was present as indicated by different relict faunas on these two shelves.",

The final growth surface of Salairella sp. shows skeletal distortion characterised by long, rather continuous coenosteles and coenostroms with upturned edges. This distorted interface was probably the result of spatial competitive interaction between the encrusting chaetetid and the underlying stromatoporoid. Neither sediment infilling, erosion or surface breakage occurs on the final growth surface of the stromatoporoid skeleton. As such, the growth of the Salairella sp. specimen appears to have been supressed by the encrusting chaetetid. Worm tubes are continuous through the distorted interface without interruption. The skeletal association also suggests that the round, straight, vertical tubes had a symbiotic intergrowth relationship initially with the stromatoporoid and, subsequently, the chaetetid.",

    "abstract": "Impressions of what appear to be pedal digits II and III of a bird have been found in the Eocene Redbank Plains Formation, Brisbane, Queensland. These represent some of the oldest Cainozoic avian fossils from Australia. The broad phalanges and the phalangeal proportions indicate that the Redbank Plains bird foot was from a ground dweller. Paired processes for the flexor tendons on the proximoventral margin of phalanx 1 digit III are absent. Relative proportions of the phalanges and number of phalanges in digits II and III are similar to those of dromornithids. These two characters shared with dromornithids suggest that the Redbank Plains bird may represent the oldest known member of that clade.",

The phosphate-replaced shell wall contains two shell layers, the inner layer of lamello-fibrillar structure and the outer layer of vertical acicular structure. The lamello-fibrillar structure consists of several laminae, each of which is formed by mostly parallel fibrillae; in adjacent laminae the fibrillae run in a different direction, forming a crossed pattern in dorsal view. The shell sculpture consists of scales, which are asymmetrical in fractured sections; the steep side of a scale abuts the gently sloping one of the adjacent scale. The microstructure of R. cambrina, a layered, composite shell, suggests an affinity with the Mollusca.",

Character analysis supports the placement of this new taxon within the dasyurid subfamily Dasyurinae. Derived dasyuromorphian features common to A. chinchillaensis and most dasyurines include: reduction of P3, reduction of stylar cusp B on M1; reduction of metaconids; approximation of stylar cusp B and the metacone on M1; alignment of the postmetacrista on M1 with the long axis of the maxilla and an oblique orientation of the hypocristids with respect to the long axis of the teeth. However in most instances, A. chinchillaensis is less specialised than other members of the subfamily for characters considered. One derived dental feature, reduction of the entoconid, may indicate a special relationship with ‘parantechinines’, Dasyuroides and/or Dasycercus. Additionally, the presence of this feature is suggestive of an open woodland/seasonal habitat. Autapomorphic P3 morphology compounds difficulties with the phylogenetic placement of this taxon.",

Following a brief marine transgression, basin conditions of the overlying Java Group in New York and the upper Foreknobs Formation in the central Appalachians were quite different. Sedimentation decreased in intensity and the basin was much shallower, with a broad sublittoral shelf and gentle offshore gradients. The gentler environmental gradients of Java-late Foreknobs time yield a three-fold pattern of community development along an onshore-offshore transect in contrast to a two-fold pattern in the earlier late West Falls-early Foreknobs environments. Communities characteristic of deep water environments earlier in late West Falls-early Foreknobs time are displaced farther offshore in Java-late Foreknobs time, and outer platform and prodelta regions develop diverse species assemblages not present previously.",

This paper describes the incomplete skull and postcranial skeleton of a new temnospondyl from the Early Triassic Arcadia Formation of Queensland. The fossil is a trematosaurian (sensu Warren & Black, 1985) by virtue of its lack of a lacrimal, absence of tabular horn and otic notch and presence of a palatoquadrate fissure. Although the specimen has no palate preserved it nevertheless exhibits several features which we believe to be diagnostic of the Family Rhytidosteidae. These include the shape of the exoccipital condyles and the presence of divided intercentra associated with at least some of the presacral vertebrae. The genus is distinctive in the deeply concave rear skull margin which lacks tabular projections, in its reduced post temporal fenestra, in the presence of a flange traversing the posterolateral parts of the tabular and squamosal, in its unusually well developed pleurocentra and elongate neural arches, and in its well ossified scapulocoracoid. It is of interest also in the presence of probable gastroliths and ‘ventral ribs’. Keywords: AmphibiaRhytidosteidaeEarly TriassicArcadia Fm.Queenslandnew taxa",

Comparison with spore assemblages from sedimentary basins in Western Australia indicates that the central Australian assemblage is dateable within the post-early Frasnian to pre-late Famennian interval. Fish remains and spores previously described from the Parke Siltstone at the base of the Pertnjara Group are of probable early Frasnian age, so it now appears that the entire group was deposited during the Late Devonian. The Brewer Conglomerate is of synorogenic origin, and was deposited during uplift associated with the Alice Springs Orogeny; the spore data thus indicate that this tectonic event began in the Late Devonian. Isotopic age determinations in the Arltunga Nappe Complex and the Strangways Range of the Arunta Block have yielded Early Carboniferous dates. These possibly reflect a later stage of deformation than that which was responsible for the deformation and folding of the Brewer Conglomerate.",

Morphology of the gerontic whorl in Anoriostoma sinistra and Garraspira imtsitata suggests their limited mobility during the last ontogenetic stage.

Cellaria gigantea Maplestone is also reassigned to Nudicella. Colonies of this genus display a wide variety of growth forms, including cribrate fenestrate, flat robust branching, foliose, delicate branching and encrusting; their occurrences correlate with changes in sedimentary facies and palaeoenvironments. The distinctive cribrate style of fenestrate growth form has evolved convergently in unrelated bryozoan groups at various geological intervals. It is found in a wide variety of sedimentary facies, as in other coexisting opportunistic genera such as Celleporaria, indicating a wide ecological tolerance. The oldest recorded occurrence of Nudicella is in the Paleocene of north western Australia. From there it appears to spread south in the Eocene and then east towards the Otway Basin in southeastern Australia, where it occurs in the Oligocene and Miocene; no post-Miocene representatives of this genus are yet known.

    "abstract": "The distribution of benthic foraminifera in Miocene deposits of the continental margin of southeastern South America is compared with that in the Recent. The comparison indicates that Miocene zoogeographic boundaries were located in higher latitudes than at present, suggesting that the climate at that time was warmer than now. In the Pliocene, temperatures were lower than at present. This signifies that a considerable decrease in water temperature took place in the latest Miocene or at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary in the southwestern Atlantic. The main reason for this drop in temperature was the opening of the Drake Passage and the establishment of the Circumpolar Antarctic Current and a branch — the Malvin Current. The opening resulted from strong orogenic movements, in the latest Miocene, which created the main part of the Andes. Prior to the opening of the passage, the anticyclonic (counterclockwise) gyre of surface currents in the South Atlantic was much larger and warm Brazilian waters reached higher latitudes. The Austral Strait, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, may have existed from the Cretaceous in the southern part of South America, but its location and character did not permit the establishment of the true Circumpolar Antarctic Current. The Austral Strait was closed simultaneously with the opening of the Drake Passage.",

The South Australian specimens of the cypraeids Umbilia leptorhyncha (McCoy, 1877) and Lyncina (Austrocypraea) contusa (McCoy, 1877) are re-examined. Umbilia caepa sp. nov. differs from U. leptorhyncha in its smaller size, more strongly pyriform shape, weaker and less extensive apertural dentition, plate-like columellar margin of the posterior canal and more extensive basal flanges. True U. leptorhyncha is also recorded from the Cadell Formation of South Australia, demonstrating that the two species were sympatric in the Murray Basin. The specimens originally referred to Cypraea contusa var. from the Cadell Formation have had a confusing taxonomic history and they are here named as a new species Lyncina (Austrocypraea) cadella sp. nov. The new species differs from true L. (A.) contusa in its smaller size, less extensive malleations of the dorsal surface, fewer apertural teeth and a projecting internal margin of the fossula.

The strict consensus of a parsimony analysis of 68 coelurosaur taxa places this theropod within Deinonychosauria with an unresolved relationship with the other members of the clade. Support for this clade was based on two unambiguous synapomorphies: maxillary dentition with at least some teeth lacking denticles anteriorly, and ungual and penultimate pedal phalanx II highly modified for hyperextension, with ungual II being more strongly curved and substantially larger than that of digit III. The finding of a new small theropod specimen in the Öösh Formation adds to the deinonychosaur fossil record from the same beds, until now restricted to the dromaeosaurid Shanag ashile.",

ISSN 0311-5518.A remarkable new genus and species of rove beetle, Eocenostenus fossilis gen. et sp. nov., is described and figured based on one well-preserved specimen from the late Eocene of Monteils (near Alès, Gard, France). Eocenostenus is definitively placed in the extant subfamily Steninae, based on the combination of dense and coarse body punctation, globular and protruding eyes, exposed and closely spaced antennal insertions on the vertex, and six visible abdominal terga. Eocenostenus differs from the two extant stenine genera Stenus and Dianous most notably in the structure of the prothorax, which is strongly transverse and with unusual anterolateral projections, and in the anteriorly placed antennal insertions. This new discovery highlights the palaeodiversity of a genus-poor subfamily and suggests that the early diversification of Steninae is probably complicated.Chenyang Cai [caichenyang1988@163.com] and Diying Huang [dyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 East Beijing Rd., Nanjing 210008, PR China; Dave J Clarke [dclarke@fieldmuseum.org], Integrative Research Center, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 S Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605, USA; and André Nel [anel@mnhn.fr], Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Institut de Systématique, Evolution, Biodiversité, ISYEB, UMR 7205 CNRS UPMC EPHE, CP50, 45 rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.

The informally named Septembersø formation is a 76 m thick succession of microbial and peritidal shelf carbonates deposited on the North-East Greenland shelf of Laurentia. The formation, assigned to the lower part of the Cape Weber Formation in all previous studies, lies disconformably upon the Skullrockian Antiklinalbugt Formation (revised) and conformably below the Tulean to Blackhillsian Cape Weber Formation (revised) in the Fimbulfjeld Group.

ISSN 0311-5518A review of Monostychia, a stratigraphically important clypeasteroid echinoid genus in southern Australian Oligocene/Miocene strata, reveals uncertainty in relation to morphological features used in taxonomy. The result is that the exact systematic position of the genus remains unresolved at subfamily level. Monostychia and its type species, M. australis, are redescribed. Monostychia australis is restricted to the lower to middle Miocene Glenforslan Formation of the Murray Basin. Three other species currently within Monostychia, M. etheridgei, M. loveni and M. elongata, are discussed. Although it is concluded that M. etheridgei belongs in the genus and is a distinct species, the taxonomic position of M. loveni is questioned, and the validity of M. elongata as a separate species from M. australis remains uncertain. This work lays the foundation for further revisions of Monostychia with an expectation that such work will provide the basis for character determination that may be useful across other echinoid taxa.Tony Sadler [t.sadler@uq.edu.au] and Stephen J.

The group stratigraphically ranges from the Devonian to recent. The Lower Cretaceous (middle–upper Aptian) Koonwarra Fossil Bed in Australia contains a new species of anostracan, which we describe here. The Koonwarra Fossil Bed is famous for its rich fossil assemblage of avian-line dinosaur feathers, bony fish, insects and aquatic invertebrates that were preserved in the fine bottom sediments of a restricted montane waterbody. Previously, the Koonwarra Fossil Bed anostracans were classified as taxonomically indeterminate; however, we show that they are potentially attributable to Thamnocephalidae based on the egg shape found in gravid female individuals. Notably, all of the recovered Koonwarra Fossil Bed anostracans (∼40 individuals) are either females or juveniles. This suggests that the species might have undergone parthenogenic reproduction. Furthermore, the preservation of the fossils resembles experimentally decayed modern anostracans, evidencing decay-induced fabrics that retained remnants of the cuticle, digestive tract and internal anatomy to varying degrees.Emma Van Houte [vanh1629@fredonia.edu], Department of Geology and Environmental Sciences, SUNY Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063, USA; Thomas A.

However, despite the fact that this was the first dinosaur tooth found in Australia (and the only one prior to 1963), this specimen was not, and has never been, formally described. Herein, we describe this opalized theropod tooth, which almost certainly derives from the Griman Creek Formation (Upper Cretaceous; lower to mid-Cenomanian). Despite its relatively poor preservation, several morphological features are consistent with attribution to Megaraptoridae. Smith Woodward’s theropod tooth can now be recognized as one of the first megaraptorid fossils found worldwide.

The oldest records of Glyptodontinae occur in northern South America with Boreostemma from the middle Miocene–Pliocene. A later radiation incorporated the austral representatives ‘Glyptodontidium tuberifer’, ‘Paraglyptodon’ spp., Glyptodon munizi, Glyptodon reticulatus and Glyptodon jatunkhirkhi in the late Miocene–Late Pleistocene of southern South America, and the septentrional representatives Glyptotherium texanum and Glyptotherium cylindricum in the Pliocene–Late Pleistocene of North America, Central America and northeastern South America. Although knowledge of North and South American forms has increased in recent years, records from Central America are still scarce and fragmentary. Here we describe the most complete Central American glyptodontine fossils documented to date, which were recovered from the latest Pleistocene of Guatemala. The remains comprise: (1) an incomplete skull, the right and left hemimandibles, a fragmentary pelvis, cervical and caudal vertebrae, and articulated and isolated osteoderms; (2) a fragmentary pelvis, left hind limb (incomplete autopodium) and seven caudal vertebrae; (3) most of a dorsal carapace; (4) six incomplete caudal armature rings; and (5) a left hemimandible with complete dental series. Comparative assessment indicates that these remains are referrable to G. cylindricum. The presence of this species in northern Central America and northern South America during the latest Pleistocene spans more than 2200 km, suggesting a continuous distribution across this region, at least during the Last Glacial Maximum and the early Younger Dryas.Francisco Cuadrelli [f.cuadrelli@gmail.com]*,Juan Escamilla [juanitoesca@gmail.com] andAlfredo Zurita [aezurita74@yahoo.com], Laboratorio de Evolución de Vertebrados y Ambientes Cenozoicos–Centro de Ecología Aplicada del Litoral (CECOAL–CONICET) y Universidad Nacional del Nordeste, Corrientes, Argentina, 3400;David D.

    "abstract": "We describe a new stem group representative of the Phaethontiformes (tropicbirds) from the Paleocene Waipara Greensand in New Zealand. The fossil consists of a partial skeleton with a nearly complete skull and represents the first unambiguous record of the Phaethontiformes from the Paleocene of the Southern Hemisphere. Clymenoptilon novaezealandicum gen. et sp. nov. has a proportionally shorter pelvis than Prophaethon shrubsolei from the early Eocene London Clay and appears to have been less adapted to foraging in an aquatic environment at or below sea-level. It is furthermore distinguished from P. shrubsolei and Lithoptila abdounensis from the late Paleocene/early Eocene of Morocco in a proportionally smaller foramen magnum of the skull. Together with other plesiomorphic features, this suggests that C. novaezealandicum is the sister taxon of a clade including Lithoptila, Prophaethon and crown group Phaethontiformes, and as one of the oldest stem group phaethontiforms the new species may indicate a Southern Hemispheric centre of origin of tropicbirds. After a recently described bony-toothed bird, C. novaezealandicum is the second seabird species from the Waipara Greensand to show affinities to taxa from the early Paleogene of the Northern Hemisphere. The wide early Paleogene distribution of the Phaethontiformes stands in sharp contrast to the geographic restriction of coeval diving seabirds, and different factors appear to have limited the dispersal of aquatic and pelagic seabird taxa in the early Paleogene.Gerald Mayr [Gerald.Mayr@senckenberg.de], Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt, Ornithological Section, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Vanesa L.

    "abstract": "The Pleistocene fossil record of Australian raptors (Accipitridae: eagles, hawks and Old World vultures) is very poorly understood with only three distinct extinct species confirmed until now. The small Necrastur alacer remains unstudied; however recent research has established Cryptogyps lacertosus as a valid species that, along with the very large Dynatoaetus gaffae, has potential affinities with the Aegypiinae–Circaetinae clade. These, along with a single large living inland raptor, the Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax, suggest that Australia had an impoverished diversity of large raptors compared to other similar continental regions. However, fossil material similar in size to A. audax from multiple Pleistocene cave deposits raises the possibility of further taxa and is here assessed. A partial skeleton from Green Waterhole/Fossil Cave in the Tantanoola District of South Australia is referred to Cryptogyps lacertosus on the basis of similar size to bones of this species and that the associated coracoid is identical to that found with a tarsometatarsus that was previously referred to this species, coming from Leaena's Breath Cave on the Nullarbor Plain, Western Australia. This partial skeleton allowed additional material from the Old Collections, Wellington Caves, and Walli Caves in New South Wales to be referred to this species. A second species, more robust than A. audax, is identified from material from Victoria Fossil Cave at Naracoorte. Phylogenetic analyses determined this species to be the sister taxon of the much larger Dynatoaetus gaffae recently described from several Australian sites, and so we name it as Dynatoaetus pachyosteus sp. nov. Further fragmentary remains attributable to either A. audax, C. lacertosus or D. pachyosteus are recorded from sites in the Wellington Caves complex, NSW. This study increases the known diversity of raptors in Pleistocene Australia, consistent with the presence of the more diverse megafaunal prey that existed at the time.",

A new group and form, Wilunella glengarrica is proposed, and two new forms, Kussoidella karalundienis and Segosia finlaysoniensis are circumscribed. In addition, three other forms, represented only by poorly preserved specimens and as yet insufficiently known for formal taxonomic designation, are briefly described. The assemblage differs from that of the overlying Earaheedy Group, and can be used to distinguish basal Glengarry Group sequences from outliers of the lithologically similar basal Earaheedy Group. The Glengarry Group taxa have not been reported outside the Glengarry Basin, and are therefore of little use at present for inter-regional correlation. However, the ranges of the previously described groups Kussoidella and Segosia are consistent with the probable 1·8 Ga or older age of the Glengarry Group.",

    "abstract": "The Mt Lofty and Flinders Ranges of South Australia have been compared with classic Cambrian sections since the earliest records of European colonists in the 1830s. Fossils, although long expected, were not definitively described until the discoveries of a local school teacher, J.G.O. Tepper, at Ardrossan in 1878, supported by Ralph Tate at the newly established University of Adelaide. Tate also sent fossils to the British Museum and, following the relocation of R.L. Etheridge, to the Australian Museum in Sydney for description. As a consequence, the first trilobites and archaeocyaths were described from Ardrossan and the Flinders Ranges in 1884 and 1890, respectively. Walter Howchin found archaeocyaths in the Mount Lofty Ranges in 1896 and later supported a major monographic study of archaeocyaths by T.G. Taylor (1906-1910), which highlighted the famous Ajax Mine section for the first time. Howchin's fieldwork also established the complete stratigraphic succession of Cambrian strata in the Mt. Lofty/Flinders Ranges, work that was extended by Sir Douglas Mawson during the 1930s. At this time, R.W. Segnit also appreciated the importance of sections in the Mt. Scott Range and recognised the unconformity at the base of the Cambrian, while R. Bedford of Kyancutta was one of the world's leading experts on archaeocyaths. After World War II, systematic geological mapping of the Cambrian commenced initially under the guidance of R.C. Sprigg who discovered Cambrian trilobites on Kangaroo Island. Sprigg also targeted the Cambrian as a potential petroleum source. Brian Daily completed a doctoral degree on the Cambrian of South Australia in 1956 and focussed his subsequent research career on its study. Since the 1970s, his students have also made a significant contribution to Cambrian sedimentology and stratigraphy. Recent decades have seen a significant increase in Cambrian palaeontological research.",

    "abstract": "An ichnoassemblage of 10 ichnospecies is described for the first time from the Late Silurian Melbourne Formation at Studley Park, Victoria, southeastern Australia. The ichnofauna is preserved in a typical deep-water turbidite succession of alternating thin- to thick-bedded sandstone and thin- to medium-bedded mudrocks. Trace fossils observed within the study site have been assigned to three main ichnofacies. Ichnofacies 1 is best developed on the linguoid-rippled upper surface of thin sandstone beds and includes Laevicyclus, Aulichnites, Nereites, Helminthoidichnites, small Chondrites and possible Zoophycos. Ichnofacies 2 is very similar to Ichnofacies 1 in ichnospecies composition but instead contains large forms of Chondrites together with other thin burrow types usually poorly preserved and in very low abundance compared with Ichnofacies 1. Ichnofacies 3 is preserved mainly as casts on the underside of medium- to thick-bedded turbiditic sandstones, and has a very low diversity, with Planolites being the most common trace. A detailed analysis of the ichnofabrics and tiering structures of these ichnofacies suggest that Ichnofacies 1 and 3 represent ‘simple tiering’, in contrast to Ichnofacies 2, which is more characteristic of ‘complex tiering’. Despite the differences in ichnospecies composition and ichnofabrics between the three recognized ichnofacies, the collective ichnoassemblage from the study site can be assigned confidently to the Nereites ichnofacies and is, therefore, interpreted to have formed in a distal submarine fan environment of lower bathyal to abyssal depth. Further, it is possible to recognize two main subenvironments within this deep-sea setting to account for the differences between the ichnofacies. Ichnofacies 1 and 2 are interpreted to represent a typical Nereites ichnofacies located on a level basin floor subenvironment of relatively low energy conditions at the distal end of a submarine fan deposit. In comparison, Ichnofacies 3 is dominated by Planolites with rare other facies-crossing trace fossil forms, and lacks Nereites. It is, therefore, best interpreted as representing a relatively high-energy environment, possibly a distributary channel near the distal end of the submarine fan system.",

    "abstract": "The clade nominal Ophthalmosauridae encompasses all currently recognized ichthyosaurian taxa from the mid-Cretaceous (Albian–Cenomanian) time interval in North America. These would have inhabited what is today known as the Western Interior Seaway. The remains represent mid to large-sized (up to around 5 m in maximum body length) ichthyosaurians that are mainly based upon isolated teeth and vertebrae, although some partial skeletons have been recovered from both the USA and Canada. Most of these fossils have taxonomic affinities with platypterygiines, such as the ubiquitous 'form genus' Platypterygius. This taxon has historically been the default identification for most North American Cretaceous ichthyosaur specimens. However, in comparison with remains from elsewhere, the ichthyosaurian fossils from Texas have been relatively understudied. Here, I review the existing records and present a concise list of all Cretaceous ichthyosaurian material currently held in public museum collections across the state. I have recognized 11 Cretaceous ichthyosaurian occurrences from Texas, including an indeterminate tooth, numerous vertebral centra, and some fragmentary skeletal remains attributable to Platypterygius. Ichthyosaurians therefore demonstrably occupied the Cretaceous epeiric seas of Texas from at least the Albian to middle Cenomanian, a distribution that traverses both the western and eastern coastlines of the Western Interior Seaway during its early phase of southern epicontinental incursion.",

ISSN 0311–5518The genera of brachiopods of early Silurian (late Llandovery: Telychian) age have been critically reviewed and are listed from the major continental areas: South China, Avalonia-Baltica, Laurentia, Siberia and adjacent areas, and Gondwana (including the adjacent Kazakh terranes, Southwest Tien Shan and Iran). All those continents lay within tropical latitudes, apart from the South American sector of Gondwana, which hosted the Clarkeia Fauna, the earliest constituent of the largely high-latitude Devonian Malvinokaffric Province in the southern hemisphere. Additionally, the then northern (today’s southern) part of the Siberian continent, which included parts of Mongolia and North China, was at temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere so that it hosted the Tuvaella Fauna, which was also dominated by endemic brachiopod genera. Of the 202 genera listed, 50 are endemic to one of the six regions, and a further eight must have lived during Telychian times since they are known from both the underlying Aeronian and the overlying Sheinwoodian.L.

The fauna comprises Coreospira rugosa, Hampilina goniospira, Dorispira pacifica, cf. Igorella coreanica, and Helcionelloid indet. Coreospira and Hampilina are distinguished from other helcionelloids by their angular junction between dorsal and lateral surfaces, and from each other by the presence or absence of a rounded ridge along the junction, respectively. The Korean helcionelloids range stratigraphically from the base of Maochuangian to the lower Hsuchuangian using the chronostratigraphical scheme from North China; this correlates with upper Stage 4 to the lower Wuliuan Stage. Unusual septal features, such as complex suture lines in Hampilina and a central circular structure in the simple convex septa of Coreospira, occur in the apical region of the Korean helcionelloids, and could have implications for univalved molluscan evolution.Yeongju Oh [yjoh@kopri.re.kr], Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk 28644, Republic of Korea; Dong-Chan Lee [dclee@chungbuk.ac.kr], Department of Earth Science Education, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk 28644, Republic of Korea; Dong-Jin Lee [lichenaria@daum.net], College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun 130061, China; Jeong-Gu Lee [leejg0310@korea.kr] Gwacheon National Science Museum, Gwacheon 13817, Republic of Korea",

The comparatively high count of 24 dorsal vertebrae observed in aristonectine elasmosaurids, such as Aristonectes quiriquinensis, thus likely represents a derived state correlated with the acquisition of larger body size.José O'Gorman [joseogorman@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar] División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Paseo del Bosque s/n., B1900FWA La Plata; CONICET: Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Argentina, Godoy Cruz 2290, C1425FQB, CABA, Argentina; Franco Aspromonte [fran.aspromonte@gmail.com] División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Paseo del Bosque s/n., B1900FWA La Plata; Marcelo Reguero [mreguero@dna.gov.ar] División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Paseo del Bosque s/n., B1900FWA La Plata; Instituto Antártico Argentino, 25 de Mayo 1143, B1650HMK, San Martín, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",

It comprises two new species—Aglyptoderma elongatum gen. et sp. nov. and Aglyptoderma cylindratum gen. et sp. nov. The genus belongs to the family Semenoviolidae, hitherto known only from the Late Jurassic of Kazakhstan. However, owing to significant differences in the form of the head, pronotum, tegmina and tarsomeres, the new genus is classified within a separate subfamily, Aglyptodermatinae subfam. nov. The features of the new genus are discussed in the context of existing hypotheses regarding post-Jurassic character-state transitions in the postabdomen of female Dermaptera. In particular, reduction of the cerci and internalization of the ovipositor across Archidermaptera, Eodermaptera, and Neodermaptera may relate to the variety of maternal care behaviours seen among earwigs.Shurong Xiong [2190802066@mail.cnu.edu.cn], Lifang Xiao [xiaolifangjxau@163.com], Dong Ren* [rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn], College of Life Sciences and Academy for Multidisciplinary Studies, Capital Normal University, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Haidian District, Beijing 100048, PR China; Michael S.

The New Guinean diprotodontid ‘Kolopsis’ watutense (Anderson, 1937) is shown to be a diprotodontine based on the position of cristids and lower molar morphology. Examination of all known diprotodontine taxa has demonstrated that its original assignment to Nototherium is the most parsimonious and is, therefore, re-instated. However, the synonymy of the enigmatic Zygomaturus nimborensis and Nototherium watutense is re-affirmed. The reassignment of N. watutense to the Diprotodontinae and recognition of the late Miocene Pyramios alcootense as its closest relative is significant as it directly challenges the orthodoxy that the entire New Guinean diprotodontid radiation occurred solely within Zygomaturinae and suggests that the current understanding of New Guinea palaeozoogeography is probably more complex than first assumed. The recognition of N. watutense in the Pliocene Awe Local Fauna is also significant in the Australian context as Nototherium is currently only recognized from Pleistocene deposits suggesting perhaps a greater temporal span for the genus or that further intermediate forms remain to be discovered.",

ISSN 0311-5518Newly collected ammonoid material from the uppermost Cretaceous portion of the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation exposed some 30 km southeast of the Qasr Al'Harrana area (east-central Jordan) includes medium-sized baculitids (Baculites ovatus auctorum, non Say), the sphenodiscid Libycoceras acutodorsatus (Noetling) and the pachydiscids Menuites fresvillensis (Seunes) and Pachydiscus (Pachydiscus) dossantosi (Maury). Of the two last named taxa, the former is a good marker species for the upper Maastrichtian, with records from Europe, central Chile, South India, Baluchistan (Pakistan), Australia, Madagascar and South Africa. The latter is known from the United Arab Emirates/Oman border area, from strata of (late) early to early late Maastrichtian age, as well as from more poorly constrained Maastrichtian levels in Brazil and Nigeria. A comparison with ammonoid assemblages from the Maastrichtian type area (southeast Netherlands/northeast Belgium) suggests correlation of the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation with the middle/upper Maastricht Formation (Emael and Nekum members, ca 66.5–66.1 Ma) and the upper part of the coeval Kunrade Formation. However, associated 'tegulated' inoceramids of the Tenuipteria argentea group from the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation favour equivalence with a higher level of the Maastrichtian type area, i.e., the Meerssen Member. From the upper Maastricht Formation and the equivalent upper part of the Kunrade Formation, the following mosasaur genera are currently known: Mosasaurus, Prognathodon, Plioplatecarpus and Carinodens. Interestingly, coeval strata of the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation in east-central Jordan have yielded remains of a largely comparable suite comprising Prognathodon, Mosasaurus, Carinodens and an unnamed, highly derived plioplatecarpine.John W.M.

This paper revisits the femoral morphology of H. nehuensis and provides an updated osteological description together with new insights into its palaeobiology. Size estimates and a comparison of standardized measurements relative to Rhea americana demonstrate that H. nehuensis had an above-average body mass. The femoral dimensions of H. nehuensis were also proportionately greater than those of R. americana, but its reconstructed musculature is otherwise very similar. This suggests that H. nehuensis had powerful proximal muscles consistent with its enlarged size.

The inner platform is dry at low tide, apart from shallow pools containing Diloma aethiops and abundant but unexpected specimens of Zeacumantus subcarinatus and Cominella glandiformis exposed to the sun; all are common fossils in the terrace cover beds. The outer platform is carpeted densely with the alga Hormosira and shelters a diverse fauna, again all common fossils in the terrace cover beds. Sand and gravel containing shell fragments and supporting Zostera sea-grass turf unexpectedly covers ca 5% of the platform in low areas along the east coast. The fossil fauna is listed from 47 samples from two trenches excavated east–west and north–south through the terrace cover beds. Death assemblages of 158 molluscs, including 24 new records as fossils, and 11 taxa in other phyla delimit sediment derived from four shell accumulation sites identified around the present cape: storm beach, high-tidal strand line, hollows in the rock platform and Zostera flats. Up to 32 of the 47 samples (68%) possibly were deposited in Zostera flats; the rest were sand beach accumulations deposited at and near the high-tidal strand line. All fossils common in the cover beds lived on the rock platform. Differences between the deposits in the two trenches result from two factors. Protection along the east coast by protruding tephra beds and an outer rampart armoured with the macroalga Durvillaea prevented erosion of Zostera-supporting sediment which, therefore, was retained after each uplift event. The exposed eastern position of Table Cape also caused sediment to be transported predominantly westwards, onshore on the east coast but away from Table Cape along the north coast.A.G.

At the Mannum Pumping Station section, the Finniss Clay fauna has a low diversity, frequent shallow-water forms, and a poor taphonomic grade. In what was the deeper part of the basin at Waikerie, a diverse fauna with well-preserved small species is recorded in sediments equivalent to the Finniss Clay. In contrast, the Cadell Marl from various localities comprises a well-preserved and diverse biofacies with both shallow and deeper water taxa. These contrasts suggest different depositional environments: shallower and warm during deposition of the Finniss Clay and nutrient-rich, dysaerobic and deeper water during deposition of the Cadell Marl. The shallowing event indicated by faunas from the Finniss Clay was due to falling sea level close to the early/middle Miocene boundary, whereas the Cadell fauna appears to reflect the global carbon buildup at the peak of the Monterey carbon excursion during the Miocene climatic optimum, about 16 million years ago.

Cretaceous bryozoans are rare in Australasia, and the two species in this paper are the first to be formally described from New Zealand. Both species have thick dendroid colonies but whereas Ceriocava maculata sp. nov. is an unequivocal cerioporine cyclostome, the other species — Chiplonkarina campbelli sp. nov. — is more problematical and is interpreted as an aberrant 'malacostegan' cheilostome. Like previously described species of Chiplonkarina, C. campbelli has interzooidal walls with a central crenulated layer, indicating the former presence of an intercalary cuticle of the type found in many cheilostomes but unknown in cyclostomes. The anomalous global biogeographical distribution of bryozoans during the Cretaceous is briefly discussed.",

It is barren of ostracods. Cytherellid, krithiid, pontocypridid, paracypridid and trachyleberidid ostracods are abundant in the underlying Blanche Point Formation (BPF), whereas bairdiids, xestoleberidids, hemicytherids and loxoconchids are more abundant in the Port Willunga Formation (PWF) which overlies the Chinaman Gully Formation. A major contrast in trachyleberidid, loxoconchid and hemicytherid species composition is evident between the BPF and PWF. A bootstrap variety of correspondence analysis identified Paracypris, Kuiperiana, Krithe, Tasmanocypris?, Argilloecia, Trachyleberis, Cytherella and Bythocypris as significant genera (indicating a palaeodepth of 120–200 m) in the BPF and Quadracythere, Hornibrookella?, Loxoconcha, Microcytherura, bairdiids, Schizocythere, Cytheralison, Kangarina and Xestoleberis as significant genera (indicating a palaeodepth of ≤ 50 m) in the PWF. The generic diversity and the adult/juvenile ratio is higher in the PWF than in the BPF, reflecting a greater number of niches in a shallower environment with higher hydrodynamic stress. The many autochthonous cytherellids in the BPF probably signify low oxygen conditions during deposition. Four new species are proposed: Quadracythere willungaensis sp. nov., Quadracythere aldingaensis sp. nov., Quadracythere? sudaustralis sp. nov. and Loxoconcha ruwarungensis sp. nov.

Some of the common characteristics like the spinose proboscis, shared by other proboscis-bearing fossil worms in the Early and Middle Cambrian, suggest that the common ancestor for cycloneuralians had a zoned proboscis.

Accordingly, neither of the two species reviewed herein (Orthopteryx gigas and Ichtyopteryx gracilis) are represented by remains sufficiently complete to validate a new taxon. Orthopteryx gigas is based on an isolated synsacrum lacking diagnostic characters. Ichtyopteryx gracilis is based on a tarsometatarsus but with insufficient preservational quality to justify discrimination of the species. For these reasons both Orthopteryx gigas and Ichtyopteryx gracilis should be considered nomen dubia.",

Distinctive crinoid columnals from the Permian of Timor. Alcheringa 44, 56–63. ISSN 0311-5518Only one nominal species of the monobathrid camerate crinoid Camptocrinus Wachsmuth & Springer is known from the Permian of Timor, namely Camptocrinus indoaustralicus Wanner. The varied morphologies of disarticulated columnals may be due to variation within the xenomorphic column of this species, the presence of one or more additional species and/or the co-occurrence of the monobathrid Neocamptocrinus Willink. Herein, columnals are grouped into those with a strong elliptical shape; those with an inflated and oval outline; and those intermediate between these two extremes. A single specimen is encrusted by the auloporid tabulate coral Cladochonus? sp. Even separating Camptocrinus and Neocamptocrinus on the basis of more complete specimens is problematic. Neocamptocrinus is defined by its numerous small plates in an extended tegmen, which is commonly lost or concealed. Both Camptocrinus and Neocamptocrinus have three small anals in the base of the tegmen immediately above the large single primanal in the radial circlet. The column tapered to a distal point in both genera and was anchored to the substrate by a radicular runner. It may be that the two genera are one, but, if not, Neocamptocrinus is strictly Permian and limited to Tethys.Debbie I.E.

One, recovered from Australia (Aranbanga Volcanic Group), belongs to Mesophlebia antinodalis Tillyard, 1916, previously documented on the basis of two very incomplete wings. The other, recovered from South Africa (Molteno Formation), is assigned to a new species, Mesophlebia elegans sp. nov. The new data allow a reconsideration of the diagnosis of the genus Mesophlebia Tillyard, 1916 and a re-instatement of the family Mesophlebiidae Tillyard, 1916. Notably, the new specimens possess, near the wing base, a posterior lobe absent in most ‘triassolestid’ genera, but present in crown-Odonata and a number of their stem-relatives. Lobodonata tax. nov. is erected to accommodate odonates possessing this lobe. The nature of the ‘vein-like’ element anteriorly delimiting this lobe is discussed.

This specimen displays a unique character state combination including three symphyseal alveoli, the angle between the mandibular rami exceeding 90°, and the absence of a ventral symphyseal sulcus or keel. This mandibular configuration has not been observed previously among elasmosaurids, prompting comparisons with other described examples and suggesting that mandibular morphology reached a variability peak during the Maastrichtian, which might be reflective of increased trophic diversity.José Patricio O'Gorman [joseogorman@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar], Paula Bona [paulabona26@gmail.com], División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Paseo del Bosque s/n., B1900FWA, La Plata, Argentina; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas), Godoy Cruz 2290, C1425FQB, CABA, Argentina.

Fifteen brachiopod species in 12 genera are described for the first time from four intervals in the middle and upper parts of the Zhanpo Formation at the Huoyanxi section near Zhenba in the western Daba Mountains, southern Shaanxi, central China. The Zhenba brachiopod fauna is dominated by diverse and abundant species of Productida, together with some species of Athyridida, Orthida, Orthotetida and Spiriferida. It ranges from late Viséan to Serpukhovian in age based on the presence of Gigantoproductus species in association with diagnostic foraminifera and conodonts. This fauna generally shows palaeobiogeographical links with the palaeoequatorial realm, including Western Europe, the Moscow Basin, the Ural Mountains, Japan, eastern Tibet and South and North China. Its closest palaeobiogeographical affinity is with South China assemblages rather than those of North and Northwest China, therefore, indicating that the Zhenba area was palaeogeographically close to the South China Block and relatively far from the blocks in Northwest China (e.g., the Qilian Mountains and Qaidam Basin, Kunlun Mountains, Tarim Basin and Tianshan Mountains) during the late Viséan–Serpukhovian.",

Fossil land snails from the Antilles are known mainly from cave deposits. Hitherto, only one late Pleistocene site in Jamaica has yielded parautochthonous land snails that were not trapped in a cave. The second, in conglomeratic, alluvial red beds at Farquhar's Beach, parish of Clarendon, has produced numerous specimens and a greater diversity of species. These include Alcadia (Alcadia) citrinolabris (C.B. Adams), Lucidella (Perenna) yallahsensis (Pilsbry & Brown), Poteria sp., Adamsiella (Adamsiella) sp., Annularia (Annularia) mitis (Pfeiffer), Parachondria (Parachondrella) crenulosa (C.B.

These nine genera are common components of coeval cave deposits on the island. Jamaica is a biodiversity hot spot for extant land snails, yet they are only common as fossils in the late Pleistocene (<100 000 years) despite the fact that most of the island has been subaerially exposed since the end of the middle Miocene.",

Thirty species assigned to 17 genera were recovered from decimetre-scale limestone beds in a fine-grained siliciclastic succession, deposited in an intraplate rift system. The following biozones are established for the region, in ascending order: Proconodontus muelleri, Eoconodontus, Cordylodus intermedius, Cordylodus lindstromi, Cordylodus angulatus, Paltodus deltifer and Acodus triangularis interval zone. This low-to medium-richness conodont fauna comprises cosmopolitan euconodont species of Proconodontus, Eoconodontus, Cordylodus, Teridontus nakamurai, Semiacontiodus nogamii and a few long- ranging proto- and paraconodont species, which inhabited a narrow marine basin flanked by landmasses and formed by active rifting. It lacks shallow water tropical taxa and probably belongs to the Cold Domain of the Shallow Sea Realm. The occurrence of conodonts of the Paltodus deltifer Biozone in the uppermost part of the Qyzlar Formation in the Ghelli section suggests that the major episode of flood basalt volcanism in south Kopet-Dagh commenced in the late Tremadocian.",

Hitherto there has been little emphasis on the palaeoecological and palaeogeographic distribution of Shamovella, although this could provide further information relating to its systematic position. Previous reports of Shamovella document occurrence in shallow-marine warm water, often reefal, associations. However, in the Late Sakmarian (Sterlitamakian) Hoeniti Member of the Maubisse Formation near Bisnain, eastern West Timor, Shamovella obscura (Maslov) Riding is locally abundant and is associated with brachiopods of temperate water affinity. Shamovella obscura occurs in grainstones with abraded and bored bioclasts, indicating shallow-water, but dasycladaleans, other calcareous algae, and also cyanobacteria are absent. This indicates that Shamovella could occupy temperate, in addition to tropical, marine environments and suggests affinities were unlikely to have been with calcified cyanobacterium or chlorophyte alga, or a consortium involving these, but is consistent with an invertebrate affinity.",

Topotypes of these genera, however, have yet to be studied using SEM techniques, and their morphologic details remain uncertain. The organic composition of the present microfossils is supported by energy-dispersive X-ray analyses.

Rare specimens of both Bairdoppilata species exhibit reduced development of auxiliary dentition. This is correlated with other intraspecific morphological variations. These variations are gradational and therefore are interpreted as being mainly of an ecophenotypic nature. There is a shift from a high species abundance and diversity in the late Early to early Middle Miocene limestones, marls and clays of the Fyansford Formation to a low abundance and diversity in the sandy 'eastern facies' of the Sherwood Formation. This reduction is attributed to a combination of locally unfavourable depth-related conditions and a marginally cooler climatic regime. The latter possibly indicates a slightly younger age for the upper sequences of the 'eastern facies' of the Sherwood Formation (late Middle or early Late Miocene) correlating with the known post-early Middle Miocene cooling in southeastern Australia.",

Numerous brachiopods have been recorded from the succession, but there are no published descriptions of protorthides or orthides. In this paper nine species are described, of which two (Skenidioides thrinax and Salopina mediocostata) were originally described from the late Wenlock of Canberra, while five are new: Dolerorthis exatripalude, Isorthis (Arcualla) salicipontis, Salopina pusilla, S. rainbowella, and Talentella yassensis. Only the two Canberra species and D. exatripalude occur in Gorstian levels below the Black Bog Shale. All except one species occur in the lower Ludfordian Black Bog Shale, S. rainbowella being restricted to the overlying upper Ludfordian Rainbow Hill Member (basal Rosebank Shale) which also contains very rare S. mediocostata. Both S. pusilla and T. yassensis extend to the lower Prídolí lower Cowridge Siltstone. T. yassensis is the oldest species of that genus so far recorded, and might be derived from S. mediocostata. The Lochkovian species Salopina? herkion (Garra Formation, central NSW) is here referred to Talentella.

Kaufmannia is renamed Kaufmannella nom. nov. The cranidium of K. lauta has a strong glabellar spine preserved and the free cheek is described for the first time. Representatives of the Suborder Asaphina and the Superfamily Ceratopygacea are separated from the Redlichiida and placed in an independent order, the Asaphida. New specimens of cranidia of Lichakephalus erbeni reveal that an earlier interpretation of the glabellar furrows is in error. The furrows are now interpreted in agreement with Öpik (1937) as having a similar arrangement to Platylichas. Lichakephalus is closely related to the Lichidae as well as to the Cambrian Eoacidaspididae, and homology of the glabellar lobes suggests that the three typical pairs of lobes including the ‘occipital lobes’ (named here L1a-c) correspond together to the basal lateral glabellar lobe (L1). If it is true that the Eoacidaspididae are closely related to the Odontopleurida as well, then these and the Lichida should be united in one order.",

Early forms of Palmatodella (here used to include all apparatuses with a palmatolepan P element) possess a similar lippertiform N element, a palmatodellan O element, and a symmetry transition series clearly derived from that of Mesotaxis.

The brachiopod affinities of the Precordillera are compared with the biogeographical Late Palaeozoic regions previously suggested by other authors using cluster analysis. During the Bashkirian-Moscovian, the Precordilleran faunas show a high affinity with the Austral Realm because of the presence of the Levipustula faunal elements in Eastern Australia. At the same time the affinity with the central and North American Regions is very low. The Early Permian Precordilleran faunas demonstrate highest affinity with the Gondwanan Realm with several genera also linked to the Tethyan and Boreal Realms. After the Late Carboniferous glacial episodes that affected the southwestern Gondwanan margin, the Precordilleran region underwent climatic amelioration. Subsequently, the Early Permian Precordilleran brachiopod assemblages are characterized by typical cool to cold water genera widely developed in the core Gondwanan Realm, with fewer genera (such as Kochiproductus, Rhynchopora and Neochonetes) suggesting a warmer water influence. The Precordilleran faunas demonstrate an increase in brachiopod diversity from the Carboniferous to the Permian, related to water temperature changes and to the palaeogeographical evolution of the southwestern Gondwanan margin and the movement of Gondwana across the South Pole.",

The pachastrellid genus Brachiaster Wilson (Pachastrellidae, Demospongiae, Porifera) has had until now no known fossil representatives. Here we describe its first known fossil representative from the late Eocene of southwestern Western Australia, assigned to Brachiaster claudelevii sp. nov. Brachiaster claudelevii has well-developed axial canals in the mesotriders, which points to it being intermediate in character between the typical tetraxial desmas of lithistids, and tetraxial spicules of non-lithistid demosponges. This further supports the position of Brachiaster among the Pachastrellidae. The geographic and bathymetric distribution of the extant and newly described fossil representatives of Brachiaster indicates that the Eocene sponge described here is important in understanding the evolution of Indo-West Pacific sponges because it points to a long evolutionary history and complex biogeographic distribution of this lineage of pachastrellid sponges.

A possible early age for a diprotodon (Marsupialia: Diprotodontidae) fossil from the Papua New Guinea highlands. Alcheringa 32, 129–147. ISSN 0311-5518. A fossil diprotodon jawbone coated and impregnated with a well-cemented fine breccia or tuff was recovered from weakly consolidated Pleistocene lacustrine sediments near Yonki in the Papua New Guinea highlands. The fine breccia includes angular rock and mineral fragments derived from country rock, accretionary lapilli and clay minerals. It does not include any identifiable primary volcanic material. The presence of accretionary lapilli and lack of volcanic clasts suggests an origin by phreatic eruption—an explosive eruption driven by the violent escape of gas. Minerals in the fine breccia have an age of 13.2 ± 0.2 Ma, middle Miocene, as indicated by 40Ar/39Ar analysis. This is the age of the country rock that was blasted by the phreatic eruption. Igneous activity in the Yonki area is thought to have ceased at 7.4 Ma (younger age limit of Elandora Porphyry; late Miocene), and so it is likely, but not certain, that the phreatic eruption occurred not later than 7.4 Ma. The jawbone, as far as can be told from its poor condition, is dentally similar to the late Pliocene and possibly Pleistocene 'Kolopsis' watutense recovered from other sites in New Guinea. Probably, the jawbone, or the living marsupial, was buried in the fine breccia at the time of the phreatic eruption, and its remains were subsequently reworked by river erosion and redeposited in the lacustrine sediments. Recrystallization and loss of primary texture in some of the bone may be a result of heating at the time of, or preceding, the eruption.

Thousands of variously silicified bioclasts etched from this section are the basis of this study. The echinoderms Cymbionites Whitehouse, 1941 and Peridionites Whitehouse, 1941 are shown to be basal circlets of stalkless, multicirclet, epispire- and brachiole-bearing eocrinoids. These two genera appear most closely related to Lichenoides Barrande from the Czech Republic. A stalked eocrinoid, Thorntonites dowlingi gen. et sp. nov., and an edrioblastoid, Ikerus edgari gen. et sp. nov., occur with Peridionites higher in the section than Cymbionites. Thorntonites has a multimeric stalk and fused conical holdfast, at least three circlets of thecal plates with fewer and coarser epispires, and larger brachioles around the summit. Ikerus has a multimeric stalk, three circlets of thecal plates and straight ambulacral grooves, without connection to the thecal interior, traversing the central axis of thecal plates. These three eocrinoids and the edrioblastoid occur in shallow-water carbonates as abundant, low-to-medium tier, suspension feeders associated with brachiopods, molluscs, hyoliths, sponges, edrioasteroids and trilobites. This associated fauna includes Xystridura cf. negrina, Xingrenaspis cf. tongshanensis, Diraphora dyunyin, Westonia nyapungensis, Latouchella accordionata and Guduguwan hardmani, which collectively allow correlation with the Xystridura negrina assemblage.*Peter A.

Here, we describe a new species, Loricera groehni sp. nov., belonging to Loricera based on a well-preserved adult in Eocene Baltic amber. Loricera groehni is tentatively attributed to the obsoleta group of the subgenus Loricera s.str. based on the relatively long antennomere 3 and punctate elytral interval 7. The discovery of a new species morphologically close to the extant Loricera species from western China and northern India suggests that the obsoleta group was more widespread in the Eocene than it is at present. The distribution pattern of Chinese Loricera is probably relictual. The fossil species, possessing conspicuous stiff setae on the basal antennomeres, was probably a specialized predator of springtails.Chenyang Cai [cycai@nigpas.ac.cn], Key Laboratory of Economic Stratigraphy and Palaeogeography, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Ye Liu [liuye198282@126.com], Key Laboratory of Zoological Systematics and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China; Diying Huang [dyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China.",

Mid-Cenozoic ostracod biostratigraphic range extensions and taxonomic notes on selected species from a new Oligocene (Duntroonian–Waitakian) fauna from southern New Zealand. Alcheringa 41, 487–498.This paper discusses a highly diverse assemblage of Ostracoda, particularly biostratigraphically useful species, from a richly fossiliferous shallow-marine deposit of late Oligocene age on Cosy Dell farm, near Waimumu, Southland, New Zealand. The ostracod fauna, consisting of 126 species, is yet to be fully analysed, although it is clear that this new window into the nearshore fauna of the mid-Cenozoic provides the earliest records of many characteristic extant New Zealand genera and species, including several species hitherto only known as far back as the early Miocene (Otaian–Altonian New Zealand local Stages). Finding these younger species in an Oligocene deposit was unexpected and indicates that our current knowledge of mid-Cenozoic ostracod age ranges, particularly for nearshore species, is incomplete. Using nannofossils and molluscs, the Cosy Dell deposit is dated as late Oligocene (Duntroonian or lower Waitakian local Stages) in age; therefore, the new ostracod species occurrences described here are considered valid range extensions. Although the biostratigraphic application of the benthonic ostracod species discussed is limited owing to the effects of sedimentary facies and other palaeoenvironmental factors, the ostracod fossil record does include significant extinction and inception events that offer correlative potential for mid-Cenozoic stratigraphical studies. This study identified a need for modern illustration of many species, and we provide scanning electron microscope illustrations of those Cosy Dell taxa previously considered biostratigraphically useful, as support for species identification and associated biostratigraphic conclusions.Michael Ayress [mike.ayress@rpsgroup.com], RPS ichron Group, Gadbrook Business Centre, Northwich CW9 7TN, UK; Jeffrey Robinson [jeffreyhrobinson@yahoo.co.nz] and Daphne Lee [daphne.lee@otago.ac.nz], Geology Department, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",

Alcheringa 42, 259–268. ISSN 0311-5518.The ‘tuning-fork’ didymograptid previously referred to as Didymograpt(ell)us protobifidus is common in Victoria where it is confined to the Chewtonian (mid-Floian). Biometric differences indicate that the mid-Floian form is not conspecific with the holotype of the Darriwilian Didymograptus protobifidus Elles, 1933 and the Floian form is thus renamed Didymograptellus kremastus n. sp. Study of the Valhallfonna Formation faunas on Spitsbergen indicated that the Floian form of D. ‘protobifidus’ differs from Didymograptellus bifidus (Hall) in both its morphology and stratigraphic distribution but a later study of the Cow Head Group on Newfoundland concluded that they are one species. My study, of more than 50 specimens of Didymograptellus from the Floian of Victoria, Australia, shows that the two are different and that similar differences exist in the Cow Head Group populations of Didymograptellus.

Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Livingston Island, Antarctic Peninsula in the Early Cretaceous: interpretations from the Walker Bay erratics. Alcheringa 39, 000–000. ISSN 0311-551Fossiliferous, volcaniclastic sandstone erratics, containing abundant plant fragments, palynomorphs and a possible insect wing, were extracted from the previously unstudied Walker Bay moraine, Livingston Island (ca 62°36ʹS, 60°42ʹW). These samples provide new insights into high southern latitude ecosystems of the South Shetland Islands region during the Early Cretaceous greenhouse interval. The palynofloral assemblage, in particular the co-occurrence of Ischyosporites punctatus, Concavissimisporites penolaensis and Reticulatisporites pudens, suggests that deposition could have occurred between the early Aptian and mid-Albian (ca 125–109 Ma), but was most likely early to mid-Albian (ca 112–109 Ma). The high relative abundance of the pteridophyte taxon, Cyathidites and associated fungal disaster taxa, together with significant quantities of volcaniclastic material, indicates a volcanically perturbed post-eruption riparian environment. Petrologic evidence suggests that the volcanic sediments were deposited rapidly in the above-mentioned fluvial setting. Comparisons to geological studies conducted on Livingston Island reveal an affinity of the Walker Bay erratics to the Byers Group; the unique palynofloral assemblage and petrological features of the erratics suggesting that the volcanogenic lithic sandstone facies may represent a previously undescribed unit of the upper Cerro Negro Formation.Kevin Chen [kevin.chen@monash.edu], Jeffrey D.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe first Miocene records of silicified fossil woods from the Mariño Formation, Potrerillos area, Andes Precordillera, Mendoza province, Argentina are described. Rhaphithamnoxylon artabeae gen. et sp. nov. is described as the first fossil wood referable to Verbenaceae from Argentina. This new fossil species is related to extant Rhaphithamnus Miers, sharing the following anatomical features: diffuse porosity, distinct growth ring boundaries, numerous small to very small vessels, commonly in radial multiples, 1–3 seriate rays, and heterocellular and scarce paratracheal axial parenchyma. Rhaphithamnus contains only two extant species: R. spinosus (A.L. Juss.) Moldenke, which occurs in the Valdivian forests of Chile and Argentina, and R. venustus (Philippi) Robinson, which is endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands. Representatives of Verbenaceae are distributed predominantly in the Americas from Patagonia (Argentina) to Canada, and they are inferred to have originated in South America. The fossil wood described herein provides new age and geographical constraints on the raphithanoid lineage within Verbenaceae. Other fossil woods recorded from the Mariño level are retained under open nomenclature, as they possess a combination of mostly solitary broad vessels, and smaller vessels in radial multiples or in clusters, with numerous, vasicentric to confluent axial parenchyma, and heterocellular, high rays. Thus, they have features akin to dicotyledonous lianas or vine-like or small shrub species.从阿根廷门多萨省安第斯山脉Precordillera的Potrerillos地区的马里诺组中首次发现的中新世硅化木化石记录在此得以描述。新属新种 Rhaphithamnoxylon artabeae gen. et sp. nov被描述为可归属于阿根廷马鞭草的木化石。这种新的化石种与现生Rhaphithamnus Miers有关系，两者共享以下的解剖特点：弥漫性孔隙度、明显的年轮界线、许多小到非常小的导管（通常呈径向倍数及1-3轮射线）和异型细胞和稀有气管轴向薄壁组织。 Rhaphithamnus只有两个现生物种：出现在智利和阿根廷的Valdivian森林的R. spinosus (A. L. Juss.)Moldenke，以及R. venustus（Philippi）Robinson，这是Juan Fernandez群岛的土著种。马鞭草科的代表主要分布在美洲，从巴塔哥尼亚（阿根廷）到加拿大，因此推测它们起源于南美洲。在此所描述的木化石提供了新的时代资料和马鞭草科内的raphithanoid类群的地域限制。从马利诺层位记录的其它木化石有待命名，因为它们大多具有孤宽导管和径向成倍或成簇的较小导管的综合特征，有许多脉管中心的至汇合的轴向薄壁组织，和异型细胞的高射线。因此，他们的特点类似于双子叶藤本植物或藤状或小灌木物种。Key words: Fossil woodsMariño FormationMioceneVerbenaceaeLianas or small shrubsArgentina AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to the authorities of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales y Antropológicas ‘Juan Cornelio Moyano’ of Mendoza city, Argentina, for granting access to the collections and for having generously arranged the loan of the fossil material.

    "abstract": "Large-scale molecular datasets have generally outperformed morphological data for inferring phylogeny, and sources of error in the latter are poorly understood. The morphologically and ecologically diverse marsupial order Diprotodontia (kangaroos and their relatives, the koala, wombats and possums) is well suited to considering these issues. Recent molecular results provide a phylogenetic benchmark for comparing previous molecular and morphological studies, encompassing all of the major phylogenetic data sources and methods that have been employed over the past 50 years. We show here that most molecular methodologies and ‘informal-comparative’ morphological studies have inferred diprotodontian relationships that closely resemble the recent molecular consensus. However, and perhaps surprisingly, algorithmic morphology, such as maximum parsimony analysis of morphological matrices, has inferred markedly inaccurate phylogenies, and is not improved by re-analysis with more recently developed, model-based (e.g., likelihood and Bayesian) methods. This is particularly concerning because algorithmic morphology is the primary approach for integrating fossils into the tree of life, and hence, for both calibrating molecular timescales and extending phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary processes beyond the snapshot provided by modern species. A novel simulation study presented here suggests that the inaccuracies in the marsupial algorithmic morphology studies partly stem from functional and body-size correlations among taxa that over-ride phylogenetic signals. We use the results to trial a reverse engineered phylogeny approach to correcting for such functional and developmental correlations among morphological data. In addition, we interrogated a newly published, densely taxon-sampled morphological matrix. Deeper level phylogeny reconstruction was improved by including fossils alongside extant taxa and counterintuitively, by increased effort to resolve relationships among shallow taxa.Matthew J.

    "abstract": "Four new fossil feathertail possum species (Marsupialia, Diprotodontia, Phalangerida, Petauroidea, Acrobatidae) are described from late Oligocene to middle Miocene fossil deposits in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland. They are the first pre-Pleistocene fossil representatives of this family to be described. Two species are referred to the modern genus Acrobates and two to the modern genus Distoechurus. These species are distinguished from each other and from the living Distoechurus pennatus and Acrobates pygmaeus on the basis of qualitative and quantitative characters of the first lower molar (m1), which is the only tooth known for all four fossil species. Fortunately, m1 is morphologically the most variable tooth in the cheektooth row of acrobatids, and it exhibits numerous genus- and species-specific features. Phylogenetic analyses based on dental characters strongly support monophyly of Acrobatidae relative to other petauroids, as well as providing relatively strong support for reciprocal monophyly of Acrobates and Distoechurus, including the newly described fossil members of these genera. Recognition of species of Acrobates and Distoechurus in these fossil deposits is broadly congruent with recent estimates for the time of divergence of the two modern genera based on molecular data, and also provides an additional fossil calibration point for future studies of marsupial divergence times. These fossil species provide new insights into the biogeographical and ecological history of this enigmatic family of small possums, specifically that the oldest known species of Acrobates occurred in closed forest environments (in contrast to the living species, A. pygmaeus and Acrobates frontalis, which today inhabit open sclerophyll forests and woodlands) and that Distoechurus appears to have originated in Australia, only subsequently dispersing to New Guinea before becoming extinct in its Australian homeland.Prudence R.

Two patterns of muscle scars are recognized in helcionelloids. In the Hensoniconus–Vendrascospira group, two pairs of sub-equally sized scars are located on the dorso-lateral surfaces. In the Bemella–Figurina group, thin, band-like scars are distributed on the sub-apical surface and along the dorsal (supra-apical) surface. Comparison of these rare described occurrences of muscle scars in bilaterally symmetrical molluscs indicates that the simple shell form may obscure recognition of distinct lineages within Cambrian univalves that are based on anatomical features, such as musculature.John S.

Living species employ acrobatic foraging methods, using the flexible leg to probe hollows and recesses. It is considered that P. robertbolesi used similar foraging techniques.

These calcareous structures are interpreted to have been constructed by the larval stage of the weevil Leptopius duponti, for protection during pupation.

The spiralia, unlike those of other known spire bearers, are not united with the crura. A complete series of growth stages down to specimens 1.5 mm long has been recovered. Consideration of the mode of deposition of the spires and the jugum leads to the conclusion that growth took place in the normal way for spiriferoids and not by the method proposed by Samtleben. The jugum and jugal process were formed from an epithelium extending in from both valves, and there is no evidence that it bore the growing points of the lophophore. The spiralia occupied almost the whole of the mantle cavity when the shell was shut, but the lack of a junction between the crus and the spiralium permitted the epithelium from the two valves to hold the spires away from the valves when the shell opened, thus allowing room for the lophophore filaments to function. A double lophophore is inferred from data on the shape and spacing of the spiral lamellae, and the filaments are considered to have functioned in a tip-to-tip fashion. The spires were of inhalant type, the incurrents being lateral and the excurrents medial. There is no strong evidence to support the concept of a relationship between the Anoplothecidae and Dayia or Cyclospira, and the Dayiacea as at present understood is rejected. It is possible that spire bearers with single and double lophophores evolved independently at about the same time in the Late Ordovician.",

    "abstract": "Palaeozoogeographical provincialism in the Ordovician Period is well portrayed by brachiopod, conodont, graptolite and trilobite faunas. The provinces defined for each taxonomic group show a remarkable degree of correspondence in geographical extent and temporal expression, so much so as to suggest the operation of a common causal mechanism. A convincing body of evidence is available in support of the view that latitudinal variation in surface water temperature was primarily responsible for the provincialism displayed by the epipelagic graptolites. In the partially or exclusively benthic brachiopods, conodonts and trilobites, however, the primary temperature effect is masked, in varying degrees, by secondary factors, which may have included the influence of the seabed environment, geographical separation (isolation) of coeval faunas, and physical barriers to migration.",

Study of several specimens, chiefly from the Silurian of Gotland, reveals that the two genera exhibit markedly different patterns of lateral and interstitial increase. In lateral increase of Cystihalysites, corallites and intercorallite dissepimental tissue develop alternately along the base of a new rank. On the other hand, the corallites of Halysites occur along the bottom of the new rank with intercorallite tubules inserted above the base. In interstitial increase of Cystihalysites the intercorallite tissue is vertically continuous, bifurcating to either side of the newly-formed corallite. In contrast, there is a gap in the vertical continuity of intercorallite tissue in Halysites. A tubule is replaced by a new corallite; then at a higher level, two new tubules become inserted to either side of the new corallite. Differing interpretations of the manner of development of both lateral and interstitial increase in Halysites depend on whether the polyps originally lived in shallow or deep calices.",

U-Th ages as well as macroscopic examination show two distinct growth phases separated by a period of speleothem dissolution (earlier phase of 179-162 ka and later phase of 114–96 ka). Sampling traverses along growth lamellae indicate significant isotopic differences between the centre and distal part of the lamellae (disequilibrium due to CO2 degassing). Carbon and oxygen isotopic data from the earlier growth phase (down axis of speleothem core) show pronounced co-variation, albeit with greater variation of carbon values. Comparisons of speleothem isotopic values with global isotopic records show reasonable correspondence to SPECMAP trends. An enhanced δ18O signal in the speleothem could be due to ocean water and soil hydrology signals combining colder, enriched ocean water and a drier, enriched soil signature, compared with warmer, depleted ocean water and a wetter, depleted soil signature. Carbon isotopes largely co-vary with oxygen; enriched carbon values probably reflect low soil activity during drier, cooler times and depleted carbon values probably reflect a soil carbon signature dominated by C3 vegetation.",

[Google Scholar] collected from the San Juan Formation (Darriwilian, Middle Ordovician) of the Argentine Precordillera is described and illustrated, allowing a better understanding of its functional morphology. Inversella (Reinversella) is one of the earliest known brachiopods to develop a geniculate shell. Adult specimens of I. (R.) arancibiai have an open delthyrium indicating attachment throughout life. We infer that juvenile specimens lacking geniculation lived umbo-down and that development of geniculation could reflect a progressive change in mode of life from erect to reclined. The posterior thickening of valves indicates a life position with the umbonal region sunk in the substrate and the trail orientated in a subvertical position. Since open shelf settings inhabited by I. (R.) arancibiai have low sedimentation rates, it seems improbable that geniculation was an adaptation to counter shell burial. Its function was most probably to separate exhalant and inhalant currents. We hypothesize that the deep channel developed along the periphery of the ventral valve functioned as a collector of waste waters towards the posterolateral regions of the shell where exhalant currents were expelled.",

Alcheringa 43, 71–84.A comparison of 29 identifiable vascular plant species in litter beneath Eucalyptus woodland with at least 74 species living nearby showed that the litter is a poor representation of standing vegetation. The leaf litter is dominated by sclerophyll leaves, which are a factor of 6.2 over-represented in litter for Angophora costata, factor of 5.7 for Melaleuca linariifolia, of 3.6 for Eucalyptus spp., of 3.5 for Pteridium esculentum and of 2.1 for Acacia linifolia. Angophora leaves are favored by lignification, with denser venation than Eucalyptus leaves. Sparse emergent oil glands of Angophora also provide fewer entry points for bacteria than rotted internal oil glands of Eucalyptus. The myrtaceous taxa Angophora, Eucalyptus, Melaleuca and Kunzea all have oils dominantly of preservative terpene. Melaleuca linariifolia and Acacia linifolia also have leaves and phyllodes (respectively) that are narrow with a thick lignin midrib. Thickly cuticled, succulent, hirsute, pubescent, and pinnate leaves, and green stems are not favored for preservation, because they rot from the inside out. Conspicuously absent in the leaf litter are nonsclerophyll leaves, most grasses and low herbs. This modern sclerophyll leaf litter matches Sydney Basin Permian and Triassic fossil plant localities above nutrient-poor siliceous paleosols, which may have had much more diversity than the preserved fossil flora. Clayey calcareous paleosol leaf litters and lake deposits may record a truer record of local floristic diversity in deep time than sclerophyll leaf litters.Gregory J.

These features may have influenced stance and gait in moa compared with extant birds. One means of assessing locomotor biomechanics, particularly for extinct species, is quantitative analysis of the architecture of cancellous bone, since this architecture is adapted to suit its mechanical environment with high sensitivity. This study investigated the three-dimensional architecture of cancellous bone in the femur, tibiotarsus and fibula of three moa species: Dinornis robustus, Pachyornis elephantopus and Megalapteryx didinus. Using computed tomographic X-ray scanning and previously developed fabric analysis techniques, the spatial variation in cancellous bone fabric patterns in moa was found to be largely comparable with that previously reported for extant birds, particularly large species. Moa hence likely used postures and kinematics similar to those employed by large extant bird species, but this interpretation is tentative on account of relatively small sample sizes. A point of major difference between moa and extant birds concerns the diaphyses; cancellous bone invades the medullary cavity in both groups, but the invasion is far more extensive in moa. Combined with previous assessments of cortical geometry, this further paints a picture of at least some moa species possessing very robust limb bones, for which a convincing explanation remains to be determined",

Alcheringa 36, 413–426. ISSN 0311-5518. Taxonomic diversity structure indicates how higher-rank taxa influence the diversity of lower-rank taxa. Brachiopods experienced significant changes in the superfamily–family, superfamily–genus and family–genus components of diversity structure during the Phanerozoic. The most intense changes occurred at the Cambrian–Ordovician, Devonian–Carboniferous and Permian–Triassic transitions, when new higher-rank taxa began to determine the diversity at lower taxonomic levels. In contrast, the similarity of successive brachiopod assemblages was relatively high during the Ordovician–Devonian, Carboniferous–Permian, Triassic–Cretaceous and Paleogene–Quaternary intervals indicating a form of evolutionary stagnation. High dissimilarity between older and younger assemblages was established at the Cambrian–Ordovician and Permian–Triassic transitions, which mark the distinctions between the Cambrian, Palaeozoic and Modern evolutionary faunas within the target fossil group, i.e., brachiopods. Changes in superfamily–family, superfamily–genus and family–genus components of diversity structure were similar. All 'Big Five' mass extinctions left a more or less significant imprint in the dynamics of the diversity structure of brachiopods, but the Late Devonian and end-Permian catastrophes were especially important. Results of the present study may be refined with future improvements to brachiopod suprageneric systematics.

A probable sixth species is recorded from Cenomanian deposits of Bathurst Island, but the affinity of this taxon is uncertain. In some shell beds of the Allaru Formation, scaphopods dominate the preserved macrobenthos. Although at species level the fauna is endemic, strongly cosmopolitan genus level links of the scaphopods mirror that of other groups of molluscs (bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods), indicating derivation from evolutionary separation from pre-existing widespread Mesozoic stocks which experienced gradual range restriction during the late Mesozoic.

The scope of the chilidiopsine genus Morinorhynchus is discussed. Two species, Leptaena compitalis and P. (Plectodonta) psygmata, are new. Three species, Desistrophia papilio, Epelidoaegiria minuta chilidifera and Morinorhynchus oepiki, were originally described from the late Wenlock to early Ludlow of Canberra. Leptaena compitalis is also recorded from the Ludlow of Molong in central N.S.W. The 17 species originally assigned to Stropheodonta by Mitchell are fully revised; two are unusable, the others are now reduced to four: M. (Mesoleptostrophia) quadrata, Mesopholidostrophia bendeninensis, Epelidoaegiria minuta minuta, and P. (Plectodonta) bipartita. The greatest species diversity is in the lower Ludfordian Black Bog Shale; none of the species originally described from Canberra extends above that level. The fauna of the upper Ludfordian Rainbow Hill Member (basal Rosebank Shale) is also diverse. Only two species are common to those two units, reflecting environmental differences. One of them (Strophochonetes kemezysi) extends into the Přídolí, where it is joined by P. (Plectodonta) bipartita. No brachiopod species is known from the basal Devonian at the top of the Yass sequence.

Dinocyst genera such as Selenopemphix, Tuberculodinium, Hystrichokoipoma and Thalasiphora, recorded from the borehole, also support this age assignment. The assemblage indicates a tropical to subtropical humid climate with high rainfall. Deposition of the studied strata took place in a delta under shallow marine influence; this is the first evidence that a marine transgression extended into the Damodar Basin and that mangrove forest developed in the area.

Here, we describe an endemic brachiopod faunule from the middle Xiangshuyuan Formation (middle Aeronian) of Yinjiang in northern Guizhou Province, South China.

    "abstract": "Numerous fragmentary plant fossils are described from the Lower Devonian outcrops near Alexandra, Victoria, southeastern Australia. These outcrops include Eglinton Cutting and two road cuttings on Mount Pleasant and Halls Flat roads previously examined by Isabel Cookson in 1935. Most plants are preserved as iron-stained impressions or coalified compressions lacking internal anatomy in fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. The vast majority of specimens examined proved to be little more than naked fragmentary axes often distributed seemingly randomly; it is the exceptions to these that are examined herein. Most of these specimens belong to the zosterophylls and isolated axes with emergences suggestive of a Gosslingiaceae affinity. Significantly, one specimen attributable to Cooksonia Lang, 1937, renalioid-like sporangia and specimens with isolated sporangia with emergences are recorded for the first time from Victoria. A discussion follows examining the possible reasons for the differences between the Alexandra and Walhalla assemblages, and it is postulated that the differing palaeocurrents indicate the terrestrial sources were from opposite directions. This easterly source for the Walhalla assemblage suggests a subaerial environment may have existed on the eastern side of the Melbourne Zone during the deposition of the Norton Gully Sandstone, earlier than the fluvial deposits of the Middle Devonian Cathedral Beds.Fearghus R.

ISSN 0311-5518Six conodont and one fusuline zones are recognized on basis of a total of 25 conodont and 13 fusuline species (including seven unidentified species or species given with cf. or aff. in total) from the Bamchi Formation, Yeongwol, Korea. The conodont zones include the Streptognathodus bellus, S. isolatus, S. cristellaris, S. sigmoidalis, S. fusus and S. barskovi zones in ascending order, which can be correlated with the conodont zones spanning the uppermost Gzhelian to Asselian Age of the Permian globally. The fusuline zone is named the Rugosofusulina complicata–Pseudoschwagerina paraborealis zone. The co-occurrence of the conodont Streptognathodus isolatus (the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point index for the base of Permian) and Pseudoschwagerina (a Permian inflated fusuline) indicates that the Carboniferous–Permian boundary can be placed in the lower part of the Bamchi Formation in South Korea.Qiulai Wang* [qlwang@nigpas.ac.cn] CAS Key Laboratory of Economic Stratigraphy and Palaeogeography, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, East Beijing Road 39, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Yue Wang* [yuewang@nigpas.ac.cn] LPS, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, East Beijing Road 39, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Yuping Qi* [ypqi@nigpas.ac.cn] Xiangdong Wang* [xdwang@nigpas.ac.cn] CAS Key Laboratory of Economic Stratigraphy and Palaeogeography, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, East Beijing Road 39, Nanjing 210008, PR China; Suk-Joo Choh [sjchoh@korea.ac.kr] Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea; Dong-Chan Lee [dclee@chungbuk.ac.kr] Department of Earth Sciences Education, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Republic of Korea; Dong-Jin Lee [djlee@andong.ac.kr] Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Andong National University, Andong 36729, Republic of Korea. *Also affiliated with: University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19A Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing 100049, PR China.",

The sequence includes the Early — Mid Miocene marine transgression. Dinoflagellates are found throughout the sequence, but they are rare in the Late Eocene, except for two horizons where conditions would have been more marine. The Early — Mid Miocene marine transgression sequence has good spore/pollen and dinoflagellate floras. Five dinoflagellate zones/acmes are recognised and these are useful for at least local correlation with the SADME MC63 bore in the western part of the Basin. When the dinoflagellate zonation is compared with the spore/pollen zonation, there are some minor discrepancies in the position of the boundaries, probably due to palaeogeographic and palaeoecologic factors. The spore/pollen zonation is similar to that of the eastern, nonmarine part of the basin, for the Late Eocene — Oligocene sequence. The Miocene marine sequence, however, differs in that Araucariaceae pollen is abundant, suggesting that araucarian forests grew in coastal and/or riverine environments.",

It is morphologically similar to M. platyceps from the Pleistocene of Lord Howe Island, but, in addition to more subtle features, has a flatter skull, proportionally elongated cranial ‘B’ horn-cores, vestigial or absent ‘A’ horn-cores, and probably a shorter neck. An hypothesis of systematic relationships within Meiolaniidae, using shared, derived cranial characters, supports the suggestion of Gaffney & McNamara (1990) that Meiolania is a monophyletic genus, derived with respect to ‘Meiolania’ oweni. Further, M. brevicollis appears to be advanced with respect to M. platyceps, though the latter is known from much younger strata. The stratigraphic ranges of M. brevicollis and M. platyceps are unknown. The hypothesis that M. platyceps might have evolved from a M. brevicollis-like ancestor is not favoured because it requires a structural reversal in horn-core morphology.",

This deposit yields a fauna essentially consisting of molluscs (bivalves, gastropods) and crustaceans (cirripedes). This fauna exhibits some similarities to Miocene to Recent austral faunas (New Zealand, Argentina) as a result of the establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. However, it has no species in common with the extant Kerguelen fauna. The Mont Rond fossil assemblage is best compared with either of two types of extant communities developed on a bare sandy sea floor where infaunal species are dominant, but most likely to an opportunistic one in depths from approximately 10 to 80 m.",

Two new species C. karuna and C. jhooraensis are here described from the middle Bathonian at Kutch, western India and record the earliest known occurrences of the genus. They constitute ancestor-descendant lineages with the two existing younger species C. pulcherrima and C. rugosa respectively. Evolution in both cases shows ‘parallel’ trends and the descendants are scaled-down versions of their respective progenitors. Statistical analyses reveal that this evolutionary miniaturization involves allometry-induced heterochrony, especially progenesis, and is marked by a rapid speciation event compatible with the punctuational model. Evolution appears to be anagenetic and may be attributed to the unstable nature of environment where onshore innovation produced smaller descendants that adopted r-strategy. Facies distribution and functional morphology suggest that species of Cryptorhynchia were well adapted to shallow, unstable carbonate shelf. However, they disappeared suddenly at the Bathonian - Callovian boundary which was marked by a global transgression.

The latter are the only known representatives of their genera in Australia. A review of Reedops and Paciphacops (including the revision of Phacops mansfieldensis Etheridge & Mitchell, 1896 from Loyola, Victoria) establishes late Lochkovian to early Emsian, and Ludlow to Pragian stratigraphic ranges for these genera respectively. The occurrences of these phacopid genera at Seville indicate placement of the Pragian-Emsian boundary low in the Yeringberg Formation, but above the trilobites. A facies succession including the trilobite-bearing beds at Seville is considered to reflect a widely documented late Pragian regression, and further supports a late Pragian age for the fauna.

Foraminiferal biostratigraphy and facies analysis of the Permian Longge Formation in the Rongma Area, Tibet, China: implications for the palaeogeography of the South Qiangtang Block. Alcheringa XX, x–x.The Permian Longge Formation in the South Qiangtang Block, Tibet, is overwhelmingly composed of carbonate rocks with various skeletal (brachiopods, foraminifers, gastropods, echinoderms, ostracods, corals, bivalves, algae, and bryozoans) and non-skeletal (intraclasts and ooids) components. Three stratigraphic sections of the Longge Formation in the Rongma area of north-central Tibet—known as South Yibug Caka, Niushan and East Yibug Caka—were selected for this study, which examined both sedimentary facies and foraminiferal assemblages. The foraminifers in these sections consist of at least 38 species belonging to 18 genera. Based on the distribution of the foraminifers throughout the composite section, two foraminiferal assemblages were established, and the age of the Longge Formation was determined to be late Kungurian to Capitanian. During lithological studies, ten microfacies were identified using depositional textures, petrographic analysis and faunal content: mudstone, bioclast wackestone, bioclast perforated-foraminifera packstone, bioclast crinoid grainstone, intraclast wackestone, breccia, intraclast grainstone, ooid grainstone, fine crystalline dolostone and residual-grain dolostone. These microfacies are interpreted to represent four depositional environments—restricted lagoon, open marine, shoal and slope—which together suggest a shoal-rimmed carbonate platform. The non-fusuline foraminifers show transitional palaeobiogeographic affinities (Tethyan Cimmerian subregion), and the assemblage is considered to be influenced by the northward drift of the South Qiangtang Block, the climatic warming after the Late Paleozoic Ice Age and warm-water oceanic currents caused by the newly formed Neotethys Ocean. This indicates that the South Qiangtang Block was located in a relatively warm-water, low-latitude area during the middle Permian. The Permian depositional sequences in the Rongma area were also influenced by the palaeogeographic evolution of the South Qiangtang Block.Zhong-Bao Wang [zbwang@cugb.edu.cn] and Zhi-Hong Kang [kangzh98@cugb.edu.cn] School of Energy Resource, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, PR China; Jin-Han Gao* [wang_zhongbao@126.com] and Gen-Hou Wang [wgh@cugb.edu.cn] School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, PR China.",

ISSN 0311-5518.Despite the publication of several taxonomic studies during the last few years, our knowledge of bryozoans from the diversity hotspot of the Indo-West Pacific remains seriously deficient. Here we describe 11 bryozoan species, comprising two anascan- and nine ascophoran-grade cheilostomes, from the middle Miocene (Langhian–Serravallian) of Sedan in Central Java, Indonesia. Three ascophoran-grade cheilostomes, Characodoma multiavicularia sp. nov. Di Martino & Taylor, Stenosipora? cribrata sp. nov. Di Martino & Taylor and Lacrimula patriciae sp. nov. Di Martino & Taylor, are described as new species. All of the three extant species have an Indo-Pacific distribution today and two are here reported as fossil for the first time. Four species are left in open nomenclature, either because of the scarcity of available material or the absence of crucial morphological features. Two of these, placed in Cosciniopsis and Actisecos, are likely to be new, while Discoporella sp. represents the easternmost known record for this common free-living genus.

Similarly in the singly spinose Platyceras (Platyceras) emmemmjae sp. nov., re-entrants suggest an echinoderm relationship.

ISSN 0311-5518A distinctive low-diversity fossil assemblage is reported from the Montys Hut Formation (Walhalla Group; Early Devonian), central Victoria, Australia. The fauna is dominated by two species of chonetoid brachiopods; two other brachiopods also occur in sufficient quantities to warrant description. Taungurungetes gen. nov. (?Devonochonetinae) is created to accommodate the nominate species of the assemblage, T. taggertyensis (Gill) comb. nov., and an additional species is described in open nomenclature from the underlying Norton Gully Sandstone. The other principal chonetoid is Parachonetes sp. cf. P. buchanensis (Gill). Capillate spiriferids from the assemblage were previously reported as Mauispirifer Allan. A redescription of M. hectori Allan shows the Victorian material is not congeneric and it is assigned to Tapongaspirifer melodiae gen. et sp. nov. (Filispiriferidae). The other minor constituent is Mesoleptostrophia belli sp. nov. Other (undescribed) fossils include ammonoids, a placoderm, dacryoconarids and vascular plants. A mid- to late Emsian age is indicated. It is concluded that the assemblage structure is consistent with the well-known high level of endemism in Emsian faunas.C.

Oktavites spiralis, one of the index graptolite species of the Telychian Age (late Llandovery, Silurian), is of great significance in biostratigraphy. However, the broad definition of the species and the lack of data on its evolutionary changes have led to controversies regarding its stratigraphic range and, consequently, to difficulties in regional correlations. Recent investigations in multiple Telychian profiles in the Ziyang–Langao area, along the northern margin of South China, reveal that the first appearance datum of Oktavites spiralis is located at the base of the Spirograptus turriculatus Zone, and its last appearance datum lies at the top of the Cyrtograptus lapworthi Zone (Telychian stage). The thecae vary markedly up-section and such change is consistent across all studied sections. This morphological change can be used as the basis for accurate stratigraphic subdivision and, hence, for effective regional correlation. In addition, this species has a wide range in population size and population density relative to other coexisting graptolite species, and can be better distinguished by using a more precise set of criteria.",

ISSN 0311-5518.The Cenozoic record of fossil crinoids is poor. In part, this is because the stalked taxa have moved into deep water (>100–150 m water depth) since the Cretaceous, but also results from the propensity for the crinoid endoskeleton to disarticulate soon after death. Despite this, we report two new, small crinoid faunas of moderate diversity from the Pliocene of East Kalimantan and the Philippines. Included taxa are columnals of the isocrinid Metacrinus? sp.; a bourgueticrinid cup and columnal, Democrinus? sp.; and cirral and brachial ossicles (isocrinids and comatulids). The preservation of these Pliocene crinoids is not conducive to classification to the level of species, although some taxa are easier to determine than others, but the precise reason for this dearth of complete specimens remains uncertain. Because of our knowledge of extant crinoids, this Cenozoic ‘gap’ has been poorly appreciated. Rather than denigrating the Pliocene crinoids documented herein for being fragmentary and difficult to accurately determine, we instead report them as a rare set of data points, filling, in part, the Cenozoic ‘gap’.Stephen K.

Oldest meiolaniid turtle remains from Australia: evidence from the Eocene Kerosene Creek Member of the Rundle Formation, Queensland. Alcheringa 41, XX–XX. ISSN 0311-5518.Fossil meiolaniid turtles are known only from South America and Australasia. The South American record is restricted to the Eocene, and comprises two genera: Niolamia and Gaffneylania. The Australasian meiolaniid record is more diverse, with three genera known (Ninjemys, Warkalania and Meiolania); however, the oldest known specimens from this continent are significantly younger than those from South America, deriving from upper Oligocene sediments in South Australia and Queensland. Herein, we describe the oldest meiolaniid remains found in Australasia to date. The specimens comprise a posterior peripheral, a caudal ring, and an osteoderm, all of which derive from the middle–upper Eocene Rundle Formation of The Narrows Graben, Gladstone, eastern Queensland. Despite their fragmentary nature, each of these specimens can be assigned to Meiolaniidae with a high level of confidence. This is particularly true of the partial caudal ring, which is strongly similar to those of Niolamia, Ninjemys and Meiolania. The extension of the Australasian meiolaniid record to the Eocene lends strong support to the hypothesis that these turtles arose before South America and Australia detached from Antarctica, and that they were consequently able to spread across all three continents.Stephen F.

This has yielded important palaeoecological and palaeobiogeographical data with respect to the palaeonvironmental reconstruction of the area in relation to sea-level changes, especially since c.7,000 ybp. These data provide new evidence of the strong influence that sea-level fluctuations and climatic change have exerted on the molluscan fauna. This fauna varied in composition and distribution primarily due to progressively decreasing salinity (due to falling sea-level trend after c.7,000–6,500 ybp) and declining temperature (caused by post-hypsithermal cooling after c.4,000 ybp) affecting the bonaerensian coastal area (Río de La Plata and Argentine Sea in the western South Atlantic) during the Holocene. In the Destacamento Río Salado Formation (below or at present day m.s.l., muddy and silty sediments, coastal lagoon environment; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary) the absence of typical euhaline and estuarine species, together with very low faunal diversity, could be a consequence of the cooler ‘Younger Dryas’ event, recognized in other areas of the Southern Hemisphere c.10,800–10,000 ybp. On the basis of the abundance of M. isabelleana and the absence or scarcity among the remaining taxa of euhaline warm water molluscan species, the Pascua Formation (+6–10 m above m.s.l., marine sediments; Upper Pleistocene, >35,000 14C ybp) may represent a late Pleistocene interstadial but not the last Pleistocene transgression (Sangamon) as originally proposed. The data presented here support similar hypotheses by other authors for the area of study and for other localities in the Southern Hemisphere (southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand).

The belemnite punctured completely both valves of the bivalve to the maximum diameter of the belemnite guard, by inferred compaction from sediment overburden during post-mortem biostratinomic processes. Shell thickening of the inoceramid bivalve by shearing of prismatic layers at the site of puncture indicates that the bivalve shell behaved plastically during the puncture and that the great flexibility of the prismatic layers was facilitated by the relatively thin shell and presence of organic sheaths around individual prisms. This flexibility may have been advantageous during a predatory attack, by allowing the maintenance of a seal during breakage of the shell margin.",

    "abstract": "How can historical examination of the Pleistocene extinction question in Australia shed light on ways that scientific debate is influenced by the cultures of science and extra-scientific concerns? In Europe, investigation of the antiquity of man occurred against the background of the invention of glaciology and its incorporation into Charles Lyell's gradualist paradigm, and speculation about fossil fauna. Broadly speaking, these three elements define the terms of a debate that continues today: climatic versus human causes for Pleistocene megafaunal extinction. This paper briefly considers four case studies which illuminate the often contingent nature of scientific knowledge. From nineteenth-century London to 1880s Adelaide to Melbourne in the first decade of the twentieth century to Australian Quaternists in the twenty-first, acceptance or otherwise of Aboriginal testimony and other more material evidence has been conditioned by scientific or political agenda as much as by its intrinsic reliability. These arguments are won in public forums by the weight of rhetoric more than the weight of evidence, perhaps one reason that less deterministic, multi-causal models are rarely debated in the popular media.",

    "abstract": "Father Julian Edmund Tenison Woods arrived at Penola on the 19th March, 1857 as a newly ordained priest and commenced his ministry to the South East region. He was a man of intense intellectual power, with a remarkable sense of inquiry, combined with an absolute and enduring spiritual commitment to the Church. Over the next ten years, he provided an immense service to his parish and its people, established a teaching order of continuing distinction to this day, authored many scientific writings, including his remarkable book on the geology and geography of the South East region, and returned to Adelaide as Director-General of Catholic Education. He was a passionate man, and at times this led him into conflict with the established Church, or other establishments. The Mosquito Plains (now Naracoorte) Caves soon came to his notice and excited his sense of inquiry. Although he had no formal education in geology, he soon developed a genuine understanding of these caves, bringing a remarkable mix of resources to bear upon the questions that they posed. During his early ventures into theology, he benefited from the teaching and friendship of Saint Julian Eymard, and they often walked together through the French countryside discussing what they saw. This both developed his great sense of observation and inevitably fostered his interest in and basic understanding of geology. Then while at Penola, he became friends with Samuel Pratt Winter of the nearby Murndal station in Victoria, who shared his sense of inquiry, and purchased books for him, including Lyell's (1830–1833) Principles of Geology'. He had clearly also read, probably in Winter's library, the work of Thomas Mitchell and others on the Pleistocene fossils from Wellington in New South Wales. His 'Geological Observations in South Australia, principally in the district southeast of Adelaide' was widely acclaimed for its interest and quality. Reading it today, one can only be impressed by his struggle to reconcile his own very acute observations with the wisdom of the great George Lyell. Of course, Lyell was writing from European experience and in total ignorance of the very distinctive nature of the South Australian Karst. Fortunately, Woods was not silenced by deference to the authority of Lyell and others, and presented his own views, including his assessment of the Naracoorte fossils. Again fortunately, when William Reddan arrived at Naracoorte to manage the caves he recognised the importance of Woods' work, and arranged for further continuing inquiry by Stirling and Zeitz of the South Australian Museum. In turn, this (relatively unsuccessful) activity fuelled the initial and continuing exploration of the caves by the speleologists of the 1950s, including myself, and others who followed, eventually discovering the Victoria Fossil cave.",

The second occurrence consists of a series of internal and external moulds from the early Oligocene of the Port Willunga Formation. These represent a new species of the endemic subgenus Lyncina (Austrocypraea), here described as L. (A.) onkastoma. This species is the oldest known member of the subgenus but its apparently derived characteristics indicate that the subgenus had already diversified by this time.

All are from the middle Miocene Colville Sandstone of the Eucla Basin and have historically been referred to this genus without description. These new taxa differ from previously described Monostychia species in several morphological features, such as size and shape but also in the number of post-basicoronal interambulacral plates developed in the oral paired interambulacrum, a feature considered taxonomically important at both genus and species level for clypeasteroids. The number of ambulacral plates in the paired and unpaired oral regions is also considered a potentially diagnostic taxonomic feature for this genus; it is concluded that the oral ambulacral plate count, particularly that of the unpaired ambulacrum III, is at least as useful a taxonomic feature as the oral interambulacral plate count.Tony Sadler [t.sadler@student.unimelb.edu.au] and Stephen J.

Alcheringa 43, 291–319. ISSN 0311-5518The palaeobiology of the Malay Archipelago region remains poorly documented, despite its present-day significance as a modern global marine biodiversity hotspot. The Togopi Formation of the Dent Peninsula, situated in Borneo on the western Sulu Sea and eastern coast of Sabah, Malaysia, preserves Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary sequences interpreted to represent localized transgressive episodes, and which have a relatively high coral diversity. Fossil corals were sampled from three available quarries on the Dent Peninsula, the sediments of which have been previously dated as 4.5–3.4 Ma in age based on foraminiferal data and radiometric analyses. These Pliocene corals are identified here based on their macromorphology, micromorphology and microstructural characteristics. In total, this study describes 28 fossil coral taxa, with 16 genera recognized and 22 taxa identified to species level, 21 of which can be confidently assigned to extant species. These new data have resulted in revised stratigraphic ranges for eight of these species. As the most comprehensive systematic survey of corals from the Pliocene of the Indo-Pacific to date, this study indicates a high diversity of corals on the margin of the Sabah Sea, Borneo, at this time, including taxa found today, thus casting doubt on the local impact of the Plio-Pleistocene extinction previously reported from faunal analyses of the central Indo-Pacific.Jasmin V.M.

This method calculates palaeobathymetric limits from the septal geometry of Nautilus, based upon the premise that septa are the weakest structural .unit of the shell. We examined this proposal by evaluating data relating to ontogeny, septum formation, septal geometry, and microstructure of Nautilus. Our main results are: 1) septal strength index of embryonic and juvenile septa are not representative of the depths at which such specimens live, 2) septa become fully functional in resisting hydrostatic pressure at thicknesses significantly less than that used to compute strength index, 3) no correlation has been demonstrated between septal strength index and rupture pressure, and 4) shell microstructure does not show sufficient uniformity among cephalopods to permit an undocumented assumption of uniformity in mechanical properties of cephalopod shell material. These observations indicate that: 1) Nautilus is an improper paradigm upon which to base depth calculations for fossils, 2) strength index misidentifies septa as the weak link in cephalopod shell design, and 3) the strength index approach must be refined to accommodate the effects of sutural characteristics and other factors, before it can be regarded as providing accurate estimates for living depths of fossil cephalopods.",

The age is based on analysis of calcareous nannofossils. The sediment accumulated in very shallow, warm, fully marine conditions, apparently off a coast of periodically low runoff, and the fauna lacks any planktonic foraminiferal species. While it is domainated by several typically Paleocene benthic forms well known from southern and southwestern Australia, several otherwise typical Australian forms appear to be absent. Fabiania (the new species F. macgowrani) is recorded for the first time from Australia, apparently the earliest known occurrence of the genus. Paleocene rocks of this age are also known from the Perth Basin and Northwest Shelf of Western Australia and it seems these indicate the need for recognition of a new sedimentation cycle in the Cainozoic of Australia.",

Nine-two disarticulated ilia from the highland Nombe rockshelter deposit represent a minimum of six species: two Hylidae and four Microhylidae; most of these ilia were deposited in the late Pleistocene before significant human activity at the site.

Palynoassemblages recovered within the Mesozoic sequence are assigned to three palynozones closely comparable to Australian assemblages. The oldest palynozone is the Verrucosisporites-Lundbladispora zone, which occurs between 373.5–376 m in the uppermost Panchet Formation. The first occurrence of Callialasporites turbatus occurs at 373.5 m and signals the presence of Jurassic deposits. The overlying Infratrappean greyshales (371.5–354 m) of the Rajmahal Formation is represented by the Murospora florida palynozone of Late Jurassic age. The youngest palynozone identified is the Cicatricosisporites australiensis zone which occurs within the Inter-trappeans (346.35–295.0 m) of the Rajmahal Formation. Based on ages assigned to the M. florida and C. australiensis zones in Australia, the Rajmahal Formation is dated as Oxfordian-Berriasian. The first appearance datums (FADs) of Cicatricosisporites australiensis, Crybelosporites stylolsus, Aequitriradites spinulosus and Lycopodiacidites dettmannae suggest that the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary probably lies just within the interval 346.35–328.81 m in Inter-trappean bed II.

    "abstract": "Repaired shell injuries, widely reported mainly on mollusks, give first hand evidence of biological activity in fossil communities. Scars in fossil brachiopods from predation are rarely found, particularly after major biotic crises. A repair scar on a lingulid brachiopod Pseudolingula? sp. that lived immediately after the end Ordovician mass extinction is reported for the first time here. The specimen, cohabited with other components of Cathaysiorthis fauna, was collected from the basal Shiyang Formation (earliest Rhuddanian, Llandovery, Silurian), Jiangxi, southeast China. The scar’s near-margin position and its drape-like shape, together with the quiet middle to deeper shelf living environment and nearly infaunal lifestyle of the species, suggest that the shell damage was biotic-induced, from a failed predation, possibly by a nautiloid cephalopod. The successful repair supports previous studies showing that environmental conditions ameliorated quickly after the extinction. To analyze its repair mode, another repaired specimen of its living relative Lingula anatina collected from the Yellow Sea, China was examined here as well. Compared to the much more efficient repair for the living lingulids, the drape-like structure of the scar on the shell of Pseudolingula? sp. is more similar to the published repair specimens of Cambrian lingulate brachiopods, which may indicate the evolution of its repair mechanisms.Bing Huang [bhuang@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 East Beijing Road, Nanjing 210008, China; Rongyu Li [lir@brandonu.ca] Department of Geology, Brandon University, 270-18th Street, Brandon, Manitoba R7A 6A9, Canada.",

    "abstract": "The fossil record of phyllocarids in Australia is decidedly limited, with only a few specimens known from Ordovician to Devonian deposits. Therefore, the identification of examples from older deposits would uncover more facets of Gondwanan crustacean evolution. Here, a supposed phyllocarid reported by Chapman (1925 Chapman, F., 1925. The Wade Collection of Fossils. Government Printer, Melbourne. [Google Scholar]) from the Mount John Shale Member of the Wade Creek Formation is reconsidered. We conclude that the 'phyllocarid'-like structure is somewhat morphologically comparable to traces ascribed to the activity of bivalved arthropods. However, as the Mount John Shale Member is likely Mesoproterozoic in age, the most parsimonious explanation is that the structure is a cast created by abiotic activity. Re-examination of such specimens represents a useful approach to clarifying previous misidentifications in the literature and is an important application of historically valuable specimens and collections.R.D.C.

    "abstract": "Rhabdotaenia, a typical leaf type of Gondwana (e.g., India, Australia, Africa, South America) is described from the Umm Irna Formation (Permian) of the Dead Sea Region, Jordan. Two fragments with well-preserved cuticles were collected during fieldwork in 2017 from a single locality. They are characterized by a taeniopterid morphology and sparsely anastomosing veins. Veins arise from the rachis at acute angles of about 45°, immediately dichotomize and recurve slightly to run at about 80° to the rachis straight towards the margin, sporadically dichotomizing a second time and forming sparse anastomoses. Epifluorescence microscopy revealed that stomata are confined to intercostal fields and are haplocheilic with exposed guard cells surrounded by only poorly differentiated subsidiary cells. Ordinary epidermal cells are characterized by slightly sinuous cell walls within intercostal fields. The new material is the northernmost occurrence of this genus reported so far, well within the palaeoequatorial belt of Pangea. This occurrence highlights the floral relationship of some assemblages of the so called ‘mixed floras’ of the Arabian Peninsula with Gondwana, and demonstrates that the Umm Irna Formation, in particular, still holds great potential for future palaeobotanical discoveries.Patrick Blomenkemper [p_blom02@uni-muenster.de], Paläobotanik, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Heisenbergstraße 2, 48149 Münster, Germany; Hans Kerp [kerp@uni-muenster.de], Paläobotanik, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Heisenbergstraße 2, 48149 Münster, Germany; Abdalla Abu Hamad [abdalla80@hotmail.com], University of Jordan, Queen Rania St, 2V7F + 85 Amman, Jordan; Benjamin Bomfleur [bbomfleur@uni-muenster.de], Paläobotanik, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Heisenbergstraße 2, 48149 Münster, Germany.",

    "abstract": "The South Primorye area of Far East Russia has long been recognized for its highly diverse mid-Permian brachiopod fauna; however, a taxonomic and palaeobiogeographical reassessment is overdue. This paper describes two brachiopod assemblages from the Barabash and Pilnikov section localities in South Primorye. The Barabash section assemblage was collected from the lower part of the Barabashevka Formation and includes 18 brachiopod species associated with other marine faunas indicative of the late Wordian. Alternatively, the Pilnikov section assemblage derives from the Pilnikov Formation and yields four brachiopod species consistent with the mid-Kungurian (Irenian). The palaeobiogeographical composition of the Barabash assemblage is distinguished by a conspicuous admixture of cool-water Boreal Realm elements and palaeoequatorial warm-water Cathaysian Province elements, together with genera that have antitropical distributions. Comparisons with analogous Neogene faunas from the Sea of Japan/East Sea suggest that the Barabash section might have been situated in the eastern part of the Sino-Mongolian seaway, which was located in an equivalent mid-latitude northern temperate confluence of warm- and cold-water ocean currents.G.

These can suffer different types of lesions that may be permanent or disappear with wear through action of the jaws. Here, we describe pathologies on the tooth plates of Metaceratodus baibianorum from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) La Colonia Formation of Patagonia in Argentina. Of the total number of analysed tooth plates (N = 127), 27.5% show signs of different pathologies including caries, abscesses, hyperplasia, fractures, alterations in growth, and erosion. No tooth plates with parasitic invasions, attrition or osteopenia were observed. Some examples of occlusal caries show pulpal overgrowths on the pulp surface. CT scanning demonstrates that these are similar to tertiary dentine in their coincidence with lesions, higher density relative to the surrounding dentine, and fewer pulp canals resulting in fewer dentinal tubules. Such features may indicate that dipnoans are, or at least were, able to generate some form of reparative or reactionary dentine.Karen Magalí Panzeri [k.panzeri@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar], División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Unidades de Investigación Anexo Museo, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Museo, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Avenida 122 y 60, LA Plata, 1900, Argentina, CONICET Godoy Cruz 2290, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina; Nahuel Antu Muñoz [nahuelmunoz@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar], División Paleontología Vertebrados, Museo de La Plata, Unidades de Investigación Anexo Museo, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Museo, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Avenida 122 y 60, LA Plata, 1900, Argentina, CONICET Godoy Cruz 2290, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.",

    "abstract": "Since its first appearance in the early Miocene, the cheilostome bryozoan genus Microporella has been cosmopolitan, recorded from most continents. However, Miocene Microporella records in New Zealand are scarce, and currently limited to a single middle Miocene species identified as Microporella hyadesi (a Recent bifoliate erect form originally described from Cape Horn and Tierra del Fuego) from the Mt. Brown 'E' Limestone Formation of North Canterbury. Here, we describe and illustrate three new early Miocene (Otaian–Altonian New Zealand stages corresponding to the Aquitanian–Burdigalian) species, namely Microporella incurvata sp. nov., M. gladirostra sp. nov. and M. whiterocki sp. nov., that represent the geologically oldest regional examples of the genus to date. A fourth species is left in open nomenclature because complete ovicells are not preserved in the only recovered specimen. The colonies of Microporella were collected from several rock formations exposed in limestone quarries on the South Island. The three new species share ovicells with a personate structure, but differ in the appearance of the ooecial surface (evenly pseudoporous versus imperforate), shape of the ascopore opening (cribrate versus non-cribrate), number of oral spine bases, and shape of the avicularian rostrum and crossbar. We also illustrate for the first time ovicells of another fossil species, Microporella rusti, from the Pleistocene Nukumaru Limestone Formation of the Wanganui Basin on the North Island. The ovicells of this taxon are rare, being found in only six of several hundred specimens collected to date. The ovicells of M. rusti are also very large, covering the entire orifice of the maternal zooid, similar to those of some other Microporella species all characterized by erect bifoliate colonies contrasting with the encrusting colonies of M. rusti.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5430969F-B75B-40E7-8F65-74CDC87AA662Mali H.

Our observations indicate the insertion of counter lateral septa and their neighbouring catasepta on the counter side takes place in exactly the same manner as that of the subsequent metasepta and catasepta. We propose abandoning the use of the term counter lateral septa.

The fossils exhibit minimal dental wear and reveal new characters that are unrecognizable in the holotype. The remains represent at least three animals, effectively doubling the previous number of individuals known for this rare megaherbivore. The new records also provide a significant northern geographic range extension for the species and allow an assessment of intraspecific variation, sexual dimorphism and phylogenetic relationships for the species.

In this paper we describe 12 brachiopod species and an indeterminate ingelarellid from the SPF, including one new species (Tasmanospirifer jervisbayensis sp. nov. Waterhouse & Lee). Though this brachiopod fauna is evidently associated with an interglacial stratigraphic interval, its taxonomic characteristics overall resemble those from stratigraphically bounding glacial intervals. This association is interpreted to indicate persistence and the strong endemic nature of the Permian Eastern Australian biogeographic province in high-latitude eastern Gondwana, regardless of glacial/interglacial climate states during the Cisuralian. Biostratigraphically, the SPF brachiopod fauna is divisible into two distinctive stratigraphic assemblages: the Notospirifer cf. triplicata–Simplicisulcus sp. Assemblage in the lower part of the formation and the Johndearia brevis–Sulciplica transversa Assemblage in the upper part, each distinguished by a set of unique species.Sangmin Lee [sangminlee76@gmail.com] andG.

    "abstract": "Ontogenetic allometry, the covariation of shape with size over the course of development, represents a fundamental component of morphological diversification that can vary across species and in association with ecological factors. Ontogenetic allometry patterns for the skull have been described for species from several marsupial lineages, associated with common dietary niches, e.g., carnivory. We here conduct a novel detailed examination of cranial ontogeny in the numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), unique among marsupials in being myrmecophagous and adopting a strictly diurnal habit. We investigated ontogenetic allometry using multivariate analyses in a postnatal series (n = 28) of complete numbat skulls to estimate the rate of growth of its major constituent elements, described by 15 measurements. We find positive allometry for length of the nasals and palate, which relates directly to the remarkable rostral elongation in the species relative to other marsupials, in addition to several other ontogenetic changes. These comprise negative allometry of palate breadth, elongation of upper and lower toothrows that produces diastemata between weakly developed teeth, and decreasing muzzle height, all of which contribute to the development of a long, tapering, narrow rostrum, with limited mastication ability, as seen in the small temporal space and poor development of crests and processes associated with jaw musculature. Our specific allometric results and comparisons, together with qualitative observations, reveal a distinct imprint of myrmecophagy on skull ontogeny in the numbat and help explain the development and evolution of specialized feeding function of this species.Norberto P.

Since this species was split from its west coast counterpart, Perameles bougainville, no fossil record had been reported. Perameles fasciata is found in five fossil sites in Queensland and New South Wales, all Pleistocene in age. Perameles sobbei, described from the Darling Downs in Queensland, is found to be a junior synonym of P. fasciata, based on morphometrics and diagnostic morphological features. A morphological phylogeny finds that P. fasciata is more closely related to Perameles nasuta, Perameles pallescens and Perameles gunnii than P. bougainville. Perameles fasciata was likely more widespread in the Pleistocene, but by the Holocene had only survived on the Liverpool Plains in New South Wales until its extinction in the 1860s, probably as a result of land clearing and the introduction of foxes. While P. bougainville has been translocated in New South Wales, P. gunnii, which co-occurred with P. fasciata, is a better ecological analogue because of it is similar size, morphology and phylogenetic affinity.Kenny J.

Prior to this study, the fossil record of Ptilonorhynchidae was limited to late Quaternary remains from Victoria, Australia. A new genus and species of bowerbird is described here from the late Oligocene (ca 26–23 Ma) deposits of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, in Waanyi Country, Queensland, Australia. This fossil bowerbird is smaller than most extant species of bowerbirds, and represents the earliest known evidence of Ptilonorhynchidae, although its intrafamilial affinities remain uncertain pending additional material. A second, larger ptilonorhynchid is identified from the early Miocene (ca 16 Ma) of Riversleigh. These fossils considerably extend the temporal range of Ptilonorhynchidae, and indicate the presence of two species of bowerbirds in the Oligo-Miocene of northern Australia. The ages of these fossils are consistent with molecular estimates of the divergence time between Ptilonorhynchidae and its sister group, Climacteridae (Australo-Papuan treecreepers). The new bowerbird is the ninth species of passerine to be described from the pre-Pleistocene of Australia, and highlights the importance of the Riversleigh fossil deposits in our understanding of the early evolutionary history of passerines.Jacqueline M.T.

    "abstract": "Urrayira whitei gen. et sp. nov. is described based on dental remains from middle Pleistocene cave sites at Mount Etna, Queensland. Its higher-level systematic affinities are unclear but it appears to be a dasyuromorphian. It is unusual in having a specialized reduced dentition characterized by reduction of the stylar cusps, protocone and talonid, resulting in an incipiently zalambdodont morphology that emphasizes the shearing crests. In addition, only two upper premolars are present, and we assume that it is P3 that has been suppressed, as has occurred multiple times within Dasyuridae. Maximum parsimony and undated Bayesian analyses of a 174 morphological character matrix intended to resolve relationships within Dasyuromorphia, with a molecular scaffold enforced, suggest that Urrayira is a dasyurid. In the maximum parsimony analysis, Urrayira is sister to Planigale gilesi (which also lacks P3), whereas in the undated Bayesian analysis, Urrayira resolves as part of a trichotomy at the base of Dasyuridae, together with Sminthopsinae and Dasyurinae; however, support values are generally low throughout the tree. While the majority of rainforest-adapted taxa in the Mount Etna sites became either extinct or were locally extirpated at, or soon after, 280 ka, there is no evidence that U. whitei gen. et sp. nov. even persisted until that time. Urrayira whitei was likely a rainforest-specialist, thus may have been particularly vulnerable to incipient effects of the Mid-Brunhes climatic shift towards aridity that eventually drove the disappearance of the Mount Etna rainforest and its associated fauna.Jonathan Cramb* [jonathan.cramb@qm.qld.gov.au], Queensland Museum, PO Box 3300, South Brisbane BC, Queensland 4101, Australia; Scott Hocknull [scott.hocknull@qm.qld.gov.au], Queensland Museum, PO Box 3300, South Brisbane BC, Queensland 4101, Australia; Robin M.

    "abstract": "AbstractMolar morphologies of the latest Oligocene genera, Chunia and Ektopodon, are easy to distinguish, but species determinations are more difficult. As more specimens have been collected, more maxillary fragments with molars and/or alveoli and a portion of the rostrum preserved are available. With a suite of maxillae now known, new ektopodontid features have revealed themselves, including the shortening of the rostrum compared to other families of contemporary possums. The facial angulation represented by the flexure of the rostrum at the boundary between P3 and the molar row results in the rostrum being angled differently than the molar row. Ektopodontids have a significantly greater angulation and thus shorter faces, compared to that seen in contemporary phalangeriform possums. Two new species of the genus Chunia, from the lower Etadunna Formation, South Australia, can be distinguished from the type species, Chunia illuminata, of the Ditjimanka Local Fauna. Differences in molar morphologies and the degree of facial angulation distinguish a new species of Chunia from the lowest faunal zone and the Minkina Local Fauna (facial angulation of 52°) from C. illuminata from the next higher faunal zone (Ditjimanka Local Fauna), which has a greater facial angulation of 63°, while a second new species of Chunia, also from the Dijimanka Local Fauna, has a facial angulation of 58° and intermediate molar traits. The degree of facial shortening is a valid discriminator between species of ektopodontid marsupials as it coincides with the species level differences in dental morphology. Additionally, C. omega from the Tarkarooloo Local Fauna is placed in new genus, Ngathachunia, as it is outside of the hypodigms for both of the previously described genera, Chunia and Ektopodon. A well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the family indicates the species of Ektopodon form a monophyletic clade, while the species of Chunia are paraphyletic.Judd A.

    "abstract": "Twenty-three trilobite taxa are described here from the Early Ordovician (Tremadocian to Floian) Nambeet Formation retrieved from the Barnicarndy 1 drillcore, Canning Basin, Western Australia. This includes one new genus, Veeversaspis gen. nov., and six new species: Asaphellus zheni sp. nov., Madiganaspis lauriei sp. nov., Norasaphus (Norasaphus) jagoi sp. nov., Rodingaia leggi sp. nov., Sanbernardaspis excalibur sp. nov., and Veeversaspis jelli gen. et sp. nov. This fauna can be divided into three stratigraphically distinct assemblages, the Apatokephalus sp.–Veeversaspis jelli gen. et sp. nov. Assemblage (2177.50–2382.94 m depth), Asaphellus trinodosus Assemblage (2030.07–2177.52 m depth), and Asaphellus zheni sp. nov. Assemblage (1595.83–2001.88 m depth). The two stratigraphically lowest assemblages are consistent with a late to latest Tremadocian age (both within the Paroistodus proteus Zone). The third, and highest, assemblage is consistent with a mid-Floian age (within the Oepikodus communis Zone). This systematic contribution refines previous biostratigraphic work based on an age-diagnostic conodont fauna and demonstrates the stratigraphic utility of using multiple taxonomic groups for more robust biostratigraphic age estimates.P.M.

This new taxon is described from Gzhelian strata exposed at Tante Victoire in Var, France. Additionally, we present a remarkably well-preserved forewing from the same outcrop belonging to the phyloblattid genus and species Anthracoblattina ensifer cf. 'variety desguini'. This species was previously known from the Gzhelian of Commentry in Allier, France. Therefore, this finding strengthens the Gzhelian age derived from the study of the palaeoflora at this outcrop. In this study, we also briefly delve into the inter- and intraspecific variability in the forewing venation of the 'Anthracoblattina gigantea-ensifera group'. Furthermore, we challenge the classification of two Mesozoic roachoids, Sobytie tungusicum Vršanský, Citation2010 and Pozabudnutie antiquorum Hinkelman and Vršanský, 2022, which, in our view, do not belong to the Phyloblattidae family. Instead, they should be regarded as Dictyoptera of uncertain family affinities. A comprehensive revision of these species will be necessary to establish their precise taxonomic positions.André Nel [anel@mnhn.fr], Romain Garrouste [romain.garrouste@mnhn.fr], Corentin Jouault [jouaultc0@gmail.com], Institut de Systématique, Évolution, Biodiversité (ISYEB) Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, EPHE, Université des Antilles, CP50, 45 rue Buffon 75005, Paris, France; Univ.

    "abstract": "Sphenothallus is a tubular organism that is one of the most widely distributed and longest-ranging genera through the Palaeozoic. Despite its apparent cosmopolitan distribution, the genus has never been reported from North China. New specimens of Sphenothallus sp. have been discovered in the upper part of the Houjiashan and base of the Mantou formations (early to middle Age 4, Epoch 2, Cambrian) in Jiangsu Province, North China. The specimens are small tubes (up to 5 mm long) and have typical Sphenothallus characteristics, such as a multilayered lamellar structure, and subcircular to elliptical transverse cross-section with a pair of longitudinal thickenings situated at the widest diameter. Our material shows that both the rate of apertural expansion and the curvature of the tubes are significantly larger in early growth stages than in the later growth stages. As the diameter of the aperture increases, the transverse cross-section of the Sphenothallus sp. tube changes from subcircular at the proximal end to elliptical or lenticular at the distal end, and its wall thickness changes from uniform to thickening longitudinally. The discovery of Sphenothallus sp. from the North China Platform represents an extension of its palaeogeographic range during the Cambrian.",

Within the Polyprotodonta Dasyurus shows a simple schmelzmuster with radial and aprismatic enamel only, whereas the highly specialized teeth of Sarcophilus and Thylacinus show more complex schmelzmuster consisting of several enamel types. Both differ from each other and from other marsupials. Sarcophilus combines radial enamel, tangential enamel and stripes, Thylacinus combines radial enamel, tangential enamel, irregular enamel and stripes in its enamel. In both species the schmelzmuster varies within the dentition. Thylacoleo carnifex is the only carnivorous species within the dominatly herbivorous group Diprotodonta. It has distinct canine-like incisors and bladelike premolars that show a very complex enamel structure consisting of radial, tangential, irregular and zipper enamel and simultaneous prism deviations. Some of these enamel types are restricted to diprotodont marsupials and others are frequent in marsupials and placentals. The combination of enamel types in Thylacoleo differs from other studied marsupial carnivores. However, similar, but less complex schmelzmuster are present in other diprotodontids. In their combination of enamel types Sarcophilus, Thylacinus and Thylacoleo are unique. The high level of stuctural complexity within the specialized teeth of carnivorous marsupials indicates an adaptation to different loading conditions within and between teeth.",

All species share the cephalic features of a long, gently-waisted glabella reaching or partly overhanging the anterior border; isolated pre-occipital lobes; long crescentic eyes and dense nodose ornament. Most features remain stable except for an anterior shift of the highest point of the glabella and a change from outwardly crescentic to near vertical, very tall eyes which are concealed from the dorsal view. Pygidia have a phillipsiid-form with segments exhibiting a sawtooth profile and a row of nodes along their high posterior edge. Over the group, the ring count drops marginally from 14 + to 13 but the rib count drops markedly, by post-axial contraction, from 12 to 7. Both rings and ribs are aligned anteriorly with the ribs curving progressively backwards to become sub-parallel to the axis. P. squamata has no border but the ribs stop short of the edge leaving a narrow smooth margin. In Weberiphillipsia spp. a border is developed on to which the ribs continue as low ridges. Nodes on these border ribs become coarser and fewer, being reduced to one in the last species. As the rib count drops, the border ornament becomes detached and slightly rotated from the ribs, accumulating as a cluster of fading, post-axial nodes. Concurrently, the ornament recedes from the outer margin leaving a smooth outer half on the border. In the final species, a second false border appears outside the ornament which then appears as a detached, offset part of the pleural rib. Over the five species, both axial and pleural nodes decline in number from 13 to 4, combined with a corresponding increase in size. The stratigraphic distribution of this evolutionary development is detailed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the most prolific trilobites in the mid-Palaeozoic of central Victoria is the dalmanitid Dalmanites wandongensis Gill, 1948. Extensive museum collections permit a revised diagnosis and a redescription of the species, and an interpretation of its distribution. The affinities of D. wandongensis lie with South American species assigned to Dalmanites and the closely related Kasachstania rather than northern hemisphere taxa including the D. caudata group. It occurs between Heathcote and Yan Yean in central Victoria, in late Wenlock and early Ludlow (Silurian) strata of the Dargile Group, on the eastern margins of the Melbourne Zone; its greatest abundance is between Kilmore and Wandong, where it is documented from over fifty localities, occurring rarely with other trilobite taxa. At Heathcote, Upper Plenty, Yan Yean and Kilmore East D. wandongensis stratigraphically underlies a more diverse trilobite fauna dominated by the encrinurid Cromus simpliciculus. This trilobite faunal succession defines a significant macrofaunal biostratigraphic datum in the sequence, complementing brachiopod and graptolite zonations. This datum is coincident with a subtle but widespread change in lithology that defines the lithostratigraphic boundary between the Yan Yean Formation and the Melbourne Formation. In the structurally complex and poorly exposed sequences of the Kilmore East area the distribution of D. wandongensis is used as a primary tool in mapping the distribution of these units. Outcrop patterns reveal the presence of two large scale east-northeast-oriented faults traversing the area that support a model of deformation for the Melbourne Zone in which transverse shearing is significant. Taphofacies and biofacies distribution in the Yan Yean Formation indicate a deep-water shelf depositional environment, at depths below maximum storm-wave base in the Kilmore-Wandong area, deepening eastwards, with outer shelf environments between Yan Yean and Christmas Hills.

The bryozoan genus Protoretepora de Koninck, 1878 is based on the species Fenestella ampla from Australia described by Lonsdale in Darwin (1844) and in de Strzelecki (1845). However, the original descriptions and illustrations clearly depict a mixture of fenestrate species. This led to the subsequent assignment by various authors of a range of taxa to Protoretepora from Permian successions at several localities. The name Protoretepora ampla has been applied to several species, not necessarily in Protoretepora. Fenestella ampla Lonsdale in Darwin, 1844, the type species of Protoretepora, was originally described from material collected by Darwin, and a year later was further described from collections made by de Strzelecki. Some of de Strzelecki's illustrations clearly show colonies as having coalescing branches bearing autozooecia with no dissepiments, and it was on the basis of this material collected by de Strzelecki that de Koninck erected the genus Protoretepora. Examination of de Strzelecki's material from the Permian of Tasmania has allowed restriction of Protoretepora to the taxa with these coalescing branches that lack dissepiments; those with dissepiments described by Lonsdale in Darwin (1844) have been placed in Parapolypora Morozova & Lisitsyn, Citation1996. The status of Protoretepora is clarified and two new species are described from the Permian of Australia: P. crockfordae and P. wassi.

The threefold subdivision of the zone is confirmed. The Swains Gully Section in the Werrie Syncline is reinstated as the reference for the Spirifer sol and base of the Schellwienella burlingtonensis Zones. Section 39 in the Rouchel Block is selected as a reference section for the middle part of the S. burlingtonensis Zone. The upper part of the zone is best represented by the Mt Richardson Section in the Gresford Block and Section 30 in the Rouchel Block. The lower part of the zone is characterised by the first appearance of the nominate species, Kitakamithyris rouchelensis and Antiquatonia spinulicosta, which persist through the higher part of the zone; the middle part (the Pustula gracilis - Megachonetes alatus Subzone) by the first appearance of Pustula gracilis, Megachonetes alatus, Syringothyris texta, Kitakamithyris uniplicata, Spirifer (Mesochorispira) cf. grimesi and Crassumbo gresfordensis sp. nov.; and the upper part (the Marginatia patersonensis Subzone) by the first appearance of M. patersonenensis, Schuchertella cf. planumbona, Orthotetes australis, Brachythyris elliptica and Asyrinxia cf. lata.

    "abstract": "Antarctic Cenozoic climate changes have influenced the development of the Southern Ocean benthic diatom flora. When Antarctica and South America separated in the late Eocene (∼37 Ma), giving rise to the proto-Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the environment gradually changed from temperate alpine glacial to subpolar with ice sheet development. By the early Oligocene (∼ 30 Ma), at least thirteen new benthic diatom genera had appeared in the Antarctic. Many of the genera probably migrated from lower latitudes (e.g. New Zealand) prior to the ACC becoming fully established (23 ± 2.5 Ma), which increased the physical separation of Antarctica. Further migration may have occurred during later periods of climate warming, but the Cenozoic was generally a time of progressive climate cooling, and increased glaciation that may have caused diatom extinctions. Some genera became extinct during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene, for example, when glaciers covered much of the Antarctic continental shelf. Many of the benthic diatom genera now extinct in Antarctica still occur in ice-free environments at lower latitudes. Most extant benthic Antarctic diatom taxa are eurytopic and probably survived Cenozoic glaciations by either inhabiting sea-ice or becoming planktic, as sea-floor habitats were restricted.",

An anteroposteriorly directed basipterygoid process, an optic nerve foramen positioned dorsal to the basipterygoid process, and an oculomotor nerve foramen located posterodorsal to the basipterygoid process are established as autapomorphies. Owensia shares a broad ethmosphenoid shield, a lack of discernible sutures between the bones of the snout and a dorsoventrally shallow skull with cosmine-covered members of the Canowindridae. Owensia also shares the first two of these features and an occluded view of the nostrils from the dorsal surface with Gyroptychius? australis. However, the phylogenetic relationships between these taxa remain unclear. Superficial comparisons between Owensia and the Northern Hemisphere Lamprotolepis are rejected, with the position of the latter within the Tetrapodomorpha being questioned. A benthic niche for Owensia is suggested based on the presence of a dorsoventrally shallow skull.

The plant consists of more than three orders of axis branching, each axis being less than 2 mm wide. The second-order axes are short, laterally and alternately attached to the main axis. The third-order axes are paired and anisotomously divided, bearing the vegetative appendages or the fertile units. The fertile unit consists of a short recurved axis giving off up to four short pedicels along one side, each of which bears one to four pairs of terminal sporangia. Douaphyton has a three-dimensional branching system that has an intermediate form in the evolutionary context of euphyllophytes and lignophytes.

ISSN 0311-5518.Catenagraptus communalis gen. nov. sp. nov. is a late Floian (Early Ordovician) graptolite from Victoria, Australia, only found as fragments, with each fragment resembling an assemblage of uniserial tubarium-like structures (pseudotubaria) connected by threads (aulons). Individual pseudotubaria consist of a fallosicula and a stipe, both of which are linked by aulons to other pseudotubaria. Adjacent pseudotubaria are in a parent–offspring relationship. Aulons can be generated from both the proximal and distal extremities of fallosiculae, and from the ends of stipes. The aulons are interpreted to have been grown by the zooid that occupied either the fallosicula or the terminal theca of the stipe. Aulons were pathways for a zooid that built a fallosicula at the end of the aulon. This process was repeated to form the assemblage. None of the assemblages contain a true sicula, which suggests that the assemblages present evidence of a new, asexual propagation strategy that involved fragmentation and dispersal. As this interpretation is radical, other models explored are partial sclerotization and modified sicular spines.Alfons H.M.

In the most extreme examples, female morphology has become modified to create depressions on the test where offspring may be sheltered throughout development. Since a number of the features used for taxonomic classification are lost on fossilization, it can be difficult to recognize fossil individuals as the dimorphic males and females of the same species. In addition, diagnoses of dimorphic taxa commonly concentrate on the striking female traits, hindering identification of the simpler male form. Here, we present an approach based on morphology and crystallographic determination of developmental mode that allows the recognition of the males of marsupiate echinoid taxa. Males of the brooding temnopleurid Pentechinus mirabilis from the Oligocene of Victoria, Australia are described for the first time.",

A total of 5228 conodont specimens, assigned to 20 genera and 29 species, were recovered from 56 carbonate samples. Seven conodont biozones are recognized, including (in ascending order) the Lenodus antivariabilis, the L. variabilis, the Yangtzeplacognathus crassus, the Dzikodus tablepointensis, the Y. jianyeensis, the Baltoniodus alobatus and the Hamarodus brevirameus biozones. They provide new data for an improved biostratigraphic correlation of these formations regionally and internationally. Furthermore, the detailed conodont biostratigraphy reveals a hiatus between the top of the Kuniutan Formation and its overlying Datianba Formation at the Daling section, missing the stratigraphic interval spanning from the Eoplacognathus suecicus Biozone (middle Darriwilian) to the lower part of the Pygodus anserinus Biozone (lower Sandbian). Based on the conodont data from the Daling section, the conodont biodiversity shows a prominent increasing trend within the D. tablepointensis Biozone (middle Darriwilian) in the Kuniutan Formation and a moderately increasing trend in the H. brevirameus Biozone (lower Katian) in the Pagoda Formation.Fang-yi Gong* [fygong@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; Center for Excellence in Life and Palaeoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.

    "abstract": "As applied to bone, ‘determinate growth’ identifies an upper limit to size and the point when normal endochondral ossification ceases. This contrasts with ‘indeterminate growth’, which proceeds through the entire life of the animal. In this study, a non-destructive method, epi-illumination surface microscopy of the articular surfaces of long bones, is applied for the first time in 40 taxa of non-avian dinosaurs to determine cessation of endochondral growth. Thereby, the presence or absence of articular vascular channels between the endochondral bone and the cartilage is assessed. As articular vascular channels are the major source of nutrients for continued longitudinal growth, atrophy or loss of those channels would preclude continued growth of bone. We correlated our findings with published histological data and bone length measurements. We found articular vascular channels in all assessed dinosaur groups, but some individuals showed a loss of detectable articular vascular channels – what we interpret as evidence of longitudinal skeletal growth cessation. This observation contrasts with the hypothesis of continuous indeterminate growth in dinosaurs, at least for the taxa identified here, in which channels have been documented as closed or closing over. The new method introduced here provides a phylogenetic tool for definitively distinguishing new ‘dwarf’ species from juveniles of known species. Furthermore, this study confirms the rarity of skeletally mature dinosaurs discovered to date and indicates that we have only begun to witness the full extent of dinosaur growth.Bruce M.

    "abstract": "Large Late Silurian burrows are preserved in fluviatile trough cross-bedded sandstones at Mount Bepcha and Mount William in the Grampians in western Victoria (Australia). These burrows have ventral surfaces with two parallel grooves likely formed by the trace-makers’ paired legs as they burrowed through dunes on braided-river beds, probably after avulsion of sandy channels. The burrows are morphologically distinct from previously described burrows and a new ichnogenus Gariwerdichnus igen. nov. containing a single new ichnospecies G. warreni isp. nov. is erected. The size of the burrows, together with their ridged ventral surface, rounded dorsal surface with large dorsolateral protuberances, and meniscate backfill, point towards giant myriapods as the tracemakers. This conclusion is further supported by the presence of large Diplichnites isp. (including D. gouldi) trackways of comparable size in a stratigraphically higher unit at Mount Bepcha; large D. gouldi are typically attributed to giant myriapods. Early myriapod groups that could have formed G. warreni include eoarthropleurids, arthropleurids, or a Bennettarthra-like organism.Chris Gouramanis [chris.gouramanis@anu.edu.au], Research School of Earth Sciences, The Australian National University, Australian Capital Territory, 0200, Australia; Anthony, J.

    "abstract": "Abundant cone-shaped siliceous microfossils have been recovered from Upper Ordovician black shales of the Wufeng Formation in South China. They occur in the Hirnantian Metabolograptus extraordinarius Biozone. An investigation of their internal structure conducted using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) and transmitted light microscope shows that the specimens are possibly composed of three parts: cephalis, thorax and foot. Robust, longitudinal costae are developed, sometimes branching at the thorax. The geological distribution of these microfossils in South China indicates that they occurred in a restricted epicontinental sea on the Upper Yangtze Platform, which was connected to the open ocean in the north. It seems likely that these microfossils have a limited temporal range relative to the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME) in the early Hirnantian. In the absence of coeval graptolites or other index fossils, their occurrence therefore provides an age marker for the LOME, and has utility for future shale gas exploration in the Wufeng Formation.Xuejin Wu [xjwu@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, PR China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, PR China; *Hui Luo* [huiluo@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, PR China; *Yuandong Zhang [ydzhang@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, PR China; Chao Li [chaoli@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, PR China.",

The colonial rugose corals of the Shishkat fauna (Pragian, Kshtut Formation) from the Zeravshan Mountains are compiled and redescribed according to current taxonomic standards. The fauna can be categorized as a so-called ‘Carlinastraea-Fauna’, and a generally comparable generic composition is recognized on a global scale. Some Silurian relictual genera such as Maikottia or Pycnostylus are recorded. Of the 15 taxa discussed, Australophyllum soghdianum sp. nov. is described. All other specimens are assigned to known species or discussed in the context of open nomenclature. The Shishkat-fauna is clearly dominated by the Ptenophyllina (especially Carlinastraea and Spongophyllum), and Ptenophyllidae (Australophyllum, Xystriphyllum and in particular Lyrielasma). A remarkable occurrence of Vepresiphyllum indicates a weak faunal relation to eastern Australia. All other taxa show close affinities to coeval associations in the Urals, but especially to those from the Turkestan Range and the south Fergana Valley. The treatment of the Fasciphyllidae is supplemented by a short rediscription of the Turkestan Fasciphyllum maikottaense Lavrusevich, 1972 Lavrusevich, A. I. 1972.

Alcheringa.A total of 68 gastropod specimens are reported from the Middle‒Upper Jurassic sedimentary successions exposed at central Saudi Arabia. The studied material comes from the Tuwaiq Mountain and Hanifa formations at the Khashm al Qaddiyah, Dirab, Jabal al Abakkayn and Maáshabah sections. Thirteen species are identified, described and illustrated. Among them, a new Aporrhais species (A. sauditica sp. nov.) is introduced. In addition, two further possible new Pseudomelania species from the same strata are mentioned. Other members of the assemblage include Kosmomphalus? sp. aff. K. reticulatus Fischer, Bourguetia? sp. aff. B. saemanni (Oppel), Bourguetia? sp., Ampullospira sp., Globularia? sp. cf. G. bajociana Fischer, Purpuroidea sp. aff. P. glabra Morris and Lycett, Purpuroidea sp., Cossmannea sp. aff. C. desvoidyi (d’Orbigny), Cryptoplocus sp. aff. C. depressus (Voltz) and Actaeonina? sp. Stratigraphically, seven species of this gastropod assemblage were only reported from the Middle Jurassic, whereas the other six ones are extending from the Middle to the Upper Jurassic of the studied succession. As compared with their gastropod content, the Khashm al Qaddiyah represents the richest section (33 out of 68 specimens, 48.5%), whereas the Maáshabah section showed an impoverished gastropod assemblage (only three specimens, 4.4%). The species reported here show paleobiogeographical affinities with coeval gastropod assemblages from India, east Africa, Middle East (Israel, the Sinai of Egypt) and western Tethys. The identified species confirm three depositional settings: open shelf lagoon, shoal/fore-shoal and open marine environments. The lower degree of fragmentation, poor sorting and scarcity of abrasion indicate a parautochthonous faunal assemblage.Mariel Ferrari [mferrari@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar] Instituto Patagónico de Geología y Paleontología (IPGP-CCT CONICET-CENPAT), Bvd.

Alcheringa 43, 146–156.Nummulites perforatus (N. burdigalensis group) and N. beaumonti (N. discorbinus group) are recorded from a Priabonian limestone outcrop of the Mazyad Member, Dammam Formation, exposed along the eastern limb of Gebel Hafit Anticline, in the United Arab Emirates. Nummulites perforatus at this site is characterized morphologically by lenticular to inflated-lenticular tests with rounded edges, meandering septal filaments, dense granules on, and between, the septal filaments, chambers that are longer than high and a regular-shaped spire. Biometric studies have demonstrated that this new material from the United Arab Emirates is similar to specimens of N. perforatus previously described. N. beaumonti is here characterized morphologically by lenticular tests with slightly rounded peripheries, a relatively thick and irregular marginal cord, compact septal filaments that are curved initially but become radial and twisted around the polar area with a slight flexure towards the periphery, tight to lax coiled spire, and chambers that are rectangular in shape and higher than long, including a rudimentary polar pustule.

Alcheringa 43, 441–448. ISSN 0311-5518.Fuziidae is a significant cockroach family reported only from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation of northeastern China. Male Fuziidae with forceps-like cerci are unique in the 320 Ma history of cockroaches. Longifuzia pectinata gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Jiulongshan Formation based on four male specimens. It can be distinguished from other fuziids by its larger body size, extremely long telescopic abdomen, numerous forewing veins, characteristic coloration on the forewing and unique male genitalia. Three of four type specimens have asymmetric venation in the wings. The narrow and elongate body shape is suggestive of alternative, non-standard diets because a wide (fat) body is necessary for nitrogen fixation in cockroaches. Nevertheless, well-developed male tergal glands provide evidence of nuptial female feeding on nitrogen provisions.

Many of the slabs have preserved the cladid, inadunate crinoid Jimbacrinus bostocki in large numbers, with densities of 150 individuals or more per square metre. Articulated crowns with complete or partial stems attached are often haphazardly aggregated in pods. Details on the morphology of J. bostocki are provided, particularly on juveniles which have cirriferous stems. Adult stems lack any obvious holdfast and are acutely geniculate below the calyx before being preferentially directed linearly in the homocrinid (E–BC) symmetry plane in the E ray direction. Crowns are commonly preserved with their arms arranged in a protective manner, also referred to as the 'trauma' posture. It is inferred that such individuals were likely transported alive by storm induced turbidity currents from a feeding position on a marine shelf to deeper, possibly more anoxic, waters, often accumulating en masse in syndepositional lows such as swales. They were subsequently smothered by sediment and rapidly buried. These fossiliferous deposits are interpreted as an \"obrution\" Lagerstätte. Using taphonomic and functional morphology analysis, possible options for the feeding posture of J. bostocki are proposed. Because of its advanced arm morphology comprising mainly oblique muscular articulations between brachials, the question whether adults were motile, rather than sessile, is addressed.",

This locality is significant because extant species of Bothriembryon from the Nullarbor are confined to within 50 km of the coastline. Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to compare the Nullarbor Bothriembryon species with a morphologically comparable extant species from the Eucla Basin, Bothriembryon barretti, and geographically closest fossil species: Bothriembryon kremnobates and Bothriembryon praecursor. Results showed strong support for a new fossil species herein described as Bothriembryon pilkiensis sp. nov. Specimens were found as internal moulds within pisolitic calcrete overlying the early Miocene Colville Sandstone. The chronology of the pisolitic calcrete is poorly studied; here we discuss the results of palynological and U–Th disequilibrium investigations which attempted to constrain the time of deposition and fossilization, with palynology results suggesting the late Pliocene. The type locality of B. praecursor, Kangaroo Well, Northern Territory, was also re-evaluated in age to the early Miocene, using biocorrelation of two balbarid species to taxa found within Riversleigh World Heritage Area assemblages. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:E33B1587-1023-419D-AFE8-11FD8C443A27",

This finding shifts the age of documented mayfly occurrences in Australia back to the early Mesozoic. Warungata peterjelli is attributed to Ephemerida based mainly on the presence of wing pads with visible developing ephemeroid venation. Although the preservation of W. peterjelli does not allow a precise phylogenetic placement of the taxon, it does exhibit some affinity with stem-group mayflies based on its well-developed metathorax, which resembles Palaeozoic lineages with homonomous wing pairs. https://zoobank.org/3C5EF6DE-9424-47EE-8D2A-B8E591A225EA",

Each main stage of processing has been ascribed to distinct bromalite subgroups, such as cololites, coprolites, and regurgitalites, with little evidence for transitions between these stages. To expand this limited record, we consider a fossil horseshoe crab—Tachypleus syriacus—from the Cenomanian Hjoula Lagerstätte (Sannine Formation, Lebanon) that showcases one such transition. The specimen illustrates a bromalite both within the animal's guts (cololite) and as expelled faecal matter (coprolite). This demonstrates a link between these two conditions for fossil chelicerates and highlights the level of exceptional preservation within the Hjoula Lagerstätte. Additionally, the specimen features prosomal nodules unique to limulids, suggesting new automorphic morphologies for T. syriacus.",

The terapaiensis-group and scabra-group are considered synonymous, while the longicornuta-group and strabonis-group are retained. Linguaphillipsia exhibits a restricted palaeogeographical distribution around the tropical Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, together with the shallow marine margins of eastern Gondwana (Australia). During the Tournaisian, 15 species of Linguaphillipsia ranged across what is now Europe, Asia, and eastern Australia, each showing distinct provincialism. This distribution persisted into the Viséan, although the number of species decreased, particularly in eastern Palaeo-Tethys of Asia. The genus did not survive to the end of the Mississippian. In addition, we describe a new species, Linguaphillipsia buchuensis sp. nov., from Bukit Buchu in Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia (East Malaya Block). Based on faunal similarities, we correlate the Bukit Buchu beds with the Charu Formation in Pahang and assign the unit a Viséan (middle Mississippian) age.",

Satpuraphyllum furcatum is documented from the upper Barakar Formation (Kungurian) of central India and is the oldest known peltasperm from the core regions of Gondwana.

Specimens were collected from 14 beds across the Wuke section and include 18 species representing 17 genera of predominantly atrypides, strophomenides, chonetides and spiriferides. We evaluated the taxonomic diversity of this typically Silurian fauna using principal component analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and network analysis with a heatmap to visualize abundance data. Two associations were identified a Nalivkinia elongata–Megaspinochonetes subrectangularis assemblage from the lower Wuke section; and a Nalivkinia magna–Howellella shiqianensis assemblage from the upper Wuke section. These reflect a shallowing trend within the local marine environment that was potentially linked to the Yangtze Uplift of the South China Platform. Assemblage turnover amongst Early Silurian brachiopods from Southwest China was thus probably related to regional bathymetric changes.",

Evolutionary morphological changes in the new genus Duoforisa: implication for classification and habit of the unilocular Foraminifera. Alcheringa 18, 121–134. ISSN 0311-5518. Unlike other unilocular foraminifera, the new genus Duoforisa from the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene possesses a kidney-shaped test with two apertures on its distal ends. It contains two distinct and successional species, both new, and differentiated by their apertural details. In Duoforisa rima the apertures are slit-like, and become radial in the descendant D. diducta. Intermediate forms have transitional apertural configurations between the slit type and radial type, accompanied also by a change of the test outline from subtriangular to compactly U-shaped. The evolution of the lineage occurred during a period of enhanced upwelling in the Early Miocene and it was terminated just before the global warming at the Early-Middle Miocene boundary. This example suggests evolution of the unilocular foraminifera through successional morphological changes in test shape and in the aperture. Unilocular taxa have tended to flourish or speciate in cool or upwelling environments. Their contraction in the latest Early Miocene to early Middle Miocene was probably due to global warming and well oxygenated conditions which were widespread in the neritic domains of southern Australia.

    "abstract": "Abstract The modern history of collection and study of corals in the Permian strata of Timor began in 1911,with a German expedition (J.Wanner, leader) and a Dutch expedition (H. Molengraaff, leader) to collect Permian and Triassic fossils in the colony of Netherlands Timor, and with a survey by the Swiss geologist F. Weber the same year in Portuguese Timor, the eastern portion of the island. Later expeditions led by Jonker (1916) and Brouwer (1937), both of the Netherlands, greatly increased already huge collections of fossils and additionally, understanding of the island's geology. Monographic studies of these coral collections by Gerth (1921), Koker (1924), Schindewolf (1942), Hehenwarter (1951) and Schouppé & Stacul (1955, 1959) have much enhanced the systematic value of these fossil corals, both Rugosa and Tabulata. Locality information and maps containing collecting localities are somewhat scattered (Wanner 1931, Burck 1923, Marez Oyens 1940, Van Bemmelen 1949), but are summarized here. A list of all valid species names(109 Rugosa, 25 Tabulata) is appended to this paper, with type localities and horizon. Serious problems of nomenclature are avoided in this paper by accepting genus names used in Hill (1981), modified by later systematic studies, such as that of Fedorowski (1986), but some unknown number of names in the list of species are to be synonymized, especially since 31 of them are based on a single specimen (e.g. Niermann 1975). The biostratigraphy of these faunas is uncertain, in great part due to the greatest number of corals having been collected from a tectonic mélange sequence in the Baun to Basleo structural region, and additionally because of the purchase of huge numbers of fossils from the indigenous people of Timor, with accompanying uncertainties regarding locality and horizon data. The coral fauna of Permian age from Timor needs serious restudy to insure its stratigraphic and palaeontologic value, but future study will require new field collection of specimens from the relatively complete stratigraphic sequences in the northern 'Fatu' belt of outcrops. The huge numbers of individuals of some coral species provide great opportunities for understanding population structure in these faunas.

    "abstract": "Permian gastropods from Thailand have been extensively studied over the last few years. The earliest known fossil collection was recovered in 1967 but has never been figured or described. Here, we document this historically important gastropod assemblage excavated from the upper-Lower to Middle Permian Ratburi Group of Khao Mang Lat in the Ban Kao District of Kanchanaburi Province, Central Thailand. The material comprises approximately 200 specimens, almost all of which represent a new species, Peruvispira kanchanaburiensis sp. nov. (Goniasmatidae), together with a single individual of Orthonychia sp. (Orthonychiidae = Platyceratidae). This exceptionally low-diversity community is unusual in comparison to Permian gastropod faunas reported from elsewhere, and could reflect either a low temperature palaeoenvironmental setting or priority effects resulting from early establishment of planktotrophic larvae within the local habitat.Baran Karapunar [karapunar@snsb.de], SNSB-Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und Geologie, Richard-Wagner-Str. 10, 80333 München, Germany, and Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Paleontology & Geobiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Richard-Wagner-Str. 10, 80333 München, Germany; Alexander Nützel [nuetzel@snsb.de], SNSB-Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und Geologie, Richard-Wagner-Str. 10, 80333 München, Germany, and Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Paleontology & Geobiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Richard-Wagner-Str. 10, 80333 München, Germany, and GeoBio-Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Richard-Wagner-Str. 10, 80333 München, Germany; Chatchalerm Ketwetsuriya [ketwetsuriya.c@gmail.com], Department of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University, 10900 Bangkok, Thailand.",

A diverse marine fossil ostracod fauna has been recovered from the Bookpurnong Formation, and is associated with a marine transgression that flooded inland regions of southeastern Australia to form a shallow epicontinental sea. Many of the Bookpurnong Formation ostracods represent immigrant taxa, with species such as Puriana lubbockiana, evidencing a subtropical range expansion of thermophilic warm water forms into southern mid-latitudes. We attribute this to warm plumes from the East Australian Current, which would have impacted southeastern Australia at that time. In general, the Bookpurnong Formation ostracod assemblages indicate low to moderate energy shallow offshore palaeoenvironments subject to warm-temperate and subtropical conditions.

The distribution of S. borealis suggests that this species might have inhabited a spectrum of environments, but it was palaeobiogeographically restricted to the tropical zone, possibly because of sea water temperature sensitivity. This study provides a new description of this species and redefines its constituent element types comprising a seximembrate apparatus. This is characterized by a pastinate Pa element and modified angulate Pb element. Stiptognathus borealis is morphologically most closely related to the genus Fahraeusodus.

There is no evidence for the Late Devonian porolepiform Holoptychius that was previously associated with the tetrapod Metaxygnathus at this site. Scales and a partial articulated specimen of Holoptychius sp. from the Famennian Worange Point Formation at Eden on the New South Wales south coast are close to both Holoptychius sp. from East Greenland and Holoptychius nobilissimus from Scotland. However, evidently a species other than Holoptychius sp. is represented by scales in the Hunter Siltstone at Grenfell, central New South Wales. The Jemalong fossils share character states with other scales from Grenfell and Bogan Gate that show features resembling coelacanth scales; a scale attributed to the Devonian coelacanth Gavinia is shown here for comparison. An isolated tooth plate demonstrates a second lungfish taxon at Jemalong, in addition to the denticulate Soederberghia sp. There is insufficient evidence for referring the skull of Soederberghia to the type species Soederberghia groenlandica. Incomplete placoderm remains suggest that a new antiarch taxon may occur at Jemalong. This new evidence suggests that the age of the Jemalong assemblage should be revised downwards to Givetian–Frasnian or older, rather than Famennian as previously interpreted.",

    "abstract": "Based on shell microstructure, pelagic tentaculitids have been affiliated with molluscs in the past. Species of the genus Styliolina were among the most important pelagic tentaculitids in the Devonian. The shell wall of Styliolina clavulus is single-layered and composed of thin calcareous lamellae that are parallel to the wall of the shell. The thickness of individual lamellae varies about two times but the thickness of each lamella in the shell wall is constant. The structure is clearly laminar and is similar to bryozoan, brachiopod and molluscan calcitic regularly foliated structures. Based on the structure of S. clavulus alone and the reinterpretation of published SEM images, it is impossible to rule out molluscan affinities for styliolinids, as both regularly foliated and semi-nacreous structures are known in molluscs. However, considering the whole shell structure spectrum of tentaculitoids, one should conclude that the structure of S. clavulus fits well within the group of tentaculitoids and lophophorates in general. The biomineralization of styliolinids was likely advanced and organic matrix controlled; the secreting epithelium was located within the shell and secretion likely took place lamella by lamella.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Skull bones in early lungfish contain permanent insignia of the sensory lines of the head, but osteological evidence of sensory lines in derived lungfish is reduced to foramina for nerves to neuromasts, superficial grooves, or elevated ridges on some bones. This is particularly evident in anterior bones, making definition of these bones difficult, and creating problems for phylogenetic analyses. Despite a close association of the sensory lines with the bones of the developing skull in the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, few traces of the lines remain in the bones of the adult animal. Among derived dipnoans, Mioceratodus, a genus of neoceratodont fossil lungfish from Tertiary deposits in central and northern Australia, is unusual because traces of the supraorbital sensory line are retained in the anterior skull roofing bones of large specimens. Equivalent traces are absent from the rostral bones of N. forsteri, and from small specimens of Mioceratodus. The supraorbital sensory line grooves in Mioceratodus bones pass over the posterior surface of the rostral bone, and not the anterior process as in Neoceratodus. The rostral bones of Mioceratodus may be formed from the fusion of different bones in the primitive dipnoan skull compared with those that formed the rostral (EQ) bone of N. forsteri. Alternatively, the association between sensory lines and skull bones may not be constant. Key words: neoceratodont lungfishsensory linesskull bonesfossilRecent dipnoan",

Botanically orientated investigations displayed an increasing use of the electron microscope. Interpretations of palaeoecology and reproductive biology of fossil plants gained increasing momentum. Biostratigraphic studies underwent some new activation but generally took second place to the amount of morphological work. The number of palaeobotanists who completed or received their training during the decade augurs well for the future; there is still much to be done.",

A new shallow shelf species, Monalaria poliveta n. sp., described herein from the Five Forks Glauconitic Sands Member of the Kauru Formation dated as Mangaorapan to Heretaungan in age (late early to early middle Eocene, c. 55–50 Ma), is the oldest recorded member of the genus.

Stage, middle middle Eocene), and M. concinna (Suter, 1917) (Bortonian Stage, late middle Eocene), after which time it became extinct along with several other molluscan groups. These taxa show a strong affinity with the latest Cretaceous struthiolariid, Conchothyra marshalli (Trechmann, 1917), from Haumurian (Campanian?-Maastrichtian) deposits of the South Island. Conchothyra marshalli is the most likely candidate to be the progenitor of the Monalaria stock, despite a gap of approximately 10 Ma in the fossil record of these two biostratigraphically significant groups.",

ISSN 0311-5518The operculate coral Calceola gervillei Bayle, Citation1878 is described for the first time on the basis of the type material from the Cotentin region of Normandy (North Armorican Domain), from Early Devonian (likely upper Lochkovian to lower Pragian) strata, and is chosen as the type species of the monotypic new genus Gerviphyllum. The new genus is also present in the l'Armorique Formation (lower Pragian) of the Plougastel Peninsula (Central Armorican Domain) as Gerviphyllum sp. cf. G. gervillei. One locality in the upper Emsian (Polygnathus serotinus Conodont Zone) Le Fret Formation, on the northern coast of the Crozon Peninsula, has yielded operculate coral specimens described here as ?Chakeola sp., the first (tentative) record of the genus outside eastern Australia, south China and Vietnam. The operculate coral Calceola collini sp. nov. is described from six localities in the early Middle Devonian (Eifelian: Polygnathus costatus Conodont Zone) Saint-Fiacre Formation of the Plougastel and Crozon Peninsulas (Central Armorican Domain), despite the fact that knowledge of the internal characters, especially of the operculum, of the type species Calceola sandalina is very limited. From an extensive review of published references to Calceola from France, we conclude that only the record of Collin (Citation1929) is valid.Anthony Wright (tony.wright@optusnet.com.au), GeoQuEST Research Centre, School of Earth & Environmental Sciences, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia; Yves Plusquellec (yves.plusquellec@univ-brest.fr) and Rémy Gourvennec (remy.gourvennec@univ-brest.fr), Université de Bretagne Occidentale, CNRS-UMR 6538 'Domaines océaniques', Laboratoire de Paléontologie, UFR Sciences et Techniques, 6 avenue Le Gorgeu, CS 98837, F-29283, Brest, France.

New specimens of Glossograptus acanthus from the Ningkuo Shale of China, preserved in relief, help to resolve the much debated problem of the structure of Glossograptus. A model for the proximal structure of the genus is proposed, based on the new material and on Finney's (1978) Athens Shale specimens. The model confirms that Glossograptus has homologous structure and development with Pseudisograptus, and isograptid development type is primitive for the group containing both genera. A cladogram is presented in which the suborder Glossograptina Jaanusson (with families Glossograptidae and Cryptograptidae) together with family Corynoididae Bulman are subsumed within a redefined family Glossograptidae.",

An articulated exoskeleton found recently from southwestern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, South China reveals that these two genera are congeneric, and Chencunia is a junior synonym of Archikainella. The new finding also indicates that Metaacidaspis is a junior synonym of Archikainella. This new articulated material is assigned to the previously described species Archikainella vomerinus.

Here, we substantially increase this diversity by recording the ophiuroids Ophiocoma sp. and Ophiothrix sp., together with irregular echinoids including an immature indeterminate neognathostome, Abertella sp., Amplaster alatus, and Amplatser ellipticus. This revised taxonomic richness is concordant with a warm-water shoreface depositional environment. Our new records of Amplaster and Monophoraster represent the most northerly occurrences of their known geographic range. Likewise, we extend the Argentine distribution of Abertella some 1500 km further north, and identify the first upper Miocene example of the genus. The Argentine Paraná Formation echinoderm assemblage is thus similar to that from the coeval Camacho Formation of Uruguay.Sergio Martínez* [smart@fcien.edu.uy], Universidad de la República Facultad de Ciencias, Iguá 4225, 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay; Leandro M.

During an ongoing revision of the Paraná Formation fauna of Argentina, the taxonomic status of Mactra bonariensis Philippi, 1893, was reassessed. The morphological characters of M. bonariensis provided in the original description and illustration do not allow clear delimitation of the species. The absence of type material of this species, coupled with difficulties in resampling the type locality due to urbanization, necessitates designation of a neotype. No records of this taxon were found in palaeontological and malacological collections. However, material collected from the Paraná Formation at ‘La Juanita’ (Entre Ríos, Argentina) comes from beds equivalent to those exposed at the locality from which Philippi described the original material. As this species may be confused with Quaternary and extant species from the region, a redescription is provided and a neotype designated.",

    "abstract": "Examination of small bioherms in the Early Pennsylvanian Morrow Series of northeastern Oklahoma makes possible better understanding of the changes in structure and composition of organic mounds through time during the Carboniferous of North America. Three phases of biohermal development are described: initiation and stabilization of the substrate by blue-green algae, diversification and habitation of the bioherms by a variety of organisms, and domination by encrusting bryozoans or blue-green algae with termination of mound growth. Three assemblages of organisms may be recognised and include an unusual cavity association. Comparison of the bioherms with modern patch reefs enables greater understanding of the significance of modern and fossil assemblages developed on a carbonate mud substrate.",

A large number of specimens of the trilobite Pseudoblackwelderia lubrica were collected from the Guzhangian (later Cambrian) Changhia Formation at Fenghuangshan in northern Anhui, China, prompting a redefinition of the species. Our emended diagnosis includes: a cone-shaped glabella that is broadly to acutely rounded anteriorly; three pairs of glabellar furrows; the preglabellar field being absent or very short; the librigena with a narrow lateral border, a broad general field and long genal spine; the pygidium with four rings and a terminal piece on the axis; six or seven pairs of pygidial spines with the anterior five pairs being short, the posterolateral pair being long and stout, the seventh pair being small or absent. The new specimens suggest that Neimengguasps is a junior synonym of Pseudoblackwelderia. Moreover, the presence or absence of paired spines on the posterior margin of pygidium is attributed to potential sexual dimorphism.Qianping Lei [cicelyapple@126.com], Nature Department, Changzhou Museum, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, 213022, PR ChinaQing Liu [qingliu1029@yeah.net], Room 104, Unit A, Building Six, Fenghuanghu No. 1, Xinbei District, Changzhou 213125, PR ChinaShanchi Peng [scpeng@nigpas.ac.cn], State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing 210008, China; Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China.",

    "abstract": "At a time of widespread concern over the prevalence of viruses and infectious diseases in global ecosystems, it is helpful to consider the history of afflictions in the geological record. Amongst captive species of Australian kangaroos, one of the most common pathological conditions observed is the occurrence of ‘lumpy jaw’, or Macropod Progressive Periodontal Disease (MPPD). Macropods (including both kangaroos and wallabies) affected by the disease commonly exhibit osteological swellings in either the mandible or maxilla, or both, including in areas surrounding the cheek teeth. Diseased individuals struggle to eat, often resulting in death. The specific cause of MPPD is unclear, although it may be multifactorial. When present in wild populations, the condition is more likely to occur in situations that result in the mass-gathering of individuals around critical resources such as drying waterholes. Here we report a case of MPPD in a Pliocene (ca 3 Ma) kangaroo, the geologically oldest record of this condition within macropods. The fossil is identified as Osphranter ?pan and was excavated from a deposit in the Chinchilla Sand, southeast Queensland. The osteomyelitis is expressed by a noticeable lateral mandibular swelling on the horizontal ramus; this is clearly pathological and has not been observed in any other member of the species. The specific circumstance that led to the development of MPPD in this individual likely reflects palaeoenvironmental stress, principally drought, in the Pliocene ecosystem. Lumpy jaw is evidently a geologically young disease, with its higher incidence through the late Cenozoic closely tied to long-term shifts towards progressively drier and more arid conditions. Given predictions that future climate change will follow such trajectories across many regions of Australia, MPPD is expected to become an increasingly important pathology for management in extant populations. This includes conservation projects that may lead to resource-limited settings such as fenced (including re-wilding) and translocated island populations.Gilbert J.

The ostracods are preserved in sandstone and mudstone as natural moulds. There are two distinct biofacies identified within the Norton Gully Sandstone: one dominated by ornate ostracods belonging to Bungonibeyrichia; and the other by smooth species of Bairdiocypris. We also conclude that most southeast Australian species previously placed in Velibeyrichia are more appropriately placed in Bungonibeyrichia on the basis of lobe morphology. Consequently, both these genera can be recognized as having discrete Silurian-Devonian palaeobiogeographical distributions, with Velibeyrichia spp. occurring in the shallow seas of Laurentia, while Bungonibeyrichia spp. was restricted to shallow seas around eastern Gondwana.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDiprotodontids, a group of large-bodied wombat-like marsupial herbivores, were broadly distributed in Australasian Cenozoic deposits. While most diprotodontids were terrestrial quadrupeds and are often compared to placental herbivores like rhinoceros and hippopotamuses, the zygomaturine diprotodontid Nimbadon lavarackorum, based on its post-cranial morphology, is thought to have occupied the treetops. Understanding the dietary ecology of N. lavarackorum during the Miocene can help clarify potential motivations for an arboreal lifestyle. Here, we conducted dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of N. lavarackorum specimens from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area and compared them to analogous extant mammals to assess the likelihood that these tree-dwelling marsupials occupied a unique ecological niche during the Miocene in Australia—arboreal megafrugivores. The DMTA of N. lavarackorum (i.e., low anisotropy and high complexity) is most similar to extant mammals that include a high proportion of fruit in their diet and is inconsistent with and statistically distinct from obligate folivores. Stable carbon isotopes of N. lavarackorum also indicate the consumption of C3 food sources, consistent with the consumption of 13C enriched fruit in a C3 forest environment. Fruits may have been a motivation for this ca 70 kg marsupial moving into or staying in the treetops—an ecological niche that is currently unoccupied in Australia today.Larisa DeSantis [larisa.desantis@vanderbilt.edu], Department of Biological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37240, USA; Michael Archer [m.archer@unsw.edu.au], Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia; Karen Black [k.black@unsw.edu.au], Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia; Suzanne Hand [s.hand@unsw.edu.au], Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia; Vera Korasidis [vera.korasidis@unimelb.edu.au], Department of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3010, Australia.Keywords: Cenozoicdental microweardietmammalpalaeoecologyRiversleighstable isotopes AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank all museum staff, curators, and collection managers who assisted with access to this material at the American Museum of Natural History and Queensland Museum.

This is the first definitive biostratigraphic evidence for rocks of an Iverian (Jiangshanian) age in the Amadeus Basin. Correlation is made with the Chatsworth Limestone (=Gola beds) of the neighbouring Georgina Basin in Australia, as well as internationally to China, based on the generic occurrence. The biostratigraphic age of the unit is also supported by previous carbon isotope chemostratigraphy, further strengthening the interpretation.",

This lack of data has led to uncertainty regarding their diversity and geographical distribution during this key interval of the Phanerozoic. Here, we report ostracod fossils from the Rong Kwang-Ngao highway section in northern Thailand, type locality for Upper Triassic (Carnian) Kang Pla Formation of the Lampang Group. The studied material comprises almost 100 specimens, most representing a new species, Judahella kangpla sp. nov., which is the first to be formally described from the Upper Triassic of Thailand. The morphology of Judahella kangpla, together with its diagnostic normal pore pattern and sexual dimorphism are discussed. The stratigraphical and geographical distribution of Judahella from the Upper Permian to Upper Triassic is summarized. Although preliminary, our work adds significant information to the biodiversity of marine ostracods during the Triassic along the eastern Tethyan coast.",

ISSN 0311-5518.An extensive collection of isolated tooth plates and skull bones of a lungfish is described from the early Carboniferous mid-Viséan Ducabrook Formation from Ducabrook, in the Drummond Basin, east central Queensland. This species of lungfish, Ctenodus boudariensis, only about one metre in length, was small compared with members of the genus from the Northern Hemisphere. Many characters of the head of C. boudariensis are reminiscent of the skull of the living Australian lungfish, such as the lack of bone around the olfactory organ, and the presence of exoccipital bones embedded in the chondrocranium, although C. boudariensis has gular bones in the mandible, where the living species has scales. The skull has paired E and C bones, a single D bone perforated by a foramen for the pineal organ and a large unpaired B bone flanked by tabular bones with attachment sites for the epaxial muscles of the trunk. The tooth plates, while similar to those of European genera of Ctenodus, were narrower and had fewer ridges. This record extends the incidence of Ctenodus of the classic form, common in Carboniferous and Permian deposits in Europe and also recorded from localities of similar age in North America, to eastern Australia.Anne Kemp [annerkemp@gmail.com], Queensland Museum, Hendra Annexe, 122 Gerler Road, Hendra, Queensland 4011, Australia.",

    "abstract": "This study adds new data to complete the taxonomic revision of arthrodire placoderms from the Early Devonian of the Prague Basin (Czech Republic). It focuses on re-describing arthrodire specimens from the Emsian strata published more than a hundred years ago and associating them with unpublished material. The observations contradict previous taxonomic determinations of the Emsian arthrodires, which distinguished four species of three genera. Only one new genus and species is recovered—Johannaspis bohemicus (Barrande, 1872). The previous taxonomic splitting of the material into various genera is explained as a factor of specific taphonomical preservation in different localities of the Prague Basin. Another factor enabling the artificial splitting was the present location of the material in different institutions around the world. Together with Antineosteus rufus Vaškaninová & Kraft, 2014 based on previously unpublished specimens, they are the only two placoderm species known from the Emsian of the Prague Basin. Both are assigned to the homostiid arthrodires—large suspension feeders. The abundance of the Emsian placoderm fauna is very low in the Prague Basin; only a few specimens are known from each locality. However, they occur in a number of localities of Emsian age in the Prague Basin and in different environments, from very shallow (A. rufus) to relatively deeper marine environments, with all the occurrences being in limestones. The palaeogeographical distribution of homostiid arthrodires in the late Early Devonian was limited to tropical and subtropical shallow marine environments mainly in the southern hemisphere. In the Middle Devonian, the homostiids are no longer recorded from the northern continental margin of Gondwana including the Prague Basin area. However, they appear in Laurussia, Siberia and eastern Gondwana. The disappearance of environments with abundant food resources favourable for these large suspension feeders in the Prague Basin area could be related to the narrowing of the Rheic Ocean and gradual emerging of dry land as an early manifestation of the proceeding Variscan orogeny. This specific local palaeogeographical development of the Prague Basin area is considered the main reason for the significant decrease in diversity and abundance of placoderm fauna, which is in contradiction to the general trend.Valéria Vaškaninová [va.vaska@gmail.com], Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Albertov 6, Prague, 128 43, Czech Republic.",

Here, we describe a partial lower jaw of a fossil chelonioid from the late Miocene of Paraná city, in the Entre Ríos Province of Argentina.

    "abstract": "The ophiuroid Bronthaster retus gen. et sp. nov. is described from a single specimen preserved as external dorsal and ventral moulds, and is assigned to the Protasteridae. It occurs in the Namurian (Levipustula levis Zone) Yagon Siltstone of the Myall Lakes district of central coastal New South Wales. This rock unit forms part of the structurally designated Myall Block at the southeastern coastal termination of the Tamworth Belt. This new genus is the first stelleroid to be described from the Carboniferous in Australia. Most distinctive of the new genus is the arrangement of many small, subrhomboidal to subpentagonal, overlapping ossicles on the dorsal surface of the arms. The clearly exhibited tight relationship between successive ambulacrals in one column in ventral view suggests that some revision of previously inferred relationships within ambulacral columns in protasterids is required. The position of prominent toehooks on each ambulacral ossicle shows that they functioned to prevent lateral movement of the ambulacral column, operating in conjunction with the strong longitudinal musculature to allow arm flexure in the horizontal plane. This feature could potentially identify, within the Protasteridae, an evolutionary lineage that proceeded through the middle Palaeozoic and maintained the linear arrangement of the ambulacral columns using the toehooks, rather than fusion of the ambulacral ossicles across the arm axis.Peter A.

We obtained detrital zircon dates from tuffaceous shales bearing Ediacaran fossils, including Corumbella, Persimedusites, ?Kimberella, ?Cloudina, and Namalia-like forms, together with a single metazoan holdfast structure from the Dargazin area of the Koushk region that correlates with the upper part of the Wedge succession dated at 555 ± 14 Ma. Zircon grains of the tuffaceous siltstones containing Corumbella, Persimedusites, ?Kimberella, ?Cloudina, Namalia-like structures, ?Spriggina, ?Pteridinium, holdfasts and algae-like branching structures in the Wedge section of the Koushk area, produced an age of 581 ± 9 Ma, whereas pyroclastic sandstones bearing Corumbella, Persimedusites, a possible holdfast, ?Pteridinium, ?Cloudina, algae-like branched structure, possible trace fossils and marine algal remains in the Chahmir area yielded an age of 541 ± 5 Ma. Zircon dates from the Dargazin and Wedge deposits are of late Ediacaran and Chahmir strata are of a late Ediacaran to early Cambrian age. Ages of the Chahmir sedimentary rocks are close to those from Dargazin. Based on our results, the maximum depositional age of the detrital zircons indicates relatively consistent sedimentation throughout the late Ediacaran and the early Cambrian, ranging from 590 to 530 Ma.Farnoosh Farjandi [ffarjandi@swin.edu.au], Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne (Hawthorn), Victoria 3122, Australia and Department of Geochemical Exploration, Geological Survey of Iran, Tehran, Iran; Patricia Vickers Rich [prich@swin.edu.au], Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne (Hawthorn), Victoria 3122, Australia and School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment, Monash University, Melbourne (Clayton), Victoria 3800, Australia; Ulf Linnemann [ulf.linnemann@senckenberg.de] and Mandy Hofmann [mandy.hofmann@senckenberg.de], Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Sektion Geochronologie, 01109 Dresden, Germany; Massimo Raveggi [massimo.raveggi@monash.edu] and Michael Hall [mike.hall@monash.edu], School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment, Monash University, Melbourne (Clayton), Victoria 3800, Australia; Thomas H.

    "abstract": "Abstract Two genera and nine species of Bolivinellidae occur in the New Zealand fossil record. Bolivinellids live today in low numbers in sandy sediments at inner shelf depths (0 to 60 m) in tropical to warm temperate seas and apparently also did in the past. The earliest New Zealand species is Quasibolivinella taylori (Early Oligocene) which presumably was carried here from southern Australia. It was closely followed by the arrival of three cosmopolitan species—Bolivinella interrupta (Middle Oligocene), B. subrugosa (Middle to Late Oligocene) and B. rugosa (Middle Oligocene to Late Miocene). The endemic Quasibolivinella finlayi n.sp. (Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene) and Bolivinella bensoni n.sp. (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene) probably evolved from Q. taylori and B. rugosa respectively. Cosmopolitan Bolivinella australis is recorded from the Early Miocene of Northland during the New Zealand Tertiary climatic peak. Extrapolation from the distribution of closely-related, modern B. phillippinensis, indicates that seasonal sea surface temperatures at that time were no cooler than 22–27°C. The last two species, B. lilliei n.sp. and B. profolium n.sp., appear to have arrived in New Zealand in the Late Miocene and survived for only a short period. The disappearance of all Bolivinellidae from the New Zealand record in the early Late Miocene is thought to be due to a rapidly cooling climate.",
