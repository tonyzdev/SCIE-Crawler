    "abstract": "This article utilizes Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter to eliminate seismic random noise. This is a novel method for seismic random noise reduction in which SG filter adopts piecewise weighted polynomial via leastsquares estimation. Therefore, effective smoothing is achieved in extracting the original signal from noise environment while retaining the shape of the signal as close as possible to the original one. Although there are lots of classical methods such as Wiener filtering and wavelet denoising applied to eliminate seismic random noise, the SG filter outperforms them in approximating the true signal. SG filter will obtain a good tradeoff in waveform smoothing and valid signal preservation under suitable conditions. These are the appropriate window size and the polynomial degree. Through examples from synthetic seismic signals and field seismic data, we demonstrate the good performance of SG filter by comparing it with the Wiener filtering and wavelet denoising methods.",

    "abstract": "Flooding events are rising across European watercourses because of changing climatic conditions and anthropogenic pressure. To deal with these events, the European Floods Directive requires the development of flood risk management plans regularly updated every 6 years, where areas affected by flood risk and relative management strategies should be identified. Along the Directive, sediment transport and morphological changes in freshwater environments like rivers are only marginally considered, leading to a possibly wrong estimate of the impact of floods in the case of watercourses in which sediment transport represents a fundamental component. Using the Secchia River in Italy as a case study, the paper compares two numerical simulations performed with the freeware iRIC suite, imposing the same boundary conditions but comparing fixed and mobile bed. The obtained results pinpoint the importance of considering sediment transport in drawing flooding scenarios for alluvial sandy rivers. As suggested by this example, for the incoming revisions of the flood risk management plans, forecasted by 2021, water managers should account for the dynamic behaviour of surface watercourses, considering sediments not only as a driver of pollutants but also as a key aspect that shapes the environment and should be considered in modelling future scenarios and drawing associated management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drought, which is defined as a decrease in average rainfall amounts, is one of the most insidious natural disasters. When it starts, people may not be aware of it, which is why droughts are difficult to monitor. Scientists have long been working to predict and monitor droughts. For this purpose, they have developed many methods, such as drought indices, one of which is the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this study, SPI was used to detect droughts, and machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks, random forest, and decision tree, were used to predict droughts. In addition, 3 different statistical criteria, which are correlation coefficient ( r ), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), were used to investigate model performance values. The wavelet transform (WT) was also applied to improve model performance. One of the areas most impacted by droughts in Turkey is the Konya Closed Basin, which is geographically positioned in the center of the country and is among the top grain-producing regions in Turkey. The Apa Dam is one of the most significant water resources in the area. It provides water to many fertile fields in its vicinity and is affected by droughts which is why it was selected as a study area. Meteorological data, such as monthly precipitation, that could represent the region were obtained between 1955 and 2020 from the general directorate of state water works and the general directorate of meteorology. According to the findings, the M04 model, whose input structure was developed using SPI, various time steps, data delayed up to 5 months, and monthly precipitation data from the preceding month (time t − 1), produced the best results out of all the models examined using machine learning algorithms. Among machine learning algorithms, SVM has achieved the most successful results not only before applying WT but also after WT. The best results were obtained from M04, in which SVM with WT was used (NSE = 0.9942, RMSE = 0.0764, R = 0.9971).",

The study provides a new insight into the phenomenon of the past expansion of the drought-affected area as well as evidence of drying trends in a spatiotemporal context. 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month SPEI were considered, representing drought conditions relevant to agriculture and hydrology. The analysis demonstrates that the spatial extent of droughts shows a broad variability. The annual mean of the percentage of the area under drought has witnessed an increase for all three SPEI timescales. This also pertains to the mean area affected by drought over the growing season (April–September). A decreasing trend in the SPEI values indicates an increase in the severity of droughts over the 60-year period in question in an area extending from the south-west to the central part of Poland.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to identify major drought events on the Spanish mainland between 1961 and 2014 by means of two drought indices, and analyze the spatial propagation of drought conditions. The indices applied were the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized evaporation precipitation index (SPEI). The first was calculated as standardized anomalies of precipitation at various temporal intervals, while the second examined the climatic balance normalized at monthly scale, incorporating the relationship between precipitation and the atmospheric water demand. The daily meteorological data from Spanish Meteorological Archives (AEMet) were used in performing the analyses. Within the framework of the DESEMON project, original data were converted into a high spatial resolution grid (1.1 km2) following exhaustive quality control. Values of both indices were calculated on a weekly scale and different timescales (12, 24 and 36 months). The results show that during the first half of the study period, the SPI usually returned a higher identification of drought areas, while the reverse was true from the 1990s, suggesting that the effect from atmospheric evaporative demand could have increased. The temporal propagation from 12- to 24-month and 36-month timescales analyzed in the paper seems to be a far from straightforward phenomenon that does not follow a simple rule of time lag, because events at different temporal scales can overlap in time and space. Spatially, the propagation of drought events affecting more than 25% of the total land indicates the existence of various spatial gradients of drought propagation, mostly east–west or west–east, but also north–south have been found. No generalized episodes were found with a radial pattern, i.e., from inland to the coast.",

    "abstract": "The issue of trend detection in long time series of river flow records is of vast theoretical interest and considerable practical relevance. Water management is based on the assumption of stationarity; hence, it is crucial to check whether taking this assumption is justified. The objective of this study is to analyse long-term trends in selected river flow indices in small- and medium-sized catchments with relatively unmodified flow regime (semi-natural catchments) in Poland. The examined indices describe annual and seasonal average conditions as well as annual extreme conditions—low and high flows. The special focus is on the spatial analysis of trends, carried out on a comprehensive, representative data set of flow gauges. The present paper is timely, as no spatially comprehensive studies (i.e. covering the entire Poland or its large parts) on trend detection in time series of river flow have been done in the recent 15 years or so. The results suggest that there is a strong random component in the river flow process, the changes are weak and the spatial pattern is complex. Yet, the results of trend detection in different indices of river flow in Poland show that there exists a spatial divide that seems to hold quite generally for various indices (annual, seasonal, as well as low and high flow). Decreases of river flow dominate in the northern part of the country and increases usually in the southern part. Stations in the central part show mostly 'no trend' results. However, the spatial gradient is apparent only for the data for the period 1981–2016 rather than for 1956–2016. It seems also that the magnitude of increases of river flow is generally lower than that of decreases.",

The main purpose of this work was to evaluate current conditions of the landslide in Brzozówka, near Cracow (Poland), and analyzing how different saturations of soil influence the stability of the landslide. The combination of geophysical and geotechnical research, such as electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), cone penetration testing, drilling and laboratory tests as well as a comprehensive analysis of their results, provided reliable information on the geological structure and geotechnical parameters of the landslide. The results were used in numerical simulations of the landslide stability, in which a two-phase model (soil and water) was assumed that included the effective soil strength parameters and the transient flow conditions as well as a partial saturation zone. The sliding surface obtained from the numerical modeling was almost flat, which was confirmed by the ERT method. It was proved that the landslide occurred when the saturation of the upper part of the slope exceeded 0.8. Obtained results are useful for engineering practice.",

The range of temperature to which the sandstone specimens have been exposed is 25–850°C, in a heating furnace. It has been shown that below 300°C, porosity and wave velocity change very little. Above 300°C, there is a rapid increase in porosity, but the wave velocity decreases significantly. The results of thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) suggest that a series of changes occurred between 400 and 600°C in sandstone could be responsible for the different patterns of variation in porosity and wave velocity.",

The study makes use of a set of 43 long time series of observation records from the stations in Poland, from 1952 to 2013. To describe temporal changes in snow cover characteristics, the intervals of 1952–1990 and of 1991–2013 are compared and trends in analysed data are sought (e.g., using the Mann–Kendall test). Observed behaviour of time series of snow-related variables is complex and not easy to interpret, for instance because of the location of the research area in the zone of transitional moderate climate, where strong variability of climate events is one of the main attributes. A statistical link between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and the snow cover depth, as well as the number of snow cover days is found.",

The second main shock (MW6.0) occurred on 3 February on an adjacent fault segment, where the aftershock distribution was remarkably sparse, evidently encouraged by stress transfer of the first main shock. The aftershocks from the regional catalog were relocated using a 7-layer velocity model and station residuals, and their distribution evidenced two adjacent fault segments striking almost N-S and dipping to the east, in full agreement with the centroid moment tensor solutions, constituting segments of the Kefalonia Transform Fault (KTF). The KTF is bounded to the north by oblique parallel smaller fault segments, linking KTF with its northward continuation, the Lefkada Fault.",

Eight \"twinned\" catchments in Poland and Norway serve as case studies. We present the procedures of the catchment selection applied in Norway and Poland and a database consisting of near-natural ten Polish and eight Norwegian catchments constructed for the purpose of climate impact assessment. Climate projections for selected catchments are described and compared with observations of temperature and precipitation available for the reference period. Future changes based on those projections are analysed and assessed for two periods, the near future (2021–2050) and the far-future (2071–2100). The results indicate increases in precipitation and temperature in the periods and regions studied both in Poland and Norway.",

    "abstract": "Eastern Ohio is an area of North America where a significant increase in seismicity rate was noted in the early 2010s. This increase has been associated with intensification of unconventional gas extraction performed in the Appalachian Basin and has been directly linked to two processes: hydraulic fracturing and disposal of the associated wastewater. In this paper, we review the recent seismicity in the Appalachian Basin including various episodes of induced seismicity that were temporally and spatially linked to operational activity, and we have performed some comparable analyses on the most recent sequences. The activities have not been as pervasive as other areas of North America, such that the cases are typically isolated and provide opportunities to study the seismogenic process in detail. The observed seismicity is concentrated in a narrow corridor that extends north–south in eastern Ohio and into central West Virginia, perhaps due to differences in operational targets and geologic variations. Ohio appears to have a higher prevalence of seismicity induced by wastewater disposal than surrounding states, but this is based on limited number of cases. Ohio also has an order of magnitude higher prevalence of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing than surrounding states, and prior work has suggested this is due to the targeting of the deeper Utica–Point Pleasant formation in Ohio that is closer to basement rocks than the Marcellus formation in West Virginia or Pennsylvania. In areas where hydraulic fracturing has induced seismicity, the percentage of stimulated wells that produce detectable seismicity is approximately 10–33%. Detailed studies of induced seismicity via double-difference relocation and focal mechanism analysis have revealed a series of linear fault segments, none of which correspond to previously mapped faults. Yet, the remarkable coherence in their orientation suggests these were preexisting, optimally oriented, and critically stressed. These fault orientations reveal a consistent regional stress field that only varies over a narrow azimuthal range from ~ 50° to 74°. The strongest observed seismic events in Ohio appear to occur in the Precambrian basement and indicate that these rocks have the maturity needed to produce M > 2 earthquakes and hence the greater potential hazard.",

This event, of ML = 4.2, was the third most powerful seismic event recorded in the Legnica Głogów Copper District (LGCD). Inhabitants of the area reported that the felt tremor was bigger and lasted longer than any other ones felt in the last couple of years. Analysis of spectral parameters of the records from in-mine seismic system and surface LUMINEOS network along with broadband station KSP record were carried out. The location of the event was close to the Rudna Główna Fault zone; the nodal planes orientations determined with two different approaches were almost parallel to the strike of the fault. The mechanism solutions were also obtained as Full Moment Tensor from P-wave amplitude pulses of underground records and waveform inversion of surface network seismograms. The results from the seismic analysis along with macroseismic survey and observed effects from the destroyed part of the mining panel indicate that the mechanism of the event was complex rupture initiated as thrust faulting on an inactive tectonic normal fault zone. The results confirm that the fault zones are the areas of higher risk, even in case of carefully taken mining operations.",

This plate movement has divided the Himalaya into four parts, viz. Outer Himalaya, Lesser Himalaya, Greater Himalaya, and Tethys Himalaya. The crystalline basement rock plays an imperative role for structural and tectonic association. The study has been carried out near Rishikesh-Badrinath neighborhood in the northwestern part of the Himalayan girdle with multifarious tectonic set up with thrusted and faulted geological setting. In this study area, 3D Euler deconvolution, horizontal gradient analysis, tilt angle (TILT) and horizontal tilt angle (TDX) analysis have been carried out using gravity data to delineate the subsurface geology and heterogeneity in the northwestern part of Himalaya. The Euler depth solutions suggest the source depth of about 12 km and various derivative analyses suggest the trend of the delineation thrust-fault boundaries along with the dip and strike direction in the study area.",

    "abstract": "An integrated Visual Basic Application interface is described that allows for sensitivity analysis, calibration and routing of hydraulichydrological models. The routine consists in the combination of three freeware tools performing hydrological modelling, hydraulic modelling and calibration. With such an approach, calibration is made possible even if information about sewers geometrical features is incomplete. Model parameters involve storage coefficient, time of concentration, runoff coefficient, initial abstraction and Manning coefficient; literature formulas are considered and manipulated to obtain novel expressions and variation ranges. A sensitivity analysis with a local method is performed to obtain information about collinearity among parameters and a ranking of influence. The least important parameters are given a fixed value, and for the remaining ones calibration is performed by means of a genetic algorithm implemented in GANetXL. Single-event calibration is performed with a selection of six rainfall events, which are chosen so to avoid non-uniform rainfall distribution; results are then successfully validated with a sequence of four events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nine hours apart, two catastrophic earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and 7.6) occurred on 6 February 2023, in eastern Türkiye. The mainshocks destroyed several cities and villages in 11 provinces, including Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, Adıyaman, Malatya, Adana and Gaziantep. Over about 50,000 aftershocks were detected in the nine months. Because the resolution of hypocentral locations in the Turkish national earthquake catalogs is limited, about 31,000 events are relocated using the double-difference method in this study. The aftershock distribution and its relation to energy release on the faults and Coulomb stress change areas are investigated. The improved hypocenters give a clearer image to understand the activity on the faults. The event distribution indicates that the rupture of the first mainshock in Pazarcık (Mw 7.8) propagates unilaterally on the northernmost segment of the Dead Sea Fault Zone and then transfers to the East Anatolian Fault Zone at the Maraş Triple Junction. The bilaterally extending rupture causes dense aftershock activity on the fault zone from Samandağ to Pütürge. The second mainshock in Elbistan (Mw 7.6) was triggered because of the positive Coulomb stress change on the Çardak fault, which generates dense clusters at both ends of the fault. It is observed that a high number of aftershocks occur on the low slip patches, and the high-energy release areas have low activity because of the stress equilibrium on the fault surfaces.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to investigate trends in selected hydroclimatic indices using novel and conventional tools, for future climate projections in the twenty-first century. Selected quasi-natural Norwegian and Polish catchments are used as a case study. The projected flows are provided by GR4J rainfall-runoff conceptual model, coupled with an ensemble of climate model projections from EURO-CORDEX initiative. The trends are analysed using conventional Mann–Kendall and modified Mann–Kendall statistical approaches, a time–frequency approach based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) method. Of all methods applied the DHR gives the most conservative trend estimates. Trends depend on the specific hydroclimatic character and flow regime of the catchment. The results confirmed that in catchments with a rainfall-driven flood regime, an increase in the amount of precipitation is followed by increased flows, with strong seasonal changes, whereas, in catchments with a snow-driven flood regime, despite an increase of mean annual flow, decrease in annual maximum flow is observed. Generally, positive trend is the most dominant in all catchments studied and the methods were consistent in detection of trend except in seasonal trend test.",

The erosion rate is proportional to the product of the second moment of the lofted particle size distribution N(D), and third moment of the normalized soil size distribution S(D), divided by the integral of S(D)D^2/v(D), where D is particle diameter and v(D) is the vertical component of particle velocity. The second moment of N(D) is estimated by optical extinction analysis of the Apollo cockpit video. Because of the similarity between mass erosion rate of soil as measured by optical extinction and rainfall rate as measured by radar reflectivity, traditional NWS radar/rainfall correlation methodology can be applied to the lunar soil case where various S(D) models are assumed corresponding to specific lunar sites.",

The third flow unit discriminator was proposed by the author; the model is based on relation between porosity, permeability, irreducible water saturation, and pore size distribution. Also, Wyllie–Rose equation for permeability in tight reservoir was core-calibrated, and coefficients e, d, and Kw were established. The reservoir is built of thin layers of sandstones with variable porosity, permeability, pore sizes, and irreducible water. The research was performed in two wells where as input well log data, the laboratory results of mercury injection porosimetry, permeability measurements, and nuclear magnetic resonance data were used. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the presence of fractures identified on XRMI images were strictly related to one flow unit.",

    "abstract": "This study integrates potential gravity and magnetic field data with remotely sensed images and geological data in an effort to understand the subsurface major geological structures in Afghanistan. Integrated analysis of Landsat SRTM data was applied for extraction of geological lineaments. The potential field data were analyzed using gradient interpretation techniques, such as analytic signal (AS), tilt derivative (TDR), horizontal gradient of the tilt derivative (HG-TDR), Euler Deconvolution (ED) and power spectrum methods, and results were correlated with known geological structures. The analysis of remote sensing data and potential field data reveals the regional geological structural characteristics of Afghanistan. The power spectrum analysis of magnetic and gravity data suggests shallow basement rocks at around 1 to 1.5 km depth. The results of TDR of potential field data are in agreement with the location of the major regional fault structures and also the location of the basins and swells, except in the Helmand region (SW Afghanistan) where many high potential field anomalies are observed and attributed to batholiths and near-surface volcanic rocks intrusions. A high-resolution airborne geophysical survey in the data sparse region of eastern Afghanistan is recommended in order to have a complete image of the potential field anomalies.",

They included: the entropy of monthly river runoff and the entropy of river runoff distribution over time. An analysis of monthly flow series for the years 1951–2010 from 395 gauging stations located on 248 rivers in Poland was performed. This allowed a quantitative determination of the degree of uncertainty of two regime characteristics indirectly establishing the predictability, regularity, and stability of their appearance and their spatial variability. An analysis of relations between the calculated entropy, as well as between the entropy and the classical parameters commonly used was performed in describing the hydrological regime. The obtained grouping of rivers into four categories in terms of entropy of volume and distribution of runoff in the annual cycle clearly coincides with the types of river regime distinguished in Poland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The High Dam is one of the world’s biggest embankments dams. Moreover, the new city of Aswan, which locates on the western side of the Nile River, is one of the cities that was established to overcome the growing population problem. Therefore, the detailed geophysical studies for the active faults are of more importance for assessing the seismic stability for both of them. Indeed, the emergency spillway fault was documented as a normal and inactive fault. While, a moderate earthquake (M L = 4.6) was recorded along this fault in 2010, about 4.5 km away from the Dam. Hence, its activity must be re-evaluated. The seismic activity along the fault and its extension has been studied. The seismicity distributions and the fault plane solution indicate normal faulting with a strike-slip component and shallow focal depth. Moreover, pore pressure and fluid diffusion play an essential role in fault activation process. On the other hand, the magnetic data for the research area was subjected to a detailed analysis. 2D spectrum analysis and 3D Euler deconvolution methods, were used to analyze and interpret the aeromagnetic anomaly data so as to better understand the tectonic framework of the study region. Finally, the integrated geophysical data delineate the trend of the emergency spillway fault which extends NW–SE. This fault could assist in updating the current seismic source model around the High Dam and new Aswan city for evaluating the seismic hazard for both of them.",

The main part of the paper was preceded by an analysis of changes in the start and end dates and the duration of the growing season in Poland in the period 1966–2020. The growing season in Poland is projected to be the shortest in mountain areas and in the north-eastern regions of Poland, where the date of growing season start is the latest and the date of the growing season end is the earliest. Whereas the longest growing season due to the projected earliest start and latest end dates is expected in the southwestern Poland. In the case of the coast, its late end will be of the greatest importance for its duration as a result of the warming effect of the sea in the autumn–winter period. The most intensive changes are forecasted in the long-term perspective in the case of the scenario regarding a high level of greenhouse gas emissions. The forecasts show that outside mountain areas, the growing season duration will vary from less than 255 days in the northeastern regions to more than 290 days in southwest and western Poland. In the duration of the mountains, the growing season will vary from 180 days on Kasprowy Wierch to 188 days on Śnieżka. This suggests significant changes in agroclimatic conditions in Poland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accurately assessing the erodibility of geomaterials is of great significance for the design of earthen structures and the prevention of the associated failure induced by seepage force. Recently, the un-resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics–Discrete Element Method (CFD–DEM) has been widely used to investigate internal erosion. However, due to the use of wall boundary and the fact that the fixed CFD domain cannot be changed with the soil sample’s volume contraction during the erosion test, a larger porosity at the boundary of the CFD domain is commonly formed, resulting in sidewall preferential flow (i.e., relatively more fine particles migrate along the boundary of the DEM domain) and thereby overestimating the soil erodibility. In this study, a new method based on particle boundary is developed to tackle this problem. The newly proposed particle boundary can prevent its particles from erosion via inter-particle bonding and transfer stress from servo walls to the simulated sample. An optimal particle boundary thickness is determined by considering sample contraction and computational efficiency. The performance of the new method was compared with the conventional method and also verified using experimental results. The results show that the newly proposed method has significantly improved the uniformity of fluid velocity distribution. Furthermore, the cumulative eroded mass of fine particles in the new model is approximately 15% lower than in the conventional model. It is convincingly demonstrated that the new method can simulate internal erosion better and give a more accurate assessment of geomaterial erodibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The incremental impacts of climate change on elements within the water cycle are a growing concern. Intricate karst aquifers have received limited attention concerning climate change, especially those with sparse data. Additionally, snow cover has been overlooked in simulating karst spring discharge rates. This study aims to assess climate change effects in a data-scarce karst anticline, specifically Khorramabad, Iran, focusing on temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and Kio spring flows. Utilizing two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), namely SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, extracted from the CMIP6 dataset for the base period (1991–2018) and future periods (2021–2040 and 2041–2060), the research employs Landsat data and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for snow cover and spring discharge computation, respectively. ANNs are trained using the training and verification periods of 1991–2010 and 2011–2018, respectively. Results indicate projected increases in temperature, between + 1.21 °C (2021–2040 under SSP245) and + 2.93 °C (2041–2060 under SSP585), and precipitation, from + 2.91 mm/month (2041–2060 under SSP585) to + 4.86 mm/month (2021–2040 under SSP585). The ANN models satisfactorily simulate spring discharge and snow cover, predicting a decrease in snow cover between − 4 km 2 /month (2021–2040 under SSP245) and − 11.4 km 2 /month (2041–2060 under SSP585). Spring discharges are anticipated to increase from + 28.5 l/s (2021–2040 under SSP245) to + 57 l/s (2041–2060 under SSP585) and from + 12.1 l/s (2021–2040 under SSP585) to + 36.1 l/s (2041–2060 under SSP245), with and without snow cover as an input, respectively. These findings emphasize the importance of considering these changes for the sustainability of karst groundwater in the future.",

No consensus has been reached about subduction polarity in these disputes. So, it is planned to contribute to the subduction polarity debates in geodynamic evolution models by determining the crust and lithosphere structure of the region. Therefore, power spectral analysis, total horizontal derivative, Parker-Oldenburg inversion and isostatic analysis methods have been applied to the satellite gravity data of the studied region. To determine the subduction direction of the oceanic crust, an area has been selected along the Black Sea basin—Anatolia plate. The subduction of the crust has been observed at depths of 30 to 89 km. As a result of this study, it was finalized that the subduction direction of the oceanic crust in the study area is southward.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study hybridizes the new-generation evolutionary algorithms and the nonlinear regression technique for stream temperature modeling and compares this approach with conventional gray and black box approaches under natural flow conditions, providing a comprehensive assessment. The nonlinear equation for water temperature modeling was optimized using biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and invasive weed optimization (IWO), simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Two black box approaches, a feedforward neural network (FNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, were also employed for comparison. Additionally, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) served as a gray box model for river thermal regimes. The models were evaluated based on accuracy, complexity, generality and interpretability. Performance metrics, such as the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), showed that the LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy (NSE = 0.96) but required significant computational resources. In contrast, evolutionary algorithm-based models offered acceptable performance while reducing the computational complexities of LSTM, with all models achieving NSE values above 0.5. Considering interpretability, accuracy and complexity, evolutionary-based nonlinear models are recommended for general applications, such as assessing thermal river habitats. For tasks requiring very high accuracy, the LSTM model is preferred, while ANFIS provides a balanced trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for engineers and ecologists. While all models demonstrate similar generality, this model is developed for a specific location. For other locations, independent models with a similar architecture would need to be developed. Ultimately, the choice of model depends on specific objectives and available resources.",

The research embraced 22 lakes in Poland over the period 1961–2010. Strong relations were found to hold between NAO and individual characteristics of ice phenology. In a negative NAO phase, one can observe a later appearance of ice phenomena and ice cover compared with the average values, ice cover persisting even 30 days longer and being thicker even by more than 10 cm. In turn, in a positive NAO phase the duration of ice phenomena and ice cover is shorter, the cover being less thick and solid. The observed spatial differences in the effect of NAO on the pattern of ice phenomena in Poland show this matter to be fairly complex. The most significant factor changes in climatic conditions, which manifest themselves in the continentality of the climate growing eastwards.",

River Hydromorphological Quality assessment method is presented with a case study of the Biała River, Polish Carpathians, where this assessment was used as basis for a restoration project aimed to establish an erodible river corridor. The results of the assessment revealed significant differences in hydromorphological quality between unmanaged and channelized river cross-sections, indicating channel regulation as a major cause of the hydromorphological degradation of the Biała and confirming the choice of the erodible river corridor as an appropriate method of its restoration. The assessment indicated hydromorphological features of the river that were severely modified within the channelized reaches and which are likely to improve the most with the removal of bank protection and allowing free channel migration.",

In the analysis, the use was made of monthly air temperatures recorded at fifteen meteorological stations, water temperatures of twelve lakes, and Hurrell's winter NAO indices. Over the study period (1971–2010), there was a marked increase in the temperatures of both, air and lake waters. Depending on the NAO phase, water temperatures were observed to depart from mean values, being markedly higher than average (even by 1°C) in the positive winter NAO phase. The differences in water temperatures were statistically significant in the winter-spring season. In turn, in the negative NAODJFM phase lake water temperatures in winter and spring were markedly lower than average (in March even by 1.0°C). The unique response of some lakes depends on their morphometric parameters, including their mean depth.",

However, the practical requirements for taking into account non-stationarity as a support in decision-making procedures exceed the up-to-date development of the theory and the of software. Currently, the most popular and freely available software package that allows for non-stationary statistical analysis is the GAMLSS (generalized additive models for location, scale and shape) package. GAMLSS has been used in a variety of fields. There are also several papers recommending GAMLSS in hydrological problems; however, there are still important issues which have not previously been discussed concerning mainly GAMLSS applicability not only for research and academic purposes, but also in a design practice. In this paper, we present a summary of our experiences in the implementation of GAMLSS to non-stationary flood frequency analysis, highlighting its advantages and pointing out weaknesses with regard to methodological and practical topics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The time-reversal imaging method has become a standard technique for seismic source location using both acoustic and elastic wave equations. Although there are many studies on the determination of the relevant parameter for visualization of the time-reversal method, little has been done so far to investigate the accuracy of seismic source location depending on parameters such as the geometry of the seismic network or underestimation of the velocity model. This paper investigates the importance of the accuracy of seismic source location using the time-reversal imaging method of input variables such as seismic network geometry and the assumed geological model. For efficient visualization of seismic wave propagation and interference, peak-to-average power ratio was used. Identification of the importance of variables used in seismic source location was obtained using the Morris elementary effect method, which is a global sensitivity analysis method.",

Seismic recurrence parameters for all the documented probable sources are established from an updated earthquake catalogue. The contour maps of probable spectral acceleration at 0, 0.2, and 1 s (5% damping) are presented for 475 and 2475 years return periods. Also, the hazard curves and uniform hazard response spectrums are presented for all the important cities in this province. Results indicate that the present codal provision underestimates the seismic hazard at cities of Bilaspur, Shimla, Hamirpur, Chamba, Mandi, and Solan. In addition, regions near Bilaspur and Chamba exhibit higher hazard levels than what is reported in literature.",

We observed crustal thickness of 34–37 km in Timor Island, which is consistent with the previous works. The thick crust (> 30 km) is also found beneath Sumba and Flores Islands, which might be related to the arc-continent collision causing the thickened crust. In Timor and Sumba Islands, we observed high V p /V s ratio (> 1.84) with low velocity zone that might be associated with the presence of mafic and ultramafic materials and fluid filled fracture zone. The high V p /V s ratio observed at Sumbawa and Flores volcanic Islands might be an indication of partial melt related to the upwelling of hot asthenosphere material through the subducted slab.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acoustic Doppler velocimetry profilers (ADVPs) are widely used in both experimental and field studies because of their robustness in velocity measurements. The acquired measurements do not only offer estimates of the local and instantaneous flow velocity at the interrogated measurement volume, but can also be further processed for the estimation of the bed surface shear stresses, thus they are finding a wide range of applications ranging from water engineering to geomorphology and eco-hydraulics. This study aims to evaluate the performance of an ADVP in obtaining hydrodynamics measurements under fixed flow conditions, with various probe configurations. To this goal, a robust search is conducted where ADVP probe settings are sequentially altered. A number of assessment criteria are used including qualitative observations, such as checking the shape of the velocity profile, as well as quantitative error metrics, including signal-to-noise ratio, correlations and number of spikes. Further, estimation of the bed shear stresses computed by means of using the log Law of the Wall and turbulent kinetic energy, allow obtaining a better understanding of the uncertainties involved and the importance of making a better informed choice with respect to the probe configuration settings. Thus, the methodology and performance metrics provided herein, although presented for a given flow, can generally be applied from practitioners and researchers alike.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water scarcity and soil erosion are the main constraints small holder farmers are facing in Tigray, the northern most part of Ethiopia. Both very high and very low precipitation can cause a damage to agriculture which is the case in semi-arid regions like Tigray. While too little rainfall cannot support the growth of crops resulting in crop failure, the short but intense rainfall also causes a runoff thereby washing away essential soil nutrients. Installation of different micro/macro-catchment rainwater harvesting can address both water scarcity and soil erosion if they are properly designed prior to construction. This research was intended to develop a methodology for identifying suitable rainwater harvesting (rwh) sites by using weighted overlay analysis. It also utilizes Ahp (analytical hierarchy process) as effective multi-criterion decision-making tool in eastern Tigray at Kilte Awlaelo district on an area of 1001 km 2 . This method was chosen because it is simple to use, cost effective, flexible and widely adopted. Physical, hydrological, climate and socio-economic aspects were taken into account during criteria selection. The result indicated four suitability classes with 8.74% highly suitable areas (85.25 km 2 ), 56% suitable areas (550.75 km 2 ), 30.8% moderately suitable areas (303.2 km 2 ) and 4.46% less suitable areas (43.87 km 2 ). The produced rwh suitability map was also validated by both ground truth on google earth pro and a field trip to the study site. In situ and ex situ rwh including bench terraces, wells, and exclosure areas were identified during the field visit that verified the suitability model. Finally, depending on weight and scale of criteria and sub-criteria that matched to each identified suitable areas, different micro-catchment and macro-catchment techniques of water harvesting are recommended. This methodology can be utilized as decision-making tool for rwh practitioners, local and foreign organizations working on soil water conservation programmes and policy-makers during their early planning stages.",

The studies were conducted in two study areas that differ significantly in terms of peat thickness. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was used to identify the properties of the peat and its substrate, such as thickness and electrical resistivity. Comparison of the field studies with the laboratory tests has shown that the ash content rises electrical resistivity in peat. In addition, the study has shown that the application of non-invasive geophysical methods in protected areas is justified. The fen, as a medium containing mostly water, was a proper test area for the ERI measurements.",

    "abstract": "Lake waters are a significant source of drinking water and contribute to the local economy (e.g. enabling irrigation, offering opportunities for tourism, waterways for transport, and meeting utility water demands); therefore, the ability to accurately forecast lake water levels is important. However, given the significant lack of research with respect to forecasting water levels in small lakes (i.e. 0.05 km2 < area < 10 km2), the present study sought to address this knowledge gap by testing a pair of hypotheses: (1) it is possible to forecast water levels in small surface lakes using artificial neural networks (ANN), and (2) better water-level forecasts will be obtained when the wavelet transform (WT) is used as an input data pre-processing tool. Based on an analysis of a case study in Lake Biskupinskie (1.16 km2) in Poland and based on a range of model performance statistics (e.g. mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean squared error, coefficient of determination, mean absolute percentage error), both hypotheses were confirmed for monthly forecasting of lake water levels. ANNs provided good forecasting results, and WT pre-processing of input data led to even better forecasts. Additionally, it was found that meteorological variables did not have a significant impact in forecasting water-level fluctuations. In light of the results and the limited scope of the present study, proposed future research directions and problems to be resolved are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Research in the field of anthropogenic seismicity (AS) requires not only seismicity data but also data regarding the progress of the technological/production activities which is the origin of the induced or triggered seismic events. Such data are typically restricted and proprietary, and therefore, usually not available for independent researchers who wish to develop, perform and verify scientific research. The induced seismicity-European plate observing system (IS-EPOS) web portal offers to its user's access to data, applications and documents in order to facilitate AS research. IS-EPOS web portal has been designed to serve as one of the main pillars of the Thematic Core Service—-Anthropogenic Hazards belonging to pan-European multidisciplinary research infrastructure created within the EPOS program. IS-EPOS platform is open for research community and general public according to its rules of access. The platform is operating since January 2016 and is now integrated in the EPOS Integrated Core Services. IS-EPOS e-platform promotes new opportunities to study and comprehend the dynamic and complex solid earth system by integrating the use of multidisciplinary data, data products, analysis models and online applications. The integration of existing and new national and transnational Research Infrastructures increases the access and use of multidisciplinary data recorded by the solid earth observing systems, acquired in laboratory experiments and/or produced by computational simulations. In this paper, we describe the structure and the main innovative characteristics implemented in IS-EPOS. The platform is open to accommodate data integrated within other research projects, and it is continuously being updated with improvements in existing features and implementations of new ones. An appendix at the end of the article provides a summary of acronyms and abbreviations in order to make the reader familiar with the terms used throughout the manuscript.",

The aim was to supply and improve standard well logs interpretation based on machine learning methods, especially ANNs. ANNs were used on standard well logging data, e.g. P-wave velocity, density, resistivity, neutron porosity, radioactivity and photoelectric factor. During the calculations, information about lithology or stratigraphy was not taken into account. We apply different methods of classification: cluster analysis, support vector machine and artificial neural network—Kohonen algorithm. We compare the results and analyse obtained electrofacies. Machine learning method–support vector machine SVM was used for classification. For the same data set, SVM algorithm application results were compared to the results of the Kohonen algorithm. The results were very similar. We obtained very good agreement of results. Kohonen algorithm (ANN) was used for pattern recognition and identification of electrofacies. Kohonen algorithm was also used for geological interpretation of well logs data. As a result of Kohonen algorithm application, groups corresponding to the gas-bearing intervals were found. Analysis showed diversification between gas-bearing formations and surrounding beds. It is also shown that internal diversification in gas-saturated beds is present. It is concluded that ANN appeared to be a useful and quick tool for preliminary classification of members and gas-saturated identification.",

Common assumption is the time-invariant distribution function with time-dependent location and scale parameters while the shape parameters are time-invariant. Here, instead of location and scale parameters of the distribution, the mean and standard deviation are used. We analyse the accuracy of the two methods in respect to estimation of time-dependent first two moments, time-invariant skewness and time-dependent upper quantiles. The method of maximum likelihood (ML) with time covariate is confronted with the Two Stage (TS) one (combining Weighted Least Squares and L-moments techniques). Comparison is made by Monte Carlo simulations. Assuming parent distribution which ensures the asymptotic superiority of ML method, the Generalized Extreme Value distribution with various values of linearly changing in time first two moments, constant skewness, and various time-series lengths are considered. Analysis of results indicates the superiority of TS methods in all analyzed aspects. Moreover, the estimates from TS method are more resistant to probability distribution choice, as demonstrated by Polish rivers' case studies.",

Also, to investigate the potentially anomalous areas more accurately, five additional resistivity profiles were measured by a Combined Resistivity Sounding-Profiling array (CRSP). According to the results of 2-D inversion modelling, a main aqueduct tunnel was detected beneath the central part of the site. Finally, the resistivity pattern of the detected aqueduct system passing the investigated area was provided using the obtained results.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparison of data acquisition, processing and interpretation between passive seismic interferometry (SI) and active multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) methods, both using surface waves for estimation S-wave velocity field. Measurements have been taken in the same geological engineering conditions on Just-Tegoborze landslide on the south of Poland. This comparison study has an important meaning from landslide hazard evaluation point of view. The landslide is located in Magura Nappe in Outer (Flysch) Carpathians. SI was based on registration of local seismic noise generated by high traffic on the state road which intersects the landslide. The main processing step was cross-correlation of seismic noise between every pair of receivers. It led to obtain series of empirical Green's functions for Rayleigh surface wave. However, in MASW method, seismic energy was released by an impact of 5 kg sledgehammer in a metal plate. Both methods included analysis of dispersion curves of Rayleigh surface wave. The inversion of picked fundamental modes was applied using genetic algorithm and resulted in 1D S-wave velocity models. The last step of interpretation included model visualization as the 2D S-wave velocity sections for studied profiles. Both MASW and SI methods allowed to estimate S-wave velocity field in Just-Tegoborze landslide subsurface. Dispersion images obtained from both methods provided similar phase velocity and frequency ranges. On S-wave velocity sections, the greater depth range was observed for SI method; however, lateral resolution was better for MASW. Slip surfaces in colluvial layer were not observed on either SI or MASW S-wave velocity sections. Only results obtained from SI allowed to distinguish probable slip surface located deeper, i.e. on the contact with less weathered flysch bedrock.",

However, despite landscape evolution modelling is based on a rather long tradition, and scientists and practitioners are studying how to schematize the processes involved in the evolution of a landscape since decades, there is still the need for improving the knowledge of the physical mechanisms and their numerical coding. Updating past review papers, the present work focuses on the first aspect, discussing six main components of a landscape evolution model, namely continuity of mass, hillslope processes, water flow, erosion and sediment transport, soil properties, vegetation dynamics. The more common schematizations are discussed in a plain language, pointing out the current knowledge and possible open questions to be addressed in the future, towards an improvement of the reliability of such kind of models in describing the evolution of fluvial landscapes and river networks.",

This paper shows set of laboratory results of the dynamic Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and Biot’s coefficient for dry and water-saturated Istebna sandstone samples under a series of confining pressure conditions at two different temperatures. The predicted results from Wyllie’s equation were compared to the measured ones in order to show the effect of saturation on the rock weakening. A negative correlation has been identified between Poisson’s ratio, Biot’s coefficient and confining pressure, while a positive correlation between confining pressure and Young’s modulus. The predicted dynamic poroelastic rock properties using the P-wave value from Wyllie’s equation are different from measured ones. It shows the important influence of water saturation on rock strength, which is confirmed by unconfined compressive strength measurement. Linear equations have been fitted for the laboratory data and are useful for the analysis of coupled stress and pore pressure effects in geomechanical problems. Such results are useful for many drilling applications especially in evaluation of such cases as wellbore instability and many other drilling problems.",

The BOA is depending upon a bat echolocation behavior for global optimization, which the global optimum solution reached at the suggested minimum value of the objective function. The best interpretive source parameters for the subsurface structures occurred at the minimal the objective function value (global best solution). The BOA is applied to 2D SP anomaly data to estimate the characteristic source parameters (i.e., the depth to center, amplitude coefficient, origin location, geometric shape factor, and polarization and inclination angle of the causative buried structure). The BOA can be applied to single and multiple source structures in the restricted class of simple geometric shapes, which these bodies help in the validation of the subsurface ore and mineral targets. The stability and efficiency of the proposed BOA have been examined by several synthetic examples. In addition, three different real field examples from Germany and Indonesia have been successfully applied to ore and mineral investigation and geological structure studies. In general, the achieved results are in good agreement with the available borehole data and results mentioned in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital rock physics is based on imaging, segmentation and numerical computations of rock samples. Due to challenges regarding the handling of a large 3-dimensional (3D) sample, 2D algorithms have always been attractive. However, in 2D algorithms, the efficiency of the pore structures in the third direction of the generated 3D sample is always questionable. We used four individually captured µCT-images of a given Berea sandstone with different resolutions (12.922, 9.499, 5.775, and 3.436 µm) to evaluate the super-resolution 3D images generated by multistep Super Resolution Double-U-Net (SRDUN), a 2D algorithm. Results show that unrealistic features form in the third direction due to section-wise reconstruction of 2D images. To overcome this issue, we suggest to generate three 3D samples using SRDUN in different directions and then to use one of two strategies: compute the average sample (reconstruction by averaging) or segment one-directional samples and combine them together (binary combination). We numerically compute rock physical properties (porosity, connected porosity, P- and S-wave velocity, permeability and formation factor) to evaluate these models. Results reveal that compared to one-directional samples, harmonic averaging leads to a sample with more similar properties to the original sample. On the other hand, rock physics trends can be calculated using a binary combination strategy by generating low, medium and high porosity samples. These trends are compatible with the properties obtained from one-directional and averaged samples as long as the scale difference between the input and output images of SRDUN is small enough (less than about 3 in our case). By increasing the scale difference, more dispersed results are obtained.",

This research presents a study on the seismic hazard analysis of the Bagan city in Myanmar, based on a probabilistic framework focussing on analysing 43 temples with their associated local soil information. To this end, two seismic source models are developed based on the tectonic setting of the region and information available. Instrumental and historical records are compiled from both literature and international earthquake catalogues while conducting catalogue completeness. This study uses state-of-the-art ground motion models to perform probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and develop seismic hazard maps for different return periods in the region. Results are also expressed for selected temples in the region in terms of site-specific uniform hazard spectra. The findings indicate significant seismic activity, with peak ground acceleration in the region ranging from 0.25 to 0.36 g for a return period of 2475 years, 0.22–0.32 g for a return period of 975 years, and 0.18–0.24 g for a return period of 475 years. The updated hazard levels indicate that the literature slightly underestimates hazard in the region under study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We analyzed magnetic data of a deep-water area in the Eastern Mediterranean, offshore Egypt where there are numerous salt domes. Regional-residual separation of the reduced to pole (RTP) magnetic anomalies was performed with the discrete wavelet transform, and the residual magnetic anomalies were interpreted as mainly due to the susceptibility contrast between sediments and salt bodies. A multiscale boundary analysis of the anomalies yielded meaningful lineaments at both large and short scales. Salt bodies lineaments are very well defined in the short-scale map. Then, we inverted the data by a nonlinear and non-iterative 3D inversion technique, to delineate the salt bodies and estimate their magnetization contrast. We used the depths obtained from the Euler deconvolution to form a set of maxima and minima constraints in the inversion. Our procedure yielded an interesting map of the top of salt in the deep-water region, entirely based on the magnetic data, which agrees well with the seismic top of salt. This is a somewhat surprising result, in some respects not obvious, demonstrating that magnetic prospecting can be an important and low-cost tool for the exploration of salt diapirs, especially when seismic data are partially or completely inaccessible or of poor quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main reason that deteriorates air quality in mega cities is the increase in concentrations of air pollutant parameters. Meteorological parameters and atmospheric conditions play an important role in the increase of pollutant concentrations. This study provides insights into temperature inversions (TIs) during polluted days (PDs) and severe polluted days (SPDs) in Istanbul. Key findings include higher inversion frequencies during SPDs, particularly at 0000 UTC, along with a positive relationship between inversion frequencies and pollutant concentrations, notably with a 99% occurrence of inversions at 0000 UTC along SPDs. Analysis of inversion subgroups reveals surface-based inversions (SBIs) dominating at 0000 UTC, while elevated (EIs) and lower-troposphere inversions (LTIs) prevail at 1200 UTC. Winter months exhibit increased frequency and intensity of SBIs, aligning with expectations of subsidence motion under high-pressure systems. Inversion strengths and depths are higher during SPDs, with the highest strengths observed in winter at 0000 UTC and the deepest inversions occurring in winter for SPDs. Generally, the highest inversion strengths and shallowest inversion depths were observed in SBIs. EIs had the lowest frequency during the winter months, while LTIs occurred more often in the spring months. These findings underscore the importance of understanding TI patterns for effective air quality management in Istanbul.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Human society and the environment are facing significant challenges due to climate change. Climate change is projected to impact main climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation. Changes in main climate variables affect climate classification and alter climate zone maps. In this research, first, the projection of temperature and precipitation in 30 main stations of Iran under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6) for the end of the twenty-first century (2071–2099) was carried out. Then, the future of climate zone maps was assessed in Iran by Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The evaluation of the model data based on observation data for the period of 1991–2020 showed an acceptable correlation, with R-square and RMSE values in the ranges of 0.67–0.96 and 2.44–8.38, respectively. Results showed that the temperature in the future period (2071–2099) will increase by 1–4.7 °C under all scenarios compared to the historical study period (1991–2020), while the precipitation will either increase or decrease depending on the season and the specific climate change scenario. Assessment of future climate classifications revealed that the BW (arid desert) and BS (semi-arid steppe) categories will increase, as classified by Köppen-Geiger, will increase. At the same time, Ds and Cs (dry summer) classifications will decrease in during the study period over Iran. These findings provide policymakers with some insights into how to deal with the impacts of climate change in the future and implement some measures now.",

This paper presents results of analysis of 16-year time series derived from EUREF Permanent Network (EPN) reprocessing performed by the Military University of Technology. For 58 stations Lomb-Scargle periodograms were performed in order to obtain information about the oscillations in ZTD time series. Seasonal components and linear trend were estimated using Least Square Estimation (LSE) and Mann—Kendall trend test was used to confirm the presence of a linear trend designated by LSE method. In order to verify the impact of the length of time series on trend value, comparison between 16 and 18 years were performed.",

The model acronym DATTUTDUT (Deriving Atmosphere Turbulent Transport Useful To Dummies Using Temperature) is a Dutch word which loosely translates as \"it's unbelievable that it works\". DATTUTDUT is fully automated and only requires a surface temperature map, making it simple to use and providing a rapid estimate of spatially-distributed fluxes. The algorithm is first tested over a range of environmental and land-cover conditions using data from four short-term field experiments and then evaluated over a growing season in an agricultural region. Flux model output is in satisfactory agreement with observations and established remote sensing-based models, except under dry and partial canopy cover conditions. This suggests that DATTUTDUT has utility in identifying relative water use and as an operational tool providing initial estimates of ET anomalies in data-poor regions that would be confirmed using more robust modeling techniques.",

The field gamma-ray spectrometry indicated the concentration of uranium ranging from 5.5 to 87 ppm, thorium from 5.6 to 33.2 ppm, and potassium from 0.3 to 4.7%. The measured dose rates ranged from 115 to 582 nGy/h, the highest doses being at the copper ore. Concentrations in the solid samples were in the range of 20–1700 Bq/kg for uranium, 20–92.7 Bq/kg for thorium, and 7–1345 Bq/kg for potassium. The calculated doses were from 22 to 896 nGy/h; both measured and calculated dose rates are mostly related to uranium. Concentrations of radium in water samples were below 0.17 Bq/L. Uranium in water samples was significantly higher than the hydrogeological background; the maximum of 13 Bq/L was at the waste zone pool, but neither radium nor uranium were present in tap water. Radon concentration in the dwelling air was from 42 to 278 Bq/m3 for 222Rn and from 8 to 193 Bq/m3 for 220Rn. The estimated committed dose rates were principally related to 222Rn concentration and ranged from 1.1 to 8.1 mSv/y.",

Therefore, this study has been undertaken in order to determine the frequency, timing and spatial extent of extremely cold months in winter time at 60 weather stations across Europe over a sixty-year period from 1951 to 2010. Extremely cold months (ECMs) are defined as months in which the average air temperature is lower than the corresponding multi-annual average by at least 2 standard deviations. Half of all the ECMs occurred in the years 1951–1970 (33 out of 67). The lowest number of ECMs was recorded in the decade 1991–2000, but since the beginning of the 21st century, their density and territorial extent has started to increase again. The extremely cold months with ECMs of the greatest spatial extent, covering at least one third of the stations (over 20 stations), included: February 1954 (22), February 1956 (36), January 1963 (25), and January 1987 (23 stations).",

Four mountainous basins and the corresponding outlets have been chosen for modeling the streamflow dynamics using TOPMODEL, a physically based semi-distributed topohydrological model. The model has been calibrated using the Monte Carlo approach—with discharge, rainfall, and evapotranspiration data used to estimate the parameters. The overall performance of the model was judged by interpreting the efficiency measures. TOPMODEL was able to reproduce the main pattern of the hydrograph with acceptable accuracy for two of the investigated catchments. However, it failed to simulate the hydrological response in the remaining two catchments. The best performing data set obtained Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.78. This data set was chosen to conduct a detailed analysis aiming to estimate the optimal timespan of input data for which TOPMODEL performs best. The best fit was attained for the half-year time span. The model was validated and found to reveal good skills.",

In this paper we compare global and regional changes in TWS computed using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) land hydrology models and observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We also compare hydrological excitation functions derived from models with those obtained from the GRACE mission and the hydrological signal in observed polar motion excitation (the so-called geodetic residuals). The results confirm that GLDAS models of seasonal and non-seasonal TWS change are more consistent with GRACE data than climate models; on the other hand, none of the considered models are fully consistent with GRACE data or geodetic residuals. In turn, GRACE observations are most consistent with the non-seasonal hydrological signal in observed excitation. A detailed study of the contribution of different TWS components to the hydrological excitation function shows that soil moisture dominates.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the relationship between ground-penetrating radar (GPR) response and agriculture properties of soil with a view to understanding how the constraint of soil degradation may influence the properties. GPR field data measurements were made at a location with soil types, properties, and disturbances caused by tractor movement. The data were processed, and empirical equations relating soil physical properties and material properties of soil media were considered for the analysis of the field data. The results showed a change in the reflection coefficient and increase in the GPR wave velocity when comparing the records of the initial parts of the GPR records, lasting about 2.5 ns, of the signal response of soil subjected to compaction as a result of 10 tractor passes, with those obtained prior to movement of the tractor. The summation of the absolute value of GPR wave amplitude in the analyzed results clearly shows that the amplitude of the signal corresponding to the compressed ground is twice and even three times smaller than the amplitude recorded before the tractor runs. The results prompted the design of a relatively simple method for tracking changes in soil properties based on the results of GPR measurements, which show that zones subjected to direct tire pressure are easy to delineate and are not limited to the part that is directly under the tire, but extend about 0.5 m. It thus shows that there is a relationship between the penetration resistance induced by a change in porosity and changes in the coefficient of reflectivity and the velocity of radar waves.",

Time series of geoid height variations were calculated for the chosen subareas of the aforementioned area using those GGMs. Thereafter, these variations were analyzed using two different methods. On the basis of the analysis results, models of temporal geoid height variations were developed and discussed. The possibility of prediction of geoid height variations using GRACE mission data over the area of Poland was also investigated. The main findings reveal that the geoid height over the area of Poland vary within 1.1 cm which should be considered when defining the geoid model of 1 cm accuracy for this area.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the impact of maximum flow uncertainty on flood hazard zone is analyzed. Two factors are taken into account: (1) the method for determination of maximum flows and (2) the limited length of the data series available for calculations. The importance of this problem is a consequence of the implementation of the EU Flood Directive in all EU member states. The factors mentioned seem to be among the most important elements responsible for potential uncertainty and inaccuracy of the developed flood hazard maps. Two methods are analyzed, namely the quantiles method and the maximum likelihood method. The maximum flows are estimated for the Wronki gauge station located in the reach of the Warta river. This simple river system is located in the central part of Poland. The length of the available data is 44 years. Hence, the series of the lengths 40, 30 and 20 years are tested and compared with reference calculations for 44 years. The hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS is used to calculate water surface profiles in steady state flow. The Python scripting language is applied for automation of HEC-RAS calculations and processing of final results in the form of inundation maps. The number of trials for each factor is not huge to keep the presented methodology useful in practice. The chosen measure of uncertainty is the range of variability for maximum flow values as well as inundation areas. The estimated values stressed the great importance of the factors analyzed for the uncertainty of the maximum flows as well as inundation areas. The impact of the data series length on the maximum flows is straightforward; a shorter data series gives a wider range of variability. However, the dependencies between other factors are more complex. Hence, the application of methodology based on the simulation and GIS data processing for assessment of this problem seems to be quite a good approach.",

These statistical methods provide a better understanding of the aquifer hydrochem-istry, and put in evidence a hydrochemical classification of wells, showing that the area with higher salinity is located close to the coast, in the first two kilometers, where the salinity gradually increases as one approaches the seaside and suggests the groundwater salinization by sea-water intrusion.",

Results showed that the IRI-2012 model can reflect the climatic characteristics and solar activity dependence of ionospheric TEC. By using time series decomposition method, ionospheric daily averaged TEC values were divided into the periodic components, geomagnetic activity component, solar activity component and secular trend.

    "abstract": "Abstract Measuring the blast-induced ground vibration at blasting sites is very important, to plan and avoid adverse effects of blasting in terms of the peak particle velocity (PPV). However, the measurement of PPV often requires time, cost, and logistic commitment, which may not be economical for small-scale mining operations. This has prompted the development of numerous regression equations in the literature to estimate PPV from a relatively easier to estimate scaled distance (SD) measurement. With numerous regression equations available in the literature, there is a challenge of how to select the appropriate model for a specific blasting site, more so that rocks behave differently from site to site because of different geological processes that rocks are subjected to. This study develops a method that selects appropriate models for specific blasting sites by comparing the evidence and occurrence probability of different regression models. The appropriate model is the model with the highest evidence and occurrence probability given the available blasting site SD data. The selected model is then integrated with prior knowledge and available blasting SD data in Bayesian framework for probabilistic characterization of PPV. The SD and PPV data at the opencast coal mine, Jharia coalfield in the Dhanbad district of Jharkhand, India, is used to illustrate and validate the approach. The mean and standard deviation of simulated PPV samples from the proposed approach are 12.38 mm/s and 7.36 mm/s, respectively, which are close to the mean of 12.03 mm/s and standard deviation of 9.24 mm/s estimated from the measured PPV at the site. In addition, the probability distribution of the simulated PPV samples is consistent with the probability distribution of the measured PPV at the blasting site.",

In the research, the river water bodies with characteristic toponyms (hydronyms) in Greece that potentially reflect the water’s quality or the occurrence of floods are evaluated in comparison to the European Union’s (EU) Water Framework and Flood Directives implementation process outputs. For doing so, after identifying the river water bodies with characteristic toponyms which form the 10.2% of the Greek water bodies, the toponyms are cross correlated with the water bodies quality status as retrieved by the Directives’ databases to validate the existence of linkages between the names and the quality. Similarly, the significant floods, as derived from the Flood Directive, are spatially allied with the water bodies with characteristic toponyms to ground truth the connection between significant floods and water bodies whose toponyms imply flood prone areas. The research outputs indicate a high degree of correlation both in terms of water quality and floods, meaning that in almost all cases the water body toponym depicts the good or bad quality of the water body or the occurrence of flood events. Moreover, it is established that almost 90% of the water bodies with characteristic names are intermittent and ephemeral ones. The water bodies’ toponyms, hence, are proposed as an auxiliary criterion during the Directives implementation process that could foster increased water quality and flood-related knowledge, especially in intermittent and ephemeral water bodies which are generally lacking observations, and can be applied not only in all EU-Member States’ waters, but also in global scale.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to Sharkia population’s rapid growth, the crises of atmospheric pollutants are causing significant concern. These circumstances have positive and negative impacts on both environment and climate. This research aims to investigate and evaluate changes in land and air characteristics of the governorate using remotely sensed data from several satellites (Landsat, Aqua, Terra, and Sentinel-5P) in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Three multitemporal Landsat images were acquired in July 2002, 2012, and 2022, to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) changes during the past 20 years. In addition, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data were obtained daily over 2022, and Particulate Matter (PM 2.5 ) was calculated and then averaged seasonally. Sentinel-5P was utilized for CO, NO 2 , and SO 2 retrievals. Results showed that the governorate was continuously subjected to spatiotemporal changes in LULC during the whole study period. It was mainly occupied by vegetation with a total area of 3711.64, 3851.05, and 3794.59 km 2 in 2002, 2012, and 2022, respectively. Seasonal means of PM 2.5 followed this order: spring (77.59 µg/m 3 ) &gt; summer (50.76 µg/m 3 ) &gt; winter (49.29 µg/m 3 ) &gt; autumn (42.71 µg/m 3 ). However, the winter season recorded the highest mean values for all gases, CO (946.58 µg/m 3 ), NO 2 (9.70 µg/m 3 ), and SO 2 (13.07 µg/m 3 ). It was concluded that the southern region of the governorate is more vulnerable to environmental stresses, which can reduce biodiversity and ultimately affect the study area’s climate. In order to manage fragile ecosystems sustainably, this study recommends the creation of efficient land and air management information systems and regulations.",

Mass fish deaths also occurred during that time in the Gliwice Canal, located in southern Poland, which connects to the upper section of the Oder River. The aim of the article was to assess the impact of the waters from the Gliwice Canal on the water quality changes in the Oder River, as expressed by chloride, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate content, as well as its parameters such as conductivity, temperature, and pH. Statistical analyses were conducted based on our own research and a series of data collected by the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection. Below the confluence of the Oder River with the waters of the canal, an increase in sulphates levels and a decrease in sodium content were observed. The other parameters remained unchanged. It was also noted that the magnitude of each parameter was significantly higher in the waters of the Gliwice Canal compared to the Oder River. The research conclusion is that there is no influence of the canals’ waters on the quality of the Oder River waters, both during the ecological disaster and afterwards. The presented research clearly indicates the need for separate analyses of flowing waters (with significantly higher salt and other pollutant dissolution capacity) and stagnant waters in water infrastructure (without water exchange).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accurately predicting aerosol optical depth (AOD), a key parameter for characterizing atmospheric aerosols, is essential due to the increasing prevalence of air pollution and its detrimental effects. From existing literature on AOD time-series prediction, linear models like seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) are commonly used, while nonlinear models such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have gained popularity recently for their ability to handle nonlinear patterns. This study introduces a hybrid model, particle swarm optimization-seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average-support vector regression (PSOSARIMA-PSOSVR), which integrates linear and nonlinear modeling through residual modeling to significantly enhance AOD prediction accuracy. By combining these approaches, we aim to better handle the nonlinearities and overall variability in AOD data, leading to more accurate predictions. To address hyperparameter tuning challenges, including the risks of model misspecification and overfitting or underfitting, PSO is utilized for optimization. PSO’s evolutionary optimization ensures efficient tuning for optimal model performance. Monthly AOD data sourced from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite covering the northern Indian region from 2001 to 2019 is used for experiments. Performance metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination ( $$R^2$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msup> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:msup> </mml:math> ), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error ratio (RSR) are employed to evaluate model accuracy and dependability. The results of this study illustrate that the proposed PSOSARIMA-PSOSVR model outperforms both standalone PSOSARIMA and PSOSVR models. Moreover, it consistently surpasses SARIMA, SVR, and long short-term memory (LSTM) in AOD prediction, effectively addressing non-stationarity and variability challenges in AOD data. This study suggests the hybrid model as a promising approach for improving the accuracy of AOD prediction.",

Specifically, the study addressed the frequency, long-term change and spatial coverage of exceptionally hot summers, and exceptionally cool summers (EHS and ECS) in Europe. The statistical criterion of plus/minus two standard deviations from the long-term average was used to identify EHS and ECS at 60 weather stations over the period 1951–2010. The study has demonstrated that EHS are characterised by greater temperature anomalies than ECS and are approximately twice as frequent. They occurred virtually everywhere within the study area, whilst ECS are concentrated in its northern part. Five EHS (1972, 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2010) and three ECS (1956, 1962, and 1976) were large enough to be recorded by at least 10% of the stations.",

In situ shear wave velocity (Vs) is measured by some sonic logging tools. Shear velocity coupled with compressional velocity is vitally important in determining geomechanical parameters, identifying the lithology, mud weight design, hydraulic fracturing, geophysical studies such as VSP, etc. In this paper, a correlation between compressional and shear wave velocity is obtained for Gachsaran formation in Maroon oil field. Real data were used to examine the accuracy of the prediction equation. Moreover, the genetic algorithm was used to obtain the optimal value for constants of the suggested equation. Furthermore, artificial neural network was used to inspect the reliability of this method. These investigations verify the notion that the suggested equation could be considered as an efficient, fast, and cost-effective method for predicting Vs from Vp.",

In this study, the HFU approach is introduced to classify rocks, and determine the involved parameters in the SDR model. Based on the difference of FZI, 87 core samples, drilled from tight gas sandstones reservoirs of E basin in northwest China and applied for laboratory NMR measurements, were classified into three types, and the involved parameters in the SDR model are calibrated separately. Meanwhile, relationships of porosity versus permeability are also established. The statistical model is used to calculate consecutive FZI from conventional logs. Field examples illustrate that the calibrated SDR models are applicable in permeability estimation; models established from routine core analyzed results are effective in reservoirs with permeability lower than 0.3 mD, while the unified SDR model is only valid in reservoirs with permeability ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 mD.",

The analyses were performed for the mountain catchment of the Kamienica river, right-hand tributary of the Dunajec. The amount of direct runoff was calculated using the following methods: (1) Original NRCS-CN model, (2) Mishra—Singh model (MS model), (3) Sahu Mishra Eldho model (SME model), (4) Sahu 1-p model, (5) Sahu 3-p model, and (6) Q_base model. The study results indicated that the amount of direct runoff, determined on the basis of the original NRCS-CN method, may differ significantly from the actually observed values. The best results were achieved when the direct runoff was determined using the SME and Sahu 3-p model.",

The analysis covers low- and mid-latitude stations. The effects of ionospheric storm during SSC period is insignificant compared to the main phase, but can trigger the latter. The main phase is characterized by severe negative storm effect at both latitudes during VIS periods while it is latitudinal symmetric for IS observations. The IS reveal positive/negative storm phase in the low-/mid-latitudes, respectively. Ionization density effect is more prominent during VIS events, and is attributed to large energetic particle and solar activity input into the earth magnetosphere. However, ionospheric effect is more significant at the low-latitude than at the mid-latitude. Lastly, ionospheric storm effect during a geomagnetic storm may be related to the combinational effect of interplanetary and geomagnetic parameters and internal ionospheric effect, not necessarily the solar wind alone.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an application of rock physics templates constructed with the use of the granular effective medium theory and the shale model to estimate the elastic properties of the Silurian and Ordovician shale formations from the Baltic Basic, Poland. The author uses available logging data from three nearby wells and their petrophysical interpretation to distinguish various lithologies and to determine average matrix mineral composition of each lithology group, essential in further rock physics modelling. Anisotropy estimation and investigation of the relation between various petrophysical parameters precede the rock physics modelling. The logging data cross-plotted in Vp/Vs ratio–acoustic impedance domain reveals distinct compaction trend for shales, which is not followed by shales with increased organic matter and calcareous deposits. These two lithology groups present own trends, which are related to increasing kerogen and carbonate minerals contents, respectively. The trends are the subject of rock physics modelling. Granular effective medium rock physics templates are constructed for each lithology group. The rock physics analyses reveal that the elastic properties of strongly compacted shales, including shales with organic matter, might be successfully described by the lower modified Hashin–Shtrikman bound, which is useful in compaction trend modelling. Marly deposits can be modelled in a similar way to shales. The upper modified Hashin–Shtrikman bound provides a better template for carbonates as it models the cementation process. The shale model provides independent rock physics template for shales. Comparison of these two approaches shows that the granular effective medium method better describes the elastic properties of the analysed formations. The paper includes also the proposition of the final rock physics template constructed for the Silurian and the Ordovician formation from the Baltic Basin that can contribute to a better understanding of the elastic properties of the lower Paleozoic shale plays in Poland.",

The subsurface is discre-tized using a hybrid mesh generated by the combination of structured and unstructured meshes, which reduces the computational cost of the whole inversion procedure. The inversion routine is based on the smoothness constrained least squares method. In order to verify the program, responses of two test models and field data sets were inverted. The models inverted from the synthetic data sets are consistent with the original test models in both DC resistivity and IP cases. A field data set acquired in an archaeological site is also used for the verification of outcomes of the program in comparison with the excavation results.",

It was confirmed that forecasting the pattern of flowing water temperature from changes in air temperature yields better results when done based on data from the previous day. Results of modelling the relationship between data series with the use of the linear and natural cubic splines models confirmed the presence of a nonlinear relation. It was also established that there is a statistically significant correlation of random fluctuations for both temperature series on the same days. This made it possible to confirm the occurrence of short-term connections between water and air temperature.

Three additive fracture ranges were distinguished, characterized by successively increasing aperture and fracture length values, operatively named micro, meso and macro. Furthermore, the quantitative characterization of fractures with different apertures was done. The methodology of laboratory data integration, fracture porosity and fracture permeability measurements performed on thin section and polished section was described as part of the quantitative well logging data interpretation procedure which uses the FPI ( fracture porosity index ) parameter. The research was performed in the Lower Carboniferous limestone formation that builds the Paleozoic basement of the Carpathian orogeny. An original software dedicated to the analysis of the wellbore images, obtained with the XRMI Halliburton scanner, was used to identify the presence of macro-fractures, determine their aperture and estimate fractures porosity and permeability in the profile of the analyzed rock formation. As a result of the work, postulates regarding the methodology for collecting research material were formulated, in particular: the scope of different laboratory core samples measurements and well log types. The principles of the optimal methodology for identifying fractured zones and quantitative evaluation of petrophysical parameters of recognized fracture systems were defined.",

The results show that the sediment transport rate essentially remains unchanged when the ratio of the injection velocity and that at boiling, Vi/Vcr < 10. However, significant sediment transport rate is observed when Vi/Vcr increases beyond this limit. In the literature, three semi-empirical models have been developed to relate seepage effects on the sediment transport rate. The experimentally measured data in the pre- and post-boiling condition (Liu and Chiew 2014, and the present study, respectively) are compared with these models. The results show that the models of Francalanci et al. (2008) and Nielsen et al. (2001) perform poorly in predicting injection effects on the sediment transport. Although Yang's (2013) model could reasonably predict the influence of injection on the sediment transport rate in the post-boiling condition, it similarly fails when applied to the pre-boiling condition.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of the Linke turbidity factor (LTF) were performed at Belsk (20.78°E, 51.83°N), Poland, since 1964. This data is used to retrieve broadband aerosol optical thickness normalized to the air mass equal to 2 (BAOT2). A linear analysis of the BAOT2 changes reveals an upward trend of 0.023±0.017(2σ) in the 1964–1975 period, a downward trend of–0.051±0.017(2σ) in the 1976–1991 period, and afterwards a statistically insignificant trend of–0.009 ± 0.014(2σ). Such pattern may be related to the economic changes in Poland (changing emissions and environmental policies). The elevated BAOT2 values, excluded from the trend, are found in 1984 and 1992 due to the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo, respectively. Past AOT values at 340 and 500 nm are reconstructed using a linear relationship found between AOT and BAOT2. The reconstructed data is used by the radiative transfer models to estimate a response of the total solar and erythemal radiation to the changes in the atmospheric aerosols at Belsk.",

    "abstract": "To emphasize the relationship between the pre-seismic geomagnetic signals and Vrancea seismicity, in this work it is hypothesized that before an earthquake initiation, the high stress reached into seismogenic volume generates dehydration of the rocks and fracturing processes followed by release of electric charges along the faulting systems, which lead to resistivity changes. These changes were explored on September 2016 by the normalized function Bzn obtained from the geomagnetic data recorded in ULF range (0.001–0.0083 Hz). A statistical analysis was also performed to discriminate on the new Bzn* time series a pre-seismic signature related to the Mw5.7 earthquake. Significant anomalous behavior of Bzn* was identified on September 21, with 3 days prior to the onset of the seismic event. Similar information is provided by registrations of the magnetic and electron concentration variations in the ionosphere over the Vrancea zone, by Swarm satellites, 4 days and 1 day before the earthquake.",

The results of CT images interpretation, made for 17 samples of Paleozoic carbonate rocks were shown. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of a pore system was performed. Objects were clustered according to the pore size. Within the clusters, the geometry parameters were analysed. The following dependences were obtained for carbonate rocks, also for individual clusters (due to the volume): (1) a linear relationship (on a bilogarithmic scale) between the specific surface and the Feret diameter and (2) a strong linear relationship between specific surface area and Feret diameter and average diameter of the objects calculated for the sphere. The results were then combined with available results from standard laboratory tests, including NMR and MICP.",

These coefficients are applied to express the fluid kinetic energy and momentum equations as functions of a mean velocity. The study is based on laboratory measurements of water velocity distributions in a straight rectangular flume with stiff and flexible stems and plastic imitations of the Canadian waterweed. The coefficients were established for the vegetation layer, surface layer and the whole flow area. The results indicate that the energy and momentum coefficients increase significantly with water depth and the number of stems per unit channel area. New regression relationships for both coefficients are given.",

NMR signal analysis and interpretation were performed. Based on NMR driven models, permeability and Free Fluid Index were calculated for data sets divided into homogeneous clusters. Computerized mercury porosimetry results visualization and processing provided useful information, as the automatically determined Swanson parameter is correlated with petrophysical properties of rocks. Micro-CT enriched the image of porous space in qualitative and quantitative ways. Homogeneity of pore space structure was discussed using micro-CT approach. Integration of the results in the frame of reservoir parameters from standard laboratory methods and the modern ones resulted in the improvement of methodology for determining the old, deep-seated, hard sedimentary rocks reservoir potential.",

The project encompassed theoretical, field, and modeling work. It was focused around observation-based hydroclimatology; projections for the future; dendrogeomorphology; as well as influence of transport of large wood on fluvial processes. The project improved understanding and interpreting changes in high-flow frequency and magnitude as well as changes in flood risk in the region, related to the presence of large wood in mountain streams. A unique database on past episodes of intense precipitation and flooding was created, harnessing multiple sources. The project showed that the analysis of tree rings and wood logs can offer useful information, complementing and considerably enriching the knowledge of river floods in the region of northern foothills of the Tatra Mountains. Retrospective and scenario-defined modeling of selected past fluvial events in the region was also performed.",

The events occurred between 2008 and 2013 at mining level 850–1350 m in the Kiirunavaara Mine (Sweden). Hypocenter locations were refined using from 6 to 130 sensors at distances of up to 1400 m. The source parameters of the events were re-estimated using spectral analysis with a standard Brune model (slope −2). The radiated energy for the studied events varied from 4.7 × 10−1 to 3.8 × 107 J, the source radii from 4 to 110 m, the apparent stress from 6.2 × 102 to 1.1 × 106 Pa, energy ratio (E s/E p) from 1.2 to 126, and apparent volume from 1.8 × 103 to 1.1 × 107 m3. 90% of the events were located in the footwall, close to the ore contact. The events were classified as shear/fault slip (FS) or non-shear (NS) based on the E s/E p ratio (>10 or <10). Out of 46 events 15 events were classified as NS located almost in the whole range between 840 and 1360 m, including many events below the production. The rest 31 FS events were concentrated mostly around the production levels and slightly below them. The relationships between some source parameters and seismic moment/moment magnitude showed dependence on the type of the source mechanism. The energy and the apparent stress were found to be three times larger for FS events than for NS events.",

The gasification of coal in a bed entails various technological problems and poses risks to the environment. Therefore, in parallel with research on coal gasification technologies, it is necessary to develop techniques for remote sensing of the process environment. One such technique may be the radar method, which allows imaging of regions of mass loss (voids, fissures) in coal during and after carrying out a gasification process in the bed. The paper describes two research experiments. The first one was carried out on a large-scale model constructed on the surface. It simulated a coal seam in natural geological conditions. A second experiment was performed in a shallow coal deposit maintained in a disused mine and kept accessible for research purposes. Tests performed in the laboratory and in situ conditions showed that the method provides valuable data for assessing and monitoring gasification surfaces in the UCG processes. The advantage of the GPR method is its high resolution and the possibility of determining the spatial shape of various zones and forms created in the coal by the gasification process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Isotopic composition of precipitation ( 2 H /1 H and 18 O/ 16 O isotope ratios, tritium content) is nowadays widely used in numerous applications of environmental isotopes—most notably in hydrology, climatology and biogeochemistry. Here we present a long record (44 years) of stable isotope composition and tritium content in monthly precipitation available for the Krakow station (southern Poland). Krakow is the only site in Poland for which long-term record of the isotopic composition of monthly precipitation is available. The tritium data are discussed here in the context of generally declining levels of bomb tritium in the global atmosphere and growing influence of technogenic emissions of this isotope. Two aspects of temporal variability of stable isotope composition of precipitation collected in Krakow are discussed here: (i) seasonality and (ii) interannual changes of δ 18 O and δ 2 H signal. Whereas the seasonality of stable isotope signal is generated mainly by seasonally varying the degree of rainout of air masses bringing moisture from the source regions (subtropical Atlantic Ocean) to the centre of the European continent, the North Atlantic Oscillation seems to govern interannual changes of δ 18 O and δ 2 H on the decadal timescale. Progressing warming of the local atmosphere, in the order of 1.8 °C in the past four decades, leaves its imprint in stable isotope signal measured in Krakow precipitation; the slope of isotope–temperature relationship is in the order of 0.50‰/°C for δ 18 O and 3.5‰/°C for δ 2 H.",

The presented Multi-Event Simulation of Extreme Flood method (MESEF) combines design event method based on single-rainfall event modelling, and continuous simulation method used for estimating the maximum discharges of a given exceedance probability using rainfall-runoff models.

The significant results revealed that the power spectral density of low-frequency electric field below 20 Hz in the ionosphere, a kind of electromagnetic radiation phenomena, increased abnormally before and after the earthquakes and partially corresponded to the increased power spectral density of the low-frequency geoelectric field in time. This research preliminarily indicates that the low-frequency electromagnetic radiation during the imminent stages before such earthquakes could be detected by the observation of the ionospheric electric field. However, the spatial, temporal, and intensive complexities of the electric field anomalies in the ionosphere before earthquakes have come in sight also.",

Thresholds for the classifiers are automatically calculated adaptively to data statistics. The proposed method is employed for the exemplary problem of artificial area identification. Classification of IKONOS multispectral data results in short computational time and overall accuracy of 94.4% comparing to 94.0% obtained by using AdaBoost.M1 with trees and 93.8% achieved using Random Forest.

LAGEOS orbits and SLR observation residuals from solutions based on different ocean tide models are compared and examined. It is found that LAGEOS orbits are sensitive to tidal waves larger than 5 mm. The analysis of the aliasing periods of LAGEOS orbits and tidal waves reveals that, in particular, the tidal constituent S2 is not well established in the recent ocean tide models. Some of the models introduce spurious peaks to empirical orbit parameters, which can be associated with S2, Sa, and K2 tidal constituents, and, as a consequence, can be propagated to fundamental parameters derived from LAGEOS observations.",

Moreover, the GEC/GECQT will decrease with the increase of the solar flux F10.7 index. Furthermore, we construct a linear model for storm-time response of GEC. Eighty-two storm events during 1999–2011 were utilized to calculate the model coefficients, and the performance of the model was tested using data of 8 storm events in 2012 by comparing the outputs of the model with the observed GEC values. Results suggest that the model can capture the characteristics of the GEC variation in response to magnetic storms. The component describing the solar activity influence shows a counteracting effect with the geomagnetic activity component; and the influence of Kp index causes an increase of GEC, while the time weighted Dst index causes a decrease of GEC.",

Field observations indicate that the composition of the bed materials obviously influences the shape of vertical velocity distribution. To clearly understand the roughness effect, six types of materials were laid separately at various depths for the investigation of the effects of roughness elements on the vertical velocity distribution. A down-looking 3D acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure the velocity profiles. The experimental results showed that the curve characteristics of velocity profiles are strongly dependent on the roughness scale and related flow parameters. If d/R, Fr, and Re are larger than 0.15, 0.47, and 60 000, respectively, the velocity distribution may resemble an S-shape profile. The inflexion position Z*/H for a given S-shape profile was empirically deduced as Z*/H = −0.4481d/R + 0.3225. Otherwise, the velocity profile agrees well with the logarithmic law. The findings of this study are useful in engineering practice (i.e., depth-averaged velocity and flow rate estimate).

The Z-R relationships for rain and rainwith- snow showed a strong resemblance to the well-known Marshall- Palmer Z-R power-type relationship for rain.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study used a geospatial model to evaluate the regional distributions and buildup of various Heavy Metals (HM) and micronutrients as a result of groundwater irrigation used for lengthy periods in Egypt’s El-Kharga and El-Farafra oases, which were formed on western desert terrain, were the subject of the study. To fulfill this aim, field sampling of soil and groundwater was integrated with cartographic modeling. The evaluated HM concentrations in the water samples are below the permitted level for irrigation. The surface soil’s element concentrations were within acceptable limits. However, protracted mobility and a potency risk for soil smearing were not spotted. The apportionment of HM concentricity versus soil profundity showed that the assemblage was primarily in the topsoil. Future management plans should consider ongoing HM level monitoring. The lands are divided into three classes: II, III, and IV, according to their capabilities, while the soils are divided into three classes based on their suitability: moderately suitable class S2, marginally acceptable class S3, and permanently unsuitable class N2. Additionally, soil fertility and quality were categorized into low and moderate categories. Land evaluations indicate that they are promising areas for agricultural investment under the conditions of using modern agricultural techniques. The most important results of the study are that the non-technical use of irrigation water in some areas has exacerbated the problems of salinity, especially in those where the drainage characteristics are poor. Concentrations of HM were found only in agricultural areas adjacent to urban areas and poor drainage, especially in agricultural areas reclaimed for more than 50 years. High concentrations of HM were also found in shallow wells close to the same places, and there were no significant concentrations in blind wells. The main recommendation of the study is the necessity of using modern agricultural and irrigation systems in those places.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The interaction between vegetation, sediment, and water flow creates various fluvial landscapes. Hydrological conditions and flood disturbances, as well as the habitat preference of vegetation, regulate its spatial distribution. To describe the spatial distribution of vegetation cover, here, we focus on vegetation distributions along river transverse transects that define vertical and horizontal distances from water areas during low flow periods. As one of the most dynamic river types, braided rivers can be significantly influenced by vegetation encroachment. However, the effects of vegetation distributions along river transects on braided river morphology remain unknown. To study the potential influence of vegetation distribution along river transects, a depth-averaged, hydro-morphodynamic model was employed. Using the model, we investigated a medium-sized, braided river with a gravel bed affected by riparian vegetation. The following scenarios of vegetation transect distributions were examined: (1) vegetation established near or covering the low water channel, and (2) vegetation established on bar tops and kept at a distance from the low water channel. The model successfully reproduced a reduction in the braiding index for a vegetated braided river. Depending on the transect distribution scenarios employed, significantly different effects for river morphology were obtained. For example, compared to vegetation on bar tops, vegetation located near the low water channel played a more critical role for changing river morphology, redirecting water flow, and changing the statistical characteristics of the riverbed elevation distribution. Vegetation near the low water channel not only concentrated water flow to low water channels but also redirected flow to the high elevation area by reducing low water channel flow capacity. The revealed effects of the vegetation transect distribution on river morphology development helped to determine effective management protocols for reducing the negative impact of vegetation encroachment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The underwater gamma-ray spectrometer GeoMAREA was utilized for in situ continuous monitoring of radon progenies in the atmosphere near the city of Anavyssos, Attica, Greece, during the period from 1 November 2017 until 1 April 2018. The acquired spectra before and during rainfalls were used to derive rainwater’s spectra revealing that the major contributors to the observed photo-peaks are the progenies of 222 Rn ( 214 Pb, 214 Bi). The total counting rate of the spectra and the counting rate of the net areas of 352 keV and 609 keV photo-peaks ( 214 Pb and 214 Bi, respectively) proved to be effective parameters for rainfall identification and investigation. Statistical analysis did not reveal a significant association between radon progenies and temperature, pressure, humidity and dew point during rainfalls or dry meteorological conditions. However, preferable wind directions for rainwater rich in radon progenies revealed the impact of the atmospheric masses trajectories before a precipitation event. According to HYSPLIT modelling of selected rainfall events, air masses that pass over terrestrial areas at low altitudes (&lt; 1500 m above ground level) 48 h before the event result in rainwater enriched in radon progenies. On contrary, air masses that pass before an event over terrestrial areas at higher altitudes (&gt; 3000 m above ground level) result in rainwater of low radon progenies concentration. Overall, the method was considered promising for continuous in situ measurements of radon progenies in the atmosphere and may extend the use of radon as a tracer for studies related to climate investigation.",

In this study, we investigate the performance of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) over pilot regions in Africa by utilizing available surface observations, satellite and reanalysis data. The verification period covers two consecutive years (June 2018–May 2020). In addition, we assess the ability of the model to provide skillful forecasts through three high-impact precipitation events that occurred during this period. The results show that the model presents both positive and negative biases with respect to its predicted near surface air temperature, underestimates the near surface relative humidity and the mean sea-level pressure, while overestimates the wind speed at 10 m. The neighborhood-based statistical verification of the 24-h accumulated precipitation reveals that the model forecasts the precipitation events more accurately as the verification area is increasing but at higher precipitation thresholds its performance deteriorates. Different variability, errors and correlation between simulated and observed precipitation exist in each forecast lead day and region. A range of model behavior and forecast skill is found with respect to the examined three precipitation events. Skillful forecasts up to four days ahead were provided in the cases of the Tropical Cyclone IDAI and the flash flooding events in northern Tunisia, while the lowest performance was found in the region of the West African Monsoon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In many geological conditions, obtaining the static elastic moduli of crustal rocks is an essential subject for accurate mechanical analyses of crust. The elastic wave method may be the best choice if rock specimens cannot be taken since elastic wave propagation can be applied to in-situ environments. Although many signs of progress have been made in the elastic wave method, some issues still restrict the accurate extraction of static moduli and its applications. A review of this method and its further research prospect is urgently needed. With this purpose, this paper summarized and analyzed the published experimental data about the relationship between the static and dynamic Young’s moduli of rock, and the frequency dependence of wave velocities and dynamic elastic moduli. P- and S-wave velocities, Young’s, and bulk moduli of rock, especially the saturated rock, have strong frequency dependence in a wide frequency range of 10 –6 –10 6 Hz. Different rocks or conditions (such as water content, amplitude, and pressure), have different frequency-dependent characteristics. The current elastic wave method can be classified into two methods: the empirical correlation method and the multifrequency ultrasonic method. The basic principle, advantages, and disadvantages of both methods are analyzed. Especially, the reasonability of the multifrequency ultrasonic method was elaborated given the nonlinear elasticity, strain level/rate, and pores/cracks in rock materials. Existing problems and prospects on the two methods are also pointed out, such as the choice of a proper empirical correlation, accurate determination of the critical P- and S-wave velocities, the prediction of Young’s modulus at each strain level, and the reasonability of the method under various water contents and fracture structures.",

The results of eight tests for different roughness conditions (smooth bed, rough bed) and with a tree system on the floodplains from two earlier studies are presented. The increase of the channel roughness resulted in a decrease of longitudinal sizes of macroeddies in the whole channel. Trees on the floodplains resulted in disintegration of the sizes of macroeddies, making values of sizes more uniform. A more significant decreasing influence on sizes of macroeddies in the whole channel was exerted by an increase of the main channel sloping bank roughness, having a higher effect than a twofold decrease in the floodplain trees density. The microeddies’ sizes are larger in the main channel centreline than on the floodplains and the smallest ones were present in the main channel/floodplain interface.",

What level of accuracy is necessary and which processes that influence the water temperature change have to be taken into account are usually problematic. Those problems, with special stress on water–air heat exchange in practical applications in the so-called mid-field region in rivers, which is very important for the environmental impact assessment, constitute the main subject of the present article. The article also summarises the existing knowledge and practice on water–air heat exchange calculations in practical applications.",

Turbulence statistics were analyzed after thorough data filtering. In the wake of the M. alterniflorum, which was a slender, 0.3 m wide and 1.2 m long patch of aspect ratio 1:4, there were distinctive peaks in both, turbulence intensity and turbulent kinetic energy, which indicated increased lateral mixing. In contrast to the M. alterniflorum, turbulence statistics in the wake of the M. spicatum, which was the larger, 2 m wide and 2.4 m long patch of aspect ratio 1:1.5, indicated increased lateral shear of a greater magnitude. The turbulent kinetic energy was diminished in the closest layer to the bed downstream the both plants, although, in the case of M. alterniflorum, the observed values were similar to those upstream. The occurrence of the mixing layer below the height of M. spicatum was visible in the power spectral density plot. In both cases, ejections in the wake diminished in favor of other coherent structures. The shape and configuration of a patch are decisive factors governing the occurrence of flow instabilities downstream of the patch.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the level of the largest earthquake hazard is assessed in 28 seismic zones of the NW Himalaya and its vicinity, which is a highly seismically active region of the world. Gumbel's third asymptotic distribution (hereafter as GIII) is adopted for the evaluation of the largest earthquake magnitudes in these seismic zones. Instead of taking in account any type of Mmax, in the present study we consider the ω value which is the largest earthquake magnitude that a region can experience according to the GIII statistics. A function of the form Θ(ω, RP6.0) is providing in this way a relatively largest earthquake hazard scale defined by the letter K (K index). The return periods for the ω values (earthquake magnitudes) 6 or larger (RP6.0) are also calculated. According to this index, the investigated seismic zones are classified into five groups and it is shown that seismic zones 3 (Quetta of Pakistan), 11 (Hindukush), 15 (northern Pamirs), and 23 (Kangra, Himachal Pradesh of India) correspond to a \"very high\" K index which is 6.",

In the research, digital terrain models from different datasets were evaluated and used in two-dimensional hydraulic models. The following aerial and satellite elevation data were used to create the representation of terrain–digital terrain model: airborne laser scanning, image matching, elevation data collected in the LPIS, EuroDEM, and ASTER GDEM. From the results of five 2D hydrodynamic models with different input elevation data, the maximum depth and flow velocity of water were derived and compared with the results of the most accurate ALS data. For such an analysis a statistical evaluation and differences between hydraulic modelling results were prepared. The presented research proved the importance of the quality of elevation data in hydraulic modelling and showed that only ALS and photogrammetric data can be the most reliable elevation data source in accurate 2D hydraulic modelling.",

    "abstract": "The present study is considered as an exploratory study of electrical properties of meteorites at variable current frequencies, called the electrical signature. The electric resistivity has been measured at different frequencies, varying between 1 and 100 KHz for some iron meteorites (Mundrabilla and Gibeon meteorites), stony meteorite samples (NWA 869, NWA 7629 and Ghubara) and Fe-Ni alloys, of known Ni concentration, which have been prepared and used as standards to be compared with the studied meteorites. In addition, SEM studies supported by EDX technique have been applied. The SEM and EDX displays enabled us to obtain the chemical composition and internal structural fabrics of the studied samples. Porosity and density (bulk and grain densities) have also been measured for both types of meteorites. Porosity values of the studied meteorites are very low (∅ ≤ 3%) and correspond to micro vugs and cracks. The grain density of non-weathered samples varies from 3.48 g/cm3 for the stony meteorites to 7.91 g/cm3 for the iron meteorites. The obtained electrical signatures are diagnostic for each type and can be used to detect quantitatively the concentration of Ni. The electrical signature of stony meteorites is much simpler than that of iron meteorites, and simpler signatures have been obtained at higher Ni concentrations.",

For the skarn and sandstone samples, the EMR signal amplitude was observed to decrease with increasing ultimate strength. Supposedly, this effect can be explained by assuming that EMR is generated when an acoustic wave propagates through an electrical double layer. The presence of piezoelectric inclusions (e.g., quartz) in the magnetite ore enhances the analog EMR signal and its spectral components.",

Data measured above a bedform is used to analyze the importance of coherent structures in turbulent transfer. The Reynolds stress and turbulence intensity in stream-wise direction illustrate significant difference along the bedform, showing a three-layer distribution at the crest and a convex one at the downstream of bedform. Quadrant analysis technique is used to picture momentum exchange above the considered bedform and to find the dominant event in bursting process of the gravel bedform. Quadrant analysis demonstrates that the mechanisms of bedforms generation in sand and gravel-bed rivers are similar and sweep is the dominant event in both rivers.",

For the prediction of PHV, a model proposed by Si and Midorikawa was used. The regression method takes into account the impact of the local geology under seismic stations on the ground motion according to the Eurocode 8 classification. The ground classification was based on the results of a seismic survey conducted near the seismometer stations. This method is of great practical use because it allows the degree of vibration intensity to be determined on the basis of the Mining Seismic Instrumental Intensity Scale MSIIS-15 (acronym GSIGZW in Polish version) at any distance from the epicentre of the seismic events induced or triggered by mining.",

Experiments were carried out to test the physical properties of clay heated at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 800°C in a furnace. The experiment results show that below 400°C the uniaxial compressive strength and resistivity change very little. However, above 400°C, both increase rapidly. At a temperature under 400°C, the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity decrease significantly. The thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) test indicate that a series of changes occur in kaolinite at temperatures from 400 to 600°C, which is considered the primary cause of the variation of physical and mechanical properties of clay under high temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bedload transport is an important factor to describe the hydromorphological processes of fluvial systems. However, conventional bedload sampling methods have large uncertainty, making it harder to understand this notoriously complex phenomenon. In this study, a novel, image-based approach, the Video-based Bedload Tracker (VBT), is implemented to quantify gravel bedload transport by combining two different techniques: Statistical Background Model and Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry. For testing purposes, we use underwater videos, captured in a laboratory flume, with future field adaptation as an overall goal. VBT offers a full statistics of the individual velocity and grainsize data for the moving particles. The paper introduces the testing of the method which requires minimal preprocessing (a simple and quick 2D Gaussian filter) to retrieve and calculate bedload transport rate. A detailed sensitivity analysis is also carried out to introduce the parameters of the method, during which it was found that by simply relying on literature and the visual evaluation of the resulting segmented videos, it is simple to set them to the correct values. Practical aspects of the applicability of VBT in the field are also discussed and a statistical filter, accounting for the suspended sediment and air bubbles, is provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The manuscript presents the results of an aggradation experiment performed in a laboratory channel with supercritical flow. The channel was fed with a stationary sediment load exceeding the transport capacity of the flow in the initial condition, thus inducing sediment aggradation and an increase of the bed slope. The experiment is part of a laboratory campaign mimicking sediment overloading in mountain rivers, a process that can determine increased hydraulic risk levels at key spots. A crucial issue in measuring sediment aggradation is the definition and determination of the bed elevation, this issue being quite relevant in experiments with a relatively large transport capacity, where a thick bed-load layer exists and hinders the possibility to determine with confidence a reference bed elevation. The determination of the bed elevation, in turn, impacts the quantification of a number of properties, including the initial sediment transport capacity of the flow, temporal scales of the aggradation process, water depth and Froude number. The manuscript presents a sensitivity analysis of the results to two extreme definitions for the bed elevation: the first one locates the bed at the upper edge of the bed-load layer, while the second one at the lower edge of the bed-load layer where the particles do not move. The presentation of the two alternatives is focused on the experimental methods they use, consistently with the intent of the special issue. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the definition of the bed elevation also has a major impact on numerical models of the process. The experimental results have been reproduced numerically, demonstrating that the calibration parameters returning a best fit are also impacted significantly by how the bed is defined. The preferred definition for analyzing an experimental campaign is locating the bed below the bed-load layer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract River confluences have a complex flow and sedimentation pattern that have vital influences on the hydraulic and bed morphology of river reach and the surrounding area. Confluences can be observed in waterways with various situations such as live bed conditions. This condition is a hydro-morphological situation with a high densimetric Froude number, i.e., bed load transport is supplied from upstream. According to the literature review, most of the experimental studies investigate the flow pattern on the flatbed and not on the developed riverbed, or/and in the low densimetric Froude number, or/and without supplying the sediment from upstream. Therefore, in the present study for the quantification of the flow pattern under these conditions, each developed bed was fixed with the cement blanket method in the laboratory. Then, the 3D velocity was measured at specific points at the confluence. The current study was designed to understand the flow pattern corresponding to the river bed behavior in the case of large floods. It is expected that the morphological features downstream of the confluence have a different pattern than the ones in the condition described in other literature. Thus, this paper describes briefly what are the different bed features and investigates the corresponding flow pattern. The results of the flow pattern on the developed bed show that all zones at the river confluence can be observed except the point bar due to the approximate equality of the mean longitudinal velocity of the separation zone and the main channel upstream of the confluence. Moreover, results show that by increasing the bedload ratio (sediment discharge to water discharge of the main channel of upstream of the confluence) from 0 to 3 × 10 −4 , flow deflection to the outer bank of the channel decreased down to 45%, the stagnation equivalent area decreased down to 2.5 times, and bed shear stress decreased down to 40%. Hence, the momentum of lateral flow decreased with increasing bedload. Besides, the recovery zone occurred at a longer distance after the confluence compared to the case without bedload. Hence, the location of the maximum velocity zone, vortices, and secondary flows changed downstream of the confluence, by changing the bed load value.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The performance of conceptual catchment runoff models may highly depend on the specific choice of calibration methods made by the user. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) are two well-known families of Evolutionary Algorithms that are widely used for calibration of hydrological and environmental models. In the present paper, five DE and five PSO optimization algorithms are compared regarding calibration of two conceptual models, namely the Swedish HBV model (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenavdelning model) and the French GR4J model (modèle du Génie Rural à 4 paramètres Journalier) of the Kamienna catchment runoff. This catchment is located in the middle part of Poland. The main goal of the study was to find out whether DE or PSO algorithms would be better suited for calibration of conceptual rainfall-runoff models. In general, four out of five DE algorithms perform better than four out of five PSO methods, at least for the calibration data. However, one DE algorithm constantly performs very poorly, while one PSO algorithm is among the best optimizers. Large differences are observed between results obtained for calibration and validation data sets. Differences between optimization algorithms are lower for the GR4J than for the HBV model, probably because GR4J has fewer parameters to optimize than HBV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Estimating wave damping in carbonate rocks is complex due to their heterogeneous structure. For this reason, further research in this area is still necessary. Since the identification and evaluation of reservoir quality play an essential role in the optimal use of hydrocarbon resources, efforts are made to provide new solutions to achieve this goal by managing knowledge and accessing information from new tools such as the Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP). Seismic waves are deformed in frequency content and amplitude as they pass through the earth's layers. Part of the reduction in wavelength is related to the nature of the wave propagation and part to the geological properties, including porosity and fracture. Anisotropy and velocity model analysis, rather than the direct connection between reservoir parameters and seismic absorption coefficient, have received the majority of attention in earlier studies on the impact of reservoir parameters and fractures on changes in the quality factor. In this study, the correlation of the quality factor with parameters such as velocity deviation, fracture density, and permeability has been investigated, and an attempt has been made to define the quality factor as a tool to assess the quality of the reservoir. The statistical study using the multiple linear regression method found that fracture density is the most important parameter that follows the trend of the quality factor value. In the analysis, the quality factor showed a relatively good correlation with the permeability of the core data, so in the periods with maximum permeability, the quality factor had the lowest values. According to K-Means Clustering Analysis, 18% of the studied reservoir interval was evaluated as good quality, 33% as medium, 36% as poor, and 12% as hydrocarbon-free. This work provides insight into accessing reservoir quality using quality factor and velocity deviation logs and would be valuable for the development of reservoir quality prediction methods. Based on the study's results, it is recommended to apply this technique for modeling reservoir heterogeneity and assessing 2D and 3D seismic data to predict the reservoir quality of gas fields prior to drilling operations and reduce exploration risks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Single-channel sparker seismic reflection systems are currently preferred in offshore geo-engineering studies due to their cost-effectiveness, ease of use in shallow areas, their high-resolution data, and straightforward data processing. However, the distinctive characteristics of sparker data introduce specific challenges in the processing of single-channel seismic datasets. These include (i) unavailability of the stacking process for single-channel seismic data, (ii) inability to derive subsurface velocity distribution from single-channel seismic profiles, (iii) limitations imposed by ghost reflections and bubble effects as well as random noise amplitudes, and (iv) the suitability of only predictive deconvolution for suppressing multiple reflections. Applications demonstrate that the inability to apply the stacking process to single-channel seismic data poses a significant challenge in suppressing both random and coherent noise, and increasing the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The F-X prediction filter has proven highly effective in mitigating random noise in sparker data. Appropriate determination of operator length and prediction lag parameters allows predictive deconvolution to effectively suppress multiple reflections, despite some residual multiple amplitudes in the output. Spiking deconvolution significantly eliminates ghost reflections and bubble effects, enhancing temporal resolution by eliminating the ringy appearance of the input signal. Trace mixing is a crucial data processing step for enhancing sparker data resolution. The method can be applied as weighted mix for random noise suppression or as trimmed mix for suppressing high-amplitude spike-like noises. This study incorporates a comprehensive analysis of the various noise components embedded in sparker seismic data. It delineates the processing flow and parameters utilized to effectively mitigate these specific noise types.",

The projects employed different hydrological models over different spatial domains. The semi-distributed, process-based, SWAT model was used in the CHASE-PL project for the entire Vistula and Odra basins area, whilst the lumped, conceptual, HBV model was used in the CHIHE project for eight Polish catchments, for which the comparison study was made. Climate projections in both studies originated from the common EURO-CORDEX dataset, but they were different, e.g. due to different bias correction approaches. Increases in mean annual and seasonal flows were projected in both studies, yet the magnitudes of changes were largely different, in particular for the lowland catchments in the far future. The HBV-based increases were significantly higher in the latter case than the SWAT-based increases in all seasons except winter. Uncertainty in projections is high and creates a problem for practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal changes of the primary and secondary microseisms were analysed in the wavefield of the ambient noise recorded during the entire 2014 at the “13 BB star” array located in northern Poland, composed of thirteen, symmetrically arranged, broadband seismic stations. To that, spectral analysis, seismic interferometry, surface scalar wind speed distribution, and beamforming were used. Spectral analysis allowed to observe that a splitting of the secondary microseism peak was present in winter and autumn, and that the primary microseism peak was visible in spring, summer and autumn. Using seismic interferometry, the long-term characteristics of the noise wavefield were recognized. The seasonal variations of the secondary microseism source were described by means of the analysis of the surface scalar wind speed for each month. The splitting of the secondary peak was attributed to the interaction of a strong wind blowing from the North Sea with a weak wind blowing from the Baltic Sea. The seasonal variations of the primary microseism peak were characterized through the frequency-domain beamforming. The peak was identified during spring, summer and autumn, when the generated wavefield was coming from the Baltic Sea. The velocity of the wavefield was evaluated within the 2.0–5.0 km/s range. The described mechanism of generation of the microseisms, based on the interaction of the nearby winds, was found to be consistent with the models reported in the literature.",

The resultant crevices may allow for an undesired and hazardous fluid migration. We studied the fracture linking problem on data from a part of The Geysers geothermal field in California, USA. We parameterized seismic events by the distance between hypocenter and injecting well, by the angle between the position vector of hypocentre and the maximum horizontal stress direction and by the angle of rotation required to turn the event's double-couple mechanism into the prevailing in this area faults' orientation. To make these parameters comparable, we transformed them to equivalent dimensions. Based on distances between events in the transformed parameter space, we divided the seismic events into clusters. The percentage of potentially linked fractures in clusters was greater at low than at high injection rate.",

    "abstract": "Thermal history of Mimas and Enceladus is investigated from the beginning of accretion to 400 Myr. The numerical model of convection combined with the parameterized theory is used. The following heat sources are included: short lived and long lived radioactive isotopes, accretion, serpentinization, and phase changes. The heat transfer processes are: conduction, solid state convection, and liquid state convection. We find that temperature of Mimas' interior was significantly lower than that of Enceladus. If Mimas accreted 1.8 Myr after CAI then the internal melting and differentiation did not occur at all. Comparison of thermal models of Mimas and Enceladus indicates that conditions favorable for the start of tidal heating lasted for a short time (~107 yr) in Mimas and for ~108 yr in Enceladus. This could explain the Mimas—Enceladus paradox. In fact, in view of the chronology based on cometary impact rate, one cannot discard a possibility that also Mimas was for some time active and it has the interior differentiated on porous core and icy mantle.",

    "abstract": "The electrical anisotropy of rocks is generally an effect of alternating layers of thin-bedded sandstones and shales with clear lamination. Thin-bedded rock sequences can be treated as an anisotropic medium described by two resistivities: horizontally to the bedding R H and vertically to the bedding R V . Such sequences have fairly low resistivity and, as a result of poor vertical resolution of conventional electric tools, one can sometimes fail to distinguish them from the adjoining shales. This paper presents the possibility of calculating the anisotropy parameters based on resistivity logs recorded with a laterolog tool (DLL) and an induction tool HRAI. We have also performed an analysis of the ambiguity of the results and attempts to assess the water saturation (SW) generating cross-plots based on calculated resistivities, R H and R V . It is very important to correctly evaluate the resistivity of sandstone interbeds when calculating water saturation (SW) and hydrocarbon saturation (SG), in formulating an integrated quantitative interpretation of anisotropic formations.",

In order to achieve this, two objective catalogues, namely GWT and WLK, from COST733 Action were employed. Daily circulation types were grouped according to the cyclonicity and anticyclonicity and were used to calculate the seasonal occurrence frequency of cyclonic and anticyclonic types. The trend of seasonal time series was investigated by using Mann–Kendall test and the shifts points were determined by using Pettitt test. The results reveal that the occurrence frequency of anti-cyclonic types increases in summer and winter seasons and the occurrence frequency of cyclonic ones decreases for the summer season (for alpha = 0.05).",

The reservoir of 234.5 million m3 capacity is shallow, between 20 to 50 m of water column, on average. Until 2011 the seismic activity in this region was sparse, some 1 event trimonthly. However, in November 2011 more than 60 events occurred. Such bursts of activity, separated by low activity periods, continue to appear. Since August 2013 the area is monitored by a local seismic network. The setup allows to accurately locate the epicenters and to determine source mechanisms for stronger events. The events are clustered and aligned along NE-SW direction and their mechanisms are very similar, indicating N-S strike slip faulting. This and the irregular pattern of activity suggest that this seismicity is triggered by the reservoir impoundment.",

Theoretical expressions of the additional stress and local stress are derived based on the Maxwell model. Core disking which takes place under the condition that the axial stress is rapidly reduced while the confining pressure is kept unchanged is explained with a new method. Unloading duration’s effect on core disking is analyzed. A new criterion for core disking is presented based on attributing the core disking to the result of the exceedance of local tensile stress over the tensile strength. Based on our theoretical analysis and the conclusions from published resources, core disking is most likely to occur if the maximum principal stress is more than five to six times the tensile strength.",

Therefore, it is more suitable for the interface identification of logging sequence strata. Well logging data reflect rich geological information and belong to non-linear and non-stationary signals and EMD method can deal with non-stationary and non-linear signals very well. By selecting sensitive parameters combination that reflects the regional geological structure and lithology, the combined parameter can be decomposed through EMD method to study the correlation and the physical meaning of each intrinsic mode function. Meanwhile, it identifies the stratigraphy and cycle sequence perfectly and provides an effective signal treatment method for sequence interface.",

However, it is necessary to carry out a decomposition of the sediment transport into transport in onshore direction during wave crest and offshore direction during wave trough. Further, the shape of bed erosion in response to sediment transport coincides with the trapezoid envelope or with part of it, when some sediments still remain within it.

The investigations which have been performed for several years distinguished high energy mine tremors connected directly with mining or coupled with geological structures, such as large faults. In mined seams, local fault zones occur. Faults in these zones are usually small, with throws comparable with coal seams thicknesses. Local fault zone may be responsible for the occurrence of high energy tremors as well as large faults, as presented in this article. An analysis of source mechanism of high energy tremors generated during longwall mining of the coal seam No. 510, with presence of a local fault zone, in one of the Polish hard coal mines in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin was performed. For this purpose, the seismic moment tensor inversion method was used. In most of foci, the process of shear predominated. Determined nodal plane parameters were correlated with parameters of faults forming the local fault zone. High energy tremors were generated mostly by dislocations on faults of the local fault zone. Weakening of roof rocks in the neighborhood of local fault zone takes an important role too, and was responsible for share of implosion in the focal mechanism.",

Validation of TSEB1 versus ground measurements showed RMSD values of 28 and 10 Wm−2 for sensible and latent heat fluxes, respectively. Reasonable agreement between TSEB1 and TSEB2I was found, but a rather low correlation between TSEB1 and TSEB2D was observed.

The study shows that genetic algorithm has automatically segmented the dark spot patches related to small and large oil spill pixels. This conclusion is confirmed by the receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve and ground data which have been documented. The ROC curve indicates that the existence of oil slick footprints can be identified with the area under the curve between the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line of 90%, which is greater than that of other surrounding environmental features. The small oil spill sizes represented 30% of the discriminated oil spill pixels in ROC curve. In conclusion, the genetic algorithm can be used as a tool for the automatic detection of oil spills of either small or large size and the ScanSAR Narrow single beam mode serves as an excellent sensor for oil spill patterns detection and surveying in the Gulf of Mexico.",

One of the most important requirements of elastic RTM is to solve wave equations. The imaging accuracy and efficiency of RTM depends heavily on the algorithms used for solving wave equations. In this paper, we propose an efficient staggered-grid finite-difference (SFD) scheme based on a sampling approximation method with adaptive variable difference operator lengths to implement elastic prestack RTM. Numerical dispersion analysis and wavefield extrapolation results show that the sampling approximation SFD scheme has greater accuracy than the conventional Taylor-series expansion SFD scheme. We also test the elastic RTM algorithm on theoretical models and a field data set, respectively. Experiments presented demonstrate that elastic RTM using the proposed SFD scheme can generate better images than that using the Taylor-series expansion SFD scheme, particularly for PS images.

The total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) contents and distribution characteristics of sediment samples were examined. The results showed that the TOC concentration ranged from 3.81 to 15.6 g/kg, the TN concentration ranged from 0.21 to 1.18 g/kg with a mean concentration of 0.66 g/kg, and the TP concentration ranged from 0.16 to 0.35 g/kg with a mean of 0.23 g/kg. Statistical analysis showed close correlations between TOC and TN (R2 = 0.96), and TN and TP (R2 = 0.97), which indicated that the TN and TP in the sediments were from similar sources. The concentrations of TOC, TN, and TP in Longbao Lake wetland sediments were too low for eutrophication to occur. Our investigation indicated that Longbao Lake undergoes natural evolution rather than anthropogenic activities.",

The AE count rate, cumulative AE count, AE energy, and amplitude of the sandstone samples were determined. Then, the relationships among the AE signals and shearing behaviors of the samples were analyzed in order to detect micro-crack initiation and propagation and reflect shear failure. The results indicated that both the shear strength and displacement exhibited a logarithmic relationship with the displacement rate at peak levels of stress. In addition, the various characteristics of the AE signals were apparent in various situations. The AE signals corresponded with the shear stress under different displacement rates. As the displacement rate increased, the amount of accumulative damage to each specimen decreased, while the AE energy peaked earlier and more significantly. The cumulative AE count primarily increased during the post-peak period. Furthermore, the AE count rate and amplitude exhibited two peaks during the peak shear stress period due to crack coalescence and rock bridge breakage. These isolated cracks later formed larger fractures and eventually caused ruptures.",

Measurements of induced seis-micity in the Legnica-Głogów Copper District were used in this study. Various sets of input variables were tested. The basic variables used in every case were seismic energy and epicentral distance, while the additional variables were the location of the epicenter, the location of the seismic station, and the direction towards the epicenter. The GRNN improves the GMPE. The best results were obtained when the epicenter location was used as an additional input. The GRNN model was analysed for how it can improve the GMPE with respect to LR. The bootstrap resampling method was used for this purpose. It proved the statistical significance of the improvement of the GMPE. Additionally, this method allows the determination of smoothness parameters for the GRNN. Parameters derived through this method have better generalisation capabilities than the smoothness parameters estimated using the holdout method.",

In particularly unfavorable local conditions, seismic profiling, active/passive seismic tomography, as well as analytical state of stress calculating methods are recommended. They are helpful in verifying the reliability of rockburst hazard forecasts. In the article, the combined analysis of the state of stress determined by active seismic tomography and analytical modeling was conducted taking into account the relationship between the location of stress concentration zones and the level of rockburst hazard. A longwall panel in the coal seam 501 at a depth of ca.700 m in one of the hard coal mines operating in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin was a subject of the analysis. The seismic tomography was applied for the reconstruction of P-wave velocity fields. The analytical modeling was used to calculate the vertical stress states basing on classical solutions offered by rock mechanics. The variability of the P-wave velocity field and location of seismic anomaly in the coal seam in relation to the calculated vertical stress field arising in the mined coal seam served to assess of rockburst hazard. The applied methods partially proved their adequacy in practical applications, providing valuable information on the design and performance of mining operations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Establishing and operating a harmonized sediment monitoring system along large rivers such as the Danube River is a challenging international task. As an element of such a system, a new monitoring site with state-of-the-art instrumentation is currently under development in the Upper-Hungarian section of the Danube River. The monitoring station will consist of a near-bank optical backscatter sensor and a horizontal acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP). As previous studies showed, the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) that is continuously measured with near-bank sensors can significantly enhance the temporal resolution of sediment transport monitoring. However, sediment plumes from tributary inflows upstream of the monitoring station can alter the detected near-bank concentrations, eventually biasing the sediment load estimation. Such an influence is likely in the cross-section of the planned monitoring station, therefore, a thorough preliminary analysis of the cross-sectional variation of the SSC was performed, based on expeditionary sediment measurement campaigns. Between 2018 and 2021 24 campaigns were carried out at different hydrological regimes, where physical sediment samplings together with fixed and moving boat ADCP measurements were performed. The cross-sectional variability of SSC and its influence on the sediment load estimations were assessed based on the moving boat ADCP measurements, after calibrating the backscatter signal with more than 500 physical samples. Based on the results, we identified different cross-sectional patterns of the SSC which is apparently governed by: (i) the actual hydrological situation considering both the main river and the tributary, and (ii) the local river morphology. Based on our findings, we suggested a correction method that accounts for the above effects, using which the near-bank SSC can be reliably converted into total suspended sediment load.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Unconsolidated sediments can amplify ground motions, increasing seismic hazard. Horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios can derive the thickness of sediments overlaying stiffer bedrock. However, additional information about shear velocities and calibration with other structural information is necessary. Here, we propose a strictly ambient seismic noise-based workflow that can map the depth of sediments without additional information from other data sources. Rayleigh wave dispersion curves and ellipticities are derived from three-component beamforming of ambient noise and combined with dispersion curves from six-component measurements and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios. This is used to calibrate empirical relations between frequencies of extreme points in spectral ratio curves with depths of sediments. Applying the relations to more than forty seismic station data, we can map the depth of the Tertiary sediments at the southern margin of the lower Rhine embayment, Germany.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Floods pose significant risks to human life and the economy. This study presents a hybrid artificial intelligence approach designed to assess flood risk and improve risk management. The proposed model minimizes dataset complexity and optimizes performance by using 2D deep learning networks, allowing for more detailed feature extraction. The approach converts 1D data into 2D grayscale images as a preprocessing step, enabling the use of deep learning models that operate on 2D data. To ensure efficiency, mobile deep networks, including MobileNetV2 and NasNetMobile, were selected due to their lower computational requirements, making them suitable for hardware deployment. Feature sets were extracted from the final layers of the models and combined into a set of 2000 features. Machine learning classifiers (kNN, LDA, SVM) were used to assess the level of flood risk. The best performing method, LDA, was selected for further analysis. Feature selection techniques, Chi2 and Kruskal–Wallis, were used to refine the feature set and identify the most relevant features. The intersection of the features selected by both methods resulted in 767 features, optimizing both performance and computational efficiency. The LDA method achieved an accuracy of 99.86%, and in cross-validation tests, an accuracy of 99.68%. These results demonstrate that the integration of deep learning models with feature selection techniques significantly improves the accuracy of flood risk prediction while reducing time and hardware costs.

    "abstract": "Predicting how pollutants disperse in vegetation is necessary to protect natural watercourses. This can be done using the one-dimensional advection dispersion equation, which requires estimates of longitudinal dispersion coefficients in vegetation. Dye tracing was used to obtain longitudinal dispersion coefficients in emergent artificial vegetation of different densities and stem diameters. Based on these results, a simple non-dimensional model, depending on velocity and stem spacing, was developed to predict the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in uniform emergent vegetation at low densities (solid volume fractions < 0.1). Predictions of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient from this simple model were compared with predictions from a more complex expression for a range of experimental data, including real vegetation. The simple model was found to predict correct order of magnitude dispersion coefficients and to perform as well as the more complex expression. The simple model requires fewer parameters and provides a robust engineering approximation.",

    "abstract": "Several researches published comprehensive reports on dynamic soil properties of cohesive soils, in which many of them outlined, i.e., key factors affecting the dynamic shear modulus. For cohesive soils, the modulus at small strains (g < 10t-3 %) is, first of all, a function of void ratio and effective confining stress. For clays, however, secondary time effects and clay mineralogy (fabric and structure) also appear to be important. The influence of confinement of laboratory-prepared as well as naturally deposited clays consists in an increase of shear modulus logarithmically as a function of time. In this paper, the effect of duration of the various confining pressures on dynamic shear modulus (G) of selected cohesive soils from Warsaw area was evaluated. Shear modulus was determined on the basis of resonant column tests, at low and high shearing strain amplitudes. It is shown that the calculated shear modulus is time-dependent; during approximately first 1000 minutes of consolidation, the moduli increased by almost 50%. Moreover, it is characterized by two phases: an initial one results from primary consolidation and a second one, which occurs after the end of primary consolidation, herein about 16-17 hours, and is called \"long-term time effect\". This effect was found also for modulus at higher shearing strains (γ > 103%, e.g., 3 × 103%, 5 × 103%, 8 × 103%, 2 × 103%).",

During the period of ten days, measurements were made to capture the main processes controlling the local and regional land-atmosphere exchanges. Apart from multi-temporal, multi-directional and multi-spatial space-borne and airborne observations, measurements of the local meteorology, energy fluxes, soil temperature profiles, soil moisture profiles, surface temperature, canopy structure as well as leaf-level measurements were carried out. Additional thermo-dynamical monitoring took place at selected sites. After presenting the different types of measurements, some examples are given to illustrate the potential of the observations made.",

Geological and hydrogeological models were performed using the stratigraphical data from 51 wells. A ground-water flow (direction and velocity) model was obtained. Using the same wells data, the ground-water annual temperature was modeled. Furthermore, the ground surface temperature records from ten meteorological stations were studied. This allowed us to obtain a model related to the variations of the temperature at different depths in the subsoil. Integrated geophysical surveys were carried out in order to explore the low-enthalpy geothermal fluids and to evaluate the results of the model. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and self-potential (SP) methods were used. The results obtained upon integrating the geophysical data with the models show a low-enthalpy geothermal resource constituted by a shallow ground-water system.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports an experimental study of the evolution of permeability during rock brittle failure and a theoretical analysis of rock critical stress level. It is assumed that the rock is a strain-softening medium whose strength can be described by Weibull's distribution. Based on the two-dimensional renormalization group theory, it is found that the stress level λc (the ratio of the stress at the critical point to the peak stress) depends mainly on the homogeneity index or shape parameter m in the Weibull's distribution for the rock. Experimental results show that the evolution of permeability is closely related to rock deformation stages: the permeability has a rapid increase with the growth of cracks and their surface areas (i.e., onset of fracture coalescence point), and reaches the maximum at rock failure. Both the experimental and analytical results show that this point of rapid increase in permeability on the permeability-pressure curve corresponds to the critical point on the stress-strain curve; for rock compression, the stress at this point is approximately 80% of the peak strength. Thus, monitoring the evolution of permeability may provide a new means of identifying the critical point of rock brittle fracture.",

Second, the theorem on the characteristic functions of probability distributions which Gauss called Ein Sch\\\"ones Theorem der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (beautiful theorem of probability calculus).

Considering borehole data, when the need arises to supplement a missing well log interval or whole logging—ANNs provide a reliable solution. Supervised training of the network on a reliable set of borehole data values with further application of this network on unknown wells allows creation of synthetic values of missing geophysical parameters, e.g., resistivity. The main assumptions for boreholes are: representation of similar geological conditions and the use of similar techniques of well data collection. In the analyzed case, a set of Multilayer Perceptrons were trained on five separate chronostratigraphic intervals of borehole, considered as training data. The task was to predict missing deep laterolog (LLD) logging in a borehole representing the same sequence of layers within the Lublin Basin area. Correlation between well logs data exceeded 0.8. Subsequently, magnetotelluric parametric soundings were modeled and inverted on both boreholes. Analysis showed that congenial Occam 1D models had better fitting of TM mode of MT data in each case. Ipso facto, synthetic LLD log could be considered as a basis for geophysical and geological interpretation. ANNs provided solution for supplementing datasets based on this analytical approach.",

    "abstract": "Due to several complexities associated with the equatorial ionosphere, and the significant role which the total electron content (TEC) variability plays in GPS signal transmission, there is the need to monitor irregularities in TEC during storm events. The GPS SCINDA receiver data at Ile-Ife, Nigeria, was analysed with a view to characterizing the ionospheric response to geomagnetic storms on 9 March and 1 October 2012. Presently, positive storm effects, peaks in TEC which were associated with prompt penetration of electric fields and changes in neutral gas composition were observed for the storms. The maximum percentage deviation in TEC of about 120 and 45% were observed for 9 March and 1 October 2012, respectively. An obvious negative percentage TEC deviation subsequent to sudden storm commencement (SSC) was observed and besides a geomagnetic storm does not necessarily suggest a high scintillation intensity (S4) index. The present results show that magnetic storm events at low latitude regions may have an adverse effect on navigation and communication systems.",

    "abstract": "The installation of free falling jet grade control structures has become a popular choice for river bed stabilization. However, the formation and development of scour downstream of the structure may lead to failure of the structure itself. The current approaches to scour depth prediction are generally based on studies conducted with the absence of upward seepage. In the present study, the effects of upward seepage on the scour depth were investigated. A total of 78 tests without and with the application of upward seepage were carried out using three different sediment sizes, three different tailwater depths, four different flow discharges, and four different upward seepage flow discharge rates. In some tests, the three-dimensional components of the flow velocity within the scour hole were measured for both the cases with and without upward seepage. The scour depth measured for the no-seepage results compared well with the most accurate relationship found in the literature. It was found that generally the upward seepage reduced the downward velocity components near the bed, which led to a decrease in the maximum scour depth. A maximum scour depth reduction of 49% was found for a minimum tailwater depth, small sediment size, and high flow discharge. A decay of the downward velocity vector within the jet impingement was found due to the upward seepage flow velocity. The well known equation of D'Agostino and Ferro was modified to account for the effect of upward seepage, which satisfactorily predicted the experimental scour depth, with a reasonable average error of 10.7%.",

In this paper, an efficient symplectic scheme, called Leapfrog-Rapid Expansion Method (L-REM), is first introduced to extrapolate the wavefield and its derivative in the same time step with high accuracy and free numerical dispersion using a Ricker wavelet of a maximum frequency of 25 Hz. Afterwards, in order to suppress the artifacts as a characteristic of RTM, a new imaging condition based on Poynting vector and a type of weighting function is presented. The capability of the proposed new imaging condition is then tested on synthetic data. The obtained results indicate that the proposed imaging condition is able to suppress the RTM artifacts effectively. They also show the ability of the proposed approach for improving the amplitude and compensate for illumination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Sinai Peninsula is a subplate located between the African and Arabian plates. It is an important subplate in the world; however, this region is poorly understood because of the shortage of geophysical data. Thus, this study focuses on built a three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution forward model of the crustal thickness with a new tectonic model and structural evaluation of the Sinai Peninsula to understand this area tectonically and determine its lithospheric and crustal thicknesses. Qualitative and quantitative interpretations of Bouguer gravity, reduced-to-the-pole (RTP) aeromagnetic, and earthquake data are explained to achieve the goals of this study. Two-dimensional (2D) interactive sequential modeling of gravity data is performed along with some well-selected profiles with existing crustal layer depth points from previous works in the studied region. Seventeen 2D models are constructed and used to determine the basement, Conrad (lower crust boundary), and Moho (upper mantle boundary) depths and to build a 3D model. Accuracy of the 3D built model is evaluated by extracting observed, calculated, and residual gravity anomaly maps. The results show that the basement rocks appear on the surface in the South of Sinai and deepen (down to 4.5 km) toward the North. The Conrad surface varies approximately from 16 km (in the northeast and southwest of Sinai) to 22.8 km (in the southeast). The Moho surface depth (i.e., crustal thickness) varies approximately from 28.8 to 34.2 km, and it deepens toward the northeastern and southwestern parts of Sinai. A tentative basement structure map is constructed from the horizontal gradient (H-gradient) filter and the 3D Euler deconvolution of the Bouguer gravity and RTP aeromagnetic data. Correlation between the geological background of the study area and the obtained results suggests that the Sinai Peninsula is tectonically active, mainly in its southern portion due to the tectonic movements along the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba. The crustal thickness increases southward and thins northward.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The upwelling of fluids, subject to overpressure, along with discontinuities in the subsoil, causes the formation of geological structures known as mud volcanoes. These structures, very widespread in the world and in some cases located near inhabited centers, can represent a considerable risk factor for the population, as they can give rise to paroxysmal eruptions, even very violent. The assessment of the characteristics and structure of the subsoil of the areas affected by this phenomenon can prove to be a useful tool for risk mitigation. Non-invasive geophysical surveys were carried out in the area of the active cone of the Santa Barbara mud volcano in order to obtain a 3D characterization of the subsoil. Through the processing and integration of data derived from active and passive seismic surveys was obtained, a 3D model showing the seismostratigraphic subsoil structure. The electrical resistivity tomography surveys provided results comparable to those obtained from seismic surveys and supplied information on the perimetral areas of the mud volcano. The information obtained is useful to study the boundary conditions that influence short-scale activity. Furthermore, this study seeks to evaluate the possibility of using the proposed methodological approach for monitoring the variations that occur over time in the areas affected by mud volcanoes phenomenon.",

The results showed that both reanalysis datasets have a strong correlation with the observed variables, except with dew point temperature and relative humidity in the upper troposphere. The mean values of geopotential height and temperature from both grid dataset are generally consistent with the radiosonde values, whereas considerable bias in the mean Td and RH exists and increases upwards. The study clearly proved that the reanalysis datasets can be used to compensate for the lack of radiosonde observation. Furthermore, air temperature (during 1959–2021) showed an increasing trend from the surface to the lower troposphere, while the temperature decreased in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Finally in this study, the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) on the air temperature was also examined, and a negative relationship was found between NAOI and temperature at the levels: surface, 850, 700, and 500 hPa, while a positive relationship was found, only in winter, at 200 hPa. At the level of 100 hPa, the correlation is positive for both seasons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The 6 February 2023 Mw 7.7–7.6 Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence has significantly impacted the East Anatolian Fault zone, including the city of Malatya and its immediate surroundings. In addition to the aftershocks of February 2023, the Mw 5.9 Kale earthquake that occurred on October 16, 2024, further underscores the ongoing seismic activity in the region. This study analyzes the distribution of b -values derived from a comprehensive dataset comprising 14,549 earthquakes and the Coulomb stress variations associated with the aftershocks of the February 2023 sequence and the Kale earthquake. The primary objective of this analysis is to enhance the understanding of the tectonic setting that contributed to the occurrence of the Kale earthquake. The findings indicate that the low b -values and stress transfer through the Pütürge segment toward the unnamed fault near Kale are significant contributing factors to the occurrence of the Kale earthquake. Additionally, positive stress variations from Doğanşehir to Malatya’s city center suggest a potential fault oriented toward the city center that may increase the current earthquake hazard. Furthermore, the distribution of seismic events around Malatya suggests a possible barrier supported by previous magnetic data analysis between Malatya and Kale. Lastly, the observed stress variations for the Kale earthquake indicate the likelihood of upcoming seismic events in both the northeast and southwest directions of the Kale.",

Estimations were performed for rotational and translational signals using waveforms from mining-induced seismic events. The amplification curves were estimated for each case of the axis rotation using the Fourier Spectrum Amplitude (FSA) and the Response Spectrum Analysis (RSA). Estimating the amplification spectrum for the rotated horizontal components is a method that allows determining the directional amplification effect, connected with the local anisotropy and fault occurrence. The Quaternary fault presence characterises the closest proximity of the station. Therefore, the surveys assumed analysis of the possibility and limitations of the directional amplification effect estimation by using records of rotational and translational motion as well as both approaches of the H/V estimation. The comparisons presented the limitation of the RSA approach in estimating the rotational H/V curve, which was an effect of the sensor settings on the pedestal. The directional amplification effect presented a perpendicular orientation to the close-distance fault, similar to rotational and translational motion analysis assuming the FSA approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accurate estimation of bed shear stress is crucial for understanding sediment transport and morphodynamic processes in fluvial and environmental flows. Shear plates offer a direct measurement approach that avoids the restrictive flow assumptions of many indirect methods. However, their broader use has been limited by misconceptions and concerns about measurement uncertainty. This study addresses these challenges by applying uncertainty analysis based on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), specifically adapted to quantify and evaluate the reliability of shear plate measurements. Experiments were conducted under three hydraulically complex conditions: propeller-induced jets, flow through rigid emergent vegetation, and flexible vegetation over three-dimensional bedforms. Results show that shear plates consistently deliver low relative uncertainties, with over 70% of measurements below 10% and 44% below 5%. The dominant sources of uncertainty were associated with experimental conditions, particularly flow non-uniformity and the need to estimate vegetation drag, while contributions from the measurement instrumentation itself remained minor. Comparisons were made with the traditional gravity method, an indirect approach that estimates bed shear stress based on the energy slope within a control volume. Shear plates provided more accurate and reliable estimates, particularly in vegetated flows where local gradients compromise slope-based calculations. This study demonstrates the practical value of applying the GUM framework in experimental hydraulics, promoting greater confidence in shear plate measurements.",

In this paper, an analysis of the occurrence process of mining-induced seismic events from Rudna copper mine in Poland is presented. Stationarity and internal correlation are investigated in complete seismic time series and segmentally in subseries demonstrating relatively stable seismicity rates. It is shown that the complete seismic series are non-stationary; however, most of their shorter subseries become stationary. In the stationary subseries, the distribution of interevent time is closer to the exponential distribution, which is characteristic for the Poisson process. However, in most of these subseries, the differences between the interevent time and Poisson distributions are still significant, revealing correlations among seismic events.",

Additionally, depositional sequences like prograding deltas and braided rivers have been plotted onto the rock physics template to illustrate the effect of changing shale volume. Carbonates below the basin have been included into the study and results from previous projects, based on laboratory data and petrophysical models on certain lithologies in the Vienna Basin, have been used to compare the outcome. The result is a rock physics template which includes important properties such as porosity, true vertical depth and fluid type from log data and which is considered useable throughout different areas and various lithologies of the Vienna Basin.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate trends and regime changes in streamflow and basic factors driving these changes. The investigated area is located in central Poland and is influenced by temperate transitional climate. New insight is provided into the phenomenon of past climate-driven changes to streamflow patterns over a 65-year period (1951–2015). The Mann–Kendall test for monotonic trends and the CUSUM test are used to determine the presence or absence of changes in climatic variables, shallow groundwater level, and streamflow. Time series are explored to detect the direction of trends and the period when the significant change occurred. Differences in climatic conditions and streamflow patterns are discussed for two sub-periods, before and after the change. Overall, the results suggest stability in precipitation, with limited evidence for change in the annual amount, but reveal a significant change in streamflow regime in the 1980s, attributed to higher temperature driving evapotranspiration and reducing shallow groundwater recharge. It is concluded that the catchment is prone to increased evapotranspiration and in effect to greatly reduced runoff.",

    "abstract": "Public concerns have been raised regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas extraction and its potential impact on the environment. The absence of baseline monitoring data in the US experience has been identified as a major issue. Here, results from a 6-month groundwater baseline monitoring study near an active shale gas pad in northern Poland are presented. The data collected in dedicated boreholes include groundwater samples analysed for inorganic constituents, dissolved gases and stables isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) and downhole temperature and conductivity measurements at 15-min intervals. A robust statistical analysis combined with an estimation of data uncertainty helps to identify spatial and temporal variability within the datasets. As a result, baseline conditions are defined using confidence intervals around the mean on a per-well basis and these will serve for future reference for this site. The groundwater chemical composition is similar to regional background levels and typical of Quaternary aquifers in the region. It is also consistent with previous baseline monitoring carried out by the Polish Geological Institute. Only manganese and bromide occur in groundwater at concentrations above Polish drinking water standards. Based on this work, the paper provides some recommendations for future baseline monitoring and identifies areas for future research such as use of statistics for high-frequency datasets.",

Geological material consists of 31 samples of tight, gas-bearing, clastic rocks from different wells and formations. The purpose was to parametrize in detail the pore structure, revealing the relationships between the various parameters and estimating the equation for assessing the fluid flow ability of analyzed tight rocks. Following parameters were taken into consideration in the pore space characterization: thickness mean, equivalent diameter, anisotropy, elongation, sphericity, Feret diameter, Feret coefficient, Feret shape; shape factors: 2nd circularity coefficient, Malinowska coefficient and Danielsson coefficient; as well as parameters from 3D skeleton analysis: junctions, branches, coordination number. It was captured the dependence of logarithmic T2 mean from NMR on junction count from CT, as well as T2 cutoff from NMR on elongation from CT for the all samples. Logarithm of absolute permeability was estimated based on multiple linear regression analysis using only geometrical parameters from X-ray nanotomography, which is a benefit in the times of coring material decrease.",

    "abstract": "Several data sets from the Silurian and Ordovician formations from three wells on the shore of Baltic Basin in Northern Poland prepared on the basis of well logging data and results of their comprehensive interpretation were used in factor analysis. The goal of statistical analysis was structure recognition of data and proper selection of parameters to limit the number of variables in study. The top priority of research was recognition of specific features of claystone/mudstone formations predisposing them to be potential shale gas deposits. The identified data scheme based on data from one well, was then applied to: 1) well 2 and well 3 separately, 2) combined data from three wells, 3) depth intervals treated as sweet spots, i.e., formations of high hydrocarbon potential. Numbers of samples from well logging were proportional to number of laboratory data from individual formations. The extended data set comprising all available log samples in explored formations was also prepared. Outcomes from standard (Triple Combo—natural gamma log, resistivity log, neutron log and bulk density log and Quad Combo—with addition of sonic log and spectral gamma log) and sophisticated (GEM™—Elemental Analysis Tool, Wave Sonic and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—NMR) logs were the basis for data sets. Finally, laboratory data set of huge amount of variables from elemental, mineralogical, geochemical and petrophysical laboratory experiments was built and verified in FA to select the most informative components. Conclusions on the data set size, number of factors and type of variables were drawn.",

Effective, efficient, and reliability interpretation of GPR field data obtained from clandestine sites is very crucial in forensic investigations. The main goal of the study is the prediction of the change in the interaction of the electromagnetic incident on changes in buried bodies with time. In order to achieve this, the research involves the modeling of the GPR electromagnetic pulse energy responses to simulated changes in buried body with time with a view to understand what the results of real field measurement will give. The field measurements were conducted with GPR system manufactured by Mala Geoscience with antennae frequency of 500 MHz, 250 MHz, and 100 MHz. Responses from both synthetic and field radargrams depict the target was intercepted at same time (approximately 25 ns). The results have demonstrated that FDTD modeling is an important tool for enhancing the reliability of GPR data interpretation particularly for forensic study.",

The aim of the research was to determine whether, and to what extent, the microgravity method can be used to detect and image a coal gasification zone, especially caverns where the coal was burnt out. In theory, the effects of coal gasification process create caverns and cracks, e.g., zones of altered bulk density. Before the measurements, theoretical density models of completely and partially gasified coal were analysed. Results of the calculations of gravity field response showed that in both cases on the surface over the gasification zone there should be local gravimetric anomalies. Over the geo reactor, two series of gravimetric measurements prior to and after gasification were conducted. Comparison of the results of two measurement series revealed the presence of gravimetric anomalies that could be related to the cavern formation process. Data from these measurements were used to verify theoretical models. After the experiment, a small cavern was detected at the depth of the coal seam by the test borehole drilled in one of the anomalous areas.",

    "abstract": "While it is well-known that texture can be used to classify very high resolution (VHR) data, the limits of its applicability have not been unequivocally specified. This study examines whether it is possible to divide satellite images into two classes associated with \"low\" and \"high\" texture values in the initial stage of processing VHR images. This approach can be effectively used in object-oriented classification. Based on the panchromatic channel of KOMPSAT-2 images from five areas of Europe, datasets with down-sampled pixel resolutions of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 m were prepared. These images were processed using different texture analysis techniques in order to discriminate between basic land cover classes. Results were assessed using the normalized feature space distance expressed by the Jeffries–Matusita distance. The best results were observed for images with the highest resolution processed by the Laplacian filter. Our research shows that a classification approach based on the idea of \"low\" and \"high\" textures can be effectively applied to panchromatic data with a resolution of 8 m or higher.",

The method is based on fractional wavelet transform (FRWT), which is similar to the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT). It can represent signals in the fractional domain, and has the advantages of multi-resolution analysis as the wavelet transform (WT). The fractional wavelet transform can process the reflective chirp signal as pulse seismic signal and decompose it into multi-resolution domain to denoise. Compared with other methods, FRWT can offer wavelet transform for signal analysis in the timefractional-frequency plane which is suitable for processing vibratory seismic data. It can not only achieve better denoising performance, but also improve the quality and continuity of the reflection syncphase axis.",

The energy balance closure ratio (EBR) was 105% for a homogeneous camelina site, 86% at a sparse reforestation site, and 73% for a vineyard. We hypothesize that the lower closure in the last site was related to the limited fetch. Incorporating a vertical gradient of soil thermal properties decreased the RMSE of the energy balance at the camelina site by 16 W m−2. At the camelina site, eddy covariance estimates of sensible and latent heat fluxes could be reproduced well using mean vertical profiles of wind and temperature, provided that the Monin—Obukhov length is known. Measured surface temperature and sensible heat fluxes suggested high excess resistance for heat (kB−1 = 17).",

Therefore, additional ways, such as correlations with other properties to derive the petrophysical parameter, will be an advantage. The research presented here continues and improves the petrographic-coded model concept with an increased set of data, including a variety of lithologies, and, furthermore, the correlations, including the electrical resistivity. Input parameters are no longer taken from the literature, but are derived directly from measurements. In addition, the results are compared with other published approaches. Results show good correlations with measured data. The comparison with the multi-linear regression method shows acceptable outcome, in contrast to a geometric-mean method, where data scatter. In summary, it can be said that the improved model delivers for both correlation (compressional wave velocity and electrical resistivity with thermal conductivity) positive results.",

In this work, we focused on strong and potential mining-induced seismic doublets, our study was using concepts of signal analysis, using an in-mine network with quite low dynamic range. Since in such case records for strong events are usually affected by clipping, signal analysis were performed with both raw signal cross-correlation (CC) and binary signal cross-correlation (BCC). We found that for events which fulfilled the established criteria, waveform similarities are significantly higher than for other possible doublets. Using BCC and CC approaches, we noticed crucial influences of double couple nodal planes' as well as P and T axis orientations on waveform similarities although the focal mechanisms were characterized by very high non-double couple components. Finally analysis confirmed that human activity represented by mining is able to produce strong (M > 3) repeating mining tremors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The amount and distribution of precipitation plays a vital role in the management of water resources, agriculture and flood-risk preparedness. Unfortunately, Zambia like many other developing countries is a highly data-scarce country with few and unevenly distributed meteorological stations. The objective of this study was to run a comparative analysis of satellite-based rainfall products (SRPs) and gauge data to ascertain the reliability of using SRPs for daily rainfall measurements in Zambia. The four daily SRPs examined in this study include the following: The Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite and ground-based observations version 3 (TAMSATv3), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data version 2 (CHIRPSv2.0), and the African Rainfall Climatology Version 2 (ARCv2). SRPs were compared to rain gauge data from 35 meteorological, agrometeorological, and climatological stations in Zambia for the period 1998–2015. Statistical analyses were extensively carried out at temporal scales inter alia daily, monthly, seasonal and annual. Comparisons were also done for three stations lying at the highest, middle and lowest elevations to examine the ability of SRPs to capture precipitation occurrences on complex topography. Strong coefficient of determination (&gt; 0.9) of all the SRPs and gauge data were found at the monthly scale even over multifaceted topography. However, the ability of these products to capture rain gauge data at daily, seasonal and annual scales differs markedly. Specifically, PERSIANN outperforms all the other SRPs at all scales, CHIRPSv2.0 is rated second, followed by TAMSATv3 and ARCv2, respectively. These results suggest that PERSIANN can reliably be used in studies that seek to estimate rainfall in data-sparse regions of Zambia at any temporal scale and arrive at similar results to rain gauge data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Settling of solid particles in a stratified ambient fluid is a process widely encountered in geophysical flows. A set of experiments demonstrating the settling behaviour (the pattern of trajectory, variation of particle orientation, and settling velocity with depth) of thin disks descending through a nonlinear density transition was performed. The results showed complex hydrodynamic interactions between a particle and a liquid causing settling orientation instabilities and unsteady particle descent in low to moderate Reynolds number regime. Five phases of settling were observed: two phases with stable horizontal, one with stable vertical disk position, and two reorientation phases; moreover, two local minima of settling velocity were identified. It was demonstrated that thresholds for local minima and the first reorientation depend on the settling dynamics in an upper layer, stratification conditions, and disk geometry. The comparison of settling behaviour of thin disks varying in diameter revealed that settling dynamics is sensitive to particle geometry mainly in the upper part of density transition with a non-obvious result that the first minimum velocity is smaller for a disk with a larger diameter than for a disk with a smaller diameter. The analysis of settling trajectory showed that two reorientations are accompanied with a horizontal drift, which may be important in the context of interactions between particles settling in a group.",

Due to low seismicity of Poland, the project was focused on events of magnitude range 1–3 in selected regions in order to maximize the chance of recording any natural event. The project used mobile seismic stations and was divided into two stages. Five-year measurements brought over one hundred natural seismic events of magnitudes ML range 0.5–3.8. Most of them were located in the Podhale region in the Carpathians. Together with previously recorded events this made it possible to conduct a preliminary study on ground motion prediction equation for this region. Only one natural event, of magnitude ML = 3.8, was recorded outside the Carpathians in a surprising location in central-west Poland.",

Taking the Eyjafjallajokull volcanic ash clouds formed on 15 and 19 April 2010 as an example, in this paper, the PCA method is used to monitor the volcanic ash cloud based on MODIS bands selection; the USGS standard spectral database and the volcanic absorbing aerosol index (AAI) are applied as contrasts to the monitoring result.

The rise in temperature up to 400 °C affected the physical precursors at the intermediate and final stages of the failure. Significant variations were detected in the acoustic and electromagnetic emissions. The coalescence criterion was slightly depending on the rock moisture and temperature effect.

The conventional staggered-grid finite-difference (SFD) operators are usually based on the Taylor-series expansion theory. If they are used to solve wave equation on a larger frequency content, a strong dispersion will occur, which directly affects the seismic image quality. In this paper, we propose an optimal SFD operator based on least squares to solve acoustic wave equation for prestack RTM, and obtain a new antidispersion RTM algorithm that can use short spatial difference operators. The synthetic and real data tests demonstrate that the least squares SFD (LSSFD) operator can mitigate the numerical dispersion, and the acoustic RTM using the LSSFD operator can effectively improve image quality comparing with that using the Taylor-series expansion SFD (TESFD) operator. Moreover, the LSSFD method can adopt a shorter spatial difference operator to reduce the computing cost.",

Polarization angle obtained by performing rotation on radial and transverse components of VSP data was used to determine the direction of polarization of fast shear wave which corresponds to direction of fractures. It was shown that correct implementation of shear wave splitting analysis can be used for determination of fracture direction. During frequencydependent anisotropy analysis, it was found that the time delays in shearwaves decrease as the frequency increases.

This method is based on decomposing the observed seismic signals by exponentially damped cosines at short-time intervals. As a result, a discrete Prony spectrum including values of four parameters (amplitude, damping factor, frequency, phase) can be created. This decomposition occurs at many short-time intervals moving along an observed trace. The combined Prony spectrum of the trace can be used to create images of the trace through a selection of some values of the parameters. These images created for all traces of a seismic section provide an opportunity for locating zones of frequency-dependent anomalous scattering and absorption of seismic energy. Subsequently, the zones can be correlated with target seismic horizons. Analysis and interpretation of these zones may promote understanding of the target horizons features and help to connect these features with the presence of possible reservoirs.",

Seismic tomography is one of the methods that require good knowledge of seismic velocities in sediments and unfortunately by itself cannot provide detailed information about distribution of seismic velocities in sedimentary cover. This paper presents results of P-wave velocity analysis in the old Paleozoic sediments in area of Polish Lowland, Folded Area, and all sediments in complicated area of the Carpathian Mountains in Poland. Due to location on conjunction of three major tectonic units — the Precambrian East European Craton, the Paleozoic Platform of Central and Western Europe, and the Alpine orogen represented by the Carpathian Mountains the maximum depth of these sediments reaches up to 25 000 m in the Carpathian Mountains. Seismic velocities based on 492 deep boreholes with vertical seismic profiling and a total of 741 vertical seismic profiles taken from 29 seismic refraction profiles are analyzed separately for 14 geologically different units. For each unit, velocity versus depth relations are approximated by second or third order polynomials.",

The survey data was treated in three different approaches including direct VES inversion, pseudo-2D method and horizontal profiling, in order to maximize the reliability of the data interpretation. The results revealed the presence of a local faulted anticline structure at the top of the Paleogene formation, underneath the basaltic outcrops where Deir El-Adas village is situated. The appearance of this subsurface anticline structure has complicated the local hydro-geological situation, and most likely led to limitation of the groundwater recharge in the area. Moreover, the performed piezometric and discharge maps indicated the presence of a notable groundwater watershed, in addition to feeble water productivity of the wells drilled adjacent to Deir El-Adas, mostly related to the subsurface geological and tectonic settings in the area.",

    "abstract": "We describe an algorithm for rapidly computing the surface displacements induced by a general polygonal load on a layered, isotropic, elastic half-space. The arbitrary surface pressure field is discretized using a large number, n, of equally-sized circular loading elements. The problem is to compute the displacement at a large number, m, of points (or stations) distributed over the surface. The essence of our technique is to reorganize all but a computationally insignificant part of this calculation into an equivalent problem: compute the displacements due to a single circular loading element at a total of m n stations (where m n is the product m × n). We solve this \"parallel\" problem at high computational speed by utilizing the sparse evaluation and massive interpolation (SEMI) method. Because the product m n that arises in our parallel problem is normally very large, we take maximum possible advantage of the acceleration achieved by the SEMI algorithm.",

For analysis, two spectral decomposition algorithms were tested on 3D seismic data: the first, based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and second, on Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD). Additionally the results of instantaneous frequency (IF) were compared with the results of peak frequency (PF) computed after the CEEMD. Both algorithms of SD enabled us to interpret channels, but the results are marginally different, i.e. the FFT shows more coarse, linear structures, that are desirable for channel interpretation, whereas the CEEMD does not highlight these structures as clearly and shows more, what the authors believe to be, noise.",

    "abstract": "The mid-latitude ionospheric trough is a depleted region of ionospheric plasma observed in the topside ionosphere. Its behavior can provide useful information about the magnetospheric dynamics, since its existence is sensitive to magnetospherically induced motions. Midlatitude trough is mainly a night-time phenomenon. Both, its general features and detailed characteristics strongly depend on the level of geomagnetic disturbances, time of the day, season, and the solar cycle, among others. Although many studies provide basic information about general characteristics of the main ionospheric trough structure, an accurate prediction of the trough behavior in specific events is still understood poorly. The paper presents the mid-latitude trough characteristics with regard to the geomagnetic longitude and season during a solar activity minimum, as based on the DEMETER in situ satellite measurements and the data retrieved from FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC radio occultation measurements.",

    "abstract": "The fractured granite basement is the primary oil and gas reservoir in the Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam. Due to the complexity of this nonlayered unconventional target, combined with complicated fault and fracture systems, the seismic data quality near and within the basement section is very low. For this reason, it is important to apply improved seismic data processing workflows, filtering and migration techniques, as wells as attribute processing methods to enhance the imaging quality. Our studies show that applying different types of filters, including the f-k, Radon transform and Tau-P, improves signal to noise ratio, removing multiples, revealing basement’s top and its related fractured and fault zones. In addition, the application of multi-arrival-solution migration algorithms, such as Kirchhoff Migration and Controlled Beam Migration, provides improved imaging for identifying basement top and faults and fractures within the basement. Furthermore, the application of seismic attributes such as curvature, apparent dip, or energy gradient, is important in locating faults and fractures, whereas mapping of intensity and orientation of such structures assists the delineation of “sweet spots” and assists the planning of exploration.",

Despite conventional well logs (CWLs), NMR logging is very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, idea of synthesizing NMR log from CWLs would be of a great appeal among reservoir engineers. For this purpose, three optimization strategies are followed. Firstly, artificial neural network (ANN) is optimized by virtue of hybrid genetic algorithm-pattern search (GA-PS) technique, then fuzzy logic (FL) is optimized by means of GA-PS, and eventually an alternative condition expectation (ACE) model is constructed using the concept of committee machine to combine outputs of optimized and non-optimized FL and ANN models. Results indicated that optimization of traditional ANN and FL model using GA-PS technique significantly enhances their performances. Furthermore, the ACE committee of aforementioned models produces more accurate and reliable results compared with a singular model performing alone.",

Halny winds occur most frequently in the cold period of the year (Oct–Feb), with the frequency peaking in November, and sporadically in the summer. The occurrence of foehn winds is strongly dependent on the synoptic situation. Therefore, the main aim of the study was to identify the circulation conditions conducive to their occurrence on the Polish side of the Tatra Mountains. Circulation conditions responsible for foehn formation were analysed using gridded sea level pressure (SLP) data from the NCEP-DOE (National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy) reanalyses. The occurrence of foehn wind in the Tatra Mountains is associated with a low pressure system over north-western Europe, and above normal pressure over south-eastern Europe. The location and intensity of the centres of atmospheric influence on foehn days can vary, as indicated by the three types of pressure systems favouring the occurrence of the phenomenon, distinguished by the hierarchical grouping method. In type 1, the cyclonic centre spreads over northern Europe, in type 2 over western Europe and in type 3 over north-western Europe. In types 1 and 3, the air masses come from the south-west, and in type 2 more from the south. Type 3 is characterised by the greatest horizontal pressure gradients among the three circulation types and with the greatest SLP anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We studied seismic features of the 2023 Kahramanmaraş Türkiye earthquake sequence by analyzing the spatiotemporal behavior of the b - and - p values and source characteristics of the mainshocks. We complemented our study by determining the regional stress field. The b -values in the region varied from 0.45 to 1.15. We observed a slight b -value decrease (Δ b ≈0.2) months before the two mainshocks. Our results exhibited complex b -value patterns on the fault planes and regular aftershock productivity rates (1.14 &lt; p &lt; 1.25). We compare static stress drop estimates derived from effective fault dimensions to those of finite-fault dimensions. Total effective stress drops (the sum of the stress drops of all fault segments) for the earthquake doublet were almost identical (~ 2.05 MPa), while those from finite-fault dimensions are somewhat lower (0.35 and 0.96 MPa). Based on a complete stress drop case, effective seismic efficiency was 0.65 and 0.43 for both mainshocks. The amount of partial stress drop was used to discriminate between different stress drop models. No clear model is discerned for the first mainshock, but a partial or even complete stress drop, assuming finite-fault dimensions, is supported by our measurements. Stress drop estimations derived from spectral analysis (25.46 and 34.39 MPa) agreed with global studies but larger than finite and effective fault estimates. Stress inversion results indicated that in the fault segments where the mainshocks occurred, the orientation of principal axes was consistent with a strike-slip regime. Conversely, the normal-faulting regime dominates adjacent areas of the main fault system.",

    "abstract": "The analytical study of the reflection and transmission coefficient of the seafloor interface is essential for the characterization of the ocean bottom in marine seismic exploration. Based on the boundary conditions of the seafloor interface, the analytical expression of the reflection and transmission coefficient at the submarine interface is derived in this study by using the steady-state wave solution of the elastic wave in a homogeneous, isotropic medium. With this analytical expression, the characteristics of the reflection and transmission coefficient at the submarine interface are analysed and discussed using critical angles. The results show that the change in the reflection and transmission coefficient with the incidence angle presents a \"segmented\" characteristic, in which the critical angle is the dividing point. The amplitude value and phase angle of the coefficient at the submarine interface change dramatically at the critical angle, which is related to the P- and S-wave velocities in the seabed layer. Compared with the stiff seabed, the soft seabed has a larger P-wave critical angle and an absence of the converted S-wave critical angle, owing to the low P- and S-wave velocities in the solid seabed layer. By analysing and discussing the special changes that occur in the coefficient values at the critical angle, the reflection and transmission characteristics of the different incident angles are obtained. Synthetic models of both stiff and soft seafloors are provided in this study to verify the analytical results. Finally, we compared our synthetic results with real data from the Gulf of Mexico, which enabled the validation of our conclusions.",

The circular measures of location and dispersion were used in the long-term samples of dates of maxima. The mixture of von Mises distributions was assumed as the theoretical distribution function of the date of winter, summer and annual maximum flow. The number of components was selected on the basis of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion and the parameters were estimated by means of the Maximum Likelihood method. The goodness of fit was assessed using both the correlation between quantiles and a version of the Kuiper's and Watson's test. Results show that the number of components varied between catchments and it was different for seasonal and annual maxima. Differences between catchments in circular characteristics were explained using climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature. Further studies may include circular grouping catchments based on similarity between distribution functions and the linkage between dates of maximum precipitation and maximum flow.",

    "abstract": "In radioastronomy the interferometric measurement between radiotelescopes located relatively close to each other helps removing ionospheric effects. Unfortunately, in case of networks such as LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), due to long baselines (currently up to 1500 km), interferometric methods fail to provide sufficiently accurate ionosphere delay corrections. Practically it means that systems such as LOFAR need external ionosphere information, coming from Global or Regional Ionospheric Maps (GIMs or RIMs, respectively). Thanks to the technology based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the scientific community is provided with ionosphere sounding virtually worldwide. In this paper we compare several interpolation methods for RIMs computation based on scattered Vertical Total Electron Content measurements located on one thin ionospheric layer (Ionospheric Pierce Points—IPPs). The results of this work show that methods that take into account the topology of the data distribution (e.g., natural neighbour interpolation) perform better than those based on geometric computation only (e.g., distance-weighted methods).",

    "abstract": "There is an exceptional opportunity of achieving simultaneous and complementary data from a multitude of geoscience and environmental near-earth orbiting artificial satellites to study phenomena related to the climate change. These satellite missions provide the information about the various phenomena, such as sea level change, ice melting, soil moisture variation, temperature changes and earth surface deformations. In this study, we focus on permafrost thawing and its associated gravity change (in terms of the groundwater storage), and organic material changes using the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) data and other satellite- and ground-based observations. The estimation of permafrost changes requires combining information from various sources, particularly using the gravity field change, surface temperature change, and glacial isostatic adjustment. The most significant factor for a careful monitoring of the permafrost thawing is the fact that this process could be responsible for releasing an additional enormous amount of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere, most importantly to mention carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane that are currently stored in the frozen ground. The results of a preliminary numerical analysis reveal a possible existence of a high correlation between the secular trends of greenhouse gases (CO2), temperature and equivalent water thickness (in permafrost active layer) in the selected regions. Furthermore, according to our estimates based on processing the GRACE data, the groundwater storage attributed due to permafrost thawing increased at the annual rates of 3.4, 3.8, 4.4 and 4.0 cm, respectively, in Siberia, North Alaska and Canada (Yukon and Hudson Bay). Despite a rather preliminary character of our results, these findings indicate that the methodology developed and applied in this study should be further improved by incorporating the in situ permafrost measurements.",

    "abstract": "Twin structural traps that lie within the Miocene strata of the Carpathian Foredeep that are localized above Cierpisz and Mrowla-Bratkowice highs exhibit identical bright-spot seismic anomalies, but only those associated with the Cierpisz high are profitable gas reservoirs. Bright spots can be a result of weak gas or water saturation, but also seismic interference known as tuning effect. For these reasons, it is crucial to differentiate between seismic anomalies. In this article, we present the possibilities of verification of seismic anomalies that occur within the siliciclastic Miocene sediments of the Carpathian Foredeep with the application of AVO analysis and spectral decomposition. AVO methodology enabled to limit the number of anomalies that are present in the post-stack seismic data. These anomalies, however, may also be a result of tuning which is common for the heterolithic sequences in the Miocene sediments of the Carpathian Foredeep. For classification of anomalies in the view of the above, spectral decomposition based on the Basis Pursuit algorithm was applied. Spectral decomposition enabled to divide AVO anomalies in those that are the result of gas saturation and the tuning effect. Gas-saturated zones are characterized by higher spectral amplitudes of the lower frequency range, whereas tuning effect yields higher spectral amplitudes for the higher frequency content. This relation is visible for the data set and enables qualitative differentiation for the set of seismic anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Presented study gives an insight into general proportions of the actual geomorphology, subglacial morphology and thickness of the drift (quaternary sediments) particularly well-pronounced glacial morphology in the Tatras and, on the other hand, the general scarcity of the data in this field. Objectives of the geophysical survey in this study were imaging of the morphology of bedrock surface under the drift (glacial and postglacial) sediments and determination of thickness of the drift and its composition. Two methods were applied: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and seismic refraction profiling. GPR was used to examine drift sediments due to its high resolution and low depth of penetration. Seismic method with lower resolution but higher penetration depth gave an image of boundary between bedrock and drift. In addition, the results of seismic tomography allowed the velocity field imaging which shows changes inside the postglacial deposits. The results of the two methods used in this research suggest that points of depression exist in the subglacial morphology with a depth of about c.a. 40 below the present-day terrain surface and c.a. 25 m below surrounding subglacial surface. This trough has also been estimated to be about 150 m wide. Its considerable depth and steep slopes show that its origin can be related to erosion of subglacial water during the decay of the last (Würm) glaciation of the Sucha Woda and Panszczyca valleys.",

    "abstract": "Permeability is a property of rocks which refers to the ability of fluids to flow through each substance. It depends on several factors as pore shape and diameter. Also the presence and type of clay has a large influence on the permeability value. Permeability can be measured on rock sample in the laboratory by injecting fluid through the rock under known condition, but this provides only point information. Due to the dependence of the parameter on many factors, the deterministic estimation of permeability based on laboratory measurement and well logs is problematic. Many empirical methods for determining permeability are available in the literature and interpretation systems. An interesting approach to the problem is the use of artificial neural networks based on laboratory measurement and modern, high-resolution logging tools. The authors decided to use MLP artificial neural networks, which allow permeability estimation and can be used both in the test well and applied to neighbouring wells. The network was checked in several variants. Obtained results show the legitimacy of using artificial neural networks in the issue of estimating permeability. However, they also show limitations resulting from the lack of accurate data or influence of geological setting and processes.",

The aim of the surveys was the noninvasive detection of karst forms as well as weathered and fractured bedrock which may threaten the stability of the surface and, consequently, may cause damage to buildings, as well as overground and underground infrastructure. The geophysical surveys were conducted at a depth of only a few meters, i.e., to the depth of buildings foundations. GPR surveys were carried out in short-offset reflection profiling mode with standard orientation of the antennae set; however, on one site, different orientations of antennae were tested. During ERT surveys, different measurement arrays were applied in order to analyze which array was optimal for the detection of karst forms as well as weathered and fractured bedrock. Complex interpretation of geophysical surveys resulted in reduced ambiguity and revealed some regions, dangerous for surface stability. Due to the fact that gypsum deposits were investigated to the depth of maximum 10 m; therefore, hydrological processes were analyzed in the paper instead of hydrogeological processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spatial and depth variability of soil characteristics greatly influence its optimum utilization and management. Concealing nature of soil subsurface horizons has made the traditional soil investigations which rely on point information less reliable. In this study, an alternative use of ground penetrating radar (GPR)—a near-surface geophysical survey method—was tested to address the shortcomings. The focus of the study was on assessment of characteristics variability of soil layers at a test site and evaluation of effects of compaction caused by machinery traffics on soil. GPR methods utilize electromagnetic energy in the frequency range of 10 MHz and 3.0 GHz. Fourteen profiles GPR data were acquired at the test site-a farmland in Krakow, Poland. Compaction on parts of the soil was induced using tractor movements (simulating traffic effects) at different passes. Data were processed using basic filtering algorithms and attributes computations executed in Reflexw software. Attempt made in the study was on use of GPR geophysical technique for soil assessment. The method allows delineation of the soil horizons which depicts characteristic depth changes and spatial variability within the horizons. Moreover, traffic effects that caused compaction on parts of the soil horizons were discernable from the GPR profile sections. Thus, similar densification like hardpan that may develop in natural setting can be investigated using the method. The results have shown the suitability of the method for quick, noninvasive and continuous soil investigation that may also allow assessment of temporal soil changes via repeated measurement.",

The approach is mainly dedicated to the cases in which the commonly used IDF-relationships do not provide satisfactory fit between simulations and observations, and more complex formulas with higher number of parameters are advisable. Precipitation data from Gdańsk gauge station were analyzed as the example, with use of peak-overthreshold method and Chomicz scale for rainfall intensity. General forms of the IDF-function were chosen and the parameter calibration with use of CRS algorithm was developed. The compliance of the obtained IDFformulas with precipitation data and the efficiency of the algorithm were analyzed. The study confirmed the proposed empirical approach may be an interesting alternative for probabilistic ones, especially when IDFrelationship has more complex form and precipitation data do not match \"typical\" hydrological distributions.",

A stack of vertical prisms having equal widths, whose depths become the unknown parameters to be estimated, describes the geometry of a sedimentary basin above the basement complex. Because no closed form analytical equation can be derivable in the space domain using the exponential density-depth function, a combination of analytical and numerical approaches is used to realize forward gravity modeling. The depth estimates of sediment-basement interface are initiated and subsequently improved iteratively by minimizing the objective function between the observed and modeled gravity anomalies within the specified convergence criteria. Two gravity anomaly profiles, one synthetic and a real, are interpreted using the proposed technique to demonstrate its applicability.",

The solution can account for finite width and finite level of water in the ditches, finite penetration of the drains in the soil, and also a variable ponding field at the surface of the soil. The study highlights the fact that the transient state duration of a partially penetrating ponded drainage scenario may be considerable should the drains be dug in a lowly conductive soil with a high storage coefficient, particularly if the underlying impervious layer lies at a large distance from the bottom of the ditches and the separation between the adjacent ditches is also large at the same time.",

The spherical Slepian basis is a set of bandlimited functions which have the majority of their energy concentrated by optimization inside an arbitrarily defined region, yet remain orthogonal within the spatial region of interest. Hence, they are suitable for decomposing the spherical harmonic models into the portions that have significant strength only in the selected areas. In this study, the converted spherical harmonics to the Slepian bases were updated by the terrestrial GPS observations by use of the least-squares estimation with weighted parameters for local ionospheric modeling.

In Coulomb’s charges method, Laplace’s equation is solved for the electric field distribution in rock medium with internal boundaries between different resistivity layers. There, the boundary problem is reduced to Fred-holm integral equation of the second kind. The second method uses a finite element array to model apparent resistivity from laterolog. The task is treated as DC problem and the Laplace equation is solved numerically. The presented methods were applied to borehole data covering a typical stratigraphie section of the Fore-Sudetic Monocline in southwestern Poland. Apparent resistivity was calculated using the Coulomb’s charges method and alternatively modeled using a finite element method which gave similar results. Then, a series of linear corrections for borehole, shoulder bed, and filtration effects for apparent resistivity obtained by the Coulomb’s charges method demonstrated the feasibility of calculating true resistivity of virgin and invaded zones. The proposed methods provide a flexible solution in modeling which can be adapted to other logs.",

Moreover, existing TDIP instruments generally output only the apparent chargeability, without providing complete secondary field information. To increase the robustness of TDIP method against interference and obtain more detailed secondary field information, an improved data-processing algorithm is proposed here. This method includes an efficient digital notch filter which can effectively eliminate all the main components of the power line interference. Hardware model of this filter was constructed and Vhsic Hardware Description Language code for it was generated using Digital Signal Processor Builder. In addition, a time-location method was proposed to extract secondary field information in case of unexpected data loss or failure of the synchronous technologies. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the method and the notch filter were verified by using the Cole-Cole model implemented by Simulink software. Moreover, indoor and field tests confirmed the application effect of the algorithm in the fieldwork.",

    "abstract": "This paper is focused on Saharan dust transport to Central Europe/Poland; we compare properties of atmospheric Saharan dust using data from NAAPS, MACC, AERONET as well as observations obtained during HyMountEcos campaign in June 2012. Ten years of dust climatology shows that long-range transport of Saharan dust to Central Europe is mostly during spring and summer. HYSPLIT back-trajectories indicate airmass transport mainly in November, but it does not agree with modeled maxima of dust optical depth. NAAPS model shows maximum of dust optical depth (~0.04–0.05, 550 nm) in April–May, but the MACC modeled peak is broader (~0.04). During occurrence of mineral dust over Central-Europe for 14% (NAAPS) / 12% (MACC) of days dust optical depths are above 0.05 and during 4% (NAAPS) / 2.5% (MACC) of days dust optical depths exceed 0.1. The HyMountEcos campaign took place in June–July 2012 in the mountainous region of Karkonosze. The analysis includes remote sensing data from lidars, sunphotometers, and numerical simulations from NAAPS, MACC, DREAM8b models. Comparison of simulations with observations demonstrates the ability of models to reasonably reproduce aerosol vertical distributions and their temporal variability. However, significant differences between simulated and measured AODs were found. The best agreement was achieved for MACC model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On 2 December 2020 10:54 UTC a shallow earthquake of M W (NOA) = 4.6 occurred near the village of Kallithea (to the east of Thiva), central Greece, which, despite its modest size, was locally damaging. Using InSAR and GNSS data, we mapped a permanent change on the ground surface, i.e., a subsidence of 7 cm. Our geodetic inversion modelling indicates that the rupture occurred on a WNW–ESE striking, SSW-dipping normal fault, with a dip-angle of ~ 54°. The maximum slip value was 0.35 m, which was reached at a depth of about 1100 m. The analysis of broadband seismological data also provided kinematic source parameters such as moment magnitude M W = 4.6 (± 0.1), rupture area 6.3 km 2 and mean slip 0.16 m, which agree with the values obtained from the geodetic model. The effects of the earthquake were disproportionate to its moderate magnitude, probably due to its unusually shallow depth (slip centroid at 1.1 km) and the high efficiency of the earthquake (radiation efficiency $$\\eta$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>η</mml:mi> </mml:math> = 0.62). The geodetic data inversion also indicates that within the uncertainty limits of the technique, three scenarios are possible (a) the earthquake responsible for the mapped surface deformation may have occurred on a ~ 2-km long, blind normal fault different from the well-known active Kallithea normal fault or (b) could have occurred along a secondary fault that branches off the Kallithea fault or (c) it may have occurred along the Kallithea fault itself, but with its geometrical configuration could not be modelled with available data. We have also concluded that with a high dip-angle Kallithea Fault forward model it is not possible to fit the geodetic data. The rupture initiated at a very shallow depth (1.1 km) and it could not propagate deeper possibly because of a structural barrier down-dip. The 2020 event near Kallithea highlighted the structural complexity in this region of the Asopos Rift valley as the reactivation of the WNW–ESE structures indicates their significant role in strain accommodation and that they still represent a seismic hazard for this region.",

    "abstract": "Rivers of the Polish Carpathians incised deeply during the twentieth century, but detailed information about the timing and amount of incision of their channels exists only for water-gauge cross sections. Applicability of photogrammetric extraction of digital elevation models (DEMs) from archival aerial photos for reconstructing changes in vertical river position was verified in the study of a 3-km reach of the Czarny Dunajec River. DEMs extracted from a few sets of archival aerial photos from the years 1964–1994 together with recent orthophotos and DEMs were used in the analysis. Measurements taken in river cross sections spaced at 100-m intervals indicated that on average the lowest point of the channel bed lowered between 1964 and 2009 by 1.74 ± 0.17 m, low-flow water surface by 1.57 ± 0.07 m, active river channel by 1.54 ± 0.12 m and the belt of river migration by 1.03 ± 0.15 m. However, the change in vertical river position during the years 1964–2009 varied greatly along the reach, with the elevation of low-flow water surface lowered by up to 3.61 ± 0.07 m in the upper part of the reach and increased by up to 1.34 ± 0.07 m in its lower part. Combining the information about changes in vertical river position and the width of river migration belt yielded data about the change in sediment volume in the reach, with an average annual loss of sediment amounting to 256 ± 37 m3 per 100-m channel segment. The study indicated that DEMs generated from archival aerial photos can be a useful tool in analysing recent vertical channel changes outside water-gauge stations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main goal of the work is to create an automatic method of locating weak zones within flood embankments structure based on ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements. The presented research shows the possibilities of using advanced methods of GPR signal processing and its analysis with the help of signal attributes for detecting zones threatening the stability of the structure of flood embankments. Obtained results may help in quick detection of potential weak zones of the embankments and consequently give means to ameliorate them, which may prevent damage to the embankments during rise in the level of river water. The presented analyses were carried out on GPR data obtained for the flood banks of the Rudawa River (Kraków, Poland) in the area of their visible degradation. The use of signal attributes, such as Energy, instantaneous frequency, similarity, curvature gradient, dominant frequency, allowed initial indication of anomalous zones threatening the stability of embankment. Advanced processing supported by the use of advanced filters such as GLCM, Grubbs filter threshold and Convolve Prewitt helped in the analysis of the structure of the embankments. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the supervised and unsupervised variants were used to perform the automatic classification of weakened zones within the embankments. The results demonstrated the usefulness of GPR geophysical method through integration of ANN in the analysis of the data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The dynamic nature of rock mass damage during mining activity generates seismic events. This article shows, how the time window for the database influences on the actual status of seismic hazard for the longwall mining area in one of Polish coal mines using Gutenberg–Richter law. A time window of 10–90 days was assumed with similar or shorter prediction times forecast on its basis. Additionally, for each seismic database the hazard prediction accuracy was determined. The analysis shows that the 10- and 20-day base periods are too short for prediction purposes. The higher-energy seismic events sometimes do not occur within such a short period of time, preventing regression analysis and parameter b determination. The best time window for the seismic hazard prognosis in given geological and mining conditions seems to be 30–50 days. The shorter periods cause the underestimation of the seismic hazard prognosis. Low range of tremor energies and the relatively low number of seismic events with high energy cause the low probability of prediction of the seismic mining events (10–40%) of the energy of min. 10 6 J, even for longer day base periods. The accuracy of hazard prediction, obtained from each seismic database period, was determined, using the developed coefficient of hazard autoregression C N . The analysis of the Gutenberg–Richter distribution should serve as complementary tool of seismic hazard prediction only.",

Using the results of ITD decomposition of observed data, information of instantaneous amplitude and frequency can be determined. The improved ratio function of short-time average over long-time average and the information of instantaneous frequency are applied to the time-frequency-energy denoised signal for picking the P-arrival of the microseismic signal. We compared the proposed method with the wavelet transform method based on the denoised signal resulting from the best basis wavelet packet transform and the single-scale reconstruction of the wavelet transform. The comparison results showed that the new method is more effective and reliable for identifying P-arrivals of microseismic signals.",

It was derived that the most accurate model over Croatia was the one when only Croatian data were used, and by using the Adjusted Spherical Harmonic Analysis. Based on Croatian repeat stations’ data in the interval 2007.5–2010.5, and a global Enhanced Magnetic Model, it was possible to estimate the crustal field at those sites. It was also done by taking into account the empirical adjustment for long-term external field variations. The higher crustal field values were found at those stations which are on or close to the Adriatic anomaly.",

Statistics of interevent distances and interevent times between successive aftershocks recorded for the whole month of October 2013 show marked differences from those of historical earthquakes from two Philippine catalogues of varying periods and completeness levels. In particular, the distributions closely follow only the regimes of the historical distributions that were previously attributed to the strong spatio-temporal correlations. The results therefore suggest that these correlated regimes which emerged naturally from the analyses are strongly dominated by the clustering of aftershock events.",

FEST-EWB is a hydrological model that predicts soil moisture and the surface energy fluxes on a continuous basis. LST is then a modelled variable. Ground and remote sensing data from the Regional Experiments For Land-atmosphere Exchanges (REFLEX) campaign in 2012 in Barrax gave the opportunity to validate and compare spatially distributed energy fluxes. The output of both models matches the ground observations quite well. However, a spatial analysis reveals significant differences between the two approaches for latent and sensible heat fluxes over relatively small fields characterized by high heterogeneity in vegetation cover.",

Also presented are the technical aspects and data processing techniques of this remotely operated observatory. Analysis of data quality and comparison with data from the surrounding INTERMAGNET observatories is discussed in detail. Although remote observatories cannot provide the ideal environment for magnetometers, the obtained results accentuate the potential of the new observatory to provide high-quality data.

The analysis covered the 8-hour running average and daily maximum of near surface ozone concentrations. Also, the accumulated exposure when ozone concentrations were above 120 μg/m3 (AOT60) was calculated as a diagnostic indicator of adverse health effects for each year. Although high ozone concentrations are associated with hot temperatures, the exposure to values higher than 120 μg /m3 is correlated with the length of the hot weather period rather than with the occurrence of days with extremely high temperatures. In most cases the elevated ozone concentrations occurred during days when the maximum temperature was higher than 24°C. Episodes of very high ozone concentrations, exceeding 180 μg /m3, were not associated with heat wave periods at analysed locations.",

Efficient quantification of active continental deformations demands the use of a multidisciplinary approach, including neotectonic, seismotectonic and geodetic methods. The present-day tectonic mobility in the Pannonian Basin is predominantly controlled by the northward movement of the Adria micro-plate, which has produced compressional stresses that were party accommodated by the Alps-Dinarides thrust belt and partly transferred towards its hinterland. Influence of thus induced stresses on the recent strain field, deformations and tectonic mobility in the southern segment of the Pannonian Basin has been investigated using GPS measurements of the horizontal mobility in the Vojvodina area (northern Serbia).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Vrancea seismic zone, located in the bend region of the South-Eastern Carpathians, is a unique area with both crustal and intermediate-depth seismic activity and is known as one of the most active seismic area in Europe. Moderate crustal seismicity is recorded all over the Carpathian region, but the far more intense activity occurs in a small subcrustal seismogenic volume beneath the SE‐bend of the Carpathian arc with about 20 × 50 km lateral and 110 km vertical extent (70–180 km depth). A unique slab geometry, likely preserved until the present, causes stress localization due to the slab bending and subsequent stress release resulting in large mantle earthquakes in the region. The main focus of this study is to determine the focal mechanisms for events with a magnitude larger than 2.7, between 2005 and 2020 and evaluate the current stress field along the Vrancea subcrustal region, from the derived fault plane solutions. The main style of faulting for Vrancea subcrustal events presents a predominant reverse one, with two main earthquakes categories: the first one with the nodal planes, oriented NE–SW parallel with the Carpathian Arc and the second one with the nodal planes, oriented NW–SE perpendicular on the Carpathian Arc. The results of stress inversion indicate a dominant thrust faulting style, with an average stress regime index of 2.87. The stress pattern shows similar partitioning with vertical extension in the slab and no preferred orientation in the overlying crust, showing a transition regime from the extensional regime in the Moesian Platform to the compressional regime in the Vrancea subcrustal zone.",

    "abstract": "Gravity (microgravity) research is more frequently carried out in urban areas, in close proximity to various types of buildings. It is necessary to take into account the gravity impact of these buildings on the measurements by calculating and factoring in the appropriate correction. The easiest method to calculate the corrections is to base them on simplified models of the buildings, approximated mostly by a rectangular prism. This paper presents an analysis of correction based on simplified models of six different buildings. It has been clearly demonstrated that density of a simplified model of a building or an element of the building is different from the average density, especially for gravity measurements inside the buildings. The research demonstrates that it is better to approximate the building with two or three rectangular prisms than with only one treated as a whole. However, the difficulty lies in determining the density of the lowest storey, the value of which diverges from the average density the most. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that in calculating building corrections simplified models of the buildings can be used, even for observation stations that are located in a close proximity to the buildings, as long as the conditions described in this article are met.",

In the result of the rainfall and static pressure of the blocks, the water with SO42− increases up to the groundwater level, become the great threat for the flat blocks. The water creates specific hydrogeological conditions occurring in the zone of the building’s foundations. To eliminate the mentioned threat, we should determine precisely the thickness of the soil and impermeable clay as well as the depth of the gypsum basement.

The Ward’s hierarchical cluster analysis was used for grouping sub-catchments in reference to the standardized aforementioned flows. Trends analysis was performed for each cluster of catchments in all combinations of periods not shorter than 20 years. Spatial distribution of clusters of catchments has been analysed according to geographical locations. There are observed different trends in distinguished groups of catchments, wherein the substantial differences concern long-term trends. Changes in trend direction in the years 1951–2015 were revealed, which indicate flow fluctuations. Presumably, physiographical heterogeneity of the Upper Vistula Basin is reflected in no unequivocal trends occurring in clusters of catchments. Some similarities were stated in short-term trends occurring in particular groups of catchments.",

The TAKR and the KR operators are analytically and numerically compared in order to verify their impacts on the data at a new level. Analyses of amplitude and velocity sensitivity of the TAKR and KR were performed: one concerning the difference between the weight functions and the other related to the velocity variation. The comparisons between operators were performed using numerical examples. The feasibility of the KR and TAKR operators was demonstrated not only kinematically but also dynamically for their purposes. In other words, one preserves amplitude (KR), and the other corrects the amplitude (TAKR). In the end, we applied the operators to a GPR data set.",

Thus the model suggests an explanation of the universal pattern of rescaled Earthquake Recurrence Time Distributions in terms of combinatorial rules for accumulation and abrupt release of seismic energy.",

    "abstract": "The possibility of improving the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission satellite orbit using gravity gradient observations was investigated. The orbit improvement is performed by a dedicated software package, called the Orbital Computation System (OCS), which is based on the classical least squares method. The corrections to the initial satellite state vector components are estimated in an iterative process, using dynamic models describing gravitational perturbations. An important component implemented in the OCS package is the 8th order Cowell numerical integration procedure, which directly generates the satellite orbit. Taking into account the real and simulated GOCE gravity gradients, different variants of the solution of the orbit improvement process were obtained. The improved orbits were compared to the GOCE reference orbits (Precise Science Orbits for the GOCE satellite provided by the European Space Agency) using the root mean squares (RMS) of the differences between the satellite positions in these orbits. The comparison between the improved orbits and the reference orbits was performed with respect to the inertial reference frame (IRF) at J2000.0 epoch. The RMS values for the solutions based on the real gravity gradient measurements are at a level of hundreds of kilometers and more. This means that orbit improvement using the real gravity gradients is ineffective. However, all solutions using simulated gravity gradients have RMS values below the threshold determined by the RMS values for the computed orbits (without the improvement). The most promising results were achieved when short orbital arcs with lengths up to tens of minutes were improved. For these short arcs, the RMS values reach the level of centimeters, which is close to the accuracy of the Precise Science Orbit for the GOCE satellite. Additional research has provided requirements for efficient orbit improvement in terms of the accuracy and spectral content of the measured gravity gradients.",

Teleseismic wave trains of strong earthquakes give rise to several hydraulic effects in boreholes, namely permanent water level changes and water level oscillations, which closely mimic the seismograms (hydro-seismograms). Clear identical anomalies in the deep borehole water levels have been observed on a large part of the territory of Georgia during passing of the S and Love–Rayleigh teleseismic waves (including also multiple surface Rayleigh waves) of the 2011 Tohoku M9 earthquake. The analysis carried out in order to find dynamically triggered events (non-volcanic tremors) of the Tohoku earthquake by the accepted methodology has not revealed a clear tremor signature in the test area: the Caucasus and North Turkey. The possible mechanisms of some seismic signals of unknown origin observed during passage of teleseismic waves of Tohoku earthquake are discussed.",

At first quarterly observation and later also continual monitoring by distributed measurement network were used. The network includes a number of different sensors that have been installed in selected places of underground spaces. There have not been any manifestations documenting dangerous changes of stability during the period of monitoring (2001–2015). The results of accomplished measurements from all convergence profiles confirm the total stability of all underground spaces. However, a number of places have been documented as potentially unstable. Measured values of selected parameters are presented in the paper, namely, movements along fractures, changes of stress tensor and fluctuations in the level of mine water table.",

S-wave velocity with the average shear wave velocity over the topmost 30 m of soil is obtained by experimental method from the V P values measured for the soils. The downtown part of Baku city is characterized by low VS30 values (< 250 m/s), related to sand, water-saturated sand, gravel-pebble, and limestone with clay. High surface PGA of 240 gal for the M7.5 event and of about 190 gal for the M6.3 event, and hence a high ground motion amplification, is observed in the shoreline area, through downtown, in the north-west, and in the east parts of Baku city with soft clays, loamy sands, gravel, sediments.",

Five array sites were situated in the close proximity to borehole sites. Shear wave velocity profiles were modeled at these five array sites with the aid of two computational techniques, viz. spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) and H/V ellipticity. Out of these five array sites, velocity estimates could be reliably inferred at three locations. The shear wave velocities estimated by these methods are found to be quite consistent with each other. The computed V S values up to 30 m depth are in the range from 275 to 375 m/s in most of the sites, which implies prevalence of a low velocity zone at some pocket areas. The results were corroborated by evidence of site geology as well as geotechnical information.",

    "abstract": "Ionosphere undergoes permanently solar flares that quickly change its properties inducing sometime unwanted effects. These changes, or events, are known as Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances (SIDs) and the knowledge of their magnitude may be of great interest to anticipate probable damages. Currently, there does not exist any classification of these ionospheric changes based on their amplitude due to the wide variability of its responses. The only way to surmise their importance is to study them indirectly, throughout the classification of the X-ray flux intensity recorded by satellites. An attempt of classification based on their duration was proposed by the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) but it is not very accurate because SID's duration is measured directly from the raw signal of the Very Low Frequency (VLF) signal and/or the Low Frequency (LF) signal. The aim of this work is to investigate, through a set of simple mathematical techniques applied to VLF/LF signals recorded by ground based receivers, the best method to estimate SIDs durations and then propose a new classification based on these durations.",

The common basis of laboratory results, well logging and seismic data was a recognition of elastic and reservoir properties of rocks. The common basis of laboratory results, well logging and seismic data were elastic and reservoir properties of rocks. Seismic attributes calculated from acoustic full waveforms were a link between the considered data. Seismic attributes strongly depend on small changes observed in rock formation related to lithology variations, facies changes, structural events and petrophysical properties variability. The observed trends and relationships of high correlation coefficients in the analysed data proved the assumption made at the beginning of research that common physical basis is a platform for data scaling. Proper scaling enables expanding the relationships determined from laboratory and well logging of petrophysical parameters to a seismic scale.",

It has been used both for acoustic and elastic numerical modelling and for 2D and 3D propagation models. Although there are many studies concerning its application to point sources, little so far has been done to generalise the time reversal method to the study of sequences of seismic events. The need to describe such processes better motivates the analysis presented in this paper. The synthetic time reversal imaging experiments presented in this work were conducted for sources with the same origin time as well as for the sources with a slight delay in origin time. For efficient visualisation of the seismic wave propagation and interference, a new coefficient—peak average power ratio—was introduced. The paper also presents a comparison of visualisation based on the proposed coefficient against a commonly used visualisation based on a maximum value.",

In order to properly quantify the weathering effects, a forth-order-accurate staggered-grid viscoelastic time-domain finite-difference program has been used for the simulation of SH-wave responses. Simulated results revealed that the defocusing caused by valley is frequency-independent in contrast to the ridge-focusing. A decrease of average spectral amplification (ASA) with an increase of shape-ratio of the non-weathered triangular and elliptical valleys was obtained. Overall, the amplification and de-amplification pattern was larger in case of triangular valleys as compared to the elliptical valleys. It can be concluded that the dwelling within or near the topcorners of weathered valleys may suffer more damage as compared to their surroundings. A weathered triangular valley with large shape-ratio may cause unexpected damage very near its top-corners since both the ASA and DGM are largest.",

However, it is difficult to determine the organic reef's internal structure and gas reservoirs due to numerous adverse factors such as the low resolution of seismic data, depth of burial, strong anisotropy, irregular spatial distribution and complex internal structure. A case study of wavelet decomposition and reconstruction technology applied to elucidate the features of organic reef reservoirs in the Changxing formation from Yuanba gas field shows that the seismic record reconstructed by high frequency signal can adequately describe the internal properties of organic reef reservoirs. Furthermore, the root mean square amplitude ratio of both low and high frequency data obtained from the reconstructed seismic data clearly show spatial distribution of gas and water in reef reservoirs.",

In an effort to search for a precursory signature we analysed the land and ocean parameters prior to the earthquakes, namely SLHF (Land) and SST (Ocean). The GPS TEC data indicate an anomalous behaviour from 1–13 days prior to earthquakes. The main purpose of this study was to explore and demonstrate the possibility of any changes in TEC, SST, and SLHF before, during and after the earthquakes which occurred near or beneath an ocean. This study may lead to better understanding of response of land, ocean, and ionosphere parameters prior to seismic activities.",

In this study, the chemical composition of the particulate matter was studied by high temporal resolution instruments, including an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) and a seven-wavelength aethalo-meter. Air masses were transported from twenty to several hundred kilometres, arriving at the measurement station after approximately half a day of transport. The concentration-weighted trajectory analysis suggests that organic aerosol particles are mainly transported over the Baltic Sea and the continent (southeast of Belarus). Results show that a significant fraction of the vegetation burning organic aerosol is transformed into oxidised forms in less than a half-day. Biomass burning aerosol (BBOA) was quantified from the ACSM data using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, while its spatial distribution was evaluated using air mass clustering approach.",

The hourly time series were reduced to hourly monthly medians which in turn were used for fitting a single station foF2 monthly median model. Two functional approaches have been investigated: a statistical approach and a spectral approach. The solar flux F10.7 is used to model the dependence of foF2 on the solar activity and is incorporated into both models by a polynomial expression. The statistical model employs polynomial functions to fit the F-layer critical frequency while the spectral model is based on spectral decomposition of the measured data and offers a better physical interpretation of the fitting parameters. The daytime and nighttime foF2 values calculated by both approaches are compared during high and low solar activity. In general, the statistical model has a slightly lower uncertainty at the expense of the larger number of fitting parameters. However, the spectral approach is superior for modeling the periodic effects and performs better when comparing the results for high and low solar activity. Comparison with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI 2012) shows that both local models are better at describing the local values of the F-layer critical frequency.",

In seismically active regions without sufficiently strong ground motion data to build empirical models, hybrid models become vital. Georgia does not have sufficiently strong ground motion data to build empirical models. In this study, we have applied the host-totarget method in two regions in Georgia with different source mechanisms. According to the tectonic regime of the target areas, two different regions are chosen as host regions. One of them is in Turkey with the dominant strike-slip source mechanism, while the other is in Iran with the prevalence of reverse-mechanism events. We performed stochastic finite-fault simulations in both host and target areas and employed the hybrid-empirical method as introduced in Campbell (2003). An initial set of hybrid empirical ground motion estimates is obtained for PGA and SA at selected periods for Georgia.",

Of all the days investigated, 25 October 2011 recorded the highest occurrence of scintillation, and it was attributed to geomagnetic storm occurrence. We used the data of 25 October to generate plots of the elevation angle and S4 index against local time on a satellite- by-satellite basis, with a view to distinguishing satellites links whose signals were impaired by ionospheric irregularities from those impaired by multipath. Conclusively, GPS amplitude scintillations over Kampala occur predominantly during post sunset hours and decay around midnight. Equinoctial months recorded the highest occurrences of scintillations, while June solstice recorded the least. Scintillation occurrences also increase with solar and geomagnetic activity.",

During the 2011 and 2014 seismic swarms, more than 1000 triggered records comprising almost 1500 earthquakes were recorded at the permanent station in the mine. Three short-term seismological experiments were accomplished during these swarms. Several temporary seismic stations were simultaneously placed in different parts of underground spaces which enabled comparison of vibration effect caused by near earthquakes in different parts of the mine. Although the depth of the lowest parts of mine is only about 60 m, a vibration effect generated by earthquakes from the Nový Kostel focal zone is not the same for the whole underground complex.",

The proposed method is applied to parameter estimations on 28 sandstone samples, the properties of which have been measured in lab. The water saturated data are used for estimating pore structure and mineral moduli, and the oil saturated data are used for testing these estimated parameters through fluid substitution in Kuster-Toksöz model. We then compare fluid substitution results with lab measurements and find that relative errors of P-wave and S-wave velocities are all less than 5%, which indicates that the estimation results are accurate.",

The observed variability of VΔt in comparison to older results of vertical total electron content (TEC) across similar regions has shown equivalent signatures. Higher monthly mean values of VΔt (MVΔt) were observed during daytime as compared to nighttime (pre- and post-midnight) hours in all months. The highest MVΔt observed in September during daytime hours range between ~6 and ~21 ns (~1.80 and ~6.30 m) and at post-midnight, they are in the range of ~1 to ~6 ns (~0.3 to ~1.80 m). The possible mechanisms responsible for this variability were discussed. Seasonal VΔt were investigated as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a novel method for measuring three-dimensional (3D) water surface dynamics in a partially filled pipe. The study on investigation of the 3D free surface dynamics in partially filled pipes is very limited. The method involves tinting the water white with titanium dioxide so that the water surface appears like a solid surface to image-based measuring systems. This method uses a high-resolution projector to project a stochastic pattern of light onto the water surface and uses two high-resolution cameras to capture the pattern on the deformed water surface. The 3D instantaneous water surface fluctuation can be computed from the images captured by the two cameras using a standard Digital Image Correlation algorithm. It is demonstrated that the surface dynamics parameters of turbulent flow in partially filled pipes, including surface fluctuations and surface velocity, can be measured using the projector, high-resolution cameras and DIC algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lockdown in 2020 implemented due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in a significant improvement in air quality at a global scale. Nationwide lockdown also considerably improved air quality at a local scale, especially in cities which were almost completely shut down during the first coronavirus wave, with nearly no activity. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in the intensity of vehicle traffic causes a drastic decrease in urban air pollution at a local scale. We focused on two urban agglomerations, Warsaw and Cracow, in Poland. Data of the concentrations of traffic-related sources, namely NOx, PM10, and PM2.5, obtained from two air pollution monitoring stations were analyzed for the years 2020 and 2021, during which lockdown and pandemic restrictions were in effect, and for 2019, as a reference. In the years 2020–2021, the average annual concentration of NOx was decreased by ~ 19%, PM2.5 by ~ 19%, and PM10 by ~ 18% in Warsaw, while in Cracow the average annual concentration of NOx was decreased by ~ 16%, PM2.5 by ~ 22%, and PM10 by ~ 2%, compared to 2019. The contribution from traffic-related sources to the overall level of air pollution was estimated. The results indicated that ~ 30 µg/m 3 of PM10, ~ 15 µg/m 3 of PM2.5, and ~ 120 µg/m 3 of NOx in Cracow, and ~ 20 µg/m 3 of PM2.5 in Warsaw originate from moving vehicles. The nationwide lockdown allowed us to conduct this study to understand how a reduction in local traffic emissions can decrease ambient air pollution levels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research work focuses on the wake flow region of a cylinder with a spoiler on a rough bed under steady flow conditions. The acoustic Doppler velocimetry was used for the measurement of three-dimensional velocity data for two Reynolds numbers in a fully developed turbulent flow around the cylinder with a spoiler. The mean flow velocities, second-order turbulence structures, and conditional statistics were investigated in the wake region of the spoilered cylinder. The flow was separated from the spoiler with the formation of two shear layers between free surface flow and recirculating flow. It is observed that the flow is reattaching to the bed at 11 D irrespective of the Reynolds number . Downstream of the cylinder, the mean velocity distributions are asymmetric due to the wall–wake effect, and the point of inflection is observed for each velocity profile at z = 0.40 ẟ . The turbulence intensities, Reynolds stresses, and TKE are highly enhanced in the wake region of the cylinder as compared to their respective upstream values for both runs. The turbulence intensities, Reynolds normal stresses, Reynolds shear stresses, and turbulent kinetic energy are attaining peaks at z = 0.4 ẟ for all the streamwise locations, and the peaks are found to be highest at x = 10 D . The quadrant analysis results indicate that the sweeps are dominating bursting events in the inner and intermediate layers, while ejections are dominating in the outer layer of the wake region. As the hole size, H increases ejections stress fraction rises as compared to that of the sweeps in the wake region for z = 0.2–0.7 h.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work looks at developing an object-driven decision support system (DSS) model with the goal of improving the prediction accuracy of the present expert-driven DSS model in assessing groundwater potentiality. The database of remote sensing, geological, and geophysical information was constructed using the technological efficiency of GIS, data mining, and programming tools. Groundwater potential conditioning factors (GPCF) extracted from the datasets include lithology (Li), hydraulic conductivity ( K ), lineament density (Ld), transmissivity ( T ), and transverse resistance (TR) for groundwater potentiality mapping in a typical hard rock multifaceted geologic setting in south-western Nigeria. A Python-based entropy approach was used to objectively weight these factors. The weightage findings determined that the greatest and lowest given values for Ld and K were 0.6 and 0.03, respectively. The produced Python-based PROMETHEE-Entropy model algorithm was born through combining the weight findings with the Python-based PROMETHEE-II method. The groundwater potentiality model (GPM) map of the area was created using the model algorithm's outputs on the gridded raster of GPCF themes. Based on the suggested approach, the validated results of the created GPM maps using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve technique yielded an accuracy of 86%. An object-driven DSS model was created using the approaches that were used. The created object-driven model is a viable alternative to existing approaches in groundwater hydrology and aids in the automation of groundwater resource management in the research region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We propose a new definition of oblique plate convergence. Our model considers arc-trench curvature on a spherical Earth, and defines obliquity as the angle between the direction of plate convergence and the azimuth from the central point along the arc to the center of curvature of the arcuate trench. We also show how this model may be extended to multiple-arc trenches. We apply this definition to the Western Sunda Arc, which has been traditionally considered the prime example of oblique plate convergence, particularly the segment corresponding to Sumatra. We define eight arc-like segments along this arc-trench system. Obliquity angles on these arc-like segments vary from 92° in the northernmost (Burmese) arc to 7° offshore the Sunda strait (between Sumatra and Java). The angle of obliquity offshore Sumatra is 31°, almost within the definition of slightly oblique convergence. Given the low angle of obliquity, partitioning along the Sumatran fault, in the southern portion of the Western Sunda Arc, is difficult to explain by oblique plate convergence alone. We suggest that the entire segment (or forearc) inboard of the Western Sunda Arc be dragged from the Burmese arc, where overriding and subducting plates are completely coupled and oblique plate convergence is high.",

    "abstract": "The transient storage model is a popular tool for modelling solute transport along rivers. Its use requires values for the velocity and shear flow dispersion coefficient in the main channel of the river together with two exchange rates between the main channel and transient storage zones, which surround the main channel. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge to enable these parameters to be predicted from the type of hydraulic variables that may typically be available. Hence, recourse is made to tracer experiments, which provide temporal solute concentration profiles that can be used to estimate the parameters by optimizing model output to observations. The paper explores the sensitivity of such parameters to the spatial and temporal resolutions used in the optimization of the model. Data from 25 tracer experiments covering a river flow rate range of 300–2250 L/s in a single reach of the river Brock in north-west England were used. The shear flow dispersion coefficient was found to be the most sensitive parameter; the velocity was found to be the least sensitive parameter. When averaged over all the experiments, mean percentage differences in parameter values between a coarse resolution case and a fine resolution case were of the order of 2% for the velocity, 70% for the shear flow dispersion coefficient and 30% and 20% for the two exchange rates. Since the shear flow dispersion coefficient was found to be small, both in numerical terms and in comparison with an estimate of the total dispersion in the reach, it is suggested that it may be viable to omit the shear flow dispersion term from the model.",

    "abstract": "This study appraised optimisations of numerical solutions of the one-dimensional advection–dispersion model (AD-Model) to synthetic data generated using an analytical solution. The motivation for the work was to identify reliable methods for estimating stream solute transport parameters from observed events in small rivers. Numerical solutions of the AD-Model must contend with several effects that might disturb the solution, with the introduction of numerical diffusion and numerical dispersion being particularly important issues. This poses a problem if physical dispersion is being identified by optimising model coefficients using observations of solute transport from field experiments. The discretisation schemes used were the Backward-Time/Centred-Space, Crank–Nicolson, Implicit QUICK, MacCormack and QUICKEST methods. Optimisations were obtained for several grid resolutions by keeping the time step constant whilst varying the space step: the range of Peclet number, Pe, was 1.5–12.0. Generally, increasing the space step led to poorer estimated coefficients and poorer fits to the synthetic concentration profiles. For Pe < 5 only Crank–Nicolson, MacCormack and QUICKEST gave reliable optimised dispersion coefficients: those from Backward-Time/Centred-Space and Implicit QUICK being significantly underestimated. For Pe > 5 Crank–Nicolson and MacCormack gave slightly overestimated dispersion coefficients whilst the other methods gave significantly underestimated dispersion coefficients. These findings were generally consistent with the known presence of numerical diffusion and numerical dispersion in the methods.",

Selected core intervals, log data, and additional crushed samples covered three different boreholes: J-1, L-7, and K-2 from Zielona Góra Basin, localized in western Poland, where J-1 was a reference borehole. Core measurements were performed on the sandstone and conglomerate formations by Gamma Logger GT spectrometer, which uses two scintillation detectors containing bismuth germanate crystals. In the cores, real concentrations of potassium, uranium, and thorium were acquired what enabled to calculate total content of radioactive elements and total uninfluenced by uranium. Delivered new total GR_GLGT curve from cores allowed accurate standardization of archival GR curves from L-7 and K-2 boreholes. Presented results showed a very good correlation between logs, core data, and laboratory analyses. These data allow precise shale volume reinterpretation.",

With a large set of selections possible, model choice is an issue. As a case study, we investigate annual minimum temperatures from measurements at a location in northern Sweden. For practical work, it turns out that care must be taken in examining the obtained distributions, not solely relying on information criteria. A simulation study illustrates the findings.",

Recorded aeromagnetic data were reduced to the magnetic equator before filtering operations which enhanced the magnetic anomalies. Analytic signal map was created, and subsequently a model was generated along a selected profile for better interpretation of the subsurface materials. On the aeroradiometric data were performed both enhancement and statistical operations. The lithological zones were identified. They are metasedimentary rocks, migmatites and igneous rocks occupying varying proportions within the entire area. Some potential radioactive or precious metal ore zones were also localized. A major structure interpreted in the study area trends in the SE–NW direction. Other surface structures were also delineated and general orientation was evaluated. This information may serve as a valuable database for further prospective research and mineral exploration in the region.",

    "abstract": "Firstly, the new single and combined error models applied to estimate the cumulative geoid height error are efficiently produced by the dominating error sources consisting of the gravity gradient of the satellite-equipped gradiometer and the orbital position of the space-borne GPS/GLONASS receiver using the power spectral principle. At degree 250, the cumulative geoid height error is 1.769 × 10−1 m based on the new combined error model, which preferably accords with a recovery accuracy of 1.760 ×10−1 m from the GOCE-only Earth gravity field model GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R2 released in Germany. Therefore, the new combined error model of the cumulative geoid height is correct and reliable in this study. Secondly, the requirements analysis for the future GOCE Follow-On satellite system is carried out in respect of the preferred design of the matching measurement accuracy of key payloads comprising the gravity gradient and orbital position and the optimal selection of the orbital altitude of the satellite. We recommend the gravity gradient with an accuracy of 10−13−10−15 /s2, the orbital position with a precision of 1-0.1 cm and the orbital altitude of 200-250 km in the future GOCE Follow-On mission.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a practical implementation of prestack Kirchhoff time migration (PSTM) on a general purpose graphic processing unit. First, we consider the three main optimizations of the PSTM GPU code, i.e., designing a configuration based on a reasonable execution, using the texture memory for velocity interpolation, and the application of an intrinsic function in device code. This approach can achieve a speedup of nearly 45 times on a NVIDIA GTX 680 GPU compared with CPU code when a larger imaging space is used, where the PSTM output is a common reflection point that is gathered as I[nx][ny][nh][nt] in matrix format. However, this method requires more memory space so the limited imaging space cannot fully exploit the GPU sources. To overcome this problem, we designed a PSTM scheme with multi-GPUs for imaging different seismic data on different GPUs using an offset value. This process can achieve the peak speedup of GPU PSTM code and it greatly increases the efficiency of the calculations, but without changing the imaging result.",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging problems in the estimation of seismic hazard is the ability to quantify seismic activity. Empirical models based on the available earthquake catalogue are often used to obtain activity of source regions. The major limitation with this approach is the lack of sufficient data near a specified source. The non-availability of data poses difficulties in obtaining distribution of earthquakes with large return periods. Such events recur over geological time scales during which tectonic processes, including mantle convection, formation of faults and new plate boundaries, are likely to take place. The availability of geometries of plate boundaries, plate driving forces, lithospheric stress field and GPS measurements has provided numerous insights on the mechanics of tectonic plates. In this article, a 2D finite element model of Indo-Australian plate is developed with the focus of representing seismic activity in India. The effect of large scale geological features including sedimentary basins, fold belts and cratons on the stress field in India is explored in this study. In order to address long term behaviour, the orientation of stress field and tectonic faults of the present Indo- Australian plate are compared with a reconstructed stress field from the early Miocene (20 Ma).",

The local geological pattern, especially subsurface sedimentary layers, belongs to one of the most important factors that influence the amplification of seismic effect on the surface. In order to investigate the amplification effect, there are used methods of spectral ratio that enable to analyse records of vibrations. In the present study, two methods, signed as SSR (standard spectral ratio) and HVSR (horizontal to vertical spectral ratio), were used for the site effect evaluation. The analysis was performed in the populated Doubrava locality where high seismic loading on the surface due to mining induced seismicity is documented.",

For this, gravity at a distance x from the origin and horizontal derivative at that point are utilized. A numerical value is obtained dividing the gravity at point x by horizontal derivative. Then a new equation is obtained dividing the theoretical gravity equation by the derivative equation. In that equation, assigning various values to the depth and length of vertical line, several new numerical values are obtained. Among these values, a curve is obtained for the one that is closest to the first value from attending the depth and length values. The intersection point of these curves obtained by repeating this procedure several times for different points x yield the real depth and length values of the line. The method is tested on two synthetics and field examples. Successful results are obtained in both applications.",

    "abstract": "Volume change of oil between reservoir condition and standard surface condition is called oil formation volume factor (FVF), which is very time, cost and labor intensive to determine. This study proposes an accurate, rapid and cost-effective approach for determining FVF from reservoir temperature, dissolved gas oil ratio, and specific gravity of both oil and dissolved gas. Firstly, structural risk minimization (SRM) principle of support vector regression (SVR) was employed to construct a robust model for estimating FVF from the aforementioned inputs. Subsequently, an alternating conditional expectation (ACE) was used for approximating optimal transformations of input/output data to a higher correlated data and consequently developing a sophisticated model between transformed data. Eventually, a committee machine with SVR and ACE was constructed through the use of hybrid genetic algorithm-pattern search (GA-PS). Committee machine integrates ACE and SVR models in an optimal linear combination such that makes benefit of both methods. A group of 342 data points was used for model development and a group of 219 data points was used for blind testing the constructed model. Results indicated that the committee machine performed better than individual models.",

Based on the instrument, experiments were carried out at Langfang (39.40° N, 116.65° E) site for a rough comparison and Kelan (38.71° N, 111.58° E) site for a detailed validation. Wind results of Langfang experiment are well consistent with measurements of two other FPIs deployed at Xinglong (40.40° N, 117.59° E) and Kelan which are retrieved by the American National Center for Atmospheric Research (A-NCAR). In Kelan experiment, the averaged wind deviation between our FPI and A-NCAR FPI is 11.8 m/s. The averaged deviation of wind measurement error between them is 2.9 m/s. The comparisons suggest good agreement. Then, the analysis of influencing factors was made. The center determination offset has an exponential relation with wind deviation, while the radius calculation offset is linear with wind deviation.",

    "abstract": "PASSEQ 2006–2008 (Passive Seismic Experiment in TESZ; Wilde-Piórko et al. 2008) was the biggest passive seismic experiment carried out so far in the area of Central Europe (Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Lithuania). 196 seismic stations (including 49 broadband seismometers) worked simultaneously for over two years. During the experiment, multiple types of data recorders and seismometers were used, making the analysis more complex and time consuming. The dataset was unified and repaired to start the detection of local seismic events. Two different approaches for detection were applied for stations located in Poland. The first one used standard STA/LTA triggers (Carl Johnson's STA/LTA algorithm) and grid search to classify and locate the events. The result was manually verified. The second approach used Real Time Recurrent Network (RTRN) detection (Wiszniowski et al. 2014). Both methods gave similar results, showing four previously unknown seismic events located in the Gulf of Gdańsk area, situated in the southern Baltic Sea. In this paper we discuss both detection methods with their pros and cons (accuracy, efficiency, manual work required, scalability). We also show details of all detected and previously unknown events in the discussed area.",

A direct comparison between injection rate changes and b value response is attempted after appropriate selection of data subsets. Due to the relatively small sample (1121 events, corresponding to an average rate of ~ 0.45 events/day), we also aggregated seismic activity into two families corresponding to increasing and decreasing injection rates, respectively. The b values were calculated as a function of time lag related to the injection activity. In agreement with previous studies, we found a statistically significant direct relation between b values and injection rate changes, which occurred at a zero or very short time lag (from 0 to ~ 15 days). However, the b value changes are related to the slope (i.e., the second derivative of injection volume), instead of the absolute values of injection rates. The increasing injection rates correspond to b = 1.18 ± 0.06, whereas the decreasing injection rates correspond to b = 1.10 ± 0.05. The corresponding values estimated by the repeated medians technique are b = 1.97 ± 0.20 and b = 1.50 ± 0.13. Both differences are significant at 0.05 level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Onshore seismic exploration analyzes seismic wave propagation in elastic media, which includes the conversion between P- and S-waves. The development of multi-wave and multi-component seismic exploration methods provides data that enable onshore elastic wave full-waveform inversion. However, most data sets of onshore exploration are single component obtained from the particle-motion response from the vertical geophone. When the aiming area has a low-velocity zone, the ray path of reflected wave that propagates to the detector is nearly perpendicular to the ground surface, so that we call it P-wave data. In this paper, we focus on multi-parameter waveform inversion using P-wave reflection seismic data. Although only P-wave data are received, it still contains the converted P-wave information, and the converted P-wave energy gradually increases as the offset increases. As seismic acquisition technology, observation systems and science develop, the folds and acquisition offset increase significantly, and the seismic data contain important converted P-wave information. In this paper, the first-order elastic velocity–stress equation is decomposed to obtain the scalar-P-wave equation from which the S-wave velocity is included firstly. Then we present the theoretical framework for onshore multi-parameter full-waveform inversion using P-wave data. In order to explore the inversion potential of the P-wave data (extracting the S-wave velocity from the converted P-wave information) and accuracy and stability of the P- and S-wave velocity inverted by our method, we carry out numerical tests via different inversion strategies, by using the P-wave data regarded as containing converted P-wave information, and get successful results.",

    "abstract": "A generally anisotropic elasticity tensor can be related to its closest counterparts in various symmetry classes. We refer to these counterparts as effective tensors in these classes. In finding effective tensors, we do not assume a priori orientations of their symmetry planes and axes. Knowledge of orientations of Hookean solids allows us to infer properties of materials represented by these solids. Obtaining orientations and parameter values of effective tensors is a highly nonlinear process involving finding absolute minima for orthogonal projections under all three-dimensional rotations. Given the standard deviations of the components of a generally anisotropic tensor, we examine the influence of measurement errors on the properties of effective tensors. We use a global optimization method to generate thousands of realizations of a generally anisotropic tensor, subject to errors. Using this optimization, we perform a Monte Carlo analysis of distances between that tensor and its counterparts in different symmetry classes, as well as of their orientations and elasticity parameters.",

Based on the geological conditions of gas hydrate reservoir in the Qilian Mountain permafrost, by establishing high-resistance abnormal model for gas hydrate and carrying out numerical simulation using finite element method (FEM) and nonlinear conjugate gradient (NLCG) method, this paper analyzed the application range of AMT method and the best acquisition parameters setting scheme. When porosity of gas hydrate reservoir is less than 5%, gas hydrate saturation is greater than 70%, occurrence scale is less than 50 m, or bury depth is greater than 500 m, AMT technique cannot identify and delineate the favorable gas hydrate reservoir. Survey line should be more than twice the length of probable occurrence scale, while tripling the length will make the best result. The number of stations should be no less than 6, and 11 stations are optimal. At the high frequency section (10∼1000 Hz), there should be no less than 3 frequency points, 4 being the best number.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tortuosity is a significant parameter in porous materials analysis. Not only, when it comes to rocks or soils but also cellular materials, alloys or cells, the multiple definitions exist for tortuosity and several purposes. Geometrical tortuosity describes the pore network paths; on the other hand thermal, diffusional, electrical and hydraulic tortuosity refers to the transport processes in the pore network. Computed X-ray tomography (CT) is the best solution in tortuosity estimation, thanks to the 3D images. In particular, computed X-ray tomography, together with mercury porosimetry (MICP), pulse- and pressure-decay permeability methods (PDP), as well as electrical parameter measurements (EPM), links and expands the information about the tortuosity into the greater meaning. The geological material was composed of tight, low-porosity and low-permeability gas-saturated rocks cored from the present depth of deposition below 3000 m, containing different lithologies, as sandstones, mudstones, limestones, and dolomites. The research presents the novel approach in the identification and analysis of the main pore channels based on 3D CT images. Algorithm of the central axis identifies and analyzes the whole main flow path and calculates tortuosity. High correlation was observed between the tortuosity and Swanson parameter from mercury porosimetry data. Moreover, the high correlation was detected between the tortuosity and saturation exponent from electrical parameter measurement in analyzed tight low-porosity and low-permeability deposits. Multilinear regression (MLR) allows estimating absolute permeability taking CT, MICP and EPM parameters into consideration. Combination of these parameters in one equation with high determination coefficient gives credence in estimating preliminary absolute permeability (PDP) based on the data which is executed as standard core analysis (MICP and EPM) and data from the non-invasive method (CT).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of meteorological radars in monitoring current weather conditions is crucial regarding the observation of the evolution and dissipation of thunderstorms. Thus, Doppler velocities being measured in each radar scan and velocity vectors derived from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models—that are usually not as highly resolving as radar scans—are combined, as a monitoring utility during the evolution of a convective weather event. The objective of this study is to develop a new method that allows the implementation of a thunderstorm movement velocity estimation technique combining block matching and optical flow techniques. This new method constitutes a nowcasting (NWC) application that enables the use of a single Doppler radar without the need of using NWPs. The method relies on the estimation of the thunderstorm movement vector velocities (Doppler velocity) for each constant altitude plan position indicator (CAPPI) and through correction for aliasing errors to obtain 3D vector velocity fields for convective systems. The performance of the method is evaluated for selected case studies of convective thunderstorms under different synoptic scale conditions over Greece, a geographical area with challenges in forecasting due to its sharp relief and the need for optimization of the use of radar products.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous studies have suggested prominent variations in the seismic wave behavior at the 5 s period when traveling across the Valley of Mexico, associating them with the crustal structure and contributing to the anomalous seismic wave patterns observed each time an earthquake hits Mexico City. This article confirms the variations observed at 0.2 Hz by analyzing the Green tensor diagonal retrieved from empirical Green functions (EGF) calculated using seismic noise data cross-correlations of the vertical and horizontal components. We observe time and phase shifts between the east and north EGF components and show that they can be explained by the crustal structure from the surface up to 20 km depth; we also observe that the time and phase shifts are more significant if the distance between the source and the station increases. Additionally, the article presents an updated version of the velocity model from receiver functions and dispersion curves (VMRFDC v2.0) for the crustal structure under the Valley of Mexico. To validate this model, we compare the EGFs with synthetic Green functions determined numerically. To do so, we adaptatively meshed this model using an iterative algorithm to numerically simulate the impulse response up to 0.5 Hz. Finally, the comparisons between noise and synthetic EGF showed that the VMRFDC v2.0 model explains the time shifts and phase differences at 0.2 Hz, previously observed by independent studies, suggesting it correctly characterizes the crustal structure anomalies beneath the Valley of Mexico.",

Additionally, we investigated the radio images of eight fine structures – two flags, two sails and four dots.

    "abstract": "Abstract The accurate interpretation of well-logging data is a crucial stage in the exploration of gas- and oil-bearing reservoirs. Geological formations, such as the Miocene deposits, present many challenges related to thin layers, whose thickness is often less than the measurement resolution. This research emphasizes the potential of utilizing electrofacies in such challenging environments. The application of electrofacies not only allows for the grouping of intervals with similar physical characteristics but can also be useful for estimating porosity and permeability parameters. For this purpose, various clustering methods were tested, including the 2D indexed and probabilized self-organizing map (IPSOM) method with and without supervision. Subsequently, the usefulness of the obtained results to improve the estimation of porosity and permeability parameters with the help of artificial neural networks was verified. As a result of the conducted analyses, significantly better results were obtained compared to classical petrophysical interpretation. The calculated porosity and permeability parameters were characterized by much greater variability and alignment with laboratory measurements on porosity and permeability. The best results were obtained for the IPSOM method, but the other methods did not differ significantly. In conclusion, the studies have shown a positive result of applying clustering methods, including the IPSOM method, to improve the estimation of permeability and porosity parameters in complicated, thinly-layered formations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study reports observations of Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGE) that occurred in Southern Finland in the Municipality of Vantaa (60° 18’ N 24° 58’ E at 55 m a.m.s.l) on May 17th, 2020 between 10:23 and 10:28 UTC. The TGEs occurred when a storm front moved across the Helsinki region from roughly a southwest to northeast direction. The TGEs were caused by a Runaway Relativistic Electron Avalanche (RREA) occurring inside a thundercloud. Three independent measuring units of high-volume NaI(Tl) γ spectrometers were used to record ambient dose rate and γ spectra. The observed TGEs manifested themselves as sudden increases in γ radiation on the ground with a wide range of energies from 100 keV up to the maximum of the detector system of 8.8 MeV. The first event lasted 50 s and produced an increase in γ radiation of about 7–12% in the spectra measured with a ten-second collection time. The enhancement in γ radiation was terminated suddenly and simultaneously with an in-cloud lightning strike. This was followed by an 88–100 s long period when the level of γ radiation returned to normal values. After this, a second enhancement was observed to increase the level of γ radiation by 20–50%. The second enhancement lasted 100 s and it was also terminated simultaneously with an in-cloud lightning flash. The second enhancement appears to be stronger, but the exact locations of the thundercloud emitting the γ radiation were not known. From the duration of the second enhancement and the prevailing wind speed, the size of the RREA was estimated to be 400–1000 m. In the second enhancement, the most intense increase was between 100 and 1000 keV, although very-high-energy γ rays was observed up to 8.8 MeV. The shape of the background-subtracted γ spectra agreed well with the observations and predictions of the shape of the bremsstrahlung spectrum emitted by an RREA. Additionally, in the background-subtracted spectra, a minor enhancement of the 511 keV peak was also observed where the RREA also increased the number of positrons which annihilated and increased the emission of the 511 keV γ rays. The results of these high-latitude, low-altitude TGE events are the first ones report in Finland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The article describes the establishment of the location of agate geodes using the GPR method in the area of the Simota gully (Lesser Poland Voivodeship). Agates (a multicolored variety of gemstone of chalcedony group) have multifaceted values that informed their study. Traditional methods of geode location are less reliable, hence the attempt to use the GPR method. Measurements were taken at two study test sites with subsurface geology of weathered melaphyre and pyroclastic deposits using a GPR system (ProEx). A high-frequency antenna (1.6 GHz) was used along with the pre-established profiles of lengths of 6-m and 10-cm intervals. Furthermore, simple soil tests using the soil sampler tool were made prior to the GPR measurement. The GPR results show significant high attenuation of the electromagnetic energy interpreted to be due to clay components of the regolith. Advanced signal processing procedures (such as the attribute of the signal) were used on the data for better enhancement that aided interpretation. Other anomalies depicted on the radargrams were thought to be the presence of roots, pieces of melaphyres-targeted agates. Furtherance to ascertain the reflection coefficients as recorded on the GPR data, in situ samples (root pieces, melaphyres, agates) taken were tested in the laboratory for electric permittivity property. Based on the interpretation results, several agate geodes were dug out from the ground.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The derivation of geomechanical properties from petrophysical/geophysical data is not only of great importance in the oil industry but also in mining, geothermal projects and tunnelling, for reduction of costs and to improve security. For the oil industry and geothermal sector, it is mainly important for drilling rate and the stability of the borehole and, as a result, the economic factor. A key issue is that geomechanical properties, which can support a better planning of a project, cannot be measured in the borehole or on the surface directly. In this study, the focus is put on anisotropic effects on the correlation between static and dynamic properties, which is neglected in most studies but important because values can vary extremely. Therefore, measurements in the geotechnical laboratory of compressional and shear wave velocity during uniaxial compression strength test were taken. Additionally, typical properties like bulk and grain density as well as porosity were determined too. Different samples (carbonate–silica schist, marble and phyllite) from the \"Zentrum am Berg\"-research tunnelling centre at the \"Erzberg\" in Austria were used. Shown are correlations between uniaxial compression strength and compressional wave velocity as well as for static and dynamic Young’s modulus including their anisotropic effect. The results are promising and provide an opportunity for further applications on log data.",

In the first one, the SST data are the disturbing potential differences between twin-satellites and in the second one the line-of-sight (LOS) gravity disturbances. It is shown that the corresponding integral kernels are well-behaving and therefore suitable for inversion and recovery of the stress function from the SST data. Recovery of the stress function and the stress components is also tested in numerical experiments using simulated SST data. Numerical studies over the Himalayas show that inverting the disturbing potential differences leads to a smoother stress function than from inverting LOS gravity disturbances. Application of the presented integral formulae allows for recovery of the stress from the satellite mission GRACE and its planned successor.",

This is done, on the one hand, by sampling the satellite observations in another direction using the pendulum satellite mission configuration. On the other hand, a mitigation of the temporal aliasing errors in the ocean tides can be achieved by using a suitable repeat period of the sub-satellite tracks. The findings show, firstly, that it is very beneficial for minimizing the aliasing errors in ocean tides to use pendulum configuration; secondly, optimizing the orbital parameter to get shorter repeat orbit mode can be effective in minimizing the aliasing errors. This paper recommends the pendulum as a candidate for future gravity mission to be launched in longer repeating orbit mode with shorter “sub-cycle” repeat periods to improve the temporal resolution of the satellite mission.",

The analytical expressions for displacements, strain and stresses in the two half spaces are obtained first for line source and then for dip slip fault. The results for two particular cases, adiabatic conditions and isothermal conditions, are also obtained. Numerical results for displacements, stresses and temperature distribution have also been computed and are shown.",

    "abstract": "AVO inversion is hard to be efficiently applied in unexploited fields due to the insufficiency of well information. For the sake of AVO inversion in a well-absent area, the most conventional method is to construct pseudo well-logs by defining seismic processing velocity as the P-velocity and computing S-velocity and density using empirical formulas, yet the resolution of the corresponding earth models and final inverted results could be extremely low, and a rough formula could destroy the inversion thoroughly. To overcome this problem, an amplitudenormalized pseudo well-log construction method that reconstructs pseudo well-logs in accordance with computed P-wave reflection amplitudes and nearby drilling data is proposed in this paper. It enhances the inversion resolution efficiently with respect to the real elastic parameter relationships, so that the corresponding AVO inversion results are reasonably improved. In summary, the proposed method is successfully applied in the AVO inversion of a well-absent marine area, and could be valuable in the early phase, particularly of the offshore hydrocarbon exploration.",

The folds include tilted (dips 4–75°) Middle Ordovician (early Darriwilian) layered carbonate strata that were studied by mineralogical, palaeomagnetic, and rock magnetic methods in order to specify the postsedimentational history of the area and to obtain a better control over the palaeogeographic position of Baltica during the Ordovician. Mineralogical studies revealed that (titano)magnetite, hematite, and goethite are carriers of magnetization. Based on data from 5 sites that positively passed a DC tilt test, a south-easterly downward directed component A (Dref = 154.6°± 15.3°, Iref = 60.9°± 9.7°) was identified. The component is carried by (titano)magnetite, dates to the Middle Ordovician (Plat = 17.9°, Plon = 47.3°, K = 46.7, A95 = 11.3°), and places Baltica at mid-southerly latitudes. Observations suggest that in sites that do not pass the tilt test, the glaciotectonic event has caused some rotation of blocks around their vertical axis.",

We found that tini and tac are crucial for evolution. All other parameters are also important, but no dramatic differences are found for realistic values. The process of differentiation is also investigated. It is found that liquid state convection could delay the differentiation for hundreds of My. The results are confronted with observational data from Cassini spacecraft. It is possible that differentiation is fully completed but the density of formed core is close to the mean density. If this interpretation is correct, then Rhea could have accreted any time before 3–4 My after formation of CAI.",

It is well recognised that there is no single universal location algorithm which performs equally well in all situations. Source activity and its spatial variability in time, the geometry of recording network, the complexity and heterogeneity of wave velocity distribution are all factors influencing the performance of location algorithms. In this paper we propose a new location algorithm which exploits the reciprocity and time-inverse invariance property of the wave equation. Basing on these symmetries and using a modern finite-difference-type eikonal solver, we have developed a new very fast algorithm performing the full probabilistic (Bayesian) source location. We illustrate an efficiency of the algorithm performing an advanced error analysis for 1647 seismic events from the Rudna copper mine operating in southwestern Poland.",

This paper reports the magnetic mapping of the shelf zone in the SE part of the Wilhelm Archipelago, West Antarctica, based on magnetic surveys conducted with Zodiac boats. A spectacular feature of this area is the strong magnetic anomaly of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) batholith, which was the product of subduction-related Mesozoic–Cenozoic arc magmatism on the former margin of Western Gondwana. We constructed and analyzed a detailed magnetic map of magnetic field anomalies using field observations of rock exposures on the islands and magnetic properties of rocks from laboratory data. The oldest volcanic rocks of Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous age relate to N-NE trending bands of negative magnetic field. The largest feature in the study area is an Upper Cretaceous/Paleogene granodiorite complex that produces a positive magnetic anomaly. Many smaller anomalies are also present over gabbroid bodies of Cretaceous age. Two-dimensional magnetic modeling shows that heterogeneities in the upper crust may have magnetic susceptibilities in the range of 0.005–0.13 SI. Magnetic field anomalies also delineate an orthogonal system of tectonic faults, including the main NE fault along the Penola Strait (sub-parallel to the AP coastline) and four intersecting faults. These fault systems may be associated with different stages of continental margin evolution along the Antarctic Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper discusses the radiation budget and its temporal variability over Poland. The data analysis is based on the MERRA-2 reanalysis for the years 1980–2020. During the last four decades, the enhancement of climate warming has been observed, which coincides with the changes in the radiation budget. Positive and statistically significant trends at the top of the atmosphere (TOA; 0.7 ± 0.2 W/m 2 /10 year) and on the Earth’s surface (1.5 ± 0.2 W/m 2 /10 year) radiation budget (net downward flux) are mainly a consequence of changes in the amount of aerosol and greenhouse gases (GHG). According to MERRA-2, the AOD during this period decreased by − 0.19 (at 550 nm), which is 87% of the long-term (1980–2021) mean value (0.22). The reduction of AOD is due mainly to the decline of non-absorbing sulfate particles, which leads to a reduction of single-scattering albedo (SSA) by − 0.008 per decade and Angstrom exponent (AE) by − 0.06 per decade (both trends statistically significant). On the other hand, the GHG concentration increased by 4.9%/10 year and 3%/10 year, respectively, for CO 2 and CH 4 . The total column of water vapor increased (1.3%/10 year), while ozone decreased (− 1%/10 year). Despite the fact that cloud cover and cloud optical depth (COD) decreased (− 1.8%/10 year and − 1.0%/10 year), the impact of cloud on temporal variability radiation budget is small. It can be explained by nearly compensated shortwave (SW) cooling and longwave (LW) heating effects. During the analysis period, near-surface air temperature increased by 2.0 °C. The estimated increase in SW net surface radiation (7.9 W/m 2 ) leads to climate warming by 0.8 °C, which is a consequence mainly of the reduction of aerosol (0.4 °C) and cloud cover (0.2 °C). The impact of the change of SW radiation on air temperature is more pronounced during the warm season, while during the cold, air temperature change is controlled mainly by the variability of air mass advection.",

As polarization angles are necessary for more advanced procedures like anisotropy parameters determination, their quality is critical for proper media description. Examined Wysin-1 VSP experiment data indicated that the best results can be obtained when rotation is performed for each shot on data after de-noising and vertical stacking of un-rotated data. Additionally, we proposed a procedure of signal matching that can substantially increase data quality.",

    "abstract": "To acquire refined seismic targets, the use of more accurate and more precise methods of seismic signal processing is crucial. Novel seismic processing approach is even more important in case of the complex geology of mountainous regions (e.g., Carpathians, Carpathian Foredeep) where sub-vertical layering of varying rock complex can be found, but also in case of old seismic data reprocessing (especially when the signal-to-noise ratio and general quality are low). Regardless of many research papers and significant progress in seismic processing techniques, a properly processed and interpreted seismic image is still hardly affordable for this region. Obtaining a new value in seismic data processing is a core function of the presented research. The use of dip-guided filtering combined with beam partitioned analysis and Z-domain dip analysis for reprocessing of 3D and 2D seismic data from the Carpathians region has been studied.",

The aim of the present study is to investigate, through a synthetic test, the possibility of using empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) to observe the variations in the reservoir. In the synthetic test, we reproduce the expected seismic activity (in terms of rate, focal mechanisms, stress drop and the b value of the Gutenberg-Richter) and the variation of medium properties in terms of the quality factor Q induced by a fluid injection experiment. In practice, peak-ground velocity data of the simulated earthquakes during the field operations are used to update the coefficients of a reference GMPE in order to test whether the coefficients are able to capture the medium properties variation. The results of the test show that the coefficients of the GMPE vary during the simulated field operations revealing their sensitivity to the variation of the anelastic attenuation. The proposed approach is suggested as a promising tool that, if confirmed by real data analysis, could be used for monitoring and interpreting induced seismicity in addition to more conventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Deep copper ore mines in Poland have been struggling with seismic hazard since almost fifty years ago when the first rock burst occurred. Increasing exploitation depth and mined-out space make the mining conditions constrained and severe causing the seismic activity to grow substantially. Consequently, rock burst preventive activities have to be incorporated into mining technology to provide work safety. To date, the group winning blasting has posed the most commonly used preventive measure, so its efficiency in seismic energy reduction is of significant importance for the rock burst hazard mitigation. The more energy blasting works provoke to release the safer the work environment gets. The article aimed to assess the efficiency of such an energy reduction, which was approached in two ways. Firstly, the drop of energy and in turn its reduction efficiency was assessed simply using a percentage of provoked tremors’ energy and number. Next, the analysis employed passive seismic tomography results to find if provoked tremors took place in high-velocity zones. The analysis made it possible to verify the assumption that the more provoked energy occurs in such zones the more successful preventive blasting is.",

The aim of this study was to verify manufacturing assumptions of the structure of materials, since phantoms are used for BSD-DTI calibration directly after manufacturing. Visualization of the phantoms' structure was achieved through optical microscopy and high-resolution computed microtomography (µCT). Using µCT images, a numerical model of the materials structure was developed for further quantitative analysis. 3D image characterization was performed to determine crucial structural parameters of the phantom: porosity, uniformity and distribution of equivalent diameter of capillary bundles. Additionally calculations of hypothetical flow streamlines were also performed based on the numerical model that was developed. The results obtained in this study can be used in the calibration of DTI-BST measurements. However, it was found that the structure of the phantom exhibits flaws and discrepancies from the assumed geometry which might affect BSD-DTI calibration.",

Spectrometric data from borehole geophysical probe (borehole 1) and portable gamma logger (borehole 2) were used to analyze shale formations. The results from borehole 1 presented a statistically significant, moderate correlation between calculated hydrocarbon anomalies and hydrocarbon saturation data obtained from well log interpretation. Borehole 2 has been analyzed focusing on the gamma radiation of the core samples, and the positive results of borehole 1. Hydrocarbon anomalies calculated from spectral gamma radiation are reliable indicators of sweet spots, based solely on a cursory evaluation of core measurements. These preliminary information acquired from gamma-ray measurements could help increase sampling precision of further geochemical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Shallow seismic survey was made along 1280 m profile in the marginal zone of the Carpathian Foredeep. Measurements performed with standalone wireless stations and especially designed accelerated weight drop system resulted in high fold (up to 60), long offset seismic data. The acquisition has been designed to gather both high-resolution reflection and wide-angle refraction data at long offsets. Seismic processing has been realised separately in two paths with focus on the shallow and deep structures. Data processing for the shallow part combines the travel time tomography and the wide angle reflection imaging. This difficult analysis shows that a careful manual front mute combined with correct statics leads to detailed recognition of structures between 30 and 200 m. For those depths, we recognised several SW dipping tectonic displacements and a main fault zone that probably is the main fault limiting the Roztocze Hills area, and at the same time constitutes the border of the Carpathian Forebulge. The deep interpretation clearly shows a NE dipping evaporate layer at a depth of about 500–700 m. We also show limitations of our survey that leads to unclear recognition of the first 30 m, concluding with the need of joint interpretation with other geophysical methods.",

    "abstract": "The gamma distribution functions with one shape parameter, employed to describe the parametric hydrograph, proved ineffective for the upper Vistula River and the middle Oder River water regions. It was therefore necessary to find a different function. The Pearson Type IV distribution functions proposed by Strupczewski with one and two shape parameters were analyzed for their applicability based on the data acquired from 60 water gauges, 30 of which were located on the Vistula River and the other 30 were on the Oder River. The shape parameter (parameters) and the time of rising limb were optimized based on the calculated hydrograph widths at 50% and 75% of peak flow (W50 and W75) as well as on the skewness coefficient s. The calculated parametric hydrographs were compared with the nonparametric input hydrographs with regard to the closeness of their volumes and the position of their centers of gravity. Both Pearson Type IV distribution functions proved to fit well. However, the function with two shape parameters did not yield the exact solution since the condition of the assumed objective function was met by a very large group of pairs of m and n shape parameters. It was therefore assumed that the recommended function is the Pearson Type IV distribution with one shape parameter. This function has an additional advantage of having an inflection point located between the W50 and W75, which allows to use the exponential function for the rising or recession limb that better describes either part of the hydrograph.",

    "abstract": "In thin-bedded sandy–shaly Miocene formations of the Carpathian Foredeep, the main source of errors in gas saturation evaluation is the underestimation of resistivity of thin, hydrocarbon-bearing beds, which is the result of the low vertical resolution of induction logging tools. This problem is especially visible in older boreholes drilled in times where the Dual Induction Tool (DIT) was the primary induction tool used for determining the formation resistivity, and in shallowest depth intervals of newer boreholes where the DIT was used instead of newer array tools for cost-saving reasons. In this paper, we show how a global inversion algorithm was used to improve the vertical resolution of DIT logs. Our implementation of an iterative inversion utilizes a one-dimensional formation model, vertical response functions of the DIT, and a modified simulated annealing algorithm to determine the true vertical distribution of the formation resistivity. The algorithm was tested on resistivity logs recorded in a borehole drilled in the Carpathian Foredeep in Poland, where the DIT and the High-Resolution Array Induction (HRAI) tool were run in the same depth interval.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chałupki Dębniańskie seismic profile 2D–3C is located in Carpathian Foredeep basin, Poland, and is an object of interest for geologists and geophysicists due to the presence of gas-bearing layers. Multicomponent seismic plays a significant role in supporting reservoir analysis related to accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. The purpose of the research was the optimal processing workflow design, which integrated seismic images of three-component 2D seismic line (2D–3C seismic). A complete processing flow for vertical and both horizontal components was conducted to obtain stacks and prestack gathers with preserved amplitude relations (RAP processing). The main issue of the research was the interpretation of S-wave velocity, which was not provided by well log data. The obtained results increased the reliability of seismic interpretation within Chałupki Dębniańskie area. The research provided valuable information regarding amplitude anomalies and helped in the verification of the potential gas accumulations. Several reservoir analysis tools were tested, including seismic attributes and AVO analysis. Conducted research confirmed the existence of reservoir which is characterized by good reservoir parameters.",

A continuous radon monitoring station was implemented in Jooshan hotspring, Kerman province, south east Iran. The location was carefully chosen as a widely reported earthquake-prone zone. A common issue during monitoring of radon gas concentration is the possibility of noise disturbance by different environmental and instrumental parameters. A systematic mathematical analysis aiming at reducing such noises from data is reported here; for the first time, the Kalman filter (KF) has been used for radon gas concentration monitoring. The filtering is incorporated based on several seismic parameters of the area under study. A novel anomaly defined as \"radon concentration spike crossing\" is also introduced and successfully used in the study. Furthermore, for the first time, a mathematical pattern of a relationship between the radius of potential precursory phenomena and the distance between epicenter and the monitoring station is reported and statistically analyzed.",

The theory of magnetovariation and magnetotelluric soundings was generalised or corrected. Spatial derivatives of response functions (induction arrows) were obtained for the ultra-long periods. New phenomena have been detected by this method: secular variations of the Earth’s apparent resistivity and the rapid changes of induction arrows over the last 50 years. The first one can be correlated with the number of earthquakes, and the second one–with geomagnetic jerks in Central Europe. The extensive studies of geoelectrical structure of the crust and mantle were realized in the frame of a series of international projects. New information about geoelectrical structures of the crust in Northern Europe and Ukraine was obtained by deep electromagnetic soundings involving controlled powerful sources. An influence of the crust magnetic permeability on the deep sounding results was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "In geochemical logging, the standard capture gamma-ray spectra of Al, Mg, and K have no distinct characteristic energy peaks. This feature easily influences the spectral bands of characteristic peaks of other elements and thus affects the accuracy of calculating their concentrations. To study this influence, we constructed a model formation containing Al, Mg, and K, and employed the Monte Carlo N Particle Transport Code (MCNP) program to simulate their capture spectra. The results indicate that the calculated dry weights of Si are almost free from the influences of Mg, K, and Al. The ones of Ca and Fe are influenced, but only to a minor extent. The dry weight of S is concurrently influenced. Specifically, the K concentration causes S concentration to deviate significantly from its real concentration. By correcting for such influences, we can obtain relatively accurate values. Data processing for a real well validates the finding that Mg, Al, and K in the formation influence the precision of calculation of other elements and also testifies to the effectiveness of the correction method.",

During the period of observation (June-December 2011), we found 89 cases of VLF perturbation, while only 73 cases showing early character associated with strong lightning discharges. Out of 73 events, 64 (~84%) of the early VLF perturbations are found to be early/slow in nature; the remaining 9 events are early/fast. The onset duration of these early/slow VLF perturbations is up to ~ 5 s. A total of 54 observed early events show amplitude change lying between ± 3.0 dB, and phase change ± 12 degree, respectively, and found to occur mainly during nighttime. One of the interesting results we found is that the events with larger recovery time lie far away from the VLF propagation path, while events with smaller duration of recovery are within the ± 50–100 km of signal path. The World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) data is analysed to find the location of causative lightning and temporal variation. The lightning discharge and associated processes that lead to early VLF events are discussed.",

Values of magnetic susceptibility (χ) are relatively low; however, they reveal significant differences between investigated sites. The values of χ around “Abille” wreck were 5-8×10-8 m3/kg. Around “Munin” wreck results were more diversified reaching value of χ between 3.07×10-8m3/kg and 12.92×10-8 m3/kg. The spatial variability of χ coincided with near-bottom water currents distribution in the Gulf of Gdańsk. Magnetic minerals were identified by thermomagnetic analysis. Around “Abille” wreck we have found magnetite with small amount of maghemite or hematite. The “Munin” sediments include only one magnetic phase; in several samples it is magnetite, in the others — maghemite. Day—Dunlop plot shows that “Abille” set is shifted towards lower magnetization ratio and higher coercivity ratio. The correlation between the distribution of χ and hydrodynamic condition around shipwrecks allows to determine the direction of contaminant transport.",

The seismic structure has been characterized by the slope of the recurrence plot γ, fractal dimension D, concentration parameter Ksr, Hurst exponents Hr and Ht. The values of D, γ, Ksr, Hr, and Ht diminished many months before the principal seismic shock (M = 6.9) of the studied seismoactive zone has occurred.

The timeaveraged streamwise velocity, Reynolds shear and normal stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, higher-order moments of velocity fluctuations, length scales, and the turbulent bursting were measured over a gravel-bed with an array of larger gravels. It was observed that the turbulence characteristics do not vary significantly above the crest level of the array as compared to those below the array. The nondimensional streamwise velocity decreases considerably with a decrease in depth below the array. Below the array, the Reynolds shear stress (RSS) deviates from the gravity- law of RSS distributions. Turbulence intensities reduce below the crest level of the gravel-bed. The third-order moments of velocity fluctuations increase below the crest level of the gravel-bed and give a clear indication of sweeps as the predominating event which were further verified with the quadrant analysis plots. The turbulent length scales values change significantly below the crest level of the gravel-bed.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of seismic refraction and wide angle reflection data usually involves the creation of a velocity model based on an inverse or forward modelling of the travel times of crustal and mantle phases using the ray theory approach. The modelling codes differ in terms of model parameterization, data used for modelling, regularization of the result, etc. It is helpful to know the capabilities, advantages and limitations of the code used compared to others. This work compares some popular 2D seismic modelling codes using the dataset collected along the seismic wide-angle profile DOBRE-4, where quite peculiar/uncommon reflected phases were observed in the wavefield. The ~505 km long profile was realized in southern Ukraine in 2009, using 13 shot points and 230 recording stations. Double PMP phases with a different reduced time (7.5–11 s) and a different apparent velocity, intersecting each other, are observed in the seismic wavefield. This is the most striking feature of the data. They are interpreted as reflections from strongly dipping Moho segments with an opposite dip. Two steps were used for the modelling. In the previous work by Starostenko et al. (2013), the trial-and-error forward model based on refracted and reflected phases (SEIS83 code) was published. The interesting feature is the high-amplitude (8–17 km) variability of the Moho depth in the form of downward and upward bends. This model is compared with results from other seismic inversion methods: the first arrivals tomography package FAST based on first arrivals; the JIVE3D code, which can also use later refracted arrivals and reflections; and the forward and inversion code RAYINVR using both refracted and reflected phases. Modelling with all the codes tested showed substantial variability of the Moho depth along the DOBRE-4 profile. However, SEIS83 and RAYINVR packages seem to give the most coincident results.",

However, these methods are computationally expensive and not always straightforward on land datasets. In this paper, we first proved that the surface-based IME method, which is the most computationally efficient method among the three methods, can be derived from the CFP theory. Then we extend it to CMP domain under the assumption of locally lateral invariance of the earth, which makes it more computationally efficient. In addition, we proposed applying a time-variant taper based on the first Fresnel zone to predict the multiples more percisely. Besides, the improved S/N ratio and dense offset distribution can be obtained by using the CMP supergather, which makes the CMP-oriented method more suitable for land data. Some practical processing strategies are proposed via case study. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with the application to synthetic and field data.",

    "abstract": "Eight selected geopotential models obtained through the International Center for Global Earth Models were used in the dynamic orbit determination process of the satellite of the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission. For the estimation of various GOCE orbital arc variants, the following gravity models were taken into account: HUST-GRACE2016S, ITU_GRACE16, ITSG-GRACE2014S, ITSG-GRACE2014K, TONGJI-GRACE01, EIGEN-51C, EIGEN5S, EGM2008. The official kinematic and reduced-dynamic precise science orbit (PSO) of the GOCE satellite received via the European Space Agency was adopted as the reference orbit. Cartesian coordinates of the GOCE satellite in this orbit were treated as pseudo-observations in the estimation process using the classical least-squares method. The estimated orbital arcs were fitted to the corresponding arcs of the reference orbit. This allowed the values of 3D root-mean-square (RMS) of the distance between the estimated and reference arcs to be computed. The averages for these 3D RMS values, computed for ten and fifty orbital arcs, made it possible to compare the orbital performance of selected gravity models. Additionally, the fit to both types of the GOCE PSO, i.e., the kinematic orbit and the reduced-dynamic orbit made it possible to compare their quality. Investigation of the gravity model performance was also the opportunity to describe the effectiveness of dynamic orbit determination solutions, depending on the estimated arc lengths, type of reference orbit and the use (or not) of the background models.",

    "abstract": "The neutron borehole probe equipped with a neutron source and a system of neutron detectors is commonly used to determine porosity of geological formations. Transport of neutrons through media relies on their interaction with atomic nuclei, mainly with the process of scattering and absorption. Curves recorded by detectors for a given geological layer bordered by a medium with other neutron properties form the so-called anomalies. The course of the anomaly mainly depends on neutron properties of the bordering media and also on the measurement geometry, borehole properties, etc. The paper focuses mainly on an influence of neutron properties of bordered rock media on the course of the anomaly curve, especially near the media boundaries. In some cases of bordering media, characterized by specific neutron properties, the course of anomalies can be significantly disturbed, forming specific artifacts. The paper explains that the presence of artifacts is closely related to the properties of bordered media for both fast and thermal neutrons, i.e., the slowing down length of fast neutrons and the absorption cross section of thermal neutrons. Artifacts can be the cause of misinterpretation of the neutron rock porosity probe measurement. All considerations presented in this paper are based on results obtained from MC calculations performed using MCNP5 code (MCNP Team in X-5 Monte Carlo Team, MCNP—a general Monte Carlo N-particle transport code version 5. Los Alamos National Laboratory LA-UR-03-1987, 2008).",

As a result of the measurement, the orientation of the main crack systems (NW–SE and NE–SW) responsible for the location of cliffs within the Skalni Potok Valley was obtained. In addition, the main crack directions for the gneiss occurring in the studied mountain region were identified. Interpretation of the ERT models allowed to characterise the structure of the rock mass, including the reach of the rainwater infiltration level and the depth of the weathering front.",

The modelling process relays on the calculation of the voltage decay in time domain formed from the induced magnetic field diffusing into the study medium, when a pulse current with a given frequency is flowing in a transmitting loop coil. The model results show that the power current of 1 A transmitted from the coils with 100 or 400 m of size is effective for localization of the Zn–Pb ore bodies. However, the resolution and penetration depth of the TEM with a coil of L = 100 m is better and shorter in comparison with those in the case using the coil L = 400 m.",

    "abstract": "Weighted mean temperature ( $$T_{m}$$ ) is used to determine water vapor content, precipitable water vapor, and integrated water vapor (IWV) in GNSS. This parameter is highly correlated with climate conditions as well as the type of the region. The case study is performed in Iran which has diverse climate. ERA5 reanalysis datasets were used at a compact grid of 0.125 × 0.125 between 2007 and the end of 2019 to model the $$T_{m}$$ . The data obtained from 12 radiosonde stations along with an IGS station located in Tehran were employed in this research. Five models were examined for $$T_{m}$$ . Bevis model, linear grouping model (LGM), and linear nearest grid point model (LNGPM) were considered as $$T_{m}$$ linear models, and harmonic model (HM) and GPT2w model were used as nonlinear models. In LGM method the study region was divided into smaller areas with different linear model coefficients using spatial grouping method. The local model in each radiosonde station was considered as a reference. According to the results, the accuracy of linear models (Bevis and LGM model) was between 3 and 8 K (radiosonde data as reference); also 7 out of 12 stations in the LGM had higher accuracy than the Bevis model (based on RMSE). The accuracy of the two GPT2w models and the harmonic model was higher than the previous two models, and it was between 2 and 4 K. The IWV values were obtained using zenith total delay observations of IGS station located in Tehran using 5 models and were compared with the IWV values of the radiosonde station. The accuracy of the values in three linear models, Bevis, LGM, and LNGPM, was, respectively, 0.2, 0.17, and 0.14 kg m−2, and in the two nonlinear models, GPT2w and HM, was 0.13 kg m−2.",

Estimated parameters in extreme-value distributions can assist in interpreting the behaviour of the system. Using simulation, this study investigated how sample size influences the results of statistical tests and related interpretations. Commonly used estimation techniques (maximum likelihood and probability-weighted moments) were employed in a case study; the results were applied in judging time series of annual maximum river flow from two stations on the same river, but with different lengths of observation records. The results revealed that sample size is crucial for determining the existence of an upper bound.",

Turbulence based RANS equations are used here under turbulence closure assumptions. Depth-averaging the equations of continuity and momentum, yield two differential equations for the surface elevation and the average forward velocity. After nondimensionalization, the two equations are converted in terms of elevation over the inclined bed and the discharge, where the latter is a function of the former satisfying a first order differential equation, while the elevation is given by a first order evolution equation which is treated by Lax-Wendroff discretization. Starting initially with a single sinusoidal crest, it is shown that as time progresses, the crest leans forwards, causing a jump in the crest upfront resulting in its roll over as a jet. Three cases show that jump becomes more prominent with increasing bed inclination.",

However, there are two issues in applying this technique to a coalbed: strong azimuthal anisotropy resulting from high-density fractures, and the seismic response being composed of many or several individual reflections within the coalbed. To overcome these difficulties, we present an exact solution for reflections in extensive dilatancy anisotropy media. First, we build a three-layer model and simulate the wave propagation in this model. Then we derive an exact P- and converted S-wave reflection coefficient equation based on boundary conditions. Finally, substituting given model parameters into the exact equation, we obtain the variation in the reflection coefficient with incidence angle. The results show that the fracture factors, wavelet frequency and thickness of the coalbed have different effects on the reflection coefficient. Furthermore, we create a synthetic seismogram by forward calculation, and the result fits well with results of the exact equation.",

In this paper, the support vector classifier (SVC) is applied for this duty by using gravity data. It is shown that using SVC leads us to estimate the approximate shapes of gravity sources more objectively. The procedure of selecting correct features is called feature selection (FS). In this research, the proper features are selected using inter/intra class distance algorithm and also FS is optimized by increasing and decreasing the number of dimensions of features space. Then, by using the proper features, SVC is used to estimate approximate shapes of sources from the six possible shapes, including: sphere, horizontal cylinder, vertical cylinder, rectangular prism, syncline, and anticline. SVC is trained using 300 synthetic gravity profiles and tested by 60 other synthetic and some real gravity profiles (related to a well and two ore bodies), and shapes of their sources estimated properly.",

Numerical tests and practical applications demonstrate that improved Gabor deconvolution can further broaden frequency bandwidth with less computational expenses than the ordinary method. Moreover, we attempt to enlarge this method’s application value by addressing nonstationary and evaluating Q values. In fact, energy relationship of each hyperbolic bin (i.e., attenuation curve) can be taken as a quantitative indicator in balancing nonstationarity and conditioning seismic traces to the assumption of unchanging wavelet, which resultantly reveals more useful information for constrained reflectivity inversion. Meanwhile, a statistical method on Q-value estimation is also proposed by utilizing this linear model’s gradient. In practice, not only estimations well agree with geologic settings, but also applications on Q-compensation migration are favorable in characterizing deep geologic structures, such as the pinch-out boundary and water channel.",

    "abstract": "The Iranian Plateau does not appear to be a single crustal block, but an assemblage of zones comprising the Alborz—Azerbaijan, Zagros, Kopeh—Dagh, Makran, and Central and East Iran. The Gumbel's III asymptotic distribution method (GIII) and maximum magnitude expected by Kijko—Sellevoll method is applied in order to check the potentiality of the each seismogenic zone in the Iranian Plateau for the future occurrence of maximum magnitude (Mmax). For this purpose, a homogeneous and complete seismicity database of the instrumental period during 1900–2012 is used in 29 seismogenic zones of the examined region. The spatial mapping of hazard parameters (upper bound magnitude (ω), most probable earthquake magnitude in next 100 years (M100) and maximum magnitude expected by maximum magnitude estimated by Kijko—Sellevoll method (max MK − Smax) reveals that Central and East Iran, Alborz and Azerbaijan, Kopeh—Dagh and SE Zagros are a dangerous place for the next occurrence of a large earthquake.",

For aftershock sequences following the Modified Omori's Formula (MOF) it seems clear that the inter-event distribution is a power law. The parameters of this law are defined and they prove to be higher than the calculated value (2–1/p). Based on the analysis of the catalogs, it is determined that the probability densities of the inter-event time distribution collapse into a single master curve when the data is rescaled with instantaneous intensity, R(t; M th ), defined by MOF. The curve is approximated by a gamma distribution. The collapse of the data provides a clear view of aftershock-occurrence self-similarity.",

MASW surveys were carried out in two limestone quarries in the southern part of Poland. The experimental areas are characterised by a simple geological structure: consolidated Triassic limestone. Measurement profiles were arranged as a shapely six-pointed star. For each survey line, 12 geophones with 2-meter (Deposit 1) and 3-meter (Deposit 2) spacing were applied. The research allowed to compare P- and S-wave velocity changes with the main crack systems in the studied rock masses.",

Calculations showed that during the MS there took place an increase, by modulus, of the values of vertical component of transfer velocity, due to ambipolar diffusion, up to a factor of 1.4–2.1. During the MS there took place a decrease of the values of energy input to the electron gas by about 20–35%. During the main phase of MS, the heat flux density transferred by electrons increased up to a factor of 2–2.5. Results of estimates of the zonal component electric field value Ey are presented. During the MS the value of Ey was −9.5 mV/m. The vertical component of plasma velocity due to electromagnetic drift vEB has been calculated.",

Different sets of pseudo-range simulations along reference GOCE satellite orbital arcs were obtained using real orbits of the Global Positioning System satellites. These sets were the basic observation data used in the adjustment. The centimeter-accuracy Precise Science Orbit (PSO) for the GOCE satellite provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was adopted as the GOCE reference orbit. Comparing various variants of the orbital solutions, the relative accuracy of geopotential models in an orbital aspect is determined. Full geopotential models were used in the adjustment process. The solutions were also determined taking into account truncated geopotential models. In such case, an accuracy of the solutions was slightly enhanced. Different arc lengths were taken for the computation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present work addresses the problem of unified methodology use for vibration analysis caused by various anthropogenic sources. The experimental part of the paper contains analysis and results comparison of the vibration, induced by freight train passages and hammer percussion. Ground vibrations are important for the civil engineering objects condition since the vibration induced by train is transmitted through the ground to the foundation and structure. Ground vibration can also be a source of disturbance for the residents. However, various factors cause vibration that varies in both intensity and frequency measures. The analysis of vibration timelines, running RMS and Fourier spectra are applied. The major part of the dissertation is the analysis of RMS accelerations and velocities in one-third octave frequency bands in 1 to 80 Hz spectrum, and comparison to the background vibration noise, recorded in the same localisation. The different values of time-window observation are applied to analyse the results. The results of long lasting cargo-induced vibrations are less dependent on time-window duration than the results of impulse-induced vibrations. The acceleration and velocity analysis results are compared to the literature data concerning the ground vibration caused by railway transport and mining activity. The paper indicates the possibility to apply unified methodology for vibration analysis caused by both long-lasting sources, as trains and short-lasting ones, as industrial blasts or mine tremors. The results indicate an optimal time window for vibration measurement that would enable to automate vibration monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The structural complexities of hydrocarbon reservoirs make it difficult to correlate geological and petrophysical properties. A successful field development depends on accurately mapping the spatial distributions of reservoir key parameters. In this study, we present results on rock type analysis, estimation, and uncertainty evaluation of geological and petrophysical data of 33 wells in one of the south Iranian gas fields. This paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we used a reservoir rock classification theme based on identifying electrofacies (EFs) and hydraulic flow units by analyzing both log and core data. In the second part of the paper, we performed estimation, uncertainty evaluation, and assessment of the porosity–thickness relationship of the high-quality EFs using geostatistical techniques. We used sequential simulation schemes to map the spatial distributions of porosity and thickness of the high-quality EFs across the field. Using probabilistic approaches, the generated multiple realizations were used to quantify the local and spatial uncertainties. Variogram analysis showed that property distributions had a higher continuity and minimum variance in the NW–SE direction. Based on spatial uncertainty analysis, we found that the indicator-based sequential simulated maps exhibited less spatial uncertainty. Furthermore, the obtained probability maps indicated that the SE part of the study area is more suitable for drilling and production scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents the results of an integrated interpretation of measurements made using Audio-Magnetotellurics and Seismic Reflection geophysical methods. The obtained results were used to build an integrated geophysical model of shallow subsurface cover consisting of Cenozoic deposits, which then formed the basis for a detailed lithological and tectonic interpretation of deeper Mesozoic sediments. Such shallow covers, consisting mainly of glacial Pleistocene deposits, are typical for central and northern Poland. This investigation concentrated on delineating the accurate geometry of Obrzycko Cenozoic graben structure filled with loose deposits, as it was of great importance to the acquisition, processing and interpretation of seismic data that was to reveal the tectonic structure of the Cretaceous and Jurassic sediments which underly the study area. Previously, some problems with estimation of seismic static corrections over similar grabens filled with more recent, low-velocity deposits were encountered. Therefore, a novel approach to estimating the exact thickness of such shallow cover consisting of low-velocity deposits was applied in the presented investigation. The study shows that some alternative geophysical data sets (such as magnetotellurics) can be used to significantly improve the imaging of geological structure in areas where seismic data are very distorted or too noisy to be used alone",

    "abstract": "Abstract A set of four magnitude Ml ≥ 3.0 earthquakes including the magnitude Ml = 3.7 mainshock of the seismic sequence hitting the Lake Constance, Southern Germany, area in July–August 2019 was studied by means of bulletin and waveform data collected from 86 seismic stations of the Central Europe-Alpine region. The first single-event locations obtained using a uniform 1-D velocity model, and both fixed and free depths, showed residuals of the order of up ± 2.0 s, systematically affecting stations located in different areas of the study region. Namely, German stations to the northeast of the epicenters and French stations to the west exhibit negative residuals, while Italian stations located to the southeast are characterized by similarly large positive residuals. As a consequence, the epicentral coordinates were affected by a significant bias of the order of 4–5 km to the NNE. The locations were repeated applying a method that uses different velocity models for three groups of stations situated in different geological environments, obtaining more accurate locations. Moreover, the application of two methods of relative locations and joint hypocentral determination, without improving the absolute location of the master event, has shown that the sources of the four considered events are separated by distances of the order of one km both in horizontal coordinates and in depths. A particular attention has been paid to the geographical positions of the seismic stations used in the locations and their relationship with the known crustal features, such as the Moho depth and velocity anomalies in the studied region. Significant correlations between the observed travel time residuals and the crustal structure were obtained.",

The smart SHEER database harmonizes data from different fields (geophysical, geochemical, geological, technological, etc.), creates and provides access to an advanced database of case studies of environmental impact indicators associated with shale gas exploitation and exploration, which previously did not exist. A unique component of the SHEER database comes from the monitoring activity performed during the project in one active shale gas exploration and exploitation site at Wysin, Poland, which started from the pre-operational phase. The SHEER database is capable of the adoption of new data such as results of other Work Packages and has developed an over-arching structure for higher-level integration.",

    "abstract": "The tectonic settings investigated by several seismic projects in previous research targeting the structure in Central Poland mainly focused on the Earth’s crust. In this paper, we present P-wave velocity verification in the uppermost mantle beneath LUMP profile towards SSE-NNW. Using recordings of 36 DATA-CUBE recorders from ca. 300–490 km far earthquake in coal mine “Janina” in southern Poland, we calculated travel times to verify P-wave velocity below the Moho boundary from previous studies. It shows that a significantly lower mean velocity value should be used for the upper mantle while counting these offsets of travel times in the SSE-NNW direction than that used on previous profiles. We present two possible models: first, the most simple one that fits the observed first arrivals, and the second with a low-velocity layer beneath the Moho boundary. In both cases, we used a priori crustal model focusing only on P-wave velocity in the uppermost mantle. Both of them significantly improved adjustment of travel times to the observed data. To evaluate the tendency of adopting too high velocities beneath the Moho, we used also 11 broadband stations, Reftek 151-121 “Observer”, from “13 BB Star” passive experiment and 6 STS-2 seismometers from permanent stations of the Polish Seismological Network (PLSN).",

These models are focused on deciphering the tectonic structures at the contact of the Inner Carpathians with the European Platform in this area. For the Inner Carpathian block, we propose the term Carpathia. Profile SA-01 shows shallower structures and the parallel MT-05 profile shows deeper structures. These models are also correlated with the seismic profile CEL-05. All results are compatible and show an original subduction-collisional structure, which was later replaced by a transpressive-transtensional one. The most striking structures are thick highly conductive subhorizontal zones in the middle crust and a tectonically controlled deep vertical conductive structure—the Carpathian conductive zone. Other significant structures, which also appear in the seismic section, are back thrusting of Flysch Belt and the Klippen Belt basement (Penninic crust) uplift.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Full waveform inversion (FWI) has proved to be a reliable tool for high-resolution imaging of lithospheric structures at various depths down to the upper mantle. However, when the size of the model is large, the computational burden is significative and applications are restricted to low frequencies. To tackle this issue, we developed a new 2D time-domain hybrid method to simulate high-frequency teleseismic body waves propagating through a local heterogeneous elastic Earth model: The frequency-wavenumber (FK) integration method is coupled with the staggered grid finite difference method (SGFD). The FK method is used to compute the wavefield due to obliquely incident plane P and SV waves in a 1D multilayered half space that excites a local heterogeneous region. Inside this region, the velocity-stress staggered grid FD method (SGFD) is used to accurately deal with wave propagation in heterogeneous media. Spurious waves that might be generated at the boundaries of the local region are avoided using convolutional perfectly matched layers (CPML). This new hybrid method inherits the low-memory requirements of the FK method and the accuracy, efficiency and easy implementation of the SGFD. The new hybrid method is benchmarked against the analytical FK method for some canonical models and shows good agreement with analytical solutions. Subsequently, our modeling tool is incorporated into a full waveform inversion algorithm adapted for teleseismic configurations to invert the incident P wave and its coda. The inversion is carried out using a gradient approach that is efficiently implemented via the adjoint-state method. The results suggest that our hybrid method and FWI algorithm represent a valuable tool for 2D forward and inverse regional applications using teleseismic data sets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Global Association model is a crucial tool in seismic data analysis at the International Data Centre (IDC) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. However, it faces challenges due to its limitations in accurately associating seismic events on a global scale. Over the past years, attempts have been undertaken to tackle these issues by introducing the Network Processing Vertically Integrated Seismic Analysis (NET-VISA) algorithm, specifically designed to enhance seismic event association across the globe. NET-VISA uses a machine learning Bayesian approach to solve the automatic association problem. NET-VISA has been implemented in operation as an additional automatic event scanner tool since January 2018. In this study, we assess the effect of the NET-VISA automatic scanner on the IDC output REB and LEB bulletins. We used three distinct time periods to evaluate the NET-VISA performance. The results show a 4.6% increase in the number of LEB events after including the NET-VISA scanner in operation, with an average of 7 additional events per day, and an increase of 17.90% in the number of scanned events. A comparison between the different bulletins in distinct periods shows NET-VISA is beneficial to build more valid events, providing opportunities to improve nuclear-test-ban monitoring. However, NET-VISA exhibits slightly reduced performance for events occurring at depths exceeding 300 km.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a novel geophysical approach for estimating the level of thermal maturity (LOM) in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs using well log data. LOM is a crucial parameter for assessing the hydrocarbon generation potential of source rocks, but it traditionally relies on laboratory measurements of core samples, which can be time-consuming and costly. The proposed method combines two techniques: interval inversion for estimating total organic carbon (TOC) content from well logs and simulated annealing (SA) optimization for deriving LOM from the estimated TOC. The interval inversion method enables accurate TOC estimation by jointly interpreting multiple well logs over depth intervals, overcoming limitations of conventional point-by-point inversion. Using the estimated TOC, the SA algorithm optimizes an energy function related to Passey's empirical TOC-LOM relationship, iteratively finding the optimal LOM value that best fits the well log data. This approach provides a continuous in situ LOM profile along the borehole without requiring core measurements. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies on datasets from the North Sea (Norway), the Pannonian Basin (Hungary), and the Kingak Formation (Alaska). The LOM estimates show good agreement with reported maturity levels and allow reliable reservoir characterization. Statistical analysis confirms the robustness and accuracy of the results. By reducing dependence on core data, this integrated inversion-optimization workflow streamlines the reservoir prospecting phase, enhancing operational efficiency. The method holds promising applications across diverse geological settings for cost-effective evaluation of unconventional hydrocarbon plays.",

Depending on the extraction parameters, such as injection pressure and volume, the induced seismicity is time-dependent. We investigate the case of the two geothermal power plants of Insheim and Landau, which are located in the Upper Rhine Graben in Southwest Germany. The induced seismicity was observed by a local seismic network consisting of a total of 19 stations, resulting in an earthquake catalog comprising 930 events for the Landau reservoir and 1985 events for the Insheim reservoir, both between 2012 and 2022. Based on this earthquake catalog, seismic source areas are defined for both reservoirs, and a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) is performed. Using temporal subsets of the earthquake catalog, PSHA can also be performed for shorter time ranges, resulting in larger expected PGV values in times of higher induced seismicity. The seismic velocity profiles obtained by site effect studies based on ambient seismic noise measurements highlight relatively large variations of the site effects on short scales in the area. The consequences of these lateral variations on the seismic hazard assessment are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, the Precise Science Orbit (PSO) of the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer Mission (GOCE) satellite, acquired via the European Space Agency, served as the reference orbit for the testing various variants of the GOCE satellite orbit modeling. The GOCE satellite positions along the reduced-dynamic PSO orbit were treated as pseudo-observations in the satellite orbit improvement process in the least squares sense. This process was realized using dedicated extended Toruń Orbit Processor software which enabled determining corrections to the orbital initial conditions and the set of parameters, necessary to determine additional empirical accelerations of the satellite in the radial-track, along-track and cross-track directions. These piecewise accelerations were determined in successive equal intervals (pieces) into which the processed orbital arcs were divided. For modeling the accelerations, polynomials of different degrees were used. The obtained RMS differences between the improved orbits and the reference PSO orbit were determined for various orbital arc lengths up to 1-day. The best RMS of the fits for the 1-day arcs was in the range from 2.0 to 3.2 mm with significantly worst results for along-track direction. Based on the set of solutions determined, the number of orbital parameters for adopted accuracy thresholds and the upper limit of their number, that can be estimated depending on the length of the orbital arc, under given numerical conditions were obtained. The optimal form of the polynomial modeling of the estimated accelerations also depends partly on the length of the processed orbital arc. For shorter arcs (45 min and less), the second- third- and fourth-order polynomial gives the best results, while for longer arcs (90, 180, 360, 720 and 1440 min), zero- and first-degree polynomials are the most effective. A very promising solution with the RMS of the fit of 0.1 mm for a 1-min arc using the fourth-order polynomial was obtained in a perspective of the future use of the short arc approach to the fit of 1-day arcs. Additionally, solution variants with non-equal numbers of orbital pieces for the radial-along-and cross-track directions were obtained. In the case of the solution for an arc length of 1-day, the distribution of residuals and their statistics in the aforementioned radial-, along-and cross-track directions are presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conditions of the formation of key elements of the water balance, such as precipitation and runoff, and relations between them in the mountain catchment area are very complicated, conditioned both by the climatic factor and the physiographic characteristics of the catchment area. The aim of the study is to determine relations between precipitation and runoff in the Kłodzka Valley (KV) located in mountain areas of south-western Poland. Analyzes were based on precipitation in KV and discharges of the Nysa Kłodzka River and its tributaries, recorded in hydrological years 1974–2013. The bivariate Archimedean copulas were used to describe the degree of synchronicity between these variables. The study area shows a considerable variability in the conditions of transformation of precipitation into runoff. It is conditioned both by the pluvial regime and the physical-geographical characteristics of the catchment area. As a result, sub-catchments with diversified hydrological activity and their role in the formation of water resources of the entire KV were identified. Among them, the Biała Lądecka River sub-catchment was found to be the most hydrologically active, and the sub-catchment of Bystrzyca Dusznicka River the most inert, despite e.g. quite similar synchronicity of precipitation compared to the average precipitation in KV. At the same time, the KV rivers are characterized by different types of runoff regime and characteristic of the water balance structure. The methodology presented can be useful in determining dependencies between selected elements of the water balance and evaluation of water resources availability in source areas of mountain rivers.",

The pipe makes as an obstacle for ultrasonic waves. In order to resolve this task, we need to determine the thickness of the pipe and choose the appropriate resonant ultrasonic wave. Determination of the thickness of the industrial steel pipes was carried out using the resonant frequency of reflected ultrasound waves and the relationship coefficients. The thicknesses of the industrial pipes measured by the resonant ultrasound wave method are in good agreement with those measured using an electronic caliper. Measurements of the cavern geometry with presence of the operation pipe using the resonant frequency of ultrasonic wave were well verified in a physical model and will be able in application to determine the real salt caverns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Euler deconvolution is a widely used automatic or semi-automatic method for potential field data. However, it yields many spurious solutions that complicate interpretation and must be reduced, eliminated, recognized, or ignored during interpretation. This study proposes a post-processing algorithm that converts Euler solutions produced by tensor Euler deconvolution of gravity data with an unprescribed structural index into probability values ( p values) using the B-spline series density estimation (BSS) method. The p values of the Euler solution set form a probability density distribution on the estimation grid. The BSS method relies on the fact that while spurious solutions are sparse and ubiquitous, Euler deconvolution yields many similar or duplicate solutions, which may tightly cluster near real sources. The p values of the Euler solution clusters form multi-layered isosurfaces that can be used to discriminate neighboring target sources because the p values of spurious solutions are vanishingly small, making it simple to remove their interference from the probability density distribution. In all synthetic cases, the geometric outlines of anomaly sources are estimated from probability density isosurfaces approximating synthetic model parameters. The BSS method was then applied to airborne gravity data from Mount Milligan, British Columbia, Canada. Subsequently, results from synthetic models and field data show that the proposed method can successfully localize meaningful geological targets.",

When it went online, following a significant improvement of the seismic acquisition system of INGV, it was including only data since the second fortnight of April 2005. About ten years later, the data since the beginning of 1985 suddenly appeared without any prior notice than the updating of the starting date of the dataset. However, the characteristics of the added data appeared clearly different from the following period both in terms of the numbers of located earthquakes and of types of magnitudes provided. After having analyzed the numerical consistency and the calibration of magnitudes of ISIDe as a function of time from 1985 to 15 April 2005, we can say that such a dataset is incomplete and poorly calibrated compared to other catalogs of Italian seismicity (CSTI, CSI, and HORUS) available for the same period. Hence, we suggest not using it as is for statistical analyses of Italian seismicity. However, it provides some magnitudes that are missed by other catalogs and thus might be used for improving such catalogs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Applying advanced signal analysis and feature extraction methods to seismic datasets facilitates the extraction of key information from these valuable resources. In particular, advanced deep learning models can play a crucial role in this extraction process from seismic waveforms. This study aims to analyze the seismicity of the Cameroon area by deeply scanning an archived dataset from a temporary seismic network composed of 32 broadband sensors that operated in Cameroon from March 2005 to February 2007. We thoroughly scan the dataset to detect local earthquakes, calculate an updated crustal velocity model for the region by incorporating the acquired earthquake bulletin, and perform a joint inversion scheme. The DL-based workflow implemented in this study utilizes a pair-input deep learning model for scanning the seismic phases in the dataset, followed by a seismic phase picking process. Applying the Rapid Earthquake Association and Location method allows for the association of detected phases with local seismic events. By combining a set of 17,261 P-picked and 14,239 S-picked phases associated with 473 well-located earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from $$1.3 \\le M_L \\le 4.6$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>1.3</mml:mn> <mml:mo>≤</mml:mo> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>M</mml:mi> <mml:mi>L</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>≤</mml:mo> <mml:mn>4.6</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> , we implement a joint inversion to estimate an updated 1D crustal velocity model and hypocentral parameters. The obtained model reveals layers with thicknesses of 82,034, and 54 km, extending to a depth of 80 km, with P-wave velocities ( $$V_{{\\text{p}}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>p</mml:mtext> </mml:msub> </mml:math> ) of 6.1, 6.4, 6.6, 7.6, 8.25, and 8.5 km/s, and S-wave velocities ( $$V_{{\\text{s}}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext> </mml:msub> </mml:math> ) of 3.57, 3.74, 3.86, 4.44, 4.82, and 5.0 km/s, respectively. The newly detected seismic events predominantly cluster in the Central Cameroon Shear Zone (CCSZ), the east flank of Mount Cameroon, the region between Mount Cameroon and Bioko Island, and the southern part of Bioko Island. The validity of this approach is further supported by a newly compiled catalog for this period, which is 1.35 times more extensive than the previously reported catalog for this dataset. Finally, the study presents a 3D time-lapse animation illustrating the sequence of detected earthquakes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Poland is characterised by weak natural seismicity. However, the last analysis of the natural seismic hazard in the country was carried out 24 years ago. Therefore, a significant fraction of the recorded seismicity is not included in the hazard estimates currently used, either because recent observations are not taken into account or because of improved seismic network capabilities. Furthermore, Podhale, in the Tatra Mountains, is the only region with recorded permanent natural seismicity. This study aims to create new seismic hazard maps of the Podhale region from a newly compiled database containing information on historical events and two complete instrumental catalogues (regional and local), each at a different level of completeness. The local catalogue was recorded over the last few years. Two seismic hazard assessment techniques were applied, namely the conventional (zone-based) (Cornell in Bull Seismol Soc Am 58(5): 1583–1606, 1968) and the smoothed seismicity model, based on the spatial distribution of seismicity. The earthquake recurrence parameters were estimated using the methodology developed by Kijko et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 106: 1210–1222, 2016). The new seismic hazard model incorporates several improvements, such as a comprehensive logic tree and a new set of ground motion models. The new maps provide a more detailed assessment of the seismic hazards of the investigated area. Moreover, they predict higher PGA than previous seismic hazard maps covering Podhale, like global European Seismic Hazard Maps 2013 and 2020.",

The aim was to investigate primarily the bias current stability and the noise level of the instrument (for measured components less than 10 pT in a root-mean-square sense). A brief description of the measurement principles and a review of formulae used for field component calculations are given. The errors of components, which arise from assumptions on dIdD orientation as well as from the total field time variations during a measurement cycle, are estimated and discussed, both for real and simulated data. Finally, the accuracy of the instrument was estimated, and the maximal theoretical accuracies of components were better than 60 pT at mid-latitudes.",

The registered variations at three Croatian repeat stations were compared to the variations estimated by the SECS method using the variations from the different sets of observatories. The results of the SECS method were also compared to a simple assumption that the variations at repeat station are equal to those at particular observatory. The relevance of this comparison was to get an insight about the possibility of using the SECS method for estimating the geomagnetic field variations over Croatia. The guidelines for the application of the SECS method for the purpose of reducing repeat station data were also given.",

The main aim in this survey is the simulation of the muon radiography for exploration of mines. So, the production source, tracking, and detection of cosmic ray muons were simulated by MCNPX code. For this purpose, the input data of the source card in MCNPX code were extracted from the muon energy spectrum at sea level. In addition, the other input data such as average density and thickness of layers that were used in this code are the measured data from Pabdana (Kerman, Iran) coal mines. The average thickness and density of these layers in the coal mines are from 2 to 4 m and 1.3 gr/c3, respectively. To increase the spatial resolution, a detector was placed inside the mountain. The results indicated that using this approach, the layers with minimum thickness about 2.5 m can be identified.",

High intensities of gamma-rays were detected around these gradients. In addition, higher hot spring temperatures and flow rates can be observed in this area. These results indicate that some part of the level of the basement where the hot springs are concentrated is a part of the Kego Fault and is similar to the fracture zone created by past activities of the fault. Moreover, these steep depth gradients act as a path for hot spring water from the deeper side of the granitic body to the surface.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study analyzes the relationships between the stress changes produced by the water load variations due to the filling operations at the Pirrís Reservoir, Costa Rica, and the stress changes generated by three relevant earthquakes after the first impoundment. The earthquakes differ in their magnitude, distance from reservoir and depth. Two of them correspond to a shallow crustal faulting, and the third earthquake corresponds to a subduction thrust-fault. The first filling operations began in March 2011 and the daily time history of water levels was available until December 2017. The seismicity has been recorded by a dense local network of seismological stations operating since January 2008. Effects of both types of sources (water loads and earthquakes) were combined to obtain the total Coulomb Failure Stress in the reservoir area, analyzing which of them was dominant in each case and time. We then analyzed the effects of the pore pressure diffusion due to the water loads on the nearby seismicity including two of the studied earthquakes. Results lead to different conclusions depending on the characteristics of each earthquake. An important result is observed after the occurrence of the subduction earthquake, where the coseismic effects become dominant along the entire study area, eclipsing the effect of water loading at all depths. This shows that in a regime stressed by a regional earthquake, albeit of its moderate magnitude, and regional distance, the effect of water loads is barely perceptible. In the absence of tectonic activity, however, the impact of water loading is notable.",

Eight of them are from the gothic period. The Thellier–Thellier archaeointensity protocol was used in order to determine the ancient intensity and inclination registered by the bricks. In total, 28 representative specimens from 16 bricks gave successful archaeointensity determination with category B of results quality. For 25 of them the corrections for anisotropy of thermoremanent magnetization and cooling rate were introduced. A large number of specimens classified as category C (48%) is due to a high value of relative additivity check error d(AC) caused most probably by the presence of multi-domain magnetite. The curvature parameter k exceeds the limit value in 11 specimens. However, in the same sample specimens with k higher than 0.270 have provided very similar values of archaeointensity than those with k below this limit. Corrected data are convergent with the Central European master curve of archaeointensity. The corrections of raw data reduce their dispersion at specimen/sample level in most of sites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of the study was to investigate if aviation emissions could influence the climate and weather by modifying the chemical composition of the atmosphere and subsequently, the radiative balance. To carry out the set objective, we used the global environmental multiscale atmospheric chemistry model with comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry that is interactive with the radiation calculations. The model was run for two current climate scenarios, with and without aviation emissions. The results of the study indicate that the most significant difference in the jet stream propagation occurred during the winter season, and the smallest was observed during summer. Changes in the jet stream propagation vary by season and region. During the colder time of the year, the eddy-driven jet stream tends to shift poleward, while during the spring season the equatorward shift was observed in a scenario with aviation emissions. Analysis of regional changes shows that the most noticeable differences occurred over the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Asia. The changes over the oceans changed the occurrence of the North Pacific and Bermuda–Azores Highs. Over Asia (Siberia), a stronger and more poleward drift of the eddy-driven jet stream was observed in a scenario without aviation emission. Dissimilarity in the jet stream velocity was found only during the winter seasons when in a scenario with aviation emission, the jet stream velocity was 10 m/s smaller as compared to the scenario without aviation emission.",

Increasing computing power enabled the implementation of ensemble prediction system forecasts in the operational mode and the use of a new computer for research purposes. As part of the priority project on “Study of Disturbances in the Representation of Modeling Uncertainty in Ensemble Development” and the earlier project entitled “COSMO Towards Ensemble in Km in Our Countries), implemented in the Working Group 7 (Predictability and Ensemble Methods) as part of the COSMO modeling consortium, specific studies were carried out to test ensemble forecasts. This research concerned the impact of variability of physical fields characterizing the soil surface (a selected parameter determining evaporation from the soil surface and soil surface temperature) using various methods of perturbation. Numerical experiments were completed for the warm period (from June to September) 2013.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On 11 March 2021, a quite short strong signal was recorded by seismic stations of the CICESE Seismic Network, which cannot be associated with any regional or global earthquake. At the CICESE Campus and all along the city of Ensenada, in Baja California, Mexico, people reported vibration of the windows and even a short strong rumbling. Fortunately, houses and buildings did not report any damage. Due to the interaction between the atmosphere and the shallow earth surface, this anomalous atmospheric activity produced a special seismological footprint, with frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz. In this manuscript, we report on the observations of a multiparameter dataset, including seismic data along with wind velocity, wind density, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and THSW index. The atmospheric perturbation wave was strong enough to be clearly recorded by seismic stations within an area of almost 80 km and to produce some changes in the recorded meteorological parameters. The results from an FK analysis show that the atmospheric activity occurred to the south of Ensenada City and travelled to the north, as shown in the seismic records. We discuss the characteristics of the seismic signals in the frequency domain and the relation to the changes in the atmospheric parameters that could be related to this anomalous atmospheric activity.",

Thermal properties include not only thermal conductivity but also heat production and heat capacity. A full range of dataset and analysis out of it is presented here. The target of this study is to deliver new insights in the thermal properties of volcanic rocks of Austria. The focus is laid on thermal conductivity—understanding of influencing factors and correlations with other properties, like compressional wave velocity, electrical resistivity or radiogenic heat production. Therefore, a set of data from various volcanic rocks of Austria is presented, analysed in detail and new correlations are presented. The correlations can be further applied on logging data to derive thermal properties in the field. These improved correlations and further interpretations can help in planning geothermal projects and can improve the output of simulations because of the better input data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Qualitative interpretation is one of the most important missions in geophysical methods, particularly the determination of the shape and depth of disturbing bodies. The characteristics of the gravity field make it difficult to unequivocally determine both of these parameters; therefore, the problem is solved by reducing the shape of the body by means of simple solid figures and on this basis an attempt to estimate their depth. This paper presents an analysis of depth estimation in microgravity surveys. The useful signal-to-error ratio in this survey causes an additional factor influencing the quality of the estimated depths. Werner deconvolution and Extended Euler deconvolution, as the most frequently applied methods, were used to resolving the problem. Based on the Werner method, a processing methodology was developed that minimizes the impact of the error on the calculation results. An algorithm was also created that allows obtaining a depth solution in this method. The results of the Werner method were compared with the results of the Extended Euler method. Tests have shown that despite the relatively high error to amplitude ratio of the anomaly, satisfactory results can be obtained with the appropriate methodology.",
