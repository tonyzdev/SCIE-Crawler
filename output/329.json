    "abstract": "The primary objective of this publication is to provide an overview of the species identity, invasion status, geographical extent, and abundance of alien plants in South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, based on field records from 1979 to the end of 2000. The dataset is all the species records for the study area in the Southern African Plant Invaders Atlas (SAPIA) database during this time period. A total of 548 naturalized and casual alien plant species were catalogued and invasion was recorded almost throughout the study area. Most invasion, in terms of both species numbers and total species abundance, was recorded along the southern, southwestern and eastern coastal belts and in the adjacent interior. This area includes the whole of the Fynbos and Forest Biomes, and the moister eastern parts of the Grassland and Savanna Biomes. This study reinforces previous studies that the Fynbos Biome is the most extensively invaded vegetation type in South Africa but it also shows that parts of Savanna and Grassland are as heavily invaded as parts of the Fynbos. The Fabaceae is prominent in all biomes and Acacia with 17 listed species, accounts for a very large proportion of all invasion. Acacia mearmii was by far the most prominent invasive species in the study area, followed by A. saligna, Lantana camara, A. cyclops, Opuntia ficus-indica. Solarium mauritianum, Populus alba/xcanescens, Melia azedarach, A. dealbata and species of Prosopis.",

    "abstract": "Background: This paper reviewed the benefits and negative impacts of alien species that are currently listed in the Alien and Invasive Species Regulations of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act no 10 of 2004) and certain alien species that are not yet listed in the regulations for which conflicts of interest complicate management. Objectives: Specifically, it identified conflict-generating species, evaluated the causes and driving forces of these conflicts and assessed how the conflicts have affected management. Method: A simple scoring system was used to classify the alien species according to their relative degree of benefits and negative impacts. Conflict-generating species were then identified and further evaluated using an integrated cognitive hierarchy theory and risk perception framework to identify the value systems (intrinsic and economic) and risk perceptions associated with each conflict. Results: A total of 552 alien species were assessed. Most of the species were classified as inconsequential (55%) or destructive (29%). Beneficial (10%) and conflict-generating (6%) species made a minor contribution. The majority (46%) of the conflict cases were associated with more than one value system or both values and risk perception. The other conflicts cases were based on intrinsic (40%) and utilitarian (14%) value systems. Conclusions: Conflicts based on value and risk perceptions are inherently difficult to resolve because authorities need to balance the needs of different stakeholders while meeting the mandate of conserving the environment, ecosystem services and human well-being. This paper uses the identified conflict-generating species to highlight the challenges and trade-offs of managing invasive species in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Background: Data on alien species status and occurrence are essential variables for the monitoring and reporting of biological invasions. The Southern African Plant Invaders Atlas (SAPIA) Project has, over the past 23 years, atlassed alien plants growing outside of cultivation. Objectives: To document changes in the alien plant taxa recorded in SAPIA, assess trends in invasive distributions and explore effects of management and regulations.Method: The numbers of alien plant taxa recorded were compared between May 2006 and May 2016, and changes in the extent of invasions at a quarter-degree squares (qds) scale were compared between 2000 and 2016. The effectiveness of regulations and interventions was assessed in terms of the relative change in the extent of invasions. Results: As of May 2016, SAPIA had records for 773 alien plant taxa, an increase of 172 since 2006. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of qds occupied by alien plants increased by ~50%, due both to ongoing sampling and to spread. Successful classical biological control programmes have reduced the rate of spread of some taxa and in a few cases have led to range contractions. However, other interventions had no detectable effect at a qds scale. Conclusions: South Africa has a growing number of invasive alien plant species across an increasing area. More taxa should be listed under national regulations, but ultimately more needs to be done to ensure that management is strategic and effective. SAPIA is a valuable tool for monitoring alien plant status and should be developed further so that invasions can be accurately tracked over time.",

Dicoma anomala (used mainly for digestive ailments) and Artemisia afra (used mainly for respiratory ailments) appear to be the best known and most widely used medicinal plants amongst a total of 37 species that have been cited four or more times in the literature.

    "abstract": "Background: Biological control of invasive alien plants (IAPs) using introduced natural enemies contributes significantly to sustained, cost-effective management of natural resources in South Africa. The status of, and prospects for, biological control is therefore integral to National Status Reports (NSRs) on Biological Invasions, the first of which is due in 2017. Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the status of, and prospects for, biological control of IAPs in South Africa. We discuss expansion of biological control and suggest indicators to be used in the upcoming NSR to assess sufficient growth. Method: We used published literature, unpublished work and personal communication to assess the status of biological control of IAPs. We propose indicators based on the targets for biological control that were proposed in the 2014 ‘National Strategy for dealing with biological invasions in South Africa’. To prioritise targets for future efforts, we used published lists of damaging IAPs and assessed the prospects for their biological control. Recommendations for using biological control as a management tool were made after discussion among the authors and with colleagues. Results: Significant control of several Cactaceae, Australian Acacia species and floating aquatic plants, and many other IAPs has been achieved in South Africa since 1913. Recently, biological control has benefited from improved international collaboration, a streamlined application process for the release of new biological control agents (resulting in the approval of 19 agents against 13 IAP species since 2013), and increased funding and capacity. There is still a need to improve implementation and to better integrate biological control with other control methods. In order to maximise benefits from biological control, increased investment is required, particularly in implementation and post-release evaluation, and in targeting new IAPs. Proposed targets for growth between 2017 and 2020 include an increase in financial investment in research by 29%, implementation by 28% and mass-rearing by 68%. Research capacity should increase by 29%, implementation capacity by 63% and mass-rearing capacity by 61%. New research projects should be initiated on 12 new IAP targets, while post-release monitoring efforts should be expanded to another 31 IAPs. Conclusion: Biological control of IAPs has contributed substantially to their management in South Africa, and continues to do so. Further investment in targeted aspects of IAP biological control will increase this contribution.",

    "abstract": "Background: Globally, invasive amphibians are known for their environmental and social impacts that range from poisoning of local fauna and human populations to direct predation on other amphibians. Although several countries on most continents have had multiple introductions of many species, southern Africa appears to have escaped allochthonous introductions. Instead, it has a small number of domestic exotic species that have rapidly expanded their ranges and established invasive populations within South Africa. Objectives methods: We used the literature to provide a historical overview of dispersal by some of the world’s major invasive amphibians, give examples of species that are commonly moved as stowaways and discuss historical and current amphibian trade in the region. In addition, we give an overview of new South African legislation and how this is applied to amphibian invasions, as well as providing updates on the introduced populations of three domestic exotics: Hyperolius marmoratus, Sclerophrys gutturalis and Xenopus laevis. Results: We show that frogs are mainly moved around southern Africa through ‘jump’ dispersal, although there are a number of records of ‘cultivation’, ‘leading-edge’ and ‘extreme long-distance’ dispersal types. Important pathways include trade in fruit and vegetables, horticultural products and shipping containers. Conclusion: We suggest that southern Africa is becoming more vulnerable to amphibian invasions because of an increase in trade, agricultural and domestic impoundments as well as global climate change. Increasing propagule pressure suggests that preventing new introductions will become a key challenge for the future. Currently, trade in amphibians in the region is practically non-existent, suggesting potential for best practice to prevent importation of species with high invasion potential and to stop the spread of disease.",

The National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2018 process provided an opportunity for a more comprehensive revision of the NVM and better alignment between the terrestrial, marine and estuarine ecosystem maps.Objectives: The aim of this study was to update the NVM 2018 and quantify spatial and classification changes since NVM 2012, and describe the rationale and data sources utilised. We also quantified spatial errors corrected in this version, highlighted progress since NVM 2006, and identified errors and gaps to make recommendations for future revisions.Method: Edits made to the NVM in ArcMap 10.4 were categorised into the following five groups for analysis: (1) New types, (2) Boundary edits, (3) Realm re-assignment, (4) Removed and replaced vegetation types and (5) Deleted map area. Changes were quantified by category and biome. We used various software platforms to correct and quantify spatial errors since 2006.Results: Vegetation types were added (n = 47), removed (n = 35) and had boundary edits (n = 107) in NVM 2018, which affected over 5% of the total map area, compared to 2.6% (2012) and 0.5% (2009) for previous versions. Several sources of error were identified and fixed, and prompted the development of standard mapping protocols.Conclusion: National Vegetation Map 2018 is the most substantial revision of this data set that now fully aligns with maps of all other realms that form part of the NBA. However, parts of the map remain unrefined and provide opportunities for future work.",

The transmission of herbal knowledge within various social groups is outlined. The background, training and some procedures followed by five of the informants are discussed. Plant characteristics that may be seen, felt, smelled or tasted are considered as possible determinants of usage. The form of plant parts accounts for some usage in the more magically orientated medicines whereas colour, texture or the production of froth may signal the presence of medicinally active components such as tannin, mucilage and saponin. The role of plants producing a milky latex is discussed. Vesicant or irritant properties are utilized in septic or inflammatory conditions. Aromatic plants are used for respiratory or digestive disorders and pungent-smelling plants are used in the treatment of catarrh and some stress-related disorders. Bitter or sour- tasting plants may be used as an aid to digestion or serve a deterrent function. Parallel usage of some related plants in African and European herbal practice indicates that appropriate usage may be widely determined by easily discerned plant characteristics. Two herbal medicinal recipes recorded by the author and a list of medicinal plants collected in Transkei are presented.",

    "abstract": "The stable isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon can potentially provide evidence of past climates. The most detailed information has been obtained from variations in the oxygen-18 content of foraminifera from ocean floor cores, the analysis of which has produced a record of ocean temperature changes through the Quaternary and beyond. The use of isotope analysis of continental materials to reveal climatic change is more limited, but some advances have been made in recent years. One approach has been to utilize the variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation as recorded in ancient groundwater. Thus groundwater samples from a confined aquifer on the southern Cape coast show a marked rise in temperature since the Last Glacial maximum. The temperature changes during the Upper Pleistocene and Holocene are also reflected in the oxygen-18 content of stalagmites from the Cango caves in the same region. The widespread occurrence of C4 grasses in the warmer summer rainfall areas of southern Africa provides a novel possibility of observing temporal shifts of climatic boundaries. The distinctly high carbon-13 content of C4 plants is clearly reflected in the skeletons of grazers so that faunal material from suitably situated archaeological sites can be used to observe changes in the composition of the local grass-cover. The evidence thus far accumulated suggests only minor changes since the Upper Pleistocene. The combined evidence to date indicates that temperatures and also precipitation in southern Africa have changed since the Last Glacial maximum, about 18 000 years ago, but that shifts in the boundaries of the various veld-types were probably not very extensive.",

    "abstract": "A survey of the mycorrhizal status of plants growing in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa was undertaken to assess the range of mycorrhizal types and their dominance in species characteristic of this region. Records were obtained by ex­amining the root systems of plants growing in three Cape lowland vegetation types, viz. West Coast Strandveld, West Coast Renosterveld and Sand Plain Lowland Fynbos for mycorrhizas, as well as by collating literature records of mycorrhizas on plants growing in the region. The mycorrhizal status of 332 species is listed, of which 251 species are new records. Members of all the important families in this region have been examined. Mycorrhizal status appears to be associated mainly with taxonomic position of the species. Extrapolating from these results, we conclude that 62% of the flora of the Cape Floristic Region form vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, 23% have no mycorrhizas, 8% are ericoid mycorrhizal, 2% form orchid mycorrhizas, whereas the mycorrhizal status of 4% of the flora is unknown. There were no indigenous ectomycor- rhizal species. The proportion of non-mycorrhizal species is high compared to other ecosystems. In particular, the lack of mycorrhizas in several important perennial families in the Cape Floristic Region is unusual. The diversity of nutrient acquir­ing adaptations, including the range of mycorrhizas and cluster roots in some non-mycorrhizal families, may promote co­existence of plants in this species-rich region.",

    "abstract": "Environmental data collected at 507 plots on 22 transects, and soil analytical data from 81 of these plots, have been used to describe the plant environments of the mountains in the Fynbos Biome. Two major regional gradients are recognized: a west-east gradient and a coast-interior gradient. Of particular consequence for fynbos-environment studies is the increase in the proportion of fine soil particles from west to east. At least some aspects of soil fertility also increase towards the east. The edaphic changes are paralleled by climatic changes: chiefly a decrease in the severity of summer drought towards the east. On the coast-interior gradient a major non-climatic variable in the gradient is rock cover. High rock cover is a feature of the interior ranges. Soils with organic horizons or with E horizons are a feature on the coastal mountains, but are generally lacking on the interior mountains. The other environmental gradients recognized occur on individual transects and all include edaphic variables. The rockiness-soil depth gradient, on which an increase in rockiness is associated with a decrease in soil depth and usually a decrease in clay content, tends to occur in three situations. Firstly, it is associated with local topographic variation; the shallow, rocky soils being a feature of the steeper slopes. Secondly, it is associated with the aspect gradient; the hot, dry northern aspects having shallow, rocky, less developed soils. Thirdly, it tends to be associated with the altitude-rainfall gradient: shallower soils being found at higher altitudes. It is also at higher altitudes that higher rainfall is found. Variation in oxidizable carbon is chiefly accounted for by the altitude-rainfall gradient. Whereas at a biome-wide level, aspects of soil fertility are related to soil texture, it appears that on individual transects fertility is linked to amounts of plant remains in the soil and to rainfall. Apart from these gradients, which are found on the Table Mountain quartzites, other sources of environmental variation are due to the differences between geological types. The non-quartzitic soils are generally deeper and finer-textured. It is suggested that the nutrient-poor/nutrient-rich distinction must be used with care; at least in the mountains the distinction should not automatically be substituted for the quartzitic/non-quartzitic distinction.",

This article provided a review on the adaptation capabilities of mopane against fire, browsing activity and environmental stresses. It further reviewed and tested the extent to which rainfall, temperature, altitude and soil types had an effect on the distribution of mopane in southern Africa. Mopane is adapted to survive moisture stresses, low nutrient environments and even disturbances caused by fire and browsing by large herbivores through its physical, physiological and chemical responses. Adaptation of mopane to various stresses enables it to dominate the low-lying areas of southern Africa’s savannas. The distribution of mopane is best associated with low to moderate rainfall (R2 = 0.38), high temperature (R2 = 0.42), low altitudes (R2 = 0.44) and a variety of soil types. An increase in the annual rainfall ( 800 mm) and altitude ( 800 m.a.s.l.), coupled with a reduction in the minimum temperature and acidic soil, limits the distribution of mopane. Mopane in South Africa occurs under similar environmental conditions to those in Zimbabwe and Zambia, but quite different from those in Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi and Botswana where mopane occurs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite considerable research into the importance of ecosystem services, little has been achieved in translating such research into management action. In an urban context where numerous pressures on ecosystem services exist, the identification and management of priority ecosystem services areas are vital to ensure the ongoing provision of these services.Method: To identify opportunities for securing a sustainable supply of ecosystem services for the city of Durban, this paper identifies ecosystem service priority areas, called hotspots, and assesses their spatial congruence with critical biodiversity areas (CBAs), conservation areas, the Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (D’MOSS) and land ownership categories, using spatial overlap and correlation analyses. Hotspots for 13 ecosystem services were identified and analysed, including carbon storage, nutrient retention, sediment retention, water supply and flood attenuation.Results: The study found generally weak correlations between ecosystem service hotspots and CBAs and conservation areas. On average, 30% of the 13 ecosystem services hotspots were located within terrestrial CBAs, 51% within the D’MOSS, with nominal overlaps of 0.3%, 3.9% and 5.07% within estuaries and freshwater CBAs and conservation areas, respectively. The majority of ecosystem service hotspots were located within communally (41%) or privately owned (27%) lands.Conclusion: The results indicated that substantial portions of hotspot areas lie outside of formally regulated and managed conservation areas and remain vulnerable to human impact and habitat degradation. The study identified management areas and options that could yield maximum benefits; including the need for the development of an ecosystem services management and protection strategy, the selection of areas for co-management of ecosystem service hotspots and CBAs and the need for collaborative management.",

As South Africa shares land borders with six countries, multiple opportunities exist for the transfer of alien species between South Africa and other African countries; however, the direction and importance of intra-regional spread is unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to gain a greater understanding of the introduction of alien species into Africa and the spread of species between South Africa and other African countries. Method: We developed scenarios that describe the routes by which alien species are introduced to and spread within Africa and present case studies for each. Using data from literature sources and databases, the relative importance of each scenario for alien birds and insect pests of eucalypts was determined, and the direction and importance of intra-regional spread was assessed. Results: Alien species from many taxonomic groups have, through various routes, been introduced to and spread within Africa. For birds and eucalypt insect pests, the number of species spreading in the region has recently increased, with South Africa being a major recipient of birds (14 species received and 5 donated) and a major donor of eucalypt insect pests (1 species received and 10 donated). For both groups, many introduced species have not yet spread in the region. Conclusion: The intra-regional spread of alien species in Africa represents an important and possibly increasing threat to biosecurity. To address this threat, we propose a framework that details how African countries could cooperate and develop a coordinated response to alien species introductions.",

    "abstract": "Background: The sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), South Africa’s southernmost territories have high conservation value. Despite their isolation, several alien species have established and become invasive on the PEIs. Objectives: Here we review the invasion ecology of the PEIs. Methods: We summarise what is known about the introduction of alien species, what influences their ability to establish and spread, and review their impacts. Results: Approximately 48 alien species are currently established on the PEIs, of which 26 are known to be invasive. Introduction pathways for the PEIs are fairly well understood – species have mainly been introduced with ship cargo and building material. Less is known about establishment, spread and impact of aliens. It has been estimated that less than 5% of the PEIs is covered by invasive plants, but invasive plants have attained circuminsular distributions on both PEIs. Studies on impact have primarily focussed on the effects of vertebrate invaders, of which the house mouse, which is restricted to Marion Island, probably has the greatest impact on the biodiversity of the islands. Because of the risk of alien introductions, strict biosecurity regulations govern activities at the PEIs. These are particularly aimed at stemming the introduction of alien species, and are likely to have reduced the rates of new introductions. In addition, some effort is currently being made to eradicate selected range-restricted species. However, only one species that had established and spread on the PEIs, the cat, has been successfully eradicated from the islands. Conclusion: Given the ongoing threat of introductions, and the impacts of invaders, it is essential that future invasions to the PEIs are minimised, that the islands’ management policies deal with all stages of the invasion process and that a better understanding of the risks and impacts of invasions is obtained.",

    "abstract": "Background: The city of Durban in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, falls within a global biodiversity hotspot. KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS) is a savanna vegetation type endemic to KZN. KZNSS is endangered; about 90% has been totally modified and 0.1% of the original extent is adequately protected. In response, eThekwini Municipality, Durban’s local government authority, has developed approaches to improve the conservation status of KZNSS and other biodiversity.Objectives: To describe eThekwini Municipality’s work in contributing to securing and managing KZNSS and other biodiversity. This information will contribute to an increased understanding of local government’s role in biodiversity conservation and should be relevant to other local governments as well.Method: Statistics from the municipality’s GIS database and work done and insights gained over about 30 years are presented.Results: By 2012, about 54% of Durban’s original vegetation was transformed and a further 17% was highly degraded. Combined efforts have resulted in 3.06% of the eThekwini Municipal Area enjoying some form of legal protection for environmental purposes with proclaimed protected areas covering 0.6% of the municipal area. Nearly 8% of areas identified as environmentally significant by the municipality are managed as appropriate.Conclusion: Increased and coordinated implementation efforts with a focus on priorities are needed from all role players if biodiversity is to be adequately conserved in Durban. Local government in South Africa can be an important contributor in biodiversity conservation, especially with regard to tools available in terms of its local planning mandate.",

Distribution ranges of the studied species were updated.Results: An examination of morphological characters revealed great similarity between T. spartioides and T. confine. Both species have an herbaceous habit, decumbent growth form, terminal (or less frequently axillary) inflorescences and a sympatric northern distribution in South Africa. Thesium durum differs from T. spartioides and T. confine in having a shrubby habit, erect growth form and axillary inflorescences and occurs in the southern part of South Africa.Conclusion: Thesium spartioides is synonymised under T. confine, and T. durum is retained as a separate species.",

The pollen record from the Cape Peninsula may point to the extinction of some taxa by the terminal Miocene/Early Pliocene with the subsequent strong development of macchia. This major change can probably be related to the maximum build-up of the Antarctic ice-cap in the latest Miocene and the accompanying profound palaeoceanographic changes such as the major cooling of the Benguela current with its effect on the aridification of the Namib desert, and the global glacio-eustatic sea level drop.Parallel palynological and lithological studies in the Saldanha region show that prominent Miocene vegetation shifts were linked to profound local changes in the palaeoenvironment associated with the northward migration of the Miocene Berg River. Such studies are of paramount importance for the possible assessment of the causes of changes in the palaeoenvironment and should first be carried out at many more sites over a wide region. It is to some extent premature to draw firm conclusions as to the origin and migration of some taxa in southern Africa. The record of very primitive angiosperms such as the ClavatipolleniteslAscarina complex and Winteraceae is of considerable phytogeographic interest.",

The subset of 233 species, belonging to 58 families, includes all important declared species and some potentially important species. Almost as many species originate from temperate regions (112) as from the tropics (121).

Transformers account for 33% of all species. More transformers are of tropical origin (36) than of northern temperate (24) and southern temperate origin (18). However. 50% of southern temperate species are transformers, compared to 32% of northern temperate and 29% of tropical species. Southern temperate transformer species are mainly woody trees and shrubs that were established on a grand scale as silvicultural crops, barriers (hedges, windbreaks and screens) and cover/binders. Most aquatics, herbs, climbers and succulent shrubs an. trom the tropics. Ornamentals are the single largest category of plants from all three regions, the tropics having contributed twice as many species as temperate regions.",

    "abstract": "Background: South Africa has a long history of managing biological invasions. The rapid increase in the scale and complexity of problems associated with invasions calls for new, more strategic management approaches. This paper explores strategic management approaches for cactus invasions in South Africa. Cacti (Cactaceae) have had a long history of socio-economic benefits, considerable negative environmental and socio-economic impacts, and a wide range of management interventions in South Africa. Objectives: To guide the future management of cactus invasions, a national strategic framework was developed by the South African Cactus Working Group. The overarching aim of this framework is to reduce the negative impacts of cacti to a point where their benefits significantly outweigh the losses. Method: Four strategic objectives were proposed: (1) all invasive and potentially invasive cactus species should be prevented from entering the country, (2) new incursions of cactus species must be rapidly detected and eradicated, (3) the impacts of invasive cacti must be reduced and contained and (4) socio-economically useful cacti (both invasive and non-invasive species) must be utilised sustainably to minimise the risk of further negative impacts. Results: There are currently 35 listed invasive cactus species in the country; 10 species are targeted for eradication and 12 are under partial or complete biological control. We discuss approaches for the management of cactus species, their introduction and spread pathways and spatial prioritisation of control efforts. Conclusion: A thorough understanding of context-specific invasion processes and stakeholder support is needed when implementing strategies for a group of invasive species.",

However, this requires knowledge of the introduction pathways, factors influencing establishment success, invasive potential, current distributions and ecological impacts. Objectives: To evaluate the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK) to predict the invasion risk posed by fish species proposed for introduction into South Africa. Method: FISK assessments were compiled for species whose invasion status in South Africa was known. A Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to calibrate the FISK for South Africa. The calibrated FISK was used to evaluate the risk that three species recently proposed for importation for aquaculture could become invasive in South Africa. Results: A FISK score of 14 was identified as the threshold to delineate between species that could become invasive in South Africa and those that are unlikely to become invasive. Of the three species evaluated, Silurus glanis had a high risk of becoming invasive in South Africa, Lates calcarifer was likely to be invasive and Oncorhynchus tshawytscha was unlikely to be invasive in South Africa. Conclusion: FISK was demonstrated to be a useful risk assessment tool to evaluate the invasion risk posed by species proposed for use in aquaculture. For the large number of fish imported for the pet trade, a rapid screening assessment to flag potentially high risk species was recommended prior to a full FISK assessment for flagged species.",

Using historical literature, we reviewed past efforts to introduce alien grasses into South Africa. We sourced information on the origins, uses, distributions and minimum residence times to investigate pathways and patterns of spatial extent. We identified alien grasses in South Africa that are having environmental and economic impacts and determined whether management options have been identified, and legislation created, for these species. Results: There are at least 256 alien grass species in the country, 37 of which have become invasive. Alien grass species richness increased most dramatically from the late 1800s to about 1940. Alien grass species that are not naturalised or invasive have much shorter residence times than those that have naturalised or become invasive. Most grasses were probably introduced for forage purposes, and a large number of alien grass species were trialled at pasture research stations. A large number of alien grass species in South Africa are of Eurasian origin, although more recent introductions include species from elsewhere in Africa and from Australasia. Alien grasses are most prevalent in the south-west of the country, and the Fynbos Biome has the most alien grasses and the most widespread species. We identified 11 species that have recorded environmental and economic impacts in the country. Few alien grasses have prescribed or researched management techniques. Moreover, current legislation neither adequately covers invasive species nor reflects the impacts and geographical extent of these species. Conclusion: South Africa has few invasive grass species, but there is much uncertainty regarding the identity, numbers of species, distributions, abundances and impacts of alien grasses. Although introductions of alien grasses have declined in recent decades, South Africa has a potentially large invasion debt. This highlights the need for continued monitoring and much greater investment in alien grass management, research and legislation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Concern has been expressed about the effectiveness of invasive alien plant (IAP) control operations carried out by Working for Water (WfW). South African legislation now also requires reporting on the effectiveness of IAP management interventions. Objectives: We assessed the effectiveness of IAP management practices in a large fynbos protected area, the Garden Route National Park, South Africa. Methods: We undertook field surveys of pre-clearing IAP composition and the quality of treatments applied by WfW during 2012–2015 in 103 management units, covering 4280 ha. We furthermore assessed WfW data for evidence of change in IAP cover after successive treatments, and adherence to industry norms. Results: Despite the development of detailed management plans, implementation was poorly aligned with plans. The quality of many treatments was inadequate, with work done to standard in only 23% of the assessed area. Problems encountered included (1) a complete absence of treatment application despite the payment of contractors (33% of assessed area); (2) treatments not being comprehensive in that select areas (38%), IAP species (11%) or age classes (8%) were untreated; (3) wrong choice of treatment method (9%); and (4) treatments not applied to standard (7%). Accordingly, successive follow-up treatments largely did not reduce the cover of IAPs. Inaccurate (or lack of) infield estimation of IAP cover prior to contract generation resulted in erroneous estimation of effort required and expenditure disparate with WfW norms. Conclusions: We advocate rigorous, compulsory, infield assessment of IAP cover prior to contract allocation and assessment of the quality of treatments applied prior to contractors’ payment. This should improve the efficiency of control operations and enable tracking of both the state of invasions and effectiveness of management.",

Here we describe a strategy for the management of Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) in South Africa. P. hysterophorus is an annual herb native to tropical America, which has become invasive in over 30 countries. The strategy sets goals for (1) the prevention of spread to new areas; (2) local eradication of isolated populations; (3) containment in areas where eradication is not possible; and (4) actions to protect assets where containment is no longer an option. We developed both a national strategy to set policy and to monitor progress towards goals at a national level and an implementation plan to set goals and timeframes for their achievement at local levels. It is not clear, at this stage, whether or not the goals of the strategy are achievable because implementation will face many challenges arising from ecological features of the target plant, social and cultural practices that will influence management, inadequate levels of funding and multiple political considerations. Our strategy proposes regular assessment using high-level indicators, a practice that is widely recognised as essential but seldom implemented at a national scale. Because the outcomes are uncertain, it is vital that regular monitoring of outcomes should be instituted from the start, so that both appropriate adjustments can be made to the strategy and lessons for the implementation of similar strategies elsewhere can be derived.",

    "abstract": "Background: The indigenous KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZN SS) grassland is highly endemic and species-rich, yet critically endangered and poorly conserved. Ecological threats to this grassland ecosystem are exacerbated by encroachment of woody plants, with severe negative environmental and economic consequences. Hence, there is an increasing need to reliably determine the extent of encroached or invaded areas to design optimal mitigation measures. Because of inherent limitations that characterise traditional approaches like field surveys and aerial photography, adoption of remotely sensed data offer reliable and timely mapping of landscape processes.Objectives: We sought to map the distribution of woody vegetation within the KZN SS using remote sensing approaches.Method: New generation RapidEye imagery, characterised by strategically positioned bands, and the advanced machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) were used to determine the distribution and composition of alien and indigenous woody vegetation within the KZN SS.Results: Results show that alien and indigenous encroachment and invasion could be mapped with over 86% accuracy whilst the dominant indigenous and alien tree species could be mapped with over 74% accuracy. These results highlight the potential of new generation RapidEye satellite data in combination with advanced machine learning technique in predicting the distribution of alien and indigenous woody cover within a grassland ecosystem. The successful discrimination of the two classes and the species within the classes can be attributed to the additional strategically positioned bands, particularly the red-edge in the new generation RapidEye image.Conclusion: Results underscore the potential of new generation RapidEye satellite data with strategically positioned bands and an advanced machine learning algorithm in predicting the distribution of woody cover in a grassland ecosystem.",

Mortality of woody plants was very low with, for example, that of individuals of Ochna pulchra being between 1 and 5%. Some species where the above-ground parts were often burned away completely, as in Grewia flavescens, no mortality of individuals occurred. Basal regeneration shoot mass was found to depend parabolically on plant height while the ratio of leaf to twig mass in basal shoot regeneration varied inversely with plant height in Ochna pulchra. The ability of Ochna pulchra plants to produce new basal shoots appeared to not only depend on size of the plant but also on the number of basal shoots present prior to the fire. In live Ochna pulchra plants basal regeneration shoot biomass per individual was found to increase exponentially with greater reduction in canopy leaf biomass. This relation was also affected by possible direct heat effects. Basal shoot regeneration mass was found to vary greatly with species and varied from 0,7 g/individual for Dichapetalum cymosum to 285,6 g/individual for Euclea natalensis. There was a clear tendency for non-suffrutex shrub species to have greater mean basal regeneration shoot mass per plant than that of most tree species. There was a compensatory effect in Ochna pulchra between number and size of basal regeneration shoots. Standing dead woody plant individuals (before the burn) were either felled by fire or apparently unaffected by fire and there was no selectivity by species. Results of the present study are generally supported by other work on the effects of fire in savanna and some other vegetation types.",

Herbaceous aliens were not surveyed. An analysis of the habitats being invaded by these alien plants is presented and it is concluded that riverine and forest-edge habitats are those most seriously threatened by alien plant infestations. The distribution, nature and history of the infestations of each species are summarized. Distribution maps given for the eight species which are currently most important in the Complex. The potential threat posed by each species is estimated and the species are ranked in order of priority for control action. The South American composite, Chromolaena (Eupatorium) odorata, is identified as being the alien species currently posing the greatest threat to natural vegetation in the Complex. The Asian tree, Melia azedarach, is considered the second most important alien species invading the area. It is concluded that both these species should be declared noxious weeds throughout the Republic and that research into their biological control is urgently required.",

Biomass in stands of about two years old ranged from about 2 200 kg per ha to about 7 500 kg per ha. Mature stands comprised about 11 000 to 15 000 kg per ha in heaths and 15 000 to 26 000 kg per ha in sclerophyllous scrub. The data indicate a maximum annual growth rate of 1 000 to 4 000 kg per ha early in the development of a stand, but growth rates appear to decline rapidly as communities age. Young stands are dominated by hemicryptophytes, which comprise about 2 000 to 6 000 kg per ha, or about 60 to 75 per cent of the biomass in stands of about four years old. Shrubs become prominent later, but the hemicryptophytes persist. The data indicate that the biomass, growth rates and the shape of the growth curves of fynbos communities are on the whole similar to those of analogous vegetation in other zones of mediterranean type climate. However, there are important structural differences in that analogues of the northern hemisphere (garrigue, chaparral) do not have a significant component of persistent hemicrytophytes. Although Australian heath communities do have this feature, the hemicryptophytes are not as prominent as in fynbos.",

    "abstract": "Background: Increasing numbers of invasive alien plant (IAP) species are establishing around the globe and can have negative effects on resident animal species function and diversity. These impacts depend on a variety of factors, including the extent of invasion, the region and the taxonomic group affected. These context dependencies make extrapolations of IAP impacts on resident biota from region to region a substantial challenge. Objectives: Here, we synthesised data from studies that have examined the effects of IAPs on animal diversity in South Africa. Our focus is on ectothermic organisms (reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates). Method: We sourced relevant articles using keywords relating to (1) the effects of IAPs on species diversity (abundance, richness and composition), (2) the IAP and (3) the native ectotherm. We extracted the taxonomic and spatial coverage of IAPs and affected native species and assessed the extent of information given on potential mechanisms driving IAP impacts. Results: Across the 42 studies, IAPs had a decreasing or neutral effect on native animal abundance and richness and significantly changed species composition. This review highlighted the paucity of studies and the research deficits in taxonomic and geographic coverage and in the mechanisms underlying IAP impacts on ectotherms. Conclusion: By assessing the status of knowledge regarding the impacts of IAPs on resident animal species in South Africa, this study identifies information gaps and research priorities at the country level with a view to informing monitoring and conservation efforts, such as alien plant removal and control programmes, and ensuring that endemic terrestrial animal diversity is maintained.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many alien plant species, such as Tithonia diversifolia, T. rotundifolia and T. tubaeformis, have been introduced to areas outside of their natural distribution range to provide benefits, but have subsequently become invasive, threatening biodiversity and agricultural productivity.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the current distribution and dates of introduction of invasive Tithonia species in eastern and southern Africa and to document the effects of T. diversifolia on rural livelihoods in Zambia.Method: Roadside surveys, and other sources of information, were used to determine the distribution of invasive Tithonia species in eastern and southern Africa. Household interviews were conducted to gauge perceptions and understand the impacts of T. diversifolia on local livelihoods in Zambia’s Copperbelt province.Results: Tithonia diversifolia is widespread in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Malawi and parts of Zambia but less so in Zimbabwe. Tithonia rotundifolia was comparatively uncommon in eastern Africa but common in some southern African countries, while T. tubaeformis was invasive in Swaziland, South Africa, Zambia and possibly also Zimbabwe. According to the majority of respondents in Zambia, T. diversifolia has negative impacts on native vegetation, mobility or access, water availability, crop yields and animal health.Conclusion: Invasive Tithonia species are widespread and spreading throughout much of Africa. Livelihood and biodiversity costs have not been considered by those actively promoting the use and further dissemination of T. diversifolia. We therefore recommend that detailed cost–benefit studies should be undertaken to support informed decisions on the future management of these species.",

    "abstract": "Background: South Africa hosts a large number of non-native freshwater fishes that were introduced for various industries. Many of these species are now listed under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA) Alien and Invasive Species (AIS) lists and regulations, though the practical options available to conservation agencies to effectively manage these fishes vary greatly among species and regions. Objectives methods: We assessed the history and status of national legislation pertaining to invasive freshwater fishes, and the practical implications of the legislation for managing different species with contrasting distributions, impacts and utilisation value. Results: The smallmouth bass, despite being a potential conflict-generating species, is fairly straightforward to manage based on current legislation. Two species of trout, which remain absent from the NEM:BA AIS lists because of ongoing consultation with stakeholders, continue to be managed in regions like the Western Cape province using existing provincial legislation. To maximise the limited capacity for management within conservation agencies, we proposed a decision-support tool that prioritises invasive fish populations that represent high environmental risk and low potential for conflict with stakeholders. Using three case studies, we demonstrated how the tool can be used to set management goals of ‘eradicate’, ‘manage against impacts and further spread’ and ‘continue to monitor population’ as the most pragmatic solutions given the state of an invasion, its socio-economic impact and the capacity of the responsible agency to act. Conclusion: By choosing a pragmatic management strategy, conservation agencies can maximise the effective deployment of limited resources, while minimising avoidable conflicts with stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Background: Grasslands are heavily utilised for livestock agriculture and the resultant degradation through mismanagement contributes to an estimated 60% of this biome being permanently transformed. This study focused on the impact of fire and grazing in moist highland grasslands.Objectives: To determine the contribution of burning frequency and grazing intensity combined (for domestic livestock and indigenous ungulates) on vegetation structure heterogeneity and species diversity.Methods: Eight study sites under different management regimes were sampled over two summers. Vegetation structure characteristics and diversity data were collected monthly within multiple replicates in each study site. A disc pasture meter was used to assess standing biomass. Differences in vegetation structure characteristics, plant community composition and plant species assemblage structure across sites were statistically analysed using analyses of variance, indicator species analyses, multidimensional scaling ordinations and two-way cluster analyses.Results: The combination of heavy grazing and annual burning leads to a distinct plant community dominated by disturbance specialist species. Selective grazing by indigenous herbivores promotes a community of unpalatable species. This study illustrates that fenced indigenous herbivores, even at moderate stocking densities, have a greater detrimental impact on plant diversity and structure than do domestic livestock.Conclusion: Intensive grazing and burning have a detrimental impact on plant species diversity and structure. This also affects resultant palatability for grazing livestock and fenced game. To promote both grazing quality and ecological integrity we recommend a minimum sustainable ‘fodder capacity’ or standing phytomass of 5000 kg per large-animal unit per hectare for domestic livestock in moist highland grasslands.",

South Africa. Management records were used to examine the role of post-fire age. fire frequency and intensity, as well as biotic interactions (competition from overstorey proteoids and alien plants) in influencing vegetation composition over this time period. The mean similarity in species composition of sites between surveys was 62%, indicating an average of nearly 40% turnover in species over the 30 year period. The main causes of this change included differences resulting from different stages in the post-fire succession as well as the impact of differential fire regimes (especially frequency effects). Competition from serotinous Proteaceae. which proved highly mobile after fire, as well as invasive Australian acacias also impacted on the composition of the vegetation over time. The study demonstrated that fynbos communities are temporally dynamic and that the changes over time in species composition are caused by a variety of processes. The study also provided evidence for the role of temporal diversity in contributing to the high species diversity in fynbos systems.",

Fifty-six tailings dams with a combined area of 5864 ha. and a similar area o f tail- ings-polluted soils, were surveyed between July 1996 and March 1997. During the survey, 376 plant species and subspecies were recorded from the dams and adjacent polluted soils, with an additional 8 6 records obtained between 1998 and 2003 (i.e. a total of 462 taxa: species and infraspecific species). Overall, the most commonly represented families were the Poaceae (107 species and subspecies), Asteraceae (81). Fabaceae (55) and Anacardiaceae (16). with other families represented by just one to 14 species. Only 60 species were common to all three regions, and of these 24 had been introduced during rehabilitation attempts. Most of the species found on tailings were persisters or natural colonizers (53-88%, depending on substrate), with the vast majority being indigenous and perennial taxa (76% and 85% respectively), with semi-woody to woody growth forms (6 6% being resprouters, forbs, shrubs and trees). Less than 4% of the naturally-colonizing taxa found during the survey had also been introduced by vegetation practitioners. The majority of introduced plants were alien herbaceous taxa. The number and frequency of annuals was only high on recently vegetated sites, whereas annuals were rarely present on old-vegetated and never-vegetated dams. This list includes a wide range of indigenous plant species that may be suitable for phytoremediation of tailings dams and polluted soils due to their apparent tolerance of acid mine drainage and salinity.",

These 50 species are predicted to become problematic invasive plants in the DAC because they possess the necessary invasive attributes and have access to potentially suitable habitat that could result in them becoming major invaders. Most of the ‘current’ emerging invasive alien plant species of the DAC are of a northern-temperate affinity and belong to the families Fabaceae and Rosaceae (four taxa each), followed by Boraginaceae and Onagraceae (two taxa each). In terms of functional type (growth form), most taxa are shrubs (9), followed by herbs (8), tall trees (5), and a single climber. The need to undertake a fieldwork component is highlighted and a list of potential study sites to sample disturbed habitats is provided. A global change driver such as increased temperature is predicted to not only result in extirpation of native alpine species, but to also possibly render the environment more susceptible to alien plant invasions due to enhanced competitive ability and pre-adapted traits. A list of emerging invasive alien plants is essential to bring about swift management interventions to reduce the threat of such biological invasions.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: A core objective in South African National Parks (SANParks) is biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of functional ecosystems, which is compromised by alien species invasions. The 2016 Alien and Invasive Species Regulations of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA) requires landowners to develop management plans for alien and invasive species, as well as report on the status and efficacy of control. Method: To compile the species list, we started with the 2011 SANParks alien species list. Name changes were updated and SANParks ecologists and park managers contacted to verify the species lists and add new records. Species reported by external experts were added in the same manner. The management programme costs and species controlled per park per year were extracted from SANParks’ Working for Water programme database. Results: SANParks has listed 869 alien and extra-limital species, including 752 plants and 117 animals, increasing from 781 alien species in 2011. About R 590 million has been spent by the Working for Water/Biodiversity Social Programmes since 2000/2001. Of the species recorded, 263 are listed by NEM:BA, including 12 Category 1a species, 184 Category 1b species, 28 Category 2 species and 39 Category 3 species. Conclusion: While large clearing programmes have been maintained since at least 1998, improving prioritisation is necessary. We provide a short synopsis of (1) what alien species are present in SANParks, (2) the species and parks that management has focused on, (3) the implications of the NEM:BA Invasive Alien Species Regulations and (4) future developments in monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Background: The South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004) (NEM:BA) requires all Organs of State at all spheres of government to develop invasive species monitoring, control and eradication plans. Municipalities across South Africa are required to comply with the Alien and Invasive Species Regulations under NEM:BA but are faced with myriad challenges, making compliance difficult. Objective: This paper unpacks some of the challenges municipalities face and provides guidance on how to overcome these in order to achieve NEM:BA compliance. Through a strategic, municipal-wide approach involving different landowners, compliance can be achieved and many of the associated challenges can be overcome. For example, lack of awareness and capacity within municipal structures can be addressed through various platforms that have proven successful in some areas. Conclusions: Using the City of Cape Town as a case study, we highlight some of the notable successes in overcoming some of these challenges. For example, the City’s Invasive Species Strategy has resulted in municipal buy-in, departmental collaboration and a city-wide invasive plant tender, allowing for streamlined invasive plant control across the city. We present a framework as a first step towards measuring compliance and how the national status report can measure the level of compliance by Organs of State.",

    "abstract": "Background: Inselberg summits adjacent to the Maloti–Drakensberg escarpment occupy an alpine zone within the Drakensberg Alpine Centre (DAC). Inselbergs, the escarpment and surrounding mountains such as Platberg experience a severe climate; inselberg summits are distinct by being protected from human disturbance.Objectives: The aim of this article was to describe for the first time the flora of inselberg summits and to assess their potential contribution to conservation of DAC plant diversity.Method: We investigated whether the flora of inselberg summits formed a representative subset of the DAC flora in terms of shared, especially endemic or near endemic, species and representation of families. All species were listed for six inselbergs between Giant’s Castle and Sentinel, located in the Royal Natal National Park (RNNP) during November 2005. Comparisons, using literature, were made with floras of the DAC, as well as Platberg, an inselberg approximately 60 km north from Sentinel in the RNNP.Results: We recorded 200 species of pteridophytes and angiosperms on inselbergs, 114 DAC endemics or near endemics, one possible new species, and several range and altitudinal extensions. Asteraceae, Poaceae and Ericaceae comprised 42.1% of endemic and near endemic species, with Scrophulariaceae and Hyacinthaceae contributing 8.8%. Inselberg and DAC floras differed in respective rankings of Crassulaceae (8th vs. 15th), Polygalaceae, Apiaceae and Rosaceae (10th, 11th, 12th vs. 15th), Poaceae (2nd vs. 5th), Cyperaceae (3rd vs. 4th) and Scrophulariaceae (6th vs. 2nd). Growth forms on inselbergs were consistent with DAC flora. Inselbergs shared 40% of species with Platberg.Conclusion: Inselbergs, which supported 7.9% of species occurring in the DAC flora, are well protected from human impact, lack alien plants, but, despite this, are highly vulnerable to climate change. Conservation importance of inselbergs will increase as escarpment vegetation becomes increasingly degraded as a consequence of intensifying land use.",

    "abstract": "South Africa has committed to producing a National Status Report on Biological Invasions by October 2017 and thereafter every three years. This will be the first status report at a national level specifically on biological invasions. As part of soliciting input, a workshop was held in May 2016 that led to this special issue of 19 papers in the journal Bothalia: African Biodiversity and Conservation. This editorial introduces the symposium, discusses the special issue and summarises how each contribution provides an estimate of ‘status’. Papers focus on key pathways, taxa, areas, and evaluations of interventions, specifically the movement of taxa between South Africa and neighbouring countries; the dispersal pathways of amphibians; a review of alien animals; a report on changes in the number and abundance of alien plants; in-depth reviews of the status of invasions for cacti, fishes, fungi and grasses; an assessment of the impact of widespread invasive plants on animals; reviews on invasions in municipalities, protected areas and subAntarctic Islands; assessments of the efficacy of biological control and other control programmes; and recommendations for how to deal with conflict species, to conduct scientific assessments and to improve risk assessments. The papers in this special issue confirm that South Africa is an excellent place to study invasions that can provide insights for understanding and managing invasions in other countries. Negative impacts seem to be largely precipitated by certain taxa (especially plants), whereas invasions by a number of other groups do not, yet, seem to have caused the widespread negative impacts felt in other countries. Although South Africa has effectively managed a few biological invasions (e.g. highly successful biological control of some invasive plants), the key challenge seems to be to establish and maintain a strong link between implementation, monitoring, reporting and planning.",

    "abstract": "Background: Wetlands are the most threatened ecosystem in South Africa despite the range of ecosystem goods and services they provide. A significant cause of wetland destruction and degradation is a lack of understanding, by planners, policymakers and developers, of their ecological and socio-economic importance.Objectives: This study assessed the floristic composition and diversity of wetlands in the former Tlokwe Municipal area along a rural–urban gradient.Methods: Fourteen wetland sites were surveyed along an urbanisation gradient. Vegetation surveys were done in quadrats along transects in each wetland recording the cover-abundance of each species. The data were analysed by using ordinations, similarity percentages, and the adjusted Floristic Quality Assessment Index.Results: Overall, the proportional species composition of urban and rural wetlands was mainly similar. Trends indicated that the alpha diversity increased with both habitat size and heterogeneity along a rural–urban gradient. In all wetlands, indigenous species were the most abundant, with the highest score in the largest urban wetland. The floristic quality varied widely along the gradient with none of the sites in pristine condition.Conclusion: The similarity in species composition and floristic quality of the wetlands, as well as the high levels of indigenous species richness, indicated that urban wetlands are worthy of conservation. However, the signs of disturbances and the presence of alien species means that restoration strategies need to be implemented to improve the quality of the wetlands.",

    "abstract": "PRESENT VEGETATION AND FLORA OF NORTHERN AFRICA, THEIR MEANING IN RELATION TO THEIR ORIGIN, EVOLUTION AND MIGRATIONS OF FLORAS AND THE STRUCTURES OF PAST VEGETATION In the light of recent works and biogeographic synthesis, the Mediterranean flora appears more and more as a heterogeneous entity, reflecting, to a great extent, the palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic history of the region. In particular, the co-existence of elements of southern stock and of northerly elements, presently points to the possibilities of exchange which occurred very early in the Tertiary between the Gondwanian type of floras or the less tropical types and the Laurasian floras.The tropical elements are numerous and can be linked to various entities according to their age; a pantropical entity comprising in particular, Tetraclinis and Warionia, but also various families, is common to all the tropical regions and, without any doubt, contemporary with the dismemberment of Gondwana; a north-tropical entity peculiarly common to California and the Mediterranean region; a palaeotropical entity strongly heterogeneous and complex. One finds there: — thermophilous sclerophyll types often linked to the African rainforest species, — old xerophilous types, distributed in South Africa and north of the Equator (randflora), — endemic taxa of high African mountains, showing affinities with Ethiopian species or of the high African mountains, — taxa more recently arrived or even common sahelian species settled during the last pluvial. The elements of extratropical stock are composed of autochthonal or Mediterraneo-Tertiary elements, and of northern elements. The Mediterraneo-Tertiary elements are the remnants of differentiated floras generally in situ on the banks of the Tethys and on the micro-plates which occur there. The role of the Iberian micro-plate is particularly important in the western Magreb. It is advisable to associate them with various species belonging to the Irano-touranian and Saharo-Arab stocks, whose settlement is often recent. An oro-Mesogean entity is particularly important and brings together the endemo-vicariant taxa generally occurring from the Atlas to the western Himalayas. The northern elements bring together a mesothermal entity, a remnant o f the pre-glacial Lauresian floras, poorly represented in north Africa, a microthermal northern entity generally comprising species recently established and a north-alpine entity contemporary with the last glaciations, extremely localized on the high Atlas mountains. Finally, the origin of the main characteristic formations of the Mediterranean stages is examined and discussed.",

As a whole, floristic and taxonomic studies on this genus are still incomplete. Objectives: The main objective was to record the North American species Amaranthus palmeri in Tunisia for the first time and to point out a second occurrence for Africa. At the same time, we highlight some nomenclatural confusion concerning the name A. palmeri var. glomeratus which appears to be untypified and which should be treated at species rank. Method: The work is based on field surveys, analysis of relevant literature and examination of specimens preserved in the herbaria GH, FI, HFLA, K, MICH, NEBC, NY, MO, P, RO, US, and the Herbarium of Bizerta University. Results: A population of Amaranthus palmeri was discovered in Bizerta Province, representing the first record for the national flora. This record also represents the second record for Africa. Morphological characters, as well as ecological data are provided. Nomenclatural notes are provided for A. palmeri var. glomeratus (lectotype at GH, here designated; isolectotypes at MICH and US), and a new name (A. sonoriensis) is proposed. Conclusion: Amaranthus palmeri is an alien species in Tunisia, growing along roadsides and in public gardens. Future monitoring of the populations found will be necessary to verify possible naturalisation and spreading of A. palmeri in Tunisia. If this happens, actions for eradication of the plants will be necessary.",

Objectives: To provide such an analysis to facilitate effective ecological management, and compile a comprehensive inventory of introduced animal species across major habitats. Methods: All available databases and references were used to compile the inventory, forming the basis of subsequent analyses. A graduated map was produced to identify concentrations of alien species.Results: Of the 571 alien animal species analysed, insects comprised the largest component (53%, 300 species), followed by molluscs (9%, 51 species), annelids (8%, 48 species), arachnids (7%, 41 species), vertebrates (7%, 41 species) and crustaceans (6%, 36 species). Vertebrate introductions (88%) were largely intentional, whereas 84% of invertebrate introductions were unintentional. Conclusions: Almost all marine and most terrestrial alien species were accidentally introduced, whereas freshwater introductions were almost entirely intentional. Some 13% had not spread significantly, 16% had spread significantly and 71% had become fully invasive. Vertebrate introductions virtually ceased after the 1950s, but rate of introduction of invertebrates remained linear. The overall rate of species accumulation was fairly low until 1880, but accelerated sharply thereafter. Most terrestrial alien species originated from Europe (28.6%) and Asia (25.0%) and the lowest proportion (6.1%) from Africa. Freshwater introductions largely originated from the Americas, with few from Africa. The most invaded areas were around Cape Town, (up to 162 introduced species/half-degree grid cell), followed by Gauteng and Durban",

Sand Forest, a dry semi-deciduous type in northeastern KwaZulu-Natals defined by the presence of the canopy dominant Cleistanthus schlechteri as well as Hymenocardia ulmoides, Psydrax fragrantissima, Croton pseudopulchellus and Drypetes arguta. Sand Forests form a cohesive group in both DCA and TWINSPAN analyses, with similar composition of canopy dominants at sampled sites. This implies that ecological funcioning is similar across the geographical range in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal. However, turnover of subdominant species between recognisable Sand Forest types emphasizes the need to conserve the full range of extant forests.",

This paper compares the performance of two methods, association-analysis and the Braun-Blanquet method as developed by the Zurich-Montpellier School of Phytosociology. One hundred 50 m2 sample plots, covering the whole Reserve, were placed systematically at grid intersections on the 1:18 000 topographical map. at 1 000-yard (914 m) intervals. Species lists, recording merely presence of all species with permanently recognizable aerial parts, were made for each plot. The association-analysis resulted in a classification of 23 final groups of sample plots, of which only five groups showed high floristic and ecological homogeneity. Of the remainder, eight groups contained some anomalous, misplaced plots, and ten represented small, isolated fragments of natural units. The original data were then analysed using Braun-Blanquet methods to provide an independent classification for comparison with the former. The Braun-Blanquet communities were found to be more homogeneous in terms of previously defined habitat groupings and showed floristic relationships consistent with these groupings. It is concluded that, with the type of sampling used, the synthetic phytosociological Braun-Blanquet method provides a more natural classification of plant communities of the Reserve than does the monothetic divisive association-analysis method.",

In the montane areas of East Africa and also in southern Africa the temperature dropped by about 6°C. During this hypothermal period, rainfall on the east African plateau and mountains diminished. Summer precipitation could still penetrate the eastern half of southern Africa from the Indian Ocean, while the western half was arid to semi-arid. Cyclonic winter rain migrated further north beyond the latitude of the Orange River. The consequences of these climatic changes during the last glacial maximum were that the woodlands of East Africa opened up. On the plateau of South Africa austro-afroalpine vegetation dominated. The south coastal plain was very windy and cold to temperate, while the Namib and Kalahari were respectively hyper-arid and semi-humid. During hyperthermals the vegetation pattern resembled present-day conditions more closely.",

II en résulte qu’á l'Eocêne inférieur, l’équateur se trouvait á environ 1 000 km au nord de sa position actuelle. Ces modifications aboutissent á des transformations importantes de l’environnement climatique et par consequent de la repartition des flores. Cela explique notamment la presence d’une mangrove en Libye avec Sonneratioxylon aubrevillei et en Egypte avec Nipa burtinii.La forêt dense est présente dans le Paléocêne du Tinrhert avec Entandrophragmoxylon normandii (comparable á l’actuel Entandrophragma angolense). Les formations de foret dense, développées á l’Eocêne, surtout sur le rivage, sont suivies plus au sud, d’une savane qui s’étend davantage á I’Oligocêne et qui peut atteindre la mer. Cependant, on trouve encore en bordure de mer á l’Oligocêne, des espêces de forêt dense comme Entandrophragmoxylon magnieri (comparable á Entandrophragma candollei) espêce qui avoisine des dépóts deltaiques avec de grands troncs qui indiquent une flore plus sêche (Detarioxylon aegyptiacum, Combretoxylon bussonii et Pterocarpoxylon tibestiense (rapproché du Pterocarpus erinaceus de savane), mais parfois accompagnée de troncs de forêt-galerie (Atherospermoxylon aegyptiacum, Monimiacée). Au Miocene, l’assechement continue et la savane progresse. Les Palmiers apparaissent et des galeries forestieres subsistent, mais même á proximité de la mer, le biotope est sec au Miocene inférieur dans le Nord de l’Afrique.

    "abstract": "Background: Harmful alien species impose a growing environmental, economic and human well-being burden around the globe. A promising way to reduce the arrival of new species that may become harmful is to utilise pre-border risk assessment (RA) tools that relate the traits of introduced species to whether those species have become established and harmful. These tools can be applied to species proposed for intentional introduction so that informed decisions can be made about whether each species poses an acceptable risk and should be allowed for import. Objectives: A range of approaches to RA tool development have emerged, each relying on different assumptions about the relationships between traits and species impacts, and each requiring different levels and types of data. We set out to compare the qualities of each approach and make recommendations for their application in South Africa, a high biodiversity developing country that already has many invasive species. Method: We reviewed five approaches to pre-border RA and assessed the benefits and drawbacks of each. We focused on how pre-border RA could be applied in South Africa. Results: Recent legislation presents a framework for RA to evaluate species introductions to South Africa, but we find that this framework assumes an approach to RA that is relatively slow and costly and that does not leverage recent advances in RA tool development. Conclusion: There is potential for proven RA approaches to be applied in South Africa that would be less costly and that could more rapidly assess the suite of species currently being introduced.",

Complex assessments are appropriate for issues which are both technically complicated, multifaceted and of high societal interest. There is increasing interest from the research community that studies biological invasions to undertake such an assessment. Objectives: Providing the relevant background and context, the article describes key principles and steps for designing, planning, resourcing and executing such a process, as well as providing evidence of high-impact assessments enhancing scientific careers. Method: Experience from international and national assessments, most recently the South African scientific assessment for the Shale Gas Development in the Central Karoo, was used to develop this guiding generic template for practitioners. Analyses of researcher publication performances were undertaken to determine the benefit of being involved in assessments. Results: The key success factors for assessments mostly relate to adherence to ‘process’ and ‘governance’ aspects, for which scientists are sometimes ill-equipped. As regards publication outputs, authors involved in assessment processes demonstrated higher H-indices than their environmental scientist peers. We have suggested causal explanations for this. Conclusion: Effectively designed and managed assessments provide the platform for the ‘co-production of knowledge’ – an iterative and collaborative process involving scientists, stakeholders and policymakers. This increases scientific impact in the society–policy domain. While scientists seem concerned that effort directed towards assessments comes at the detriment of scientific credibility and productivity, we have presented data that suggest the opposite.",

Quantitative targets set to meet these aims provide a yardstick with which to measure the current conservation status of biodiversity features and measure the success of conservation actions.Objectives: The conservation targets and current ecosystem status of vegetation types and biomes occurring in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) were assessed, and their level of formal protection was determined, to inform conservation planning initiatives in the province.Method: Land cover maps of the province were used to determine the amount of natural habitat remaining in KZN. This was intersected with the vegetation map and assessed relative to their conservation targets to determine the ecosystem status of each vegetation type in KZN. The proclaimed protected areas were used to determine the level of protection of each vegetation type.Results: In 17 years (1994–2011), 19.7% of natural habitat was lost to anthropogenic conversion of the landscape. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt and Grassland biomes had the least remaining natural habitat, the highest rates of habitat loss and the least degree of formal protection.Conclusion: These findings inform conservation priorities in the province.

Despite many advantages of this technique, the delay between defaecation, sample collection and processing may influence steroid concentrations, as faecal bacterial enzymes can alter steroid composition post-defaecation.Objectives: This study investigated changes in faecal glucocorticoid (fGCM), androgen (fAM) and progestagen (fPM) metabolite concentrations in faeces of a male and female African elephant (Loxodonta africana) post-defaecation and the influence of different faeces-drying regimes.Method: Subsamples of fresh faeces were frozen after being dried in direct sun or shade for 6, 20, 24, 48 and 72 h and 7 and 34 days. A subset of samples for each sex was immediately frozen as controls. Faecal hormone metabolite concentrations were determined using enzyme immunoassays established for fGCM, fAM and fPM monitoring in male and female African elephants.Results: Hormone metabolite concentrations of all three steroid classes were stable at first, but changed distinctively after 20 h post-defaecation, with fGCM concentrations decreasing over time and fPM and fAM concentrations steadily increasing. In freeze-dried faeces fGCM concentrations were significantly higher than respective concentrations in sun-dried material, which were in turn significantly higher than fGCM concentrations in shade-dried material. In contrast, fAM concentrations were significantly higher in sun- and shade-dried faeces compared to freeze-dried faeces. Higher fPM concentrations were also found in air-dried samples compared to lyophilised faeces, but the effect was only significant for sun-dried material.Conclusion: The revealed time restriction for collecting faecal material for hormone monitoring from elephants in the wild should be taken into account to assure reliable and comparable results. However, if logistics allow a timely collection, non-invasive hormone measurement remains a powerful and reliable approach to provide information about an elephant’s endocrine status.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tropical and subtropical Africa is predicted to experience a rise in temperature. The effects of rising temperatures on temperate grasslands have been studied using open-top chambers (OTCs) but reports for tropical/subtropical grasslands are scarce. This study used OTCs to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on a threatened subtropical grassland type, namely KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS).Objectives: To assess the effects of OTCs on selected abiotic parameters and plant productivity within KZNSS.Methods: Five OTC and control plots were randomly distributed at the same altitude within a patch of KZNSS. Air and soil temperature, relative humidity (RH), soil moisture content and light intensity were monitored in all plots in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Biomass production and plant density were measured in each season, for each life form (graminoid, forb and shrub), separately and combined.Results: The OTCs resulted in a rise in average, maximum and minimum day and night, air and soil temperatures. This increase, the degree of which differed across seasons, was accompanied by a decline in RH and soil moisture content. Elevated temperatures led to a significant increase in combined, graminoid and shrub above-ground productivity (AGP) and a decrease in forb density, but in certain seasons only. Below-ground biomass production was unaffected by elevated temperatures.Conclusions: OTCs can simulate realistic increases of air temperature in subtropical grasslands. Graminoids and shrubs appear to benefit from elevated temperatures whilst forbs decrease in abundance, possibly through competition and/or direct physiological effects.",

    "abstract": "Background: The KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS) Research Programme is part of a collaborative, transdisciplinary research partnership between the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the eThekwini Municipality (EM), aimed at bridging the science-policy-practice gap. The research programme focuses on generating knowledge and capacity to support local land-use planning, management and policy development related to biodiversity and climate change issues. Objectives: The objectives were (1) to describe how a continuous reflective evaluation approach helped to better understand the research programme and its outcomes; and (2) to assess research outputs and outcomes, relevance of outcomes to the requirements of EM, and participants’ perceptions of the programme (both the outcomes and the process). Methods: The evaluation took a mixed methods approach, combining various quantitative and qualitative methods such as anonymous individual questionnaires, reflective exercises and group reflections. Results: The KZNSS programme was successful in capacity building and establishing a long-term partnership, but had lower scientific publication output and practice uptake than expected. Participants’ perceptions changed over time, with a decrease in the perceived success of addressing tangible research outcomes, and an increase in the perceived success of collaborative relationships in the partnership. Conclusion: Transdisciplinary partnerships can be a means of integrating research into policy and practice through knowledge exchange. An important lesson in the early stages of this partnership was to pay attention to the process and not only the outputs. The study highlights the importance of continuous participatory reflection and evaluation in such partnerships.",

A neutron probe was used to measure volumetric moisture content at two different soil depths. The grass biomass was analysed using ANOVA at a confidence level of 95%. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to gather information about the perceptions of local communities towards restoration in group discussions.Results: The short-term data showed that the implementation of BP as restoration method increased grass biomass production. The soil texture influenced the volumetric soil moisture. Higher soil moisture content was found in the deeper clayey soils. The local participants’ interpretation towards the restoration project was positive.Conclusion: The project increased the grazing potential and contributed to job creation to improve the well-being of the people in the community.",

    "abstract": "Background: Research and management of biological invasions traditionally focuses on state operated large scale control initiatives, with little emphasis on volunteers. Volunteering can, however, contribute to detection, eradication and containment of invasive alien plant species (IAPS). Understanding the extent of involvement of volunteers in invasive alien species management is important. Similarly, understanding volunteers’ motivations to volunteering is important to improve the success of invasive alien species management. Objective: In this study we aimed to: 1) identify volunteer groups controlling IAPS in the Western Cape province of South Africa, 2) understand their practices and contributions towards detecting and controlling IAPS, 3) examine volunteer’s motivations for controlling IAPS, and, 4) identify the challenges individual volunteers and groups face. Methods: The data were collected using online questionnaires. Results: In total, we identified 52 volunteer groups. We broadly estimate that these groups clear nearly 8000 ha of land with estimated labour costs of ZAR 6.5 million annually (equivalent to USD 0.38 million) when aligned with formal state management cost estimates. Most volunteer groups raise their own funds to facilitate their work, however, many suggest support from government entities, landowners and Non-Government Organisations would help. Most volunteers (82%) detect and report invasive species to their team leaders, citizen science platforms and relevant authorities. Volunteers themselves gain physical and psychological fulfilment and build their social capital by meeting new people. Conclusion: Our findings point to the valuable contribution of these groups, but also the need for better co-ordination and engagement between volunteer groups and mandated authorities on science, policy and management.",

The forests contain 1 438 species which belong to 155 families and 661 genera. The growth form spectra show specific patterns amongst the individual forests such as an abundance of ferns in montane forests, and of woody plants and vines in coastal forests. The richness of a forest flora increases with increasing altitudinal range within the forest. Significant linear species-area relationships exist for both woody and herbaceous species, but explain only 30% and 38% of the variation respectively in the size of the floras. In a multiple regression model the number of dispersal corridors, the proximity to other forests and mean altitude explained 81% of the variation in the number of woody species. The number of landscape types and of dispersal corridors explained 75% of the variation in number of herbaceous species. Several other factors contribute to the disproportionately large floras of relatively small forests such as at Umtamvuna, Sabie and Richards Bay. A high proportion of unique taxa are present (30% woody and 42% herbaceous species). The shared taxa show definite trends of the southward attenuation of species and the presence of elements of the Afromontane and Indian Ocean Coastal Regions.In conclusion, it is suggested that the southern Cape forests have been isolated from forests along the escarpment and mountains to the east since at least the Pliocene due to the Sundays River valley which stretches from the coast to the escarpment in the arid interior.",

    "abstract": "Great diversity is found in inflorescences of angiosperms. According to Troll this is due to the variation of two types only: the polytelic and the monotelic type. In the monotelic inflorescence, the apex of the inflorescence axis commonly ends with a terminal flower. This also applies to all the floral branches below the terminal flower. All of these branches, whether branched or not, proved to be homologous elements, and they are all referred to by the term ‘paracladia’ because these branches repeat the structure of the main axis of the flowering system. Accordingly, their ramifications are called paracladia of the 2nd to nth order. Since by the presence of the paracladia the number of flowers in the flowering system is increased, they may be called ‘enriching branches’. Consequently the whole area which produces the enriching branches may be designated as an ‘enriching field’. In the lower part of the flowering shoot this zone is commonly preceded by a ‘field of inhibition’ within which the development of paracladia is inhibited more or less abruptly. The same zonation can be recognized in the individual paracladia if these are not reduced in any way. In perennials, the axillary buds at the base of the whole stem do not develop within the same season, but will give rise to the innovation shoots at the beginning of the following season. Therefore this area has to be distinguished as a ‘field of innovation’. The polytelic type of inflorescence probably has been derived repeatedly from the monotelic during the evolution of angiosperms by reduction of the terminal flower and specialization of the paracladia of the monotelic system. The distal elements are reduced to single lateral flowers or lateral cymes (partial florescences) which constitute elements of an apical system composed of lateral flowers. Instead of ending in a single flower, the floral axis thus terminates in a multi-flowered so-called polytelic ‘florescence’. The lower lateral branches repeat the structure of the main stem by producing (indefinite) florescences themselves and therefore may be termedparacladia (of the polytelic system). As in monotelic inflorescences the area of paracladia — the ‘enriching field’ — can be preceded by a ‘field of inhibition’ and, in perennial plants, by a ‘field of innovation’.Though generally we may confirm that the inflorescences of all species investigated (about 20 000 from nearly all angiosperm families) proved to be variations of one of the two fundamental types, it sometimes needs morphological experience to apply Troll’s system to woody plants of tropical regions. Difficulties may derive from prolepsis and syllepsis of the innovation shoots, prolification of the inflorescence axis and, abundantly, by the deficiency of clearly marked limits between sprouts growing in different seasons. In each of such cases, however, the homologous flower-bearing-elements can be identified by comparing their positions within the whole system of ramification.",

Through a simple majority vote, this Section adopted rules requiring a 60% majority of votes to approve any proposal to modify the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and a simple majority to approve all other motions; motions not receiving the required majority were to be rejected. However, for the motion addressing Proposal 1584, 45.1% voted to conserve the type of the name Acacia for Australian acacias, and 54.9% voted to retain the current African type for the name Acacia. Even though this motion failed to get a 60% majority either way as required by the Section’s own rules, Section officials have concluded that the name Acacia is to be conserved for Australian acacias. Treating a motion as approved, even though it received only minority support, also violates the fundamental principle of standard parliamentary procedure—the right of the majority to approve proposals. For Acacia to be formally conserved, the Nomenclature Section needed to approve a motion addressing Proposal 1584 with a majority vote, and this never happened in Vienna. Recommendations are made on how this process might be improved.",

    "abstract": "Background: Fungi are a major component of the functioning of all terrestrial ecosystems. Objectives: To increase awareness of fungi as drivers of ecosystem processes, including invasion biology. Method: Here, I reviewed the information available regarding fungal invasions of native ecosystems in South Africa in the context of the National Status Report on Biological Invasions. Results: Only seven fungal species are regulated as invaders (all category 1b) under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA) AIS regulations. Four of these species are not yet known to occur in South Africa. Similarly, under the NEM:BA AIS regulations, two of the four species listed as prohibited (i.e. not present in the country but which would pose a threat if introduced) are already present in the country. The actual number of alien fungi in South Africa is much greater. A preliminary listing of alien fungal species is made, with a total of 9 pathogenic species known to attack indigenous plants, 11 saprotrophic species, 1 fish pathogen, 23 host-specific pathogens of listed alien terrestrial plants, 61 ectomycorrhizal species and 7 host-specific pathogens deliberately introduced as biological control agents. The majority of fungal species were introduced to South Africa most likely via the introduction of crop plants as passengers, although there are as yet very little details available on pathways of introduction into South Africa. Conclusion: For almost all aspects considered, it is concluded that there is simply not sufficient data to begin to understand the role and impact of fungal invasions in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several recent studies have documented the ethnobotanical uses of plants used in Lesotho, in particular those used for medicinal purposes. However, these reports did not make a distinction between indigenous, naturalised or invasive alien plants. Furthermore, the existing records on the status of the occurrence of these plants in the country are not up to date.Objectives: The aim of this article is to present information on the current knowledge regarding the status of invasive alien plant species in Lesotho and to discuss their ethnobotanical uses, distribution in the country, origin and safety. We further assess the existing legislation designed to regulate the spread of such plants and make a comparison with the invasiveness and regulation of such plants in the neighbouring South Africa.Method: This article is based mainly on a literature survey of published information obtained from various databases, such as Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scopus, as well as from unpublished data such as technical reports, dissertations and theses.Results: A total of 57 species, comprising one pteridophyte, one gymnosperm and 56 flowering plants (52 dicotyledons and 4 monocotyledons) are documented. Although these plants are invasive in nature, they are utilised for a variety of purposes including food, treatment of various medical conditions, cosmetics and functional uses. However, some of the species are reported to be poisonous to both animals and humans, with a majority of the plants causing skin irritation. Most of these species are widely distributed throughout the country and most of them originated from America, Europe and Asia. Although a number of reports on the occurrence of invasive alien plants have been generated, the information therein has not yet been published.Conclusion: This study has identified knowledge gaps in terms of safety and distribution of the species, as well as shortfalls in the policies intended to regulate invasive alien species (IAS) in Lesotho. Further research in this regard is therefore recommended.",

    "abstract": "Background: South Africa is characterised by high levels of biodiversity and species endemism alongside critical levels of socio-economic vulnerability, demonstrating potential for conservation practices that provide both environmental and social benefits. It is argued that communitybased conservation (CBC) practices can be strategically positioned to achieve environmental conservation objectives as well as promote local-level socio-economic development. The KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS) vegetation type is classified as endemic (to KZN, South Africa), and is at present listed as endangered. Additionally, one of the KZNSS grassland patches occurs adjacent to the low-income peri-urban community of iNanda. The study examined local community uses and perceptions of the vegetation type. Objectives: To examine the uses, perceptions and attitudes displayed by the iNanda community towards the KZNSS grassland patch. Furthermore, it is hoped that the results of this study can be utilised to inform the potential use of CBC strategies within socio-economic contexts such as iNanda. Method: A mixed methodological approach was adopted, focusing on iNanda as the case study. One hundred households were purposively interviewed. Descriptive and chi-square statistical tests were carried out to examine main data trends. Results: Respondents displayed alarming levels of unemployment (61%) and 34% relied on state grants as a source of household income. Households used the grassland for subsistence (51%), grazing (14%), recreational (13%) and cultural purposes (12%). Respondents displayed limited awareness of conservation and the ecological importance of the grassland. However, respondents recognised the need to conserve the grassland based on their perception of changes to the adjacent patch. Conclusion: Potential grassland conservation plans should consider the current use displayed by respondents. Participatory approaches to conservation such as CBC initiatives could provide much-needed socio-economic and conservation benefits.",

The process of developing regulatory lists of alien and invasive taxa should be based on scientific evidence through an objective, transparent and consistent process.Objectives: In this study, we review the development of the lists for the alien and invasive species regulations in terms of section 97(1) of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004 (NEM:BA) (Act No. 10 of 2004).Method: Lists published in the National Government Gazette were compared and assessed for changes in the taxa listed and their status between 2009 and 2016. Minutes from expert workshops convened to inform the listing were reviewed. Relevant information such as the criteria for listing taxa was extracted from minutes of the workshops.Results: Three draft versions were produced and published in the Government Gazette for public comment before the final list was published in August 2014 and promulgated in October 2014. The list is to be reviewed regularly and additional species can be added, and the status of species can be changed as additional evidence of threat levels is available – and was even amended in May 2015. The various stakeholders involved in the listing process were academics, conservation experts, managers and the general public through an inclusive process which included participation workshops or through public comment. A scoring tool based on the likelihood of invasion versus the impact of invasion was recommended for evaluating the risk of a species, but was rarely used. A number of issues relating to conflicts and approaches for listing were faced during development of lists.Conclusion: We conclude with some recommendations for future refinements in the listing process, including improving transparency and participation as well as developing standardised approaches for listing.",

A checklist is important to provide basic information on the extent of the diversity, and to provide the most recent name and classification.Objective: To present a list of all the lichenised, lichenicolous and allied fungi reported from South Africa.Methods: The list presented is entirely literature based and no attempt has been made to check the report of any taxa or their status by checking the specimens upon which they are based. Firstly, all taxa that were not reported from within the modern boundaries of South Africa were excluded. Next, the Recent literature on lichens database was searched for literature on South African lichens since 1945 and all references checked for new species or new reports, which were then added to the list. These names were then checked against Index Fungorum to ensure that the most current name was being used. Finally, the list was rationalised by excluding all synonyms and dubious infraspecific taxa.Results: The current list includes 1750 taxa in 260 genera from mainland South Africa, with an additional 100 species and 23 genera from the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, which are treated separately. The replacement name Verrucaria dagolavii Fryday is proposed for Verrucaria umbilicata Øvstedal.Conclusion: It is estimated that, when fully explored, the lichen biota of South Africa will consist of somewhere between 2500 and 3000 taxa.",

All these land uses ultimately result in a deterioration of water quality in the Mooi River.Objectives: The main objective was to relate the effects of inflowing tributaries to water quality and phytoplankton assemblages in the Mooi River.Method: Physico-chemical environmental variables were compared with water quality objectives and known limits to assess general water quality in the Mooi River over a one-year period. Water quality and phytoplankton in tributarieswere compared to that at sites upstream and downstream from their inflows to determine the extent to which the tributaries affected the Mooi River. Multivariate analysis assisted in the interpretation of phytoplankton and physico-chemical data at the different sites.Results: Seven phytoplankton phyla were identified in the Mooi River. Diatoms and green algae were most dense and diverse. Cyanobacteria were responsible for various problems, especially in the Wasgoedspruit where they dominated and reached high densities. Lowest phytoplankton density and diversity were found in the upstream and downstream sections of the river, while maximum density and diversity were found during summer in the middle reaches. The inflow of tributaries, especially the Wasgoedspruit, had a pronounced effect on water quality downstream. Phytoplankton density and diversity were less affected than chemical variables, especially nutrient concentrations.Conclusion: Various land use activities surrounding the Mooi River’s tributaries contributed to a deterioration of water quality in the main stream of the Mooi River.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sorocephalus imbricatus (Thunb.) R.Br. is a range-restricted species endemic to the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. It is currently classified as Critically Endangered in accordance with the IUCN criteria. Like many other species endemic to the CFR, S. imbricatus is subjected to several major threats including habitat loss, habitat degradation and the impacts of invasive alien species. Sorocephalus imbricatus was recently identified as a species requiring improved representation in ex-situ collections. During field work undertaken to collect germ­plasm for this purpose, a concerning number of dead and dying plants were observed. Objectives: To determine the cause of rapid death of individuals in a remnant subpopulation of S. imbricatus. Method: A field visit to a subpopulation of the only extant population, Elands­kloof, was conducted to examine the symptoms associated with S. imbricatus mortality, and to collect samples for isolation and identification of putative pathogens. Results: Dead and dying plants showed clear symptoms of root and collar rot, with Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands recovered from all samples. The collections highlighted the severe impact of P. cinnamomi on S. imbricatus, with the size of the subpopulation being reduced from 62 to 37 individuals (a 40% reduction) between October 2021 and May 2022. Conclusion: This study describes, for the first time, rapid mortality of the Critically Endangered Proteaceae species, S. imbricatus, likely caused by the invasive pathogen P. cinnamomi. This concerning discovery highlights the urgent need for greater recognition of the threat P. cinnamomi poses not only to S. imbricatus, but to the broader floristic diversity of the CFR. Importantly, it illustrates a need for a substantial body of work to be undertaken to address a significant lack of knowledge regarding the relative threat that P. cinnamomi poses to species of the CFR.",

Juvenile and mature trees of Acacia tortilis and A. nilotica occurring at Nylsvley, Northern Transvaal, were quantitatively compared in terms of some potential chemical and physical defences. Neither species showed any significant difference between juvenile and mature trees in terms o f total polyphenol content, condensed tannin content, protein precipitating ability or protein content in leaves. Both species showed age-class differences in spinescence. In A. nilotica, thorns on branch tips were longer and more closely spaced and leaves were smaller in juveniles than in adults. Hence juveniles of this species appear to be physically more heavily defended than mature plants. In A. tortilis, curved thorns were longer, but straight thorns were shorter than in mature trees. There was no difference between age classes in overall thorn density, but juveniles had a higher curved to straight thorn ratio. It is not obvious what the effects of these differences might be on mammalian browsers.",

Live individuals, including single dominant species, all other shrubs, graminoids and other herbaceous species as well as dead individuals were harvested separately in each major community type within an elevational gradient corresponding to the vegetational gradient described. Greatest biomass (14311 kg ha-1) was found in a summit restionaceous community, while lowest biomass (7564 kg ha-1) was found in a low-lying succulent Karoo community. There was an inverse relationship between elevation and percentage dead material mass and a strongly positive relationship between elevation and percentage biomass of the graminoid group.

    "abstract": "Background: The loss of biodiversity in Nigeria is escalating alarmingly. However, there is generally a paucity of information as to what taxa are endangered because of a dearth of functioning conservation agencies in Nigeria.Objectives: The aim of this research is to record the endangered medicinal and other economic plant species in the Sudan Savanna vegetation in Katsina and to provide an assessment of the various threats faced by these plants.Method: Medicinal plants were identified through oral interviews with traditional medical practitioners within the study area. Conservation statuses were assessed using a bespoke data collection and assessment form; the data were then evaluated using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List categories and criteria.Results: A total of 169 species belonging to 62 families were recorded. Of these, 43 taxa were reported to be used for ethnomedicinal practices. It was found that more than half (108) of the 169 species were threatened with extinction and one taxon (Xeroderris stuhlmannii [Taub.] Mendonca Sousa) qualifies as being Extinct locally. Threats recorded include overexploitation (24%), agriculture (15%), deforestation and desertification (12% each), invasive plants (11%), urban residential development (7%) and erosion (6%).Conclusion: Most of the plants are already under threat and require urgent conservation measures. The data point to the critical need for further research into conservation strategies and a more sustainable use of threatened plants. We recommend that the Nigerian government should establish a national Red List agency and ensure effective protected area management and community-based natural resources management.",

Erythristic (strawberry) morphs, where individuals are paler and black pigment in the coat is replaced by a red-brown colour, are exceptionally rare in the wild. Historically, few records exist, with only five putative records known from India.Objectives: To record the presence of erythristic leopards in our study site (Thaba Tholo Wilderness Reserve, Mpumalanga) and to collate records from across South Africa. Method: A network of camera traps was used to record individual leopards at Thaba Tholo. We also surveyed local experts, searched the popular South African press, and used social media to request observations.Results: Two out of 28 individual leopards (7.1%) recorded in our study site over 3 years were of this colour morph. We obtained records of five other erythristic leopards in the North West and Mpumalanga regions, with no reports outside of this population.Conclusions: Erythristic leopards are widely dispersed across north-east South Africa, predominantly in the Lydenburg region, Mpumalanga. The presence of this rare colour morph may reflect the consequences of population fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Biodiversity plays a critical role in improving the quality of life and resilience of poor urban communities in Durban. Objectives: However, the rapid densification that is taking place in the ‘rural periphery’ of the city is impacting significantly on the integrity of ecosystems, which provide valuable ecosystem services. It is also changing the relations between people and the environment. Mzinyathi and eSkebheni, in the north-west of Durban, are peri-urban areas located on Ingonyama Trust land and hence they are governed by both the traditional authority and the eThekwini Municipality. The settlement pattern is changing rapidly here as middle and upper income residents move into the area, changing the way of life from being rural and ‘traditional’ to urban and ‘modern’. Method: This paper focused on the nexus of rapid urban growth, dual governance systems, biodiversity loss and cultural change in these two areas. It adopted a qualitative methodology and social constructivist approach. Data on the value of environmental services in the area was collected through interviewing the traditional authority, provincial and municipal planners and environmentalists, and household members. Results: The paper revealed that environmental services are constructed in multiple ways within a particular socio-historical and political context, that they have value to peri-urban communities, and that their function and use is changing as a result of the ‘modernisation’ of the area. The impact of the dual governance system and traditional land allocation process on environmental services is significant. This has implications for long term sustainability, for the quality of life of peri-urban residents and for planning and urban governance.",

    "abstract": "Background: The KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZN SS) is a grassland ecosystem categorised as endangered by the terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). Pressure from urbanisation has led to the remaining areas of the KZN SS being physically fragmented, causing low connectivity levels which have diminished the biological persistence of this ecosystem.Objectives: This study aimed to quantify the overall level of habitat fragmentation of the KZN SS and determine the level of connectivity within the ecosystem, and patches of the KZN SS occurring in the eThekwini Municipal area. Using graph theory, we compared the effectiveness of broad-scale and fine-scale data sets in quantifying habitat fragmentation.Methods: The Conefor Sensinode software, which employs the bases of graph theory, was chosen to aid in assessing fragmentation levels. The integral index of connectivity (IIC) (values range from 0 to 1, with 1 highlighting optimal connectivity) was chosen as the best index to determine landscape connectivity.Results: The KZN SS was shown to be highly fragmented, especially at dispersal distances less than 500 m. This resulted in very low connectivity levels, with the highest IIC value recorded at 0.0063. Moreover, the use of either fine-scale or broad-scale data to measure connectivity differed substantially at 1000 m.Conclusion: Broad-scale data were shown to overestimate habitat fragmentation and underestimate landscape connectivity. A more apt description of KZN SS connectivity levels was realised with fine-scale data. This study recommends that crucial KZN SS patches be prioritised to safeguard this endangered ecosystem.",

The study area falls within the Maputaland Centre o f Endemism, which is part ot the Maputaland-Pondoland Region, a centre of plant diversity rich in endemic plants and animals. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed 12 distinct, mainly grassland plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation ot these communities are presented. The level o f the water table, either directly, or indirectly through its role in soil formation, is the deciding factor in defining plant communities on the geologically young sandy substrate. Fire is an essential factor, particularly in maintaining the woody grasslands, a rare vegetation type rich in geoxylic suffrutices. and unique to the Maputaland Centre. A comparison between the endemic complement in the subtropical coastal grasslands of Maputaland and the high-altitude Afromontane grasslands of the Wolkberg Centre of Endemism shows marked differences in grow th form and vegetation type partitioning between the two centres. This can probably be ascribed to the relative youth (Quaternary) of the Maputaland coastal plain and its associated plant communities. Notable for their richness in Maputaland Centre endemic/near-endemic taxa. the conservation of sand forest and woody grasslands should receive high priority. Afforestation with alien trees is the most serious threat to the biodiversity of the Maputaland coastal grasslands, not only because of habitat destruction, but also through its expected negative effect on the hydrology of the region",

Despite these variations a consistent flowering sequence between the years was observed. Possible relations between the flowering phenology and the climatic variables are discussed in detail. The present data suggest that the onset of flowering is determined indirectly by the first drop in temperature in autumn, indicating the beginning of the rainy season and presumably the start of the growing period, and/or by the increase of temperatures in the beginning of spring. The pattern and amount of rainfall within a given season mainly influenced the duration of anthesis and the number of flowers produced.",

A recent synoptic flora for the Region has established a new base line for an accurate assessment of the flora. Here we document corrections and additions to the flora at family, genus and species ranks. As treated in Cape plants, which was completed in 1999. the flora comprised 173 families (five endemic), 988 genera (160 endemic: 16.2%), and 9 004 species (6 192 endemic: 68.8%). Just four years later, a revised count resulting from changes in the circumscriptions of families and genera, and the discovery of new species or range extensions of species, yields an estimate of 172 families (four endemic), 992 genera (162 endemic: 16.3%) and 9 086 species (6 226: 68.5% endemic). Of these, 948 genera and 8 971 species are seed plants. The number of species packed into so small an area is remarkable for the temperate zone and compares favourably with species richness for areas of compa­rable size in the wet tropics. The degree of endemism is also remarkable for a continental area. An unusual family compo­sition includes, in descending order of size, based on species number. Asteraceae. Fabaceae. Iridaceae. Ericaceae. Aizoaceae, Scrophulariaceae. Proteaceae. Restionaceae, Rutaceae. and Orchidaceae. Disproportionate radiation has resulted in 59.1% of the species falling in the 10 largest families and 74.6% in the largest 20 families. Thirteen genera have more than 100 species and the 20 largest genera contribute some 31.5% of the total species number.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that there is a wide range of structural variation in the habit of the Arundineae and Ehrharteae of the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region (Cape Province, South Africa). Structural differences in the bases of the fynbos grasses have been classified into four groups: swollen, knotty tillering, weak and annual. Variation in the position of the innovation buds occurs with one group having basal perennating buds, implying that all the culm material is annual, while the second group has cauline innovation buds, leading to the development of a divaricate perennial herb. The recognition of caducous, mesic (orthophyllous) and sclerophyllous leaf blades is also possible, based on leaf morphology and anatomy. These variations in growth forms allow the classification of the Cape grasses into five guilds adapted for survival in the dense fynbos vegetation that develops between the well-spaced fires in these heathlands. The following guilds have been recognized: competition avoiders that grow on rock ledges and outcrops where competition from shrubby vegetation is reduced; reseeders, that survive the protracted interfire period as seed; geophytes, that survive this period as underground organs; coppicers, that survive as small plants; and competitors, that grow tall by means of cauline innovation buds, and so are able to compete with the shrubby heath vegetation.",

In this paper we erect one new genus, Soroveta. redelimit Platycaulos and Restio, and reduce Calopsis and Ischyrolepis to synonomy under Restio.

    "abstract": "In South Africa, wetland plants have been used for centuries and they continue to be harvested for subsistence and commercial purposes. Fibres for crafts are collected by cutting the aboveground parts. KwaZulu-Natal is one of the major basket-producing regions in southern Africa and at least twenty-two species of wetland plants are harvested for crafts. A literature review of the harvested species revealed that the impacts of cutting have only been extensively investigated for Phragmites australis (Cav.) Steud. and Juncus kraussii Hochst. The review suggested that, where plants display strong seasonal aboveground productivity patterns, cutting should take place after shoot senescence and before new shoot emergence to minimize damage to plants. Cutting in the short term could increase the density of green stems. However, in the long term in Phragmites australis, it may deplete the rhizome reserves and reduce the density of useable (longer and thicker) culms.The opportunity for sustainable harvests was investigated by considering the geographic distribution, whether species are habitat specific or not, and local population sizes of the craft plants. Juncus kraussii is of the greatest conservation concern.Ecologically sustainable wetland plant harv esting could contribute to the wise use of wetlands, an approach promoted nationally and internationally.",

This article reports on the final version of the provincial conservation plan as completed in 2011.Method: Vegetation types and quaternary catchments constituted the coarse filter biodiversity features, while rare and threatened taxa constituted the fine filter features. Ecological processes were captured by a range of landscape features, while planning for climate change primarily involved the design of a corridor network. Planning was undertaken within the ArcView linked C-plan decision support system, where a cost surface preferentially directed the selection of available sites towards low-cost areas.Results: Forty-four per cent of the province is required to achieve targets. Only 8% of features are close to having their targets met or are adequately conserved in the current protected area network of 23 protected areas covering 2.4% of the province, while 73% of features are absent or poorly represented.Conclusion: The existing protected area network is inadequate for the conservation of biodiversity in Gauteng. The Gauteng Conservation Plan identifies a set of areas that are required to achieve conservation targets. It is important that identified areas currently not in the protected area network are protected either formally or through legislated land use management processes.",

    "abstract": "Background: KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS) is an endangered subtropical grassland type, of which a large proportion occurs within the eThekwini Municipal Area (EMA).Objectives: Examining the flora of KZNSS will allow a more fundamental understanding of the potential variability across remnant patches of this vegetation type, increasing the ability to accurately delimit KZNSS from adjacent similar vegetation types.Method: Floristic data were collected using quadrats and transects for three recognised KZNSS sites (Giba Gorge Environmental Precinct (GGEP), Inanda Mountain (IM) and Springside Nature Reserve (SSNR)), all within the EMA. Alpha diversity (Shannon’s exponential and Simpson’s inverse indices) and beta diversity measures were calculated and compared across all sites. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis using the Jaccard index and a non-parametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination were used to assess similarity amongst quadrats across the three sites.Results: One hundred and thirty-one plant species were found to occur in GGEP, 95 in IM and 121 in SSNR. However, of the total 193 species found to occur collectively (i.e. quadrat and transect data combined) across the three sites, only 50 species were common to all these sites. The results of the alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed significant floristic variability both within and across the KZNSS sites sampled, with Shannon’s exponential index being highest in SSNR, followed by GGEP and lowest in IM. The lack of controlled access and unregulated burning regimes appear to have clearly affected the flora at the IM site in terms of species richness and increased evenness, as well as the relatively greater presence of introduced alien species and lower abundances of taxa of conservation concern. The pristine GGEP site had the highest number of species in total, with species being less evenly spread across the site, as well as the highest number of taxa conservation and low abundances of alien species. The main separations in the ordination results can be attributed to quadrat sampling performed pre- and post-burn.Conclusion: The floristic distinction of IM from GGEP and SSNR is attributed here to the intermediate disturbance effect of fire in grasslands which can lead to species loss if burning is too frequent. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the delimitation, classification and management of KZNSS",

Honeybush has historically been used as an herbal tea, and has proven medicinal properties. Honeybush biomass and extracts are used in the functional foods and cosmetics sectors, both locally and overseas. The growing demand for honeybush calls for increased agricultural production and a shift away from the predominantly wild harvested supply.Objectives: The current study aimed to address the lack of baseline knowledge on honeybush phenology and its associated arthropod community to advance sustainable production of commercially valued plants in the genus.Method: The study was conducted on wild and cultivated Cyclopia species (Cyclopia maculata and Cyclopia genistoides) at respective sites in the Overberg region. Sampling took place from April 2014 to April 2015 using qualitative methods for recording seasonal honeybush phenology and suction sampling for aboveground arthropods. Focal insect taxa (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera) were sorted and identified to family level and classified into functional feeding guilds.Results: Qualitative phenology observations of wild C. maculata and cultivated C. genistoides indicated a high level of congruency in seasonality of phenophase stages. Associated arthropod assemblages contained a diversity of families per functional feeding group, namely phytophagous, zoophagous and omnivorous taxa, with high seasonal variability.Conclusion: Findings highlight the complexity of ecological elements to be taken into consideration for ecologically sound honeybush cultivation. Outcomes can be applied to land management practices and governance policies promoting sustainable agroecosystems in honeybush production areas.",

In South Africa there are several different published alien species databases, but these databases were created for different purposes and vary in completeness and information content. We assessed the information content of published South African alien species databases in the context of other such databases globally, and evaluated how the information content of South African databases varies across taxonomic groups. Although introduction pathway, date of introduction, region of origin and current broad-scale distribution data are available for most taxonomic groups assessed (60% – 90%), data on invasion status, introduction effort and introduction source are available for few taxonomic groups (5% – 18%). South African alien species databases have lower information content than the detailed databases available in other parts of the world and thus cannot be utilised to the same extent. We conclude with 11 recommendations for improving South African alien species databases. In particular, we highlight the data types that should be incorporated in future databases and argue that existing data should be collated in a single, standardised meta-database to facilitate cross-taxon comparisons, highlight gaps in effort, and inform managers and policy makers concerned with alien species.",

In that regard, understanding fire regimes of different vegetation types in KwaZulu-Natal is a critical step towards the development of effective management strategies that are specific to each vegetation type. Objective: To assess the effect of different vegetation types on fire regimes in KwaZulu-Natal using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt fire products. Method: Ten years of fire data for four different vegetation types (Ngongoni Veld, KwaZuluNatal Sandstone Sourveld, Eastern Valley Bushveld and KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Belt) were extracted from the MODIS products and used as a basis to establish three parameters: annual burnt areas, fire season and fire frequency. The total burnt area within each vegetation type over the 10-year period was quantified. Results: The KZN Sandstone Sourveld had a high-burnt area of 80% in 2009 with KwaZuluNatal Coastal Belt having the least burnt area of less than 5%. Ngongoni Veld and the KwaZuluNatal Sandstone Sourveld had the highest fire frequency, while the coastal region had low fire frequencies. Results showed high fire prevalence during the late period of the dry season (which extends from June to August) across all the vegetation types. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of remotely sensed data (MODIS burned area products) in providing a comprehensive view of fire patterns in different vegetation types",

    "abstract": "Oxalis L , commonly called sorrel,is a large and cosmopolitan taxon that has undergone spectacular speciation within southern Africa (± 270 taxa). and more specifically within the winter rainfall regions of the western Cape Region (CR). The main objective of this study w as to analyse the geographical distribution of Oxalis in South Africa in relation to currently defined phytogeographic units. The observed patterns of biodiversity and endemism within South African members of the genus show interesting disjunctions and concentrations of species. Oxalis is one of the few CR taxa that is shared between the core Fynbos and Succulent Karoo Biomes, and this study therefore provides a novel insight into evolutionary trends across, and not only w ithin. these phvtogeographic units. The major centre for diversity for Oxalis is situated on Table Mountain and the northern areas o f the Cape Peninsula (grid square 3318CD). Subsidiary centres are located in the Clanwilliam/Niewoudtville and Kamiesberg regions. The reported patterns in Western Cape suggest that Oxalis species richness has been generated and retained in areas w hich have been identified as core Fynbos (Table Mountain), Fynbos refugia during interglacials (Kamiesberg). and an ecotonal region which might switch between the two biome types (Clanwilliam/ Niewoudtville). Presumably these three types of areas would provide interesting material for DNA-based phylogenetic work, and a test of the climate change 'species-pump' hypothesis proposed by Midgley et al. (2001).",

Chromosome association in 39 cultivars indicated the occurrence of univalents to heptavalents with bivalents predominating. Multivalent association analysis revealed the presence in South Africa of at least four different groups of L. camara at the diploid level. The potential for sexual reproduction must exist, at least at the diploid level, to account for differences in chromosomal behaviour that can only be attributed to hybridization. The possibility exists that the basic chromosome number may be lower than 11, or else postspeciation genomic evolution must have occurred. No cytogenetical correlation exists between the South African and Indian cultivars. The number of chiasmata per genome increases with an increase in the polyploid level. Most multivalents are of the chain type. Univalents during diakinesis are the result of asynapsis. Triploid and pentaploid plants display a markedly abnormal meiosis. L. camara is a segmental allopolyploid species.",

The pre-Colombian distribution of the genus was New World. The evolutionary history of the genus is now envisaged as including three distinct lines leading to the domesticated taxa. The route of Capsicum to the Old World is thought to have followed three different courses. First, explorers introduced it to Europe with secondary introduction into Africa via further exploratory expeditions; second, botanical gardens played a major role in introduction; and third, introduction followed the slave trade routes. Today, pepper production in Africa is of two types, vegetable and spice. Statistical profiles on production are difficult to interpret, but the data available indicate that Nigeria, Egypt, Tunisia and Ghana are the leading producers. Production is mainly a local phenomenon and large acreage is seldom devoted to the growing of peppers. The primary peppers in Africa are C. annuum and C. frutescens.",

    "abstract": "Thamnocalamus tessellatus (Nees) Soderstrom Ellis, [= Arundinaria tessellata (Nees) Munro] is the only endemic South African bamboo and occurs from the eastern districts of the Cape, through Lesotho and Natal, to the eastern Orange Free State at elevations of about 1 500-2 500 m. The Mountain Bamboo, or ‘Bergbamboes’ was first described by Nees in 1841 as a member of the genus Nastus because of the similarity, to him, of the spikelets between it and N. barbonicus, but was later transferred to the all-encompassing genus of the time, Arundinaria, the type species of which is endemic to the southeastern United States of America. Based on our present knowledge of bamboo genera, this South African species may be excluded from Nastus because the inflorescence is not a panicle but bracteate racemiform, the vegetative branches do not arise in a verticillate manner but are a series of subequal branches that are borne in a row above the nodal line and T. tessellatus has an androecium of three stamens and not six as in Nastus. The Bergbamboes, with sympodial rhizomes and branch complement of several subequal branches, can also not be maintained in Arundinaria, for monopodial rhizomes and a single branch at the node are typical of this genus. The simple, ebracteate, and exserted inflorescence of Arundinaria is also quite distinct from that of the Bergbamboes. In order to place the South African bamboo more precisely we have made comparative studies of its leaf anatomy and epidermis, gross morphology, and analyses of its inflorescence and spikelets. The results of all these studies reveal a striking resemblance to members of the Sino-Himalayan genus, Thamnocalamus, to which we have accordingly transferred the species. The results are presented, together with an interpretation of the phylogenetic position of the Bergbamboes and possible events that led to the disjunction of species in the genus.",

Section Aspasia is defined by a rosette of lanceolate to oblong leaves; large, boat-shaped, ± petaloid bracts; moderately-sized white, yellow or orange flowers, sometimes with dark central markings; thin-textured, ellipsoid capsules that are enclosed by and concealed within the persistent, papery perianth; and angular, colliculate to echinulate seeds. Twelve species are recognized in the section, separable into three series based on seed morphology. O. conicum is redefined to exclude specimens from the Eastern Cape, which are recognized as O. synanthifolium, and O. conicum subsp. strictum is raised to species status as O. strictum. The circumscription of O. duhium is expanded to include O.fimbrimarginatum and O. subcoriaceum, previously distinguished on account of their longer styles.Collections from the Roggeveld Escarpment and Klein Roggeveld that were previously included in O. fimbrimaiginatum are recognized as the new species O. corticatum Mart.-Azarin, on the basis of their unusual, thick, cartilaginous outer tunics and puberulous adaxial leaf surface. O. ceresianum is removed from the synonomy of O. thyrsoides and recognized as a distinct species on account of its extensive glossy black tepal markings, winged inner filaments, and glossy black ovary. The poorly known O. puberuhim is more ftilly described based on several recent collections, and O. leeupoortense is neotypified in the absence of any original type material. O. rupestre and O. multifolium are regarded as colour forms of the same species, for which O. rupestre is the older name. Similarly, O. roussouwii is a depauperate, pale form of O. maculatum and is thus included in the synonomy of that species. The circumscription of O. pruinosum remains unchanged. The species O. haurii, O. diphyllum and O. sephtonii from the Drakensberg Mountains of Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are excluded from section Aspasia on the basis of their turbinate capsules that are exposed by the reflexed tepals.

Once the vaccine Improvac® became available, the effect on behaviour, the reproductive organs and semen quality was tested. Improvac® was also used to attempt induction of anoestrus in elephant cows.Results: The first study proved that aggressive behaviours are significantly associated with increased faecal androgen concentrations. Musth (n = 1) and aggressive behaviour (n = 2) were down regulated and correlated with a decline in faecal androgen concentrations. Aggression and musth could be controlled with Improvac® (600 µg), but were more consistent when the dose was increased to 1000 µg administered every five to six months. The same dose down regulated testicular function and bulls (n = 17) were rendered infertile within 12 months after commencement of treatment. Initial attempts to induce anoestrous with 600 µg in free-ranging elephant cows gave inconclusive results, but 1000 µg in captive cows delivered five-monthly was successful.Conclusion: The treatment of elephant bulls with Improvac® resulted in the successful down-regulation of androgen-related behaviour and sperm production in captive and wild elephant bulls of various ages (≤ 34 years). Preliminary studies to induce anoestrus in cows with Improvac® appear to be successful.",

Another six game reserves with a total of 90 cows were added to the project. The project was then expanded to include another 18 reserves.Results: Binding of anti-pZP antibodies to elephant zona proteins was demonstrated in vitro. The KNP provided efficacy results of 56% and 80%, respectively. The contraceptive efficacy in the GMPGR and additional six reserves was 100% following calving of pregnant cows. Safety and lack of impact on social behaviour were demonstrated. In larger populations, efficacy was 95%.Conclusion: Contraceptive efficacy and safety of pZP vaccine could be demonstrated in small to large populations. The methodology is now being implemented in approximately 800 cows on 26 reserves across South Arica.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although formal protected areas in South Africa date back to the turn of the 19th century, requirements for protected area management plans only became mandatory a century later. Prior to the promulgation of the World Heritage Convention Act 49 in 1999, and subsequently the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 in 2003, requirements for management plans were voluntary, and guidance to the plan’s content was fragmented across an array of international, national and provincial policy instruments.Objectives: As there has been little academic debate on the relevance and content of protected area management plans, an improved understanding of these plans, and the role they play in biodiversity conservation, is required.Method: This article explores the evolution of the management plan, revisiting its historical and current legal context at international and national scales.Results: Despite being the principal legislative framework for management plans, the World Heritage Convention Act and the National Environmental Management Protected Area Act did not consolidate the plethora of management plan requirements, and hence did not bring clarity when these conflicted or were ambiguous.Conclusion: Legal provisions for management plans are highly fragmented. This risks plans not being complete, falling short of the requirement to ensure that protected areas fulfil the purpose for which they were established. A consolidation of relevant provisions, as well as emerging best practices is recommended. This may require the revision of South Africa’s environmental law, to provide greater clarity on the contemporary understanding of the contribution of protected areas to conservation and the well-being of people (viz. the ‘purpose’).",

    "abstract": "Background: The Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve (RHFR) is a montane forest area in south-western Cameroon. Although RHFR is presumed to be rich in biodiversity and vegetation types, little information exists regarding its floristic composition and vegetation patterns.Objectives: Our goal was to characterise vegetation patterns in the reserve and to understand how elevation influences distributions and diversity of species. We aimed to provide a first detailed plant species inventory for this important forest area, as well as basic information on forest structure.Method: We characterised floristic composition and vegetation patterns of the reserve in 25 1-ha plots along an elevational gradient from 50 m to 1778 m. In each plot, trees and lianas of diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥ 10 cm were measured; shrubs 10 cm were measured in nested plots of 0.01 ha.Results: In all, 16 761 trees, shrubs and lianas with dbh ≥ 1 cm were censused, representing 71 families, 279 genera and 617 morphospecies. Floristic composition ranged from 94 to 132 species, with a mean of 117.5 species per hectare in lowland forest (50 m – 200 m) and 36–41 species, with a mean of 38.5 species per hectare in montane cloud forest (1600 m – 1778 m) near the summit of Mount Rata. Two-way indicator species analysis classified the 25 plots into six vegetation types corresponding to lowland evergreen rainforest, lowland evergreen rainforest on basalt rocks, middle-elevation evergreen forest, submontane forest, transitional submontane forest and montane cloud forest. In all, 0.006% of the reserve was included in our sample plots. Detrended correspondence analysis highlighted the importance of elevation in shaping vegetation patterns.Conclusion: The RHFR is composed of different vegetation types, which show impressive variation in terms of structure, species composition and diversity. The detailed, fine-scale inventory data obtained in this study could be useful in planning efficient management of this and other montane tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "The taxonomic status of Quisqualis L., a genus closely related to and sometimes considered congeneric with Combretum Loefl., is discussed. The genus Quisqualis is maintained to accommodate selected African, Indian, Asian and Malesian species (including Q. indica L. and Q. parviflora Sond.). Diagnostic characters for Quisqualis include: leaves with abundant subepidermal crystalliferous idioblasts, each containing a large druse of calcium oxalate; leaves, stems and flowers with stalked glands but no scales; persistent petiole bases that develop into curved spines; petals well developed; hypanthium tubular or cylindrical, usually longer than 20 mm; stamens and style not or scarcely exserted; style adnate to hypanthium for more than half its length. Quisqualis shares a number of morphological similarities with Combretum Loefl. subgen. Cacoucia (Aubl.) Exell Stace sect. Poivrea (Comm. ex DC.) G.Don. Some species of Combretaceae from West, West Central and East Africa have the style adnate to the upper hypanthium and display features reminiscent of both Quisqualis and Combretum. These species also have characters of their own and in the past were placed in different sections under Combretum. It is suggested that at least some of these species may be best classified in genera distinct from Combretum and Quisqualis, one of which is Campylogyne Hemsley. Combretum s.str. is defined on the basis of a combination of characters and includes species of which the upper hypanthium is variable in shape, but when tubular or cylindrical, then always shorter than 20 mm. Other diagnostic characters include: stamens exserted well beyond petals; style exserted and free, but when shortly adnate to upper hypanthium (only at the base or for a short distance), then stamens long-exserted. It is suggested that different pollination strategies have developed independently in the Combretum–Quisqualis clade, resulting in convergent morphological trends in floral morphology. These homoplasious similarities in floral morphology are at the root of the difficulties experienced to demarcate genera. An alternative classification is provided for those preferring to include the southern African Quisqualis parviflora under Combretum s. l. For this purpose, a new combination and name, Combretum sylvicola O.Maurin is provided. Quisqualis parviflora is confined to the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coastal regions and does not extend beyond this area as has been claimed by some. A comparative table to differentiate among four groups in Quisqualis and Combretum in Africa, as well as a photo of a herbarium specimen and a distribution map of Quisqualis parviflora, are provided.",

    "abstract": "Elephant were previously widespread in savanna and coastal systems of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), but were virtually extirpated by 1870. Over time, elephant have been reintroduced into their former range in KZN, but always onto small fenced systems (mean size 191.3 km2 ± 87.8 km2, median size 107.0 km2, range 14 km2 – 900 km2). These populations have increased rapidly (8.4% per annum), and although a number of populations are now being managed using contraception, the majority of the populations (66.7%, 14 out of 21) are stocked above the ‘preferred density’ as defined in their approved management plans, while others will soon exceed the preferred density. Vulture populations in KZN are small, declining and already at risk of extinction. In KZN, 94.2% of tree-nesting vulture nests occur in areas with elephant; this could increase to 99.5% in the near future if proposed land-use change takes place. Anthropogenic impacts in the broader landscape mean that there are limited opportunities for vultures to nest elsewhere, and we hypothesise that loss of suitable nesting habitat in existing areas, including through impact of elephant on large trees, could result in declines and even extirpation of these species as breeding residents. Given the demonstrated and potential impacts of elephants on large trees necessary for vulture nesting, it is essential that the role of protected areas and extensive wildlife systems for vultures be adequately taken into account when managing elephant populations. It is important that a precautionary and adaptive management approach is taken regarding management of elephant in areas important for vultures, at least until the ecological interactions between vultures, vegetation, elephant and other drivers are better understood, and until the willingness and ability to manage elephant numbers and impact according to the elephant management plans are demonstrated.",

Up-to-date knowledge of the country’s biodiversity is crucial to establish the baseline information needed for conservation and management actions.Objectives: The aim of this article was to present a list of terrestrial mammal species reported from Mozambique, based on primary occurrence data.Method: We integrated existing knowledge, from dispersed sources of biodiversity data: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility portal, natural history collections, survey reports and literature. Data were updated and manually curated. However, none of the specimens upon which occurrences are based was directly observed. To partly overcome this impediment, we developed a species selection process for specimen data. This process produced the country’s species checklist and an additional list of species with questionable occurrence in the country.Results: From the digital and non-digital sources, we compiled more than 17 000 records. The data integrated resulted in a total of 217 mammal species (representing 14 orders, 39 families and 133 genera) with supported occurrence in Mozambique and 23 species with questionable reported occurrence in the country.Conclusion: The diversity of species accounted for is considerable as more than 70% of species present in the southern African subregion are found in Mozambique. We consider that the current number of mammal species in Mozambique is still underestimated. The methodological approach for species selection for specimen data can be adapted to update species checklists of crucial importance to countries facing similar lack of knowledge regarding their biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Background: The effectiveness of invasive alien species management in South Africa, and elsewhere, can be mproved by ensuring there are strong links and feedbacks between science and management. The CAPE Invasive Alien Animals Working Group (CAPE IAAWG) was established in 2008 to enhance cooperation among stakeholders such as implementing agencies and researchers, and thereby improve the management of invasive animals in the Greater Cape Floristic Region.Objectives: In this article we highlight where and how the working group has advanced our understanding of research and the implementation of management objectives and consider the working group’s successes and failures.Methods: We analyse the attendance of meetings by different stakeholders and the frequency of discussion topics on meeting agendas throughout the sequence of meetings from 2008 to 2019. We document insights based on published accounts or the experiences of the authors from eight different management projects.Results: Meetings are attended by stakeholders from NGOs, universities, and local, provincial and national government agencies as well as private individuals. Topics of discussion ranged from details of specific alien animal invasions (e.g. the House Crow in Cape Town), to considering the risks posed by broad groups (e.g. earthworms), to specific management techniques (e.g. guidelines for trapping invasive alien birds). Through the eight projects described here the CAPE IAAWG has: (i) contributed to capacity building through funding and advising on post-graduate research projects; (ii) provided ad hoc support to staff of agencies that implement invasive alien animal control; (iii) acted as a focal point for a community of practice that is supportive of decision making and policy development; and (iv) played a vital role in linking research, management and policy in a manner accessible to a broader range of stakeholders. The projects undertaken by the group reveal several lessons for managing invasive animals: (i) the importance of logistics and contract efficiency, (ii) the need for effective stakeholder engagement by the project team, (iii) the need to effectively address conflicts between role players, and (iv) the importance of including ethical and animal rights considerations in the decision making processes.Conclusion: The CAPE IAAWG has been a valuable forum to improve management effectiveness and support implementation decisions. Due to its small cost and time footprint, the working group has remained viable and retained a core of committed members, ensuring ongoing institutional buy-in. The working group will remain successful so long as the group is supported by its members and their organisations.",

The genus is most closely associated with a region of high floral endemism and biodiversity, the Succulent Karoo biome in south-western Africa.Objectives: To examine the distribution of Conophytum in south-western Namibia and in the Northern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa.Method: A database comprising 2798 locality records representing all known species and subspecies of the genus Conophytum has been constructed.Results: The genus is primarily restricted to the arid winter-rainfall region of the Northern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa and south-western Namibia, within the Greater Cape Floristic Region. Whilst taxa are found across all the main biomes in the region (the Succulent Karoo, Nama Karoo, Desert and Fynbos biomes), 94% of Conophytum taxa are found only in the Succulent Karoo biome and predominantly (88% of taxa) within South Africa. Endemism within specific bioregions is a feature of the genus and ~60% of taxa are endemic to the Succulent Karoo. Approximately 28% of all taxa could be considered point endemics. Whilst the genus has a relatively wide geographical range, we identify a pronounced centre of endemism in the southern Richtersveld.Conclusion: The genus Conophytum can be used as a good botanical model for studying patterns of diversity and speciation in the Succulent Karoo biome, the effects of climate change on dwarf succulents, and for informing conservation planning efforts.",

Traditional messages from the biodiversity sector are often framed around threat, with a generally pessimistic tone. Aspects of social marketing can be used to support positive messaging that is more likely to inspire action amongst the target audience.Objectives: The South African biodiversity sector embarked on a market research process to better understand the target audiences for its messages and develop a communications strategy that would reposition biodiversity as integral to the development trajectory of South Africa.Method: The market research process combined stakeholder analysis, market research, engagement and facilitated dialogue. Eight concept messages were developed that framed biodiversity communications in different ways. These messages were tested with the target audience to assess which were most relevant in a developing-world context.Results: The communications message that received the highest ranking in the market research process was the concept of biodiversity as a ‘national asset’. This frame places biodiversity as an equivalent national priority to other economic and social imperatives. Other messages that ranked highly were the emotional message of biodiversity as ‘our children’s legacy’ and the action-based ‘practical solutions’.Conclusion: Based on the findings, a communications strategy known as ‘Making the case for biodiversity’ was developed that re-framed the economic, emotional and practical value propositions for biodiversity. The communications strategy has already resulted in greater political and economic attention towards biodiversity in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Background and aim: The promotion of indigenous floral diversity would have a positive impact on ecosystem services and provide a source of additional income for local residents. Sesamum radiatum (Pedaliaceae) has great potential because it can provide a wide range of ornamental, ethnobotanical and nutritional services. Genetic studies are advocated before the increased introduction of a species into green spaces. Therefore, we aimed to study genetic diversity and differentiation among both disjunct and geographically close populations of S. radiatum in Gabon and Cameroon, to better manage indigenous genetic resources. Methods: Thirteen autochthonous populations of S. radiatum from two disjunct savanna areas of southeastern Gabon and northern Cameroon, separated by rain forest, were analysed using a highly reproducible high annealing temperature-random amplified polymorphic (HAT-RAPD) protocol. Genetic differentiation was assessed using distance-based and Bayesian approaches. Results and conclusion: The observed values of genetic differentiation between populations varied considerably (FST 0.041 to 0.706), with the majority found in the very high genetic differentiation range. Only two major genetic clusters were identified, mostly coinciding with geographic sampling areas. One of the populations from Cameroon showed signs of admixture possibly due to more intense agricultural activities in the area. The genetic differentiation among geographically close populations in Gabon is weak and most likely due to indigenous anthropogenic activities in connection with the traditional use of S. radiatum. Thus, the production and dissemination of planting material used, for instance, for green space development should take place within the main clusters in order not to distort the existing genetic structure, while benefiting from sufficient genetic diversity within the regions themselves.

    "abstract": "Wetlands in natural areas in South Africa have been described before, but no literature exists concerning the phyto­sociology of urban wetlands. The objective of this study was to conduct a complete vegetation analysis of the wetlands in the Potchefstroom Municipal Area. Using a numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) as a first approximation, the classification was refined by using Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table from which a number of unique plant communities are recognised. These urban wetlands are characterised by a high species diversity, which is unusual for wetlands. Reasons for the high species diversity could be the different types of disturbances occurring in this area. Results of this study can be used to construact more sensible management practises for these wetlands.",

The number of species and their degree of endemism decrease from south to north. Several regions, e.g. Zimbabwe and West Africa, are outliers of other regions, or overlap zones between regions. An attempt is made to determine the history of the group by vicariance biogeographical analysis, but the resultant area cladogram is uninformative. This may be due to the vagility of the taxa.Areas of endemism of supra-specific taxa are determined. These areas appear on recent palaeoenvironmental data to be possible refugia (Cape fold mountains, the South African Drakensberg and the East African Rift Valley mountains), from where the taxa spread when the climate ameliorated after the last glacial. This model is corroborated by recent studies on Cupressaceae, Pooidae and Compositae.",

High species diversity corresponds with zones where species overlap. These are particularly obvious where there are altitudinal variations and in high-lying areas. The endemic flora of Namibia is rich and diverse. An estimated 16% of the total plant species in Namibia are endemic to the country. Endemics are in a wide variety of families and sixteen genera are endemic. Factors that increase the likelihood of endemism are mountains, hot deserts, diversity of substrates and microclimates. The distribution of plants endemic to Namibia was arranged in three different ways. Firstly, based on a grid count with the phytogeographic value o f the species being equal, overall endemism was mapped. Secondly, range restricted plant species were mapped individually and those with congruent distribution patterns were combined. Thirdly, localities that are important for very range-restricted species were identified. The resulting maps o f endemism and diversity were compared and found to correspond in many localities. When overall endemism is compared with overall diversity, rich localities may consist of endemic species with wide ranges. The other methods identify important localities with their own distinctive complement of species.",

The Reserve is covered in near-natural fynbos shrublands with a few patches of forest and wetland. The main objective of this study was to classify the vegetation into discrete units and relate them to the prevailing environmental conditions. The vegetation was analysed by numerical means (TWINSPAN, DC A, CCA) and mapped on GIS. At the vegetation type level. Forest Thicket and Fynbos formed distinctive clusters, whereas the wetland releves were intermixed, but without relationships to one of these units. Fire incidence served as the major determinant of the forest-fynbos boundary. The Forest Thicket grouping was separated into Thicket (as transitional to fynbos), Afromontane Forest and Milkwood Scrub Forest. Two broad complexes were distinguished within the Fynbos grouping, the Alkaline Sand Fynbos Complex corresponding to Coastal Fynbos. and the Acid Sand Fynbos Complex corresponding to Mountain Fynbos. They discriminated along gradients of pH. soil depth and rock cover. The complexes were further subdivided into formations by using one or a few subjectively chosen dominant species as indicators. The transitions between these formations were rather continuous than discrete. The vegetation type and complex levels correspond well to existing fynbos-wide classifications. Comparing the formations to the results of other vegetation studies is problematic even on the scale of the Agulhas Plain, due to the high regional plant diversity in the Fynbos Biome.",

Moraea tanquana, from the Tankwa River Basin in Northern Cape, resembles the southern Namaqualand M. deserticola but has broad, plane leaves, short anthers exserted from a shallower floral cup and a short style. In section Acaules, M. longipes from Namaqualand stands out in its early flowering habit, a stem consisting of a single long intemode reaching well above the ground, short style and unusually long anthers. Moraea jarmilae described from Ox Bow, Lesotho in 2002, is conspecific with M. albicuspa and is reduced to synonymy.

    "abstract": "The native and naturalized species of Fumariaceae in southern Africa are reviewed, and keys and full descriptions are provided. All relevant regional synonyms are given and the indigenous species are illustrated. Three native genera with four species are recognized. The previously taxonomically unplaced genus Cysticapnos Mill. (3 spp.) is included with two other monotypic native South African genera, Discocapnos Cham. Schltdl. and Trigonocapnos Schltr., in an enlarged circum­scription of subtribe Discocapninae, which is morphologically defined by tendrilliferous leaves and mostly sessile racemes with the lowermost flower basal. Two subspecies are recognized in Cysticapnos vesicaria (E.Mey. ex Bemh.) Lidén, subsp. vesicaria with fewer, smaller flowers and subsp. namaquensis J.C.Manning Goldblatt for plants from Namaqualand with more numerous, often larger flowers. C. parviflora Lidén appears to be nothing more than a dwarf-fruited form of C. vesicaria, in which heterocarpy has long been known. C. pruinosa (E.Mey. ex Bemh.) Lidén is recorded for the first time to be a short-lived perennial and not an annual, thus unique in the tribe Fumarieae. Discocapnos mundii var. dregei Harv. from the southern Cape is treated as subsp. dregei (Harv.) J.C.Manning Goldblatt on account of its slightly smaller fruits and significant geographical disjunction from subsp. mundii. Three introduced species are included, Fumaria capreolata L., F. muralis Sond. ex W.D.Koch subsp. muralis and F. parviflora Lam. var. parviflora, although only the last two appear to be truly naturalized.",

    "abstract": "Field work during the past 15 years has resulted in the discovery of 12 new species of the western southern African genus Geissorhiza Ker Gawl. and range extensions for several more. Following a survey of pollen morphology in the genus, we describe new pollen types in one section each of the two subgenera: five species of section Ciliatae Goldblatt and two of section Weihea Eckl. ex Baker have more complex apertures than the plesiomorphic single aperture with a 2-banded oper­culum found in other species. In addition, populations currently referred to the typical white (cream)-flowered G. inflexa (D.Delaroche) Goldblatt with larger, pink, red or purple flowers, have a third pollen type and are recognized as G. erosa (Salisb.) R.C.Foster. The new species are G. altimontana from the high Langeberg near Grootvadersbos; G. helmei from the Piketberg; G. lupidosa from the Du Toits Kloof Mtns; G. monticola from the Swartberg; G. platystigma from Darling, north of Cape Town; G. sufflava from the Piketberg; G. tricolor from Riversdale (all subgenus Weihea (Eckl. ex Baker) Goldblatt); and G. cantharophila from the Klein Roggeveld; G. demissa from the Kamiesberg. Gitberg and Cold Bokkeveld; G. exilis from the Waaihoek Mtns in the Worcester District; G. reclinata from the Swartberg: and G. saxicola from the northern Cedarberg-Pakhuis Mountain complex (all subgenus Geissorhiza). We also report range extensions and provide morphological notes for several species, including G. monanthos Eckl.. new collections o f w hich show that the inclusion of G. leuisiae R.C.Foster in that species was incorrect and we resurrect the species. The addition of 12 new species and recognition of G. erosa and G. lewisiae bring to 99 the number of species in the genus. New identification keys for Geissorhiza are provided that include all new species. We have also accumulated observations of floral ecology in the genus and integrate them with what is known about this aspect of the biology of Geissorhiza. Unusual strategies include deceptive pollination in G. tulhagh- ensis F.Bolus by tabanid flies and in two species, pollination using empid flies in combination w ith halictid bees",

The VEGMAP has been updated twice, in 2009 and 2012, since its first release in 2006.Objectives: The first objective is to report on the motivations for changes in the 2009 and 2012 versions. The second objective is to describe new vegetation types and subtypes included in these versions.Method: Changes to the VEGMAP are implemented after a peer-review process that is managed by the National Vegetation Map Committee. Accepted changes are then incorporated into the VEGMAP using GIS software.Results: Seventy-one of the 449 vegetation types were affected by updates. Changes included the addition of new vegetation types and subtypes, modifications to the boundaries of types present in the 2006 VEGMAP and changes to the names of vegetation types.Conclusion: The updates have affected a small portion of the map but have reflected a progressive refinement in quality. Regions that are still mapped at a coarse scale, especially those earmarked for land-use development, should be prioritised for improved map accuracy and classification through a more proactive approach towards vegetation mapping, using guidelines that are under development.",

    "abstract": "In 2008, South Africa adopted its ‘National Norms and Standards for the Management of Elephants in South Africa’. Concern has subsequently been raised as to whether these norms and standards apply to free-ranging elephant on land, which had not been enclosed with a fence with the express purpose of containing these animals and other game on the property. The application of these norms and standards pivots on whether the owner(s) of the property have taken possession of these animals in accordance with common law applicable to game, or have given effect to the provisions of the Game Theft Act. To address this concern, this article briefly explores the evolution of South African regulatory jurisprudence applicable to game, including elephant, and analyses the norms and standards in relation to international and national legislation and common law applying to elephants. The norms and standards are not applicable to unowned, free-roaming elephant. These norms and standards, therefore, do not fulfil their primary objective of uniform management of elephant across South Africa. This limitation of the norms and standards, therefore, needs to be considered when they are revised.",

    "abstract": "Background: Urban vegetation studies have, until recently, been relatively uncommon in South Africa. Yet, natural urban vegetation is constantly competing with and greatly impacted by urbanisation. This vegetation requires proper management and needs to be conserved because it is an important ecological infrastructure.Objectives: The objectives of the study were to identify the main vegetation types within the urban open spaces in the Bloemfontein metropolitan area, and to determine the floristic composition and species diversity of the area.Methods: A total of 248 relevés were classified using the TWINSPAN classification algorithm, and relationships between the communities and the environment were determined with the Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis computer programs. Species diversity was partitioned into α-, β- and γ-diversities.Results: Within the study area, 77 plant families and 248 genera, with a total of 376 plant species, were identified. The largest families are Poaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae, whereas the largest genera are Eragrostis, Aristida, Cyperus, Asparagus and Senecio. The study area has high species richness and the most species-rich sites are found adjacent to rivers and streams, and also on the slopes of hills and ridges. The vegetation is classified under five major vegetation types and four sub-units, which show a distinct association with topography and soil texture.Conclusion: The urban vegetation of Bloemfontein is species-rich and should be properly managed and conserved. In particular, the wetlands and rocky outcrops on hills and ridges, which are the most threatened habitats in the study area, need special management.",

    "abstract": "Background: Low altitude Mopaneveld savanna in the northeastern parts of South Africa is generally well conserved. However, extensive copper mining, agricultural practices and urbanisation in the Phalaborwa region prompted research on the possible effects of land-use change on plant community diversity and function. Species diversity measures are usually considered adequate to assess disturbance effects to inform conservation efforts and management practices. However, diversity measures based on species level accounts often limit the outcomes of these studies as this approach fails to quantify how disturbances affect ecosystem functioning when community assembly, and not species diversity alone, is altered by land-use change.Objectives: The aim of this study was to apply both species and functional diversity measures to a data set derived from various land-use types (i.e. areas exposed to strip mining activities, communal farming practices and conservation) in the Phalaborwa region to examine the effects of land-use change on the community ecology of the herbaceous layer.Results: Land-use change, particularly severe top-soil disturbances through strip mining activities, had a significant filtering effect on all measures of species diversity, though functional evenness was maintained across land-use types.Conclusion: These results suggest that, despite initial species loss, this particular savanna ecosystem is buffered against anthropogenic disturbances through functional stability. Indicator species analyses, as well as relationships between plant functional types and land-use change, revealed that forb species are largely responsible for ecosystem stability in areas exposed to anthropogenic disturbances.",

Pitfall trapping is a commonly used passive sampling method, and bush beating, aerial hand collection above the knee, aerial hand collection below the knee cryptic and non-cryptic are widely used active sampling techniques. Objective and method: Pitfall traps and four active sampling techniques were used in a Chromolaena odorata invaded site to compare the methods used in sampling arthropods in Buffelsdraai Conservancy outside the city of Durban, South Africa. Results: Pitfall traps were the most efficient and the most effective sampling technique with high species richness for both the ant (78%) and spider (76%) samples. One explanation for these differences could be the longer sampling time for passive sampling compared to active sampling. Conclusion: Compared to the subjective identification of species by collectors in active techniques, the non-selective capturing of species by pitfall traps improves its efficiency. The fewest taxa and individuals were collected by aerial hand collection techniques but these techniques are recommended to supplement pitfall traps. The combination of methods allows for the adequate sampling of the various strata found in vegetatively complex sites. An investigation into the possible use of canopy techniques in C. odorata sites would be beneficial, as it considers the various vegetation strata when sampling for biodiversity.",

Its chromosome number, multicellular glands, two florets per spikelet, type of palea and rachilla extension relate it more closely to Pentaschistis than to any other extant arundinoid genus.

[= Arundinaria tessellata (Nees) Munro] is the only endemic South African bamboo and occurs from the eastern districts of the Cape, through Lesotho and Natal, to the eastern Orange Free State at elevations of about 1 500-2 500 m. The Mountain Bamboo, or‘Bergbamboes’ was first described by Nees in 1841 as a member of the genus Nastus because of the similarity, tohim, of the spikelets between it and N. borbonicus, but was later transferred to the all-encompassing genus of the time, Arundinaria, the type species of which is endemic to the south-eastern United States of America. Based onour present knowledge of bamboo genera, this South African species may be excluded from Nastus because the inflorescence is not a panicle but bracteate racemiform, the vegetative branches do not arise in a verticillate manner but are a series of subequal branches that are borne in a row above the nodal line and T. tessellatus has anandroecium of three stamens and not six as in Nastus. The Bergbamboes, with sympodial rhizomes and branchcomplement of several subequal branches, can also not be maintained in Arundinaria, for monopodial rhizomesand a single branch at the node are typical of this genus. The simple, ebracteate, and exserted inflorescence ofArundinaria is also quite distinct from that of the Bergbamboes. In order to place the South African bamboo more precisely we have made comparative studies of its leaf anatomy and epidermis, gross morphology, and analyses of its inflorescence and spikelets. The results of all thesestudies reveal a striking resemblance to members of the Sino-Himalayan genus, Thamnocalamus, to which we haveaccordingly transferred the species. The results are presented, together with an interpretation of the phylogeneticposition of the Bergbamboes and possible events that led to the disjunction of species in the genus.",

Most species in the seed bank flora were either grasses, sedges, or forbs, with hardly any evidence of woody species. The Licuati forest and thicket soils produced the lowest seed densities in all seasons. Licuati forest and grassland seed banks showed a two-fold seasonal variation in size, those of the Licuati thicket and woodland a three-fold variation in size, whereas the forest/grassland ecotone maintained a relatively large seed bank all year round. The woodland seed bank had the highest species richness, whereas the Licuati forest and thicket soils were poor in species.

These three genera include all native African species of Onagraceae. Four sections of Ludwigia, cornprising a total of five species, and one fairly distinctive group of Epilobium are the most characteristic African groups. Despite the fact that H. Perrier de la Bathie (in Humb., FI. Madagasc., Oenotheracs : 1-26, 1950) considered all three of the species of Epilobium that he recognized and four of the 11 species of Ludwigia (including Jussiaea) to be endemic to Madagascar, there are in my opinion no Mascarene endemics in the family Onagraceae and nothing to suggest any great antiquity for the family on that island. This observation agrees with the general pattern for the family in Africa in suggesting that plants of this family are relatively recent arrivals on that continent. Indeed this generality could be extended to apply to the Old World as a whole, where there is no endemic genus of the family (as opposed to 16 endemic genera and 2 endemic tribes—Lopezieae and Onagreae—in the New World, principally in Mexico and the western United States) and relatively few endemic sections or subgenera.

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of South African biodiversity occurs in extensive private wildlife areas. As such, the continuance of these private reserves is paramount to conservation of the country’s biodiversity. The areas are, however, vulnerable to being divided into smaller camps as landowners enter into the new and rapidly growing industry of selective breeding and intensive management of antelope and predators. Concerns are being raised as to the long-term consequences of the products and impacts of this industry on, inter alia, integrity and conservation of the country’s wildlife, and the landscapes these facilities are located in, as well as the country’s reputation as a free ranging and fair chase hunting destination. Using the public trust doctrine as a foundation, this article characterises the relationship between the country’s environmental law and the roles played by government as the regulator, the wildlife industry, research and the public in achieving responsible wildlife management and the long-term conservation of this resource. These relationships are seen to be finely balanced between the provision of robust science, and evidence-based and cautious or risk-averse decision-making. It is concluded that the public trust doctrine is a powerful tool to limit the impacts of unsustainable and parochial use of wildlife on the conservation of biodiversity. It is also concluded that an improved understanding of the doctrine by researchers, public and the wildlife industry would lead to a greater relevance of research, and in turn sound evidence-based decision-making and ultimately sustainable use of wildlife.",

Objectives: Sixteen naturalised ornamentals in Cape Town were assessed for invasion potential in relation to a mechanistic framework. The recently spreading species, Centranthus ruber (L.) DC., was studied in detail following management actions and vegetation fires. Method: The mechanistic framework was developed using nine features most likely to promote invasiveness. Species were assessed from their known characteristics, local usage and distribution records, including citizen science surveys. Surveys were conducted for C. ruber to assess its ability to survive and spread post-fire. Control efficacy for Centranthus ruber was assessed in plots at two sites. Results: Nine species with more than 25 naturalisation records had a median of seven features that promote invasion compared to five features in the less recorded group of seven species. Centranthus ruber was widespread in modified urban habitats and persisted in natural habitats following vegetation fires and is a high priority for control. Post-fire mechanical and chemical control of C. ruber significantly reduced its density and cover, but did not eliminate it. Conclusion: Naturalised ornamentals can move rapidly from latent to invasive phases; therefore, monitoring should start during the latent phase to detect sudden change. In firedriven ecosystems it is essential to have good pre-fire baseline data. More residents should be encouraged to become spotters through citizen science programmes and to report new naturalised ornamentals. It is important to act early in the invasion process and to allocate sufficient resources, if a newly invasive species is to be contained.",

Despite many advantages of this technique, the delay between defaecation, sample collection and processing may influence steroid concentrations, as faecal bacterial enzymes can alter steroid composition post-defaecation.Objectives: This study investigated changes in faecal glucocorticoid (fGCM), androgen (fAM) and progestagen (fPM) metabolite concentrations in faeces of a male and female African elephant (Loxodonta africana) post-defaecation and the influence of different faeces-drying regimes.Method: Subsamples of fresh faeces were frozen after being dried in direct sun or shade for 6, 20, 24, 48 and 72 h and 7 and 34 days. A subset of samples for each sex was immediately frozen as controls. Faecal hormone metabolite concentrations were determined using enzyme immunoassays established for fGCM, fAM and fPM monitoring in male and female African elephants.Results: Hormone metabolite concentrations of all three steroid classes were stable at first, but changed distinctively after 20 h post-defaecation, with fGCM concentrations decreasing over time and fPM and fAM concentrations steadily increasing. In freeze-dried faeces fGCM concentrations were significantly higher than respective concentrations in sun-dried material, which were in turn significantly higher than fGCM concentrations in shade-dried material. In contrast, fAM concentrations were significantly higher in sun- and shade-dried faeces compared to freeze-dried faeces. Higher fPM concentrations were also found in air-dried samples compared to lyophilised faeces, but the effect was only significant for sun-dried material.Conclusion: The revealed time restriction for collecting faecal material for hormone monitoring from elephants in the wild should be taken into account to assure reliable and comparable results. However, if logistics allow a timely collection, non-invasive hormone measurement remains a powerful and reliable approach to provide information about an elephant’s endocrine status.",

Property ownership and extent were mapped based on title deed searches and analysis of property grants. Implications of land transformation on biodiversity integrity and hydrological functioning were determined according to an expert approach using the analytic hierarchy process.Results: More than half (54%) of the natural grassland area has been transformed to commercial timber plantations (427% increase) and commercial agricultural cropping (311% increase). Loss of grassland in the Karkloof catchment is considered to be representative of the general trend in the moist eastern portion of the Grassland Biome of South Africa. Both combined forest and woodland and areas of dense alien vegetation increased (26% and 397%, respectively), whereas the area under subsistence cultivation decreased (98%). Land ownership has changed from private individuals to private business entities (31%) and corporate forestry (26%). Biodiversity integrity of the catchment is estimated to have decreased by 326% and hydrological functioning for the support of aquatic biodiversity by 166%.Conclusion: Continued pressure to change patterns of ownership and land use is expected. This is likely to occur within the global context of climate change, population growth and shortages of land and its products. Immense pressure on the land areas, and specifically water services and biodiversity, is likely to occur, with associated environmental impacts.",

Species richness of woody plants and vines of the Kouga-Baviaanskloof Forests was higher than in the western mountain complexes, where species richness in the more southern Rooiberg and Kamanassie Mountains was higher than in the Swartberg range. The Rooiberg, a dry mountain with small forests far away from the coastal source area, had more species than, and contained many species which are absent from, the larger, moister forests of the Kamanassie which are closest to the coastal source areas. Neither altitude nor distance from the source area, the forests south of the coastal mountains, nor long-distance dispersal, adequately explained the variation in species richness. The variations are best explained in terms of dispersal corridors along the Gouritz and Gamtoos River systems which connect the coastal forests with the inland mountains. The distribution patterns of four species groups in relation to the geomorphological history of the two river systems provide relative dates for the expansion and contraction of temperate forest, subtropical forest and subtropical transitional thicket in the southern Cape.",

    "abstract": "Africa (including Madagascar) has nearly twice as many species of Commelinaceae as any other continent (approximately 270 species, or about 40% of the total in the family). Of the 17 genera which are native, seven (Anthericopsis, Coleotrype, Palisota, Polyspatha, Pseudoparis, Stanfieldiella and Triceratella) are endemic, the highest percentage generic endemism of any continent. Within Africa gcneric diversity is slightly higher in western than in eastern tropical floras. Species richness, however, is greatest in eastern Africa, mainly due to a high diversity of species of Commelina and Aneilema. Africa shares more genera with Asia (nine) than with any other continent. Only one African genus, Buforrestia, is neither endemic nor shared with Asia. Its western African/northeastern South American distribution is unique in the family. Besides Buforrestia, only five other genera of Commelinaceae (out of a total of 50 in the family), occur in both the Old and New Worlds. These genera. Aneilema, Commelina, Floscopa, Murdannia and Pollia are all very widespread in the Old World, occurring in Australia and Asia in addition to Africa (both continental and Madagascar). Madagascar is relatively poor in species (31). but these include the endemic Madagascan genus Pseudoparis, the sole African species of Rhopalephora, and the largest number of species of the Afro-Malagasy endemic genus Coleotrype. The high rate of generic endemism of Commelinaceae in Africa probably indicates that Africa was one of the ancient centres of diversity for the family. The high species diversity is more likely due to relatively recent radiations by genera pre-adapted to survival in non-forest habitats. The occurrence of only a small number of genera on both sides of the Atlantic suggests that the Commelinaceae have been evolving independently in the eastern and western hemispheres for a long period.",

    "abstract": "Domestication of a South African group of Proteaceae, the proteas, began with their cultivation as exotics in Europe. A growing local interest in their cultivation climaxed in the publication of a popular handbook in 1958. Commercial interest in cultivation and seed sources was stimulated and led to a botanical and horticultural survey of useful species throughout their distribution range in the fynbos. Information pamphlets on cultivation requirements and seed were eventually supplied to the public as an official service. Up to 1970 cut-flowers were harvested in limited quantities, mainly from the western Cape folded mountains, and sold on the European markets. During the last decade, the export trade in fresh Proteaceae flowers has become a significant factor in the national economy. However, the original system of harvesting from the natural habitat has caused serious marketing problems, for instance, poor cut-flower quality and an erratic supply of many species. Increased exploitation has also led to unprecedented disruptive pressure on the fynbos biome system, particularly on the Proteaceae-component. It is clear that the scientific cultivation of the protea family as a floricultural crop is necessary' for its sustained growth as an economic factor, as well as for its natural conservation. The present paper gives an overview of the developments that led to the rise of the fynbos Proteaceae as a commercially cultivated crop in South Africa.",

Several trends in starch grain morphology and triterpene composition were evident in the 38 examined taxa. Rod shaped grains, interpreted to be conservative, occurred in only a few taxa in several dwarf groups. Grains of osteoid shape prevailed in most taxa. Highly osteoid grains possessing lobed ends represented the most complex form and were present in some taxa endemic to Madagascar. Triterpene profiles which contained from 2 to 14 or more compounds were derived from all taxa. Each taxon possessed a characteristic profile, or identifying fingerprint. The composition of the profile differed quantitatively and qualitatively among taxa. Taxa with few triterpenes, tentatively interpreted as primitive, occurred in dwarf forms, whereas Madagascan taxa tended to possess high numbers of triterpenes reflective of specialization. This study supports the interpretation that laticifer starch grain morphology and triterpene composition, both gene mediated stable markers, can be employed to determine and correlate phylogenetic relationships between taxa of this complex genus.",

Characters of the corm coverings are used to divide Spiloxene into six groups. Four leaf forms are recognised namely carinate, terete, canaliculate and plicate. Multicellular processes and unicellular hairs occur occasionally.The leaf stomata are paracytic. Most species have mucilage canals containing pectic compounds of mucopoly­saccharides. The vascular bundles have complete or incomplete bundle sheaths and larger bundles have sclerenchyma caps.",

Hesperantha longistyla J.C.Manning Goldblatt. known from one collection from the mountains of SW Namibia, is a dwarf plant with moderately long-tubed, purple flowers and unusually long style branches, possibly allied to the Kamiesberg species, H. latifolia. A second species, H. helmei Goldblatt J.C.Manning, also known from a single collection from the interior mountains of Eastern Cape near Graaff- Reinet, has terete leaves and small flowers with tepals ± 8 x 2.5 mm, about as long as the perianth tube. It is apparently most closely allied to the Roggeveld species, H. cliolata. A third novelty, H. lithicola J.C.Manning Goldblatt. restricted to the Swartruggens range in the eastern Cold Bokkeveld, has bell-shaped corms with toothed margins, leaves 1-2 mm wide, and white flowers with a tube 10-12 mm long, and appears most closely allied to the widespread H. falcata. A new collection of H karooica from northeast of the Hantamsberg represents a small but significant range extension for this local endemic previously known from just two collections near Calvinia, south of these mountains. The flower size, especially dimensions of the tepals, confirms its status as a separate species allied to H. vaginata. Lastly, new collections o f the relatively uncommon, yellow-flowered variant of H. acuta show that this plant, confined to the eastem portion of the range of the species, differs consistently from the white-flowered form in several floral features, and it is raised to subspecies rank as H. acuta subsp. tugwelliae.",

In the PCA, each of the above groups was defined by two stand noda, each nodum representing a plant community that could be observed in the field.

The microstructures formed in culture and oxidase reactions of the cultures were compared with the microstructures present, the construction and type of decay of the carpophores from which they were made. Fhe type of interfertility of seven species was determined. Intercollection pairings of haploid mycelia derived from single basidiospores and the technique of dikaryotizing a large haploid mycelium growing in culture by pairing it with a small dikaryotic mycelium, were used to confirm the identity of different collections of eight different species. The literature on the classification, structure and anatomy of the carpophores and pure culture studies of Hymenomycetes. was reviewed. It was found that the 24 species were distributed among nine of the groups proposed by Nobles (1958) on the basis of their cultural characters. TTie structures formed in culture were also found to be present in the carpophores so that the carpophores could also be assigned to the some groups as their cultures. The carpophores did not indicate the same relationships as the cultures however. Differences in the micromorphological characters of hyphae and in the types of hyphae present in carpophores of species in the same group were found. Differences in construction of the carpophores were noticed in species with similar types of hyphae. Micromorphological characters of hyphae and the microstructures as well as the construction of the carpophores are constant for each species. Differences and similarity of micromorphological characters and construction of carpophores of different species are not adequately conveyed by the concept of hyphal systems.",

    "abstract": "Background: Conservation relies on the strategic use of resources because monies for conservation action are limited, especially in developing countries. South Africa’s Frog Atlas project established a baseline for the country’s amphibian data and threat levels in 2004, and in 2009 a prioritisation exercise developed a strategy for conservation research.Objectives: In this article, we assess this strategy for conservation research.Method: We conducted a quantitative and qualitative assessment of research undertaken since the strategy was developed.Results: The strategy has produced a lasting impact on taxonomy, ecological studies, monitoring and capacity building. Publications in all areas have increased, but particularly in conservation ecology. Other indicators are increases in the numbers of locality records for target taxa, species descriptions and postgraduate degrees with amphibians as the principal topic. We document important milestones for South African amphibian conservation, including the first Biodiversity Management Plan for Species (BMP-S) for Hyperolius pickersgilli, a smart device app that uploads locality data to an open access database, 15 years of monitoring data and new amphibian identification books for adults and children. The Red List Index calculated for South African amphibians shows that the country’s species are becoming more threatened (a 1% reduction in 10 years), but a hindcasting exercise suggests that most of the damage was already done by 1990. We provide a checklist for 131 amphibian species in South Africa, of which 82 species are endemic.Conclusion: A strategy for conservation research was found to greatly augment the focus of research on South African frogs. A new strategy should focus on fewer taxa over meaningful time spans.",

    "abstract": "Background: Current distribution information on cacti in the Tugela River basin in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is scant. Accordingly, surveys in this region substantially improve our understanding of regional invasions by this succulent group. The identification of new or extended invasions requires (re)assessments of their invasion status and consideration of possible management interventions.Objectives: To identify and collect cacti either not previously recorded or poorly known in the central Tugela River basin, and to assess their invasion status.Method: A 40 km section of tertiary road was travelled through the topocadastral square 2830 CC, from the R74 main road northward across the Bloukrans River towards the Tugela River. Herbarium specimens were collected to vouch for new instances of naturalisation of cacti, the colony sizes of which were estimated and invasion stages determined. An applicable weed risk assessment model was used to determine the threat status of one cactus species not previously evaluated for South Africa. Based on the South African Plant Invaders Atlas database records and field observations, management recommendations were suggested for six cacti species.Results: The first naturalised population of Opuntia microdasys in KwaZulu-Natal was detected, as was the first confirmed South African record of Echinopsis oxygona. Four populations of Peniocereus serpentinus were also found, ranging in size from several square metres to 0.4 ha. Echinopsis oxygona generated a score that falls into the reject category of the risk assessment model used.Conclusion: It is recommended that E. oxygona be added to the Species Under Surveillance for Possible Eradication or Containment Targeting list to investigate whether this species requires formal legal listing and the development of a specific eradication plan. Immediate action from local authorities is recommended for the manual removal of P. serpentinus and O. microdasys populations.",

Emphasis was placed on the fynbos shrublands and sample sites were subjectively located along a transect from south to north across the Langeberg range in the study area. This south to north orientation follows a complex gradient of changes in aspect, slope, geology, soil form and climate. Data were initially analysed using TWINSPAN and the resulting classification refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures. One forest subassociation and 12 fynbos communities were identified and described. A proposed hierarchical classification of the fynbos communities is presented.",

It was possible to locate and estimate P. australis areas for 1957 (0,74 ha), 1965 (1,65 ha), 1969 (1,93 ha) and 1976 (2,94 ha). Phragmites australis first inhabited the shores of the middle section o f the lagoon followed by rapid expansion in the lower section. The upper section was colonized only at its lower end by expansion from the middle section. It is suggested that P. australis was unsuccessful in this section because of competition by the Hibiscus tiliaceus—Barringtonia racemosa Lagoon Fringe Forest. This same community is shading out P. australis in some places. The notable increase in the rate of advance of land and littoral vegetation into the Siyai Lagoon was caused by sugar farming activities leading to erosion and sedimentation in the lagoon. A vegetation age gradient was observed from the upper section to the mouth region. The colonization of most of the Siyai Lagoon except the immediate mouth zone by P. australis Reedswamp and Hibiscus tiliaceus—Barringtonia racemosa Lagoon Fringe Forest, can be expected before the turn of the century. Dredging and mechanical control of vegetation will become necessary if major open water spaces are to be maintained.",

In the Combretaceae EFNs are reported in species of Terminalia L. and Pteleopsis Engl., putative EFNs in Meiostemon Exell Stace and Quisqualis L., and an absence of EFNs in Combretum Loefl. and Lumnitzera Willd. EFNs in the family are generally spherical in shape and may be raised, level with the surface or somewhat concave. They are similar in the Terminalia and Pteleopsis species where they display varying degrees of internal zonation and are composed of small cells; those species observed in the field were all found to have functional EFNs. In Meiostemon tetrandrum (Exell) Exell Stace, Quisqualis indica L.. Q. littorea (Engl.) Exell and Q. paviflora Gerrard ex Sond.. apparent EFNs lack internal zonation and are composed of enlarged cells; confirmation is required as to whether these are functional . The formation of EFNs appears to be highly flexible. They are usually essentially associated with new growth but their occurrence is sporadic and they do not appear on every leaf or every' branch of a plant. The distribution of EFNs on leaves, when present, is of taxonomic significance to separate species of Pteleopsis and Terminalia: otherwise the presence or absence and distribution of EFNs are too variable and sporadic in occurrence to be of taxonomic significance at the species level. Indiscriminate use of the terms gland and domatium instead of EFN. and possible confusion with damage caused by other organisms, has probably con­tributed to many of these structures not previously being recorded as EFNs. Floral and extrafloral nectar samples of T. phanerophlebia Engl. Diels differed in sugar composition.",

Wellstedia comprises six species, five in Socotra, Somalia and Ethiopia with the remaining one. W. dinteri Pilg.. occurring in southern Africa. W dinteri Pilg. subsp. dinteri occurs in Namibia and the Northern Cape, whereas the newly instated subspecies W. dinteri subsp. gracilior (D.R.Hunt) Retief A.E.van Wyk, based on W. dinteri Pilg. var. gracilior D.R.Hunt, is confined to Namibia only. The disjunct distribution of Wellstedia and numerous other plant and animal taxa between the arid regions of northeastern Africa and southern Africa is usually explained by the postulated periodic existence of an arid corridor between the two regions during the arid phases of the Pleistocene and even earlier. Wellstedia is treated here in Wellstedioideae, a subfamily of Boraginaceae s.I. but is sometimes placed in a family of its own, Wellstediaceae Pilger. Morphologically Wellstedia displays strong similarity to genera of the Ehretioideae and also to certain members of the Hydrophyllaceae. The genus is characterized by a perennial, dwarf shrub habit, densely hairy leaves. 4-merous flowers, a terminal, bifid style and a 1- or 2-seeded capsule.

Specimens of a species of Isoglossa were collected from wild subpopulations from the Hartebeespoort Dam and Hartebeeshoek areas, at intervals over a season. Leaves and inflorescences were measured, and frequencies of hair types on bracts and calyces were recorded photographically Results indicate that leaf size within a species increases over the vegetative phase of the plant and that inflorescence size within a species increases over the reproductive phase of the plant. Therefore, caution should be applied when these characters are used for species identification in Isoglossa. Bract and calyx indumenta also change over a season, thus making it necessary to use wisdom when applying this character taxonomically.",

This morphology is radically different from known pollen of the Campanulaceae s.sfr:: the Campanulaceae are treated here as a family separate from the Lobeliaceae, Cyphiaceae, Nemacladaceae, Pentaphragmataceae and Sphenocleaceae (Lammers 1992). As traditionally conceived, the Campanulaceae is very heterogeneous and, in many classifications, these families were treated as subfamilies of a much-enlarged Campanulaceae. The consistently different floral morphology, biochemistry and pollen structure of the Lobeliaceae favours the recognition of this predominantly tropical group as a separate family.The pollen grains of these species are described in comparison with other members of the Campanulaceae. Based on surface characteristics of their pollen grains, we conclude that they represent an early offshoot o f the wahlenbergioid line­age in southern Africa. We suggest that this unique pollen may also be the result of a highly selective regime in the fynbos, associated with specialized pollinators, and base-poor soils, in addition to possible adaptations for ant dispersal and fire. Rhigiophyllum Hochst. and Siphocodon Turcz. are also unique in having free carpel-like structures within the ovary. These shrink to form seed pockets around the seeds and disperse as units when the capsule matures. Data from molecular studies support the contention that these taxa form a sister group to all other wahlenbergioids and that this should be formally recognized in a classification system. We treat Rhigiophyllum and Siphocodon within the Campanulaceae: Wahlenbergioideae, as a separate tribe, the Rhigiophylleae tribus nov., the species of which are distinguishable from other wahlenbergioids by unique angulaperturatc pollen, epipetalous stamens, free carpel-like structures and seed pockets.",

Dispersal strategies in arid environments reflect these differences and many mechanisms have evolved that restrict or hinder dispersal. Myxospermy is a trait developed by plant species from arid regions to restrict diaspore dispersal by means of an anchorage mechanism. Several of the abundant plant species in Namaqualand, within the arid Succulent Karoo Biome, display myxospermy. Diaspores of these species produce copious amounts of mucilage when they are moistened and are anchored to the soil once the mucilage dries out again. This study investigated the origin of the mucilaginous layer of 12 species anatomically, using both light and scanning electron microscopy. The mucilage production of the species investigated could best be grouped into three types: 1, epidermal and sub-epidermal cells of seeds and achenes; 2, specialized tissue in wings or the pappus of achenes; and 3, mucilage excreting hairs. Previous systems for classifying the different types of mucilage production did not recognize the mucilaginous nature of wings or a pappus. A short note on the composition of the mucilage is included.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alien plant invasions are among the major threats to natural and semi-natural ecosystems in South Africa on approximately 18 million hectares of land. Much of the available data are not suitable for planning of local scale management because it is presented at a quarter degree grid square scale, which makes accurate location and estimates of invaded areas difficult.Objectives: The aim was to identify the dominant alien plant species and quantify their areal extent along a 479 km railway corridor in the Mpumalanga province.Method: The extent of the invaded area was obtained by manual digitising of alien plant distribution and density from Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre 5 imagery and by further applying an Iterative Self-Organising Data Analysis technique of the unsupervised classification method. Species’ occurrences were located and identified in the field using a Global Positioning System.Results: The most dominant invaders in terms of the number of individual polygons and the infested area were Eucalyptus spp., Acacia spp., Populus alba L., Pinus patula Schltdl Cham., Salix babylonica L. and Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston. These species have also been previously classified as major invaders, although the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act regulations permit their planting provided spreading to adjacent areas is avoided except for C. decapetala, which must be cleared under all circumstances.Conclusion: Knowledge of the species’ occurrence and their extent will assist landowners and relevant authorities to control the spread of alien plants, which impact rail safety, agricultural production, water availability and biodiversity.",

It is a summer (late January–March) flowering succulent that grows on rocky outcrops at 1000 m–1600 m, and the conspicuous inflorescences suggest a pollination system focused towards birds.Objectives: To understand more about the pollination biology of A. reitzii var. reitzii.Methods: Nectar standing crop (flower volume and concentration) and the proportion of plants flowering were recorded. Camera traps and observations were used to record visitors to A. reitzii var. reitzii inflorescences.Results: Nectar volume was 36 μL ± 27 μL per flower (range 6 μL–93 μL; n = 27) and concentration was 16.5% ± 1.7% (range 13.5% – 19.5%). Camera trap observations, where 18.9% of all plants were observed flowering, recorded the three bird species Cape Weaver, Ploceus capensis, Malachite Sunbird, Nectarinia famosa and Greater Double-collared Sunbird, Cinnyris afer (60.4%, 27.1% and 12.5% of plant visits, respectively) visiting inflorescences.Conclusion: Because birds are important pollinators for many Aloe species, it is assumed that the bird species detected visiting A. reitzii var. reitzii are similarly important pollinators. At least 10 invertebrate species and sengi (Elephantulus sp.) were also recorded as visitors to flowers, but they may be less important pollinators than specialist and generalist avian nectarivores. This study provides further insight into the pollination biology of a diverse, and ecologically important, succulent genus in Africa.",

Celtis australis L. is a declared alien invasive tree. Celtis sinensis Pers. is not, but has become conspicuous in urban open spaces.Objectives: This study investigates the extent to which C. sinensis has become naturalised, constructs keys to distinguish between indigenous and cultivated Celtis species, and provides a descriptive treatment of C. sinensis.Methods: Land-cover types colonised by C. sinensis were randomly sampled with 16 belt transects. Woody species were identified, counted and height measured to determine the population structure. C. africana and the three alien Celtis species were cultivated for 2 years and compared morphologically.Results: Celtis sinensis, Ligustrum lucidum and Melia azedarach were found to be alien species, most abundant in urban areas. The population structure of C. sinensis corresponds to that of the declared invasive alien, M. azedarach. Although C. africana occurs naturally, it is not regularly cultivated. This is ascribed to erroneous plantings because of its resemblance to juvenile plants of C. sinensis. Keys are provided to identify Celtis species based on leaf shape and margin, and drupe characters.Conclusion: Celtis sinensis is naturalised in central South Africa, especially in urban open spaces and beginning to colonise natural areas. It is flagged as a species with invasive potential. Characteristics of the leaves and fruits allow for accurate identification of indigenous and alien Celtis species, both as juvenile or adult trees.",

    "abstract": "The explicit incorporation of the public trust doctrine into South Africa’s Bill of Rights in SouthAfrica’s Constitution, and its subsequent codification into the country’s environmentalbiodiversity, protected area, water, minerals and heritage legislation, occurred to a large extentwithout applause or fanfare. It is apparent that in the 20-odd years since the adoption of SouthAfrica’s Constitution, the existence and importance of the public trust doctrine within theacademic and legal fraternities, bureaucratic decision-making and the courts have largely beenoverlooked. This observation evokes curiosity about the history and evolution of the doctrineand its meaning and relevance in, at least, the conservation of biodiversity in a South Africancontext. It is concluded that the nature of the application of the public trust doctrine in SouthAfrica remains an enigma, and the development and refinement of this jurisprudence arerequired. The variable and, in places, conflicting wording of the trust-related provisions in anumber of South Africa’s environmental statutes suggests that the doctrine and hence thenature of its application was not fully understood by the drafters of the statutes or by thelegislature adopting those statutes into law. The public trust doctrine in South Africanenvironmental law lies beyond the country’s Constitution, and appears to have multiplebloodlines, which dispels the notion that South Africa hermetically imported the concept froma single source. The interpretation and hence the nature of the application of the doctrine inSouth Africa is likely to be influenced by the country’s heritage and hence is likely to varybetween the disciplines that constitute South Africa’s environmental law.",

    "abstract": "Elephant populations in South Africa are largely confined to fenced reserves and therefore require continued management to prevent high elephant densities that may cause habitat degradation. Growing human populations surrounding these reserves limit the possibility for wildlife range expansion, adding socio-economic considerations to the growing list of challenges reserve managers must contend with. Often, reserves have therefore opted to manage elephant population growth using various contraceptive methods to reduce birth rates, with lethal control acting as a last resort.Reserve owners at the Pongola Game Reserve South in northern KwaZulu-Natal opted to vasectomise the oldest male elephants to limit elephant population growth. Besides the reduction in birth rates, vasectomies were anticipated to have minimal impacts on behaviour. This study aimed to examine behavioural implications of treatment by monitoring musth, dominance and social behaviours of vasectomised males.Physical and behavioural observations of vasectomised males were recorded using instantaneous scan sampling and continuous focal samples of study individuals between 2011 and 2016. These data were also collected for non-treated adolescent males, with which to substantiate potential impacts of vasectomies.This case study has revealed that the behaviour of the vasectomised males was not influenced by vasectomies: musth was displayed as anticipated in the oldest males; a linear dominance hierarchy was maintained, headed by the oldest individual, and association patterns with female groups remained intact. Further, the younger non-treated males fell in line with the overall dominance hierarchy.This unique post-treatment study supports the use of vasectomies as a relatively cost-effective (one-off treatment), low-risk and successful tool for the management of elephant population growth, and an option which is preferable to both lethal control and hormonal contraceptives. Further research to establish the impacts of vasectomies on female behaviour and population dynamics is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Background: Deforestation is a complex and dynamic process of widespread concern in sub-Saharan Africa which is influenced by a range of social, economic and biophysical factors. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse patterns of deforestation and its potential drivers in the Licuáti Forest Reserve, a biodiversity hotspot in southern Mozambique between 1990 and 2016. Method: We performed image classification on Landsat imagery at six time steps and interviewed local community members to understand the spatial pattern and rate of forest cover loss over time. We also examined changes in the incidence of fire. Results: A substantial increase in the rate of deforestation since 1990 was detected in this vulnerable thicket vegetation. The probability of deforestation was significantly higher near the major roads, where houses are located. This suggests that the proximity of human settlements to the forest, and access to charcoal markets in urban areas, influenced the spatial pattern. Two key factors 1) charcoal production, and 2) the establishment of settlements and agricultural lands were identified as proximate causes of deforestation. In addition, fires associated with these two causes might amplify the loss of forests in the area. Conclusions: Complex interactions between the drivers of deforestation and socio-economic factors were suggested, as most of the charcoal produced in the region is transported to Maputo. Ongoing road improvements and infrastructural development in the region will likely accelerate the decline in forest cover in the future. This has implications for the biodiversity of the region as well as for the sustainability of local livelihoods, as they often depend on forest products for their daily uses.",

Plant biodiversity is high, as is indicated by the fact that in a study plot of only 4 250 m , a total of 115 plant species, 101 genera and 57 families were identified from a collection of 300 plant specimens. Seventy-seven plant species were found to be of some importance to the local communities. Out of the 77 useful plant species recorded: 22 species were used for medicinal purposes; 16 for firewood; 13 for construction, joinery and furniture; 12 for craftwork; 10 provided edible fruits and vegetables; and 27 were used for a variety of other purposes. These other purposes include construction of shrines, covering of granary floors, use as toilet paper, carry ing luggage, and fodder for goats, sheep and cattle. Arundinaria alpina K. Schum. (bamboo) is the species that is most extensively harvested from the forest.",

The composition of the 19 distinct communities is determined through an intricate combination of environmental factors as evident from the ordination results. Firstly drainage line' position is critical, followed by land use history and further by the interplay between elevation and geology. These findings are in line with results obtained from other studies along the eastern Escarpment. Alluvium, mafic and ultramafic lavas support mixed veld, whereas felsic lavas, sandstones and quartzites support sour veld which has a very low forage value in the dry’ season. Each community, through its specific species assemblage, structure and location, forms a distinctly different habitat in terms of its value to the various species of herbivores in the SGR",

The aim was to determine if the same patterns of gas exchange and ancillary parameters could be obtained with rather different measurement systems, and whether the same interpretation and conclusions about environmental control of gas exchange could be drawn. The following systems were compared: 1, a ‘closed’ portable 1RGA manufactured by Ll-Cor (LI-6200); 2, an ‘open’ portable porometer manufactured by Walz; and 3, a continuously monitoring minicuvette system with temperature control facility, also manufactured by Walz. All three systems yielded similar diurnal curves for CO2 uptake, although absolute flux values for the minicuvette system were lower than those obtained for the portable systems. This was likely due to stem respiration and self-shading of leaves on the shoot enclosed in the minicuvette. Differences in sampling technique between the two portable systems, primarily with regard to changes in leaf orientation, resulted in some differences in absolute values of gas fluxes and ancillary parameters such as leaf temperature and leaf to air vapour pressure difference. However, data from all three systems allowed similar interpretations to be made about the environmental dependencies of gas exchange patterns. It appears that each system has certain drawbacks associated with widely varying field conditions. A combination of portable and continuous monitoring techniques would seem to be the most powerful approach to investigating the gas exchange patterns of terrestrial plants in their natural environment.",

This observation is the most important justification for separating Asthenatherum from Danthonia, which has non-Kranz anatomy. Significant epidermal variation was observed, particularly in the form and occurrence of macro-hairs and prickles. These epidermal differences appear to correlate with geographical distribution and growth form of the plants and may be of infraspecific taxonomic significance. The epidermal variation is continuous, but three more or less distinct groups can be recognized: annual plants with unique macro-hairs with corrugated walls; annual or perennial plants without macro-hairs but with large straight prickles without swollen bases; and perennial plants without these large prickles. These groups appear to represent an intergrading cline along an increasing moisture gradient eastwards from the Namib Desert in South West Africa/Namibia.",

    "abstract": "Southern Africa is characterized by a highly diversified vegetational cover with extremes as contrasting as desert, tropical forest, alpine grassland, or mediterranean type scrub, and many other types in between. This vegetational pattern is strongly correlated to the climatological pattern. It is therefore likely that past changes in climate can still be partly traced in the vegetational pattern, particularly in geographical anomalies, and that study of these patterns provides complementary evidence to palynological research. The following anomalies in the vegetational pattern are briefly discussed: 1. island-wise occurrence of Afro-montane vegetation on mesic, sheltered sites in the southern Sudano- Zambezian Region, in particular in the Highveld grassland/False Karoo transition area; 2. similar westward occurrence of Sudano-Zambezian scrub patches in the Karoo-Namib Region near the Orange/Vaal confluence; 3. scattered occurrence of Sudano-Zambezian woody species in a matrix of Karoo-Namib vegetation in the marginal Karoo-Namib Region; 4. island-wise occurrence of frost-tolerant, dry, karroid dwarf shrub vegetation of predominantly C,-plants on isolated peaks in the winter rainfall area of Namaqualand; 5. peculiar patchy distribution of some succulents in wide areas of climatically rather homogeneous, succulent dwarf shrub vegetation of predominantly CAM-plants in the escarpment area of Namaqualand. a pattern reminiscent of that in many Cape fynbos species. Interpretation of these patterns logically leads to the conclusion that these result from a previously wetter, a previously cooler, or a previously wetter and cooler climate, respectively, over the parts of southern Africa under discussion. This conclusion is compared with published palynological views.",

Relevé sampling method and classification procedures of the floristic-sociological (Braun-Blanquet) approach as well as numerical data analyses (numerical classification and ordination) were used to reveal syn- taxonomic patterns and characterize the position of the syntaxa along major environmental gradients. Nine plant communities were recognized, three of which were classified as associations, following formal syntaxonomic and nomenclatural rules of the floristic-sociological approach Most of the studied mire communities were dominated by low-growing clonal restios (Restionaceae). whereas some consisted of other types of graminoids. The most important species determining the structure (and function) of the mire communities on sandstones of the HHM include restios Anthochortus crinalis, Chondropetalum deustum.C. mucronatum, Elegia intermedia. E. thyrsifera. Restio subtilis. R. purpurascens. cyperoids Epischoenus villosus. Ficinia argy-ropa, grasses Ehrharta setacea subsp. setacea. Pentameris hirtiglumis as well as shrubs Berzelia squarrosa. Cliffortia tricuspi- data. Erica intenallaris and Grubbia rosmarinifolia. Protea lacticolor and Restio perplexus dominate a rare shale band seep­age community. There are two major groups of communities—the fens (dominated by carpets of Anthochortus crinalis and other low-growing species) and the restio marshlands (mosaics of low tussocks of Restio subtilis and tall Chondropetalum mucrona­tum). The degree of soil (and water) minerotrophy was found to be the most important differentiating feature between the mire (fen and restio marshland) communities studied. The soils in the centre of mires were found to have high contents of peat and showed very little influence from the underlying sandstone. The soils along the mire margins had a greater admixture of mineral soil derived from the sandstone or shale bedrock.",

One of only three species of the section with radially symmetric flowers, it is acaulescent and has linear, almost plane leaves covered with long hairs, a perianth tube 45-60(-75) mm long, and subequal, spreading tepals. Babiana virescens blooms in early winter, in May and June, and occurs in seasonally moist open ground on gentle slopes and valley bottoms in southern Namaqualand between Nuwerus and Bitterfontein. It is distinguished by the slightly misted, oblong leaves with thickened, pale margins, and the glabrous cataphvlls and leaf sheaths. The stem, which may be produced up to 100 mm above the ground, is simpleor has a single short branch and the spikes bear 2-6 greenish flowers, the tepals of which are unusually narrow and longer than the perianth tube.

    "abstract": "Field and laboratory investigation of the six varieties of Ixia rapunculoides Delile (recognized in the current revisions and flora accounts of this southern African genus of some 65 species) show that a revised taxonomy better reflects the biology of the complex. The complex is defined by the funnel-shaped perianth tube, filaments fully and anthers partly included in the perianth tube. Our conclusions indicate that I. rapunculoides (currently var. rapunculoides) is restricted to the western Karoo and has broad, leathery leaves, a short perianth tube, mostly 5.5-8.0 mm long, and half nodding blue-mauve flowers. Plants currently referred to I. rapunculoides var. flaccida G.J.Lewis, include four sets of populations that we regard as two separate species. These are: I. flaccida with small, short-tubed white- or pale blue-flushed flowers, sofl-textured leaves and corms with basal cormlets from the Olifants River Valley and nearby; and I. sobolifera from the Western and Little Karoo, which has linear leaves, nodding spikes and flowers and corms with stolons. We divide I. sobolifera into three subspecies: subsp. carnea with pink flowers, is restricted to the Bokkeveld Plateau and nearby; subsp sobolifera with slate-blue flowers occurs in the Klein Roggeveld and nearby; and subsp albiflora with strongly scented white flowers occurs in the central Little Karoo. The taxon called I. rapunculoides var. namaquana (L.Bolus) G.J.Lewis, defined by a longer perianth tube, mostly 13-16 mm long, horizontally oriented, white, pale lilac or pink flowers and few-flowered lateral branchlets. is treated as I. namaquana, first described by H.M.L. Bolus in 1931. Plants referred to this taxon from south of its range at Hex River pass and nearby, however, have fully included anthers, a longer perianth tube. 16-20 mm. and ascending purple-pink flowers with a white cup and are referred to the new I. oxalidiflora. Two more varieties, I. rapunculoides var. subpendula G.J.Lewis and var. rigida sensu G.J.Lewis, which have upright flowers and distinctively branched stems are treated here as I. divaricata and I. contorta. Plants in the past included in var. rapunculoides from the Klein Roggeveld, south of the range of typical I. rapunculoides, have a longer perianth tube. 10-14 mm long, and attenuate, slightly lacerate. 5-veined. dry. rust-tipped bracts and comprise the new I. lacerata In addition, plants from streambeds in the Roggeveld that have large, white flowers, are not included in current accounts of the genus, and also represent a novel taxon, I. rivulicola. Lastly, I. rapunculoides var. robusta G.J.Lewis, the range of which falls entirely within that of var. rapunculoides and is usually sympatric with it. has pink flowers of similar structure, but four or five leaves and deep-seated corms with a collar of coarse fibres around the stem base. We raise this plant to species rank as I. robusta",

    "abstract": "Background: The understanding of the impact of land-use on the dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages during varying climate conditions on rivers is limited.Objective: To determine the impact of land-use types and flow on phytoplankton assemblages in the Sabie River.Methods: The relationships between land-use patterns, water quality and phytoplankton assemblages were analysed using canonical correspondence analyses (CCA).Results: Six main land-use types could be distinguished in the eight identified sub-catchments of the river. The CCA results showed that the land-use had a stronger correlation with phytoplankton classes during the higher flow conditions than during low flow conditions. The forestry land-use type had the strongest correlation with nitrate–nitrite concentrations in the Sabie River. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were higher during 2016, and a slightly lower number of genera were observed for the class Chlorophyceae. During 2017 the number of genera of the class Cyanophyceae decreased together with chlorophyll-a and total cell concentrations.Conclusion: Low flow conditions favoured filamentous genera that are common to mesotrophic conditions while higher flow conditions favoured single-celled small genera more common to oligotrophic waters with higher disturbance. This study showed that flow has the potential to enhance the impact of land-use on phytoplankton community dynamics in a river system and thereby may have further impacts on the health and activities of surrounding communities.",

The first is that it is a homogeneous vegetation type. The second is that small fragments are subsets (in terms of species) of the larger fragments. We used three sets of data. Species lists showed that more than 44 % of the species identified at 16 sites were unique to that site. Examining the dominant and rare species occurring at subsites within large fragments showed that, on average three-quarters, and never less than half, of the species were confined to one subsite. Analyses of rare and endangered plant species lists showed that the average distance separating patches of the same species was almost 30 km. Only 36.4 % of the rare or endangered species localities coincided with a major ( 25 ha) fragment. Our first conclusion was that many endemic species are constrained by micro- or meso-habitat demands that are not immediately obvious to the observer, and hence the vegetation should not be considered locally homogeneous. Our second conclusion was that the smaller fragments ( 25 ha) are of importance for the conservation of West Coast Renosterveld plant species.",

(Iridaceae: Iridoideae), a genus of cormous geophytes, we recognize 18 species, eight more than were included in the 1979 account of the genus by M.P. de Vos. One of these, F. ovata, based on Moraea ovata Thunb. (1800), was only discovered to be a species of Ferraria in 2001, and three more are the result of our different view of De Vos’s taxonomy. In tropical Africa, F. glutinosa is recircumscribed to include only mid- to late summer-flowering plants, usually with a single basal leaf and with purple to brown flowers often marked with yellow. A second summer-flowering species, F. candelabrum, includes taller plants with several basal leaves. Spring and early summer-flowering plants lacking foliage leaves and with yellow flowers from central Africa are referred to F. spithamea or F. welwitschii respectively.",

    "abstract": "The southern African genus Ixia L. comprises ± 90 species from the winter-rainfall zone of the subcontinent. Ixia sect. Dichone (Salisb. ex Baker) Goldblatt J.C.Manning, one of four sections in the genus and currently including 10 species and three varieties, is distinguished by the following floral characters: lower part of the perianth tube filiform and tightly clasping the style; filaments not decurrent; upper part of the perianth tube short to vestigial; style branches involute-tubular and stigmatic only at the tips; and so-called subdidymous anthers. We review the taxonomy of the section, providing complete descriptions and distribution maps, and a key to the species. I. amethystina Manning Goldblatt is recognized to be a later synonym of I. brevituba G.J.Lewis. Most collections currently included under that name represent another species, here described as I. rigida. We recognize five additional species in the section: early summer-blooming I. altissima from the Cedarberg; I. bifolia from the Caledon District; I. flagellaris, a stoloniferous species from the Cedarberg; I. simulans from the western Langeberg; and I. tenuis from the Piketberg. We also raise to species rank I. micrandra var. confusa and var. minor, as I. confusa and I. minor respectively. Foliar and associated floral variation in the widespread I. scillaris has led us to recognize two new subspecies among its northern populations, broad leaved subsp. latifolia and the dwarfed, smaller flowered subsp. toximontana; subsp. scillaris is restricted to the immediate southwestern Cape, from Darling to Somerset West. Sect. Dichone now has 17 species and two subspecies.",

    "abstract": "We describe two new species in the largely sub-Saharan genus Moraea Mill. (± 205 spp.) from its centre of diversity in the winter rainfall region of southern Africa. Moraea intermedia, from north-central Namaqualand near Springbok, is a member of the small section Tubiflorae (now eight species), remarkable in its growth habit with a long basal intemode. leaves clustered at the first aerial node, and Moraea-type stamens and style branches but subequal tepals with very short claws that clasp only the base of the filament column. Moraea vuvuzela. a member of series Galaxia of the Galaxia group of the genus (now 17 species), has deeply fringed stigma lobes, filaments free in the upper 1 mm, ± prostrate, lanceolate leaves and. remarkable for the series, dark brown to purple markings near the base of the tepal limbs. In the unusually variable M.fugax, currently with two subspecies, new collections of subsp. fugax co-occurring but on different soils with subsp. filicaulis, cast doubt on their current treatment as members of the same species. We now favour recognition of the diminutive subsp.filicaulis as a separate species, M. filicaulis. In the M iripetala group we recommend recognition of the early blooming M. punctata, described in 1892 and later subsumed in M. iripetala but readily distinguished by the long inner tepals broader in the midline and short, relatively broad, plane rather than channelled leaves. We also report small but significant range extensions for M. barkerae, M. macrocarpa and M. tricolor.",

Hankey who initiated further collaborative research.Objective: To describe the new species of Ledebouria from Blouberg mountain massif in Limpopo Province, South Africa.Method: Relevant existing specimens in herbaria were examined and morphological characters and states noted. The type specimen was collected during an expedition under the guidance of Prof. Dirk Bellstedt accompanied by Mr Adam Harrower.Results: Ledebouria caesiomontana A.J.Hankey N.Hahn sp. nov. was described and illustrated. The new species was distinguished from its closest relative, Ledebouria papillata S.Venter, by the ovary which lacks basal lobes, as well the absence of cataphylls and the irregular papillate ridges present only on the upper leaf surfaces.Conclusion: Ledebouria caesiomontana is a new species restricted to the Blouberg mountain massif in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Initial estimates deem the species to be vulnerable (VU D2) as a result of especially anthropogenic-induced disturbances on the Blouberg.",

Numerous southern African species and infraspecific taxa (at least 19 names, 17 species and 2 varieties) have been described by various authors in the past, but were later reduced into synonymy with R. totta. Currently, only the typical variety is recognised in Southern Africa.Objectives: To investigate and update the circumscription of the taxa within the R. totta complex in southern Africa and to update their synonymies and distribution ranges. Methods: Specimens of R. totta at GRA, JRAU, K, NH and PRE were studied and compared, and measurements of characters recorded. Populations were also observed during field studies.Results: The examination of numerous specimens, as well as field investigations, has prompted the recognition of four varieties (one described here as new: R. totta var. longicalyx) and a new species (R. pedunculata) in southern Africa.Conclusions: A great variation in leaf structure and vestiture occurs within the R. totta complex, with the extreme forms easily recognisable. However, the total number of varieties are limited to four [R. totta vars. totta, longicalyx, rigidula and venulosa] and a new species described to accommodate specimens with a distinctly prostrate habit and upwardly directed leaves.",

    "abstract": "Background: Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is a key tool in conservation prioritisation. It has recently been applied within the eThekwini Municipal Area (EMA), South Africa, a rapidly developing metro located within a biodiversity hotspot. Most vegetation types within this region are threatened, yet have received limited scientific attention. Objectives: To assess forb biodiversity of coastal and near-coastal grasslands and contextualise potential drivers of species variation to the EMA context. Method: We quantified forb species richness, frequency and species composition, determined the variation of these amongst plots and sites, and assessed which variables were responsible for this variation. Results: Site forb species richness ranged from 33 to 84 species per site, with the most frequent species differing across the seven sites. Beta diversity was higher across than within sites. Distance to the closest traditional medicine market and site perimeter-to-area ratio were the greatest drivers of species richness, whilst altitude, aspect, mean temperature and rainfall seasonality were the main contributors to species composition patterns. Conclusion: SCP can use key environmental and climatic categories to improve selection of grasslands to maximise both species richness and variation in species composition. A more fine-scale systematic conservation plan will, in turn, provide a more robust basis for development decisions. The outcomes illustrate the importance of urban and peri-urban conservation efforts, including fine-scale conservation planning, in contributing to regional, national conservation targets.",

It is concluded that the discretionary clauses in NEMPAA may need to be amended to limit or refine the discretion politicians may apply.",

    "abstract": "Background: The genus Amaranthus is taxonomically complex because of its high morphological variability, which led to nomenclatural confusion, misapplication of names and misidentifications. Unfortunately, floristic and taxonomic studies on this genus are still incomplete. A population of Amaranthus crassipes subsp. warnockii was discovered in Monastir Governorate, Tunisia, representing the first record for both the Tunisian and the African floras, as well as the first one outside of its American native distribution area. Objectives: The main aim of the present study was to record Amaranthus crassipes subsp. warnockii (I.M.Johnst.) N.Bayón in Tunisia and Africa for the first time. Morphological characters and ecological data were provided. Clarification about the typification of the names Amaranthus crassipes, A. warnockii and Scleropus amaranthoides was also presented. Methods: The work was based on field surveys, analysis of relevant literature and examination of specimens preserved in the herbaria GH, HAL, P, RO, NY, US and the Herbarium of the Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir (Monastir University). Results: Nomenclatural notes were provided for Schlechtendal’s A. crassipes (lectotype at HAL, designated by Henrickson in 1999 but here corrected according to Art. 9.10 of the ICN); Schrader’s Scleropus amaranthoides [a superfluous and illegitimate name (Arts. 52.1 and 52.2 of the ICN) and regarded as a homotypic synonym of A. crassipes s.str.]; and Moquin-Tandon’s Scleropus amaranthoides [an invalid name (Art. 36.1a of the ICN)]. Conclusion: Amaranthus crassipes subsp. warnockii is an alien species in Tunisia, growing in human-made habitat on clayey and sandy substrates within ruderal vegetation where it can be considered a casual. We hope that in the future continuous monitoring of the population will take place, to verify the possible naturalisation and spread of this taxon in Tunisia. If the latter happens, actions for eradication of the plants are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Much of the Grassland Biome in South Africa is prone to shrub encroachment, leading to loss of ecosystem services, habitat heterogeneity and species diversity. Burrowing mammals are an important component of grasslands as these animals create microhabitats for other taxa, including smaller mammal species, birds, reptiles and invertebrates. However, our understanding of how shrub encroachment affects burrowing mammals is poor. Objectives: Here we assessed the relationship between burrow abundance and bankrupt bush, Seriphium plumosum, encroachment as well as burrowing mammal diversity in bankrupt bush encroached and non-encroached grasslands. Method: Shrub density, medium and large mammal burrow abundance and density were measured in 24 encroached and 24 non-encroached areas randomly selected in the Telperion Nature Reserve, Mpumalanga, South Africa. In addition, burrowing mammal diversity was assessed using camera traps in a subset of six encroached and six non-encroached areas. Results: Our results show that the abundance and density of medium and large burrows were significantly lower in encroached areas than in non-encroached areas (p = 0.011 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The relationship between burrow abundance and bankrupt bush encroachment was negative (rho = -0.456, p = 0.001). However, burrowing mammal diversity had no significant difference between encroached and non-encroached areas. Conclusion: Our data, therefore, suggest that with increasing bankrupt bush encroachment and a decreased abundance in burrowing mammal ecosystem services, a negative effect will occur on burrowing mammal communities, leading to the reduction in species-specific habitat heterogeneity and possibly animal biodiversity.",

Occasionally one of the nuclei failed to develop into a synergid, resulting in three polar nuclei. Contrary to published information, the antipodal cells did not increase in size, nor was there an increase in the number of nuclei per cell. Although the occurrence of sexuality is confirmed, no definite evidence exists for the occurrence of apomixis. The occurrence of two embryo sacs per locule might be the result of either apospory or of sexuality whereby two embryo sacs were formed from two megaspores.",

The fourth taxon, P. ferulaceum is recognized as a subspecies ot'P carnosum. As is implied from the occurrence of morphological intermediates and partly from molecular evidence,hybridization does not only occur among the taxa in this complex but also involves species closely related to this group (P. panifiorum J.C.Wendl., P. laxum (Sweet) G.Don, P. dasyphyllum R.Knuth). For the taxa in the P. carnosum complex, distribution areas are delineated and diagnostic features that have until now remained obscure, are outlined.",

One such species is the Blue Swallow Hirundo atrocaerulea, a critically endangered grassland specialist bird species endemic to sub-Saharan Africa.Objectives: Past research has shown a serious decline in range and abundance of this species, predominantly because of habitat transformation and fragmentation.Method: The influence of land cover on Blue Swallow habitat and foraging home range, in both natural and transformed habitats, was investigated by radio tracking adult birds.Results: Results showed that tracked birds spent over 80% of their forage time over grasslands and wetland habitats, and preferentially used these ecotones as forage zones. This is likely owing to an increase in insect mass and abundance in these habitats and ecotones. There was reduced selection and avoidance of transformed habitats such as agricultural land, and this is a concern as transformed land comprised 71% of the home range with only 29% of grassland and wetland mosaic remaining for the Blue Swallows to breed and forage in, highlighting the importance of ecotones as a key habitat requirement. The results indicate that management plans for the conservation of Blue Swallows must consider protecting and conserving naturalhabitats and maintaining mosaic of grassland and wetland components to maximise ecotones within conserved areas.Conclusion: To this end, the stewardship programme spearheaded by local conservation agencies, which aims to formally conserve privately owned patches of untransformed grassland and other natural habitats, may have a strong impact on the long-term persistence of Blue Swallow populations.",

The most speciose families were Fabaceae Asteraceae Rubiaceae. The species richness was highest at the disturbed primary forest and notably lower at the primary forest. Diversity indices exhibited a similar trend. Cluster analyses and ordinations indicated that the secondary forest was intermediate between the two primary forests, with the disturbed primary forest and secondary forest being more similar.Conclusion: The disturbed and secondary forests maintained a NCF floristic affinity. The dissimilarity between Hawaan and other forests is most likely the product of differing disturbance histories and rehabilitation efforts. The findings suggested that NCF patches are likely to be different in richness, but not in structure and affinity. Anthropogenic related pressures and disturbance appear to be major causes of floristic differences amongst patches. This leads to higher levels of richness by accommodating opportunistic, atypical and alien species, and possibly the creation of novel NCF types.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) Bryophyte Specialist Group has recently launched the ‘Top 10 Initiative’ to identify the 10 species on each continent that are at highest risk of extinction.Objectives: The main aim of this paper was to highlight some of the lost or strongly threatened bryophyte species in sub-Saharan Africa and the East African islands and to draw up a Top 10 list for Africa.Method: Lost or threatened species have been identified with the help of experts on the bryoflora of Africa, global and regional Red Lists and taxonomic literature. Each species on this candidate list is discussed at the hand of its taxonomy, distribution, habitat, threat and current global or regional Red List status as far as previously assessed.Results: Fifty bryophyte species, representing 40 genera and 23 families, have been identified as Top 10 candidates. Of these, 29 are endemic to Africa and 21 are restricted to the East African islands. The majority of the candidate species occur in one of eight ‘biodiversity hotspots’ with most species (19) in the Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands hotspot.Conclusion: This is the first list of lost or threatened bryophytes for Africa and the first Top 10 list of the IUCN Bryophyte Specialist Group.

It is regarded as an area of high botanical diversity. Yet only few localised studies on the vegetation composition are available. The Khomas Hochland is formed on the southern part of the Damara Orogen and dominated by metamorphosed sediments. Climatically it forms a transition between the hot desert of the Namib and the slightly cooler hot steppe in the inland.Objectives: To classify and provide syntaxonomical descriptions of the vegetation of the Khomas Hochland.Methods: A dataset comprising 1151 relevés and 914 species was compiled from various surveys, mostly collected under, and to the standards of, the umbrella project ‘Vegetation Survey of Namibia’. For first classifications, the data set was reduced to a synusial set consisting of trees, shrubs, dwarf shrubs and grasses only.Results: The classification resulted in four major landscape units, being the Pre-Namib and Escarpment zone, the Khomas Hochland proper, riverine habitats as well as surrounding lowlands. The classification was further refined using Cocktail procedures to produce 30 associations, one with four sub-associations. These are described in this paper.Conclusion: A classification of synoptic data grouped the associations into five orders and one undefined cluster of associations on specialised desert habitats. Four of these orders correspond to the habitat types identified in the first classification. The fifth order, the Senegalio hereroensis–Tarchonanthoetalia camphorathi, represents high mountains of the central Khomas Hochland, which link biogeographically to the grassland biome in South Africa.",

Biodiversity is a key aspect needed to justify nomination of a Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme. Previously documented biodiversity of the two protected areas is limited in terms of coverage and scope as well as being outdated. The aim of the current study was to conduct a rapid assessment of the biodiversity, including endemism, of the proposed Biosphere Reserve to inform the formal nomination process.Methods: A field survey was undertaken over 112 033 ha in the core, buffer and transition zones of the proposed Biosphere Reserve during which species of both flora and fauna were documented. Purposeful recordings were made during different seasons to incorporate various flowering seasons of the plants, as well as faunal species that may hibernate or migrate seasonally.Results: A total of 380 plant species was recorded, 30 of which are legally protected in the country, 60 endemic to the Drakensberg Mountain Centre, and two species (Aloe polyphylla and Glumicalyx lesuticus) are endemic to Lesotho. The former is the national flower of Lesotho and is under threat due to illegal trade. Sixteen mammal species were recorded, seven of which are legally protected in the country, as well as 53 bird species (including the IUCN Red Listed vulture species, Gyps coprotheres and Gypaetus barbatus). Two fish species were also recorded including Pseudobarbus quathlambae, which is Lesotho’s only known endemic vertebrate species, as well as seven reptile and three amphibian species (two of which are near endemic namely Amietia delalandii and A. vertebralis).Conclusion: This survey has provided valuable baseline information on the biodiversity (particularly regarding the flora and avifauna) of the proposed Biosphere Reserve, which includes two protected areas namely Bokong Nature Reserve and Tšehlanyane National Park. The findings reflect the biodiversity value of the area and will contribute towards its nomination as Lesotho’s first Biosphere Reserve.",

M. striata Goldblatt J.C.Manning (subg. Visciramosae Goldblatt) from the southern foothills of the Great Swartberg Mtns has khaki-green flowers with reflexed tepal limbs streaked with dark lines. The acaulescent M. singularis Goldblatt J.C.Manning (subg. Umbellatae Goldblatt J.C.Manning) with terete leaf blades is restricted to the dry, interior foothills of the Kamiesberg in Northern Cape. M. filamentosa Goldblatt J.C.Manning, subg. Acaules (Baker) Goldblatt J.C.Manning, is described from the dry interior of Namaqualand in Northern Cape. The species is closely allied to the widespread M. falcifolia Klatt. In subg. Polyanthes (Goldblatt) Goldblatt J.C.Manning, we describe M. thermarum Goldblatt J.C.Manning (sect. Hexaglottis (Vent.) Goldblatt) from southwestern Namibia, allied to M. brevituba (Goldblatt) Goldblatt, and M. lazulina Goldblatt J.C.Manning (sect. Pseudospicata Goldblatt J.C.Manning) from the Little Karoo, until now confused with M. exiliflora Goldblatt but differing in its larger flowers with strongly reflexed tepals. The new M. petricola Goldblatt J.C.Manning (subg. Vieusseuxia (D.Delaroche) Goldblatt), is restricted to higher elevations of the Pakhuis Mtns of northern Western Cape. Lastly, in subg. Homeria (Vent.) Goldblatt J.C.Manning, we recognize M. doleritica Goldblatt J.C.Manning with pale yellow flowers and anthers exceeding the style branches, restricted to dolerite outcrops in the Great Karoo, and M. eburnea Goldblatt J.C.Manning from the northern foothills of the Klein Swartberg, which has a single, basal leaf and pale yellow flowers with filaments free distally. Moraea now has 222 species, including 203 in southern Africa, of which 200 are endemic to the region.

Most (68%) fishes appeared to be undisturbed by the ROV. Species saturation was reached after a maximum of 135 minutes survey time, but species numbers increased and saturation times shortened (34 minutes minimum) with the introduction of bait.Conclusion: ROV surveys may represent a non-extractive alternative to assess demersal ichthyofaunal diversity in relation to habitat structure and benthic cover on temperate reefs around South Africa.",

    "abstract": "A review of the genera Othonna and Senecio undertaken for the forthcoming Greater Cape plants 2: Namaqualand-southern Namib and western Karoo (Manning in prep.) led to a re-examination of the taxonomic status of several species. This was facilitated by the recent availability of high-resolution digital images on the Aluka website (www.aluka.org) of the Drege isotypes in the Paris Herbarium that formed the basis of many species described by De Candolle in his Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. These images made it possible to identify several names whose application had remained uncertain until now. Each case is briefly discussed, with citation of additional relevant herbarium specimens. The following species are reduced to synonomy: O. incisa Harv. is included in O. rosea Harv.; O. spektakelensis Compton and O. zeyheri Sond. ex Harv. are included in O. retrorsa DC.; S. maydae Merxm. is included in S. albopunctatus Bolus, which is now considered to include forms with radiate and discoid capitula; S. cakilefolius DC. is included in O. arenarius Thunb.; S. pearsonii Hutch, is included in O. aspertdus DC.; S. parvifolius DC. is included in S. carroensis DC.; S. eriobasis DC. is included in S. erosus L.f.; and S. lobelioides DC. is included in S. flavus (Decne.) Sch.Bip. The name S. panduratus (Thunb.) Less, is identified as a synonym of S. erosus L.f. and plants that are currently know n under this name should be called S. robertiifolius DC.

O. perfoliata is lecto- typified against a specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN) w ith radiate capitula. The name O. filicaulis correctly applies to a radiate species and is treated as a synonym of O. perfoliata.

A second new species. A grandis. from the southwestern Cape was previously included in A. fragrans Jacq. (section Falconera series Falconera). It is a robust species that flowers in winter and early spring and the styles are rugulose with ± isodiametric epidermal cells, unlike typical A. fragrans which is a more slender species flowering in early summer and with derived, smooth styles with fusiform epidermal cells. The recent discovery of a flowering population matching the type of A. albucoides (Aiton) J.C.Manning Goldblatt (subgenus Osmyne) allows for a full description and illustration of this poorly know n and taxonomically neglected species that has often been included in A. suaveolens (Jacq.) J.C.Manning Goldblatt. Lastly, examination of the type of A. reflexa Krause Dinter from Namibia shows it to be conspecific w ith Drimia indica (Roxb.) Jessop.",

    "abstract": "Three new species of Gladiolus L. are described from South Africa. G. dolichosiphon is the second known member of series Blandus from the mountains of the Little Karoo in Western Cape, and is distinguished from other members of the long tubed, pink-flowered G. carneus complex by its 5 or 6 linear leaves, creamy pink to salmon flowers with a tube 30-50 mm long and longer than the dorsal tepal, and its late summer flowering. G. karooicus from the Klein Roggeveld and the northern foothills of the Witteberg, is a spring-flowering species allied to G. permeabilis but has bright, canary-yellow flowers with the lower part of the lower tepals involute and conspicuously auriculate. G. reginae is an edaphic endemic of the Sekhuk- huneland Centre of Floristic Endemism in Mpumalanga, and flowers in autumn. It is evidently a glabrous member of section Densiflorus series Scabridus, distinguished by its long-tubed flowers, streaked with red on the lower tepals and blotched with red in the throat. Anomalously, however, it has the tubular inner bracts and large capsules diagnostic of section Ophiolyza series Oppositiflorus. A re-examination of the morphology suggests that series Scabridus is better placed in section Ophiolyza and a slightly revised classification of Gladiolus in southern Africa is proposed. We also propose the replacement name G. sulculatus for the Tanzanian species, G. sulcatus Goldblatt, a later homonym of G. sulcatus Lam. Finally, a recent sighting of what appears to be G. rubellus from northern Namibia constitutes the first record of this species in the country and a major range extension from its previous known occurrence in southeastern Botswana.",

    "abstract": "Background: Aloe ortholopha is a rare endemic confined to serpentine soils of the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. Its International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status is listed as Vulnerable; however, its population biology and life history are poorly documented.Objectives: The aim of this article is to provide information on the population biology and life history of A. ortholopha through assessment of its size-class distribution, population size and density, reproductive output and fitness, and threats related to fire and mining.Method: Circumference of A. ortholopha leaf rosette was used to ascertain size-class distribution. Population size and density were determined by enumerating flowering individuals. Per-capita reproductive output was determined as mean number of flowers per plant, fruit set and mean number of seeds per fruit. Fitness was determined from seed germination capacity. Impact of fire and mining were recorded photographically.Results: Determination of size-class distribution of A. ortholopha from three study sites (southern region [SR], central region [CR] and northern region [NR]) revealed a bell-shaped curve dominated by intermediate size classes. Population size (number of flowering individuals) ranged from 36 to 66 per site. This translated to a density of 4.0–7.3 flowering plants per hectare. Per-capita reproductive output, measured as mean number of flowers per plant, was significantly different in SR and CR compared to that in the NR region. Mean number of fruits per plant did not significantly differ across the three regions. Mean seed set per plant in CR and NR was significantly different to that in the SR region. Species fitness, as determined from in vitro germination assays, showed that seeds harvested from fire-damaged capsules have the lowest cumulative germination percentage. It was also observed that leaf rosettes curled up to form a ball that protects the apical centre of plants from fire damage.Conclusion: A. ortholopha occurs in small population clusters of low density. The species has a low per-capita reproductive output characterised by production of many flowers, but with very low percentage fruit and seed set. The species has low fitness as evidenced by nominal recruitment of saplings and juveniles. Conspecific mates are frequently lost owing to fire and mining activities.",

    "abstract": "Field and laboratory research has shown that the Moraea tripetala complex of western South Africa, traditionally treated as a single species, sometimes with two additional varieties, has a pattern of morphological and cytological variation too complex to be accommodated in a single species. Variation in floral structure, especially the shape of the inner tepals, degree of union of the filaments, anther length and pollen colour form coherent patterns closely correlated with morphology of the corm tunics, mode of vegetative reproduction, and in some instances capsule and seed shape and size. The morphological patterns also correlate with geography, flowering time and sometimes habitat. It is especially significant that different variants of the complex may co-occur, each with overlapping or separate flowering times, a situation that conflicts with a single species taxonomy. We propose recognizing nine species and three additional subspecies for plants currently assigned to M. tripetala. M. grandis, from the western Karoo, has virtually free filaments and leaves often ± plane distally; closely allied M. amabilis, also with ± free filaments and often hairy leaves, is centred in the western Karoo and Olifants River Valley. Its range overlaps that of M. cuspidata, which has narrowly channelled, smooth leaves, linear inner tepals spreading distally and filaments united for up to 1.5 mm. M. decipiens from the Piketberg, M. hainebachiana, a local endemic of coastal limestone fynbos in the Saldanha District, M. ogamana from seasonally wet lowlands, and early flowering M. mutila constitute the remaining species of the complex in the southwestern Western Cape. M. helmei, a local endemic of middle elevations in the Kamiesberg, Namaqualand, has small flowers with short, tricuspidate inner tepals. All but M. amabilis and M. mutila are new species. We divide M. tripetala sensu stricto into three subspecies: widespread subsp. tripetala, subsp. violacea from the interior Cape flora region, and late-flowering subsp. jacquiniana from the Cape Peninsula and surrounding mountains.",

Phytosociological data obtained from the study area were analysed to identify plant communities and subsequent mapping units. Floristic gradients obtained through ordination techniques revealed the relationship that exists between the Woody Grassland of the study area and the Maputaland Woody Grassland of Sileza Nature Reserve.

    "abstract": "Background: The vegetation type boundaries in the North West province as they appear in the 2018 National Vegetation Map, for the most part, are derived from agricultural land types that were mapped in the 1980s. Aim &amp; objectives: Given (1) the importance the National Vegetation Map plays in conservation assessment and planning, as well as environmental planning and decision making; and (2) the map boundary errors reported by users, an update of the provincial vegetation map was considered necessary. Methods: A vegetation identification key using high-level environmental parameters (in order of importance: flooding, bioregion, terrain, geology and soil) was developed. This key was used to manually interpret high-resolution colour aerial imagery, together with existing environmental spatial datasets (land types as a proxy for soils, simplified geology and terrain/land form). The existing vegetation type concepts are sound and are mostly retained in this map. Results &amp; conclusion: Changes to the map include: (1) all vegetation boundaries in the province are remapped; (2) Olea Sclerophyllous Forest is proposed as a sub type/community related to the Northern Afrotemperate Forest vegetation type; (3) two existing vegetation types currently not mapped as occurring in the province are brought into the province, namely, Subtropical Alluvial Vegetation and Waterberg Mountain Bushveld; and (4) three vegetation units recognised in previous vegetation studies and which are not indicated in the current National Vegetation Map are included here as new vegetation types, namely, Vryburg Thornveld, Morokweng Thornveld and Central Sandy Mountain Bushveld. The descriptions of all terrestrial vegetation types occurring in the province are also updated and an updated annotated global plant species list for the province is provided. Changes reflected in this vegetation map have been incorporated into the National Vegetation Map Version 2024 beta.",

Little cytological data are available on the approximately 3 000 species in the family. The best studied subtribe is the Ceropegiinae (sensu Schumann, 1895) including the Stapelieae (as presently recognized) with its dominantly succulent members. Exactly half of the species are known karyologically. The basic chromosome number in the family is x = 11 and in most of the genera polyploid taxa are also to be found. The small size of the chromosomes makes individual identification very difficult and they form a graded series with very slight morphological differences. C-banding permits identification of heterochromatic regions; they all take up near centromeric positions. Therefore, studies aimed at an analysis of relationships with the aid of chromosome morphology on a lower taxonomic level, will hardly be possible. In so far as morphological characters of the inflorescence are concerned, diploid species of the genus Caralluma seem to form a species centre in South Arabia/East Africa.",

The preference Wild expressed for this model over a dispersalist model attributed to Levyns is investigated, making use of theoretical refinements developed in the dispersal vs vicariance debate within the past decade. The differences in intrepretations between Wild and Levyns appear to be unresolvable on account of their positions not being demarcated clearly enough, and the situation has not improved since then, underlining the need for attention to be given to the formulation of applicable, coherent and testable hypotheses in biogeography.",

The distribution, habitat and population dynamics of E. perangusta are discussed. The monitoring of the largest known population has revealed that this population has declined rapidly since the onset of a drought in 1983. The major cause of this decline appears to be the destruction of the plants by porcupines which feed on E. perangusta during droughts. It appears that, during droughts, E. perangusta is restricted to rocky ridges because there is an increase in porcupine damage on more accessible populations. The species is also subjected to other factors which reduce flower formation in a large proportion of plants. If these factors continue to operate, the species could become extinct in the near future. Conservation recommendations are discussed.",

In recent subfamily treatments Ehrharta has proved difficult to place satisfactorily, and during the past five years it has been moved between Bambusoideae and Arundinoideae. However, most previous systematic studies using cryptic characters have covered only four taxa out of about 35. The present study includes all African taxa, and demarcates seven species groups on the basis of both spikelet morphology and leaf blade anatomy. Parallelism and/or convergence in vegetative macromorphology within and between the species groups is widespread, and is similar, in some cases, to adaptations found in other plant families in the Fynbos Biome. However, these macromorphological trends are not reflected in the leaf anatomy. Leaf anatomy is generally consistent with the spikelet morphology. Some anatomical differences between the species groups in Ehrharta appear to be as great as differences between taxa of much higher ranks elsewhere in the Poaceae. This wide range of variability may be related to an early divergence of Ehrharteae from other grasses, as suggested by the Gondwanaland distribution, and may explain the difficulty of placing this fascinating yet baffling genus in a subfamily.",

Sampling of grass data was undertaken in six previously described, major vegetation types. TWINSPAN divisions distinguished grass assemblages that are characteristic for these major vegetation types of the study area. The results were supported by an Indirect Gradient Analysis. Further TWINSPAN divisions of a larger Maputaland data set indicated a floristic relationship between grass assemblages of similar major vegetation types in the study area and South Africa. This relationship was supported by high similarity values ( 65%), obtained with Sorenson's Coefficient. The coefficient also indicated varying degrees of similarity between grass assemblages of different major vegetation types within the study area. A rich diversity of 115 grass species and infraspecific taxa was recorded for the study area. The Chloridoideae and Panicoideae dominate the grass diversity and the genera with the most species include Eragrostis, Panicum and Digitaria. Most grass species in the study area are perennials and have a tufted growth form, but this varies considerably between vegetation types.",

Here described, ovule-to-seed development represents the first embryological information on this genus of the tribe Flacourtieae, Salicaceae sensu lato. Results are discussed in the light of data available on the embryology of the order Malpighiales in general and on the tribe Flacourtieae in particular. It is clear that Dovyalis E.Mey. ex Am. shares many characters with other members of the Flacourtieae. Ovules of D. caffra are anatropous. bitegmic and crassinucellate with both bisporic Allium- and monosporic Polygonum-type embryo sacs. One of the most characteristic embryological features of the tribe is the pres­ence of an unusual, extranucellar embryo sac that stretches halfway up into the micropyle. Since this extraordinary-shaped embryo sac also defines the embryo sacs of Salix L. and Populus L., it is suggested that the character provides strong sup­port for the proposed close phylogenetic link between tribes Flacourtieae and Saliceae of Salicaceae sensu lato.",

Such records provide an opportunity for improving biosecurity relating to potentially invasive but hitherto undetected non-native Poaceae in the FSA region.Objectives: To improve floristic data for non-native Poaceae occurring in theFSA region.Method: Field collections were made, herbarium collections, databases and relevant literature were studied.Results: New records are presented for non-native grasses that were encountered as locally common populations in the Drakensberg Mountain Centre of Floristic Endemism (DMC, Lesotho and South Africa). Festuca rubra and Agrostis capillaris are newly reported for sub-Saharan Africa and southern Africa and are also the first verified specimens reported for the African continent, with previous reports from northern-most Africa (Morocco, Algeria and/or Tunisia) uncertain. Jarava plumosa, introduced from South America and previously known for the whole of Africa from a single population in the Western Cape, South Africa, is newly reported from the border between the Eastern Cape, South Africa and Lesotho. The ecological implications, including the potential to become invasive, are discussed for each species, with taxonomic notes given to help differentiate them from closely resembling taxa.Conclusion: These new records of alien grass species raise concerns over their potential ecological impact, particularly as they are found in an area of conservation importance. Future efforts to monitor their distribution are of importance.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of combined pre-germination treatments on the seed behavior of crambe. From a seed sample of FMS Brilhante cultivar, an experimental design completely randomized with a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement was performed. It was formed from combination of two structural conditions, seeds with or without pericarp, and treatments with or without giberelic acid, being: control (no treatment); seeds pre-soaked in distilled water for 24 hours as control; and seeds pre-soaked in gibberellic acid at 4 % at different concentrations (400, 500 and 600 mg.L-1). Water content, first count germination, germination, seedling emergence and emergence rate index were determined. From these results it is concluded that removal of the pericarp in seed of crambe, cultivar FMS Brilhante, accelerated the germination rate, however, decreased your final percentage. The pre-soaking in gibberellic acid (400, 500 and 600 mg L-1) for 24 hours, increased the germination and seed vigor crambe with pericarp.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ongoing systematic studies of the African flora necessitate periodic nomenclatural adjustments and corrections.Objectives: To effect requisite nomenclatural changes.Method: Relevant literature was surveyed and type material located and studied.Results: Nomenclatural corrections were published in Justicia L. (Acanthaceae), Babiana KerGawl. and Geissorhiza Ker Gawl. (Iridaceae) and Zaluzianskya F.W.Schmidt (Scrophulariaceae).Conclusions: Firstly, a complete enumeration of all southern African species of Justicia was provided within the infrageneric classification for the genus accepted by Graham (1988) and later modified and expanded by Ensermu (1990) and Hedrén (1990). In this circumscription, Justicia includes such well-established segregates in an African context as Adhatoda Miller, Aulojusticia Lindau, Duvernoia E.Mey. ex Nees, Monechma Hochst. and Siphonoglossa Oersted.Both southern African species of Adhatoda were transferred to Justicia, as well as all of the southern African species of Monechma, with eight new combinations or replacement names provided. All species were placed to section within Justicia. Secondly, the type of Gladiolus nervosus Lam. (1788) was considered to be conspecific with Gladiolus strictus Aiton (1789) and is therefore the earliest available name for the species currently known as Babiana stricta (Aiton) Ker Gawl. The new combination Babiana nervosa (Lam.) Goldblatt J.C.Manning was provided. Thirdly, Geissorhiza ornithogaloides has been regarded as a new species described by F.W. Klatt (1866) but the name should be treated as the combination G. ornithogaloides (Lichst. ex Roem. Schult.) Klatt, based on Ixia ornithogaloides Lichst. ex Roem. Schult.(1817a). Examination of the type showed that it is conspecific with Geissorhiza marlothii R.C.Foster (1941) and it is therefore the valid name for the taxon treated as G. ornithogaloides subsp. marlothii (R.C.Foster) Goldblatt. An epitype for the taxon was designated and the new combination G. ornithogaloides subsp. flava (Klatt) Goldblatt J.C.Manning was provided for the taxon currently treated as G. ornithogaloides subsp. ornithogaloides. Lastly, Reyemia Hilliardwas reduced to a synonym of Zaluziaskya as sect. Reyemia (Hilliard) J.C.Manning Goldblattand the new combination Zaluziaskya chasmanthiflora (Hilliard) J.C.Manning Goldblatt was provided. A neotype was selected for Zaluziaskya nemesioides Diels.",

Members of the genus are difficult to identify at species level on the basis of macromorphology alone.Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the micromorphology of the lemma surface for differentiating amongst the southern African members of Helictotrichon.Method: Lemma surfaces were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Lemmas were obtained from herbarium specimens housed in the National Herbarium, Pretoria (PRE). These were mounted on aluminium stubs using double-sided adhesive tape, sputter-coated with gold, and photographs were taken using a J840 scanning electron microscope.Results: Based on whether the lemma surface is smooth, papillate, scaberulous, scabrid or a combination of these, five groups of species are distinguished. All species, except Helictotrichon barbatum which has a smooth lemma surface, have small prickles (scaberulous). Helictotrichon leoninum, Helictotrichon quinquesetum and Helictotrichon rogerellisii have only small prickles, whilst Helictotrichon dodii, Helictotrichon hirtulum, Helictotrichon namaquense and Helictotrichon roggeveldense have, in addition, medium to large prickles (scabrid). Helictotrichon capense, Helictotrichon longifolium, Helictotrichon longum and Helictotrichon turgidulum have a combination of small prickles and papillae whilst Helictotrichon galpinii and Helictotrichon natalense have a combination of all three. A key to the groups and photos of the different types of surfaces are provided.Conclusion: The micromorphology of the lemma surface was shown to be of considerable taxonomic significance and to be extremely useful for differentiating amongst species.",

    "abstract": "Background: Urban landscapes present an important opportunity for pollinator conservation, but little is known about the status and distribution of pollinator populations in urban habitats in Africa. This represents a major gap in the development of a global understanding of urban pollinators – particularly from the rapidly urbanising context. This study uses a speciose clade of flower-visiting beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Hopliini) to explore patterns of pollinator distribution in a major metropolitan area in South Africa. Objectives: We investigated community composition across gradients of urban intensity (defined according to the percentage of soil-sealing within 1 km2 of each sampling location) and socio-economic status to determine pollinator responses to these urban landscape effects. Methods: A selection of 142 sites were surveyed twice in the austral spring seasons of 2018 and 2019. Data were collected on habitat structure, flower diversity, and pollinator diversity. Results: The study found that different feeding guilds of monkey beetles favoured different levels of urban intensity and that beetle richness significantly correlated with flower richness. It did not, however, correlate with diversity indicating that abundance is less impacted than the number of species present. Monkey beetles with moderate sensitivity to urban intensity benefitted from the presence of preferred species of flowers. Conclusion: Overall, the findings demonstrate the importance of plant community assemblage in supporting urban monkey beetles. We recommend landscaping with preferred flower species in urban parks to support urban pollinators.",

    "abstract": "Background: South Africa is an important centre of cycad diversity in Africa, however, the country’s cycads face extinction. Among the primary causes is the poaching of plants from the wild, even within protected areas. Objectives: This study examined poaching patterns in a local population of the Endangered Encephalartos eugene-maraisii I.Verd. and how it might affect the population structure, sex ratios, as well as interactions with associated insects. Methods: The population was surveyed in 2008 and 40% of this population was resurveyed between 2021 and 2022. We mapped missing cycads and generated heatmaps. Lastly, we investigated whether the proportion of stems from different size classes, sex ratios and abundance of insect associates varied between areas with a high and low poaching incidence. Results: Poaching, defined as the illegal removal of individuals from the wild, occurred 1.5 times more frequently along the border fence line than areas further away. Medium-sized stems (21–80 cm) are primarily targeted (likely as they can be carried more easily) and low proportions of these stems remain in areas with a high poaching incidence. While E. eugene-maraisii exhibits some resilience against poaching through basal suckering, it takes several decades for suckers to mature and replace harvested stems. No effect on sex ratios were recorded in areas with a high poaching incidence, suggesting poachers have not deliberately selected female or male cycads at this site. No pollinating insects were detected on E. eugene-maraisii, and no seedlings were observed. Conclusion: Cone production may be too rare in diminished populations to support pollinators that utilise cones as brood sites. The presence of insects that use other plant parts, including leaves, dried leaf stalks and cycad trunks, in the larger population suggests that they are more resilient to diminishing host populations. However, these insects were absent in smaller populations, and their abundances were lower in low-density sites and smaller clump sizes of their host in the larger population. This suggests these insects may be vulnerable to the decline of their host populations due to poaching.",

The proportion of polyploid cells in the meristem of single adventitious roots is significantly higher than in meristems of primary and secondary roots. This may lead to a complete polyploidisation of adventitious roots. Innovation shoots display a low percentage of polyploid cells, comparable to the condition found in primary and secondary roots. Nevertheless cells of different euploid levels are frequently found. During field studies, however, individuals of a given population were always found to have the same chromosome number: infraspecific polyploidy was found in only three out of 305 investigated stapeliad species. Genera with an orthotropic growth form were found to be diploid throughout, whereas the genera of which the members spread vegetatively by means of innovation shoots, comprise di-, tetra- and polyploid species.

    "abstract": "A phytosociological study based on the collection of vegetation and environmental data from 53 randomly stratified sample plots on Signal Hill, Cape Town, was carried out over an area of 124 ha. The survey extended over 12 months to ensure the inclusion of as many plant species as possible, and a list of the vascular plant species was compiled. A total of 81 families, 255 genera and 460 species was identified. The phytosociological method revealed that only one major plant community occurs in the study area and two subcommunities, with a total of five variants correlated mostly with aspect and historic land use, were identified. The perennially and seasonally identifiable species were analysed separately to determine their relative contribution to the phytosociological classification. The two data sets gave similar classifications. A vegetation map as well as a soil map was compiled.",

They occur on the culms, rachises and secondary ramifications of the inflorescence. The glands are bicellular structures with endodermal tissue at the base. They consist of a basal cell and an apical cell, which is a collecting chamber with a large pore at the top. It is proposed to conserve the term salt gland to designate excretory structures associated with endodermal collecting tissue. The elements present in the glands (detected by the use of X-ray micro-analysis) are: Na. Mg. P. S. Cl. K with an increase of the elements from the endodermal tissue to the cap cell. Because of energy needed to transport and excrete salts, salt glands are situated at the base of the inflorescence, which is the zone of maximal development of Kranz structure. It is inferred that Eriochloa is a facultative halophytic genus, derived recently from a halophytic ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Pollen grains of the Euphorbiaceae show a number of pollen types which can be clearly distinguished. Generally different genera are characterized by a specific pollen type. Euphorbia obesa Hook. f. and Croton gratissimus Burch, subsp. subgratissimus (Prain) Burtt Davy, represent two genera within the Crotonoideae with different morphology, each type characteristic for the respective genus. Taxonomically, the genus Euphorbia with apetalous flowers consisting of a naked pistil surrounded by several staminate flowers within a cyathium, is considered more advanced than the genus Croton. In Croton the inflorescence is a raceme with unisexual flowers. The floral whorls of the male show numerous anthers and both calyx and a showy corolla are present. Both genera are insect pollinated. In both Euphorbia obesa and Croton gratissimus the pollen wall in section shows columellae, a structure characteristic of angiosperms. However the present ontogenetic studies show that the formation of the columellae differs entirely in the two pollen types. The final stratification of the wall as well as the morphology of the grains differ and evaluation of the exine structure indicates that phylogenetically Croton pollen shows more advanced characters than Euphorbia — contradicting the floral phylogeny. This study conducted at light and electron microscope level compares the two pollen types morphologically and ontogenetically, concentrating mainly on the formation of the exine which is tectate-perforate in the prolate tricolpate grain of Euphorbia obesa and semi-tectate in the anaperturate, spheroidal grain of Croton gratissimus. The aim of the study was to evaluate the significance of pollen characters in taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships within the Euphorbiaceae. The differing pollen morphology which is related to the taxonomic grouping of tribes within the subfamily (Crotonoideae) emphasizes diversity, which may result from physiological adaptation. The study shows that the same functional end may well be achieved in different ways and this may be a factor underlying the diversity in the heterogeneous family Euphorbiaceae.",

Most of the sampled vegetation was classified as coastal fynbos. The Leucadendron salignum-Tetraria cuspidata Fynbos Community was found to occupy sheltered habitats, whereas the Relhania calyci- na-Passerina vulgaris Fynbos Community was found in exposed habitats The other two communities characterise strong­ly exposed rocky headlands. The Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus-Ruschia tenella Community is wind-sheared scrub, and the Gazania rigens- Limonium scabrum Rocky Headland Community is a loose-canopy, low-grown herbland, characterised by the occurrence of partly salt-tolerant and succulent herbs. The ordination of the fynbos communities revealed a horseshoe structure allowing a direct recognition of a coenocline spanning two fynbos communities along the Axis 1 interpreted in terms of exposure to wind and salt spray. A considerable amount of alien plant infestation was also present. This appears to be the largest threat to the continued existence of this coastal fynbos.",

    "abstract": "The Didiereaceae, endemic to the arid south-west of Madagascar is one of the most remarkable plant families in the world. Four genera and 11 species are known, of which 3 have been described by the author: Decaryia (1 species), Alluaudiopsis (2 spp.), Alluaudia (6 spp.) and Didierea (2 spp.). The species show different growth forms, but their shoot-stem-systems are basically similar; they are all spiny, semi-succulent deciduous shrubs or trees, with a stem (shoot) system differentiated into long-shoots and short-shoots (brachyblasts). The long shoots bear normal leaflets, which soon fall off. In their axils, brachyblasts develop proleptically, which produce two types of leaves (1) thorns which develop proleptically in different numbers (1 in Alluaudia, 2 in Alluaudiopsis marnieriana and several Didierea)-, (2) leaves which are green, deciduous assimilation organs (2 per brachyblast in Alluaudia, several in Didierea). The stem organization is comparable to that of the Cactaceae of the New World. The brachyblasts of the Didiereaceae are homologous to the areoles of the Cactaceae, most obviously to those of the primitive members, the Pereskioideae. The affinities between the two families can be demonstrated by means of grafting. It is possible to graft Didiereas onto Pereskioideae and vice versa. The flower structure of Didiereaceae is very uniform. Flowers are unisexual and dioecious and show affinities to those of the Portulacaceae. The development of the gynoecium, the ovule and the female gametophyte as well as the presence of betalains in the flowers indicate that the Didiereaceae do not belong to the Sapindales as was sometimes assumed, but to the Centrospermae. They should be placed between Portulacaceae and Cactaceae. The ancestors of the Didiereaceae are not known.",

Leaves in Passerina are inversely ericoid, the adaxial surface concave and the abaxial surface convex. Leaves are inversely dorsiventral and epistomatic. The adaxial epidermis is villous, with unicellular, uniseriate trichomes and relatively small thin-walled cells, promoting flexibility of leaf margins owing to turgor changes. In common with many other Thymelaeaceae, abaxial epidermal cells are large and tanniniferous with mucilaginous cell walls. The cuticle is adaxially thin, but abaxially well devel­oped, probably enabling the leaf to restrict water loss and to tolerate high light intensity and UV-B radiation. Epicuticular waxes, present in all species, comprise both soft and plate waxes. Epidermal structure proves to be taxonomically impor­tant at family, genus and species levels. Interspecific differences include arrangement of stomata and presence or absence of abaxial epidermal hair. Other diagnostic characters of the abaxial epidermal cells are arrangement,size and shape, cutic- ular ornamentation and presence or absence of wax platelets. Two groups of species on the basis of abaxial epidermal cell orientation are recognised. Many leaf epidermal features in Passerina are interpreted as structural adaptations to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape.",

For the cryptogams and monocots there are 77 newly described species or infraspecific taxa, 27 names brought back into use, and nine species newly reported for southern Africa, resulting in 113 additions to the total list of species. Five species were removed because they were mistakenly recorded from the area. Seventy-five names have gone into synonymy, there are 52 new combinations, and there are 35 orthographic corrections, resulting in 237 alterations to the list of species.

A total of 101 woody species over one inch d.b.h. was encountered, with a range of 20 to 40 species per stand. Quantitative results, including numbers and sizes, are given for canopy, subcanopy, and understorey species as they occurred in these various layers. Specific size limits were used to recognize the three layers, thus putting all stands on a comparable basis. Relative basal area per acre figures ueie used as an indication of the relative dominance of the various species and layers, and the possibility of a biological principle to justify such usage is mentioned. Although the stands are complex and are seemingly heterogeneous, there are definite patterns of species behaviour, and trends aie indicated for the 10 stands and for the four forest areas. Relatively few species are dominant in each stand and the apparent diversity is mainly due to the high percentage of species that are relatively uncommon in each stand. The methods described in this paper should be applicable in a study of a broader range of Natal forests, an area from which quantitative studies have heretofore been virtually absent.lly absent.",

The Pretoria (PRE) Computerised Information System (PRECIS) of the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), provided three sets of South Afncan plant richness data, overall (OPR), endemic (EPR), and threatened (TPR), to investigate the relationships between richness and six anthropogenic variables. Spearman’s Rank order correlations, Kruskal Wallis Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Generalized Linear Models (GLZ) were used. Although all three plant richness measures were correlated with anthropogenic variables, individual anthropogenic variables contributed a small fraction to the explained variation in richness. Differences in spatial and temporal scaling of the datasets, or the response to another causal mechanism, may have contributed to this low explained variation. Because more variation was accounted for in OPR than EPR or TPR, OPR is a more suitable surrogate measure of plant biodiversity when investigating the anthropogenic variables used here. Average human density (HD), infrastructure (degree of urbanization and road cover) (LRU) and percentage land area transformed and degraded (LTD) were identified as useful surrogates of human impacts on OPR. LTD may be a more inclusive human impact measure when conducting analyses of human impacts using OPR. LTD includes the effects of urban expansion, road networks and other land transformation impacts, such as agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Background: Akkerendam Nature Reserve is the second oldest proclaimed municipal nature reserve in the Northern Cape, yet to date no vegetation map has been produced. The possible expansion of the reserve is under consideration.Objectives: To produce a vegetation map, classification and description of the vegetation of the reserve and proposed expansion area, and assess how the vegetation has changed over the past century.Method: Braun Blanquet methodology was used to produce a vegetation map. To quantify vegetation change, (1) relevés (a plot of phytosociological data) composed from Acocks’ species lists, recorded in 1954 and 1956, were compared with the phytosociological table, and (2) recent repeat photographs (2016) were compared to four images taken by Pole Evans (ca. 1920).Results: Three plant communities were identified within the reserve and expansion area; however, four subcommunities are only found in the proposed expansion area. Relevés compiled from Acocks’ species lists were absorbed into the phytosociological table indicating that no significant vegetation change has taken place in the last approximately 60 years. This study found 222 species in common with Acocks’ species lists; however, he did not list the alien invasive species Prosopis glandulosa. Comparison of repeat photographs with images taken nearly a century earlier suggests that, except for the impact of recent fires, the composition remained relatively similar.Conclusion: The phytosociological approach adopted has provided a map of the vegetation units of the study area, while the historical comparisons indicate that the vegetation of Akkerendam Nature Reserve has not undergone significant change over the last 100 years.",

All species are illustrated, and capsule and seed morphology are described for many of the species for the first time. Novel characteristics of the bract, seed, and pollen operculum are used to separate the species into two sections: sect. Brevibracteae Goldblatt J.C.Manning is distinguished by relatively small bracts, 3–8 mm long and uniformly leathery or soft-textured without thickened veins, seeds with filiform chalazal extension, and pollen grains with 1-banded operculum; and sect.

Species in sect. Thereianthus are further segregated into ser. Thereianthus, with heavily ribbed leaves and suberect flowers with arcuate or erect stamens, and ser. Bracteolatus, with plane, inconspicuously veined leaves and ± spreading flowers with declinate stamens. Eleven species are recognized in the genus, all restricted to the southwestern portion of Western Cape. Two new species are described in sect. Thereianthus: T. bulbiferus Goldblatt J.C.Manning, known from three populations along the West Coast, is distinguished by the unique development of cormels in the lower leaf axil, and by its actinomorphic perianth with white marks at the base of each tepal and ± declinate stamens; and T. elandsmontanus Goldblatt J.C.Manning, known from a single population in Elandsberg Nature Reserve near Wellington, has distinctive cream-coloured, moderately long-tubed flowers with unusually narrow, linear tepals heavily marked with purple near the base.

    "abstract": "Romulea pilosa J.C.Manning Goldblatt and R. quartzicola J.C.Manning Goldblatt are two narrow endemics from the southern African winter rainfall region. An early, fragmentary collection of R. pilosa from Riviersonderend lacked the diagnostic corm and was thus mistakenly associated with R. tetragona (sect. Ciliatae) as var. flavandra M.P.de Vos because of the highly distinctive pilose, H-shaped leaf. The rediscovery of the taxon in the wild shows it to be a previously unrecognized member of sect. Aggregatae, distinguished by its unusual foliage and bright orange flowers. R. quartzicola was grown to flowering from seeds collected from quartz patches in southern Namaqualand and proved to be a new species of sect. Ciliatae, distinguished by its early flowering, short, subclavate leaves with reduced sclerenchyma strands, and bright yellow flowers with short bracts. R. neglecta M.P.de Vos, a rare endemic from the Kamiesberg in Northern Cape, is a later homonym for the Mediterranean R. neglecta Jord. Fourr., and the earliest name for this plant is shown to be R. speciosa (Ker Gawl.) Baker, typified by an illustration in Andrews’ The botanist’s repository. An epitype is designated to fix the application of the name. We have also examined the type illustration of R. pudica (Sol. ex Ker Gawl.) Baker, hitherto treated as an uncertain species, and are confident that it represents the species currently known as R. amoena Schltr. ex Bég., and takes priority over it as being the earlier name. The type of R. reflexa Eckl., a new name for the later homonym I. reflexa Thunb. and the basionym of R. rosea var. reflexa (Eckl.) Bég., has been mistakenly identified as an Ecklon collection but is in fact the collection that formed the basis of Thunberg’s I. reflexa. This collection is actually a form of R. flava Lam., and the name R. rosea var. reflexa is thus moved to the synonomy of that species. The variety currently known under this name should now be known as R. rosea var. muirii (N.E.Br.) Goldblatt J.C.Manning. Finally, the protologue of R. parviflora Eckl., until now treated under the synonomy of R. obscura Klatt var. obscura, is in fact consistent with R. rosea var. australis (Ewart) M.P.de Vos, and we therefore include the name in the synonomy of the latter.",

    "abstract": "A review of the chromosome cytology of the African and Eurasian geophytic genus Moraea Mill. (currently 214 spp.); including 51 new counts, many for taxa poorly known cytologically or not counted before, that shows that 167 species, representing 78% of the total, have been counted from one or more populations. The inferred ancestral base number is x = 10. Polyploidy is relatively rare; available counts indicate that both Eurasian species are tetraploid, but that, among the sub-Saharan species, just nine species (less than 5%) are exclusively polyploid and an additional 15 (7%) have diploid and polyploid populations. Chromosome rearrangement leading to reduced base numbers has occurred in subg. Polyanthes (x = 10), in which four sections have a base number of x = 6. Three subgenera, Grandiflorae, Homeria and Vieusseuxia, also have x = 6, but have different karyotypes. Several species and one subspecies are dysploid, all but one with haploid numbers lower than in related species, and are neodysploids. Except for M. virgata subsp. karooica, dysploidy is interpreted as descending. Fourteen species have diploid and polyploid populations, notably M. crispa (subg. Polyanthes) and M. cookii (subg. Homeria), in which the distribution of populations with 2n = 12, 24 and 36 is correlated with geography. Seven species have euploid and dysploid populations at the diploid level and M. inclinata has populations with 2n = 12 and 22. Differences in chromosome number within species are not normally reflected in external morphology. Compared to most other genera of Iridaceae in sub-Saharan Africa, chromosome number and karyotype are unusually variable so that sampling of multiple populations of species is required to establish these characters. Although many species remain to be examined cytologically, those uncounted are mostly in the species-rich subg. Grandiflorae and subg. Vieusseuxia, both of which exhibit little variation in chromosome number and karyotype. Chromosome rearrangement and polyploidy appear to have been important in the early evolution of the genus as well as in recent speciation.",

    "abstract": "The tropical north-east African mountains are tentatively divided into four phytochoria, the formal rank of which is not defined. The division is based on patterns of distribution and endemism in the region. The recognition of a distinct Afromontane phytochorion is now well established (Chapman White, 1970; Werger, 1978; White, 1978). However, there is still very little information on the phytogeography of the individual mountains or mountain systems. This study hopes to fill a little of the gap by analysing distribution patterns and patterns of endemism in the flora of the tropical north-east African mountains. The north-east African mountain system is the largest in tropical Africa (see e.g. map in White, 1978). At the core of this system is the large Ethiopian massif, around which are located various mountains and mountain chains. These include the Red Sea Hills in the Sudan, the mountain chain in northern Somalia, the south-west Arabian mountains, and the Imatong mountains of south-east Sudan. The latter are often referred to the East African mountain system (White, 1978) but. as I will point out later, they also have a close connection with the south-west highlands of Ethiopia. The paper presents some results of my study of the mountain flora of tropical north-east Africa, particularly the forest species. Where no source is indicated, the data are from my own unpublished studies.",

They are: the continuing importance of traditional medicine; the importance of the spoken word in handing down traditional botanical and medical knowledge; the richness and diversity of the African flora; and the many different languages and dialects used by the African people. Some of the plants used in African traditional medicine are being investigated as sources of antibiotics and other useful substances.

It resembled belts presently occurring above the treeline and was possibly widespread over the plains of the Transvaal during the last glacial maximum period. In the central parts of the province, warm semi-arid savanna subsequently expanded during the early Holocene and was followed by a more broad-leafed type of woodland in the late Holocene. This change probably resulted from slightly wetter and, at times, also slightly warmer and cooler conditions.",

    "abstract": "A comparative anatomical study was made of the genus Passerina comprising 20 species and four subspecies, most of which are endemic to southern Africa. It showed that anatomical variation is useful in species recognition and classification. Anatomical characters typical of Thymelaeaceae and displayed in Passerina include isobilateral leaves, a papillate cuticular membrane, mucilaginous epidermal cell walls, a parenchymatous bundle sheath and extraxylary sclerenchyma fibres. Vascular bundles of the leaf lack intraxylary phloem. Characters common to Passerina are inverse-dorsiventral and epis- tomatic leaves, inverted palisade parenchyma and an abaxial hvpodermal sclerenchymatous sheath. Orientation of the main vascular bundle in relation to the epidermis and mesophyll allows the recognition of four leaf structural types and ten states, according to which all species can be characterized and grouped. Functionally many anatomical features of the leaf in Passerina are interpreted as adaptations to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape Floristic Region, where most species occur.",

In the present work we have evaluated some structural-functional approaches that could be used to classify and describe fynbos. A priori and a posteriori approaches to classification are reviewed. The a posteriori approach appears to be superior.Test data derived from 21 plots from a range of fynbos types were used to test some methods of collecting and analysing structural-functional information for an a posteriori classification. With respect to data collection, no single method was superior. However, a major improvement on our methodology would be possible if the growth-form system used were to be extended. The classifications that were erected were produced by means of computer-based numerical methods. These methods are essential if large data sets are to be analysed. However, the structural-functional classifications produced by numerical methods should only be regarded as working hypotheses; refinement of the classifications should proceed by intuitive methods. We feel that the a posteriori approach, even though it has its problems, will provide a suitable methodology for an ecologically meaningful classification of fynbos vegetation.",

The upper and lower surface imprints of a single leaf found on a split fragment of carbonaceous shale provides the main evidence presented. The finely striated upper surface imprint of the leaf could be identified with Rubidgea, whereas the lower surface imprint represents the typical strong venation of a Glossopteris. The type species of Rubidgea is transferred to Glossopteris as G. mackayi (Tate) Kovacs comb. nov.

A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for CBB resistance was performed under natural infection conditions, using a mapping population of 99 full-sibs genotypes highly segregant and a SNP-based high dense genetic map. The phenotypic evaluation was carried out in Puerto Lopez, Meta, Colombia, during the rainy season in 2015. Both resistant and susceptible transgressive segregants were detected in the mapping population. Through a non-parametric interval mapping analysis, two QTL were detected, explaining 10.9 and 12.6 % of phenotypic variance of resistance to field CBB. After a bioinformatics exploration four genes were identified in the QTL intervals. This work represents a contribution to the elucidation of the molecular bases of quantitative cassava resistance to Xam .",

This included a study of the habit, phyllotaxis, morphology and anatomy of the leaves and flowers, pollen morphology and karyology. No major differences were found between the two genera. The range of variation of certain diagnostic characters of these genera is such that the genera merge into each other. It was concluded that the two genera are congeneric and the inclusion of Cryptadenia within Lachnaea is proposed.",

Molecular genetics, phytochemistry and host-parasite relationships have indicated a relationship between this woody, pantropical tribe of Flacourtiaceae and a small, trigeneric family of herbaceous, southern African endemics, the Achariaceae. In the present study, ovule and seed structure in Kiggelaria were investigated and compared with relevant data recently reported for Achariaceae. Support for an alliance with Achariaceae were found in the presence of anatropous, bitegmic. sessile ovules with zigzag micropyles. deep-lying embryo sacs covered by an epistase in the ovule and seed, endotestal-exotegmic seed coat layers, suspensorless embryos and sarcotestal seed with a prominent, plate-like hypostase. Unlike Achariaceae. Kiggelaria seeds do not have chalazal seed lids, pronounced raphal ridges, a fringe layer, or stomata in the outer epidermis of the sarcotesta. Structural dissimilarities in seeds of omithochorous Kiggelaria and myrmeco- chorous Achariaceae were regarded as adaptations linked to adifferent strategies for seed germination and dispersal.",

We visited and worked on the U. caffer collections of three of these museums to confirm the taxonomic identity of their specimens and gather occurrence records. We also extracted the distributional records from the two published maps, and plotted all these records using the geographic information system, ESRI ArcGIS.Results: The distribution map based on the museum records showed that this species occurred in all nine provinces of the country, thus revealing a much broader historical occurrence than previous known.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the crucial function of museums, natural history collections in facilitating understanding about biodiversity patterns using U. caffer distribution as an example. However, as museum records mainly show historical occurrence, there is a need to conduct further studies to assess the current population trends of this species. Although the current International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conservation assessment of this species is Least Concern, pressures on native fish, which host the larval stages of this mussel, and the declining environmental conditions of rivers in the country may affect the conservation status in the near future.",

The flies were identified using standard barcoding (Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I [COI] gene sequence) and, in some cases, additional identification from a taxonomical expert using morphological traits. Species were checked against literature, online resources and a previously compiled library of South African Drosophilidae to determine whether they were new records.Results: Thirteen species were readily collected and identified. Of these, three species (Drosophila ananassae, Drosophila nasuta and Zaprionus taronus) have not been reported previously in South Africa. One of the species (Z. taronus) was captured in a home garden, while the other two species were captured in an urban-agricultural region with a sub-tropical climate.Conclusions: From our limited serendipitous sampling, three new species records have been found in sub-tropical climates in South Africa. With more comprehensive, systematic sampling, a better understanding of the South African Drosophilidae composition, and thus the detection of alien or invasive species, can be pursued. Baseline data for understanding spatio-temporal patterns of native biodiversity, or for informing management actions in the case of alien or invasive species, are currently inadequate for this group in the region.",

This invasive plant is also reducing the availability of medicinal plants andother natural resources.Conclusions: Mimosa diplotricha has the potential to significantly expand its range in eastern Africa, and parts of southern Africa, and as such there is an urgent need to develop and implement an integrated management strategy, including biological control, to reduce the negative effects of this invasive plant on local livelihoods.",

Crocoideae by the style dividing into relatively long, usually laxly spreading style branches at or shortly below the mouth of the perianth tube (rarely well within the tube or above the mouth of the tube) and, with a few exceptions, by hard, woody corm tunics. We describe three new species here. H. dolomitica Goldblatt J.C.Manning, a narrow endemic of limestone outcrops on slopes north of the Vars River in the Knersvlakte, Western Cape, has the bell-shaped corms characteristic of the small sect. Hesperantha but is distinctive in the section in its pure white perianth with relatively long tube and soft-textured, falcate to distally trailing leaves. H. laxifolia Goldblatt J.C.Manning from the Pakhuis Mtns, Western Cape, stands out in sect. Hesperantha in its prostate, somewhat succulent foliage leaves, and spikes of 2–5 white flowers with unusually short filaments less than 1 mm long and particularly short anthers, ± 4 mm long. The short style branches, ± 4 mm long, remain suberect rather than laxly spreading. H. secunda Goldblatt J.C.Manning from the Roggeveld Escarpment, Northern Cape, has until now been included in H. pilosa but differs in its secund spike of nodding flowers with short style branches, and leaves with broadly winged margins. We also recognize a new subsp. bracteolata (R.C.Foster) Goldblatt J.C.Manning of H. pilosa (L.f.) Ker Gawl. for populations of plants with diurnal flowers with usually blue or purple (occasionally white) tepals lacking dark pigmentation on the reverse. With additional material to hand, we reduce blue-flowered H. ciliolata Goldblatt to synonymy in subsp. bracteolata and report range extensions for H. pilosa subsp. pilosa, now recorded as far east as the Langeberg near Cloete’s Pass.",

The pollen morphology of sixteen species was studied with light, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Pollen grains of Boerhavia and Commicarpus are uniform in shape and sculpturing. Grains are spheroidal and pantoporate, and the tectum tubuliferous and spinulose. Pollen grains of the Boerhavia are 52–91 μm in diameter and those of Commicarpus 52–129 μm. Spinules in both genera are 1–5 μm long. Pore plates have one or two spinules. In both genera the exine is 3.5–11.5 μm thick, the tectum 0.9–3.9 μm thick and the collumellae 0.6–2.8 μm long. Foot layers are 0.9–5.1 μm thick and the endexine is barely visible. Size variation of the pollen grain, pore diameter and exine thickness overlap and cannot be used to distinguish between the two genera or the individual species.",

The stigmata are never exposed to pollinating agents, which gain access to the floral rewards by forcing their way between the anthers. Clogging of the stigmatic surfaces by self-pollen is common. Nocturnal anthesis, concomitant with the nocturnal release of attractants and the offering of rewards, indicates that this species is primarily phalaenophilous and secondarily melittophilous, exhibiting a bimodal pollination system.",

The specimen was identified at the National Herbarium (Pretoria).Results: This is not only a new distribution record for the quarter degree grid (QDS: 2229BA), but is also the first record of this grass in the Limpopo Province. The population of S. transiens has already been fragmented and partially destroyed because of mining activities and is under serious threat of total destruction.Conclusion: It is proposed that the population of S. transiens must be considered to be of conservation significance, and the population should be made a high priority in the overall environmental management programme of the mining company that owns the land.",

Specimens of the two species in the National Herbarium, Pretoria were examined to verify the identity in the case of G. coloratum, and to document additional records in Namibia for F. sur.Results: Ficus sur was recorded from two localities, and a third locality based on a specimen in the National Herbarium, Pretoria, was verified. Gymnanthemum coloratum, a member of the Asteraceae, was recorded from a single locality.Conclusion: The fact that F. sur was collected at more than one location in the Kaokoveld suggests that it is probably more widespread in suitable microhabitats. Ficus sur also occurs further north in Angola, suggesting that the Kaokoveld plants represent a cross-border outlier of the much more widespread Angolan population.

EnglishThe forms of spatial and temporal resources use of two sympatric species of Ameivula were studied in an Atlantic Forest-Caatinga ecotone located in Parque Nacional Serra de Itabaiana, Sergipe, Brazil. The study was conducted between February 2008 and January 2009. The method used was an active search for a limited time, from 06:00 am to 06:00 pm. The species were observed during all months sampled, and A. ocellifera presented the highest number of sightings. Despite the high temporal niche overlap observed (Ojk = 0.90), A. ocellifera and A. abaetensis differed regarding the times of higher activity. A. ocellifera was most seen (≥ 10%) between 08:00 am and 01:00 pm, and A. abaetensis from 09:00 am to 01:00 pm. Both species were found more frequently on sunny days, with similar patterns of activity at the time of sighting, being usually observed walking on sand (A. ocellifera) or leaves near the base of shrubs (A. abaetensis). The behaviors demonstrated by both species of Ameivula in response to the approach of the observer were different and were related to the level of exposure along with the vulnerability to predation. The coexistence of A. ocellifera and A. abaetensis in the study area is possibly related to minor differences in the use pattern of temporal and spatial resources by both species, and these differences are probably due to the current ecological interactions. The results obtained in this study contribute to the understanding of the natural history and ecology of the species of Ameivula and mainly generate useful information for the conservation of these species in habitats transitional of Atlantic Forest-Caatinga. portuguesAs formas de utilizacao dos recursos espaciais e temporais por duas especies simpatricas de Ameivula foram estudadas em um ecotono de Mata Atlântica e Caatinga, situado no Parque Nacional Serra de Itabaiana, Sergipe, Brasil.

Confusion relating to the differences between the two subspecies currently included under P. reniforme has impeded attempts to assess their conservation status. Pelargonium reniforme is closely related to Pelargonium sidoides; the two species are indistinguishable when not flowering and their distributions overlap in some areas.Objectives: With this study, we aimed to clarify the taxonomic status of the two subspecies of P. reniforme, which has relevance in terms of their conservation status.Method: Leaf shape, petiole length, internode length and flower colour were assessed by studying herbarium specimens of the two subspecies of P. reniforme and specimens of P. sidoides. Living specimens of the two subspecies were also examined in their natural habitat.Results: The current investigation showed that the morphological characters used to distinguish the two subspecies of P. reniforme are too variable to separate them. Variation in some morphological characters may be related to environmental conditions.Conclusion: The recognition of the two subspecies of P. reniforme as distinct taxa is no longer justified.",

The most widely distributed species, Schistostephium crataegifolium, occurs in upland or montane areas towards the eastern side of the continent.Objectives: The objective of this study was to document a new geographic distribution record of this species from the Bié Plateau of central Angola.Method: Specimens of S. crataegifolium were collected near Chitembo, Bié Province, during fieldwork for the Future Okavango Project grant 01LL0912A, task SP05, a project aimed at providing scientific support for sustainable land and resource management of the Okavango basin of Angola, Namibia and Botswana. The specimen was identified at the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK.Results: The collection represents a new generic record for Angola, which is disjunct from the nearest population in Katanga by approximately 1000 km.Conclusion: New generic records such as this underline the need for basic botanical inventories in the large, ecologically diverse but poorly documented country of Angola.",

Differences were noted in the gross morphology , in sporangium size, spore size and in the patterning of the outer exospore from the two sites. Coiled structures were associated with the development of the inner perispore in spores collected from the Transvaal, whereas dense, heterogeneous bodies were associated with the formation of this layer in spores from the Cape. Differences were also noted in the organisation of the tapetum. A cellular, parietal tapetum and a plasmodial tapetum were present in the Cape material when the spores had developed the sculptured outer exospore. In sporangia from the Transvaal, however, only a plasmodial tapetum was present at the same stage of sporoderm development. A detailed study of S. pectinata throughout its distribution is required to determine the taxonomic importance of these findings.",

    "abstract": "THE FLORA IN THE SOUTHERN SAHARA MOUNTAIN MASSES: ILLUSIVE AND TRUE ENDEMIC SPECIES The mountain masses in the southern part of the Sahara, namely Hoggar, Tassili n 'Ajjer, Air, Tibesti, Ennedi, Jebel Marra and Gebel Elba, have fascinated botanists to such an extent that there has been successive and even multiple creation of new species. This situation can be partly explained by the fact that those who were interested in these areas, although undoubtedly world experts in the Mediterranean area, have less knowledge of the African tropical flora. As a result, certain botanical literature, some quite recent, abounds in binomials, some merely synonyms of older names of well-known species. The problem is aggravated by the fact that a number of authors do not keep up with recent literature. A breakdown of the 85 species previously accepted as endemics reveals that: 37 were incorrectly identified (Table I) ; 7 changed their names either for systematic or nomenclatural reasons (Table 2); I is known only from the type (Quezelia) and requires further collection; 31 belong to difficult genera and require further study (p. 513); and 9 are true endemics (p. 514). This study shows that the number of endemic species from the mountainous enclaves in the dry northern-tropical areas is considerably lower than previously estimated. With more material and with the aid of distribution maps, it is now possible to put the number of true endemics at 12 species.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific variability in Alloteropsis semialata (R. Br.) Hitchc. is shown ultrastructurally with particular regard to the structure of the bundle sheath and the development of the dimorphic chloroplasts in both the C3 and C4 forms of this species. A. semialata is known to possess two distinct anatomical forms — Kranz and non-Kranz — within one species and occurring within a single ecological niche. Kranz and non-Kranz anatomy is known to be correlated with C3 and C4 physiology respectively. Transverse sections of leaf portions taken at midsheath, at the ligule and at midlamina show plastids with different morphologies at different ontogenetic stages. Plastid form is related to the stage of development, the influence of light on the emerging leaf and the C3 or C4form of A. semialata. Stages from amyloplast to chloroplast are investigated with regard to fine structure. Leaf transverse sections are examined microscopically and formation of new bundles, chiefly in the lamina is traced. Differences in anatomy and distribution of vascular bundles are more evident in the lamina than in the colourless leaf sheath. Both C3 and C4 forms of A. semialata are found to show chloroplast dimorphism in vascular bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. This is shown to differ in the two forms. The specialized chloroplasts of the Kranz sheath are shown to develop in the inner or mestome sheath, and not in the parenchyma sheath as in some other members of the Kranz Panicoideae. Features of A. semialata, such as the double bundle sheath, granal chloroplasts and large numbers of mitochondria in bundle sheath cells, in the C4 form, question the current classification of this grass as a malate former.",

The alpine and Cathedral Peak forms have recently been described as M. guillarmodiae Conert (1975). The degree of anatomical differentiation of these “forms” resembles the situation described in M. disticha (Nees) Conert (Ellis, 1980). Populations of both M. stricta and M. disticha from the Drakensberg mountains display extensive anatomical diversification which appears to be correlated with environmental factors. In addition, morphological differences are exhibited as well and the anatomical “forms” of M. stricta probably warrant taxonomic recognition.",

    "abstract": "The family of the Apocynaceae is usually subdivided into two subfamilies, the Plumerioideae with the type genus Plumeria from tropical America, and the Apocynoideae, often named Echitoideae, with the type genus Apocynum from North America. These subfamilies show two characters which are more or less diagnostic for all members. However, since the taxonomists have built up the present scheme of the Apocynaceae, phytochemists have observed that many plants belonging to the Plumerioideae contain alkaloids, and that many representatives of the Apocynoideae contain glycosides. Some of the alkaloids, e.g. those of Catharanthus, Rauvolfia and Voacanga, and some of the glycosides, e.g. those of Funtumia and Strophanthus are of medicinal interest. In the present paper, the arrangement of the genera within the Plumerioideae is mainly that of Pichon (1949, 1950, 1953a, 1953b). He subdivided all tribes, except the Tabernaemontaneae, into subtribes, which is an excellent concept according to the present author. The latter, however, does not always agree with the delimitation of the genera. For instance, he does not accept the sinking of Acokanthera under Carissa, especially as the plants belonging to these genera show great differences in architecture (Hallé Oldeman 1970; Hallé, Oldeman Tomlinson, 1978), but he sinks several genera maintained by Pichon, e.g. Ervatamia under Tabernaemontana (1976).",

Moench in an attempt to acquire a more complete and meaningful understanding of the taxonomy, classification, origin and evolution of Africa's most valuable cultivated crop. This work has, however, been restricted mainly to the sorghums in northern and central Africa, with southern Africa largely excluded. In this paper, the morphological variation and distribution of cultivated sorghum races in South Africa is introduced, together with comments on the classification of cultivated sorghums. A new morphological character, the groove at the base of the lower glume of mature, sessile spikelets (developed from a zone of weak, membranous tissue observable in immature spikelets) is evaluated. The degree of development of this groove varies between the different races and is considered to relate directly to their evolution and domestication.",

    "abstract": "At each of 17 collecting points between Johannesburg and Brits in the Transvaal, three plants which belong to the Eragrostis curvula Complex were collected and studied. A total o f 3 902 embryo sacs was examined in this sample. Of the embryo sacs examined, 3 306 were apomictic by means of diplospory, whereas 99 were sexual monosporic Polygonum-type embryo sacs. One hundred and nineteen embryo sacs were abnormal or divergent, and 378 were degenerated. There are indications that seasonal climatic fluctuations may be responsible for embryo sacs developing abnormally or degenerating. Simple and multiple correlations confirmed that sexual embryo sacs usually do not develop abnormally or degenerate during the later developmental stages. This finding lends credence to both the system of classification of individual embryo sacs and to the validity of the estimate of the proportion of sexuality of the plants sampled at each sampling point.",

In this paper, 29 taxa, representing 12 genera, of the tribe Eragrostideae were examined by mass spectrometry for their δ 13C in dried leaf tissue. All these taxa proved to be C4, plants with δ13C values ranging between -13,6°/oo and -10.9°/oo.

    "abstract": "Many taxa of the family Mesembryanthemaceae show close correlations between distribution and environmental factors, e.g. occurrence on limestone or quartzite only, but few cases have been studied in detail. Recent investigations in anatomy, morphology, life cycles, physiology, and in energetic properties indicate that fundamentally different patterns are developed in adaptation to arid conditions, even in reaction to identical edaphic and climatic factors.On the other hand, little is known about the immediate influence of changes in the natural environment. Studies in populations of the subgenus Cephalophyllum of the genus Cephalophyllum N.E. Br. show strong correlations between precipitation data and habit, which can superimpose genetic dispositions. In addition, growth forms are well adapted to certain types of plant communities, so that superficially, a diffuse structural pattern results.Long term studies, in the field and in the greenhouse, of growth forms in relation to time, to precipitation, and to associations, allow first suggestions for adaptive pathways in the evolution of the group, and the results form a basis for taxonomic decisions in this highly confused taxon. Finally, the example offers aspects for the better understanding of interaction between ecology and distribution data.",

The species has two leaves, a divaricately branching inflorescence, ebracteolate pedicels, and acti- nomorphic flowers with monomorphic anthers. It is endemic to the western parts of central and northern Namibia. Other species of Cyanella have several leaves, racemose inflorescences, bracteolate pedicels, zygomorphic flowers with dimor­phic anthers, and are endemic or near-endemic to the winter rainfall region in southwestern South Africa and southern Namibia. These differences are consistent with the recognition of the species as a distinct genus within the family. Phylogenetic analysis of plastid DNA sequences indicates that C. amboensis Schinz is sister to the other species of Cyanella, a relationship that also supports its independent generic status. The monotvpic genus Eremiolirion is according­ly erected to accommodate the species. Minor differences in flower colour and vegetative morphology in Cyanella alba L.f. are shown to correlate with the three disjunct groups of populations in which the species occurs, and these populations are recognized at the level of subspecies.",

    "abstract": "A member of Iridaceae subfamily Crocoideae. Babiana Ker Gawl. comprises some 80 species from southern Africa. Field studies have shown the need for several taxonomic and nomenclatural changes, while a number of new species have been discovered. The type of B flabellifolia Harv. ex Klatt is a short-tubed plant that matches B. truncata GJ.Lewis. and that name falls into synonymy. The name B. flabellifolia sensu GJ.Lewis (1959) has been misapplied to long-tubed plants from the western Karoo which are now renamed B. praemorsa sp. nov. In addition. B. truncata, as originally circumscribed, included two species, one short-tubed and a second with a longer tube, which we describe here as B. cuneata sp. nov. The type off? hypogaea Burch, has also been misinterpreted and matches the species described as B.flavida. which thus falls into the synonymy of B hypogaea. A second species. B.falcata GJ.Lewis. closely matches this species and is also reduced to synonymy. The widespread southern African species long known as B hypogaea (hypogea sensu GJ.Lewis) matches the type ol B. bainesii Baker and must now be known by that name. Babiana stricta var. erectifolia (GJ.Lewis) GJ.Lewis is appropriately included in typical B. stricta (Aiton) Ker Gawl. However, var. regia GJ.Lewis is a very different plant and is treated as a separate species. B. regia comb, et stat. nov.. as is long-tubed var. grandiflora GJ.Lewis. which is described as the new species, B. longiflora sp. nov. Plants included in B. stricta var. sulphurea sensu GJ.Lewis are also included in var. stricta. We are unable to match the type of Gladiolus sulphureus Jacq.. basionym of var. sulphurea (Jacq.) Baker, with any known species and the name is thus excluded. Lastly, the name B. disticha Ker Gaw l., type of the genus, is superfluous for Gladiolus fragrans Jacq. and the new combination B fragrans comb. nov. is made, reducing B. disticha to synonymy. Babiana fragrans Eckl., which was thought to prevent the transfer of G. fragrans. is a nomen nudum and thus invalid and cannot be taken into account in considerations of nomenclatural priority.",

However, implementation has been problematic due to limited information concerning forest product utilization. This paper investigates and quantifies timber use from the Mngazana Mangrove Forest. Eastern Cape Province. South Africa. Three local communities utilize stems of the mangrove species Rhizophora mucronata Lam. and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. for building construction. There were two distinct building shapes, circular and rectangular. On average. 155 stems were used for circular buildings and 378 stems for rectangular buildings. Most buildings were constructed using mangroves as well as indigenous timber from coastal scarp forests. The proportion of mangrove stems in buildings varied from 0 to 95%. The annual demand for mangroves was estimated to be 18 400 stems. Due to the high annual demand, projected human population growth rates have a minor influence upon future demand values. For effective sustainable forest management, the standing stock at Mngazana should be restricted to the two mangrove species utilized for building construction, and a forest inventory performed so that demand for building can be compared to supply.",

The species presented here have been recorded for South Africa but have not previously been recorded for Lesotho.Objectives: As part of a study aimed at updating biodiversity records of the southern parts of Lesotho (Qacha’s Nek and Quthing districts), with the main focus of compiling a checklist for the Sehlabethebe National Park, this report presents plant species that have until now not been recorded for the Lesotho flora.Method: Several field trips were undertaken between 2004 and 2009. Plant identification was done based on observation and photographic records. After the compilation of the checklist, it became clear that two of the species observed had not been previously recorded for Lesotho. A follow-up trip was carried out in February 2016, during which plant specimens of the presumed new records were collected and deposited at the National University of Lesotho Herbarium (ROML) [and the University of Johannesburg Herbarium (JRAU)]. Plant identification was confirmed by experts in the family Apocynaceae.Results: Two species not previously recorded for Lesotho, namely Ceropegia africana subsp. barklyi and Duvalia caespitosa subsp. caespitosa, were found during the exploration of the southern parts of Lesotho which included the Sehlabathebe National Park.Conclusions: The fact that two species have been recorded in Lesotho for the first time clearly indicates that documentation of the flora of Lesotho needs to be updated. This work is therefore regarded as complementary to previous publications on the Lesotho flora.",

Previous studies in South Africa placed two species of Rhynchosia in this section. Some authors treated the species as a group rather than a section, to avoid phytogeographical confusion because the section is based on the North American generic name Arcyphyllum.Objectives: To formally remove the South African taxa from section Arcyphyllum and to provide diagnostic features for these taxa, a key to the subspecies, distribution maps and an illustration of their morphological features.Methods: Observations were made on herbarium specimens housed at NH, NU and PRE. Several field trips were undertaken in search of Rhynchosia connata. Morphological and anatomical features were studied and measurements of characters recorded.Results: In South Africa, the section was until now represented by two species, Rhynchosia densiflora (subsp. chrysadenia) and R. connata. These were separated primarily on stem indumentum, stipule shape, petiole length, leaflet shape and apices. However, this study revealed that there are no clear discontinuities between the two taxa apart from the lobes of the uppermost calyx lip, which are connate more than halfway in R. connata and up to halfway in R. densiflora subsp. chrysadenia. Therefore, R. connata is here relegated to varietal level as R. densiflora subsp. chrysadenia var. connata (Baker f.) Jaca &amp; Moteetee.Conclusions: Two varieties of Rhynchosia densiflora subsp. chrysadenia occur in South Africa and are treated as part of the R. densiflora group instead of section Arcyphyllum.",

Three different methods were used to analyse the meiotic chromosome configurations.

Comparison of rainfall and temperature data with those collected at an agricultural research station in the region indicated high variability in the spatial and temporal pattern of precipitation, and an air temperature regime which was influenced by the topography. Analysis of vegetation data revealed a species richness lower than other fynbos communities, but a species turnover of similar magnitude. A list of flowering plants and ferns found in the stand is appended. The soil of Table Mountain Group origin comprised a colluvial A -E horizon with a well defined stone-line, and residual B and C horizons of shale origin.

Differences in pollen grain size, shape, number of apertures and exine pattern, were observed. Principal Component Analysis, using both qualitative and biometric pollen characters, distinguished four groups of species with four different pollen types. Most of the species have a microreticulate exine pattern with either diaperturate or tria- perturate grains. The remaining species have either a rugulate exine pattern with diaperturate grains, or a rugulate-reticu- late exine pattern with thickened (hypertrophied) muri with diaperturate grains. While section Dregeocymbium can be well delimited by the unique thickened muri. and by a significantly larger grain size, no diagnostic pollen traits were found for sections Androcymbium and Erythrostictus. Similarly, although the six northern African species exhibit a microreticulate exine pattern, the high variability observed for this trait in their southern African counterparts, does not follow a geographic pattern.",

Division of the young conidial nucleus and subsequent cell wall formation resulted in a multicellular conidium Conidial cells contained either one, two or four nuclei. As all the conidial nuclei are derived from the single nucleus of the terminal conidiophore cell, the whole conidium is homokaryotic.

    "abstract": "Background: Understanding the movement and displacement of individuals within avian species is important for conservation. Herons, Storks and Egrets are especially important as they are migratory species and are potential indicator species. It is therefore valuable to set life history baselines to understand survival.Objectives: To establish baseline longevity and displacement values for the avian families Ardeidae, Threskiornithidae and Ciconiidae using the South African Bird Ringing Scheme (SAFRING) data for Africa and to highlight gaps in the SAFRING database for these families.Method: We used data archives of ringed and subsequently reported individuals to determine maximum displacement and longevities from the past seven decades for each species within these three families. Displacement was estimated by the straight-line distance between subsequent records for the same individual. Longevity is the measure of time elapsed in records for the same individual.Results: Displacement and longevity data were available for 17 of the 24 species in the focus families. Individuals of most of the species were ringed as nestlings so displacement records may represent dispersal. Displacement ranged from a maximum of 10 114 km for a White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) to 2.5 km for a Little Bittern (Ixobrychus minutus). Several species are poorly sampled, resulting in longevity records of just a few days. Despite that, longevity values were 5 years for 16 species, and the highest value was 25.3 years for a White Stork.Conclusion: It was possible to determine longevity values for most of the species within the three families investigated. Based on the displacement profiles for species with sufficient records, there are large differences in movement between species. Certain common species such as Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea) have very few ringing records, which indicate a need for further species-specific research as the longevity values are not representative. This could greatly benefit studies aiming to use these species as ecosystem health indicators as well as identify which species are at risk.",

Historically, the genus is known to consist of three species, namely, N. brachypus, N. ficifolia and N. mitis; morphological data suggest that these should be reduced to two.Objectives: The aim of this article is to formally sink N. brachypus into the synonymy of N. mitis and to provide the correct typification, diagnostic features, diagnostic key, distribution maps, as well as illustrations of the morphological features of the two species.Methods: Observations were made on herbarium specimens housed at PRE. Morphological features were studied and measurements of characters recorded.Results: Neorautanenia mitis is extremely variable morphologically, so that several authors recognised many different variants, some of these as distinct species, including N. brachypus. Examination of numerous specimens, however, indicates that these are merely morphological and/or geographical variants of N. mitis. This observation prompted Verdcourt to place this taxon as a synonym of N. mitis; however, he reversed that decision 30 years later. It has become necessary to revert to the original decision.Conclusions: Neorautanenia brachypus is formally reduced to a synonymy of N. mitis and as a result the genus comprises only two species.",

    "abstract": "Background: The species-rich flora of southern Africa comprises a high number of endemics, including succulents such as the flowering stones in the genus Lithops, but conservation status for these species is not well underpinned because detailed field data and assessments of genetic diversity are lacking.Objectives: We wanted to assess plant abundance and identify factors that may affect survival in Lithops ruschiorum through carefully conducted field surveys, and to determine amount and partitioning of genetic variation by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis.Method: Field surveys were carried out in nine populations in Namibia. The most meticulously studied population was divided into 51 sites, while another 43 sites were recognised in the remaining eight populations. At each site, occupied area and number of plants were recorded as well as altitude, aspect, slope, soil texture and substrate. Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers were employed to study 52 individuals from seven populations.Results: In total, 8465 individuals were recorded. Plant density and/or plant number was associated with aspect, slope, soil texture, substrate and geographic distance from the coast. Analysis of molecular variation showed that 95% of the variability occurs within populations. Genetic and geographic distances among populations were correlated suggesting an isolation-by-distance pattern.Conclusion: Results are concordant with a strong impact of fog-based precipitation on plant density in the coastal populations, whereas rain probably is more important at one population which is situated further inland. Within-population genetic variation was medium high as usually reported for perennial, outcrossing species, but the low population differentiation implies considerable gene flow and/or population fragmentation.",

This was accompanied by a monitoring of the physicochemical parameters in the water of the wetland with a multiparameter probe. The activity of the biomarkers was determined in the S12 fraction (post-mitochondrial fraction) of tissues of Pachychilus sp. by means of UV-Visible spectrophotometry methods in a microplate reader. We found a lower activity of AChE (39.0%), higher ratio of conjugation of GST (28.5%) followed by a lower presence (25.0%) of lipid peroxidation (MDA) in the dry season in the tissue of the snails. In addition, significant associations were found between the ratio of conjugation of the GST with the rest of the biomarkers in both seasons, which is the result of detoxification processes in the snails. The activity of the biomarkers could be modulated by salinity, thus regulating the production of antioxidant enzymes and the toxicity of the pesticides used in agricultural areas near this wetland. The snails of the genus Pachychilus sp. they can be used as bioindicators of the health status of wetlands, which can lead to the design of management measures for the conservation and sustainable management of these ecosystems.",

Feeding groups combine phylogeneticand dietary information about termites into ecologically significant functional categories.Objectives: To characterise termite feeding group prevalence, distribution and diversity in southern Africa and assess the effect of precipitation on termite diversity and assemblage composition.Method: Termite genus and species-level occurrence data were acquired from the South African Termite Database and classified into one of five feeding groups. We evaluated the prevalence of each feeding group and assessed species and feeding group richness and dominance. Linear regressions were performed to determine the relationship between 1) species richness and precipitation; and 2) feeding group richness and precipitation.Results: We find that southern Africa 1) is dominated by FG-IIw (feeding group – II, wood feeding) termites; 2) is occupied by multiple feeding groups across the entirety of the rainfall gradient; and that precipitation 3) influences feeding group species diversity variably; and 4) causes notable shifts in termite community structure.Conclusion: Our results indicate that termites likely make substantial contributionsto plant material decomposition across southern Africa and that while shifts in feeding group dominance are associated with rainfall gradients, the services unique to individual feeding groups are not isolated to certain regions, but ratherare widespread regardless of the amount of precipitation received.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Deforested and degraded areas can be cheaply and conveniently restored through establishment of exclosures. An area exclosure excludes animals and humans from accessing an area to promote natural regeneration of plants and rehabilitate ecological condition of the area. The study was aimed at: (1) determining the diversity (species richness, diversity and evenness); (2) assessing the stand structure (densities); and (3) assessing regeneration status of woody species inside and outside exclosed Maun International Airport, northern Botswana. Methods: Vegetation sampling was conducted from April to May 2018. A total of 48 and 37 quadrats of 20 × 20 m were laid down at 50 m intervals along transect lines inside and outside Maun International Airport, respectively. Identity, number of all live individuals and height of all woody species were recorded in all the quadrats. The diversity of all woody species was analysed by using the Shannon Diversity Index (H’) and regeneration status of each woody species was assessed using frequency distribution of height class. Results: The diversity, evenness and species richness were significantly higher inside than outside Maun International Airport. Colophospermum mopane was the most abundant species both inside (75% of all woody species) and outside (96% of all woody species) Maun International Airport. More species showed more regeneration inside than outside Maun International Airport. The inside of Maun International Airport recorded more alien invasive woody species compared with the outside, owing to its original use as a residential area. The local communities might have introduced these species as ornamental trees. Conclusion: This study, while limited in scale, contributes to understanding of the role of exclosures in enhancing woody species richness, diversity and evenness as well as facilitating regeneration of woody species. Degraded woodlands and other similar ecosystems could be cheaply and conveniently restored through establishment of exclosures, but more research and monitoring are required to fully understand the processes and impacts.",

This is perhaps especially true in Africa where 60 accepted species are recorded, many seemingly endemic to the eastern and central tropical areas. Further taxonomic work will enable better understanding of the genus, its biogeography and regional patterns of plant diversity; help guide conservation efforts; and facilitate a broader understanding of the evolution of the Afrotropical flora.Objectives: The objective of this study is to describe a new species of Sematophyllum from Rwanda, part of the mega-diverse Albertine Rift system.Methods: Light microscopy was used to compare anatomical and morphological details of the putative new species with specimens of other members of the genus with which it could potentially be conspecific.Results: Sematophyllum rheophyticum W.R. Buck Hedd. was described as new and is currently known only from the type locality at Gisakura, Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda. It is distinguishable from all congeners by a unique combination of characters including the concave, abruptly acuminate leaves, the alar areolation and the rheophytic habitat.Conclusion: Sematophyllum rdicum is a new species, defined by a combination of several anatomical characters, known currently only from the type locality. Furthermore, it is one of only a few species in the genus that occurs in rheophytic habitats. Its phylogenetic relationships are obscure and will probably need to be evaluated with molecular evidence.",

A checklist is important to provide basic information on the extent of the diversity, and to provide the most recent name and classification.Objective: To present a list of all the lichenised, lichenicolous and allied fungi reported from South Africa.Methods: The list presented is entirely literature based and no attempt has been made to check the report of any taxa or their status by checking the specimens upon which they are based. Firstly, all taxa that were not reported from within the modern boundaries of South Africa were excluded. Next, the Recent literature on lichens database was searched for literature on South African lichens since 1945 and all references checked for new species or new reports, which were then added to the list. These names were then checked against Index Fungorum to ensure that the most current name was being used. Finally, the list was rationalised by excluding all synonyms and dubious infraspecific taxa.Results: The current list includes 1750 taxa in 260 genera from mainland South Africa, with an additional 100 species and 23 genera from the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, which are treated separately. The replacement name Verrucaria dagolavii Fryday is proposed for Verrucaria umbilicata Øvstedal.Conclusion: It is estimated that, when fully explored, the lichen biota of South Africa will consist of somewhere between 2500 and 3000 taxa.",

    "abstract": "For millennia farmers have been improving crops by using their natural genetic variation, selecting the best varieties. Today we face an unprecedented challenge to feed the growing global human population that can only be achieved with major changes in how we combine science and technology with agronomy. Cassava is globally important, annually feeding almost a billion people in 105 countries. It is an important crop for subsistence farming throughout tropical and subtropical regions for smallholder farmers, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Cassava is highly dependant on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to survive. Mycorrhizal fungi form symbioses with all our major crops. They help plants obtain phosphate from the soil; an essential nutrient that limits cassava production in the tropics. Our Colombian-swiss group have shown a significant effect of Rhizophagus irregularis inoculation on yield of cassava in field conditions in two locations in Colombia. Further, huge differences in the productivity of cassava can be achieved by inoculating it with genetically different lines of R. irregularis. The variation in cassava growth we observed is so large that it would be very unlikely in one generation of plant breeding to see similar variation in cassava growth. By combining agronomy with biology and genetics, we propose a shift in the paradigm of plant breeding that could help to solve the problem of hunger in the world.",

    "abstract": "Background: South African brambles (Rubus L., Rosaceae) represent a complex group of six native species and at least 12 introduced taxa with different ploidy levels and varying tendencies to hybridisation. The role of hybridisation, introgression and apomixis in the ongoing evolution has been hypothesised based on morphological observations, but it has not been rigorously studied to date, and nor has the phylogeny of the group. Objectives and methods: This paper aims to reveal the evolutionary patterns and mechanisms in South African brambles by employing three types of molecular markers: plastid and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, and nuclear microsatellites. Results: The data confirmed the tetraploid R. thaumasius A.Beek and diploid R. ludwigii Eckl. &amp; Zeyh. as distinct native species, while the other four native species are shown to be closely related and likely derived from three ancestors. Conclusion: Ancient hybridisation and limited gene flow between regions (particularly between winter- and summer-rainfall zones) appear to be the main drivers of current patterns in the tetraploid R. pinnatus Willd. and hexaploid R. rigidus Sm. Current hybridisation is also likely, although rare. The mechanism of ‘octoploid bridge’ is proposed, which overcomes the ploidy reproduction barrier between R. pinnatus (or other tetraploids) and R. rigidus. No gene flow was detected between native and alien taxa, but clonal duplications were discovered in the R. bergii × pinnatus hybrid, which implies the possibility of apomictic spread of homoploid hybrids formed between native and introduced brambles and the potential for a new invasion. On the other hand, heteroploid hybrids (R. bergii × rigidus) are formed recurrently and spread only vegetatively.",

The rivers along the eastern shore of the Bay are relatively undisturbed. Those along the western shore are more disturbed but still contain some noteworthy environments. The most detrimental changes have occurred around the rivers of the Cape Flats, along the northern shore.",

The flora of the reserve was sampled over a period o f three years and plants were collected in all the vegetation types of grassland, thicket and forest. 488 species were collected with a species to family ratio of 4:4. The majority of the taxa recorded represent the major phytochoria of the region. Nineteen species are endemic to the Eastern Cape, two are classed as vulnerable, five are rare, six are protected and a further seventeen are of uncertain status. The flora of the Kap River has closest affinities to that of the Alexandria Forest.",

    "abstract": "Iridaceae, a family of worldwide distribution, comprises some 1 500 species and 85 genera. It exhibits its greatest radiation in Sub-Saharan Africa, where over half the species and some 48 genera occur. 45 of which are endemic. All three major subfamilial taxa are represented in Africa, where Ixioideae are almost entirely restricted, with extensions into Eurasia. Areas of greatest concentration are either montane or in areas of winter rainfall. In southern Africa alone, there are some 850 species in 46 genera, making the family the fifth largest in the flora. In the Cape Floristic Region there are 620 species, and the family is the fourth largest in this area. All major infrafamilial groups occur in the Cape Region where most of the variability as well as generic radiation is encountered. The idea of a southern origin for Iridaceae in Africa is analysed systematically, and is correlated with the major climatic changes that occurred in Africa since the mid-Tertiary, and culminated in the seasonally dry climates along the west coast. The establishment of mediterranean climate in the southwest provided the stimulus for massive speciation and radiation of the family there. Plio-Pleistocene uplift along the eastern half of the African continent led to the establishment of substantial upland areas and allowed the spread of some genera, such as Romulea, Gladiolus, Moraea, and Hesperantha into tropical Africa. Short-distance dispersal probably accounts for the presence of genera such as Gladiolus, Gynandriris and Romulea in Eurasia.",

However, some species that on other characters, would be placed together, had widely differing seed testas. Gross surface morphology varied from smooth to colliculate, irregularly rugose, reticulate with the ridges variously arranged, wheel-shaped (radiate or ammonite-like), with a central ridge or with multicellular barbed scales. The seeds were without hairs, unlike some American species sometimes considered to belong in Justicia (Graham 1989). Micromorphology also provided useful characters, with seeds being reticulate, papillate, minutely or deeply rugose or with one to many crystals visible. Critical-point drying was sometimes helpful in viewing microstructure.",

    "abstract": "African sedimentary rocks and their contained fossils have played a fundamental role in the unravelling of Precambrian biological history. Various lines of evidence including stromatolites, filamentous and coccoidal microfossils, stable isotope ratios, organic carbon distribution, and oxide facies iron formation suggest that a complex prokaryotic ecosystem fueled by photosynthesis, and perhaps including aerobic photoautotrophs, existed as early as 3 500 m.y. ago. The primary sources of data on early Archean life are rock sequences in southern Africa and Australia. The diversity of later Archean (ca. 2 700 m.y.) communities is attested to by abundant and varied stromatolites found in Zimbabwe. The extensive growth and consolidation of continents that heralded the Proterozoic Eon had profound effects on the earth’s biota. Primary productivity must have increased substantially, resulting in the establishment of an 02-rich atmosphere, and, subsequently, the radiation of aerobic respirers. Southern African sequences provide critical evidence bearing on this crust/atmosphere/biota interaction; however, the best known microfossils of this age come from North America. Upper Proterozoic sedimentary rocks abound in Africa. Stromatolites from northwestern Africa have been well studied; however, microfossil occurrences remain but sketchily described. Contemporaneous sequences from Scandinavia and Australia document the initial radiation of eukaryotes in the planktonic realm, as well as a terminal Precambrian episode of extinction among plankters. Early heterotrophic protists are known from several continents. The Nama Group of South West Africa/Namibia contains important evidence of early invertebrates. In general, Precambrian evolution can be viewed as a series of increasingly elevated biological plateaus connected by steps marking relatively short periods of evolutionary innovation and radiation. With each step, communities have increased in complexity, but prokaryote mediated element cycles established early in biological history remain at the core of functioning ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The inflorescence construction of eight species, representative of the types found in the 119 species of the rosaceous genus Cliffortia L. is described, based on stereo microscopic examination of fresh and dried specimens, combined with extensive field observations. In its simplest form the inflorescence is a reduced short shoot, bearing a lateral ebracteate flower and a potentially viable apical bud. Variations in the basic structure can be in the number of flowers, the mix of the sexes of the flowers and the number and type of short shoots as primary, secondary and tertiary axes. A high incidence of structural plasticity of the inflorescence occurs. This can be either throughout the development of the inflorescence or only at the onset of the vegetative stage. These changes occur in the short shoot(s) constituting the axes of the inflorescence, causing either an increase in the length of the intemodes. apical proliferation of the axes or a combination of these two effects. A specific com­bination of changes is linked to a specific inflorescence type. The vegetative elements of the inflorescence thus modified, are retained as an integral part of the vegetative branching system, with extensive influence on the branching pattern. This can also result in the predominance of one sex over the other over time, so that an individual, initially of the one sex. can become one of the opposite sex by the end of the season. Erroneous interpretation of a single point in the process of sex change as if it is a permanent state of sexuality, led to the prev alent acceptance of dioecy as the norm for the genus. Monoecy with dichogamy (or herkogamy at inflorescence level) was observed in this genus, as in many other wind-pollinated taxa.",

As the method was found inadequate for obtaining optimal definition and arrangement of plant communities, it was supplemented by the Braun-Blanquet Table Method, which served as a substitute for inverse and nodal analyses. This led to a better understanding of the vegetation of the Reserve. Because association-analysis is strictly hierarchical, presentation of inter-group relationships and interpretation of vegetation-habitat relationships are limited. It is argued that the monothetic character of normal and inverse association-analyses is a further limitation and although this is com­pensated for by nodal-analysis, valuable information is discarded as peripheral in the latter process.",

Ixia undulata Burm.f. (1768) is an earlier name for T. crispa (L.f.) Ker Gawl. based on Gladiolus crispus L.f. (1782) and the combination T. undulata (Burm.f.) Baker must be used for the species, which is native to the western half of Western Cape, South Africa. The variety T. crispa var. parx iflora is also reduced to synonymy. The type specimen of Ixia gladiolaris Lam. (1789), currently considered a synonym of Tritonia securigera (Aiton) Ker Gawl.. has flowers that lack the characteristic tooth-like ridges on the lower tepals of the latter, and corresponds closely to the eastern southern African T. lineata (Salisb.) Ker Gawl., based on Gladiolus lineatus Salisb. (1796). The new combination T. gladiolaris (Lam.) Goldblatt J.C. Manning is made and T. lineata is reduced to synonymy. Montbretia lacerata and Tritonia lacerata. erroneously regarded as synonyms of T. crispa, are combinations based on Gladiolus laceratus Burm.f., a species that remains unidenti­fied because no type is known and the description is too vague to permit its identification. Lastly, field studies have shown that the cnsped-leaved T. watermeveri is connected by a series of morphological intermediates to typical T. securigera. which has straight leaves and identical flowers. The new combination T. securigera subsp. watermeveri (L.Bolus) J.C.Manning Goldblatt is proposed for this taxon.",

    "abstract": "The genus Micranthus (Pers.) Eckl., has traditionally been treated as comprising three species, all with virtually identical, bilaterally symmetric, deep or pale blue to white flowers arranged in crowded, 2-ranked spikes and with divided style branches, but differing in their foliage. Examination of plants in the field and herbarium shows that there are four additional species. M. filifolius Goldblatt J.C.Manning, from the Caledon District of the southwestern Western Cape, has up to six, filiform leaves, the blades of at least the lowermost terete and cross-shaped in section, and usually pale blue-mauve flowers. M. simplex Goldblatt J.C.Manning from high elevations on Zebrakop, Piketberg, has the smallest flowers in the genus, white but tinged lilac as they age, linear leaves up to 1.5 mm wide, and undivided style branches. M. cruciatus Goldblatt J.C.Manning, from the northern Cedarberg and Bokkeveld Mtns, has up to four leaves, the lower with linear or terete blades with heavily thickened margins and central vein and relatively large flowers, unusual in having the style dividing at the mouth of the perianth tube into particularly long branches, these deeply divided as is typical of the genus. M. thereianthoides Goldblatt J.C.Manning, from the Paardeberg south of Malmesbury, is unique in the genus in having flowers with an elongate perianth tube. We also document the occurrence of large populations of putative hybrids at some sites. We provide a complete revision of Micranthus with original observations on leaf anatomy, pollen morphology and reproductive biology and discuss its confused taxonomic and nomenclatural history and that of the three common species of the genus, known for over 150 years. In so doing, we neotypify Gladiolus alopecuroides L. (1756) [= Micranthus alopecuroides (L.) Eckl. (1827)], type of the genus, and choose lectotypes for M. plantagineus Eckl. var. junceus Baker (1892) and Gladiolus fistulosus Jacq. Now with seven species, Micranthus remains endemic to the Cape flora region, extending from its extreme northern limit in the Bokkeveld Mtns south-eastwards to Port Elizabeth. We also deal with the genera Paulomagnusia Kuntze and Beilia Kuntze with which Micranthus has sometimes been associated, although both are nomenclatural synonyms of Thereianthus G.J.Lewis, a genus close allied to Micranthus.",

The exsiccatae span three centuries, with the earliest specimens issued in 1845 and the latest in 2009. This indicates the long-standing exchange of material and transfer of knowledge between herbaria in South Africa and countries of the northern Hemisphere. Many of the exsiccatae in PRE are incomplete and specimens were received as duplicates in exchange sets rather than exsiccatae. PRE houses a number of important African and southern hemisphere exsiccatae including two different sets of A. Rehmann’s Musci Austro-Africani (1875–1877) and Musci Austro-Africani cont., and R. Ochyra’s Bryophyta Antarctica exsiccata.",

These combined attributes characterize this species group, and the stomatal flanges are unique to this group in the genus Ehrharta Thunb. Microhairs are absent in E. villosa but are present in E. thunbergii which also possesses abaxial prickles and plentiful, rounded silica bodies not associated with cork cells as in E. villosa. These two taxa can. therefore, be separated anatomically. Nevertheless, they share many features and are undoubtedly closely related and their classification in the same species group is substantiated by the anatomical evidence presented in this paper.",

The floristic composition of the vegetation on soils of the Sterkspruit and Estcourt forms are often similar, although the soil form and other habitat conditions differ markedly.

The majority of dioecious species has fixed sex-associated translocation complexes with the male being the heterozygous sex. The sex-associated multivalent is usually O4 (ring-of-four) or O6 , rarely O8 . Dioecious species without sex-associated translocations are much less common. Most of the dioecious species are also polymorphic for floating translocations, producing one or more additional multivalents ranging from O4 to O12. Floating translocations may be more frequent in species that do not have sex-associated translocations. Supernumerary chromosomes are also present in several species. Sex ratios are at unity in most dioecious species, but female-biased ratios may occur in some species. The high correlation between dioecy and translocation heterozygosity suggests that translocations are primarily associated with the origin and establishment of dioecy. Any róle in the maintenance of biased sex ratios through meiotic drive is probably secondary. Sex-associated translocations may serve to stabilize dioecy by bringing the sex factors into close linkage. Subsequent structural rearrangements within a sex-associated translocation complex may bring the sex factors together in one chromosome pair, releasing floating translocations. The high frequencies of floating translocation heterozygosity in some species indicate that such heterozygosity also has adaptive value.",

The two species are also geographically separated: S. speciosissimus occurs in the Hottentots Holland and Franschhoek Mountains of the southwestern Cape, whereas S. coleophyllus is endemic to the Riviersonderend Mountains. Chrysocoma hantamensis sp. nov. is a distinctive new species endemic to the Bokkeveld and Roggeveld Plateaus. It is distinguished by its resprouting habit. 3-5-fid leaves and large capitula, 12-15 mm in diameter, with lanceolate. 3-veined involucral bracts, the largest 9 - 1 0 x 2 mm. Investigation of the variation in leaf morphology of the two radiate species of Oncosiphon, O. africanum (PJ.Bergius) Kallersjo and O. glabratum (Thunb.)

This light microscopic study is the first report on ovule and seed structure in the genus and the tribe. Ovules vary from four to six per ovary, are anatropous. crassinucellate. bitegmic and occur in an epitropous (rarely pleurotropous). median-parietal position in the unilocular, usually bicarpellate ovary. A very extensive nucellus cap. comprising nucellus epidermal derivatives and parietal tissue, characterizes the young ovule during mega- sporogenesis and megagametogenesis, but the chalazal nucellus is poorly developed. During meiosis. the micropvlar dyad cell degenerates early. The functional dyad cell forms two megaspores of which the chalazal one usually develops into a Polygonum-type embryo sac. At maturity, the micropylar end of the embryo sac is covered by the remnants of the nucellus epidermis, the parietal tissue having degenerated. The globular embryo has a short suspensor and lies in nuclear endosperm becoming cellular. The seed coat develops from both integuments, is tannimferous. has a glabrous surface with stomata and a single layer of exotegmic, longitudinal fibres.Results are compared with relevant information previously reported for genera in the tribes Flacourtieae. Samvdeae. Saliceae, Scyphostegiae and for Oncoha Forssk. (Salicaceae sensu lato). Embryologically Scolopia shows a number of ple- siomorphic features compared to other Salicaceae. For example, it lacks an extranucellar embryo sac. an apomorphic fea­ture in many Salicaceae. A summary of ovule and seed characters in Salicaceae sensu lato is given and contrasted with data available for Achariaceae sensu lato. Embryological data broadly supports the reclassification of genera, traditionally referred to Flacourtiaceae. amongst Salicaceae sensu lato and Achariaceae sensu lato.",

It differs from the similar looking N. lucida Benth. by having larger flowers with a more prominent spur (mostly 3.5—4.5 mm long vs 1.5 mm) and a pubescent palate. N. fourcadei is known from only two locations in the southern Cape. N. elata is a facultative perennial with white flowers, a lavender to purple reverse, and a white or very pale yellow palate. It is known only from the Langeberg and Oute-niqua Mountains between Swellendam and Montagu Pass. It is closest to N. fourcadei. but differs from that species by its more robust habit, the absence of a boss inside the corolla tube at the base of the hypochile, and a spur that is violet to purple at the base.",

It attempts, therefore, to re-create and to explain the dynamics of the evolution of plants through the analysis of all their characters and of the relationships existing between them. Consequently, it can only benefit from the birth or development of all disciplines that analyse fresh aspects of plants or study them in time and space. For these reasons, palynology has developed considerably within taxonomy, revealing new morphological characters that permit a comparison with many fossil examples. In the family Annonaceae, of which the different classifications are admittedly artificial, pollen studies have shown that evolution is expressed in continuous morphological series along parallel lines. The established correlations with other morphological characters throw some light on certain phenomena of parallel evolution within the family, showing that the flower of the Annonaceae is in the process of reduction and the correlations contribute to a better knowledge of the affinities between generic taxa and their respective evolutionary levels.",

However, such decreases corresponded more directly to a soil volumetric decrease than to a decrease in soil surface area per se. The relationship was also found to depend strongly on subsurface rock weathering patterns which may reverse the indicated relationship between standing crop and surface rock cover. The application of surface rock cover data without regard to profile stoniness, is, therefore, likely to be of limited use for comparing plant production across different geological substrates. The role of different rock types in giving rise to soils of different fertility with corresponding plant responses, was also indicated by the data. Sensitivity of plant standing crop to surface rock cover was possibly dependent on mean annual rainfall, but further data are required. The interpretation of aboveground standing crop data in terms of aboveground annual production is briefly discussed.",

The art of curing disease is practisea in a very empirical way by healers all over the Ivory Coast. In intertropical Africa, generally speaking, traditional medicine accounts for about 80-90c/t of the medicinal needs of the population. It has the advantage of being near at hand and provides medical treatment at low cost. The study of medicinal plants will result in the production locally of medicines from indigenous raw materials, and the project, in addition to the exploitation of national resources, will create work opportunities. Concerning ethnobotany, investigations carried out among healers in some areas of the Ivory Coast, have enabled the registration of several medicinal recipes that have resulted in various reports and publications. Yet, slow progress with the registration of plants of use in human health restricts the possibilities of phytotherapy. Clearly, many plants remain to be studied and evaluated. Unfortunately, thoughtless and rapid destruction of natural areas in several parts of the country, makes the discovery and judicious exploitation of our plant resources increasingly difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to urge African governments to take draconian actions in order to save our endangered medical heritage.",

The incidence of weediness and of threatened species is used as an indication of success or failure of families under prevailing conditions of disturbance. The resulting power shifts between indigenous families and the impact of exotic weeds on the situation are reviewed. Many power shifts are taking place between indigenous species in the veld. Superficially it seems as though a relatively few invasive species are displacing a larger number of threatened species, but evidence from Natal points to more species increasing than decreasing under conditions of over-utilization. Amongst small families power shifts are almost as prevalent and important as at species level. Seventeen small families have over 20% indigenous weed species. Thirty small families have over 20% threatened species, and 21 small families have had their species numbers bolstered by more than 20% by exotic weeds. A very few large and medium-sized families contain over 50% of our weeds and our threatened species. It is mostly temperate (Cape) families that are under pressure relative to more tropical families. This trend is echoed at sub-family level within the Fabaceae.",

A further 179 did not yield Basidiomycete mycelia when cultured. Paxillus panuoides and Stereum hirsutum were the most common species. Species of lower Hymenomycetes were more frequently isolated than polypores. The named species of fungi and unnamed mycelia are listed together with their hosts. Sevenspecies, viz.

From an examination of all available herbarium specimens the characteristics of A. giraffae, A. haematoxylon, and the hybrid are tabulated. Some of the characters displayed by the hybrid, for example number of pinna pairs, are found to be intermediate between the values recorded for the parent species, while other characters, for example the degree of pubescence and the presence of glands, tend to be inherited from one parent species only. It appears, therefore, that there is a marked tendency for certain characters associated together in a parent to be associated in the hybrid.",

In this paper we celebrate this milestone by giving an overview of the history of the Department at this campus, including its recent establishment and expansion on the NWU Mahikeng Campus (formerly the University of North-West). A brief overview is presented of the advances in teaching and research over the years, and the development and relevance of the important plant collections in the botanical garden, two herbaria and the national diatom collection. The main emphasis of this contribution is, however, a reflection on the advancement and significance of research conducted by various disciplines on plant and algae function, diversity and ecological restoration over the years. The different disciplines in Botany at NWU, from the oldest to the more recent, are Plant Taxonomy, Plant Ecophysiology, Terrestrial Plant Ecology, Aquatic Sciences, Urban and Settlement Ecology, Geoecology, and Proteomics. Different aspects contributing to changes occurring in the environment, such as pollution, land degradation, urbanisation, overexploitation of resources and the subsequent effect of these on plant diversity and function are especially addressed in our current research. The results of our research inter alia led to solutions for problems occurring in the landscape and contribute to the well-being of the people using the land and water by restoring important ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Background: The role of protected areas as sanctuaries for indigenous vegetation in Malawi, particularly miombo woodlands, will become increasingly important in the face of global change and rising human populations. Accurate knowledge of the extent and composition of woody components of plant communities will therefore play a vital part in informing conservation and management initiatives.Objectives: The aims of this study were to (1) classify, describe and map thewoody plant communities of the Majete Wildlife Reserve (MWR) using a combination of remote sensing and on-the-ground surveys, and (2) to compile an inventory of the tree and shrub species present in MWR.Methods: A combination of remote sensing and on-the-ground surveys was used to classify, describe and map the woody plant communities of MWR. Additionally, an inventory of the tree and shrub species in each delineated woody plant community was made.Results: Five distinct woody plant communities, two of which were subdivided into three sub-communities each, were recognised in MWR, and a total of 118 woody plant species within 31 families were identified. A description of the location, structure and species composition of each community is provided. Miombo was the most widespread community (covering 35.9% of the area), while the lower-altitude shrublands and woodlands were the richest floristically.Conclusion: This information is intended to provide a basis for improved management planning and policy development, including fire management, the placement of infrastructure, and the re-introduction of extirpated mammal species, as well as providing a baseline against which to monitor change. Additionally, this study provided an example of how the combination of remote sensing and ground surveys can provide a rapid and relatively inexpensive method for classifying the woody components of communities at a relatively fine scale over large areas, which may become particularly relevant for developing countries and regions that undergo rapid and constant change.",

Ixia capillaris and I. pauciflora have until now been the only species with such leaves and they have not been regarded as immediately related in past accounts of the genus. The two foliage leaves, typically less than 2 mm w ide, with a leathery to succulent texture, and lacking a raised central vein or margins, are specialized in the genus. Associated finely fibrous corm tunics, spikes of 1-3 flowers, and when present, short, thread-like lateral branches, usually bearing 1 or 2 flowers, provide supporting evidence that the group is monophyletic. I. capillaris as interpreted until now. comprises four species, three of them new and described here, and the large-flowered I. pauciflora includes two species, one of these described here. While I. capillaris has a branched stem, radially symmetric flowers with a penanth tube (4—)5—7(—8) mm long, tepals 11-15 mm long and thus substantially exceeding the tube, filaments typically exserted 1-2 mm. and anthers (3—)4—5 mm long. I. exiliflora has a tube 8-10 mm long and ± as long as the tepals, included filaments, and anthers 3.5—4.0 mm long. The new I. dieramoides also has included filaments but a perianth tube 13—18(—22) mm long and tepals 11-18 mm long. A third new species. I. reclinata has large flowers with a tube 13-15 mm long, tepals 16-21 mm long, and unilateral, decimate stamens with the filaments exserted 8-10 mm. and anthers 4-5 mm long. Typical I. pauciflora has flowers with unilateral stamens and filaments exserted 2-6 mm from the flower and anthers prominently displayed, but specimens until now included in that species w ith short, included filaments 3-5 mm long and anthers half included in the tube, are here regarded as I. dieramoides.

    "abstract": "The description of Riccia hirsuta (Volk Perold 1986) is emended and new illustrations of the species are provided, as the original description and illustrations were based on two distinct, but rather similar species. Examination of newly collected material of R. hirsuta, showed it to belong to subgenus Riccia, section Pilifer (Volk 1983). Section Micantes (Volk Perold 1986) of which this was the type species, is therefore transferred to section Pilifer. R. tomentosa Volk Perold, sp. nov., described here, is at first glance somewhat similar to R. hirsuta in its habit, hence the earlier confusion in Volk Perold (1986). It also resembles R. hirsuta in its dorsal covering of long hairs and in the triangular scales apically split into cellular strands. R. tomentosa, however, differs from R. hirsuta in the spongy (not compact) construction of the thallus and in the spores permanently united in tetrads (not single). It belongs to subgenus Thallocarpus and is the type species of the new section Pannosae.",

Solms was used to identify the limiting nutrient in the Vernon Hooper Dam and to predict population sizes, yields, growth rates and frequencies and amounts of harvest under varying conditions of nutrient loading and climate. Predicted data were used to evaluate the effectiveness of harvesting measures currently being employed for controlling both nutrient inputs and the population size in this impoundment. Predictions o f the population size, before harvesting was initiated, generally compared favourably with th a t estimated visually. Predictions of the quantities of P that could be removed daily by a 20 ha population indicate that such a population in the impoundment could reduce P concentrations in the epilimnion during summer stratification to levels limiting for algae. This may explain the observed reduction in algal concentrations since the introduction of harvesting. Estimates of the amounts and frequencies of harvest required to contain the predicted potential yields of a 20 ha population indicate that 100 metric tonnes of fresh water hyacinths harvested daily from the impoundment, under present conditions of reduced nutrient loading, are adequate during winter, but not during summer.",

All these taxa share a very characteristic leaf anatomy with inrolled or infolded leaves without keels and have adaxial ribs with interlocking prickles. The chlorenchyma is dense and compact with inwardly projecting invaginations visible in all taxa except E. setacea subsp. setacea. In E . setacea subsp. scabra typical arm cells are present. Abaxial costal and intercostal zones are not differentiated and stomata are absent. The long cells are hexagonal or inflated with sinuous walls. Silica bodies are single or paired and rounded in shape. Small hook-like prickles with short barbs are common. Microhairs with a short, truncated distal cell occur. This leaf anatomical structure differs considerably from that of the other species groups recognized in African Ehrharta and the Setacea group appears to be more distinct from the other groups than they are from each other.",

Some morphological traits overlap between some species, thus causing taxonomic confusion.Objectives: The discriminatory power of the core DNA barcodes (matK and rbcLa) was evaluated, and the current taxonomy of Clivia was assessed.Method: Seventy-four two-locus DNA barcodes from 4 to 18 specimens per species were generated.Results: The matK region had a higher mean intraspecific variation of 0.21 compared with the 0.02 of rbcLa. The two-locus barcodes have an aligned length of 1335 base pairs. Three species, Clivia mirabilis, Clivia nobilis and Clivia caulescens, are monophyletic in the Bayesian Inference (BI) cladogram. The remaining Clivia species (Clivia miniata, Clivia gardenii, Clivia robusta and their affinities) are paraphyletic. Clivia is divided into 17 haplogroups with those of C. mirabilis and C. nobilis being unique. Clivia caulescens has three haplotypes. The Clivia species from the north-eastern distribution range of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces have 11 haplogroups and no species-specific DNA barcodes. These groups have no correlation with the current taxonomy or geographical distribution.Conclusions: Only 37.33% of the species can be correctly identified with the ‘best match’ option in SpeciesIdentifier. Clivia mirabilis, C. nobilis and C. caulescens have unique DNA barcodes to identify them. Specimens from the Ngome area in KwaZulu-Natal have a unique DNA barcode, separating them from the rest of C. gardenii. A taxonomic revision is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Background: ‘Mainstreaming biodiversity’ aims to integrate biodiversity priorities directly into the policies and practices of production sectors, including the mining sector. In South Africa, the need emerged for a biodiversity guideline specifically relevant to the mining sector that would interpret a wide range of available spatial biodiversity information and frame it in a user-friendly format.Objectives: The aim of this article was to document and review the development of the Mining and Biodiversity Guideline. This serves as a case study of a product developed to assist in bridging the gap between available biodiversity information and use of this information by a production sector.Methods: We examined the development of the Mining and Biodiversity Guideline with reference to three factors known to be beneficial to creating policy-relevant science: a sound scientific foundation (credibility), relevance to decision-making (salience) and involvement of stakeholders (legitimacy).Results: The Mining and Biodiversity Guideline was developed through collaboration between the mining and biodiversity sectors. It provides a tool that contributes to the sustainable development of South Africa’s mineral resources in a way that enables regulators, industry and practitioners to minimise the impact of mining on biodiversity and ecosystem services. It includes a single integrated map of biodiversity priority areas summarised into four sensitivity categories relevant for the mining industry, with detailed guidance on how these should inform the application of the mitigation hierarchy.Conclusion: The Mining and Biodiversity Guideline has received political endorsement from the relevant regulatory government departments. A focussed training programme has promoted awareness and understanding of the Guideline. Preliminary reports indicate that the Guideline has been effective in influencing decision-making.",

The species is sometimes considered to have been introduced to South Africa due to its disjunct distribution. It has remained poorly studied and little is known about the local populations of this palm.Objectives: This study provides a descriptive treatment and documents the population structure of B. aethiopum in this area, and presents a key to the six indigenous palm species of South Africa.Methods: All accessible populations were surveyed and documented, and eight transects were randomly placed to gather data on size class distributions. B. aethiopum and other indigenous palm species were compared morphologically.Results: The population structure analyses of B. aethiopum revealed a monotonic decline, but the permutation index suggested that the species is prone to recruitment events. This is supported by patches that are dominated by specific height classes. Leaf shape and size, fruit size and geographical distribution were the diagnostic characters most useful to recognize the species of South African indigenous palms.Conclusion: Borassus aethiopum is distinguishable from other South African palms based on stem, leaf and fruit characters. It is considered as indigenous to Granite Lowveld as the palm is part of the natural vegetation and is characterized by a size class distribution reflecting a stable population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Naturalised populations of Asphodelus fistulosus (onion weed) were recorded in South Africa for the first time during the early 1990s. Initial records lodged in 2012 indicated the presence of two populations. Five additional populations were found between 2012 and 2016, as a result of surveys and the distribution of awareness materials. All populations in South Africa occurred along roadsides, but in other parts of the world the species has demonstrated the ability to spread into adjacent native vegetation and crop fields.Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of invasion and potential for eradication.Method: A risk assessment tool was used to establish invasion risk. Of the seven known populations, five test populations were selected to gather data on the feasibility for eradication. Randomised fixed plots were used to monitor the response of A. fistulosus populations to mechanical and chemical plant control methods and to track spread over time. The germinability of seeds was also tested.Results: The Standard Australian Risk Assessment method for invasive alien plants gave a relatively high score for the threat posed by this species. In this assessment, a threshold score is used to indicate sufficient invasive risk to fail a species as part of a preborder risk assessment. Invasiveness elsewhere (Australia and USA) contributed to the relatively high score. The bioclimatic modelling map highlighted the south-western region of South Africa as most suitable climatically for A. fistulosus. Both mechanical and chemical control methods were shown to be effective in killing live plants. Results, based on plant removal and monitoring, over a four-year research period suggest that suppression of reproduction is possible, partly as a result of high detectability and ease of control.Conclusion: It is recommended that A. fistulosus be listed as a National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004 1a invasive species (eradication target) under national legislation, thus requiring compulsory management. We estimate that extirpation of all known populations of A. fistulosusmay be possible with continual effort at an annual investment of approximately ZAR 50 000 per year. Further surveillance for undiscovered populations and monitoring of known populations must be conducted to produce a definitive comment about the feasibility of countrywide eradication.",

    "abstract": "Background: Morphological characteristics and life history strategies are vital in the success of plants to inhabit specific areas. Until recently the genus Acanthopsis was taxonomically poorly understood, and a recent revision rectified this aspect. The group comprises 20 species, all confined to arid parts of South Africa and Namibia. Much regarding the life history and ecology of the genus was still unknown. Objectives: Members of the genus Acanthopsis adapted to harsh environmental conditions have evolved an array of functional traits to enhance their chances of survival. The present contribution focuses on a select few of these traits, with discussion centred around them. Methods: This paper gives an overview of some casual and anecdotal observations made on the morphological characteristics and life history strategy during the taxonomic study. Results: Significant adaptations include a perennial subshrub habit, spinous inflorescences/infructescences, and flowers exhibiting the classical syndrome for insect pollination, likely by insects possessing elongated proboscises. Additionally, the seeds are myxospermous and undergo dispersal solely when there is an ample supply of water for germination. Noteworthy is the prompt germination of seeds, occurring within 24 h. Conclusion: Certain observations may potentially serve as catalysts for further, more in-depth investigations into the ecological significance of specific morphological traits and how the species might respond to anticipated future changes in temperature and precipitation.",

Obligate pollination mutualisms are ideal for investigating the underlying processes of niche evolution by environmental change. Objectives: Niche evolution that corresponds with phenotype-by-environment interactions that include climate shifts is expected to affect the stability of partner associations of mutualisms. Here, we compare the evolution of fig syconium size and growth form strategies for coping with soil water stress during a range expansion by Ficus into arid environments. Methods: Niche models of 31 Ficus taxa were used to define contemporary habitat requirements of each species, which are then incorporated into Bayesian mixed models to examine the response of each trait to the soil water variables, other environmental variables and phylogenetic dependencies. Results: The results showed that phylogenetic constraints best explained syconium size variation, while environmental lability best characterised growth form variation. Two species adapted to arid environments that exhibited convergence in these traits had significantly different habitat requirements compared to forest and savanna species. Conclusion: The niche expansions by Ficus ilicina and Ficus cordata involved distinct historical processes. The findings suggest selection for traits that varied at different temporal scales limit the rate of niche expansions, and potentially destabilise mutualist partnerships and promote host shifts.",

The altitudinal distribution of the orchids, the distribution of the terrestrial and epiphytic species and the extralimital distribution of the species is assessed for both genera and subfamilies (after the systematic concept of Dressier 1981). The altitudinal distribution of species endemic to Malawi is also assessed. The terrestrial species show a significant increase with altitude whereas the epiphytic species are more dominant al the lower levels. A similar increase is also found in the species endemic to Malawi. An analysis of the distributions shared with other African countries reveals that most species also occur in Zambia, Zimbabwe and East Africa, whereas significantly fewer species are shared with Angola, southern Africa, Mocambique, Zaire and West Africa. Most species shared with tropical African countries are found on the lower slopes of Mt Mulanje.",

Two of the three subgenera that are recognized, namely subgenus Marchantia (with two species, M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis and M. berteroana). as well as subgenus Chlamidium (Corda) Bischl. which is divided into three sections, namely Paleaceae (with M. paleacea subsp. paleacea). Chlamidium (with M. pappeana subsp. pappeana) and Papillatae (with M. debilis) are treated. The third subgenus. Protomarchantia Schust.. is absent from the region. Corrections need to be made to the Marchantia species given in Magill Schelpe's (1979) checklist and in Arnold De Wet (1993). Descriptions and illustrations of the taxa together with distribution maps, their ecology and a key to the subgenera and species are provided. Only traditional taxonomic methods were employed and this treatment closely follows that of Bischler-Causse ( 1993a). the recognized world authority on the group. All southern African specimens held at BOL and PRE. as well as a few from other herbaria have been studied and some new collections have been added. It is shown that M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis has been introduced, as it is only known from local nurseries. The presence here of M. paleacea subsp. paleacea is confirmed, although it is rare. Otherwise little that is new could be added to the exhaustive studies by Bischler-Causse (1993a).",

    "abstract": "Five papers cover different aspects of the contributions to and role of botany in the development of the Republic of South Africa. Two papers sum up the contributions for the non-agricultural and agricultural sectors. The introductory paper by D. J. B. Killick provides a short historical account of the Botanical Research Institute, followed by a discussion of the contributions of the Institute to botany in South Africa through its National Herbarium and identification service as well as researches in taxonomy, plant anatomy, cyto-genetics, ecology, economic botany and data processing. B. de Winter emphasizes the fundamental role of taxonomy and bio-systematics for planning and the optimal use of the natural plant resources. The current support for taxonomy and biosystematics is examined and proposals made for improving progress in the Flora of Southern Africa series. For plant physiology, N. Grobbelaar discusses, firstly, the ways whereby the productivity of a plant species with its characteristic genetic constitution can be raised by determining and modifying for optimal response the effects of environmental factors such as spacing, mineral nutrition, water provision, etc.; and, secondly, usually when the first means has been achieved, of improving plant productivity by altering the genetic constitution of the plant so that it can perform better than its ancestors under the prevailing conditions. After discussing and illustrating the applications and roles of plant ecology, D. Edwards concludes that basic plant ecological research is required, firstly, at the regional level through regional plant ecological studies to supply the essential local knowledge needed by researchers, planners and users of the land; and, secondly, at the more detailed level where knowledge is needed of the processes and factors that govern the behaviour of vegetation so that it can be properly used, managed and manipulated. M. J. Wells discusses the role of economic botanists for priority research assessment, and for research on problem plants, such as weeds, and on plants for food and other useful products, especially from the rich and untapped South African flora of over 17 000 species. The needs for an adequate base of primary botanical data are stressed, and for ethnobotanical work to assist exploration of plant uses. S. A. Hulme, in his summing up for the agricultural sector, points out that despite the emergence of the specialist agricultural disciplines, botanical research remains fundamental to the understanding of the plant. Following on the important contributions that botany has made to agriculture, there remain many important contributions to agriculture for the future through physiological and other botanical studies. In his summing up for the non-agricultural sector, D. M. Joubert illustrates the ways whereby the influence of the Botanical Research Institute and its co-operation with other institutes and organizations extends beyond the purely agricultural field to other national programmes involving terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, in plant alkaloid research, in nature conservation, etc.",

    "abstract": "Field work in southern Africa over the past several years has resulted in the discovery of three new species of the sub- Saharan African and Madagascan genus Aristea Aiton, which now comprises some 53 species. Aristea has a pronounced centre in southern Africa and a centre of diversity in the winter rainfall zone of the subcontinent, where all three new species occur, one extending eastward into the adjacent southern edge of the summer rainfall zone. All three novelties have been collected in the past but were confused with related species. A elliptica (subgenus Eucapsulares), confused in the past with A. pusilla (Thunb.) Ker Gawl., has a more robust habit, usually with 4 or 5 flower clusters per flowering stem, pale blue flowers, smooth ellipsoid seeds with flattened surface cells, and pollen shed as monads, whereas A. pusilla usually has 1-3 flower clusters per flowering stem, dark blue flowers, pollen shed as tetrads, and globose seeds with faint foveate sculpturing and colliculate surface cells. A. nana (also subgenus Eucapsulares), known from few collections, and also confused with A. pusilla or A. anceps Eckl. ex Klatt. has the unbranched and leafless flowering stem of the latter but has large green floral spathes, flowers borne on long pedicels, and lacks a leaf subtending the single terminal flower cluster in contrast to nearly sessile flowers in A. pusilla and A. anceps, and in the latter, dry, rusty spathes. A. cistiflora (subgenus Pseudaristea) closely resembles A. teretifoha Goldblatt J.C.Manning but has linear to narrowly sword-shaped leaves and ± secund flowers with the outer tepals only slightly smaller than the inner and with small, dark brown markings at the bases of all the tepals. In contrast, A. teretifolia has narrower, sometimes terete leaves and flowers held upright with the outer tepals notice-ably smaller than the inner and bearing dark markings covering the lower half, whereas the inner tepals are unmarked.",

This study, initiated in the late 1970s, therefore aids understanding of vegetation dynamics in the southern Kalahari by investigating woody vegetation change at and away from a watering point. Methods: At three sites, all woody individuals were counted by species in plots 0.5 or 1 ha in size. Seedlings were noted separately from the &gt;0.2 m group of individuals. Results: Vachellia erioloba and shrub density decreased over time whereas dwarf shrub species’ numbers fluctuated markedly. Additionally, no increase in density of known bush encroaching species (e.g. Grewia flava, Rhigozum trichotomum and Senegalia mellifera) was found in this large conservation area. Discussion and conclusion: The changes in density of the woody species seem to point to the importance of particular rainfall patterns or sequences of events over different years that are responsible for these changes in the southern Kalahari, and the evident lack of bush encroachment in this conservation area supports the notion that bush encroachment in arid savannas is driven primarily by land-use practices and not by elevated carbon dioxide levels that are sometimes provided as cause for encroachment.",

Presence of crystals was tested for in UV light. Phylogeny was inferred using sequencing of the LSU and ITS loci.Results: Pseudoplectania africana is characterised by shortly stipitate to sessile apothecia up to 18 mm broad, richly developed basal tomentum, ascospores with an eccentrically positioned, relatively small sheath, straight, sometimes bifurcate paraphyses, wavy to coiled external hairs and presence of large yellow crystals mainly in the hymenium and ectal excipulum. It was found on a decaying coniferous trunk. The species forms a distinct lineage in the clade with P. tasmanica and P. ericae. All of these three species exhibited presence of the large yellow crystals (sulphur yellow in UV light). No or only small hyaline crystals (whole mount blue in UV light) were found in P. nigrella, P. lignicola, P. episphagnum and P. melaena.Conclusion: The new species represents the first report of Pseudoplectania in South Africa and probably also in the whole of continental Africa. Crystals in hymenium and excipulum appear to be an important trait in Pseudoplectania taxonomy.",

Land transformation and disturbance of natural habitats have resulted in an ever-increasing fragmentation of the species’ range.Objectives: This manuscript provides a description of some of the abiotic and biotic factors associated with the remaining natural populations of C. nutans in the Sour Sandveld and Moist Tall Grassland Bioresource Groups of northwestern KwaZulu-Natal.Methods: An investigation was conducted in the northwestern KwaZulu-Natal region to determine the effect that key ecological and anthropological determinants have in influencing the distribution and survival of the species. Data collected included sites of occurrence, estimated population numbers, elevation, ecological factors (soils/geology, climate, veld composition), and human/animal activities.Results: The northwestern KwaZulu-Natal C. nutans populations were found to occur primarily in untransformed veld within the Moist Tall Grassveld, Dry Highland Sourveld and Sour Sandveld Bioresource Groups. It occurs largely on gradients of &lt; 10% on mid- to lower terrain slopes and predominantly within an altitude range of between 1 100 and 1 300 m a.m.s.l.Conclusion: C. nutans occurs in a narrow altitudinal range and has a preference for soils with high nitrogen and organic carbon and low phosphorus and acidity levels.",

    "abstract": "Background: The current status of plant ecology research in Ethiopia is unknown with the result that it is challenging to judge the impact of existing research on policy development and conservation actions.Objectives: The objective of this paper was to systematically analyse the trends in plant ecological research in Ethiopia over the past 50 years.Methods: The inclusion and exclusion of articles for analysis was carried out using the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) flow diagram developed for systematic review/meta-analysis.Results: The number of articles published, authors and collaboration has increased dramatically since the 1960s. Most of the research (52.6%) focused on the Dry evergreen Afromontane Forest and grassland complex (DAF) and Moist evergreen Afromontane Forest (MAF) vegetation types. Of the remaining vegetation types, woodlands (14.3%) i.e. Acacia–Commiphora woodland and bushland proper (ACW), and Combretum–Terminalia woodland and wooded grassland (CTW), desert and semi-desert scrubland (DSS) (2.3%), and the Afroalpine (AA) and Ericaceous Belt (EB) (1.5%) received comparatively little attention. Classical plant ecology themes and descriptive plant community studies were dominant over the last five decades in contrast to the focus on contemporary themes globally. Reproductive and dispersal ecology of invasive plant species and pollination ecology seem to be largely neglected topics. Furthermore, the recommendations forwarded by most of the articles reviewed (38.1%, n = 51) were not result-based. Conclusions: As a future direction, the Ethiopian government should develop a project database for both completed and ongoing projects.",

    "abstract": "Putative type specimens of 18 taxa described from Mozambique collected by Américo Pires de Lima at the beginning of the 20th century are kept in the African collections of the Herbarium of Porto (PO) at the MHNC-UP. These specimens were not collected as part of a dedicated scientific mission, but they and the scientific studies carried out by Pires de Lima represent an important contribution to Portuguese colonial projects. During his scientific career, and despite the lack of support and specialised literature, Pires de Lima described 17 species new to science. In this work we analysed part of the material collected by Pires de Lima, kept in PO at MHNC-UP. Today, only two of the 17 taxa described by Pires de Lima remain as accepted taxa, viz. Tephrosia reptans var. microfoliata (Pires de Lima) Brummitt and Crotalaria retusa var. tunguensis (Pires de Lima) Polhill. In addition, information on Polygala limae Exell, named after Pires de Lima, has also been analysed as this is still accepted. Of over 300 specimens collected by Pires de Lima in the early 20th century, some 40% remain unidentified due to lack of expertise. Undoubtedly, this collection contains many other promising specimens in need of revision, taxonomic update, and other novelties that can be found even in the more ancient and inconspicuous materials.",

    "abstract": "Background: In degraded environments such as oldfields, nurse plants can facilitate the growth of targeted restoration plant species through ameliorating them from extreme environmental conditions, creating nutrient rich microclimates, and protecting recruiting plants from grazing. Objectives: This study examined the role of Vachellia karroo nurse plant on soil physico-chemical properties and vegetation diversity in oldfields targeted for passive restoration at Tanglewood research farm in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Methods: Soil were quantified for physico-chemical properties in 48 plots measuring 25 m2 (5 m x 5 m) that were located under and outside 24 V. karroo nurse plants. In addition, detailed vegetation surveys were conducted in the above-mentioned plots. Results: Our results show that soil total N and C concentrations were higher under than outside V. karroo nurse plants. Soil penetration resistance and water repellency levels were lower under than outside V. karroo nurse plants, however monthly variations were also observed. Species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity were higher under than outside V. karroo nurse plants, with species such as Searsia crenata, Azima tetracantha, Asparagus africanus, and Opuntia sp., frequently occurring under V. karroo nurse plants. Conclusion: The study concludes that V. karroo nurse plant has a positive effect on some soil physico-chemical properties and vegetation diversity underneath it. It is recommended that V. karro needs to be included in future oldfield restoration strategies if passive restoration at Tanglewood research farm is to be successful.",

Many of these have become famous in cultivation around the world. Coffee now provides an important source of income for certain countries, and the Yams yield one of the world’s staple foods. The Oil Palm and Cola trees are widely cultivated in Africa itself and elsewhere. African Mahoganies and Ironwoods are much sought after timber trees of excellent quality. Numerous grasses and pulses are well-known for their food value, and some of the native Cucurbitaceae are appreciated additions to our vegetable diet. African plants have also made their contribution to horticulture, ranging from world-famous trees such as the African or Gabon Tulip tree and many of the South African species of Proteaceae to the multitude of East and South African succulents. The present paper provides a survey of the most important of these useful plants and will emphasize the need of further research for forestry and agricultural as well as horticultural purposes, especially as far as some still little-known but potentially important plants species are concerned.",

    "abstract": "The transectional anatomy of photosynthetic flowering culms of Arundinella berteroniana (Schult.) Hitchc. Chase and A. hispida (Willd.) Kuntze from South America and A. nepalensis Trin. from Africa is described and illustrated. The vascular bundles are arranged in three distinct rings, the outermost being external to a continuous sclerenchymatous band. Each of these peripheral bundles is surrounded by two bundle sheaths, a complete mestome sheath and an incomplete, outer, parenchymatous Kranz sheath, the cells of which contain large, specialized chloroplasts. Kranz bundle sheath extensions are also present. The chlorenchyma tissue is also located in this narrow peripheral zone and is interrupted by the vascular bundles and their associated sclerenchyma. Dispersed throughout the chlorenchyma are small groups of Kranz distinctive cells, identical in structure to the outer bundle sheath cells. No chlorenchyma cell is. therefore, more than two cells distant from a Kranz cell. The structure of the chlorenchyma and bundle sheaths indicates that the C4 photosynthetic pathway is operative in these culms. This study clearly demonstrates the presence of the peculiar distinctive cells in the culms as well as in the leaves of Arundinella. Also of interest is the presence of an inner bundle sheath in the vascular bundles of the culm whereas the bundles of the leaves possess only a single sheath. It has already been shown that Arundinella is a NADP-me C4 type and the anatomical predictor of a single Kranz sheath for NADP-me species, therefore, either does not hold in the culms of this genus or the culms are not NADP-me. This is only the second reported breakdown of this association between MS anatomy and the NADP-me biochemical C4 type.",

The purpose of this study is to try and provide a more natural classification of the species of Eragrostis, collected in Zaire, by using statistical methods. We have examined and compared 54 species with one another for a number of 'characters’: 17 characters of the vegetative structure, 28. of the* inflorescence, 20 microscopic characters of the leaf epidermis and 23 microscopic characters of the leaf anatomy. The methods used are divisive and agglomerative. We did not 'separate' quantitative and qualitative characters and gave the sUme priority rating to all characters. The three methods tested are: the Virtual Centres method; the similarity coefficient of Sorensen; and the coefficient of Gower. The coefficient of Gower proved to be best suited to our data and gave satisfactory results.",

    "abstract": "The genus Mariscus occurs over practically the whole of the Flora of Southern Africa (FSA) region, with the exception of the west coast and the Karoo region of the Cape Province. Practically no species occur under conditions of less than 250 mm of rain per annum, whereas the highest concentrations of subgenera/sections and species occur where the annual rainfall is more than 500 mm. All the species in the region are summer rainfall plants, or if they occur in the winter rainfall area they behave like summer rainfall plants. The different subgenera/sections recognized within the genus differ widely in respect of their water requirements, yet there is a general concentration of taxa in the eastern part of the country where the rainfall is higher than in the west. Nevertheless, the highest concentrations of taxa are not in the areas of highest rainfall, which suggests that topographical diversity is probably the most important factor determining concentrations of taxa. The geographical distribution of each subgenus/section in the FSA region is explained in relation to the total distribution of the subgenus/section. The possible climatic or environmental conditions which may determine the distribution of each subgenus/section are mentioned, and the concentration of species within each subgenus/section is demonstrated by means of maps.",

It concerns some coccoides, often grouped in more or less complex spheroides according to an evolutionary pattern that could be accurately established. The understanding of fossil forms from the Precambrian is, to a great extent, the result of an interpretation made of an included ‘black spot', which one adopted for the emissions of substance produced by these forms. Compared to the present species, the Precambrian organisms recall the coccoid Bacteria and the Cyanophyceae. These microorganisms are oolithes in origin and are by no means mineral, since they contain stain-sensitive glucides with Schiff’s reagent following the action of periodic acid. These forms, usually spherical, are classified amongst the Oncolithes. These organisms are also responsible for the massive calcareous or dolomitic reefs reaching considerable thickness and containing some known stromatolites in many parts of the world. Stromatolites are Conophyton. Collenia . . . They are spherical, lamellate or columnar. These reef formations of Africa reach a thickness of 3 000 m in the Adoudounian of Collenia of the Anti-Atlas, of 600 m in the Zemmour, of 150 m in the Adrar of Mauritania, of 100 m in the cliff of Hank in the north of the Taoudeni Basin.",

ABSTRACT Several protocols of plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis from Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench have been development, however the percentage of calluses with embryogenic structures and plant regeneration are low. Therefore this study aimed to generate somatic embryos in red sorghum variety CIAP 132-R. Different concentrations of 2,4-D for callus formation, and three concentrations of ascorbic acid to remove phenolics exudation were assayed by explant. For the formation of embryos different concentrations of 2,4-D and 6-BAP were evaluated. The highest percentage of callus formation (57.5 %) was achieved with 18.1 µM 2,4-D. With the addition to the culture medium of 50.0 mg.l -1 of ascorbic acid was possible to eliminate the phenolic compounds in the explant and in the culture medium; also it allows increasing the percentage of calluses with embryogenic structures up to 95 %. The highest number of somatic embryos per callus was achieved with a reduction in the culture medium of 2,4-D to 4.52 µM in combination with 2.22 µM 6-BAP. For the first time, the efficiency of somatic embryo formation was obtained from the freshly germinated sprouts of immature seeds as initial explant CIAP 132-R.",

The research objective was to evaluate possible interactions between physical-chemical soil attributes and plant-leaf nutrient concentrations of different mangrove species. Different mangrove species growing in the same soil, and the same mangrove species growing in two different soil classes were evaluated as to their leaf nutrient concentration patterns. The study was carried out in mangrove areas of the State of Parana, southern Brazil, in two distinct soil classes: HISTOSOL THIOMORPHIC Salic sodic and GLEYSOL THIOMORPHIC Salic sodic; and three different species:  Avicennia schaueriana ,  Laguncularia racemosa  and  Rhizophora mangle . Two subareas were delimited within each area from which soil and leaf samples were collected. Samplings from five individuals of each dominant mangrove species were taken from the soil (0-10 cm deep) under each tree crown projection. The data was submitted to statistical analysis using a set of simple and multivariate analysis in order to determine possible differences among mangrove species leaf nutrient concentrations, and whether these differences might be correlated with the soil attributes or not. The results exposed that the nutritional state of the mangrove species is different and independent form the soil attributes in which they grow. Few correlations were found among leaf nutrient concentrations and soil attributes, suggesting differential selective nutrient uptake among species.",

A checklist is important to provide basic information on the extent of the diversity, and to provide the most recent name and classification.Objective: To present a list of all the lichenised, lichenicolous and allied fungi reported from South Africa.Methods: The list presented is entirely literature based and no attempt has been made to check the report of any taxa or their status by checking the specimens upon which they are based. Firstly, all taxa that were not reported from within the modern boundaries of South Africa were excluded. Next, the Recent literature on lichens database was searched for literature on South African lichens since 1945 and all references checked for new species or new reports, which were then added to the list. These names were then checked against Index Fungorum to ensure that the most current name was being used. Finally, the list was rationalised by excluding all synonyms and dubious infraspecific taxa.Results: The current list includes 1750 taxa in 260 genera from mainland South Africa, with an additional 100 species and 23 genera from the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, which are treated separately. The replacement name Verrucaria dagolavii Fryday is proposed for Verrucaria umbilicata Øvstedal.Conclusion: It is estimated that, when fully explored, the lichen biota of South Africa will consist of somewhere between 2500 and 3000 taxa.",

    "abstract": "Background : Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is a key tool in conservation prioritisation. It has recently been applied within the eThekwini Municipal Area (EMA), South Africa, a rapidly developing metro located within a biodiversity hotspot. Most vegetation types within this region are threatened, yet have received limited scientific attention. Objectives : To assess forb biodiversity of coastal and near-coastal grasslands and contextualise potential drivers of species variation to the EMA context. Method : We quantified forb species richness, frequency and species composition, determined the variation of these amongst plots and sites, and assessed which variables were responsible for this variation. Results : Site forb species richness ranged from 33 to 84 species per site, with the most frequent species differing across the seven sites. Beta diversity was higher across than within sites. Distance to the closest traditional medicine market and site perimeter-to-area ratio were the greatest drivers of species richness, whilst altitude, aspect, mean temperature and rainfall seasonality were the main contributors to species composition patterns. Conclusion : SCP can use key environmental and climatic categories to improve selection of grasslands to maximise both species richness and variation in species composition. A more fine-scale systematic conservation plan will, in turn, provide a more robust basis for development decisions. The outcomes illustrate the importance of urban and peri-urban conservation efforts, including fine-scale conservation planning, in contributing to regional, national conservation targets.",

Based on a classification using numbers of stems of canopy species, it was assumed that basically only one forest community was sampled. Further multivariate analyses suggest that this forest is fine-grained. Sample plots were similarly placed in ordination space irrespective of whether woody species occurrence was used as importance value or if species occurrence per size class was used separately [seedlings (0.5-1.0 m), saplings (1-5 m) or canopy individuals ( 5 m)). An analysis of size-class distributions of the most common canopy species indicated that the majority of species exhibited inverse J-shaped size-class distributions. This is the expected pattern for a fine-grained forest. In these measures of dynamics, this forest is not fundamentally different to the more temperate Afromontane forests.",

The vegetation was classified using TWINSPAN. based on a combination of floristic and growth form characteristics, and an understanding of the main ecological gradients controlling vegetation distribution. The final classification described seven robust and eco­logically meaningful communities that represented a trade-off between statistical rigour and practicality for management. The seven communities were mapped using a geographical information system (GIS).",

All species are illustrated. Peltocalathos, a monotypic genus based on R. baurii MacOwan, has been overlooked in the regional literature until now. The new name R. dregei J.C.Manning Goldblatt is proposed as a replacement name for the later homonym R. meyeri Harv., non Lowe. We conclude that the poorly known R. capensis Thunb. represents juvenile forms of the widespread and variable R. multifidus Forssk. and we synonymise the name, along with the three trivial epithets R. pinnatus var. hermannii DC., R. pubescens var. glabrescens Burtt Davy and R. pubescens var. harveyanus Burtt Davy, which have been overlooked in the recent literature. Based on number (mostly 40 achenes per head) and size (mostly 1.2–1.8 mm long) of achenes, we conclude that the southern African material of the aquatic species recently re-identified as R. rionii Lagger is more appropriately treated as R. trichophyllus Chaix.",

The undulate leaves together with the long filaments, which are nearly as long as the tepals, suggest a relationship with O. undulatum, a widespread species in the western parts of southern Africa, and O. zeyheri from Namaqualand and the northwestern Cape.",

P. montivagus Bredenkamp A.E.van Wyk, which is also described. The new taxa are geographically separated: subsp. filiformis ranges from Piquetberg in the north through the Cape Peninsula in the south, where it is quite com­mon. to Attaquaskloof in the southwestern Cape: subsp. glutinosa occurs along the coast between Vredendal and St Helena Bay; and P. montivagus has a wide distribution from Mossel Bay and Oudtshoom in the south through Eastern Cape and along the Great Escarpment northwards to Zimbabwe, with outliers in Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "Cytogenetic studies of 45 specimens, representing 16 taxa of the genus Pentaschistis (Nees) Spach confirmed two basic chromosome numbers (x = 7, 13) for the genus. Chromosome numbers for five species and one subspecies are described for the first time, i.e. P. aimides subsp. jugorum (n = 2x = 14). P. colorata (n = 2x = 14). P densifolia (n = x = 7), P. linui (n = 6x = ± 42), P. rigidissima (n = x = 7, n = 3x = 21) and P viscidula (n = 3x = 21). Polyploidy occurs frequently and new ploidy levels are described m four of the species, namely P airoides (Nees) Stapf subsp. airoides (n = 3x = 21), P. cir- rhulosa (Thunb.) McClean (n = x = 7), P. eriostoma (Nees) Stapf (n = 3x = 39+0-4B) and P rupestris (n = 4x = 28) The majority of species form young polyploid complexes. There seems to be no correlation between cytogenetic data and mor­phological groupings within Pentaschistis.",

    "abstract": "Background: This study quantified the fine-scale habitat requirements of Chrysoritis aureus, at 11 known habitats in Gauteng and Mpumalanga, South Africa, in order to make habitat management recommendations for this endangered species.Objectives: The habitats were quantified in terms of plant species composition and structure with reference to their environmental characteristics.Method: A modified area-based phytosociological approach was used to collect floristic data along with environmental characteristics of habitats occurring on the Witwatersrand and Ventersdorp Geological Systems.Results: Species recorded were predominantly forbs and graminoids with a slightly higher number of plant species in the habitats of the Ventersdorp Geological System. Few dwarf shrubs and shrubs and very few trees were recorded. A higher number of plant species were recorded during the late growing season on both geological systems. The butterfly food plant Clutia pulchella var. pulchella L. (Euphorbiaceae) was recorded in all the habitats and was dominant in habitats in both geological systems. The occurrence of the food plant is essential for the survival of the butterfly at these habitats.Conclusion: Monitoring of the C. aureus butterfly populations and of the vegetation structure, species composition and growth forms to determine trends in the vegetation condition after planned fires; regular burning of the habitats in order to maintain suitable vegetation composition and structure; and the monitoring and eradication of alien invader plants are very important management activities to ensure the conservation of C. aureus.",

    "abstract": "Background: In South Africa, and globally, the value of natural science collections for scientific research is not widely recognised and has led to its marginalisation, which in turn has resulted in low funding, staffing and use of the collections. Aim &amp; objectives: To this end, as part of the effort to increase understanding and appreciation of the collections, a cross-sectional web-based survey was administered to users of natural science collections (NSCs) in South Africa. The objectives of the study were to identify the perceived value of NSCs to the research community; perceived or experienced barriers in accessing NSCs and associated data for use in research; perceptions of NSCs’ current performance in serving the needs of stakeholders; and how performance is judged and what the expectations are to improve future performance of NSCs to better serve the needs of stakeholders. Methods: The survey consisted of 26 questions, distributed by email to relevant researcher community mailing lists, and posted on relevant social media groups. The survey was completed by 131 respondents. Results &amp; conclusion: The study indicated the overall perception of the importance of NSCs and their accessibility to the student and researcher community in South Africa and internationally to be extremely important to their research. Lack of funding for operations and staff impedes the ability of researchers and other users alike in using NSCs to optimise their research and contribute to issues of societal concern. A sustained commitment is required from NSC institutions to work together to solve various challenges, including improvement in serving stakeholder needs, which will in turn assist with demonstrating the value of NSCs to policymakers, in order to lobby for support and funding. Improved recognition of the importance of NSCs for research by the scientific community will assist NSCs in demonstrating their impact. Political priority should also be given to the long-term upkeep and ongoing assistance of institutional infrastructures.",

Objectives: We investigated the effect of distance (5, 30, 50 and 70 metres) from the mining sites on species richness, abundance and composition of surface-active arthropods, as well as composition and concentration of soil chemical properties (soil pH, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc). Methods: The study was conducted at two mining sites in Nyandeni Local Municipality within the O.R. Tambo District Municipality that were commissioned in 2014. Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps and thereafter sorted into morphospecies, while an auger was used to collect soil samples. Permutational multivariate analysis was used to compare the composition of the arthropods and soil chemical properties among distances from the mining activities, while arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as concentrations of soil chemical properties, were analysed using the one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Arthropod species richness, abundance and composition were not influenced by distance from mining activities. Although among soil chemical properties, mining activities altered the concentration of zinc only, we found dissimilarities in soil composition between the sampling point at the edge of the mining activities and sampling points that were away from the mining sites. Conclusion: We found no evidence of the impact of crushed stone mining on surface-active arthropods; however, our study revealed a negative impact of crushed stone mining on soil chemical properties.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: The Eastern Cape province of South Africa has a rich floral diversity, with seven of the country’s eight floral biomes represented in the province. The non-acarine arachnid fauna of the province is largely understudied and considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of the distribution, diversity and levels of endemism of the arachnid fauna. Objectives: To address this, non-acarine arachnids were sampled intensively in the Afromontane forests and surrounding biotopes in the Amathole Mountains over the course of a decade. Methods: In the present contribution, comprehensive checklists of the non-acarine arachnids (specifically, the orders Amblypygi, Araneae, Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones and Scorpiones) of the region are presented, based on a combination of field sampling, provenance data from museum specimen databases, and a review of the historical literature. Results: In total, 398 species of non-acarine arachnids have been recorded from the Amathole Mountains, with spiders (Araneae; 324 species from 51 families) and harvestmen (Opiliones; 41 species from four families) the richest groups. The region is exceptionally rich in harvestmen and pseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpiones; 24 species from 11 families), and might be considered a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism for these taxa. Conclusion: As the sampling was concentrated around Hogsback, and most other areas remain undersampled, further efforts should be made to sample all representative biotopes more comprehensively in the mountain range. This will improve understanding of the distribution and endemism of the arachnid fauna and assess the conservation significance of the region from a national perspective.",

Morphological as well as genetic characters are investigated to confirm the identity of a putative hybrid between C. triloba and C. macrocarpa. These two independent data sets, one from enzyme electrophoresis and one from morphology, are compared and interpreted by means of cladistic analysis. Centella glauca and C. virgata were included in the analysis and the effect of hybridization on cladistics is demonstrated. Hybridization gives a new perspective on infrageneric relationships within the genus Centella, as it may have obscured discontinuities between previously discrete infrageneric groups.",

To rectify the position a National Weed List has been compiled, the weeds have been classified and an analysis made of the weed flora. Aspects covered in this paper are: major taxa, exotic and indigenous species and kinds of weeds. The presence of imbalances or power shifts between indigenous taxa is indicated by the fact that most weeds are supplied by a few families, and that Monocotyledon species are twice as likely to be weeds as are Dicotyledon species. The preponderance of Monocotyledon weeds is explained by re-invasion of cultivated and abandoned fields in grassland areas rather than by a shift towards Monocotyledon species in the veld. Exotic weeds contribute to imbalances via their greater versatility as well as by re-inforcing some taxa or kind of weed groupings at the expense of others. There is a power shift towards exotic Gymnosperms. Apart from flora weeds, exotics provide most agrestals, lawn weeds and weeds of planted pastures, and nearly as many ruderals as the indigenous species.",

    "abstract": "A bioclimatic unit is an integration of climatic factors (e.g. radiation, humidity complexes) and features modified by physiography and vegetation (biotic communities and associated habitats, i.e. wherever possible, ecosystems). Unit implies an entity irrespective of ecological status and dimensions: these are otherwise differentiated. It often must suffice to use vegetation communities, because information regarding biotic communities or ecosystems is unavailable. Increasingly, disturbance of ‘natural’ conditions makes it imperative to involve man in the classification, demarcation and policy for the development of bioclimatic units. Ignorance regarding the nature and distribution of a climax necessitates using pro- (pre- or post-) climaxes.This is based upon the differentiation in these criteria: climatic (radiation and humidity complexes); vegetation (physiognomy and ecological status) . . . and as these are further modified by physiography and edaphic features (physiognomic differentiation ranges from specific faciations of forest or thicket); wooded savanna (facies ofwoodland, shrubland); facies or faciations of grassland; climatic differentiation ranges from highly humid toarid . . . and further to subdesert and desert. Recommendations respecting policy and practice in pastoral, crop production and forestry development based on this concept have been used in various sectors of Africa. South East Asia and Latin America. Detailed experience has been gained in Natal and elsewhere. Several maps illustrate the application of the concept.",

In 1872 on the recommendation of the director of Kew Gardens, Keit emigrated to Natal to become curator of the Durban Botanic Garden. So dilapidated was this garden that Keit was faced with the task of virtually re-establishing it.Though he was largely successful in this endeavour, as he was in fortifying the link between Natal and Kew, Keit could not solve the problems of a severe drought,a labour shortage and a scarcity of funds. In 1881 he resigned his position leaving a solid foundation on which the renowned botanist, John Medley Wood was to build. Keit in later Ufe ran a successful nursery in Durban and for 30 years was curator of the Parks and Gardens Department,in which capacity he did more than anyone else to beautify Durban.",

The anatomical evidence strongly refutes a chloridoid relationship for Elytrophorus but appears to support arundinoid affinities for the genus. Striking anatomical and ecological similarities exist between Elytrophorus and Sacciolepis huillensis (Rendle) Stapf. No significant leaf anatomical differences separate Elytrophorus from S. huillensis and some of the other C3 panicoid taxa and. consequently, Elytro­phorus may represent a link between the Arundinoideae and the Panicoideae.",

For a brief period he was Curator of the Fielding Herbarium, Oxford. In 1953 he was appointed Lecturer in Botany at the University of Cape Town, until in 1973 he was awarded a full professorship (ad hominem) and the title of Director of the Bolus Herbarium. Here he established a school of taxonomy and promoted 22 theses. His main fields of research were the taxonomy and phytogeography of Pteridophyta (especially African groups) and of Orchidaceae.He has 112 publications to his credit and collected over 7 000 numbers in various regions of Africa, in Europe and the Himalayas. He was a keen gardener and was active in several societies promoting horticulture, orchidology and nature conservation. He was a member of several scientific committees and was repeatedly honoured for his work.Three children were born from his marriage to Sybella Gray, also a botanist.",

D. maculata is characterized by a slightly gibbous corolla with no spurs or sacs, erect stamens, and a distinct patch of oil-secreting trichomes in the tube at the base of each upper and lateral corolla lobe. D. humilis is characterized by a bisaccate corolla, forward projecting stamens and oil-secreting trichomes localized in corolla sacs. The third new species, D hexensis K.E. Steiner, is most similar to D. sacculata Benth.. but it differs from that species by its larger flowers and much longer spurs which curve downward instead of upward.",

No voucher specimens were collected for the northern population, but photographs of key features were taken and compared with specimens in online herbaria. A voucher specimen was taken for the southern population.Results: Two new populations and a northern range extension for E. hastatum are recorded. The species is assessed as Endangered EN B2ab(iii) according to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Criteria. Only one of the five known localities for this species is protected.Conclusion: The conservation assessment of this species highlights the importance of coastaldune thicket for range-restricted species in southern Mozambique.",

    "abstract": "Background: Quisqualis parviflora Gerrard ex. Sond. is endemic to the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, South Africa. The species’ distribution has previously been thought to extend to Mpumalanga and the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. Most published distributions include Maputaland in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal, and it has been suggested that the species may occur in Mozambique. Sterile material of several Combretum Loefl. lianas may be confused with Q. parviflora.Although the species may be locally common, it has never been collected in fruit. Published fruit descriptions are based on erroneously identified material.Objectives: The aim of this study was to supply a revised distribution range, to describe the fruit of Q. parviflora and to present notes on the phenology and ecology of the species.Method: Herbarium specimens of Q. parviflora, and similar taxa, were examined in various herbaria. Fieldwork was undertaken, and other active field botanists were consulted.Results: Quisqualis parviflora is almost entirely restricted to scarp forest between Port St. Johns in the Eastern Cape and Eshowe in KwaZulu-Natal. Although the species may be locally common, it has only been collected from a few localities. The current dispersal ability of the species may be extremely limited, which could have long-term conservation implications.Samaras are described, and notes are provided on the phenology and ecology of the species.Conclusion: Although not currently threatened, the long-term prospects of Q. parviflora may be less secure. Proposed forest management interventions like liana thinning should not be undertaken without more information.",

No Espirito Santo, sobretudo na capital capixaba, o principal fator degradante consiste no desenvolvimento urbano. Este trabalho visou avaliar o impacto da ampliacao do aeroporto de Vitoria, no contexto da ecologia da paisagem, focando manchas de vegetacao predominantemente naturais. Utilizaram-se tecnicas de fotointerpretacao e vetorizacao das imagens de satelite referentes a maio/2005, setembro/2009 e agosto/2017, em alusao ao inicio, meio e fim das obras aeroportuarias. Vetores foram convertidos em raster e tratados no programa Fragstats, que mensura a dinâmica das modificacoes na paisagem. A comparacao temporal demonstrou o quao impactante foi o empreendimento, de tal modo que a classe complexo de restinga teve a metrica (mensuracao) de area diminuida em 42% e deixou de ser a feicao dominante da paisagem, sendo substituida por perimetro urbano (incremento de 7%) e, ainda, superada por infraestrutura aeroportuaria (210% de aumento). A cobertura vegetal sofreu retracao de 74% na area-nucleo e acrescimo de 30% no indice de forma, enquanto o resultado de vizinho mais proximo apresentou variacao decorrente da fragmentacao da florula. O empreendimento interferiu demasiadamente na espacializacao da restinga, alterando as proporcoes da composicao paisagistica.",

The experiment took place at the Seed Laboratory and at the experimental field of Varzea Grande University Center (Univag), Mato Grosso. Seeds of this species were purchased in commercial packaging. The seeded materials were arranged in the greenhouse with 50% shading (Sombrite®) and in full sun, both with daily irrigation. Growth assessment was performed from the seventh day after emergence. The number of emerged plants was evaluated from the first week after sowing until the establishment of seedlings.Analysis of variance was performed by Tukey test at 5% and regression analysis. The germination test showed 71% of normal seedlings, a lower value than the minimum germination described in the package, and emergence and establishment of 32% of the seedlings. The evaluated conditions, in greenhouse under 50% shading, were favorable to the production of Dahlia pinnata, even when commercial seeds presented low germination potential.",

A amplitude de temperatura para a atividade foi de 12 a 41oC; para umidade relativa, de 39,5 a 100%. O recurso mais coletado foi o nectar (durante as quatro estacoes), seguido pelo polen. Resina e barro foram coletados em temperaturas mais elevadas do que polen e nectar. O movimento externo mostrou correlacao negativa com a temperatura e positiva com a umidade relativa.

O experimento aconteceu no Laboratorio de Micropropagacao Vegetal da Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina, em Lages. Foram estudados dois estados fisicos do meio de cultura MS (solido e liquido) e dois metodos de superacao da dormencia (acido sulfurico 96% e agua quente a 80oC). Aos 40 dias, avaliaram-se o percentual germinativo, o comprimento medio de plântula (cm) e o indice de velocidade de germinacao (IVG). Nao houve interacao entre os fatores estudados, portanto, foram analisados individualmente. A maior taxa de germinacao (75%), o maior comprimento medio de plântulas (1,10 cm) e o maior IVG foram obtidos com o cultivo das sementes em meio liquido. A superacao da dormencia das sementes, efetuada com a agua quente, proporcionou a maior germinacao (66%), o maior comprimento medio de plântula (0,96 cm) e o maior IVG. O cultivo em meio liquido e a pre-imersao das sementes em agua quente (80oC) mostraram-se eficientes e podem ser recomendados para o estabelecimento in vitro de aracazeiro-vermelho.",

A pesquisa foi realizada utilizando os canteiros da arborizacao viaria com presenca de composicao paisagistica em 16 bairros e seis zonas residenciais da Regional Matriz. Fez-se uma amostragem estratificada totalizando 82 residencias. As coletas de campo foram efetuadas no mes de abril de 2017 e consistiram em aplicar questionario com 10 perguntas para cada residencia amostrada, em que se abordaram o perfil dos entrevistados e a percepcao deles sobre os canteiros. Em 82 residencias foram encontradas pessoas disponiveis para participar da pesquisa. Grande parte dos entrevistados (63) respondeu que aquele espaco tinha valor estetico. Boa parte dos moradores (77%) que participou da pesquisa soube citar o nome de pelo menos uma especie plantada em frente a sua casa e, destes, apenas 23% lembraram de uma especie nativa. Conclui-se que os moradores reconhecem a funcao estetica dos canteiros e contribuem com a composicao paisagistica destes em frente a sua residencia.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Species composition and distribution in seasonal floodplain plant communities are influenced by variation in flooding. However, the influence of intra-flooding variation phases on the diversity of seasonalfloodplain plant communities has not been studied in the Okavango Delta. The objective of this study was to investigate environmental factors that influence species composition and distribution of seasonal floodplain communities beforeand after flooding. It was hypothesised that environmental factors that influence the species composition and distribution in seasonal floodplain communities will vary with intra-flooding seasons.Methods: Flooding depth was measured in May (before flooding) and September (flood recession/after flooding) in forty 25 m2 plots. Flooding duration was recorded as the number of weeks in which the plots were inundated. The soil was sampled before and after floods and analysed for pH, extractable P, K, Mg, Ca and Na. Plant identification and estimation of percentage cover were done in the 25 m2 plots in which environmental variables were sampled. The relationshipbetween environmental variables and seasonal floodplain plant community composition and distribution was sought using Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling. Paired Student’s t test was used to compare the means of environmentalvariables before and after flooding.Results: Factors that influenced the distribution of species before flooding were Na, K, water depth and flooding duration. After flooding, the factors that influenced species composition and distribution were K, Na, Mg, pH, water depth and flooding duration.Conclusion: These results suggest that during flooding K and Mg are deposited in the floodplains due to lateral water flow. Our results also suggest that any water abstraction from the Okavango River Basin should take into consideration theimportance of flooding duration and depth in sustaining species composition and distribution of seasonal floodplain plant communities so that such developments do not disturb the ecological functioning of the Delta.",

A area de estudo compreendeu 24 municipios do Rio Grande do Sul, distribuidos ao longo de um segmento de 390 km da   BR-116. A quantidade de material combustivel arboreo foi obtida do inventario da vegetacao do extrato arboreo existente na faixa de dominio da BR-116 ao longo do segmento avaliado.

O risco de incendio foi estimado com base no volume de material combustivel arboreo por hectare e no numero de focos de calor em cada municipio. Atribuiram-se cinco classes que correspondem aos riscos baixo, moderado, alto, muito alto e extremo. Os maiores riscos de incendio foram verificados nos municipios localizados ao norte do segmento da BR-116, no trecho que vai de Vacaria a Dois Irmaos. Nesses municipios, que apresentam niveis de risco de incendio extremo e muito alto, devem ser priorizadas acoes de prevencao de incendios florestais no trecho do segmento da BR-116.",

Terminalia catappa foi a especie de planta com mais eventos de alimentacao (n = 6) e foi a unica consumida pelas duas especies de araras. Todas as sementes consumidas foram predadas. Desse modo, as araras desempenham um importante papel ao atuar no controle populacional de especies de plantas nao nativas.

    "abstract": "Background: Deforestation is a complex and dynamic process of widespread concern in sub-Saharan Africa which is influenced by a range of social, economic and biophysical factors. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse patterns of deforestation and its potential drivers in the Licuáti Forest Reserve, a biodiversity hotspot in southern Mozambique between 1990 and 2016. Method: We performed image classification on Landsat imagery at six time steps and interviewed local community members to understand the spatial pattern and rate of forest cover loss over time. We also examined changes in the incidence of fire. Results: A substantial increase in the rate of deforestation since 1990 was detected in this vulnerable thicket vegetation. The probability of deforestation was significantly higher near the major roads, where houses are located. This suggests that the proximity of human settlements to the forest, and access to charcoal markets in urban areas, influenced the spatial pattern. Two key factors 1) charcoal production, and 2) the establishment of settlements and agricultural lands were identified as proximate causes of deforestation. In addition, fires associated with these two causes might amplify the loss of forests in the area. Conclusions: Complex interactions between the drivers of deforestation and socio-economic factors were suggested, as most of the charcoal produced in the region is transported to Maputo. Ongoing road improvements and infrastructural development in the region will likely accelerate the decline in forest cover in the future. This has implications for the biodiversity of the region as well as for the sustainability of local livelihoods, as they often depend on forest products for their daily uses.",

This study, initiated in the late 1970s, therefore aids understanding of vegetation dynamics in the southern Kalahari by investigating woody vegetationchange at and away from a watering point.Methods: At three sites, all woody individuals were counted by species in plots 0.5 or 1 ha in size. Seedlings were noted separately from the &gt;0.2 m group of individuals.Results: Vachellia erioloba and shrub density decreased over time whereas dwarf shrub species’ numbers fluctuated markedly. Additionally, no increase in density of known bush encroaching species (e.g. Grewia flava, Rhigozum trichotomumand Senegalia mellifera) was found in this large conservation area.Discussion and conclusion: The changes in density of the woody species seem to point to the importance of particular rainfall patterns or sequences of events over different years that are responsible for these changes in the southern Kalahari, and the evident lack of bush encroachment in this conservation area supports the notion that bush encroachment in arid savannas is driven primarily by land-use practices and not by elevated carbon dioxide levels that are sometimes provided as cause for encroachment.",

The plant communities of the natural vegetation inhabiting the coastline are a mixture of coastal thicket, riparian thicket, fynbos and rocky headland types. The extent of natural vegetation has been reduced by the spread of agricultural land and urban development and is under further threat from the spread of naturalised alien invader species, particularly Acacia cyclops. The checklist records the occurrence of 271 taxa including 16 alien species (6% of taxa). Of the flowering plant species recorded, 6% were regional or local endemics.",

Consequently it was considered necessary to re-examine these species in preparation for the account of Acacia for the Flora of Southern Africa. Distribution maps of the two species are provided and the differences between the species tabulated and discussed. Despite certain difficulties in Natal. Brenan's taxonomic conclusions are adopted. A map showing the distribution of A. schweinfurthii and A. brevispica subsp. dregeana in Natal is provided and a selection of Natal specimens cited.",

All relevant literature was consulted.Results: The Avontuur Arctotis is morphologically distinct from A. acaulis L. var. acaulis, A. acaulis var. undulata DC. and A. verbascifolia Harv.Conclusion: Arctotis gazanioides R.J.McKenzie &amp; Helme is described as a new species distinguished by its branching rhizomatous root system with abundant fibrous adventitious roots, and discolorous leaves that are simple lanceolate, lanceolate-ovate to lanceolate-elliptic, or pinnatisect with a lanceolate to lanceolate-elliptic terminal lobe.",

Congo) and Burundi: Achyrospermum africanum, A. axillare, A. oblongifolium, A. tisserantii, Leucas deflexa var. kondowensis, L. fulvipila,L. songeana, Stachys pseudohumifusa subsp. minutiflora, S. pseudonigricans, Tinneagracilis. For several species, the new localities are remarkably distant from the species’ previously known distribution area. New localities of five rare taxa are also included (Achyrospermum micranthum, Leucas nyassae, L. stormsii var. parviflora, Tinnea coerulea var. linearifolia, T. platyphylla). Many new localities are situated in regions subject to strong anthropogenic pressure.Conclusion: The new records increase the number of accepted species of Lamioideae and Scutellarioideae in Central Africa by 27%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Didymoplexis verrucosa is a cryptic leafless saprophytic ground orchid (~70 mm tall) growing on the coastal forest floors of southern Zululand and classified as Vulnerable (D2). As part of a population monitoring programme, 960 man-hours of species specific searching over five consecutive flowering seasons were conducted, yielding only one individual plant. Objective: The aim of this study was to increase detection rate by developing a profile of environmental indicators for the accurate identification of suitable habitat. Methods: A detailed description of suitable habitat was compiled based on the Braun-Blanquet approach. Results: The results showed that key attributes shared by localities include similar topographic position in the landscape, hydrology, soils, vegetation composition and structure, forest age, leaf-litter composition of the forest floor, the co-occurrence of Isoglossa woodii, and a similar degree of protection from sunlight, wind and desiccation. Significance of the findings: This profile of essential habitat characteristics can be used as a surrogate in the absence of actual locality data when identifying target conservation areas and compiling management strategies for this very cryptic species. A by-product of this habitat analysis was the discovery of a long list of impacts on the long term survival of D. verrucosa. The combination of these stochastic and deterministic events will drive habitat change at rates beyond the species’ ability to adapt. Managing these variables forms the crux of its successful conservation. A conservation status revision, based on the formal IUCN criteria, indicate that D. verrucosa should be reclassified as Critically Endangered Category B2a and D.",

    "abstract": "Background: Maputo Special Reserve (MSR) in Mozambique lays within the Maputaland Centre of Endemism (MCE) and protects the biota of a habitat mosaic dominated by coastal dune forest and inland sand forest patches of different sizes surrounded by natural grassland. Objectives: To determine the importance of woody versus grassland vegetation for supporting endemic east coast versus widespread savanna dung beetles in the MCE in the face of increased accessibility and exploitation of woody vegetation in southern Mozambique, especially by charcoal burners.Method: We used general linear mixed models, additive partitioning of diversity and ordination to analyse species abundance and occurrence across a mosaic of three major habitats in the MSR (grassland, sand and dune forest).Results: High compositional heterogeneity was found between habitat types and study sites so that beta diversity was mostly higher than alpha diversity. Three distinct scarabaeine dung beetle assemblages defined from ordination were largely centred on the three habitat types. Out of a total of 61 species, greater numbers were associated with grassland (38) than sand (17) and dune forest (6) although abundance was greater in both dune forest and grassland than in sand forest. Biogeographical classification indicated that &gt;40% of the species are endemic to the east coast of southern Africa with the remainder centred in adjacent savanna. Endemic east coast species were well represented in both forest (15) and grassland (11). Savanna species were better represented in grassland (27) than forest (8). Proportions of grassland species and their abundance declined across increasing patch sizes of sand forest becoming lowest in dune forest.Conclusions: Conservation of endemic, east coast dung beetle species requires the preservation of both natural grassland and sizeable patches of forest in an undisturbed habitat mosaic. As the east coastal system is relatively small in extent with the MCE widely transformed in South Africa, the MSR is an important contributor to regional conservation of endemic species.",

At most sites, the actual and predicted start and end of the growing season agreed closely.

    "abstract": "THE DISCOVERY OF PETRIFIED FOSSILS IN THE HIGH RUSIZI PLAIN (BURUNDI)Palaeobotanical research in Central Africa is still very fragmentary. In Burundi, apart from the very classical and abundant stromatolites of the Mosso (in the south of the country), Sah (1967) has indicated the occurrence of vegetal debris in the fluviolacustrian sediments o f the mid-upper Rusizi plain. These fragments have never been identified, but a study of the pollen grains found in sedimentary layers of the same age has revealed some features of the vegetation and of the climate prevailing in the Upper Neogene period.In November 1978 we discovered in north-western Burundi a deposit of petrified trunks of exceptional size. These fossils had been exposed a short time previously when a small quarry was established. The deposit contained four trunks, two of which were large: length, 1 m; diameter, 90 cm; weight, more than 1 000 kg.Initial macro and submicrospic examination of fragments showed an anatomical structure similar to the structure of some fossils described in Kivu (Zaire) and belonging to the family Caesalpiniaceae.Samples were sent to Tervuren (R. Dechamps) and to Liêge (Mrs Demaret) and their joint studies revealed that these trunks belong to the genus Julbernardia and probably to J. globiflora. Their age would be about 1 200 000 years.Since then, other trunks have been found (at least ten). According to our study, it is concluded that they have a very different structure from those of the previous specimens. Samples were sent to Tervuren and to Liêge for further study and the conclusions from the specialists should be available very soon.",

This garden made history by concentrating exclusively on the flora of its own country. A series of regional gardens have also been established to display and cultivate local floras. Internationally there has been a growing awareness of the necessity for conservation of natural resources. We have been in the forefront in conserving our vegetation, and in creating a ‘gene’ bank of indigenous plants. Large numbers of species are introduced into our gardens, where they are cultivated, studied, displayed, and their place in the flora determined. But this is only the beginning. Plants and vegetation must be evaluated within the total concept of the biological and physical milieu. Research, into the taxonomy and cultivation of horticulturally promising taxa is undertaken and should be intensified. Botanic gardens are people-orientated and the information on nature available must be disseminated. The next stage in the development of our botanic gardens is the development of an education section. The time has also come to consider the development of a parallel system of regional exotic botanic gardens to complement the present indigenous gardens. Such a development would be complementary to the original concept and not in competition. The South African flora will remain the most important subject in the N.B.G., but South Africans must also have the opportunity to learn about other floras.",

Exotics probably have their greatest impact in the aquatic habitat where they almost equal in number of species (the ratio is 3:5) and out-perform the indigenous aquatic flora. In the streambank habitat exotic weed species, mostly trees, outnumber indigenous weed species by more than 3 to 1. They are completely replacing indigenous streambank communities in many places. An investigation of their effect on stream flow and water loss is urgently required. The problems of the winter rainfall area are highlighted by the fact that it has 300% more indigenous species and 109% more weed species per unit area than the summer and all year rainfall areas. In the veld as a whole there is a significant and so far unremarked invasion by exotic annuals. The major invasive weed groupings are herbs from Europe and Asia and trees from Australia but South America probably has the greatest potential to provide us with new and dangerous weeds. A comparison of the weed floras of the southern continents could contribute much to an understanding of our own weed flora.",

    "abstract": "THE PRESENT STATE OF RESEARCH ON THE FLORA AND VEGETATION OF RWANDA ANDBURUNDI At the end of the last century, many explorers, mainly Germans, travelled in Burundi searching for the famous sources of the Nile and the legendary ‘Mountains of the Moon. ’ Apart from the very often accurate descriptions of the vegetation and flora they encountered, one is indebted to them for the rich harvest of specimens collected, many of which were destroyed in the bombing of Berlin in 1944-1945. When, in 1919, Burundi was placed under Belgian mandate, Belgian botanists took over the work and collected numerous specimens in the country. Their expeditions were organized from Zaire and were often of short duration, with the result that in 1965 there was still no systematic exploration of the country and in 1964 AETFAT classified Burundi as one of the lesser known areas in Africa. Systematic exploration of the country began in 1965 with J. Lewalle. Apart from the publication of an excellent work on the stratification of the vegetation, he collected more than 6 500 numbers of herbarium specimens, several of which represented new species. He worked in Burundi until 1972. From 1970 to 1980, Reekmans collected more than 9 500 specimens for the herbarium, mainly in the areas that were not intensively explored previously. He has published several works in connection with the phenology o f species and vegetation association of western Burundi. Many botanists invited by Lewalle and Reekmans, have had the opportunity to explore the country and to collect specimens of special groups. At present, it can be said that, except for a very small area of the country (otherwise well known in Rwanda where several studies have been made) the flora of Burundi is now well known. Phytogeographical limits are well established and the publication of a vegetation map is due in the near future. A catalogue of the country’s flora is also to be published shortly. Apart from these ‘scientific’ results, botanical studies in Burundi have also had the result of awakening the authorities to the ‘value’ of their natural heritage — to such an extent that in March 1980 a National Institute of Nature Conserx’ation was created. Its first aim will be to ensure the establishment of natural parks and several natural reserves in which some very interesting species will be preserved.",

    "abstract": "The Mesembryanthemaceae, which inhabit the deserts and semi-deserts of Southern Africa, exhibit two very different types of epidermis. The first is characterized by thick outer cell walls encrusted by oxalate crystals, a thick cuticle and thick wax layers. In the second type, the epidermal cells exhibit only very thin outer cell walls, not encrusted by oxalate crystals, a very thin cuticle, and wax layers are poorly developed; the most prominent feature of this type is the occurrence of huge idioblasts often protruding as ‘bladder cells’. With regard to the climatic conditions in the native habitats this type of epidermis must be called ‘abnormal’. Both types of epidermis may form sculptures of three distinct size classes, which are not necessarily homologous. The function of these sculptures is still poorly understood. There is evidence that the sculptures influence the optical properties of the surfaces and thereby the radiation balance (and heat stress) of the leaves.From recent research, it has become evident that the two different types of epidermis are the anatomical expression of two different strategies for survival under extreme conditions. Species with the idioblast type of epidermis exhibit a strategy that might be called ‘opportunistic’. These species have developed a mechanism of gaining water from the atmosphere during the night under favourable conditions. There are indications that the idioblasts are involved in this mechanism.",

In both genera the mural sets anastomose to form common muri that extend from near the distal pole to the equatorial radial region. The muri in Mohria are hollow and differ from those in Anemia which are solid or microporate. Supramural sculpturing in Mohria and Anemia is perinous. Spores of the other schizaealean ferns show no or little taxonomic affinities with Mohria and Anemia. In Actinostachys and Schizaea the spores are monolete and in Lygodium trilete but the exinal sculpture is smooth.",

Predicted data were validated by comparison with specific growth rates measured for plants growing in loosely and densely crowded populations at two field sites. The use of culture-derived maximum specific growth rates (Umax) in the model resulted in maccurate predictions of plant growth rates in loosely and densely crowdcd field populations. The use of field-derived Umax values in the model, however, resulted in adequate predictions of plant growth rates in loosely crowded field populations. The incorporation of radiant flux density (diffuse component of the radiant flux) and relative humidity into the model considerably improved its accuracy of prediction. In all cases, specific growth rates were more accurately predicted from the limiting total N or total P concentrations, than from other N or P fractions, in the water.",
