    "abstract": "The main goal of each investor when investing capital is to recover funds. The current market brings unlimited opportunities in creating an investment strategy. This strategy is highly dependent on the investor's preferences, his attitude to risk, financial capacity, expected return, self-interest, and many other factors that determine what is best for the investor. For this reason, the submitted work concerns investors who will comply with strict restrictions. In this way, an investment strategy for a selected group of investors can be created. The paper focuses on investors in Slovakia. The art of investment decisions to make the greatest possible return is portfolio management. The studies presented in this work are designed to explore different models and to achieve investor goals to maximise their investment and minimise risk. Investing is a systematic and long-term process where the investor gives up part of his free funds to increase their value and collect the return for them in the future. Investing is effective only if it follows certain rules. Sending a monthly deposit with iron regularity is, in the event of a recession and crisis, the only guarantee of achieving the desired future goal of investing. Mutual funds are a simple way of collective investment, where a person collects money from investors and invests in various assets such as stocks, government bonds, currencies, commodities. Profits from the investment are distributed to all investors who contributed to the fund. These funds are professionally managed by investment specialists based on their market knowledge. A share is equity security representing an equity interest in a joint-stock company. Monetary policy and financial stress significantly affect the ability of the actively managed fund's performance vis-a-vis ETFs performance. This fact must be stated as this is a limitation of the analysis in the presented paper.",

    "abstract": "International oil prices affect the development of many areas of the world economy, where most predictions of macroeconomic variables depend on the changes in oil prices.The high volatility of oil prices is a cause of prediction complexity, especially in crisis or during the current coronavirus pandemic.In this paper, a special and promising type of artificial neural network (Long Short-Term Memory) is used for predicting oil prices.The paper's objective is to predict the development of B daily values to 30 June 2021.For this purpose, available data for the period from the end of June 1988 to the end of November 2020 was used.To achieve the objective of the paper, two research questions were formulated: whether the created specific neural network is a suitable tool to smooth the time series of Brent oil prices, i.e., a suitable tool to predict the future development of the price of this commodity, and what development of oil price can be expected with regard to the current situation in global markets.It was confirmed that each of the networks retained could smooth the time series successfully, and it can make a reasonable prediction of the future Brent oil price development.This paper's primary finding is that the created neural network with integrated LSTM can be used for predicting Brent oil prices.As for the further development of oil price, the oil market will also respond to the positive development of the economy and the growth of the world economy's overall product, where both the quantity of extracted oil in the market and its price will grow.",

The identification strategy positions the structural shocks to private investment behaviour in the Dynamics Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework with a three-accuracy test estimation: The Brooks and Gelman test, the Metropolis-Hastings jumping distribution acceptance ratio, and the distribution of the deep posteriors parameters are asymptotically normal. The quarter economic data of Iran economy from July 1988 until March 2015 is applied. The findings illustrate that the structural shocks about technology have a similar impact and cause a growth in private investment, and the only difference is, in investment-specific technology shock due to a temporary decrease in the capital expenses installation (Tobin's Q), an investment boom is driven. In contrast, the price markup shock due to inflation causes a decline in all investment indices.",

    "abstract": "The carbon market can guide the optimal allocation of carbon emission reduction resources through price signals, and it can reduce the cost of emission reduction in the entire society, promote investment in green and low-carbon industries, and then guide the capital flow.Therefore, the carbon pricing mechanism has encouraged the energy transition and effectively mitigating climate change.Additionally, the primary source of carbon emissions is the rapid growth of energy use, such as coal and crude oil.Therefore, carbon pricing plays a vital role in promoting energy transitions, such as the transition from high-carbon energy (coal and oil) to lowcarbon energy (natural gas) and clean energy (nuclear and renewable resources).Our study is devoted to investigating the impact of carbon pricing on the energy industry using bibliometric analysis and visual investigation.We analyze existing research trends on the impact of carbon pricing on the energy industry from different angles and review the effect of carbon pricing on various energy industries.We search for optimal carbon pricing models and pricing policies that impact the energy industry.Our study contributes to the literature by discussing the challenges and future study recommendations.",

To further understand the research frontiers in the energy efficiency field, this paper utilizes a bibliometric analysis with the help of visualization tools: CiteSpace and VOSviewer. The relevant literature during 2010-2020 is collected with the retrieval formulas from the Web of Science Core Collection. Firstly, this paper analyzes the annual indicators, research areas, productive institutions, authors, and journals of publications to comprehend the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the energy efficiency literature. Meanwhile, this paper identifies the productive institutions and authors and the influential journals. Then, we construct the collaboration networks among countries/regions/insti tutions, references, and authors to know the collaborative relationships. By analyzing the keywords from highly cited papers with clustering, timeline view, and time zone view, the trend of changes is grasped over time in the energy efficiency literature. Finally, conclusions and some directions for future research are put forward in terms of the bibliometric analysis findings, which may make some references for researchers in the energy field.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energy can be used from several natural sources, which are capable of wind, sun, water, geothermal springs, or biomass. Energy from these sources is clean, safe and inexhaustible. The use of alternative sources is becoming part of all realistic scenarios and promotes sustainable development and energy security in Europe as well. Renewable energy sources form a relatively significant part of primary energy sources in many countries. Thanks to the undeniable advantages of their use, they form another higher share of combined energy production in Slovakia. In addition, the correct location of renewable energy sources can be a key element in the development of individual regions, which can contribute to achieving better social and economic cohesion in the country. Given these obvious environmental and economic benefits, efficient use of renewable energy sources is receiving increasing attention and support from responsible officials and the general public around the world, including Slovakia. The main goal of this paper was to evaluate the use of renewable resources in Slovakia with a focus on biogas plants. We also evaluate the position of Slovakia within the EU in this area and find out what is the current situation of biogas plants in Slovakia.",

    "abstract": "Researchers tend to develop cluster studies when the ways of turning to the circular economy are considered.Clusters are viewed as a network where different institutions, enterprises, and research centres are connected to share their knowledge and resources for better results of their performance.Efficient use of resources can be achieved in such networks through involvement in the circular economy.Clusters with their resources and knowledge as contributors in transition to a circular economy are analysed in this paper.The paper aims at literature analysis where clusters and circular economy are overviewed.The links between these two notions are traced, and the relation of clusters in transition to a circular economy is verified through the application of several multicriteria decision-making and mathematics-based information analysis methods.Scientific literature analysis works for the identification of the main concepts and definition of the object.The qualitative and quantitative analysis employs multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) methods (SAW, TOPSIS) and regression analysis.A tool that enables verification of relation between clusters and transition to the circular economy was employed using these methods.The findings suggest that the tool used in the research can be applied when the relation of clusters and transition to a circular economy is being traced.The paper suggests experts' selection through their work experience with clusters and/or circular economy and their evaluation for certain clusters in transition to a circular economy set of criteria.The zero values of some indicators were eliminated by mathematically recalculating the weights so that distortion of the results after the application of MCDM methods is avoided.The results of MCDM methods application in regression analysis show that there is a possible relationship between clusters and transition to a circular economy.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly meagre copper ore resources constitute one of the decisive factors influencing the price of this commodity. The demand for copper has been showing an accelerating trend since the Covid pandemic broke out. It is thereby imperative to estimate the future price movement of this material. The article focuses on a daily prediction of the forthcoming change in prices of copper on the commodity market. The research data were gathered from day-to-day closing historical prices of copper from commodity stock COMEX converted to a time series. The price is expressed in US Dollars per pound. The data were processed using artificial intelligence, recurrent neural networks, including the Long Short Term Memory layer. Neural networks have a great potential to predict this type of time series. The results show that the volatility in copper price during the monitored period was low or close to zero. We may thereby argue that neural networks foresee the first three months more accurately than the rest of the examined period. Neural structures anticipate copper prices from 4.5 to 4.6 USD to the end of the period in question. Low volatility that would last longer than one year would cut down speculators’ profits to a minimum (lower risk). On the other hand, this situation would bring about balance which the purchasing companies avidly seek for. However, the presented article is solely confined to a limited number of variables to work with, disregarding other decisive criteria. Although the very high performance of the experimental prediction model, there is always space for improvement – e.g. effectively combining traditional methods with advanced techniques of artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Business cycles are among the most discussed topics in social sciences. Environmental changes, heatwaves and natural disasters as consequences of anthropogenic activities are headwinds to future economic growth and development. There is an ongoing debate on environmental degradation and its socio-economic impact. Here we investigate the existence of primary energy (coal, gas, oil, nuclear, solar, thermal, wind) cycles in England from 1700 to 2018. Using turning points methodology (Harding &amp; Pagan, 2002), we isolate energy cycles and explain their phase characteristics. Offering empirical evidence of energy cycles existence should assist policymakers to gain additional quantitative knowledge to understand and contain business cycles. Fossil fuels energy cycles are closely linked to business cycles, but renewable energy cycles are pushing forward, targeting the leading role. Energy cycles are the missing link in the literature needed to understand business cycles and future economic development. In this study, we supply knowledge for understanding energy cycles and their relationship to the business cycles. The estimated concordance index reveals a systematic relationship between energy and business cycles with conclusive results. Energy cycles in this century will become a major force driving socio-economic events. Managers in the firms and policymakers on the macro-level will need knowledge on energy cycles since tracking energy cycles soon will become more important to tracking business cycles. To this end, our study contributes to the study of energy cycles as the source of business cycles.",

    "abstract": "Copper and aluminium prices have long been influenced mainly by non-renewable resources and the industry's widespread use of copper and aluminium for their desired properties. Metal commodities are irreplaceable for the industry of developed countries, and their shortage in the covid times also increases the price and consequently the price of products made from them. As copper ore stocks continue to decline, suitable substitutes should be sought. The paper discusses the potential of copper substitution by aluminium and subsequently the development of prices and production of copper and aluminium, including a prediction about the future development. Research data were obtained from Market.business insider (2021) and Investing.com (2022) converted to time series. The price is shown in US dollars per tonne and the production value in millions of tonnes. Development data were processed using artificial intelligence and recurrent neural networks, including the Long Short Term Memory layer. Neural networks, as such, have great potential to predict these types of time series. The annual copper and aluminium production data were processed using a regression function. Neural networks could not be used due to the smaller data range. The results show that the 1NN30L neural network with an LSTM layer and considered a 30-day delay is the most suitable network for forecasting future copper prices, and the 3NN30L neural network with an LSTM layer and considered a 30-day delay is the most suitable network for forecasting future aluminium prices. The forecast has confirmed that the price of copper will fall at the end of 2021, and the trend will be constant in the next planned period. Aluminium will also fall sharply at the end of 2021; at the beginning of 2022, the price level is predicted to rise to that of 30 October 2021, and thereinafter the trend will be almost constant. Research has confirmed that copper and aluminium may be imperfect substitutes in some respect, but they can generally be considered complementary. Copper mining has stabilised in recent years, but aluminium production has increased significantly in the last decade, and it can be expected to grow in the near future.",

The ammonium thiosulphate based leaching of gold and silver from PCBs waste, using crushing as a pretreatment, was investigated. It was possible to achieve 98 % gold and 93 % silver recovery within 48 hours of ammonium thiosulphate leaching. This type of leaching is a better leaching procedure for recovery of gold and silver from PCB waste than the classical toxic cyanide leaching. 84 % Cu, 82 % Fe, 77 % Al, 76 % Zn, 70 % Ni, 90 % Pd, 88 % Pb and 83 % Sn recovery of the accompanying metals was achieved, using sulphuric acid with hydrogen peroxide, sodium chloride and aqua regia.

    "abstract": "Mathematical modelling of rock mass breaking using blasting has been applied to obtain formulas for the calculation of crush zone radii, intensive fragmentation, and crack formation around the charging cavity in the structure, diameter of the charging cavity, diameter of the charge itself, detonation characteristics of an explosive, boundaries of the rock strength, rock mass jointing, and mineral compression under the effect of rock pressure. The methods have been developed to calculate parameters of drilling and blasting operations (DBOs) while driving the mine workings based upon the idea of the arrangement of blastholes in terms of areas they occupy in a fore-breast as well as upon their location relative to break-off outline. Stage one of the methods involves calculating and designing burn cuts where a distance between blastholes is determined with the help of a fragmentation zone radius. Stage two means calculation of both specific and total explosion consumption per borehole bottom, line of least resistance (LLR) for a borehole in terms of intensive fragmentation, areas of borehole groups, borehole number, analytical and actual distance between boreholes, actual charge amount per borehole, and actual specific and the total explosive (E) consumption per borehole bottom. The methods have been tested in the operating ore mine while driving a mine working. Emulsion explosive (EE) Ukrayinit-PP-2 (Україніт-ПП-2) has been applied. The developed methods have been used to calculate DBOs parameters for the explosive. Trial blasts demonstrated the good firing of a borehole bottom and uniform ore fragmentation; a high coefficient of borehole use has been supported.",

    "abstract": "The article discusses the experience of reaching longwall's record coal production levels at the mine named after V. D. Yalevsky in the Kuznetsk Basin (Russia).The features of the geological and mining conditions at the mine being discussed.Several aspects and parameters were analyzed in the course of the study, including the technological solutions that made it possible to reach high production levels when mining multiple coal seams that demonstrate spontaneous combustion propensity, the methane emission control and ground control methods used at the mine, and changes in the output rate and methane emissions from the panel being mined.It is demonstrated that it is possible to increase the output rate for longwall up to 1.5 million tonnes per month when mining thick coal seams with methane contents that do not exceed 7 m 3 /t.With an increase in methane contents up to 10 m 3 /t, the output rate has to be slowed down due to the limited methane control capabilities.It is shown that preliminary degasification is required, with relevant options being proposed.The article also discusses the necessity of conducting development operations in a timely manner when coal output rates are high, and solutions are proposed as to how it can be achieved.In the course of the study, it was found out that longwall move operations at the Yalevsky mine could be improved.As a result, measures were developed, such as selecting the best location for the recovery room, and other recommendations were given to make longwall move operations more efficient.Numerical simulations were made to analyze the methane emission process at the longwall panel, the results of which made it possible to develop recommendations for adjusting the degasification parameters and changing the distance between ventilation crosscuts to improve methane control at the longwall panels.Also, recommendations were given to achieve the highest coal production levels possible.",

    "abstract": "In the present study the new “casing-friendly” hardbanding alloy based on high-manganese steel reinforced with complex carbide particles was developed by combining thermodynamic modelling within the CALPHAD approach and first-principles calculations. The alloy, deposited by flux cored arc welding on a steel substrate, has a composite structure consisting of manganese-austenite with the ability to work hardening, fine (up to 5 µm) inclusions of the multicomponent carbide (Nb, Ti, Mo, V) and C the thin layers of (Mo,V)C at the austenite grain boundaries. The comparative wear tests carried out with commercially available hardfacing materials of the Fe-W-C and Fe-Cr-C systems showed that the proposed alloy has the best combination of properties preventing the wear of the drill casing, while its abrasion resistance as well as wear resistance in sliding friction conditions by steel counterbody is close to hypereutectic high chromium alloys. The microhardness tests performed on deformed specimen areas after the friction tests show the presence of a significant hardness gradient in the range of 800-450 HV at a distance of about 300 µm when moving perpendicularly away from the zone of friction contact. During the microscopic observation of the layer deposited with the developed alloy and the interfaces between the deposit and the base steel no cracks, pores delamination were detected indicating a strong metallurgical bonding. The hardbanding process was performed for drill pipe joints with the worn Fe-based high chromium alloy hardbanding after exploitation, which allows the drill pipe to be reused with the same durability.",

    "abstract": "Safety, development, and efficiency are the main slogans that guide modern mines. At the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, they are familiar with innovations and modern technologies that allow them to create innovative solutions and build an environmentally friendly mining sector. The aim of the paper was to assess the feasibility of implementing the assumptions of the industrial revolution 4.0 in the mining industry. Based on the author's own research and literature research, a set of scenarios for the transformation process was developed. After the verification, three alternative scenarios related to the transformation process 4.0 in mines were used for the research. The transformation scenarios were assessed from the perspective of individual stakeholder groups. The NAIADE (Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments), which so far has not been used in the mining industry to assess development scenarios, the method was used to assess the transformation scenarios. The research identified and characterized nine groups of stakeholders. Based on the conducted structured interviews, a set of technical criteria for the assessment of scenarios was defined. The analysis results from the impact matrix and social impact matrix developed for the first time for the mining industry transformation scenarios. Based on the analysis of the impacts of individual factors, it was shown which scenario is the most acceptable for stakeholders and the best from a technical point of view. The research focuses on the deficit of digital competencies and the generational change, as well as the change in the competency requirements of the new type of worker-miner-operator 4.0.",

    "abstract": "Households are responsible for almost 30% of final energy consumption in the EU. Therefore, sustainable energy consumption in households can provide a lot of benefits for energy savings, use of renewables and GHG emission reduction. Environmental awareness plays an important role in promoting sustainable energy consumption in households, fostering low carbon energy transition, and creating a carbon-neutral society in the EU by 2050. Though the use of renewables and energy efficiency improvements in households are increasing in the EU, the low environmental awareness about the benefits of sustainable energy consumption, especially in vulnerable households receiving state support, might be an important barrier to creating a carbon-neutral society in the EU. The paper analyses the main scientific literature showing the linkages between environmental awareness and sustainable energy consumption in households and presents the results of an empirical study conducted in Lithuanian households. The study identified the main barriers to sustainable energy consumption in households and assessed state policies targeting sustainable energy consumption in households.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) become widespread in several real-time applications. Since IoT devices have generated a huge amount of data, the processing of data at the cloud server leads to high delay. To reduce the delay, fog-assisted WSN can be developed where the Fog Nodes are kept at the edge of the network nearer to the client. Besides, security becomes a challenging issue in fog-assisted WSN and can be accomplished by using Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This paper presents an Oppositional Coyote Optimization based feature selection with Cat Swarm Optimization based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (OCOA-CSBiGRU) for intrusion detection in fog-assisted WSN. The intention of the OCOA-CSBiGRU technique is to identify the occurrence of intrusions in the fog-assisted WSN by the use of feature selection and classification models. The proposed OCOA-CSBiGRU technique initially designs a novel OCOA-based feature selection technique for the optimal selection of features. Besides, the BiGRU model is utilized for the detection and classification of intrusions. In order to improve the detection efficiency of the BiGRU model, the Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) algorithm has been utilized. A comprehensive experimental analysis is carried out on benchmark datasets, and the results indicatebetter outcomes of the OCOA-CSBiGRU technique over the recent methods interms of different metrics.",

    "abstract": "The current study is related to the empirical gap on the relation between personality traits and counterproductive behavior, which is especially important for literature concerning Central and Eastern post-transformation economies. Therefore, the main empirical goal of the article is to determine how the personality traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness to experience) influence the extent of organizational and interpersonal counterproductive work behaviors (CWB; CWB-O; CWB-I) and how this relation is moderated by the demographic and professional characteristics of employees (sex, age, seniority or type of work). The research objectives were met using a survey conducted in April 2020 among 454 professionally active people in Poland. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the empirical data. The proposed theoretical model was intended to determine how particular types of personality impact CWB. Based on the empirical results, we determined that personality traits strongly affect counterproductive work behaviors. The strongest predictors of organizational CWB proved to be Conscientiousness (negative relation) and Agreeableness (positive relation). There was no direct effect of personality traits on CWB-I. Moreover, the relationship between personality traits and CWB-O/I was significantly moderated by the demographic and professional characteristics of employees (sex, age, seniority, or type of work). The discussed result is reached based only on Polish employees' sample, which can be considered its important limitation. However, it still contributes significantly to international behavioral economics literature in the field. Due to many institutional characteristics and similar social context, the conclusions can be generalized and attributed at least for other Central European economies which are at the same level of development and which are characterized by many social and cultural similarities. From the practical perspective, the obtained results can be of special importance for human resource management in the reality of Industry 4.0 challenges.",

    "abstract": "Filtering vegetation in point clouds is one of the basic steps in processing the products of bulk data collection.Commonly used filtering methods have been developed for large areas, usually scanned from an aircraft at high altitude, where the point clouds are very poorly detailed, and the terrain is essentially flat.Nowadays, point clouds are generated not only by aerial and ground scanning but mainly by photogrammetry from UAVs and, more recently, by scanners mounted on UAVs.Various objects are measured, including anthropogenic objects, rugged areas with large elevations, rocks, pits, buildings, etc.Therefore, the aim of filtering is no longer to remove everything from the cloud except the ground surface but to remove vegetation as such and some unnecessary objects.In this task, the use of structure filters, which classify points based on the surrounding of each point in terms of its structure, seems to be advantageous.Since many different filtering algorithms have been developed and their behaviour is controlled by the parameters chosen, it is necessary to test suitable filters and their settings for each type of area.In this paper, selected freely available filtering methods based on a geometric approach are tested as a comparison to the CANUPO-based structure filter, which is the main object.Testing of ground filtering procedures on real data acquired by the UAV 3D scanner DJI L1 corresponding to the nature of the mining area was performed.Test results were evaluated by type I error, type II error, and total error, where type I error represents incorrectly unremoved points, type II error represents incorrectly removed points, and total error represents the sum of type I error and type II error.The tested geometric filters CSF, PMF and SMRF showed an overall error of about 7.5% in the best case, of which error type I constitutes a significantly larger part (about 6%) than error type II (about 2%).In contrast, the tested CANUPO structural filter in basic use achieved up to 5.2% total error, using a defined probability bound of up to 4.1%.The distribution of errors of type I and type II is almost even here.The specific probability set here has a relatively small effect on the result, at 0.1% of the total error.Some additional insights into the design and use of filters emerged from the testing.Geometric filters are significantly faster, but CANUPO is significantly more reliable in terms of removing vegetation as points having a character of noise.In particular, the maximum radius used and the total number of filters must be considered when creating a filtering (training) prescription.",

    "abstract": "Slewing bearings are one of the most important elements in the vast majority of large-size machines. They are widely used in the mining industry: tunnel cutters, bucket excavators and many other devices. In a Bucket-wheel excavator, continuous rotation of the body is most advantageous due to the technique of digging the input or coal. The rotational movement of the machine is then the basic cutting movement, and the delivery movement, carried out by driving the machine, is only an auxiliary movement. A similar kinematics occurs in tunnel cutters. Therefore, these bearings have played such a significant role and have been the subject of extensive research and continuous improvement over the years. High demands are placed on them in terms of load capacity, friction, accuracy, durability and reliability. It happens, however, that despite careful design and manufacture, the bearings do not achieve the required durability. Failures usually result in economic losses due to loss of production, damage to adjacent parts and repair costs. Premature bearing failure can occur for a variety of reasons. Each failure leaves its own special mark on the bearing. Consequently, by examining the damaged bearing, it is in most cases possible to find the root cause and define corrective actions, thus preventing further failures. This publication aims to provide basic knowledge about the factors determining the load capacity and durability of large-size slewing ring bearings and the analysis of their damage. The result of the considerations is finding the sources of errors in determining the load-bearing capacity characteristics of roller slewing bearings. For this purpose, the ISHIKAWA and FMEA methods were used and the risk level for errors was determined. Moreover, the article presents some forms of damage to raceways of slewing bearings and indicates their causes. Changes in the so-called angle of action of the rolling elements in the ball bearing due to the transferred loads. The influence of changes in this angle on the geometry of the contact zone of the rolling elements and raceways was investigated. It has been shown that the contact angles of some rolling elements increase significantly. This can damage the raceway by chipping or rolling the edge of the bearing ring. With the knowledge presented in this article, it is possible to evaluate various emergency situations and start their proper analysis.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) reduced the data dimensionality from 18 original physico-chemical and microbiological parameters determined in drinking water samples to 6 principal components explaining about 83 % of the data variability. These 6 components represented inorganic salts, nitrate/pH, iron, chlorine, nitrite/ammonium traces, and heterotrophic bacteria. Using the PCA scatter plot and the Ward's clustering of the samples characterized by the first and second principal components, three clusters were revealed. These clusters sorted drinking water samples according to their origin ground and surface water. The PCA results were confirmed by the factor analysis and hierarchical clustering of the original data.",

    "abstract": "The property market has experienced a sharp increase in prices recently, which indicates a different nature of the Covid 19 downturn of the economy compared with usual economic crises. This paper identifies key features of the property market which may help understand why the property market performs differently from other markets. A number of factors play an important role in shaping real estate prices, some of which can and cannot be influenced. The quality of the environment is often one of the main important factors, which is also presented by air pollution values. Apart from transport, waste incineration and thermal power plants, the most common causes of air pollution include the mining industry's activities. We aim to explain why property prices do not converge across regions, but prices in expensive regions experience an even stronger price dynamics, a recent phenomenon. We argue that the price dynamics have been predominantly demand-driven in a market with an unelastic and lacking supply of new properties. The real estate market was also significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of individual states. It has been found that money, which has been invested on a large scale in all sectors of the economy in order to limit the negative effects of pandemic measures, has often found its way to investing in assets of all kinds. As a result, real estate prices are rising sharply, especially in richer areas with minimal unemployment. This article aims to offer a deeper insight into the relationship between flats/house prices and variables that proved to be significantly correlated to prices in regional decomposition. Finally, we suggest ways for sustainable future development of the property market.",

The primary goal is to achieve a climate-neutral in Europe by 2050. Technologies with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions should be completely stopped in the future. The iron and steel industry is among the manufacturing industries with high CO2 emissions in Europe. In Poland, steel mills produce about 9 million tonnes of steel per year (average for 2000-2021). Steel mills in Poland use two steel production technologies, EAF and BOF. The first technology is highly energy intensive, and the second has high emissions of CO2. There will be no BF technology in zero-emission smelters; this technology will be replaced by DRI (i.e., direct iron reduction) installations, and electric furnaces will be powered by renewable energy. The paper consists of two parts: a theoretical section and a practical section. In the first section, the way the steel industry moves towards climate neutrality was presented. The part of the paper was realized based on European documents and a literature review. The second part was an analysis of the CO2 emission in the steel industry in Poland.

    "abstract": "Although the concept of the circular economy as a term was first mentioned in 2015, when the \"Action Plan for the circular economy\" was adopted at the European level, it is still not possible to speak of a sufficient knowledge base in this area. The Action Plan (COM (2015) 614) can be seen as an initial strategic document that sets out a concrete and ambitious roadmap for implementing the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. However, the European Green Agreement cannot be left out in this context either (COM(2019) 640). It is seen as a new growth strategy to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society with a modern, competitive, resource-efficient economy, with net greenhouse gas emissions expected to be zero by 2050 and economic growth independent of resource use. A new EU circular economy action plan - Towards a cleaner and more competitive Europe was also adopted in 2020 (COM(2020) 98). The main priority areas are measures focusing on the value chains of key products electronics and ICT (information and communication technologies), batteries and vehicles, plastics, textiles, packaging, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients measures covering all links in the value chain from production to consumption, repair and refurbishment, waste management up to the return of raw materials back to the economy and their use in the production cycle in the form of secondary raw materials. The transition to a circular economy also includes a revision of the European waste directives: on waste, on packaging and packaging waste, on landfills, on batteries and accumulators and used batteries and accumulators, and on waste electrical and electronic equipment. In order for all of this to be possible, it is necessary to know the amount of waste produced by individual sectors, which is also dealt with in our article.",

    "abstract": "Investing in renewable energy sources bringing direct profits from unattractive areas is one of the most advantageous ways of wastelands revitalization. In the case of post-mining dumps, it is realized by using photovoltaics and wind turbines. Analyzes showed that the greatest benefits can be acquired from photovoltaic farms, mainly due to the simplicity of their design and principles of operation, as well as the quick return on investment - up to 7 years. The construction of wind turbines is more complicated. Despite the favorable conditions of the mining dumps (elevated areas, which are located mainly away from residential buildings), the construction of the turbine requires more effort in designing and installation work, mainly due to the necessity of building the foundations. Methods for revitalizing mine dumps by installing renewable energy systems have some limitations due to periodicity of operation (time of day, season), weather conditions (wind speed, temperature), expensive energy storage, etc. For this reason, real-time monitoring of climatic conditions is required. The following parameters are monitored: the average available solar energy (important for the assessment of the efficiency of photovoltaic cells), speed and direction of the wind (which affects the efficiency of wind turbines), changes in groundwater level (risk of flooding and periodic soil softening), soil and air temperature (air – affects the choice of the method of revitalization, soil – affects the preservation of soil) and dust concentration, which affects the degree of contamination of the photovoltaic modules and thus the efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) power plant. The presentation includes interesting data that was obtained during the tests.",

These disturbances lead to the vulnerability of inhabitants and habitat and climate changes and socio-economic development in the region. Several studies have proposed different methods and techniques to monitor the spatial and temporal changes of LULC. Machine learning is a more popular method. However, the problem of data imbalance is a significant challenge, and the classification results tend to bias the majority classes for unbalanced data. Therefore, this study's objective is to develop a state-of-the-art technique to reduce the problem of data imbalance in LULC classification in Vietnam based on machine learning and SMOTE (Synthesizing Minority Oversampling Technology) with Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN). Various statistical indices, including Kappa and Accuracy, have been used to assess the performance for the classification of Land-use/cover. The results indicate that integrating oversampling and under-sampling with SMOTE ENN gave better overall accuracy and generalization. We also find that the expected proportion of chance agreement after oversampling is higher than before (Kappa score before and after oversampling is 0.905244 and 0.974379, respectively). This study provides an effective method to monitor spatial and temporal land cover change in Vietnam; it plays a role as a framework for other relevant research related to land cover change, which can support planning and sustainable management of the territory.",

    "abstract": "Due to operating in the mining and iron sectors with fierce competition and encountering more financial obstacles compared to larger enterprises, SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) become more likely to face business failures, have lower financial performance and have high financial risk. To overcome those financial impediments and become more competitive against their rivals, social media usage might be a solution. This is because even under the conditions of the covid-19 pandemic, social media has also stimulated online purchasing behaviours of customers and has been used as an effective tool by SMEs for marketing purposes. However, SMEs' usage of these channels might differ depending on the countries where they are located, so their impacts on financial obstacles might be different. In this regard, this research examines whether the impacts of social media usage on the financial problems of SMEs differ depending on their location. To achieve this goal, the researchers employ an online survey and direct it to the executives of 1156 Czech, Slovakian and Hungarian SMEs. The researchers apply Ordinal Logistic Regression with the Logit function in SPSS statistical tool for analyzing purposes. The results confirm the fact that while differences do not exist among countries regarding the impact of social media usage on business failures, the effects of social media usage on financial performance and financial risk differ between Hungarian and Czech-Slovakian SMEs. Czech and Slovakian SMEs show similar attitudes in all of the analyzed variables.",

It covers the most important challenges faced by underground coal mining companies and discusses growth areas in mining technology that are aligned with the paradigm of sustainable development. Using the example of underground coal mining operations, it illustrates such concepts as the intelligent mine and the invisible mine, discussing how they can be brought to life. It also shows how underground coal mining companies can improve their productivity, OSH management, and environmental indicators to make their products competitive. As mining operations are becoming more intensive and the average depth of mining is growing, which is accompanied by an increase in both methane emissions and risks associated with rock mechanics processes, it is becoming vital to accurately predict how the rock mass will behave and, by applying stress-strain analysis, to identify hazardous zones and their boundaries. The article discusses several mine layouts and how their parameters are adjusted to ensure intensive mining. Among the factors that hinder growth in coal production, it highlights the underutilisation of high-performance mining equipment.

    "abstract": "The usage of marketing communication tools has always been a potent strategy for businesses to increase their performances and profitability in all sectors, including the mining industry.However, there is a lack of studies concerning the usage of those channels and their impacts on the innovativeness of functional areas of businesses.Since innovativeness is a crucial ability for enterprises to survive, focusing on this competency in functional areas businesses might fulfill this research gap.In this regard, this paper purposes of examining the influences of the usage of marketing communication tools on innovations of those areas of businesses.In line with this purpose, the researchers have created an online interned mediated questionnaire and directed it to the randomly selected 812 SMEs from Slovakia.To explore the effects of those tools on functional areas of businesses, the researchers employ the Ordinal Logistic Regression Test.The results from the analyses vindicate the fact that when SMEs apply traditional and technologyenabled marketing communication tools, they become more innovative in some activities, namely, marketing, logistics, finance, human resources, processes, and management, except suppliercustomer relationships.While traditional marketing communication tools positively impact businesses' innovations regarding a suppliercustomer relationship, the usage of technology-enabled marketing communication tools does not create significant effects on innovations in this relationship.The reason for that might be related to the location of SMEs, the regional income gap in countries, workload and competencies of workers and the Covid-19 pandemic.The research also presents some policy implications to cope with the negative outcomes of the above-mentioned reasons.This issue is of great importance also for companies operating in the mining industry.Thus, the findings represent a valuable platform of knowledge for various business areas, such as mining.",

    "abstract": "Spatial planning is a set of managerial activities focused on a given territory's balanced and sustainable development and territorial subjects. It is obvious that planning in general, and especially the role of the planners, has been lately substantially modified – they shifted their societal positions from regulators and designers of our future toward the facilitators of versatile and multidimensional processes of spatial development. In this process, variables and phenomena like community, identity, place, social behaviour or human values play a significant role more than ever. Planning has overreached its normative essence and is by now a multidimensional participatory process reflecting the cultural background of the society. The unique character of any given planning culture is determined by the value system, which is mediated by and mirrored in the acting, communication, and leadership patterns. Understanding cultural dynamics and developing a clear vision of the desired planning culture based on democratic leadership and its active fostering should be essential competencies of any planner. Recent societal developments (fragmentation of the society, negative demographic change, endangered social cohesion) highlighted the need for special attention dedicated to these issues. It has been confirmed that highly profiled planning cultures based on active leadership generating a typical set of principles, values and approaches are arguably as important for any territory's balanced and sustainable development as a wide array of normative and formal instruments. A productive planning culture based on democratic decision-making and effective leadership is becoming a vital part of regional competitiveness – the ability of the city, region, or whole state to be successful in different competitions and interactions with other subjects or partners. Our contribution is to analyze the main scope of planning culture and its role in increasing regional or territorial competitiveness, and it concentrates on special traits of Central European planning culture in this regard.",

    "abstract": "Many previous studies have addressed the relationship between sustainability and digitalization. However, the impact of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which mandates extensive data disclosure, on corporate digitalization remains underexplored. This paper examines whether the CSRD acts as a driver of digitalization through correlation analysis and multivariate regression on a sample of Czech energy sector companies likely to fall under the CSRD in 2025. Due to the chosen selection criteria, the sample also includes companies with ties to the energy sector, such as representatives from the metallurgical and mining industries. Sustainability is represented by the quality of non-financial information (NFI) disclosed, assessed through the lens of the CSRD, while the level of digitalization is assessed through digitization indexes constructed based on the textual analysis of the annual reports and the asset-based approach. The findings show a weak but positive correlation between the quality of NFI and the level of digitalization, although this correlation is not statistically significant, which does not fully support previous researchers' findings. Thus, the methodological limitations are discussed in detail, and further research is recommended. Alternative methods of assessment of the level of digitalization, such as questionnaire surveys, can help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the sustainability-digitalization nexus. The theoretical contribution of this paper lies in offering a new perspective on methods for evaluating digitalization levels and linking digitalization progress to CSR development within the EU context. Practically, this paper highlights the relationship between digitalization and CSRD, providing valuable insights for companies and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "The mining, metallurgical, and energy sectors are among the most significant branches of Ukraine’s economy, contributing substantially to national GDP and employment. However, these sectors are also major sources of environmental pollution, particularly through the generation of substantial volumes of liquid industrial waste. A notable portion of this waste includes fine-dispersed coal sludge from coke-chemical production, which poses serious risks to ecosystems and public health if not properly managed. This research addresses the urgent need for effective processing of such waste, demonstrating the feasibility and economic viability of obtaining marketable secondary products through advanced fine classification methods in the 0.05–0.1 mm fraction range, combined with simultaneous dewatering techniques. By implementing these technologies, it is possible to significantly reduce the accumulation of hazardous waste in storage facilities, thereby minimizing environmental damage and the associated long-term remediation costs. This approach contributes to the circular economy by recovering valuable resources from waste streams, thus enhancing the overall profitability and sustainability of industrial operations. The study underscores the importance of integrating low-waste technologies, efficient raw material utilization, and cross-sectoral cooperation to develop a modern system of waste management. Such integration ensures not only the minimization of environmental harm but also supports Ukraine’s transition towards more sustainable industrial practices and compliance with European environmental standards. The proposed solutions offer a practical pathway to achieving both ecological and economic resilience in the context of post-war recovery and industrial modernization.",

Therefore, the article's authors decided to examine the issue in full. This article deals with a study of the determinants of economic growth in the countries of the top ten oil and gas producers. This study uses panel data analysis and is a direct fixed-effects model. Two models are built, one for oil and one for natural gas. The period under study is the same for both models, between 1980 and 2021. The exchange rate, HDI, crude oil production, crude oil price, and oil consumption significantly positively affect GDP growth. Population growth, HDI, natural gas production, and the natural gas price have a significant positive effect on GDP growth.",

    "abstract": "The shift in scientific and technological progress expectations from human-centric development (Industry 5.0) to achieving socially significant environ-mental, primarily climate, goals (Industry 6.0) requires ensuring a \"seamless\" Fourth Energy Transition – without restrictions on the access of all countries of the world to cheap energy, with a characteristic consistent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and adherence to the climate agenda. Today, scien-tists have experience in studying the digital technologies of Industry 4.0 and forecasting their development to the level of 6.0. However, less attention is paid to the prospects for the formation of their Energy 6.0 platform. In this regard, the purpose of this Review is to accumulate the experience of research on Industry 6.0 for transfer to the energy sector based on the existing re-search groundwork for Energy 6.0. In this regard, the purpose of this Review is to analyze the content and structure of publications in the field of Energy 6.0. The main result of the research is a comprehensive overview of research papers in the field of Industry 5.0 digital technologies' evolution from the characteristic human-centricity to the nature-centricity inherent in Industry 6.0. Energy 6.0 is defined as an environmentally oriented technological plat-form for the energy sector in the second half of the 21st century, based on the expansion of digital technologies (emotional artificial intelligence, the Internet of Everything, digital triples and hyper-connected enterprises, predictive multi-industry analytics of Big Data and their quantum processing, computa-tional experiments and virtualized assembly) in basic industries. The most promising areas of future research on Energy 6.0 are identified. These are the roles of Industry 6.0 technologies in a seamless Fourth Energy Transition: overcoming inequality in access to renewable energy among different coun-tries, balancing the achievement of energy and climate goals for sustainable development, and further development of digital technologies beyond cyber-physical systems. They also include an analysis of Energy 6.0 place in the system of transition to Industry 6.0, as well as its consideration as a structural shift in the economy. The Review concludes that further research on Energy 6.0, focusing on digital technologies that accelerate the balance between achieving energy and climate Goals of Sustainable Development, the move-ment towards a \"seamless\" Fourth Energy Transition, and ESG investments, is relevant and significant for both theory and practice.",

    "abstract": "The extraction of hard coal has significant adverse effects on the natural environment, which mining entities disclose in their non-financial reports in compliance with increasingly stringent legal regulations. Regular stakeholder communication, encompassing comprehensive information on a company's economic, social, and environmental activities, enhances corporate transparency, facilitates the assessment of strategic implementation, and supports the identification of future risks. The objective of this article is to assess the impact of formal and legal conditions on ESG reporting within the environmental disclosure domain by the largest capital groups in Poland's hard coal mining sector over the period 2017–2024, with a particular focus on the role of taxonomy reports. The study employs an in-depth qualitative comparative analysis of data contained in the Management Board's activity reports and the consolidated financial statements of the three largest capital groups in the hard coal mining sector: the Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa (JSW) Group, the Lubelski Węgiel Bogdanka S.A. (LWB) Group, and the Polska Grupa Górnicza S.A. (PGG). The comparative findings of these three capital groups – two of which are publicly listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) and one that remains privately held and subject to the Polish Accounting Act – revealed significant differences in the scope of environmental disclosures within the ESG framework. The primary reason for these differences lies in the varying ESG reporting regulations applicable to publicly traded groups. The study's results indicate that due to the classification of their operations as non-sustainable under the EU Taxonomy, the ESG indicators reported by the publicly listed companies are notably low, as coal extraction and sales are not considered sustainable activities. However, a detailed analysis of the companies' activity reports highlights substantial engagement in pro-environmental initiatives, reflected in expenditures, costs, and investments related to environmental protection. The study's findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the specific characteristics of the hard coal mining sector in the context of ESG reporting, offering insights into the implications of regulatory frameworks on corporate disclosure practices.",

    "abstract": "Earth's hydrological cycle, consisting of the atmosphere, plant cover, unsaturated zone and groundwater, allows the continual exchange of substances and energy through physical, chemical and biological processes. Weather extremes (floods, droughts, tornadoes) and the effect of global warming reflected in the ocean level and the increased occurrence of forest fires lead to the study of local relationships to introduce adaptation measures specifically to water sources and biodiversity management. The selected territory focused on specific model objects requires deep knowledge of its geographical and geophysical characteristics, including (micro)climatic conditions. The precise origin of (micro)climate change or its consequences, such as chemical parameter variations or water amount fluctuations, have not been fully described. Geo-engineered proposals for potential Earth temperature management are on theoretical recommendations. Therefore, this terrain physicochemical work describes interactions between water source parameters and locally specified meteorological conditions (water depth, water temperature, wind speed, air temperature and air moisture).

Spectrophotometric qualitative and quantitative analysis in the visible and ultraviolet electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths allowed chemical parameters: iron, sulphates, phosphates, nitrates, and calcium analysis. Measurable and regular monitoring of chemical and meteorological components can be an effective tool for the implementation of direct measures to protect biodiversity, agriculture, and economics. In addition, suggested research can contribute to predicting potential life self-organization in various water sources that are important in hydrological, cosmic, and planetary sciences.",

    "abstract": "Construction activity is considered to be one of the main negative environmental burdens. This is largely due to the equipment used in this activity, particularly complex heavy machinery. Hence, the aim was to analyse the main environmental burdens occurring in the phase of extraction and processing of materials for complex heavy equipment used in construction. The main burdens determining the emission of carbon footprint (CO2), land occupation, and consumption of material resources were identified. Analyses were carried out using the OpenLCA program with the Ecoinvent 3.10 database. The results showed that the main burdens concern, for instance, the production of pig iron or sintered iron. Directing pro-environmental activities to reduce the identified burdens can contribute to a significant reduction of the negative impact of heavy construction equipment in their life cycle. This procedure is beneficial within the framework of activities for the sustainable development of construction.",

Thus, various investigations have been conducted, considering different social, political, and economic factors to lessen environmental degradation and improve biocapacity. Within this context, Türkiye is one of the most essential cases because of its location and role in the global supply chain, emerging countries' members, and the severity of the environmental situation. Thus, the study employs the Fourier ARDL, FADL co-integration tests, FMOLS estimations with Fourier Terms, and Fourier Toda-Yamamoto analysis to investigate the role of economic growth and FDI in ecological footprint and the load capacity factor along with considering some control variables over the period between 1982 to 2021. As a result of the investigations, it is concluded that the economic growth, the FDI, and the remaining variables do not promote impact the load capacity factor. However, the considered variables pressure the environment when the ecological footprint is regarded as the environmental indicator, and the pollution haven hypothesis holds for Türkiye. To reverse and mitigate the harmful effects of economic activities, efforts, and policies should be made toward environmentally friendly forms of production, trade, FDI, and renewable energy sources.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the rapid development of photovoltaic (PV) energy production in Poland, highlighting its growing importance in the country's energy transition and its efforts to meet EU climate and energy targets. Over the past two decades, Poland has undergone a significant transition from reliance on fossil fuels, such as coal, to the use of renewable energy sources, with photovoltaic (PV) energy becoming one of the most dynamic and transformative sources. The study identifies the key drivers of this growth, including a favorable regulatory framework, technological advances in photovoltaic systems, and financial incentives such as the \"My Current\" program, which has significantly accelerated the deployment of home solar installations. In addition to analyzing the historical growth of the sector, the study examines the structural and systemic challenges that will hinder further PV expansion, including limited grid infrastructure capacity, the need for more efficient energy storage solutions, and regulatory complexities that impede large-scale deployment. The article also compares the development of PV in Poland with leading European countries in the field, such as Germany, Spain, and Italy, as well as with Central and Eastern European countries, such as Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, offering valuable insight into Poland's position in the European renewable energy sector and its future prospects. The results presented in the article not only illustrate the remarkable growth of photovoltaic capacity in Poland over the past two decades but also shed light on challenges such as grid infrastructure constraints, regulatory barriers, and the need for investment in energy storage.",

    "abstract": "This research focuses on the price linkages of silver and palladium and the efficiency of the ARIMA and Prophet models in the forecast of price movements. As these two valuable metals are increasingly used in major industries, an understanding of their price mechanism is very relevant for investors, analysts, and policymakers. It thus analyzes the short-run and long-run linkages between the prices of silver and palladium to identify to what extent these two metals share the same price patterns. We have used the historical price series to analyze this correlation over varying time horizons, and despite both metals recording some common price patterns, their relationship really fluctuates heavily in the near term due to market speculation, industrial demand, and various geopolitical events, while long-term correlations are more stable at the influence of broader economic and industrial trends. Besides, the study gauges the predictive performance of two widely used forecasting models: ARIMA and Prophet. An ARIMA model is a classical time series forecasting technique applied for modeling and predicting linear trends in price data. A Prophet model, which is more flexible and developed by Facebook, is assessed for handling seasonality, outliers, and missing data. The results indicated that ARIMA is relatively good at predictions in stable market conditions but can't work well during volatile periods. In contrast, Prophet has a better forecast capability in capturing both the short-run fluctuations and the long-run trends. This study therefore concludes that price correlation analysis coupled with advanced predictive modeling will lead to an improvement in forecasting accuracy and hence better decision-making in both silver and palladium markets.",

In the context of intensive diffusion processes between economic, environmental, and social problems, the most rational option is the transition to renewable energy sources (RES). One of the most promising trends is the development of the geothermal sector, given its inexhaustibility, cost-effectiveness, and lack of direct dependence on seasonal fluctuations. As part of the study, information on current energy-renewable trends was analyzed and summarized; the current state of the energy system in Ukraine and its prospects under conditions of the geothermal sector' active development were highlighted; the global regulatory sectoral differences were traced and the ways of leveling the existing contrasts with the national system were suggested; the conceptual models were created regarding the most significant risks and threats to the implementation of geothermal projects in Ukraine; the current economic indicators of geothermal facilities in three different promising regions of Ukraine were assessed and the level of feasibility of implementing operations at each of them was determined. The results of economic assessments proved the perspectiveness of all studied objects.

    "abstract": "Crystalline osmium represents a new addition to the spectrum of physical precious metal investments. As the densest stable element in the periodic table, it was not used commercially for a long time due to the assumed toxicity of its oxide (osmium tetroxide). Only the technological development of controlled crystallization processes since the 2010s made it possible to process and standardize this precious metal safely. This study examines the material science properties, toxicological safety, and economic relevance of crystalline osmium in comparison to classic precious metals such as gold, silver, or platinum. The analysis focuses on the chemical inertness and abrasion resistance of crystalline osmium structures as well as their complete inability to oxidize to osO₄ under normal environmental conditions. These properties have been confirmed by long-term stability tests, thermogravimetric tests, and independent testing institutes. The evaluation is complemented by a systematic market analysis: Despite limited production volumes and low market liquidity, crystalline osmium offers a unique profile as a long-term tangible asset and the jewelry industry due to its certified distinctiveness, high-value density, and stable storability. The paper argues that crystalline osmium - due to its scientifically proven harmlessness and its clear, unique selling point in the precious metals sector - forms an asset class in its own right. It is particularly suitable for highly diversified portfolios of physical real assets and, at the same time, represents a scientifically and regulatory secure precious metal investment.",

Given the historical and economic links of this region with the development of the mining sector, the study aims to assess how fluctuations in raw material prices (e.g., coal, copper, steel) affect housing price dynamics and real estate investment decisions. The analysis uses Eurostat and World Bank data on key raw material prices, house price indices, and real estate investment flows. Panel regression analysis was used to identify the relationship between raw material price changes and housing prices, and the ARIMA model was used to forecast the impact of raw material prices on housing market trends. The study results show that the mining sector remains important for the real estate market of the Visegrad countries, and raw material price fluctuations have a significant impact on both residential real estate prices and investment flows to the housing sector in this region. In countries where mining remains the primary industry, property prices tend to be more cyclical. This highlights the importance of the mining industry to the housing market and the need to enhance risk management in the property sector in response to economic fluctuations.",

Since marketing innovation activities require less time to adopt and less costly investments, firms can apply these activities to mitigate the negative consequences of those tough economic times. Moreover, since marketing innovation is a dynamic capability included in the Resource-based View, it is a good strategy for businesses to react to unexpected and uncontrollable external business risk factors. In this regard, this research aims to analyse whether firms’ application of marketing innovation activities differs depending on their perception of business risk during and after periods of COVID-19, the war between Russia and Ukraine, rising energy prices, and economic recessions. To achieve this goal, this research analyzes 1367 enterprises operating in various European countries and across multiple industries, including iron and mining. Moreover, the research data are collected through online questionnaire surveys, and the researchers apply Ordinal Logistic Regression Tests for analysis purposes. The results show that firms apply marketing innovation activities more when they perceive business risk less intensively during and after tough economic times. The sectors and countries in which firms operate, as well as the geographical scope of companies’ activities, may explain the findings of this study.",

Excess thermal energy will be stored in a thermal buffer, while surplus electrical energy will be stored in batteries.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the properties of antifriction diamond-containing ceramics in a wide range of loads. During this study, a composite diamond-containing ceramic material was obtained, and a technology was presented, according to which, at the first stage of obtaining the material, a workpiece of dispersed aluminum and diamond is sintered, and then its surface layer is modified by the method of microplasma electrolytic oxidation. The formed part combines the physical and mechanical properties of the aluminum matrix, the base, with the tribological properties of the ceramic-hardened layer containing partially graphitized dispersed diamonds. As a result of the study, a positive example of using a friction pair of diamond-containing ceramic material – ceramics as a working unit of a colloid mill (disperser) was obtained. The developed model allows synthesizing diamond-containing ceramic materials with specified tribotechnical properties.

    "abstract": "Efficient management of limited natural metal resources and minimizing environmental impact is crucial in modern industrial production. This study focuses on the selective separation and recovery of copper from industrial waste through hydrometallurgical and electrolytic methods. Industrial metal waste, particularly from electronics and manufacturing, contains valuable materials that, if properly processed, can serve as secondary raw materials. The research investigates various technological approaches for metal recycling, emphasizing hydrometallurgical leaching and electrolysis as effective recovery methods. The experimental part explores the processing of copper, brass, and bronze waste through sulfuric acid leaching, enhanced with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, followed by electrolysis. The efficiency of copper recovery was assessed by atomic absorption spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Results demonstrate that leaching at elevated temperatures (60°C) significantly improves metal dissolution rates, leading to higher recovery yields. Electrolytic processing of the leachate successfully produced high-purity copper, confirming the viability of this method for sustainable metal recycling. The findings highlight the environmental and economic benefits of recovering metals from industrial waste, reducing the reliance on primary raw materials, and minimizing waste generation. Further optimization of process parameters, including temperature, pH, and electrolyte composition, could enhance recovery efficiency and metal purity. This study contributes to the development of sustainable recycling strategies, promoting circular economy principles and reducing the environmental footprint of metal production.",

The Carboniferous and Middle Triassic rocks were tested. Macroscopic and microscopic description, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), qualitative and quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as tests of physical-mechanical and sorption properties were performed. The limestones are high-purity rocks (CaO content ≥49.95 wt.%; CaCO3 content ≥93.8%) with a low proportion of admixtures (mainly SiO2 as well as Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO and Na2O). They have a broad scope of applications. Depending on their origin and properties, they can be used for the production of cement and lime, as a road aggregate, fertilizer, animal feed additive, mine safety dust or a sorbent for flue gas desulphurization in the iron and steel industry, as well as a component for glass production. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis can be applied as an effective principal tool for assessing the suitability of limestone for various economic purposes.

Field observations indicate that the rock is medium to coarse-grained, hard, and compact, having dark brown and greyish colour on weathered and fresh surfaces, respectively. Petrographic study exhibits that the rocks are euhedral to anhedral, having the dominant concentrations of plagioclase, quartz, K-feldspar, biotite, hornblende, fluorite, and andalusite, with a minor amount of clinopyroxene, muscovite, rutile, and actinolite. The physical and mechanical characterization includes grading, specific gravity and absorption, flakiness and elongation indices, Los Angeles abrasion, and soundness. These analyses demonstrate compliance with standard permissible ranges, confirming their potential as construction materials. Mechanical analysis yields average uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and uniaxial tensile strength (UTS) 52.96 MPa and 8.54 MPa, respectively, classifying the rock within the moderate to strong category. The above-integrated study reveals that medium-grained granodiorites exhibit higher strength compared to coarse-grained varieties. Plagioclase and mica contents are identified as the dominant controlling factors, whereas quartz and K-feldspar show negligible influence on the strength of the granodiorite. Considering the favourable mechanical properties, excellent and extensive exposure and logistical accessibility of the outcrop, it is concluded that the granodiorite of the Mayar area is recommended for high-load-bearing applications, including Dir- Chitral motorway, CPEC developmental schemes, railway ballast, highways, and dimension stone cladding. Moreover, the quarry byproducts can be utilized as sustainable aggregates in secondary construction applications.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present preliminary findings from geological field investigation that may indicate the presence of a new iron deposit in the Central Anatolian Iron Province (Turkiye). The geological field investigation identified massive iron ore outcrops, indicating significant iron mineralization. According to the analysis results of the samples taken from the iron ore outcrops, the outcrops contain 35.87-81.75% Fe. Silica ratios are 10.85 - 48.40%. Fe/Mn ratios, Si-Al values, Si/Al ratios, Fe/Ti and Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) ratios, Fe-Six2-Mn ratios, Fe-Al-Mn ratios, (Ca+Al+Mn) - (Ti+V) and (Ti+V) - (Al+Mn) ratios of the mineralization were evaluated. The positions of the samples taken on all distinction diagrams indicate that the mineralization in the study area was formed by hydrothermal activity (under relatively high-temperature conditions at 300-500 °C). The fact that the iron ores contain small amounts of transition metals such as Ni and V suggests that they are not related to volcanic rocks but are similar to the Lake Superior iron formation type. Ore deposition probably occurred through transgression-regression at the continental passive margin or the arc-back basin. Therefore, a model can be proposed where the iron ores in the study area were deposited by combining two stages in a continental margin or arc-back basin due to transgression-regression processes. These two stages are (1) hydrothermal fluid and fluvial activity (terrestrial dendritic sedimentation) that precipitates Fe and Si, and (2) oxidation and iron formation. Therefore, the primary source of the mineralization may have been volcanosedimentary or exhalative sedimentary type (synsedimentary), and later metamorphism and tectonic events may have led to the present position of the mineralization.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of urban areas has resulted in an increasing demand for underground construction. In most cases, each tunnel line usually builds two parallel tunnels to facilitate efficient traffic management. The ground deformation mechanisms during the excavation of twin tunnels differ from that which occurs during the construction of a single tunnel. The construction of two tunnels in the urban area causes ground displacements and stress redistribution, which pose a mechanical impact on the adjacent pile foundations and underground structures. Therefore, optimization in tunnel design requires predicting the response of pile structures and adjacent underground infrasturcture. The present study delves into the interaction analysis between the twin tunnels and the piled structure through the use of the finite element method. The analysis concentrates on aspects such as surface settlements, the response of tunnel linings and the behavior of piles resulting from the interaction between twin tunnels and deep foundations. The obtained results indicate that the magnitude of the internal forces and displacements of the front pile P1 closer to twin tunnels is higher than for the rear piles P2, P3 and P4. The magnitude of the internal forces and displacements of the piles for the case of twin tunnels T1 and T2 construction are greater than that for the case of single tunnel T1. The second tunnel T2 is located near the multi-storey building, and it is strongly affected by twin tunnels-piled structure interaction and therefore the magnitude of the normal forces and bending moments of the tunnel lining for the case of construction twin tunnels T1, T2 beneath piled-structure are greater than that for case of twin tunnels T1, T2.",

    "abstract": "Accurately determining rock strength characteristics, such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Brazilian tensile strength (BTS), and Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA), through conventional methods is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, this study develops efficient artificial neural network (ANN) models optimized with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) algorithms to predict UCS, BTS, and LAA from petrographic properties, advancing civil engineering applications. A total of 100 dolerite samples were analyzed to assess their strength and petrographic characteristics, with the ANNs trained on the three aforementioned algorithms. The results indicate that the BR model achieved the highest accuracy, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9999 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3164. The LM model also demonstrated strong performance with an R-value of 0.9997 and an RMSE of 0.8619. The BR and LM models significantly outperformed the SCG model, which had an R-value of 0.9954 and an RMSE of 2.398. Sensitivity analysis identified plagioclase and chlorite as the most influential factors in predicting rock mechanical parameters. The effectiveness of the BR and LM techniques highlights their potential to offer substantial time and cost savings in rock strength prediction.",

    "abstract": "One of the significant contributors to global warming is electricity production based on conventional fossil fuels, which exert a considerable environmental burden. This dependency can be mitigated through the increased utilization of Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), which offer both environmental and economic advantages. However, one of the main challenges associated with RERs, particularly wind energy, is their frequent installation at locations remote from load centers, which poses difficulties in efficient energy transmission. In this study, wind speed and power have been forecasted using three types of artificial neural networks: Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Cascaded Forward Neural Network (CFNN), and improved Feedforward Neural Network (id-FFN). The dataset used in this work was obtained from the Global Wind Atlas and covers the Silesian Region of Poland for the year 2023. Data from January to June were used to train the neural networks using a modified version of the Metaheuristic Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with Bat Algorithm Acceleration Coefficients (MHPSO-BAAC-x). The trained models were then employed to predict wind speed and power for the period from July to December 2023. To assess the accuracy of the forecasts, the following statistical error metrics were applied: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The predicted values were subsequently compared with the actual data for the same period to evaluate the effectiveness of the models. The id-FFN model demonstrated the best performance, achieving values of 0.0262 m/s for MAE, 2.62% for MAPE, and 0.0152 m/s for RMSE, confirming its high precision and reliability. The obtained results suggest that the developed forecasting system has the potential to support future planning and integration of wind power stations into the national power system.",

    "abstract": "Dry pluviation is a technique applied to prepare sandy soil samples for physical modeling. In this method, soil particles rainfall in the mold after passing through the mesh with certain opening sizes. In this study, a dry pluviation device was designed and manufactured to examine the effect of shutter properties, including the height of fall (HF), deposition intensity (DI), and gradation on relative density (RD). A two-piece mold was used to evaluate the homogeneity of the sample. The RD measured at the top and bottom of the mold is the same, indicating that the fabricated sample is homogeneous. The results indicate that HF and DI have a direct and indirect relation with RD, respectively, but RD is constant for HF≥1200 mm. In order to investigate the impact of shutter properties on DI and RD, α ratio (total area of the shutter holes to the area of the deposition surface) was defined, and a linear relationship is proposed between DI and α. The results revealed an indirect relation between RD and α, but for α≥0.130, RD is constant. In order to assess the simultaneous effect of grain size and shutter properties on RD, an independent grain size variable (i.e., α/D50) was defined, and a linear relationship was established between α/D50 and RD. The results showed that the variable α/D50 can be considered a useful criterion for designing a shutter to reconstitute sandy soils with different gradations.",

The wear of drill bits is closely related to the specific energy that expresses the energy consumption of the drilling process and significantly affects the total cost of drilling. In this article, the correlation between the wear intensity and the specific energy was examined. For the purpose of obtaining the necessary information, a series of experiments were performed on a horizontal laboratory drilling rig with the use of 8 types of rocks and 5 diamond-impregnated small-diameter core drill bits with synthetic diamonds of various qualities. The selected drilling mode was the mode with a constant rotation speed and an increasing thrust force. Results of the experimental measurements indicated that relatively high rotation speeds were preferred for the tested drill bits for the purpose of efficient drilling. The lowest amount of the specific energy required for drilling was observed for sandstone and andesite, i.e. the rocks in which radial cracks were formed around the chipped-off crater during the drilling. A simple linear regression between the intensity of wear of the drill bits and the specific energy was found. The evaluation of the results of this experimental research also showed that the quality of the used diamonds significantly affected the wear intensity.",

    "abstract": "While drilling slant holes, flat holes, or designer wells, drilling operators are faced with extra work in preparing the borehole for the landing. For example, during the trip, it is difficult to move drilling tools along the borehole. As a rule, the technology selection measures carried out at drilling enterprises enable the landing of a casing column in a single run or reduce the time required for preparing the borehole, as well as decrease the construction time of wells during the casing landing. Nevertheless, the reduction of extra work in the process of preparing the borehole for the landing is an urgent problem. The completion of wells includes their fastening, landing, and casing cementing jobs. However, not in all cases does landing the casing strings go without complications. The main complication during the landing of the casing strings is their inability to extend along the borehole, resulting in their non-admission. The primary reasons for the occurrence of slacking off, tight pulls, and seizures are the abundance of clay minerals, the discrepancy between the properties and composition of the drilling and washing fluid, and the flushing mode dictated by the geological and technical conditions of the formation. Seizures are the most common and serious complications during drilling operations.",

Experiments were carried out in the area of the Chrośla cadastral district (Dębe Wielkie commune, Mińsk Mazowiecki district, Masovian Voivodeship, Poland). The necessary surveying activities included: measurement of GCPs using the GNSS-RTN method in relation to the ASG-EUPOS reference stations network, UAV photogrammetric surveys, field surveys of selected building corners (tachymetric method and points of the surveying control points network established for this task, using the GNSS-RTN technique), and computational and analytical activities. Images acquired from the DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise had a GSD of 2.85 cm, and from the DJI Zenmuse P1– 1.5 cm. Selected building corners were measured in the images using the space intersection method (104 corners covering the test area evenly), and the results were compared with the field measurement (GNSS-RTN + tachymetry). The obtained results indicated the possibility of using UAV technology as a fully alternative to traditional geodetic surveys - meeting the accuracy criteria resulting from applicable legal regulations (under specific conditions).",

    "abstract": "In today's world, where growing environmental problems such as climate change, excessive resource consumption, and waste production are becoming increasingly urgent, new strategies for sustainable development are being sought. One such strategy is the circular economy, which represents an alternative to the traditional linear economic model based on the \"take, make, throw\" principle. The circular economy aims to minimise waste and maximise the reuse of resources, thereby contributing not only to environmental protection but also to economic efficiency and social inclusion. In the presented manuscript, we examine the importance and potential of the circular economy in local governments, with an emphasis on the municipality of Čaňa. The aim is to examine how this sustainable model can be implemented at the local level, improve waste management, identify challenges and opportunities for optimisation, and propose concrete measures for transitioning to a more efficient economy. The research aims to develop a sustainable model tailored to the specific needs and capacities of the municipality under study, taking into account existing resources and infrastructure. The aim is to subsequently design a waste collection and treatment system that maximises recycling and reuse of materials, minimises negative environmental impact, and promotes economic efficiency and social justice. With this approach, the research results presented in the manuscript not only contribute to theoretical knowledge about the circular economy but also provide practical guidelines for municipalities and cities seeking to transform their economies towards sustainability. By addressing this topic, the manuscript highlights the significance of the local level in addressing environmental issues and promoting sustainable development, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with implementing a circular economy in practice.",

To meet the growing demand for data services in 5G cellular networks, it is important to develop effective content caching and distribution techniques, to reduce redundant data transmission and thereby improve network efficiency significantly. It is anticipated that energy harvesting and self-powered Small Base Stations' (SBS) are the rudimentary constituents of next-generation cellular networks. However, uncertainties in harvested energy are the primary reasons to opt for energy-efficient (EE) power control schemes to reduce SBS energy consumption and ensure the quality of services for users. Using edge collaborative caching, such EE design can also be achievable via the use of the content cache, decreasing the usage of capacity limited SBSs backhaul and reducing energy utilisation. Renewable energy (RE) harvesting technologies can be leveraged to manage the huge power demands of cellular networks. To reduce carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency, we tailored a more practical approach and propose green caching mechanisms for content distribution that utilise the content caching and renewable energy concept. Simulation results and analysis provide key insights that the proposed caching scheme brings a substantial improvement regarding content availability, cache storage capacity at the edge of cellular networks, enhances energy efficiency, and increases cache collaboration time up to 24%. Furthermore, self-powered base stations and energy harvesting are an ultimate part of next-generation wireless networks, particularly in terms of optimum economic sustainability and green energy in developing countries for the evolution of mobile networks.",

    "abstract": "The bioeconomy has been proposed worldwide as a way to combat global environmental and socio-economic challenges, from climate change to income diversification and food security. Consequently, the term \"bioeconomy\" has gained considerable attention in the economic field over the last 15 years. Interestingly, an alleged global sustainable development model has become the subject of intense sustainability debate among researchers in recent years. The sustainability of the bioeconomy itself remains unanswered today. Most of the previous studies on sustainable bioeconomy focused on the analysis of the impacts on technology related to environmental issues while overlooking the socio-environmental implications and excluding society. Meanwhile, various studies highlight potential socio-environmental negative impacts associated with the new economic model. It is possible that the increased use of biological resources could further compromise ecosystems and create increasing social and ethical issues. Furthermore, this economic model could bring new environmental challenges related to the excessive use of soil and water. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine and identify potential socio-environmental sustainability challenges and pitfalls that need to be addressed in order to ensure a successful transition to a sustainable bioeconomy. Following a systematic literature review, scientific studies and field reports were selected for this review after searching Google Scholar, Web of Science and Scopus databases. The results identified a number of potential key socio-environmental concerns related to the transition to the bioeconomy.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the selective precipitation of copper (Cu2+), nickel (Ni2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions from industrial wastewater by using sodium sulfide (Na2S). The effects of pH, time and free sulfide concentration on the selective precipitation were systematically investigated using synthetically prepared solutions and gold refinery wastewater. First, the optimum precipitation pH values of metals, the amount of Na2S and time were determined by using synthetic solutions containing Cu, Ni and Zn single metal ions. The highest precipitation efficiencies were obtained at a pH of 4, 5.3 and 5.3 for Cu, Ni and Zn, respectively. Based on these results, the effects of Na2S stoichiometry and time of precipitation were investigated with synthetically prepared solutions containing mixed metal ions (100 mg/L Cu2+, 90 mg/L Ni2+ and 100 mg/L Zn2+). Metal sulfide precipitation efficiencies increased with increasing amounts of Na2S and reached a maximum at a ratio of 1:1.75 (Metal ion: Na2S molar ratio). Lastly, the results obtained from the experiments performed with synthetic solutions were used for the metal sulfide precipitation from industrial wastewater. The precipitation from refining wastewater containing 10 g/L Cu2+, 0.3 g/L Ni2+ and 3 g/L Zn2+ ions was achieved at pH values from 2.3 to 5.3. At a pH of 2.3, Cu2+ precipitated as CuS (Cu2S) at 100% efficiency. While the Ni2+ concentration in the solution decreased by only 44% at a pH of 2.3, the Zn2+ concentration decreased by 52%. At a pH of 5.3, Cu2+ and Zn2+ precipitated together at 100%.",

    "abstract": "Selecting the underground mining method is one of the most difficult decisions any mining engineer makes when designing a new mine or opening new parts in an existing mine. The underground mining method selection depends on many mining-geological, technical and economic factors. The process of selecting a mine excavation method is a multi-criteria decision-making process since many factors are considered when selecting a mining method. The selection of the most suitable mining method is of great importance for each mine, and this is especially evident in the phase of preparation and excavation of the ore deposit and optimization of the total cost of excavation. This paper uses the Fuzzy TOPSIS method to select the underground mining method for metallic mineral resources as one of the most important multi-criteria decision-making methods. The methodology presented will enable the application of other fuzzy methods to solve problems related to the mining method selection.",

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of the Limestone of the Kohat Formation. The Eocene Kohat limestone is generally exposed in the Kohat, Hangu, and Bannu districts. Kohat Formation limestone is well exposed throughout the Northern Kohat fold and thrust belt at Togh Bala village. It is cream to grey, hard, compact, well-bedded and fossiliferous. Kohat Formation has been identified into two lithofacies which are from base to top calcareous shale lithofacies with large benthic foraminifera and limestone lithofacies. The faunal assemblage indicates that the Kohat Formation was deposited in an inner to middle shelf environment. The petrographic analyses of samples of the Kohat Formation depict that it principally consists of calcite (60-90%) with a small to trace assemblage of dolomite (0-3%), ungraded quartz (0-1.5%), opaque minerals (0-1.2%) and fossils (8-40%). Aggregate physical properties like water absorption (0.88%), specific gravity (2.69), soundness (2.55%), Los Angeles abrasion value (23.06%), aggregate crushing value (11.56%), aggregate impact value (12.68%), flaky index (9.90%), elongation index (12.76%) and coating and stripping values (96.27%) conform to available standards. Our results indicate that Kohat Limestone is safe in terms of Alkali Carbonate Reactivity (ACR) and Alkali-Silica Reactivity (ASR). The facies, thin section study, geochemical, and geotechnical understanding of Kohat Formation indicate that these aggregate deposits are potential aggregate sources for ballast (railway), road, building material, concrete, mortar and other mega projects for connecting Asia and Europe.",

People started to take advantage of computer technology to compensate for the lack of possibility of leaving their homes. Virtual travel, which can be conducted in many different ways, has become one of the ways of using this technology. Therefore, analyses have been carried out to investigate the possibility of applying 3D technology to promote underground tourist attractions. The Underground Tourist Route in Rzeszow (Poland) and the underground of the Old City Hall in Lviv (Ukraine) were selected as the research objects. They were inventoried with the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) method and with the application of the Faro Focus 3D laser scanner. Then films demonstrating virtual tour around the inventoried objects were created based on the clouds of points obtained during the measurements. As a part of the research, it was verified whether these methods could encourage people to visit the researched objects more than their standard advertisements presented on the Internet. The evaluation was performed with the use of a semantic differentiation test. The survey research carried out for this purpose was implemented using the CAWI technique. The questionnaires were available for the respondents from the last week of April 2020 to the first week of July 2020. The size of the researched group accounted for 393 people. The respondents came from 23 countries on 5 continents. The obtained results confirm that the use of 3D technology in the promotion of tourist attractions may be a good decision.",

    "abstract": "The positive contributions that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make in the iron and mining industries are vital for the development of the global economy. However, their costly operations in disadvantaged regions and the green economy interests of financial institutions have made them face more financial obstacles that decrease their export and financial performance. In this regard, their ability to use marketing communication tools that are included in the dynamic capability of Resource-based View theory (RBV) can reduce their exporting and financial performance concerns. This is because using these marketing communication tools presents them with less costly marketing solutions and provides competitive advantages for SMEs against their larger-sized rivals. In this regard, this paper aims to analyze the impact of one-way (telemarketing, direct mail, website, etc.) and two-way marketing communication tools (social media platforms) on SMEs' export intention and financial performance from the iron and mining industries. The research team collected data from 1221 SMEs operating in Eastern European countries via an internet-mediated questionnaire to hit this target. The impacts of the marketing communication tools on export intention and financial performance are analyzed via the Binary Logistic Regression Test. The results show that while using one-way and two-way marketing communication tools does not affect the export intention of SMEs, it negatively affects their financial performance. The reason for these results might be related to the location and sector in which SMEs operate.",

    "abstract": "In the exploitation of machinery and equipment, one of the most important parameters is the dynamic state of the object. Observing residual processes is the most popular method of assessing the dynamic state. In particular, dynamic residual processes are a carrier of diagnostic information. Measuring the vibrations and noise of working mini-mining machines provides knowledge about the dynamics of the assessed machinery. Many years of knowledge and experience have allowed for the creation of diagnostic procedures. Within most machines used in the industry, the procedures considered standard allow for an effective diagnostic assessment and optimal management of mini-mining machine exploitation. The applicability of these standards is quite wide. However, there are machines with parameters that prevent the application of said standards. Mini-mining machines used in subterranean mining are one of these machines. In the case of diagnostic assessment of continuous miners, chain conveyors, as well as other machinery used in the technological chain, the usage of assessment brackets consistent with adopted standards is incorrect. In the diagnostic assessment of these types of mini-mining machines, an analysis of long-term trends is often used. The determination of acceptable vibration levels is obtained heuristically through observations of the damage up to the state of emergency. In the article, methods of mini mining machines state assessment using models of machine degradation, using Weibull distribution, are presented. The presented method has been used in real results of vibration measurement of underground machinery used in a coal mine. The analyses showed a large effectiveness of the presented method.",

This paper examines the dynamics of Brent Crude Oil prices over the previous 35 years, utilizing predictive modelling techniques to project future prices and analyzing historical trends and relationships with the GDPs of major economies. The statistical methods used in this paper include the moving average and Pearson correlation coefficient. While correlation studies show significant positive links between Brent Crude Oil prices and the GDPs of major economies like China, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Russia, and the United States, historical data analysis reveals large price volatility. Highly accurate price forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) modelling approaches provides detailed risk management and decision-making information in the global energy market. The application of the Neural Network and the ARIMA model shows an increase in the price of Brent crude oil in the next year, 2024. Identifying the importance of the Brent crude oil price forecast and its effect on the international market is highly needed. This paper thus might help to increase economic growth. These results highlight the importance of advanced modelling techniques and economic indicators in managing oil price changes and help make informed decisions in the energy industry.",

    "abstract": "Poland is the leader in the performance of international transport in the EU, serving more than half of its market. The most common branch of transport is road transport, predominantly heavy goods transport, which contributes to the strain on road infrastructure. Furthermore, around one-fifth of those vehicles may exceed the permissible total mass. In this respect, the increasing demand for road transport further complicates the slowdown and prevention of road network degradation. Overloads have significant consequences for road infrastructure, economics, and traffic safety. Load management in transport companies is crucial for eliminating overloads. This article aims to assess how companies conducting freight transport manage the cargo weighing process in the context of potential overloads. Data from a survey among transport industry companies in Poland were analysed. Using non-parametric U Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, the influence between propensity for cargo overloading and the method of cargo weighing was examined. The results indicated that the propensity for cargo overloading in TSL industry companies is significantly associated with both the occurrence of the weighing process and its method, as well as the responsibility for this process among individual participants in the transport process.",

    "abstract": "Pyrite is considered the major gold-bearing, in which gold is often finely disseminated throughout the matrix of refractory sulfide ores. To improve the gold extraction, pyrite oxidation is required in order to destroy the refractoriness behavior. This study investigated the use of four oxidizing agents, S_2 O_8^(2-), H_2 O_2, 〖ClO〗_4^- and 〖Cr〗_2 O_7^(2-), to oxidize pyrite. The objective was to enhance the oxidation efficiency of pyrite by optimizing the pH and reaction time conditions. Experimental results showed that the most efficient oxidant for pyrite oxidation was peroxydisulfate S_2 O_8^(2-), and the oxidation efficiency of iron in pyrite varies in the following order: S_2 O_8^(2-) &gt; H_2 O_2 &gt;〖 ClO〗_4^- &gt; 〖Cr〗_2 O_7^(2-). The optimum pH for the studied oxidizing agents were pH = 6 for S_2 O_8^(2-), H_2 O_2, and 〖ClO〗_4^-, and pH = 2 for 〖Cr〗_2 O_7^(2-), for which the oxidation efficiency reached respectively 76.51%, 20.19%, 16.83%, and 15.40% after 6 hours of reaction. The high oxidation efficiency of pyrite by S_2 O_8^(2-) at pH = 6 is explained by the formation of sulfate radical (〖SO〗_4^(•-)) produced by the activation of S_2 O_8^(2-) with Fe2+ released from pyrite. The mechanistic insights of the studied oxidizing agents have been elucidated by analyzing the product species after the oxidation reaction in the filtrate by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and characterizing the solid residue by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The obtained results suggest that S_2 O_8^(2-) is a promising oxidizing agent for the oxidative pretreatment of refractory pyritic gold ores.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge of the spatial development of phenomena is crucial in the case of research in economics, geological survey, mining, earth resources and geography. In the literature one can diagnose an important methodological and implementation gap concerning the selection of the set of areal units within the Aggregation Problem. The issue relates to determining boundaries of areal units (regions), whose properties are described by spatial data. The boundaries of areas should be established in such a way that a given analyzed phenomenon is influenced by the same main causes. Only in this case, the analyzed spatial data will properly reflect the impact of main causes, the properties of phenomena and dependencies between them. This means that determining the proper boundaries of areas is a necessary condition for receiving correct conclusions (e.g. delimiting metropolitan areas, assessing mineral resource potential and deposits, or assessing the dynamics of surface processes). From this perspective, the main objective of the article is presenting the proposal for solving the Aggregation Problem, where as the case study the economic analysis of agrarian resources and structure is used. The solution to the problem will lead to establishing the system of macroregions, where the obtained proposal of a system of four sets of areal units is important from the point of view of spatial research. The main added value of the research and its specific contribution to the literature is based on the fact that the proposed solution to the Aggregation Problem can be considered as universal, which is not limited to selected scientific disciplines. The methodology presented in the article can be effectively applied to other spatial research in the field of geology and mining, where the most appropriate research field is the issue of locating areas with appropriate properties or areas which are affected by given analised phenomena.",

    "abstract": "One of the most prospective developments of hard rock mechanical excavation methods is the possibility of the disc tools usage in new constructions of mining machinery.For many years, such research on the excavation using both symmetrical and asymmetrical disc tools has been conducted in the Department of Mining, Dressing and Transporting Machines in the AGH University in Cracow.The primary effect of these tests is an innovative solution of a mining head with complex motion trajectory asymmetrical disc tools.The concept of the disc head assumes the mining of rock stone by chipping as a result of a complex trajectory of disc tools.To develop such innovative construction of roadheader head, determination of work principles and guidelines based on laboratory tests was necessary.The article presents the methodology, course, and results of the disc tools mining tests.Those studies included quasi-static and dynamic experiments of excavation using disc tools.In this paper constructions of specially prepared laboratory stands for the examination of disc tools of complex trajectory were presented.Each trial has been performed for different physical properties of rock samples and different excavation technology.The conducted research significantly broadens the scope of knowledge in the field of mining with asymmetrical disc tools.The results of tests described in the paper could be used in the construction of innovative machines and devices for mechanical hard rock mining, in opposition to classical mining methods involving explosive materials.",

    "abstract": "Value Stream Mapping is an efficient and powerful tool of the Lean Manufacturing system that helps in eliminating Non-Value-Added activities (NVAs) in a process by clearly exposing the areas where there is waste in the Value stream (Information and material flow).Value Stream Mapping is a standardized way to document the steps in a process and systematically analyze the steps to develop improvement plans.The \"current state map\" is a foundation for the improved \"future state map\" that is developed after eliminating the NVAs identified in the current state map and thereby decreasing the lead time.It can be implemented not only in manufacturing sectors but also in many different sectors such as IT sectors, Healthcare sectors and government service sectors to identify and eliminate the processes or operations that do not add any value to the product or in other words, the processes for which the customer is not willing to pay.The main objective of this work is to study the process flow of a part family in a steel industry located in Southern part of India using value stream mapping and eliminate the NVAs in the process by making some process and layout changes which will reduce the lead time and increase the profit of the organization.First, suitable value stream mapping is carried out for parts with similar kinds of existing manufacturing processes.Then all the NVAs present in the flow of the process are identified.Then, certain changes, such as converting the manufacturing layout into a cellular manufacturing layout and introducing continuous heat treatment processes, are made in order to eliminate the NVAs.The total lead time reduction for each part varies from 14.55 hours to 33.41 hours which is a significant amount of reduction.This paper also reviews the existing literature on Value Stream Mapping and how its implementation helps organizations successfully eliminate the waste and take them towards becoming a successful Lean Enterprise.",

Field tests were carried out on sandy loam on piles models (M 1:3) with different lengths and cross-sections of the pyramidal segment. It has been established that the driving of tapered-prismatic piles is accompanied by both large (by 1.10-1.60 times) and lower (by 8.0-37.0%) energy consumption for their driving in comparison with conventional prismatic and pyramidal piles. It was also revealed that under the vertical pressing load, the bearing capacity of the tapered-prismatic piles is 1.09-1.48 times, and under the horizontal static load, it is 1.17-1.80 times higher than the prismatic pile. It has been established that with an increase in the length of the pyramidal part of the experimental piles, there is an increase in their bearing capacity by 1.12-1.34 times. Equations are proposed for determining the bearing capacity of tapered-prismatic piles. The research results serve as the basis for the development of recommendations for the calculation and design of tapered-prismatic piles. The revealed features of the behaviour of tapered-prismatic piles allow to reasonably assign the length and dimensions of the cross-section of their pyramidal segment.",

This study was carried out in the Gharb plain, which belongs to the Sebou watershed in the North-West of Morocco. The goal of this study is to evaluate the contamination of the groundwater by insecticides using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) analyses. This research paper covers the analysis of 20 samples of 20 different wells for an irrigated perimeter of 250,000 ha of the surface. Further, the analyses show the presence of intense contamination caused by insecticides, which are concentrated in the southern part of the study area, where the contamination level is 50% of the water samples. This exceeds the norm of the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, which is represented in 0.5 µg/l. Furthermore, the analyses also detect the presence of 22 active ingredients of insecticides, such as malathion, methomyl alderine, dieldrin, and fenthion. Risk assessment in our studies allowed us to determine that the different RQ calculated for five insecticides (Malathion; Mythomil; chloropyrifos-ethyl; Diazinon) recorded in underground water were up to 1, which proves the intensive use of insecticide in this region and the high risk of contamination.",

    "abstract": "Mining has historically been known as a high-risk industry. Coal and gas outbursts are one of the most significant accidents that occur in underground coal mines. Despite many years of research, the resources and mechanisms of this phenomenon are not well understood. Thus, it is difficult to forecast and control these events. As the mining depth and density increase, initial gas pressure and gas content of coal seams continue to increase, and the risk of explosion increases. Hence, explosion-prone areas expand gradually. As a result, a dynamic phenomenon has emerged in areas where there is no danger of outbursts. The risk of outbursts becomes more and more serious in coal mines. A coal outburst risk assessment includes evaluating the risk factors to what degree are present and then determining the risk areas of the mine. In this study, the Cluster Analysis method was implemented to identify the risk level of coal seams based on the evaluation of the outburst risk factors for an underground coal mine. Coal and gas outbursts occurring in Zonguldak hard coal basin were divided into two clusters, Cluster A and Cluster B. Coal seams in Cluster A were determined riskier than Cluster B coal seams.",

Data were obtained from the Amadeus database. The sample contains 348 financial reports of companies from 2019 to 2017. Research is focused on V4 companies that have the sum of total assets higher than 2,000,000 EUR, as well as the sum of operating revenue is higher than 100,000 EUR. Three recommended models were used, namely the modified Jones model, Industry model, and Kothari model. The explanatory power of these models was tested by using several criteria. Based on the results, the modified Jones model was chosen for earnings management detection. According to the results, companies in the mining and quarrying sector in V4 use earnings management techniques to manage the profit. It is not possible to clearly determine in which direction they manage their profit more often. Different values were measured in the two observed periods. Based on the results, Czech and Slovak companies used earnings management techniques to increase their profit. On the other hand, Poland and Hungarian companies used earnings management techniques to decrease it. Very large as well as large companies used earnings management techniques to decrease their profit; medium-sized companies used earnings management techniques to increase it.",

It should be borne in mind that Poland still belongs to the countries in which electric energy production and thermal energy production are based on hard coal and lignite. The research work results described in the article present efficiency assessment aspects in the case of different longwall technological systems in the LW Bogdanka. Advantages and disadvantages resulting from using shearer and plow systems are given. An impact of dilution in the run-of-mine on the coal quality is analyzed, and some recommendations emerging from this analysis are suggested. On the basis of the conducted in situ experiments, technical possibilities of reducing dirt are described. As an efficiency assessment is a multi-criterion process, so it requires continuous monitoring of production parameters. The article also contains an analysis of longwall systems in the aspect of dust control. An impact of mining, technical and technological parameters on generated dust amount, in particular in the case of a shearer-equipped longwall face, is discussed. In the conclusions, it is highlighted that an efficient assessment process in the case of longwall systems is complicated as an impact of different factors should be taken into consideration. It is suggested to use the data integration platform based on the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Due to the SOA, any mistakes in the scope of the functionality of individual systems can be detected very quickly. Such an approach is fundamental for the realization of the TPM (Total Productive Maintenance), leading to the creation of the so-called Mine of Smart Solutions.",

To study the evolution characteristics of pressure relief in soft-hard composite coal seam based on directional hydraulic flushing technology, taking Hudi coal mine in China as the engineering background, and the pressure relief effect of directional hydraulic flushing on 'two soft and one hard' composite coal seam was studied by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The stress evolution of the whole coal seam under a single hole and porous interaction of different flushing radii were analyzed. The field test of directional hydraulic flushing in tectonic soft coal seam similar to protective layer mining was conducted. Results show that when the flushing diameter is 3-4 m, the influence range of stress disturbance covers the whole coal seam, and the vertical stress relief of the primary coal seam is the largest, which provides a theoretical basis for coal seam pressure relief and permeability enhancement technology. The average daily gas extraction (ADGE) concentration has doubled, and the ADGE purity has increased from 0.03 m3/d to 1.07m3/d. The target period of gas extraction is shortened from the expected 6 months to 1 month, and the average daily driving speed of coal roadway increases from 2.32 m/d to 5.37 m/d. The gas extraction efficiency is significantly improved, and the risk of gas outburst is effectively reduced, which has important theoretical and practical significance for improving the pressure relief and permeability enhancement efficiency of the soft and low permeability coal seam.",

    "abstract": "Underground mining operations are subject to a number of natural hazards. Events resulting from these hazards are difficult to predict, and if they occur, they disrupt the entire mining process and pose a great danger to the crew. Some of the most dangerous include ventilation hazards involving methane explosions and fires caused by the spontaneous combustion of coal. The complex state of the underground environment means that these hazards oftentimes occur simultaneously, making mining conditions even worse. The following paper addresses this issue by developing methodology for determining areas endangered by methane explosions and coal spontaneous combustion in goaves. The reference to goaves results from the fact that this particular area is most frequently affected by coal spontaneous combustion and accumulation of dangerous amounts of methane. The developed methodology was based on model tests with the use of the CFD method and data necessary to develop a numerical model. The research encompassed a real longwall in one of the hard coal mines, ventilated with the Y system during its exploitation, which is beneficial in the case of the methane hazard but worsens the safety in terms of the self-ignition of coal. As a result of the conducted research, for the exploitation conditions, dangerous zones were specified due to a potential possibility of methane explosion and self-heating of coal. The basis for determining dangerous zones were the criteria of occurrence of the examined phenomena. In this study, the zones were identified for each of the investigated hazards separately and for their simultaneous occurrence. Thus, the aim of the study, which involved the determination of potentially hazardous zones by applying modern methods of modelling in the mining area, was achieved. The results are an immensely important source of information for activities aimed at improving safety in the studied area, in relation to the studied threats.",

The study consists of two parts. The first part deals with methods of analysing working conditions in the mining industry. A key element of the literature review is the econometric methods that have been used by researchers to analyse accidents at work in mining. In the empirical part (the second part of the paper), the authors present the results of their own econometric analysis. The authors use econometric models in predicting the indicator (W*) – total number of people injured in accidents per thousand employees. Testing classical econometric models, the authors obtained the best forecasts (based on the obtained forecast errors) in the Winters' model and the Brown's model. The accident at work in mining is an important topic for research because the branch of industry belongs to the branch with hard work. Health and safety in mines has a great importance for the sake of specific conditions in that kind of industry. Continuous analysis of accidents at work is necessary in evaluation of system effectiveness of health and safety system in all mines. Forecasting of accident at work can help miners to build safety in mines",

    "abstract": "Discrete fractures may exist in thick coal seam and significantly impact the top coal stability in the Longwall Top Coal Caving method (LTCC) both ahead of shield support (top coal fall) and behind shield support (top coal caving). The top coal stability in such conditions is not well understood in the literature and has been studied from either fall or caving behaviour. In this paper, a discontinuum-based numerical program is used to study longwall top coal stability when discrete fractures exist in coal seam and vary in characteristics (i.e., orientation, density, stiffness, strength, and intersecting fractures). The study demonstrates that the existence of discrete fractures decreases the top coal stability ahead of shield support, particularly in initial face extraction. The parametric study finds that when the fracture orientation makes an angle of 90 degrees to the positive x-axis, it has the least impact on top coal fall. When the fractures plunge into the mined-out area, they facilitate top coal caving and vice versa when they plunge into the unmined area. The study reveals that the fracture density is directly proportional to top coal fall and top coal caving. Meanwhile, the fracture stiffness and strength are inversely proportional to both top coal fall and caving. The study also demonstrates the important role of coal seam characteristics (strength, elastic modulus, and depth) in top coal fall. The findings from this paper can assist engineers in improving panel geometry design and roof control for efficient underground mining when discrete fractures exist and vary in a coal seam.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing reliance on alternative and renewable energy sources in recent years, coal is set to continue being the most vital element of the global energy sector. The world coal supply (1,070 billion tons) shall last for 130 years with the current mining levels. In contrast to some large countries (such as the USA and Germany) reducing their coal production and consumption, Russia plans to increase the coal production levels as part of its strategy regarding the future of the coal mining industry. The annual volume of coal output is more than 440 million tons, 1/3 of which is extracted underground. The current and projected levels of underground coal mining present a set of issues pertaining to elevated dust concentration in the air and increased dust dispersion. High dust concentration in the air leads to damage to the skin, mucous membranes and respiratory organs of workers. Also, with high dust content, visibility in the longwalls decreases, the risk of injury and accidents increases. The present article deals with the formation of detrimental dust conditions that happen in the course of cleaning and preparatory mining operations in coal mines. The article reviews the international practices on dust reduction in coal mining operations and provides an overview of studies on dustiness levels and airborne dust composition in longwall faces of coal mines. It also presents mathematical models dealing with projections on dust composition, including projections on most hazardous dust particles the size of 0.1-10 and 0.1-35 μm. The article also presents a newly developed wetting method showing increased effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Since Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in iron and mining industries are significant contributors not only for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and labour creation of countries but also export volumes of nations, they have also crucial roles to reduce unemployment rates, and increase amount of exports. But comparing to their larger counterparts, SMEs encounter more financing obstacles that might make them to become non-competitive. Within this context, their usage of social media platforms might increase their competitiveness because these digital marketing channels provide less costly solutions for their activities. But depending on their characteristics, their willingness and propensity to implement social media channels in their marketing operations can show differences. In this regard, this paper intends to examine whether the usage of social media channels by SMEs in iron and mining industries differ depending on their size and length of doing business. To hit this target, the researchers have created a questionnaire survey and have directed it to the randomly selected respondents from Cribis database. 702 SMEs that operate iron and mining industries of Slovakia and Hungary have fulfilled the survey. Independent Sample T test is applied to explore differences in the selected variables. While the usage of social media platforms by smaller and larger SMEs does not differ, older SMEs apply social media channels more than younger SMEs. These results are consistent for both Slovak and Hungarian SMEs. The reason of similarities in both nations’ SMEs might be related with similar social-economic conditions of these nations, education level and experience of firm executives. The cooperation of policymakers with SMEs, universities, industrial zones, and unions to encourage the effective usage of social media channels might increase SMEs operating in mining and iron industries and their executives’ competencies and competitive postures to contest with their larger-sized counterparts.",

The paper takes into account an application of discriminate analysis concerning data files of 85 non-bankrupt, and 85 bankrupt firms in the Czech Republic, at which point mining companies are in minority, industrial enterprises predominate. 5-8 input variables in the form of ratios and indexes have been used for the analysis. The non-bankrupt vis-a-vis bankrupt classification accuracy is defined. This paper's investigations were initiated by knowledge concerning final stages of mining company operations in the Czech Republic, as related to the trend of restricting mining activities in the latter part of the last century. Justifiable reasons exist to maintain that parallel developments, and similar company behaviour strategies can be identified also in other industries. From a material standpoint, business is nothing else but a fabrication of products or performing of services, but economically, irrespective of the actual business, it is just a circulation of capital. Originally, it is the capitalisťs own capital (share capital, etc.) or the outside capital (credits, loans, etc.). The capital pays for fixed assets (landed property, buildings, machines, etc.), current assets (raw materials and others inputs), and hiring of workforce. A classical production process starts with the processing of raw materials or semi-products; operation adds the value of fixed assets (depreciations) and workforce to the semi- finished products. Further processing of the semi-finished products is finalised by the production of goods - wares for the market. Marketing and sales of the wares change them into receivables that - being realised - transform again to capital. This capital is a fresh input of the running process of the capital circulation. It refreshes consumed current assets, pays for the workforce, and redresses the balance of fixed assets. A part",

    "abstract": "Mining and processing of raw materials are at the beginning of all industrial value chains. As global demand for raw materials grows, basic raw materials will continue to play a key role. Global value chains have become a dominant feature of world trade. The process of production of goods from raw materials to the finished product, intended for the final consumer, is carried out primarily where the necessary professional and material prerequisites are available, at competitive costs and quality. Although the EU has a long tradition of mining and processing raw materials, as well as rich reserves of aggregates and non-metallic minerals, some metals such as copper and zinc, but also some critical raw materials. However, their use is not optimal for various reasons, such as insufficient investment in geological exploration and extraction, diverse and lengthy national permitting procedures, or low public acceptance. Shortcomings in the EU's mining, processing, recycling, refining and unbundling capacity (e.g. in the case of lithium or rare earths) reflect a lack of resilience and high dependence on supplies from other parts of the world. At the same time, the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on the further direction of industrial policy with an effort to increase diversification and regionalization of production processes, resp. gaining economic sovereignty in strategic areas. Raw materials form the basis of the European economy in order to secure jobs and competitiveness and are essential for maintaining and improving our quality of life. Ensuring reliable, sustainable and unhindered access to and circulation of raw materials in the economy is therefore a growing concern within the EU, not only regionally but also globally. It is for these reasons that it is necessary to examine the consumption of materials in relation to the stage of development of countries.",

This research shows the Denpasar LMWL is δD = 8.5839 x δ18O + 19.876; from the distribution of oxygen-18 isotope, the low 18O value is dominated in the North and Northeast areas, so here this area can be delineated as the potential recharge area; and based on the isotope ratio, groundwater in the unconfined aquifer of Denpasar can be divided into three geneses groups: (a) Groundwater Genesis-A and B groups represent groundwater systems that come from direct rainfall as well as local recharge with low (depleted) to moderate δ18O and δ2H isotope ratios and groundwater groups Genesis-C, which has high (enriched) δ18O and δ2H isotope ratios, is located below the slope of the DMWL.",

    "abstract": "Small and larger dendromass-burning power plants entrust the management of the ash waste to companies which guarantee its ecological disposal. In order to specify the correct disposal or further utilization of the dendromass ash, the various slag and fly ash fractions from a power plant combusting waste wood were analyzed and compared in this work. The plant produces approximately 660 t of ash waste/year. The efficiency of combustion depends on the season, dendromass quality and plant operating conditions. The proportion of carbon residue (incomplete burnt wood-chips) in slag and ash fractions increases in the winter months. Except for the seasonal carbon residue, the crumble slag and fine ashes captured in the flue channel and cyclone are similar in chemical composition and phase (28–44 wt.% CaO; 25–35% SiO2; ~7% Al2O3; ~5% K2O; ~4.5% MgO). The finest ash captured in the fabric filter contains less silicon and alumina compounds (&lt;7% SiO2; ~2% Al2O3) and a significantly higher portion of potassium and sulphur, and chlorine compounds (approx. 13%K2O; 3.5%S; &lt;1.5% Cl) which are well soluble in water. All ash fractions produce strongly alkaline leaches in first contact with water. The differences in the chemical composition of captured ashes provide an impulse for considering the possibility of effective re-utilization of individual fractions.",

    "abstract": "Sustainability is at the heart of continuous product improvement, where social, environmental, and economic considerations are key. This is a difficult task, especially in the area of the following economic and environmental changes, as well as changes in customer expectations. Additionally, it has become crucial to make product decisions that will be based on their entire life cycle (LCA). Although these aspects of sustainability and LCA are popular, bringing them together in one analysis remains challenging. Therefore, the article's objective was to develop a simplified model that supports decision-making, taking into account the criteria of sustainable development and life cycle assessment (LCA). The originality is the proposed model, which operates based on a qualitative indicator (product quality level), an environmental indicator (the product's impact on the environment throughout its life cycle) and a price indicator (purchase price of the product). These indicators are created using the TOPSIS method and the modified ACJ-E method. As a result, a product ranking is created. A novelty is the combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) criteria with quality criteria and the actual purchase price of the product. The model test was carried out on the example of CATERPILLAR mini excavators. However, the model can be dedicated to any company that wants to make decisions in accordance with the idea of sustainable development.",

Although environmental impact assessment is practised in this sector, there is a lack of research dedicated to heavy vehicles. Therefore, the objective was to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of heavy vehicles used in mining (extractive industry) to determine which vehicles have the lowest environmental impact. A life cycle assessment of battery and diesel trucks used in mining was performed. The results of the analysis indicated that electric trucks have a lower environmental impact. However, the method is applicable to the analysis of any vehicle. It can be used by an entity (expert) to select vehicles with the lowest environmental impact in LCA. At the same time, it will be useful in assessing the environmental impact of heavy vehicles, including mining vehicles used in mining.

However, the challenge lies in determining a single, coherent direction for the organization's development to ensure it meets market requirements while simultaneously being environmentally friendly. Therefore, the purpose was to analyse current activities for quality and natural environment making by SMEs from the electromechanical industry from V4 countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) and current customers' satisfaction with the quality of environmentally friendly products. The method of research included survey research among SMEs in the electromechanical industry of V4 countries and their customers or potential customers. In the period from March to July 2023, a research sample of 1,078 respondents was obtained. The U-Mann-Whitney test was used to test the relationship, where the analyses were performed at the significance level of α=0,05. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that the current actions in the area of qualitative-environmental aspects of product improvement by mentioned enterprises are only slightly consistent with current customers' expectations. The originality of the research is that it determines the current direction of development of SMEs from the electromechanical industry from V4 countries with pro-ecological management of product quality, which will be in line with customers' requirements. The results from research can be useful for SMEs from V4 countries, which strive to continuously improve product quality according to the principles of sustainable development.",

Most of the statistics include to tax incomes all obligatory fee of the public sector, which is not based on principles of equivalency. In this case, taxes can be defined as obligatory fees of the public sector, to which governments do not provide direct equal consideration. Modern tax systems are based on the taxation of incomes, consumption, and property. The trend in the area of EU countries taxation is a transition of the tax burden from incomes and capital to consumption. Mainly conditions of mining organisations are presented in the contribution when tax rates and trends in the area of income tax of mining organisations are described. The goal of the contribution is to describe the tax burden of business subjects (mining and extraction organisations) in Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and the Czech Republic. In the contribution, we orientate the research to a detailed analysis of tax rates in chosen countries. The contribution consists of results conclusions, found by analysis, as well as by comparison of the tax burden of V4 business subjects. The result of the problem analysis presents suggestions of the tax mix change and transition to the relatively high tax burden of a job, mainly for low-income employees, to the lower tax burden of high taxes, as for example, environmental taxes. The results are useful for the management of mining organisations, which provide a possibility of financial savings. On the international level, the results serve for the comparing of the financial situation of mining organisations in V4 countries, which is suitable for a determination of raw material states policies.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energy consumption has gained growing importance in the world energy consumption portfolio over recent years. One of the reasons is the increasingly negative development of climate change. The research carried out in this paper aims to discern whether the examined economic indicator (GDP per capita) and the environmental indicator (CO2 emissions per capita) affect the renewable energy consumption in the region of the Visegrad Group (V4 – Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovak Republic) countries, and to draw implications for public administration in the given issue. The fixed effects panel regression model was used to verify the mentioned relationships between variables from 1990-2020. The results show that the level of the share of renewable energy consumption on the total energy consumption in the region of the V4 countries can be affected by the GDP per capita (positive relationship validated) and the CO2 emissions per capita (negative relationship validated). These results are mostly in line with the findings of other researchers conducted on different samples of countries, although some differences can be noted, especially regarding the direction of the relationship. The implications of the research results are presented on three levels: practical implications for the business sector, emphasis placed on political implications for public administration, and theoretical implications that lay the foundation for further research. The main limitation of the research results comes from the sample used in V4 countries and, thus, from the limited possibilities of generalizing the results. The direction of further research in the addressed issue will include a larger number of countries in the research and the use of various quantitative and qualitative research methods.",

The contribution is mapping selected energy and environmental aspects and evaluating renewable energy sources' impact on the environment. At present, energy supply is still mostly provided by sources coming from fossil or nuclear reserves. Although the concept of the \"upper limit of exhaustibility\" of these resources is increasingly used, there are still disagreements between experts in the field of the life expectancy of the reserves. Population growth means higher consumer demands, which also results in higher consumption of energy resources. Environmental degradation has become a global problem that requires the emphasis of recent studies. Non-renewable energy is a significant factor in environmental degradation. Therefore, policymakers have focused on supporting the production and consumption of energy from renewable sources in all economic activities to ensure a low-carbon economy.",

It was shown that increasing the amount of sulfur (1-5 g) had little effect on the process kinetics. In anaerobic bottom sediments, Sulfobacillus (45.7%) and Acidisphaera (32.7%) predominated. Microorganisms showed the fastest reduction activity when glycerol was used as an electron donor. Four weeks of anaerobic-controlled bioreduction of laterites yielded nickel and magnesium at 33.3% and 77.3%, respectively, which could have potential applications in the processing of laterites.",

    "abstract": "EU countries are dependent on the import of many raw materials. The geopolitical situation significantly impacts the European Union's raw materials policy. Hybrid threats are a serious challenge to security and stability in the world. They are very diverse in terms of actors, activities, or tools. The relationship between the EU's raw materials policy and hybrid threats is complex and influenced by a number of factors. In principle, however, it can be said that due to its dependence on importing raw materials from third countries, the EU is more prone to become the object of hybrid threats that these countries can use to promote their interests. The resistance of the public administration to hybrid threats is one of the important factors that can help the EU reduce the risk of threats to raw material policy by hybrid threats. The aim of the contribution is to create a new composite index, KAPA, which measures the resistance of public administration to hybrid threats. The proposed index has five dimensions – cybersecurity, resistance to disinformation, compliance with laws and security, protection against corruption, and prevention of a sovereign debt crisis. When constructing the KAPA index, we start from the apparatus of fuzzy sets. We have drawn all data from reputable, publicly available databases. According to the KAPA index, the countries ranked best are Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The worst-ranked countries were Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Bulgaria, and Croatia. The results confirmed that fragile states, measured by the Fragile States Index FSI, are also more vulnerable to hybrid threats and have less resilient public administration.",

    "abstract": "The heavy machinery used in mining and mineral processing generates significant environmental burdens that cause global warming and also negatively affect human health. This is caused by the use of large amounts of energy by these machines, including the amount of process heat, which generates negative environmental changes. As part of sustainable development, it is necessary to look for more friendly solutions, e.g., life cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, the objective was to analyse the main environmental loads that arise during the extraction and processing of the component materials used in mining machines. In this case, the subject of the research was a reduction gear with a high utilisation rate in excavators and forklifts used in mining. The environmental impact criteria taken into account in the analysis were ozone depletion, human toxicity, and eutrophication. The analysis was carried out using the OpenLCA programme with the ecoinvent database. The results of the analysis showed that in the extraction and processing phase of the reduction gear materials, the main environmental loads arise for selected criteria arise, among others: during coke production, oil and gas extraction, natural gas transport, and hard coal exploitation. The results of the analysis may contribute to the sustainable development of machines in the mining industry and may be useful in the production of new mining machines in order to eliminate their negative impact throughout their life cycle.",

The Jurassic carbonates are targeted in many regions for oil and gas exploration. The current study is carried out to elaborate on the diagenetic alterations and their effect on reservoir properties. A thick outcrop of the Jurassic Samana Suk Formation is studied in the Kahi section of Nizampur Basin Northwest Himalayas, Pakistan, to study and relate the trend of lithological variations and depositional settings. Field investigation revealed that the Samana Suk Formation is extensively distributed in the area and primarily made up of interbedded limestone and dolomite units. The original unaltered limestone has a thick-bedded and oolitic to bioclastic nature. Different types of dolomites have been recognized based on colour contrast and sedimentary features. Moreover, saddle dolomite cement, calcite cementation, and mechanical and chemical compaction have also been observed. The petrographic studies show different types of diagenetic alterations that affected the Samana Suk Formation, including micritization, bioturbation, mechanical and chemical compaction in the form of fractures and stylolites, various calcite cementation, which includes the various cement types that range from isopachous, blocky, granular equant, fibrous, and dog tooth cementation, along with dissolution that occurred in different diagenetic realms. Pyritization was rarely observed. Moreover, different phases of dolomites were identified, ranging in size and shape, i.e., finely crystalline to coarse crystalline and planar euhedral to non-planar anhedral. The stable oxygen isotope values of these dolomites show depletion from original marine signatures and suggest burial-related fault-controlled dolomitization events. Overall, diagenetic processes like dissolution, fracturing and dolomitization increased the reservoir potential. On the contrary, the overburden and cement precipitation result in a decrease in the reservoir properties.",

The series for GDP and Oil prices are quarterly, covering the period from December 1, 2000, to October 1, 2023. Neural network techniques were performed to generate individual forecasts. The forecasts for oil prices maintain higher accuracy than the GDP ones due to autoregressive lags. In other words, current oil prices absorb significant influence from past prices. The GDP forecasts for the V4 group indicate tremendous shock and moving growth to a lower steady state. The lower growth observed by the end of the period under review can be attributed to two subsequent non-economic shocks: the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic. The V4 countries faced difficulties after the outbreak of COVID-19, mainly due to the stringency measures. In addition to accelerating inflation, the war also disrupted energy commodities within supply chains. These and other facts justify the low growth that awaits these countries until 2028. Ultimately, the oil price until 2028 is estimated to oscillate between $60 and $90 per barrel.",

But at the same time, it aims to achieve economic growth. The paper links these two ambitions of the EU. The paper aims to examine the relationship between the GDP and two environmental indicators, namely the government expenditure on environmental protection and the environmental tax revenues in the EU countries. The research uses freely available Eurostat database data and relativizes them by per capita conversion for comparability. Descriptive statistics and fixed effect panel regression models are used in the evaluation. All data for all EU countries from 2014 onwards are evaluated. The results showed that the level of GDP per capita in the European Union countries could be affected by government expenditure on environmental protection per capita (positive relationship validated) and environmental tax revenues per capita (positive relationship validated). The paper presents political implications in two dimensions. The one follows from the double positive effect of government expenditure on environmental protection – contribution to environmental sustainability and economic growth. The second one calls for caution in decision-making by the public authorities based on the interpretation of the positive relationship of environmental tax revenues since their growth may be accompanied by an increase in undesirable activities associated with threats to environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Real estate valuation with mineral deposits in Poland can be conducted using comparative, income, and cost approaches. When determining the value of such real estate, a property valuer must obtain information from multiple sources. These sources not only help to establish the legal status but also allow for determining the type of geological and mining asset of the deposit, characterizing and assessing the quality of the deposit, describing the deposit's resources, and evaluating the exploitation potential. Analysis of the source documentation also enables the assessment of the environmental state post-exploitation and helps determine the external conditions related to the liquidation of deposits after exploitation. The need to include the above information in the appraisal report requires the property valuer to gather a large amount of source information scattered across private and institutional resources. Therefore, this study aims to identify and prioritize the source data necessary for the valuation process of land properties with mineral deposits in Poland using selected business techniques. As part of achieving the research goal, the method of valuing the subject special property will be recognized, and the source materials will be identified. Their prioritization will be performed using two business techniques: the MoSCoW method and the Action Priority Matrix. In the final stage of the study, utility classes of the source materials for the valuation of the subject property will be developed",

However, how the type of collector affects the recovery of coarse particles under microbubbles still needs to be clarified. This study compared the performance and adsorption characteristics of anionic (sodium oleate - NaOL) and cationic (dodecylamine - DDA) collector environments for microbubble-assisted flotation of coarse quartz particles. A two-factorial level and Box-Behnken techniques were used for statistical design for screening and characterizing the performance. The flotation process utilizing NaOL and DDA was not significantly affected by froth depth. In the presence and absence of microbubbles, the performance of DDA surpassed that of NaOL; therefore, the average recovery of the cationic collector was more than 10% higher than that of the anionic collector. Contact angle analysis revealed that NaOL measured approximately 70° while DDA measured around 90°. DDA was adsorbed more significantly than NaOL at the same collector concentration. Zeta potential was more sensitive to DDA; increasing both collector concentrations also increased the value of zeta potential. FT-IR and EDX analyses showed that DDA and NaOL were chemically adsorbed onto quartz. Overall, this study demonstrates that DDA outperformed NaOL in the presence and absence of microbubbles during the flotation of coarse quartz particles.",

    "abstract": "The cross-docking process involves unloading raw materials from incoming vehicles and immediately loading them onto outgoing vehicles. This can greatly improve supply chain operations and expedite transportation to the factory. By minimizing warehouse storage expenses, space requirements, and inventory management, the process can be streamlined effectively. In industries where production profiles need to be responsive to market demands, the location of the cross-docking facility and transportation planning are crucial. This article aims to investigate the criteria for selecting a cross-docking location, using a case study of Arta Profile Company in Ardabil. The research population includes all industrial engineers and production planners in the company, with 10 industry experts selected for this study. The analytic network process (ANP) and grey complex proportional assessment (COPRAS-G) methods were used to compare and prioritize cross-docking locations. Additionally, the fuzzy DEMATEL method was used to determine the strength of connections between different locations. The COPRAS-G approach helps decision-makers make informed decisions by evaluating different options and their importance. The industry experts identified 28 criteria for this study. The results from the network analysis method showed that the most important criterion is the vehicle routing problem (VRP), with a value of 0.46. According to the ANP technique, strategic decision-making is the best option. The fuzzy DEMATEL method revealed that distribution centers are the most important factor, followed by reduced delivery/distribution operations, and finally, the cost of late or early delivery.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed analysis of the Emesent Hovermap ST-X LiDAR scanner's precision in long-distance scanning of underground environments, specifically within the Josef mine's main gallery. The experiment aimed to evaluate the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) capabilities of the Hovermap ST-X over a 750-meter straight tunnel section where conventional geodetic reference points are unavailable. To validate the scanner's accuracy, reference measurements were obtained using a Leica ScanStation P40 terrestrial laser scanner and a Leica MS60 total station, establishing a millimeter-level geodetic network with spherical control targets. The SLAM-based Hovermap ST-X scanner captured point clouds in both single (1P) and double (2P) pass modes, which were then analyzed for systematic errors in transverse (X), longitudinal (Y), and vertical (Z) directions using RMSE metrics. The study finds that while the Hovermap ST-X provides high-precision point clouds within shorter sections, cumulative errors arise over the entire 750-meter distance, particularly in the longitudinal axis, leading to slight compressions that necessitate scale corrections. In the transverse direction, the deviations reach up to tens of centimetres. The study also highlights that double-pass scans effectively reduce transverse deviation errors compared to single-pass measurements, yet significant systematic errors persist in both vertical and horizontal planes. These findings suggest that while SLAM scanning offers rapid data acquisition and adequate accuracy for various applications, its precision for geodetic surveys over extended distances could be improved by integrating scaling transformations and optimized pathing strategies. This work demonstrates the SLAM scanner's utility in challenging underground conditions and provides a framework for future precision assessments in mine surveying. The results suggest practical considerations for enhancing SLAM-based mapping accuracy in geodetic applications, emphasizing the need for periodic control points to minimize cumulative drift errors.",

The energy balance structure is an important element in the economic development of many countries. The diversity of sources used in different countries or continents to produce electricity affects the diversity of the energy balance structure. So far, raw materials are of strategic importance for the energy security of each country and the competitiveness of their economies. Nevertheless, due to their global importance and the introduced directives related mainly to the integration of energy markets and environmental protection, as well as the pace of reduction (shrinking) of the level of their resources, there is a diversification of energy sources resulting from the shift from fossil sources to renewable energy sources. In line with current trends, energy demand (energy consumption, including electricity) is constantly growing, which increases demand for individual energy sources, including solid fuels. The increasing trend in energy demand increases the importance of an appropriate energy balance and, consequently, the energy security of individual countries around the world. The authors of the publication asked the following research question: what may be the future trend in the development of individual energy sources? The authors' attempt to answer was based on the analysis of available data on the amount of electricity produced in the world and the amount of its consumption (consumption). The presented analysis is based on individual regions of the world: North America, S. &amp; Cent. America, Europe, CIS, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.",

    "abstract": "This geological study is devoted to an interesting cognitive issue regarding a large mining problem. A narrow, so-called 'lignite-free' zone occurs in the Tomisławice opencast in central Poland. This surprising disappearance of an exploited lignite seam posed a threat to the proper operation of a nearby Pątnów lignite-fired power plant. Therefore, the Konin Lignite Mine carried out geological studies into the 'lignite-free' area, as designated in the field. During the investigation, it turned out that, in the 'lignite-free' zone, there was, in fact, a continuous lignite seam, but it was at least 11 m lower than the surrounding part of the 'Tomisławice' deposit. This phenomenon can be explained in two ways. First, it could result from greater peat-to-lignite compaction in the zone where the lignite seam is at least twice thicker. Secondly, the zonal lowering of the lignite seam could be caused by post-depositional tectonics, most likely of Quaternary age. The latter hypothesis seems more probable at the current stage of research. Regardless of the reasons for such a large hypsometric lowering of the exploited lignite seam, it is lost to the Konin Lignite Mine. Its extraction is technically possible but would involve lowering the mine water table in the cone depression by at least 11 m. Leaving aside the formal and legal aspects, such action would be too costly and, therefore, lignite from the examined 'lignite-free' zone will remain as mining losses in the Tomisławice deposit.",

Incorporating innovative elements can play a pivotal role in reducing property damage and mitigating health consequences in the aftermath of traffic accidents. The use of the front brake light has, among other benefits, an environmental impact. Its use reduces unnecessary braking and unnecessary acceleration, thus saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from road traffic. This article examines variations in the perceived importance of integrating innovative elements in road traffic concerning the participants' age and frequency of experience with road traffic. A questionnaire was administered to 239 respondents for the research, and statistical hypotheses were tested using non-parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis test; Mann-Whitney test). Three-quarters of the respondents positively view the introduction of the front braking light in road traffic. The results indicate that respondents' age and experience with the front braking light influence their perception of the innovative element, considering it a beneficial idea and perceiving more advantages than disadvantages for its long-term implementation in road traffic. As age and experience with the front braking light increase, the positive perception of its contribution to road traffic safety also rises. However, the age and experience of the respondents with the innovative element did not significantly affect their assessment of its impact on the smooth flow of road traffic.",

According to the relevant literature, the available studies have not been able to successfully link the productivity of CM-based systems to the related independent parameters. However, this study makes an effort to find correlations between a number of independent variables and production-related attributes using regression modelling and curve fitting. A combined relationship was constructed considering all independent parameters as input and production-related parameter as output, and a relationship was made considering each input parameter separately with the production-related parameter as output. The idea of their strong association to represent the interrelationship conveyed by their statistical goodness of fit (R2 and RMSE) and the results of the t-test further support their relevance. The greatest R2 value was shown for seam thickness (0.8779), followed by pillar area (0.84), gradient (0.8112), and coal strength (0.6008). Besides geo-mining input parameters, the cutter motor power has shown a better correlation with production-related parameter, with its corresponding R2 values of 0.8033. The pertinent data from three CM panels (not considered during equations generation) were then incorporated into the derived interrelationships. These validation results were then compared using a t-test to the equivalent actual field data, which revealed a minor discrepancy. The interrelationships were found to be applicable and pertinent in CM–based underground coal mining situations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the proposed article is to examine the issues surrounding the financing of tourism development in the region, with a particular focus on the use of public resources in this area. This may include the use of post-mining areas for sustainable tourism, such as tourist attractions linked to mining history and geology, as well as industrial areas where mining is still ongoing and where existing extractive industry infrastructure can be used to support the development of local tourism. The main objectives of the article are (1) identification and measurement of the perceived extent of issues regarding the financing of tourism development, (2) identification and measurement of the perceived extent of issues regarding the support of tourism development from public sources, and (3) exploration of the relationship between issues concerning the financing of tourism development and issues concerning the support of tourism development from public sources. We relied on scientific literature when identifying the key factors (issues) in financing tourism development in regions. We verified the reliability of the tools created to measure the perceived extent of issues based on McDonald's omega. The primary survey, on which the research results are based, involved 94 experts in regional tourism from Europe. Within the scope of the examined aspects of financing tourism development in the region, the most problematic aspect is perceived to be the support from public sources. This is primarily due to the lengthy process and administrative burden involved in acquiring public funding, as well as the uncertainty associated with obtaining it. According to the research results, these are clearly interconnected issues with the strongest mutual positive correlation. The overall lack of financial resources for tourism development, perceived as the third most acute problem, is attributed by experts to the shortage of public funding at the national level, with almost no consideration for the volume of public funding at the European level.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of rapid urbanization and uncontrolled construction on Kopaonik mountain in Serbia. Kopaonik is known for its natural beauty and winter sports attractions, but in recent years, it has experienced a significant increase in urbanization. The paper analyzes the current state of urbanization in Kopaonik, including the increase in the number of building permits, the number of built buildings, and the increase in tourist capacities. Environmental challenges and infrastructural problems arising from rapid urbanization are also discussed. This paper also explores the dilemmas between the economic benefit brought by tourism and the need to preserve nature. The author investigates the views and concerns of citizens regarding urbanization through a survey. The survey results provide insight into different perspectives and dilemmas regarding this topic. Also, the role of the Kopaonik National Park and local authorities in controlling urbanization is considered. Kopaonik National Park emphasizes the need to stop further construction to preserve nature, while the local self-government of the municipality of Raška advocates controlled urbanization that will support the region's economic development. Through this analysis, the paper explores the key aspects of urbanization in Kopaonik, providing insight into the complexity of the challenges and the need for a balance between economic benefit and nature conservation in this beautiful mountain area.",

    "abstract": "Poznamky k odhadu rizika opustenej bane The authors give some remarks to the term risk regarding its use for the assessment of abandoned mine sites. These remarks are based on the recommendation Geotechnical Investigation and Evaluation of Abandoned Mine Sites developed by the working committee Abandoned Mining of the German Society for Geotechnical Engineering (DGGT) and the German Society for Mine Surveying (DMV), published in 2004. By this recommendation, the risk is defined as a product of the occurrence probability and the extent of damage of an unwanted event. The occurrence probability for each unwanted event is described by the linguistic terms in all probability, probable, less probable or practically impossible. The extent of damage for each unwanted event is described by the linguistic terms insignificant, small, high or very high. A matrix out of these terms is used to define schematically an explicit limiting risk for each unwanted event. The authors point out that a schematic determination of limiting risk should be supported by an unique and comprehensible evaluation of all significant risk factors and parameters influencing the extent of damage. Fuzzy sets can be used instead of a discreet classification leading to more plausible results. The processing of linguistic terms by a fuzzy logic system is demonstrated. The opencast and in-situ mining were done in Germany since mid age. These mining activities lead to thousands of near to surface cavities. The stability of mining excavations is affected continuously by anthropogenic and natural effects. Possible damages contain more or less a potential of risk for peoples and objects. A systematic investigation and assessment of abandoned mine sites and occurred damages as well as a determination of the potential of risk are essential for an effective safeguard and sustainable clean-up. Therefore, systematic and unique criteria of treating the measurements are necessary for acting experts from mining authorities and consultants. These criteria are a part of recommendations developed and published by the common working committee Abandoned Mining of the German Society for Geotechnical Engineering (DGGT) and the German Society for Mine Surveying (DMV). These recommendations contain definitions important for regulating the responsibility and the liability (Meier et al. 2004). The term Abandoned Mining means the entirety of mining excavations and drillings as well as open casts, dumps, tips and residual holes, which are no longer used for mining activities. Other mined excavations which were never used for mining purposes, like e.g. beer or wine cellars, antiaircraft-galleries and tunnels, should be treated like mining excavations. The area of influence due to abandoned mine sites means an area whose characteristics or functions are influenced negatively by abandoned mining or a future influence can not be excluded. The borderline of this area has to be determined under a consideration of the former mining situation, the geotechnical and tectonic conditions as well as the soil and rock mechanical characteristics of the overlying strata. Abandoned mine sites in Germany are related to several kinds of former mining, e.g. ore mining, uranium mining, copper mining, hard coal mining, lignite mining, pit and quarry industry, potash mining as well as salt mining. The extent of potential hazard areas is different, depending on the kind and intensity of the former mining. E.g., probably 75 % of the urban area of Saxony is affected by the abandoned mining, 2.300 notifications of damage are registered for the former uranium mining, 3000-4000 shafts for the copper mining are notified in the area of 200 km² around the cities of Mansfeld and Sangershausen and within the Ruhr Basin 60.000 hazard areas are notified mostly related to the hard coal mining (Busch et al., 2005b). Recommendations of the Treatment The development and allocation of a state-of-the-art guideline for the geotechnical investigation and assessment of roof stability of mining excavations and stability of strata in the surrounding of old mining openings were a main target of the recommendation. The geotechnical investigation and assessment means an interdisciplinary analysis of the available information about the abandoned mine site, the geological 1",

    "abstract": "The risk assessment determines threats that could appear during the execution of production system goals. Thus, manufacturing companies need to evaluate and react to the risk as well as it is possible. Due to the complexity and variable character of the mining system, as well as different types of parameters obtained at subsequent stages of the horizontal transport process, the risk was assessed according to various methods. Three stages were distinguished in the horizontal transport system of copper ore studied in the paper: tyre haulage of the shot copper ore to the transfer point, the so-called grate, transferring the output to belt conveyors and crushing solid rock into smaller pieces; transport on belt conveyors. Risk factors have been characterized for each stage. To assess the risk of the loading and haulage processes, an ANN model was built to predict the amount of ore extracted. A general linear neural network model was also built to confirm the results of the correlation analysis. One of the methods recommended for risk assessment in manufacturing companies is the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), which allows for calculating the risk and prioritizing it. The FMEA method allows identifying only these elements of the production system that are the most sensitive to the impact of risk factors. For the next stages of the horizontal transport process, the risk was assessed according to the FMEA method. The risk levels at each stage were different. Production systems are composed of many elements that create the reliability structure of this system. Unfortunately, the FMEA method does not allow for analyzing the reliability structure of the production system. Therefore, the new idea presented in this paper is a method of total risk assessment of the horizontal transport system of copper ore, which does take its reliability structure into account. The currently used methods of risk analysis and assessment do not take into consideration the reliability structure of the production system. The proposed method can be applied for risk assessment in other production systems characterized by a diversified structure.",

    "abstract": "Shearers and roadheaders are commonly used to extract useful mineral deposits, especially hard coal, and for drilling roadways in underground mines, tunnels and other underground buildings in civil engineering. As the primary working process of this type of machines, mechanical mining of rocks is carried out by cutting. These machines' working units are equipped for this purpose with picks, usually conical (point-attack). They have the form of an axially symmetrical body consisting of a steel shaft and a tip usually made of tungsten carbide, connected by a hard brass solder. Due to the possibility of spontaneous rotation in the pick holders and even wear and tear of their tip around the entire perimeter, conical picks have a much longer service life compared to radial picks. Their life, especially when cutting hard and sharp abrasive rocks, is, however, still unsatisfactory. Rapid wear of the picks leads to a decrease in mining efficiency, an increase in this process's energy consumption, and an increase in dynamic surplus to which the cutting machine is subject. Among many forms of wear and tear of the conical picks, attention was paid to the problem of asymmetrical abrasive wear of the tips, pulling out the connection of the soldered pick tip and fatigue breaking of the pick shafts in the transition zone of the shank into the shoulder. The article presents original propositions of modification of the construction of the roadheaders/shearers conical pick shafts and the method of fixing the tip in the pick shaft in order to increase their operational durability significantly. The technologies and devices necessary to manufacture conical picks of the proposed structure were described. The developed modifications significantly contribute to the improvement of functional properties, including the reliability of conical picks, used in particular for hard rock mining.",

    "abstract": "Although quality management systems are discussed in the professional field, methodological recommendations guiding modification processes related to the integration or conversion of standardized quality management systems are absent in both scientific and professional circles. The presented paper reflects on these facts and offers an instance of the development and application of a new methodology that would help in decision-making processes in companies. Although the authors' methodology is presented in the context of educational institutions, given the aim of ISO 9001 and the need for changes in the sectors related to ensuring increasingly high-quality processes in companies, this methodology can also be applied in the mining industry, the manufacturing sector and service sector. The Slovak Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (SAAHE) issued new quality standards for Slovak universities in 2020 (SAAS 2020). The previous accreditation rules determined requirements and criteria for quality management system (QMS) implementation, maintenance and improvement. Therefore, some Slovak universities implemented ISO 9001 in the past. It is necessary to convert their QMS from ISO 9001 to SAAS 2020. The main objectives of this paper are: to identify selected common requirements of both standards, to define three basic dimensions of QMS conversion, to use vector analysis for quantifying conversion relevance (CR) and conversion strength (CS) and to recommend which requirement should be preserved or converted. Conversion is vector AB, where initial position A = (Ax, Ay, Az) represents ISO 9001 and the new position B = (Bx, By, Bz) represents SAAS 2020.",

Lean Management aims at streamlining the flow of value while continually seeking to reduce the resources required to produce a given set of products.

The relationship between Industry 4.0 and Lean Management has been increasingly evidenced in operations management research. To create a better understanding, the main point of interest for this work is to investigate the link and integration between Industry 4.0 and Lean Management, as well as examine its implications on performance and the environmental factors influencing these relationships in some companies especially focusing on the mining industry. Based on the literature review, a questionnaire was created about Lean Management and Industry 4.0, which was applied in some companies in Brazil and Hungary, most of them from the mining industry. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the application of combining both methodologies, Lean Management and Industry 4.0. The unique contribution of the paper is to see the common areas of Lean and Industry 4.0 where there are research and knowledge, but the application level at the companies is low.",

    "abstract": "The undiminished importance of international technology transfer (ITT) consistently attracts attention from scientists, businesses, and governments. The OECD acknowledges the benefits of the ITT and emphasises that European countries should be open to new opportunities that ITT brings in each economic sector, from primary to tertiary. The mining sector does not represent an exception. ITT contributes to job creation and growth worldwide by creating new markets and expanding existing ones. ITT transforms human fifes and surrounding very quickly. The TT improves production efficiency, stimulates growth; reformats patterns of sectors; brings new opportunities to every capital owner, and improves economic well-being among people worldwide. At the same time, it changes the value system and, in many cases, seriously harms the environment. Despite the researchers' focus on ITT, more complex research still needs to assess the factors of such phenomena. The article contributes to creating a more comprehensive methodology for evaluating the ITT environment not only in the mining sector but also in the other field of the primary sector. For analysis, the authors use popular Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) methods and develop objective methods for criteria weights calculation. The study evaluates and compares internal conditions for OECD Northern Europe countries to implement, develop and share technologies. For this purpose, a set of 16 quantitative criteria was created; their hierarchical structure with four categories was set. A detailed comparative analysis of the state of the countries in terms of favourable conditions for the ITT was performed.",

    "abstract": "Effective ways of reducing harmful emissions in the energy sector include, in particular, increasing the efficiency of energy conversion from non-renewable energy sources, the wider use of renewable energy sources and on the other hand, the rational use of energy by consumers. This study deals with the application of renewable energy sources (green energy), which, in addition to environmental benefits, also increase the state's independence from the import of fossil fuels. The world trend is clearly moving towards more intensive use of these clean green energies. Therefore, their higher use is included among the strategic goals of energy policy in most countries of the world, in EU countries, including Slovakia. The paper aims to examine the most important renewable energy sources producing green energy in the EU-27 member states in the period of 2010-2020. The subject of the research is the indigenous production of geothermal energy, solar thermal energy, primary solid biofuels, biogases, and renewable municipal waste. The analyzed EU countries differ in the most important renewable energy production. The countries of northern Europe are the Union leaders in producing energy from waste. Italy is a leader in the use of geothermal energy. The countries of northern Europe, including the Baltic States, are making progress in the production of solar energy. The cluster analysis resulted in the identification of countries with similar characteristics in the case of the development of domestic production of selected renewable sources in the examined period. The analysis showed the development of indicators had not changed significantly over the last decade, although some countries have moved within the established clusters.",

Results of research on the Triassic limestone samples using this method are presented there. The samples were taken from the area of Opole Silesia in Poland. It is a Polish part of the Germanic Basin. X-ray diffraction was used to identify the following phases: low-Mg calcite, high-Mg calcite, dolomite, and huntite. Low-Mg calcite dominates in the limestones. In some samples, there is also a lower amount of high-Mg calcite. Moreover, dolomite and huntite were identified. The study results have shown that X-ray diffraction is the perfect method to identify carbonate phases with different magnesium content. Limestone, including carbonates rich in magnesium, can be used as a fertilizer, animal feed additive, sorbent to desulfurize flue gases or material in road building. The research results indicate the possibility of application of the Muschelkalk limestones rich in magnesium from the area of Opole Silesia in different branches of industry. Therefore, it would not be necessary to carry out selective exploitation in a way to avoid the magnesium-rich limestone zones in the deposits.",

    "abstract": "The research aims to construct a novel secure regional development index focusing on ecological security aspects of eight Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The index building is based on the Sustainable Development (SD) Security Model that measures ecological threats' harm to the regional ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to construct a tool to manage facets of sustainable regional development. The research study is focused on G20 countries. The databank of the World Bank organisation was utilised to get secondary data of selected security indicators to measure security for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the G20. The methodological approach relies on grouping ecological security indicators (Clustering using the K-Means method). It suggests a meaningful shortlist of indicators in each group, which would obtain a structured system of indicators suitable for constructing a novel Secure Regional Development Index using the multiple criteria decision-making TOPSIS method that selects the best alternative from a set of alternatives according to several criteria.",

    "abstract": "The total station is the most basic geodetic measuring instrument, locally the most accurate and versatile. Its accuracy is the cornerstone of its use and is defined by the standard deviations of horizontal direction, zenith angle and slope distance measurements. These accuracy parameters are given by the manufacturer, but these are only valid under optimum measurement conditions. To ensure the credibility and reliability of the measurements, these values must be periodically ascertained or determined for atypical measurement configurations or measurement conditions. Standardised procedures are used for this purpose, but in our opinion, they do not reflect the full influence of the measuring conditions and other measuring aids. A comprehensive determination of the accuracies (variation components) from the alignment, where all possible influences in a given situation are applied, may be considered the most appropriate for determining the angular accuracy of measurements. Such atypical conditions are certainly represented by geodetic measurements in the confined spaces of an underground mine. Thus, an experimental determination of the accuracy of four different robotic total stations was carried out at the Center of experimental geotechnics in a mine Josef teaching centre (CTU in Prague), and the Fӧrstner method was used to determine the variation components. A network of 6 stations and 8 target points was designed. The grid size was approximately 32x21 m with 4 - 31 m lengths. A network with the same configuration was also duplicated at the surface to assess whether the accuracy is different in underground and how the results will correspond to the accuracy claimed by the manufacturers. The result of the testing is that the accuracy claimed by the manufacturers is maintained even under such difficult measurement conditions in narrow corridors and with short sights. The overall evaluation also found that the accuracy achieved underground and on the surface is identical, although it varies from instrument to instrument.",

    "abstract": "In an era of increasing efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, black coal creates many problems, primarily because it is a fuel used solely for burning that contaminates the environment. In countries in Central Eastern Europe, a safe and successful transition from energy produced from coal requires societal changes, as well as public and private financing. The aim of this study is to examine and better understand how different psychological factors influence young citizens' intention to engage in activities directed at coal energy reduction financially. In our pilot study, we enlisted respondents from the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia because the analysis of the main sources of energy generation in these countries provided evidence that they are behind in embracing the European Commission's strategy and meeting the renewable energy sources target. Based on a questionnaire survey, we found that Central Eastern European citizens' intention to pay higher taxes to reduce energy use from coal was moderate. Using Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, we also found that only two variables, attitude, and subjective norms, are strong determinants of environmental intentions for young Central Eastern European citizens. In addition, our study is the first to include personal responsibility as a consideration in coal energy reduction. Our extension of the theory of planned behavior with personal responsibility indicates the enormous role of the postulated environmental protection policies and media campaigns in promoting environmental awareness among young citizens.",

    "abstract": "The use of in-situ soil testing has become popular in many geotechnical projects because of its high measurement accuracy and low disturbance of the soil sample during the testing process.Pressuremeter Test (PMT) and standard penetration test (SPT) are two important in-situ tests in geotechnical engineering.The former is an expensive and time-consuming experiment that can measure some detailed mechanical properties of soil while the latter is lowcost and can estimate some basic soil specifications.Thus, identifying the relationship between PMT and SPT parameters can help improve the mechanical characterization of soil samples through a cost-saving methodology.In this research, 47 SPT and 47 PMT were performed on very stiff and hard silty clay and clay soil samples.The variation range of E PMT and the N 60 are in the range of 16.55-75.95MPa and 16-51, respectively.Empirical equations were proposed between E PMT -N 60 , P L -N 60 , and E PMT -P L with R 2 ≥ 0.65.Regression analysis by determining 'R 2 ', 'Sig.', and 'F' values demonstrated that the proposed models are highly significant and strongly meaningful.The Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for each relation showed that the estimation error is very small, and the relationships are acceptable.The equations proposed in this research can be used for very stiff and hard silty clay and clay soil types.Also, by comparing the N 60 and E PMT /P L values, silty clay and clay soil were classified in terms of consistency according to E PMT /P L ratio.Finally, the results from this study were grouped and compared with those reported earlier, leading to a practical advisory methodology for the estimation of PMT parameters from the SPT data applicable to a wide range of soil samples.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of changes to the scope of statutory auditor’s reporting has become a starting point to take the issue into consideration in the international literature on possibilities to limit an audit expectation gap i.e. an information expectation gap with regard to an audit. Its partial limitation has become possible owing to a new audit reporting which should be a valuable source of independent information for stakeholders with Key Audit Matters (KAMs). They are the issues most significant while auditing a financial statement of a given company for a current period. The higher number of KAMs revealed by a statutory auditor may suggest a higher number of problem areas in an audited company's activity. This paper aims to determine the factors that influence the number of KAMs that auditors disclose in their audit reports on the financial statements of European mining companies. Sixty-two companies from the mining industry, listed on European stock exchanges and taken into consideration on the ORBIS basis, were taken for the research sample. The content analysis included financial statements and statutory auditors’ reports for the year 2019. The authors formulated the main hypotheses, according to which: The number of KAMs reported in the auditor's reports from auditing the financial statements of mining companies is positively associated with the size of the audited company (H1) and the amount of the audit fee (H2). The research on the practice of KAM reporting allowed to identify the most problematic areas existing in the companies of the mining branch, which include: investments in related entities, property and tangible assets, provisions and contingencies. The verification of the suggested research hypotheses allowed to state that in the case of the companies of the mining sector, the higher number of reported KAMs is not connected with the number of these companies' assets, but the scale of their activity, expressed with the number of incomes. The relationship between the number of KAMs and an amount of an audit fee was also confirmed. The added value of the conducted research of KAM reporting practice is a possibility to use the results in the practice of the activity of mining companies. The review of the most frequent KAMs provides a general opinion on specific problems existing, according to the authors, in companies operating businesses in this branch. The authors notice limitations of the research resulting from the adopted research sample and a need to conduct next studies, which will be connected with the in-depth analysis of the scope and the type of disclosed KAMs as well as their changes in the next reporting periods.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the research was to assess the impact of a new structure of human capital on high value-added economic sectors in European countries. The conducted theoretical and empirical research has shown that the proposed new concept of human capital has a place to be. Three dimensions of human capital, such as quality, quantity and value, have different impacts on different sectors of European economies. Based on empirical data, the multiple linear regression model was chosen as a method that the best-fit structure of the data collected. The proposed econometric model revealed that the value of human capital is the most important component among three having very close statistical interconnections with qualitative dimensions. It was researched that Scandinavian countries scored the highest level of value dimension of human capital as well as high value-added in the economy. Open, trusted, tolerant, culturally diverse societies create preconditions for a rise for creative culture, which is a source for the formation of technological innovations and adaptation in high value-added economic sectors. Moreover, because of this value-added chain, technological innovations penetrate traditional industries as mining brings the reduction of cost, the increase in productivity and value-added, safety, and shared value in society through environmental issues.",

The Tokaj wine region can be found on the world heritage list of UNESCO. Although there were several mineral prospecting activities at the Tokaj Mountains in the 1960s and 1970s, the groundwater resources on a regional scale have not been revealed yet. The regional water budget and the groundwater flow systems were not known before the complex hydrogeological investigations recently carried out by the University of Miskolc. Although shallow groundwater is being produced at some small-scale waterworks to cover local drinking water demands, it has believed that there is no chance to find thermal water and to extract underground heat in this volcanic area because of the average hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface formations is very low. It is encouraging that intensive tectonic lines were determined by geophysical methods during the recent field campaigns. The presence of valuable thermal water resources was discovered along these tectonic lines opening new perspectives in geothermal exploration in this region. After the extensive field measurements, a regional scale groundwater-flow model was constructed to characterize the subsurface flow systems and the available shallow and deep groundwater resources of the Tokaj Mountains. A special prospecting methodology involving geological, hydrogeological and surface geophysical methods was elaborated to find thermal water resources in this complex geological/ecological environment.",

    "abstract": "The problems of the development of mineral deposits related to the technologies of extraction, transportation and processing of viscous, gaseous and bulk materials, including in mixed fractions, are analysed. To solve the problem of efficient transport technologies, a combination of electromagnetic effects with a bionic approach based on the use of the principles of motion dynamics of dolphins, fish and amphibians with a wave-like swimming method is proposed. The purpose of the study is to develop a structural, object-oriented mathematical model of a channel-type wave electromechanical converter that provides transportation and processing of minerals in liquid, viscous, gaseous and mixed fractions. It is noted that in this case, the existing methods of development and calculation of traditional electric drives are not suitable since the electromagnetic core must have a different spatial arrangement and have a distributed structure, the configuration of which is individual. The construction of a structural bionic model of an electromechanical system is based on the use of a system of travelling wave equations with fixed ends and the principles of the genetic concept in electromechanics. By directional application of genetic and geometric operators to flat and cylindrical forms of electromagnetic field sources, populations of a flow channel and combined structures connected to the ends of a travelling wave are obtained. An object-oriented mathematical model, methodology and algorithm for calculating a multi-motor electromechanical converter integrated into the design of a transport wave system have been developed. The optimal ratios of copper and steel of the electromagnetic core, the geometric dimensions of the flow channel and the number of switched electromagnetic modules providing energetically efficient generation of a travelling wave in the channel are established. The study's theoretical significance lies in the fact that the results obtained can be used in the development of technologies and the design of devices for the transportation and processing of liquid, viscous, gaseous, bulk materials and mixed fractions in the mining industry and in other areas.",

While inclined and steep coal seam strata in the pillars are widely exploited with land-and-cost intensive deepening longitudinal mining method, this article substantiates the choice of modification of block-and-layer continuous lateral mining method for different kinds of coal deposits. The aim of the study is to specify the modifications of the method proposed, define the stages of their carrying out, and emphasize the advantages over deepening longitudinal method of coal pillars surface mining. The basic principle of the proposed continuous lateral method of mining the coal pillars is limiting the final depth of quarry by the vertical height of the first floor of the underground mine workings. The continuous lateral mining method is detailed in the article in three modifications (for development coal seams strata of high and medium thickness, as well as distanced separate coal seams), which advantages are low land intensity and dust emission from the dump. Attention is also paid to the economic benefits of the block-and-layer continuous lateral method of mining coal pillars of closed mines, whereby the overburden transporting costs can be significantly reduced, while limitations of the proposed mining method concern specific sites of closed mines that make up a small part of the coal pillars extracted by surface mining today.",

In fact, measuring business cycles is critical in determining the stylized facts on the cyclical behavior of aggregate macroeconomic indicators over time. As green growth topics started to occupy much academic interest, the question of the co-existence of equitable and sustainable development as well as current dynamics and cyclical features of economic growth comes into foreplay. This paper aims to evaluate cyclical characteristics of green growth related variables by observing two countries that showed different green policy aspirations over time, namely China and France. Following the paper's main objective, we want to provide a detailed analysis of the extent to which Green GDP and relevant output measures are comparable in a wider 'deviation cycle' context that includes cycle correlation, cycle coherence, and cycle magnitude. Results suggest that business cycles of GDP/GNI and Green GDP are strongly connected and coherent to a high degree. However, we found that the strength of that nexus and the degree of similarity has changed considerably over time, yet in a positive way.",

The base of mineral raw materials provides in the frame of certain regions the value that is possible to evaluate with optimal use complexly, and by this way profit for the owner, state and mining company, as well as single region is created. The goal of the presented contribution is to search for a position of raw material using in industries and its trend from the view of growth rate, in connection to the growth of other industries with the aim to provide long-term prosperity and contribution of industries to the national economy. Research had been done through growth rate of sales and revenues and one-way analysis of sales trend in analyzed period 2009-2018. The research is supported by initial decline analysis, orientated to the evaluation of positive and negatives of raw material using generally. According to the internal analysis, there are selected sectors directly connected to the mining industry. The results show there is the stable or improving character of the mining industry, which is very similar to industrial production, having influence with other industrial sectors. There is a recorded trend in the growth of individual industries, which varies significantly. The results of the contribution are useful in providing long-term prosperity and contribution of industries to the national economy, providing sustainable economic growth. The contribution is limited to the evaluation of industries growth from the view of sales and revenues, and future research can be extended to the evaluation from the view of market share, etc. Future research can also be extended to other macro-economic indicators, influencing the competitiveness of the mining industry and its sustainable tendency.",

    "abstract": "Optimalization of the contours of the Kongora open surface pit, applying the Method of movable slopes (l) has been elaborated in the Master thesis Projecting in the mining by applying application programs [10]. In the basic proposition of the Method of movable slopes, fix values of the energy market prices and the elementary prices of mineral raw material digging, have been taken into consideration for the reason of simplified procedure in verifying the method in the course of elaborating the algorithms [9, 10]. According to the algorithms of contemporary methods, a process of projecting surface pit mines includes also determination of blocks digging seguences [14]. It includes an exact defining of optimal opening point and the direction of developing surface pit. The change of the exploitation price is considerably influenced by the factors such as - the place of opening, the way of digging, direction of advancing and some additional investments [1]. Formerly determined final contours of the surface pit might serve as an ultimate goal of optimalization. An exact sequence of technological operations should be determined to be able to reach the established goal [4, 5]. The point of opening and developing of the surface pit is greatly influenced by the following factors: value of the mineral raw material (economic factor), shape of ore body, quality of the mineral raw material and the quantity of the overburden (natural and technological factors) as well as the morphology of the ground. Inside any surface pit mine there is tendency of continuity in sense of profit but also with regard to really possible technological solutions. It means that a crucial problem is to achieve constant quality of mineral raw material, quality of overburden and the form of mining works [2, 3, 6]. Following these propositions, a contemporary method of determination an optimal point of opening and developing of the surface pit has been elaborated, primarily for the stratified deposits as well as for the other types of deposits, nominated as the Method of uniformed ratio (MUR). This method has been tested on the representative example of the Kongora coal mine pit.",

    "abstract": "The article describes issues related to the development of a sensor measuring the distance from the end of the shield support canopy to the face of the longwall panel. The sensor's task is to detect rock falls because in such a case, empty spaces in the coal seam below the roof are generated. The sensor is a part of the system which task is to predict unfavourable behaviour of the longwall roof affecting the continuity of mining. Due to an untypical workplace and difficult conditions prevailing there, it was not possible to use a typical sensor. The ultrasonic technique was used for this purpose. The next research stages related to the development of the sensor were described. Tests of various types of ultrasonic transducers, working at different parameters, were described. Only transducers with a closed structure were considered because they can operate in the presence of high dustiness and humidity. The sensor casing was adapted to a specific type of shield support. The installation location should not be accidental, as an additional hinged shield is mounted at the end of the canopy, which is an obstacle in the measuring track and can even completely cover it, making measurements impossible. The sensor is mounted close to the side edge of the shield support canopy using small free space, enabling a measurement. Structural elements of the canopy are obstacles in the measuring track and are a source of interference of the received signals. The ultrasonic transducers are built-in tubes, which direct the ultrasonic wave and amplify the received signals. The results of laboratory tests of the model of the path measurement sensor are presented. They describe the impact of analysed aspects, i.e. the type of transducers used, the structure of the surface that the wave is reflected from and the mechanical solutions on the quality of received signals. A prototype of a sensor installed on shield support is presented.",

    "abstract": "Coal dust and methane explosions are some of the most common causes of mining disasters in hard coal mines all over the world, and research continues to be conducted with the purpose of understanding the mechanisms of an explosion, explosion prevention and risk reduction. This article presents the test methodology as well as virtual and bench test results for a braking unit, which constitutes one of the main components of a suspended monorail transport system. The design work and virtual and bench testing were performed as part of a European research programme. The tests were conducted in a dedicated specialist test facility. The tests were based on Polish standard PN-G-46860:2011, concerning braking trolleys employed in mining plant suspended railway systems. The tests also factored in the requirements for non-electrical devices intended for use in explosive atmospheres, including braking systems, as defined in standard PN-EN ISO 80079-36:2016, harmonised with the ATEX directive. The test scope encompassed braking unit operational component temperature measurements using thermal imaging and the contact method, as well as braking distance measurements. Further tests involved virtual simulations of brake pad heating. The tests employed the finite element method (time-varying calculations). Results obtained over the course of numerical calculations indicate that brief brake pad friction face heating, even up to a temperature exceeding 200C, does not result in inward heat propagation towards the brake pad material. This is also confirmed by the measurement results. However, under real conditions, the braking unit would be engaged only during an emergency situation, which would not lead to exceeding the permissible brake shoe material temperature values.",

    "abstract": "Decreasing pollution and increasing oil fields profitability are key goals of the proper extraction of hydrocarbons from oil-associated gas (OAG).Despite the potential of a proper OAG utilization, oil companies often struggle with an increase in the overall gas cost and possible unprofitability of its treatment though conventional methods (Igitkhanyan et al., 2014).These cost-related issues have been mentioned before by authors like Braginskii and Chernavskiito (2011) and Arutyunov et al. (2017).This paper introduces a novel method for OAG separation and the subsequent obtention of the Broad Fraction of Light Hydrocarbons (BFLH) that relies on compression followed by the cooling.The proposal is implemented on a mobile laboratory unit developed to define power expenditures and optimize the modes of obtaining broad fractions of hydrocarbons from OAG at oil fields with low gas factor and caloricity due to high nitrogen content.The experiments of the paper contributed validating the proposed method and the mobile unit, and this, among others, by determining optimal modes for the obtention of the BFLH from AOG with different initial compositions of hydrocarbons components and harmful admixtures, and also by determining concrete values for the dependence of the OAG compression pressure on temperature.",

    "abstract": "Pre-Carpathian Downfold is an important strategic centre for the extraction of potassium salts.The unique ratios of salt minerals found within its deposits have no analogues in the world.And the obtained, of their processing, high-quality products have always been in high demand.However, the primary resources of the largest deposits were almost depleted more than a decade ago, and the formed post-mining territories became a source of accumulation of negative environmental impacts.To cover the current national demand and to increase Ukraine's competitiveness in the world market, it is necessary to process secondary sources containing salt components such as tailings, storage tanks, sludge storage.A new approach and especially more efficient technological procedures are needed for balancing economic and environmental indicators and the brine processing of these secondary sources.From an environmental and economic point of view, membrane technologies use is considered to be more appropriate than old brine evaporation systems.This work investigates the possibilities of such processing regarding brines of the Dombrowsky quarry of Kalush-Golinsky deposit.According to the results, advantageous key financial indicators of the simulated project were obtained.The results of the study are described with respect to the possibility of implementing such an approach for solving a set of environmental and economic tasks, such as stabilizing the level of environmental security and increasing the macroeconomic performance of the country.",

    "abstract": "The aim of geological field mapping is to collect and interpret data on the relief of the Earth's surface. From thus created geological maps, we can obtain information about mineral units and their structure – rock and mineral types, their thickness, lithological deposits, faults, folds, fractures, and thus interpret information as they originated over time. However, the accessibility of such structures is affected by various morphological elements – terrain notches, watercourses, but also by vegetation. Simultaneous geodetic and geological mapping could be a solution for surveying hardly accessible morphological structures. Non-contact surveying technologies – terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and close-range photogrammetry (terrestrial and remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) photogrammetry) provide reliable, high-quality and accurate data on the topographic surface with a high temporal resolution, as the spatial accuracy of the measured point can be mXYZ ≤ 10 mm at an imaging distance of about 20 – 30 m. From the measured data, it is possible to generate point clouds, digital terrain models, and orthophoto maps based on automated data processing. However, the disadvantage of photogrammetric imaging is a proportional decrease in accuracy with increasing imaging distance. The accuracy of TLS is not significantly affected by increasing distance. The paper presents a case study of the use and comparison of non-contact surveying technologies and their application for in-situ mapping of hardly accessible geological structures in the area of Spišská Magura (Slovak-Polish border). The results are given for two localities on two outcrops - Jurgów (PL) and Bachledova valley (SK), while analyzing the usability of TLS and RPAS photogrammetry, with and without the use of artificial ground control points (GCP). The paper presents a mutual comparison of all obtained graphical outputs in terms of 1D and 2D quality depending on the type of GCPs used, depending on the terrain and accessibility. The results show that by using photogrammetry when creating map data, in comparison with TLS, we are able to get sufficient accuracy of outputs for in-situ geological mapping.",

Until now, it has been assumed in the literature that n=1 and no attention has been paid to the mechanism of the intrinsic chemical reaction.In this work, the value of n=0.22 was calculated for the solutions with \"low\" HNO concentration, and n=0.05 was obtained for the concentrated HNO solutions.These values of n are considerably lower than the value of n=0.5, predicted by the theory.It is hypothesised that the decrease in n with increased acid concentration might be related to the formation of CO 2 and its transfer from the liquid to the ga phase.",

The purpose of the study was to identify the best mining practices in Canada. The paper contains an overview of the laws and procedures regulating the mining industry in Canada as well as the procedures for enforcing environmental and safety regulations. The procedures for changing and constantly updating the safety regulations are also being discussed. This was also done for the purpose of identifying the best practices. The article also addresses the procedure for investigating mining accidents in Canada. The article emphasizes the importance of a three-way partnership (management of the mining company, labor union, and the Ministry of Labor). That three-way partnership is important from the perspective of revising and modifying the mining safety regulations as well as enforcing those regulations. Participation of the labor union as well as the management of the mining company in updating safety regulations makes them more practical and reflective of real safety issues. Unpractical and obsolete mine safety regulations are being eliminated. The labor union and mine management feel the ownership of the mining safety regulations. This fact makes it easier to enforce new regulations. The article also focuses on environmental protection procedures. Environmental risk evaluation is conducted before a mining permit is issued. This is being done by the provincial government. During the mining operation, the Ministry of Labor is handling the environmental protection issues. The Ministry of Labor is constantly checking the compliance with the safety as well as the environmental and sustainability guidelines. Using artificial intelligence and Industry 4.0 technology is also being mentioned.",

    "abstract": "Due to the current ecological situation in the world, the demand for renewable energy is growing. Its use does not burden the environment because resources are renewed in a short time, unlike traditional fuels - coal or oil. It can be concluded that the main task of humanity is to choose the appropriate technology for obtaining renewable energy and adapt it to local conditions. The aim of the work is to present the technical, economic and environmental potential of using the wave energy of the Baltic Sea and the possibility of converting this energy into electricity. The theoretical and technical potential of sea wave energy that Poland could use was estimated. The most advanced methods of converting wave energy into electricity were presented, and the most promising technical solutions were selected for use in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone and off the coast of our country. The selection of the most promising technologies - single and combined wave energy converters was based on reports on the operation of the first experimental wave power plants and wave converters operating in other waters. In terms of technology and economics, obtaining energy from sea waves is much more difficult than using solar or wind energy. However, along with the development of offshore wind farms and access to the infrastructure of the National Power System and the need to give up traditional, emission-related energy sources, wave power plants may have a chance for development in the Polish energy sector. It is an untapped source of renewable energy with great energy potential.",

    "abstract": "When discussing historic structures, a significant problem is how to preserve and protect these structures. The presented paper deals with some issues of the unfavourable impact of industrial activity on some historic structures. Long-term influences from the industrial activity are one of the common sources of damage observed in these structures. Due to the size and volume of such structures, they are characterized by very low resistance to vibration and ground deformations. At the same time, the high cultural and material value of historic structures necessitates their costly protection and repair. Knowing the origin of problems, one may take proper actions to protect them. This paper discusses two important types of impact typical for industrial areas, especially affected by mining, seismically induced vibrations and continuous ground deformations from underground extraction. The presented discussion is based on the case study examples of historical sites located in some industrial areas in the Czech Republic and Poland. They point to different sources of damage to those structures that may arise as well as a combined effect of mining-induced seismic events and land subsidence. The medieval Jeroným Mine represents an underground structure loaded with natural and technical seismicity. The paper also includes a short overview of the process of seismic loading evaluation and basic information about historic structures with respect to seismic standards and land surface subsidence caused by underground mining.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of clay minerals (montmorillonite, illite, and kaolinite) on chalcopyrite recovery and flotation kinetic parameters. Classical first-order flotation kinetic model was applied as a function of froth height and amount of clay minerals to fit overall flotation results on chalcopyrite recovery against flotation time. Clay minerals enhanced chalcopyrite recovery by mechanical entrainment and slime coating of valuable chalcopyrite particles. Flotation tests have shown that the deleterious impact of clay minerals on the chalcopyrite flotation is enhanced as follows: montmorillonite&gt;kaolinite&gt;illite. Montmorillonite significantly raised viscosity and also considerably diminished chalcopyrite grade. Recovery and selectivity were lower for montmorillonite than kaolinite and illite. The adjunct of illite was of little effect on chalcopyrite flotation kinetics. The obtained flotation rate constants indicate that clay minerals are carried to the concentrate together with the chalcopyrite. The flotation rate constants increased with increasing the amount of all clay minerals. Slime minerals easily entered to concentrate by mechanical entrainment, and the inhibition effect of clay particles on chalcopyrite became more obvious with increasing flotation time. However, the negative effect of clay minerals is reduced with high froth height.",

For this purpose, in this study, an autoregressive model was used to reduce the uncertainties related to geology and construction time and cost in tunnelling projects. A comparison between the predicted results and the actual values through several statistical indices showed the high-performance prediction of the autoregressive model in the prediction of tunnel resources. Also, three input parameters affecting tunnel construction time and costs, such as RQD, groundwater, and RMR, were considered. The sensitivity analysis of these parameters on the time and cost of tunnelling projects was investigated through mutual information test (MIT). The groundwater was the most effective parameter on the tunnel's time and cost.",

The analysis was based on the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardised Groundwater Index (SGI) in various cumulation periods (1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months) from 1986–2015. Monthly groundwater levels measured in wells and monthly sums of precipitation from meteorological stations in the vicinity of those wells were used to assess the relationships between droughts. During the study period from 1986–2015, three to 43 meteorological droughts and one to five groundwater droughts were identified. Meteorological droughts were most numerous for the shortest cumulation period (1 month), while droughts for the longer accumulation of 24 to 36 months were less numerous. The SPI and SGI indices were most strongly correlated over the annual cycle in the upper part of the catchment (between the Sępólno Wielkie station and well I-33_1). The correlation coefficient r was highest (0.69) between SPI-18 and SGI-1. Correlations were much lower in the middle of the catchment, where the maximum annual r coefficient was 0.39. There was no correlation between droughts in the lower catchment (r=0.14). The correlations presented for the Gwda catchment indicate that the relationship between droughts is not clear.",

    "abstract": "Despite the pro-ecological policy, hard coal still is and for a long time will remain a valuable major source of energy in the world. It is usually found in the form of seams in underground mines. For many years, thin coal seams have been exploited on an increasingly large scale, therefore mines and machine manufacturers are looking for new, effective and safe methods of extraction. One of such methods is the use of a longwall system with a single-head shearer. This solution has been briefly described in the article, with special focus placed on the proprietary dynamic model of a longwall shearer with a chain haulage system. The model concerns a chain-hauled single-head shearer, but can be used to simulate coal ploughs, and to a certain extent, scraper and belt conveyors. There are models in the literature in which the chain is replaced by point masses. In the discussed model, the chain segments have been described as a continuously distributed mass, the value of which changes as the shearer travels along the wall. The shearer has been modelled as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom, placed on elastic skids. The load from cutting, loading and movement resistance has been taken into account in the model. The mathematical model has been saved in the form of scripts in Matlab. The set of scripts allows obtaining information about the behaviour of the shearer and the load on important structural nodes such as skids, chain and loaders fasteners or the driving shaft of the cutting head. The results also enable determining the power demand of the motors as well as calculating the required initial tension of the chain. The fully parametric model makes it possible to analyse the influence of a change in the values of significant parameters of the longwall working, drive units and shearer. This information is crucial at the stage of design construction and verification, which allows avoiding many errors in the prototype.",

This reflects the geology of the City of Belgrade territory, dominated by Neogene and Quaternary sedimentary rocks. The production of crushed rock and sand and gravel on the territory of Belgrade was almost equal, while majority of imported aggregates is sand and gravel due to lower price. Consumption of crushed rocks includes around 90 % of limestone and dolomite, the rest being magmatic rocks. The main issue of using crushed rock on the territory of the City of Belgrade is the long transport routes, which are usually near or more than 100 km, creating more logistic problems and increasing cost of aggregates Therefore it is necessary to establish a good supply system with low socio-environmental impact of aggregate production and transport, and the basis for that is the analysis of actual structure of production and supply of natural aggregates and new potential quarries and/or sand and gravel pits.",

For the first time, data were obtained on the structure of sediments' natural activity and its transformation during the altitude lowering of the riverbed lowering for 400 m. The sediment samples were taken from 12 sampling points and investigated under low-background gamma spectrometry experiments. The content of natural, in particular, daughter isotopes of the U / Th series, 40K, and artificial (137Cs) radionuclides in the sludge was controlled. They can serve as markers of the studied areas' spatial, geochemical, and anthropogenic characteristics. Standards of the content of the radionuclides - marks along the Tisza riverbed and in the vicinity of its tributary rivers have been established. Significant changes in the range of U/Th components under the lowering of the Tisza riverbed are shown, indicating geochemical anomalies in these areas. The cluster and factor analysis methods were used to study the stability of statistical indicators based on the radionuclide content in the highlands of the Tisza River and the nature of latent factors that determine their statistical equivalency and grouping conditions. The radiological research data in the sediments' samples allows for estimating the abundance of chemical elements U, Th, and K as important geochemical and geothermal characteristics of its catchment area. The importance and prospects of radiological monitoring from the origin and in all the Carpathian basins of the Tisza River are discussed, given its importance for the formation of water resources in Eastern Europe.",

    "abstract": "Point clouds are now a standard way of describing objects in many engineering disciplines, whether they are man-made objects such as structures, buildings, or various types of structures. Commonly used methods of acquiring such data include ground, UAV, or even aerial photogrammetry, followed by terrestrial, UAV, and aerial scanning. After measurement (by the scanner) or calculation (from photogrammetry), the point cloud goes through extensive processing that essentially transforms the unordered mass of points into a usable data set. One of the important steps is removing points representing obstructing objects and features, including vegetation in particular. Here, many filtering methods based on different principles are available and suitable for application to different scenes. This paper presents a new method of filtering point clouds based on the visible spectrum color principle using vegetation indexes determined from RGB system colors only. Since each sensor has to some extent, an individual interpretation of the colors, it cannot be assumed to determine specific boundaries of what is and is no longer vegetation. Therefore, it was proposed to use means clustering to simplify the operator's work. The method was also designed in such a way that the entire evaluation could be implemented in the freely available CloudCompare software. The procedure was tested on three different sites with different terrain and vegetation characteristics showing, which demonstrated the applicability of this method to data where the color information (green) uniquely identifies vegetation. The selected vegetation filters ExG, ExR, ExB, and ExGr were tested, where ExG was the best. K-means clustering helps an operator to distinguish more easily between vegetation and the rest of the point cloud without compromising the quality of the result. The method is practically implementable using the freely downloadable and usable CloudCompare software.",

    "abstract": "Air transport plays an important role in multiple aspects of human lives, such as business and leisure. Air transport constitutes an important part of the global economy and, at the same time, has a crucial role in both domestic and international transport. It provides people and goods with connectivity that cannot be challenged by any other means of transport and therefore offers crucial services within the modern economy and society. On the other hand, it is the second biggest polluter among the transport methods. Therefore, there is a need to switch to more sustainable solutions within the aviation sector. To choose the right options, a Life cycle assessment can be a useful tool for evaluating environmental impact. Most of the studies concerned with the environmental impact of aviation focus on the pollutants emitted during the flight, ignoring other direct and indirect effects on the environment. The extraction of raw materials needed for the construction of aviation infrastructure, its manufacturing, operation and maintenance and fuel production is often ignored. In this paper, the first life cycle assessment methodology is explained, along with its benefits and the important role played by the mining industry within LCA. In the next part, we present a possible model for evaluating the overall environmental impact of air transport, divided into four main parts – production, operation, maintenance and liquidation, followed by the analysis of the social aspect of the impact evaluation.",

Because of operational safety issues and to minimize the exposure of local neighbourhoods to the risk of such reservoirs failing, mining operations are limited during the period of waste storage, thereby reducing the impact of exploitation on these objects. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring and analysis of the deformation state of reservoirs and associated facilities are required. Monitoring is most often carried out using geodetic methods, while the deformation analysis is based on determining the displacements of control points and making short- and long-term forecasts of changes in land surface deformation. Presented here is an analysis of changes in the state of displacements and dyke deformations of a currently closed copper flotation tailings reservoir that was used in the 1970s. After the storage of waste was stopped, an intensive two-stage mining operation was carried out under the reservoir. The results obtained from the geodetic monitoring of displacements and deformations of the reservoir dyke are compared with the model values, and the usefulness of the applied theoretical model for describing the vertical and horizontal displacements and horizontal deformations is verified. Based on the comparison results, a hypothesis is presented regarding the causes of the actual condition of the movements of the reservoir dam crest against the background of the expected movements obtained from theoretical modelling. The presented conclusions revise a very rigorous approach to protecting flotation tailings reservoirs against the effects of underground mining.",

The research was carried out among employees in hard coal mines using mainly surveys. The research allowed the authors to examine and analyze the information provided by the miners concerning powered roof support in the era of Industry 4.0 (the Fourth Industrial Revolution). According to the research findings, miners expect improvement in the reliability of the powered roof support, and they want the key operating parameters, especially the required load capacity, to be monitored in real-time so adjustments and improvements can be made. The results of the research point out the needs and expectations of miners. Their opinions should determine the direction and any research gaps into powered roof support.",

    "abstract": "The diversification of import plays a very important role in the current world full of risks and political perturbations. Covid-19 lockdowns and Russian - Ukrainian war cause disruptions in supply chains. Therefore, import diversification is very important for ensuring the country's supply security. There are many measures and tools developed for assessing economic diversification, including import diversification though the majority of studies are addressing export diversification and analyzing the importance of economic diversification for economic growth and macro-economic stability in the primary sector. However, risks of supply disruptions, especially in the current globalized world, can cause many problems for specific industries, regions and countries. There is a literature gap on the analysis of import diversification methods and measures in terms of their suitability for economic analysis and decision-making in all economic sectors, including mining. The paper aims to overcome this gap by analyzing import diversification measures based on a systematic literature review and assessing them according to the main criteria of suitability for economic analysis and decision-making: simplicity, data availability, comparability and transparency. The ranking of import diversification methods and measures was provided based on conducted analysis and assessment.",

    "abstract": "From the perspective of portfolio management, hedging is a proactive risk management measure that aims to protect the portfolio from unwanted drawdown risk and avoid loss on investment by incorporating assets into a portfolio which moves in the opposite direction as the market. However, trying to limit the risk could result in limiting potential profits. Commodities are one of the best hedges against inflation as their price typically accelerates during such times providing benefit to the investor. We use the innovative approach of hedging commodities using a combination of CAPM and RSI Strategy to identify which of 9 observed hard commodities (Aluminium, Zinc, Nickel, Lead, Tin, Copper, Gold, Brent Oil and Natural Gas) should have been incorporated into investment portfolio during the period 2008-2023. The SML strategy is reviewed in the empirical analysis for its suitability as a hedging instrument compared to the RSI, which is regularly used to hedge metals and commodities. Our MS Excel and IBM SPSS software analysis showed that RSI was a better hedging strategy than SML in 21 out of 36 cases but without statistical significance.",

    "abstract": "Making investment decisions in modern conditions is quite complicated. On the example of the construction industry, the article tests the approach based on WACC and WARA analyses. The risk and profitability of the specified markets were analyzed based on the Efficient Frontier method. The Polish market and the group of Euronext markets were selected for comparison. The necessity of calculation of WARA based on only significant assets was determined. The differentiation between WARA and WACC in the Polish construction market can be overcome by maximizing goodwill and intangible assets and minimizing tangible assets. It reveals problems not in the stock market, but in the industry and the economy as a whole, particularly the lack of functioning markets such as the stock market for individual assets. The role of intangibles is different for Euronext markets. On the other hand, the requirement of the international accounting standards to transfer goodwill from assets to \"other income\" in case of a negative value (bad will) makes adequate consideration of goodwill in the WARA model virtually impossible. Another problem is a calculation of relative weights of assets in conditions of occurrence of both positive and negative values, which creates prerequisites for different approaches and interpretations. Building material that is used in the construction industry tries to improve the environment. the source of building materials are natural resources such as sandstone.",

    "abstract": "This research examines the relationship between nuclear energy and environmental quality in Pakistan from 1971-2020 with the help of Fourier ARDL. In 2020, the use of fossil fuels, CO2 emissions, and the population had increased by 203.02%, 211.61%, and 101.18%, respectively, compared to 1990. This rise in contamination has caused a strain on the air quality in the country. To mitigate this, the use of nuclear energy increased from 0.18% in 1990 to 2.34% in 2020. The findings suggest that nuclear energy could be an effective policy for Pakistan if they want to improve its environmental quality. Additionally, it is projected that the detrimental externalities linked to pollution can be minimized in a year. Furthermore, with a 318% rise in energy imports in 2020 compared to 1990, it is vital for Pakistan to responsibly raise its utilization of nuclear energy to lessen its dependence on foreign energy sources and promote environmental quality. The economic repercussions of nuclear energy use in Pakistan are controversial; some studies suggest this increased usage might be impeding economic growth, while other studies suggest the opposite. This analysis seeks to examine the link between nuclear energy production and environmental damage using an appropriate method and scope.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the effect of the quasi-rate of loading in the crushing of tough black sand will be studied experimentally. The Black tuff sand was obtained from the Al-Hala area (Al Tafila) in southern Jordan. Sand chemical composition is composed mainly of SiO2 with a considerable amount of Fe2O3, Al2O3, and CaO oxides. The experimental works will be conducted at different normal stresses (136 kPa, 245 kPa, 463 kPa, and 899 kPa), different relative densities (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%), and different rates of loading (0.50 mm/minute, 1.00 mm/minute and 2.00 mm/minute) using the direct shear tests. All test specimens were prepared with uniformly graded sand, passing United States standard sieve #4, and retained United States standard sieve #8. The results of direct shear tests were analyzed to examine the stress-strain response to different shearing rates and to obtain the shear strength parameters from the Mohr-Coulomb envelope to investigate the factors influencing shear strength parameters, especially the friction angles. After shearing each specimen, sieve analysis was performed to determine the extent of the percentage of particle breakage. Results showed that the rate of loading in direct shear tests plays a significant role in the amount of crushing and in the internal friction angles. The amount of crushing as well as shear strength was increased with the increased rate of loading. Moreover, the microstructural analysis used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the crushing from granular has primarily resulted from disintegration, grinding, and abrasion of particles.",

The raw material intensity decrease is the first strategy. The second strategy is orientated to changes in the production of environmental products. The third strategy is directed at the consumption of products and liquidation after their lifetime. The priority goal of this paper was to demonstrate the development of environmental costs after the implementation of cyclone separators focusing on the expenses in the field of water management. Methods of research were focused on using index analysis and structure analysis. Base index and chain index were used in the analysis of the index. The object of the article was the mining company focused on mining limestone in Slovakia. The priority problem is the dust of the mining process. The research brings new solving a cyclone separator in the mining process for reducing dust. The goal \"Operational Program Environment\" is to invest in the water sector, creating mining companies' problems. Mining companies use water resources for their mining activities. The results of the study show decreasing in environmental costs. Water and sewerage fees eliminate by 11.1 %, air pollution charges by 11.5 %, disposal fees by about 5.2 %, and towing the sump by 1.5 %. The purpose of the mining company is to address environmental costs as a priority issue related to environmental protection. Competitive advantage for the mining industry introduces efficient and acceptable solutions - innovations.",

    "abstract": "The constant growth in resource consumption is putting pressure on the environment. Most resources are non-renewable and, therefore, need to be managed sustainably. For this reason, increased attention is also being paid to their efficient use within the European Union. The European Union is addressing these aspects to maintain long-term competitiveness and ensure sustainable development in line with all the associated environmental impacts. One of the paths currently on offer is a gradual transition from a linear to a circular economy. A CE monitoring system based on a group of indicators has been introduced within the EU. In this paper, we analyse one of the key areas of the circular economy, material recovery of waste, focusing on municipal waste and its position in the EU and Slovak economy. Measure of circular waste reuse, Measure of municipal waste recycling, CW production per inhabitant, Measure of waste landfilling. By analysing the development of the indicators over the last 10 years, we have tried to realistically assess the achievability of the EU recycling and landfilling targets. The situation in Europe in this area is not optimistic since some EU countries will have a problem fulfilling the EU goals in waste management.",

    "abstract": "The article discusses the main features of the organization of telemetry in directional drilling. The constant increase in the complexity of the conditions for the development and operation of fields, oil and gas production, an increase in the intensity of development of already explored fields due to horizontal and cluster drilling required a significant increase in the requirements for the accuracy of diagnostics and active control of the spatial position of the field. In general, the accuracy of measurements and the efficiency of their processing largely determine the cost of well construction. Directional drilling is one of the well construction methods. The most effective directional drilling application is the development of fields located in water areas, in swampy or rugged terrain, where the construction of drilling rigs may violate the requirements for environmental protection and environmental safety. Directional drilling is also widely used in the creation of relief wells for killing blowouts, for forming multilateral wells or deviating the lower part of the well along the productive horizon in order to increase drainage. Well profiles may vary, but the top of the deviated wellbore must be vertical, followed by a deviation of the calculated azimuth. Therefore, the main task of the telemetry system in directional drilling is to constantly monitor the planned trajectory, as well as to maintain the bit trajectory within the corridor that runs inside the open formation.",

The Upper Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary succession is extensively dispersed in Egypt. The present work is devoted to studying the Dakhla shales of (Maastrichtian- Danian), Duwi (Campanian) and Quseir (pre-Campanian) formations. Chemical and mineralogical analyses were conducted by using seven representative surface sections from Dakhla Oasis. Dakhla shales are dominates by Smectite and kaolinite. The average percentages of SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, Na2O and K2O are subordinate values. In contrast, Al2O3 contents of Dakhla shale, TiO2, P2O5 and Fe2O3, contents are relatively higher than common shale composition. The CIA and CIW high values due to clay minerals and the absence of feldspars. This is also confirmed by the smectite domination and subordinate kaolinite in these formations. The ICV values for Dakhla and Duwi shales are 0.59 and 0.74 (ICV &lt; 1). The shale is mature and deposited in a quiescent environment. Whereas the ICV for Quseir shale is 1.24, it can be incidental that it is immature. The shale is wholly detrital and a product of moderate to intensive weathering. The provenance was constituted of granitic and basaltic source rocks, and the parent provenance is basalt. Consequently, the shale is deposited under fluvio-marine environments, and the prevailed condition was of alkaline chemical affinity probably passed through different environments varying from a fluvial, eolian and shallow marine.",

These tasks include the study of the interference of wells, the classification of wells according to their technological and geophysical characteristics, the assessment of the effectiveness of ongoing and planned geological and technical measures, the forecast of oil production for individual wells and the total oil production for a group of wells, the forecast of the base level of oil production, the forecast of reservoir pressures and mapping. For each task, the features of building machine learning models and examples of input data are described. All of the above tasks are related to regression or classification problems. Of particular interest is the issue of well placement optimisation. Such a task cannot be directly solved using a single neural network. It can be attributed to the problems of optimal control theory, which are usually solved using dynamic programming methods. A paper is considered where field management and well placement are based on a reinforcement learning algorithm with Markov chains and Bellman's optimality equation. The disadvantages of the proposed approach are revealed. To eliminate them, a new approach of reinforcement learning based on the Alpha Zero algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is best known in the field of gaming artificial intelligence, beating the world champions in chess and Go. It combines the properties of dynamic and stochastic programming. The article discusses in detail the principle of operation of the algorithm and identifies common features that make it possible to consider this algorithm as a possible promising solution for the problem of optimising the placement of a grid of wells.",

    "abstract": "Extreme hydrological events such as tsunamis, high tides, or storm surges seriously threaten coastal communities. These events result in flooding, property damage, loss of life, and long-term economic and social impacts. Therefore, monitoring and detecting extreme hydrological events significantly affect coastal areas in disaster response efforts. However, the cost of installing and maintaining these stations can be a significant challenge for developing countries. The objective of this study is to use a low-cost GNSS receiver to monitor tides and detect extreme coastal hydrological phenomena by analyzing changes in water level, using analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. Data used in this study were collected from a GNSS station located in the Tam Giang Lagoon area, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam, from September to October 2022. The water level based on GNSS-R is compared with the sensor's measured water level, with the Pearson correlation coefficient reaching 0.96 and RMSE of 0.08m. Continuous Wavelet Transform analysis demonstrated the relationship between water levels and extreme hydrological events. The results show that distinct signatures in the data correspond to the Noru typhoon from September 27-29, 2022, and the inundation from October 14-19, 2022, in Thua Thien Hue. This information is the basis for forecasting and early warning of extreme events and informing disaster response and management efforts.",

This research was aimed at experimental studies of microstructure, phase composition and microhardness distribution in the surface layer of the R6M5 high-speed steel samples after laser cutting, cold treatment and laser tempering. It was demonstrated that after laser cutting in the surface layer of the cut there was the carbide dissolution and enrichment of the metal matrix with carbon and alloying components, resulting in an increase of residual austenite content up to 50...60 %. After the cold treatment in liquid nitrogen the content of residual austenite decreased up to 7...9 %. The laser cut surface microhardness increased up to 1000...1100 MPa. At further laser tempering the dispersion hardening processes took place, as a result the V2C carbides appeared in the steel structure amounting to 4.7 %. The microhardness increased up to 10400...10600 MPa. The study showed the possibility of using the high-speed steel laser cutting not only as a separating operation, but also as a hardening treatment. The findings contribute to the technological support for the development of domestic mining machinery in terms of replacing imported high-speed steels and machine tools.",

    "abstract": "In this study, environmental sustainability is investigated through the ecological footprint variable in India from 1965 to 2018. In this context, the impact of renewable energy use, financial development, urbanization and economic growth on India's ecological footprint is analyzed. Since all variables were stationary at the first difference, the cointegration relationship between variables was tested with Gregory-Hansen and Hatemi-J cointegration tests. Empirical findings have shown that there is a long-term relationship between the variables in the relevant period. FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR estimators were used to determine the direction and magnitude of the effect of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable. The estimation results found that while economic growth increased the ecological footprint the most, financial development decreased the most. In addition, the increase in urbanization increases environmental degradation. However, although the use of green energy is not at the desired level, it increases the environmental quality. On the other hand, the study tests the EKC hypothesis for India. Research results support that there is an inverted-u-shaped relationship between economic growth and ecological footprint. Therefore, for India, whose GDP is integrated with fossil fuels, higher growth at the beginning causes more fossil fuel use and negatively affects environmental quality. On the other hand, increasing urbanization in India, which has an underdeveloped energy infrastructure, increases environmental degradation. However, increasing renewable energy and financial development offer significant opportunities to reduce the ecological footprint.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the evaluation of the structure of selected hazardous wastes from the production of metals, namely waste from the production of aluminium - red mud and waste from the production of nickel - black nickel mud. In environmental applications, red mud and black nickel mud are likely to be used after activation. The samples were activated using hydrochloric acid to study the structure properties before and after the treatment. Both of these wastes have suitable adsorption and catalytic properties that could be positively affected by the activation of their surfaces. The morphology of the samples was documented by scanning electron microscope, phase analysis was performed using diffraction techniques, and the content of elements was determined by EDX analysis. Also, FTIR analysis of the samples was performed. Activation increases the specific surface area of samples, which is beneficial in many environmental applications, such as in the adsorptive removal of pollutants. Treatment of samples changes the surface properties of the adsorbent, such as electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic. The activation creates a new surface structure and thus affects its properties. EDX analysis confirmed the high content of Fe, Al, Si and Ti, which are responsible for good adsorption and catalytic properties. X-ray diffractograms have shown only slight changes in the structure of wastes after activation. The results of SEM confirmed the changes in the surface structure and the creation of new active centres necessary for the successful adsorption process. The FTIR analysis determined the changes in the structure of the samples mainly due to the thermal degradation of C=O and O-Si-O bonds.",

    "abstract": "One of the most common problems mining companies face in developing open-cut deposits in complicated geological and climatic conditions is avalanches during the spring-winter work period. This phenomenon is accompanied by a rapid displacement of snow masses, which can lead to catastrophic consequences. In this regard, the article aims to develop a modernized set of measures for avalanche protection. Prevention of avalanches of catastrophic scale, leading to blockages, road closures, and accidents, and the introduction of measures to reduce accidents and injuries in quarries and dumps, is a time-consuming task that requires serious approaches to its solution. The main research method is analyzing the applied anti-avalanche measures for active impact on snow cover and considering the possibility of using safer methods for active impact on avalanches at a particular mining enterprise. This approach allows for the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the avalanche measures used and for choosing a set of measures to ensure more effective avalanche protection. The authors analyzed the existing shortcomings in the regulatory documents related to the provision of avalanche protection and anti-avalanche measures. It was found that they are not able to effectively ensure the development of internal local documents of enterprises in the field of anti-avalanche measures at the present stage. The resulting study showed that a comprehensive solution to the problem is needed through the introduction of several anti-avalanche devices to reduce the likelihood of avalanches of catastrophic scale. For the first time, the authors attempted to justify the possibility of using a modernized set of measures for the preliminary descent of snow avalanches to solve the problem of avalanche protection in the conditions of a real mountain object. The results obtained can be used to reduce the level of occupational injuries by reducing or eliminating accidents associated with unforeseen avalanches during the operation of an existing quarry.",

Taking MOA of Dianshang under the Taiyuan-Jiaozuo HSR as the engineering background, the model experiments and numerical analysis were employed to reveal the dynamic response of both subgrade and the foundation of the HSR, as well as the attenuation law of the acceleration in the overlying strata of the MOA. Results show that within the full frequency range of the HSR load, the dynamic response of the foundation increases with the increase in load frequency. When the depth exceeds 6 m, the dynamic response of the foundation initially increases and subsequently decreases with the increase in load frequency. Contrasted with single-point loading, the superposition effect and moving effect of the HSR load will form a dynamic response superposition zone within 1-4 m below the subgrade, leading to a significant enhancement of the dynamic response of the foundation. Compared to HSR axle load, the driving speed of HSR has a greater impact on the acceleration of both the subgrade and foundation. The obtained conclusions provide a reference for the safety operation of the HSR crossing the MOA",

    "abstract": "In an era of changing financial landscapes, the position of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as possible national currencies is worth investigating. This study investigates Bitcoin's adherence to currency criteria and its consequences for GDP development in a certain country. The mining industry plays a significant role in the GDP of many countries. The extraction of raw materials such as metals, minerals, and fossil fuels is essential for producing a wide range of goods and services. This generates jobs and tax revenues and supports economic growth. Understanding these processes is critical, given the ongoing debate about Bitcoin's place in modern economies. This research looks into Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency and its possible influence on a certain country's GDP. The results show that Bitcoin fits the requirements for money, acting as a means of exchange and a store of value, with features including mobility, divisibility, commensurability, and fungibility. When examining its influence on GDP, empirical data indicate that, while currency appreciation may provide the illusion of stronger GDP growth when denominated in foreign currency, it damages growth domestically. According to a neural network study, Bitcoin's large impact on GDP renders it unsuitable for use as a national currency in the Czech Republic. Despite matching currency criteria, Bitcoin's adoption confronts problems such as volatility, a lack of central authority, and its worldwide nature, which limit its usefulness in promoting national economic growth. This analysis emphasizes country selection and length restrictions, finding that Bitcoin's existing position as an investment instrument restricts its viability as a national currency.",

The author's team aimed to find the key waste groups according to the classification groups that have a major impact on the volume of waste and the cost of the system, thus facilitating management decision-making. In order to optimise the management of the entire waste management system from the perspective of the statutory municipality, it was first necessary to reduce the original list of 53 waste items to a significantly smaller number. With the help of waste management experts, criteria for reducing the number of waste input items were defined, resulting in a reduced statistical sample of 27 items. Each item is quantified by the amount of waste per year and the cost of the system per year. The mathematical apparatus consisted primarily of calculating average values as well as marginal slopes of waste quantity and cost. The interrelationships between waste groups were graphically recorded in perceptual maps. The individual analyses were carried out primarily for a statutory city, with secondary comparisons of the results with smaller towns and small villages. The analytical procedures verified that the catalogue of basic components of mixed municipal waste can be significantly reduced for decision-making in secondary resource management. The amount of waste selected in each group significantly impacts the cost of the whole waste management system. Of the original 15 waste groups, only three groups appear to be the main ones. The municipal waste group even has a decisive influence on both the quantity of waste and the cost of the whole system. Thanks to these findings, from the point of view of both the manager and the management of the statutory city, it is possible to focus on this core group, which contains the 13 original catalogue items.",

It is also intended for detecting, mitigating and eliminating the consequences of releases of radioactive substances into the environment during the handling of nuclear materials, radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel and during the transport of radioactive materials, and ensuring the collective protection of the population. The evacuation of persons is an issue that has been closely and directly linked to the civil protection of the population and the system of protection against accidents and fires for a long time. In the field of protection against the effects of accidents and fires, the legislative term evacuation of persons is used. In the field of crisis management, legal regulations work with the term evacuation of the population. The population means all persons in places threatened by an emergency, with the exception of persons who will participate in rescue work, manage the evacuation, or perform other activities related to eliminating the consequences of the emergency. In many situations, evacuation of persons is a necessary process that can prevent loss of human life threats to health and the environment. The evacuation process is modified in practical applications into a number of different forms. The standard procedure, which involves quickly leaving the endangered area in the event of an emergency, does not fully express evacuation in its entirety. This mainly concerns evacuation processes associated with the threat of radioactive substances.",

    "abstract": "The article presents the results of comparative numerical tests of typical operating systems of LHD loaders with a proprietary solution based on a patent. LHD loaders belong to the group of basic machines working in various operating systems, including room-and-pillar systems. Due to the thickness of the deposits, mining is frequently carried out in low workings. In the case of typical T-kinematic or Z-kinematic systems, the operation of LHD loaders is more difficult. Due to the low height of the excavation, the excavated material is loaded in several cycles. A smaller machine generates less thrust force, which also negatively affects loading efficiency. Additionally, there are typical operational problems associated with the use of hydraulic actuators, the piston rods of which are exposed to mechanical damage and loss of tightness. In the presented proprietary solution of the working system, the bucket is attached to a telescopic boom system moved by hydraulic rotary actuators (Saga et al., 2019). Moreover, the loader is equipped with spreaders to stabilize the machine. The use of rotary actuators and a lowered pivot point of the bucket, together with a telescopic arm and spreaders, allows the bucket to be loaded in one cycle. In the article, the results of simulation tests of three kinematic systems have been presented. The analysis included, among others, the movement of the bucket, the duration of the cycle, and the related demand for hydraulic oil, as well as the load on the most important structural elements and nodes. The research has shown that the proposed solution can successfully compete with classic systems in terms of load and oil demand while offering an advantage in terms of functionality.",

The analysed belts were of identical strengths, but each with a different carcass structure: without an additional anti-puncture layer (breaker layer), with a single anti-puncture layer made of the same material (polyamide), and with an extra anti-puncture layer made of a special material (aramid). In order to achieve a puncture, threshold values of the impact height and the weight of the impacting material were applied. The output of this paper is the determination of a correlation between the conveyor belt structure and the puncture resistance of the belt. The experimental research indicated that the anti-puncture layer (a breaker) is crucial for the elimination of damage to the belt in the form of a puncture.",

    "abstract": "Landslides significantly threaten infrastructure and human lives, highlighting the need for effective landslide susceptibility mapping. This research focuses on creating a map showing landslide susceptibility along the Swat Motorway using Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) methods. The objective is to assess the spatial distribution of landslide-prone areas along the motorway corridor, aiding in informed decision-making for infrastructure development and risk mitigation measures. The study begins by collecting and analyzing relevant geological, geomorphological, and climatic data to identify factors contributing to landslide occurrences. This includes slope gradient, lithology, land cover, rainfall intensity, and land use patterns. Remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery and digital elevation models, are utilized to extract information on land surface characteristics and terrain attributes. GIS-based techniques are employed to integrate and analyze the collected data, employing various spatial analysis tools and algorithms to locate potential landslide locations. The Weighted Overlay Method is applied to assign weights and combine the different factors, generating a landslide susceptibility index. Based on the landslide susceptibility map, this research aims to identify and discuss the areas along the highway that are extremely vulnerable to landslides. After creating a map of the Swat Motorway's landslide susceptibility, numerous zones that are prone to landslides were found. Two of these zones are particularly prone to landslides. The creation of a susceptibility map of landslides provides valuable information for planning land use, management of infrastructure, and hazard mitigation along the Swat Motorway. It identifies high-risk zones prone to landslides, enabling policymakers and engineers to make informed decisions regarding the construction of new roads, slope stabilization, and implementation of early warning systems. The results of this research add knowledge to the already-existing knowledge on susceptibility mapping of landslides, specifically in the context of the Swat Motorway. By utilizing GIS and RS techniques, the study demonstrates an effective and efficient approach for assessing landslide hazards along transportation corridors.",

    "abstract": "Sufficiently clayey brown soil from the north of Karak /Jordan was stabilized for civil engineering construction. Al-Karak climate is an arid and semi-arid region with long summers and low rainfall, in which the soil is unsaturated. The mineral content of Al-Karak brown soil is predominantly quartz and kaolinite minerals. Incorporating clay, though, keeps the hydraulic conductivity of soil low, increases the swelling and shrinkage potential, and increases the loss of strength due to a reduction in cohesion when the saturation state changes. This work aims to improve the geotechnical properties of Al-Karak brown soil and clay mixture with lime or cement. This research's most important results are enhancing the geotechnical properties of brown soil containing 15 % by weight clay and stabilizing using 1% by weight of lime or cement, particularly after curing for 28 days. The results indicate that the early gain in strength is better with cement, whereas its long-term strength gain is better with lime. Lime is the preferred choice for stabilization because, like cement, it provides chemical stabilization. However, lime offers additional advantages, including greater availability and cost-effectiveness. These benefits make lime particularly suitable for large-scale projects, such as road construction, which require substantial quantities of stabilizing material.",

    "abstract": "The mining industry is one of the priority sources of environmental pollution by potentially toxic metals. The impact on the environment remains significant even after the end of mining activities. Numerous studies report the environmental impact of abandoned mines. Therefore, cleaning of mine territories from the pollution is of priority importance. Phytoremediation and microbial remediation are some of the methods. The study of plants for their possible use in phytoremediation is of great interest. Such works are of great importance in developing modern phytoremediation technologies, as they allow us to find new hyperaccumulators for possible mine reclamation. Microorganisms possessing resistance to heavy metals, such as fungi and bacteria, as well as unicellular algae, may be used to clean up tailings contaminated with potentially toxic metals. The microbiological method of tailings treatment is based on the ability of microorganisms to transform and decompose chemical compounds. Microbial remediation and phytoremediation are attracting more and more attention due to their relatively low cost and environmental friendliness. A large number of studies related to the investigation of mine plants and microorganisms and their utilization for mine cleanup demonstrate the promise of using bioremediation. Further development of bioremediation technologies will be associated with wider implementation of the research findings in practice and the possible use of biotechnology in bioremediation. The successful practical application of mine bioremediation requires a complex interdisciplinary approach associated with biological, ecological, biotechnological, and geographic-geological areas.",

Density mapping, aspect, directional statistical analysis, and swath profiling were applied to identify regional spatial patterns and drainage characteristics. Utilizing historical maps, satellite imagery and a digital elevation model, we digitized and analyzed the abandoned riverbeds to understand the landscape's formation, evolution and current state. The western part of the research area is primarily formed by the Tarna River alluvial fan, which exhibits complex development. The middle section, located between Hanyi-ér and Csincse, comprises coalesced alluvial fans of Bükkalja streams, shaped by the blockage from larger fans on the western and eastern edges. The Sajó-Hernád alluvial fan marks the eastern boundary. The erosion of its ancient western branch reduced the extent of the Bükkalja alluvial fan system. This research highlights the need for more detailed studies, including stratigraphy and seismic profile interpretation, to understand better the tectonic and sedimentary processes that have influenced the region's geomorphological evolution.",

    "abstract": "Initiatives for sustainable destination management have long been a hot topic of the day. The tourism industry is no exception to the setting of strategies and solutions. In terms of ensuring long-term sustainability, many destinations are turning towards setting rules and limits that will be in line with nature conservation. Appropriately applied strategies eliminate the currently widespread phenomenon of over-tourism and, on the other hand, help travellers and local residents get the most out of the destination while minimizing damage to its natural resources. The paper provides a perspective on the implementation of sustainable initiatives in national parks. Using the example of visitors, he analytically evaluates the perception of the approaches to sustainable initiatives for the development of national parks in the tri-bordered area of Slovakia-Poland-Ukraine (Poloniny National Park, Bieszczady National Park, Uzhanskyi National Park) as a potential stimulus for increasing the visitors' rate and the repeated visits of the parks. Using the questionnaire methods survey, it evaluates the attitudes of tourists/visitors in three national parks and compares them with each other in terms of determinable principles and activities that can be implemented in the parks, as well as their motivation to visit again under the conditions of applying sustainability strategies. The results of the research in all three parks point to the fact that these national parks need more significant settings regarding the principles of sustainability, as well as educating the public about their benefits.",

The aim of the paper is to express the risk and impact of flash floods in the Topla River basin (Slovakia) and its sub-basins with regard to the morphometric characteristics of the area. The studied locality, especially the spring of the Topla river, belongs to the area with an existing, potentially significant flood risk threatening not only important localities but also the population. The objective is to support the territories with flood mitigation measures by assessing the basin morphometric factors and classifying such areas into high, medium and low-risk categories of flash floods. The model situation is developed in the ArcGIS program, where the selected important morphological characteristics are assigned to all sub-basins for the Topla river together with its assessment. For each characteristic, the level of risk affecting the flash flood is determined. An important part of this study is developing a river basin susceptibility scale to flood activity in terms of morphometric characteristics obtained from available literature, empirical relationships and human experiences. The result of the sensitivity risk map of the upper part of the Topla river basin is to show where adverse impacts on people and the surrounding environment are expected after flash floods hit (or in the event of hydrological droughts).",

High-quality raw materials and the selection of a qualified supplier are fundamental to increasing innovation in this field. From an occupational safety perspective, the chain quality used in lifting equipment is crucial. A particularly important operating element in hoists and chain pullers is the chain with short links, which largely determines the safety of the crane employees. The article discusses the basic elements affecting the quality and safety of the chain, pointing out that users of these products should be guided primarily by the certificates and approvals provided by the manufacturers and not just by price when choosing a supplier. Investing in the appropriate materials and technology allows for innovations that can significantly increase operational efficiency and ensure a high level of safety. The use of chains that meet stringent quality standards translates not only into a lower risk of failure but also into longer equipment life, resulting in lower operating costs. Changing the approach to selecting suppliers and raw materials can, therefore, be a crucial step in management innovation.",

It explores key contributions from recent literature and case studies, shedding light on the intricate interconnections between subsurface geology and surface features. While remote sensing offers significant benefits, such as higher accuracy and broader coverage compared to traditional methods, it also faces limitations, including resolution constraints, the need for ground-truthing, and poor penetration in vegetated areas, necessitating complementary techniques. Through critical analysis, the article aims to offer valuable insights to researchers, geologists, and industry professionals engaged in mineral exploration and resource management.

The buried depth of the primary ore body exceeds 1000 m, and the occurrence of the primary ore-controlling structure is unknown, highlighting the need for deep exploration. In this study, a wide-field electromagnetic method (WFEM) was applied for deep W–Cu mine detection in the Zhuxi mining area. The relationships among the target body's electrical properties, density, magnetism, and lithology were established using physical property data and a drill-resistivity sounding curve. Combined with known geological data, a two-dimensional geological–geophysical section was drawn, and a three-dimensional geological prospecting model was established based on the inversion of a three-dimensional section slice map of the WFEM. The results show that the WFEM can reveal the distribution pattern of the primary ore-bearing structure and horizon in this area. In addition, hydrothermal alteration activity related to deeply buried rock masses can be obtained, providing a strong basis for the study of metallogenic regularity at a 500–3000 m depth in the Zhuxi mining area and the prognosis for further prospecting.",

    "abstract": "The stability of fractured rock masses and the modeling of underground mining pillars necessitate a comprehensive understanding of behavioral models and mechanical properties. This study employs the Wolfram Mathematica code to investigate mining pillar reliability, specifically focusing on elucidating the influence of scale and shape on pillar strength. Drawing inspiration from methodologies in the existing literature, our approach is based on the Mohr-Coulomb theory and Griffiths's random field of rock strength. This study highlights the significance of shape, where pillar strength exhibits exponential growth with increasing width-to-height ratios. Beyond a critical value, strength surges, especially under elevated confining stress. Additionally, a critical mesh size significantly affects the weakest pillar behavior. Our results confirm the 'size effect,' wherein strength generally decreases with increasing pillar volume. Thus, strength decreases with rising volume until a threshold. Particularly noteworthy is the phenomenon observed in the presence of cracks; initially, an increase in mesh size leads to a decline in strength, corresponding to an increase in the number of cracks. However, this decline stabilizes beyond a critical mesh size, after which strength experiences a resurgence echoing behavior seen in the homogeneous case. In this paper, the reproduction of the scale effect by an algorithm based on the Mathematica code was made to allow a probabilistic study to be carried out because of the random existence of discontinuities in nature – another hand to carry out stochastic modeling of fractures and its influence on the rock mass strength.",

The investigation aims to test different powder flocculants of approximately the same molecular weight and their interaction with waste drilling mud and to identify the flocculant with the best qualities for further use in the industry. The empirical method was applied in the study, during which experiments were carried out on a sample of drilling mud, along with quantitative and statistical analyses. Flocculation was carried out using a Couette cylindrical flocculator. Three flocculants, namely A-150, N-100, N-300, and C-494, from a single manufacturer, Kemira, were also chosen for the study. As a result of the laboratory experiments, it was determined that N-300 was the best flocculant, giving optimum results in the study. It has been found to be capable of separating the drilling mud into water and solids fractions as quickly as possible. In addition, the use of ultra-flocculent treatment to improve the intensity of the sedimentation process of clay suspensions is a prerequisite. Thus, the drilling fluids treated in this way are more environmentally friendly, increase productivity and duration, and reduce production costs. The novelty lies in systematically evaluating various powder flocculants and applying ultraflocculation, a sophisticated hydrodynamic treatment method, to optimize the separation process.",

This area is a component of the dry steppe terrain that makes up a large portion of northern Kazakhstan.

The analysis has identified the most important technologies necessary for successfully searching and providing chromite deposits. Geodetic work is an important part of this process, including triangulation, polygonometry, and levelling techniques. These methods allow for a more accurate determination of the examined area's geometric characteristics, which contributes to a more accurate identification of potential chromite deposits.

The process of separating the regional and residual aeromagnetic data information involved applying the polynomial fitting algorithm prior to filtering. The depth to magnetic sources was estimated using the usual Euler deconvolution approach. The studied area is characterized by fluctuations in aeromagnetic signals, indicating alterations in the magnetic susceptibilities of the underlying sedimentary and basement rocks based on the available information derived from the interpreted data. The filtered aeromagnetic maps may exhibit lineaments that exhibit movement along the NE-SW and NW-SE directions. The depths at which anomalies arise from structural complexities were assessed by Euler configurations within the vertical range of 0 to 2100 meters. The presence of a low sedimentation thickness and a high density of lineaments within the studied area suggests a potential correlation between the identified geological formations and hydrothermal mineralization.",

As a booster of agricultural development, cold-chain logistics holds a pivotal role in promoting agricultural resources exploitation. However, empirical studies focusing on the linkage development of cold-chain logistics and agriculture resources exploitation remain exceptionally sparse. Thus, in this study, a spatial econometric model was proposed to investigate the affect mechanism of cold-chain logistics on agricultural resources exploitation. Statistical and spatial autocorrelation analyses were employed to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the spatial correlation between cold-chain logistics and agriculture in China. In addition, recommendations for the coordinated development of agriculture and logistics were proposed. Results demonstrate that the spatial distribution pattern between agriculture and cold-chain logistics in China is “Henan and Shandong as the center + high in southeast and low in northwest.” and “high in the southeast and low in the northwest.” In addition, cold-chain logistics of the province and adjacent provinces affect agriculture resources exploitation simultaneously, and cold-chain logistics has a positive driving effect on agricultural resources exploitation. However, regional differences exist in the contribution of each element to agricultural resources exploitation. This study provides a reference value for the coordinated development of agriculture and cold-chain logistics.",

    "abstract": "Venture capital (VC) is instrumental in overcoming financial barriers for companies focused on green innovation (GI), enabling them to scale their solutions and strengthen their competitiveness. Despite growing interest in this domain, knowledge remains fragmented. This study employs an integrated methodological approach, combining bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review of Web of Science and Scopus data to identify key trends in GI financing through VC and uncover research gaps for future exploration. Of the 147 identified studies, 49 publications from 2006 to 2025 were included in the final analysis. The findings emphasize the need for further research to reconcile VCs' short-term financial objectives with their investments' long-term environmental impacts. Future studies should also examine the distinct approaches of various VC types—independent venture capital (IVC), corporate venture capital (CVC), and government venture capital (GVC)—toward GI, alongside geographical and cultural factors that influence investment outcomes. Additionally, the cleantech sector and potential synergies between public and private stakeholders warrant greater attention. This study contributes to the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV) theories by demonstrating how VC financing is a strategic tool for enhancing firms' competitive advantage and environmental sustainability. It offers valuable theoretical and practical insights for firms, investors, and policymakers. However, potential limitations include reliance on Web of Science and Scopus databases and a focus on English-language publications, which may have excluded relevant studies.",

    "abstract": "Mining vehicles expose drivers to a significant level of vibration. If these vibrations exceed the standard levels, they can have an adverse musculoskeletal effect on the driver's health and safety. Among all mining vehicles, haul trucks transfer a significant amount of vibration to operators. This paper aims to assess the health risks caused by whole-body vibrations to the drivers of loading and hauling vehicles at the ShahVali Marlstone mine in Birjand, Iran. To achieve this, 13 dump trucks with capacities ranging from 20 to 35 tons were selected for data collection under normal operating conditions. Then, the whole-body vibration of the drivers was measured and analyzed according to the 2631-1 and -5 ISO. Regarding the results of this study, all vehicles have medium to high levels of vibrational health risk. The rigid truck had the highest level of harmful vibrations compared to articulated ones. According to ISO 2631-1, the average vibration magnitude for rigid truck drivers was 1.5 times greater than that of articulated truck drivers, while the vibrational health risk assessed by ISO 2631-5 was at higher levels. The mean seat isolation efficiency for rigid and articulated trucks was 84% and 72%, respectively. This indicated that seats with mechanical suspension systems transferred a higher level of harmful vibrations to the drivers compared to seats equipped with an air suspension system. Moreover, the mean acceptable truck operation time limit for articulated trucks is approximately 2.5 times shorter than that of rigid trucks.",

    "abstract": "The article investigates the performance of gold as an asset class compared to major financial indices such as the S&amp;P 500 and DAX since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. The study aims to evaluate gold's role as a hedge against inflation and market volatility, assessing its effectiveness as a stable investment during periods of economic uncertainty. The research uses historical data to examine annual and tax-adjusted returns and cumulative abnormal returns to provide a comprehensive analysis of gold's performance relative to these indices. The findings indicate that gold has generally outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and DAX, particularly in times of financial crises such as the 2008 financial meltdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. The tax-adjusted performance further underscores gold's advantages for long-term investors, highlighting its non-inflationary nature and limited availability. While the statistical significance of gold's abnormal returns varies, its positive cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) emphasize its robustness as an investment. The research involves a two-sample t-test to compare the returns of gold with those of the S&amp;P 500 and DAX. The results reveal that gold offers a significant positive return difference compared to the tax-adjusted index returns of these indices, reinforcing its value for portfolio diversification and performance enhancement",

In addition, it is important to include the environmental aspect so that the customer is satisfied with the landscape of the product. Therefore, the purpose was to develop a concept for product quality assessment that considers criteria relations. This concept will be created based on qualitative-ecological interactions and will also include the weights of product criteria. The proposed conception relies on combined instruments, for instance, the SMART(-ER) method, a questionnaire with comparison in pair method, AHP method, DAMATEL method, Likert scale, WPM method, and relative state scale. The idea is to support an expert in assessing any product that will be selected by an individual customer.

Although the coal mining sub-sector accounts for 25% of the number of employees in the mining sector, one in every two occupational accidents occurs in this sector. In this respect, this study aims to determine the perspectives of employees in underground units regarding the process of preventing occupational accidents in the coal mining sub-sector. For this purpose, the study used the grounded theory design of qualitative research designs. This study was conducted on a study group consisting of 20 underground unit employees selected according to the purposeful and theoretical sampling strategy in a coal enterprise with the lowest accident rate in Turkey. Qualitative data in the study were collected through semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique in the MAXQDA 2024 program. The research findings show that the prominent factors in preventing occupational accidents in coal mines are the management's commitment to safety, rules, risk awareness and safety focus, inspection, and incentive practices. Among these factors, it is seen that the management's commitment to safety stands out. Prioritizing safety and risk awareness and maintaining this commitment with rules, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms are essential in reducing work accidents.",

    "abstract": "Early identification of imminent bankruptcy is crucial for saving a company. It allows for timely implementation of essential measures through preventive restructuring. This paper addresses the current issue of identifying impending bankruptcy in non-financial companies. Existing predictive models can be used to detect imminent bankruptcy, but most of them fail to identify it in time. In this paper, we apply our own predictive model, HGN. Previous research has confirmed its usefulness in performance evaluation, as well as its predictive capability. The model takes into account significant factors that influence the unfavourable financial situation of a company. Detecting the imminent bankruptcy of a company in a timely manner requires an exact approach to modifying the model. The modified version of the model places a strong emphasis on the company's debt situation, regardless of the time horizon of the debt. For the purposes of early identification of impending bankruptcy, the model is tested based on real data from a company in the Mining of chemical and fertiliser minerals sector (SK NACE 08.91.0). The company underwent restructuring and eventually went bankrupt, meeting the criteria for testing the identification of imminent bankruptcy. By substituting certain financial indicators contained in the basic version of the HGN model, we modify its calculation to provide a more objective forecast of undesirable development. The modification emphasises the financial situation and the factors that significantly influence future trends. Based on the comparative analysis and quantified results, we recommend the preference of the HGN model for the early warning system.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between inflation and gold prices, with a focus on temporal dynamics and regional differences in Europe and the United States. Using monthly data and examining lagged effects of up to 4 months, it provides a thorough analysis of how inflation, measured through the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), influences gold prices across various price levels. The results confirm that gold acts as a reliable short-term hedge against inflation, especially for higher price levels, with the strongest effects occurring at lag periods of 1.5 to 2 months. However, over longer lag periods, the relationship weakens significantly, with cumulative impacts turning negative, particularly for lower price ranges These findings underscore the temporal complexity of gold’s effectiveness as an inflation hedge and its susceptibility to broader macroeconomic influences. A distinguishing feature of this study is its combination of temporal analysis with a comparative regional framework, which uncovers meaningful differences between Europe and the U.S. While both regions show strong short-term positive correlations between inflation and gold prices, the U.S. exhibits a sharper decline in cumulative effects over longer lag periods, likely due to greater sensitivity to external factors such as monetary policies and currency fluctuations. The findings are particularly relevant for policymakers and investors, highlighting the need for strategies that consider the timing and regional context when using gold as a tool to counter inflation.",

Without the government's intervention, there is no market consensus between companies and households to take into account interests other than their own. Therefore, the state should act as a regulator in relation to the environment in the economic market. The aim of the paper is to analyse environmental taxes in selected EU countries. In the contribution, we will focus on a detailed analysis of selected environmental taxes in selected EU countries and the definition of the main differences between the established environmental taxes. The result of the issue is a proposal for environmental taxes at the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. We focused on two EU member countries (Slovakia and Hungary) for comparing the shares of environmental taxes on GDP. Indicators such as geographical location, history and the state of the economy played a role in this selection. In accordance with the environmental policy of the European Union, the basic principles are considered non-binding rules on which decisions and programs are based. In the Treaty of the European Community, these principles are established in Article 174 par. 2. It is necessary to have an overview of all principles to reveal the functionality of environmental policy in the EU correctly.

However, investigating the feasibility of yield estimation using a single-dated satellite image still needs to be solved today. The benefits of using a single-dated satellite image in yield estimation and optimum timing are among the issues to be considered in future studies. This study developed a parcel-based yield model using a single satellite image for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 years and meteorological data in Kadirli-Osmaniye, Türkiye. The SPOT 6&amp;7 satellite images were acquired at an appropriate time of the plant cover (the greenest period of the plant). For four months, photographs and values of plant height are provided weekly from fieldwork to determine crop cover fraction and monitor vegetation development. Regression analysis was performed with 12 vegetation indexes obtained from satellite images and crop cover fractions. In all calculated yield models, the relationship between I.-II.-III. soil classes selected, considering soil maps and yield, are compared. The relative errors of the low-yield fields were calculated between 10% and 35% (according to the yields obtained at harvest time). As a result, it was determined that a single satellite image could model yield estimation of corn and sunflower for each year on fields with an average of 0.10 relative errors.",

LSPMM are well recognized and used, also in the heavy industry in the drives which do not need a change of the rotation speed, but they can not drive the machines requiring high starting torque or machines with big inertia torque (for example, mills or belt conveyors while fully loaded during start-up). The novel design of LSPMM with winding in the rotor was developed, described, manufactured and tested. LSPMM with winding in the rotor (LSPMMwWR) do not need frequency inverters for start-up and operation, and that kind of motor can be used for driving machines with big inertia torque or machines requiring high and long-lasting starting torque. The advantage of LSPMMwWR over LSPMM is characterized mainly by minimizing thermal losses in the rotor, which do not cause thermal overheating of permanent magnets, and also by higher starting torque. The experimental model of the LSPMMwWR was manufactured and tested, and the results are presented in the paper. Additionally, the paper shows an example of the use of PMSM in suspended trains for underground applications in coal mines. The train and the motors are supplied from lithium-ion batteries designed and tested for the explosion-risk areas.",

The solution is to minimize dangerous vibrations occurring in the belt conveyor drive by predicting their occurrence using dynamic models. The article presents a complete dynamic model that describes the real mechanical system and its verification by the method of reducing the number of degrees of freedom of replacement dynamic torsion systems. When creating models, the method of partial frequencies is applied to a six-mass mechanical system. Subsequently, the calculation of the reduced new system is compared with the calculation of the original system. At the same time, a simulation calculation approach in the MATLAB program is also applied. The calculations aim to determine the specific angular frequencies and mode shapes for each degree of reduction and system type. The calculation model using the Holzer tabular method is verified by calculation in the MATLAB simulation program. Both approaches provide good technical accuracy with a tolerance of up to 5 %.",

Metal commodities are irreplaceable for the sector of developed countries, and their scarcity during the COVID-19 period increases both their price and, subsequently, the price of products made of these metals. The paper deals with the trend of selected metal commodity prices on the global market in the context of the macroeconomic indicator trend of Poland's inflation rate. The paper aims to predict the inflation rate trend in Poland and determine which of the selected metal commodities is most closely linked to the economy. The research data were obtained from Investing.com (2024) and Eurostat (2024) and converted to time series. The price of metal commodities is given in US dollars per tonne, while the inflation rate is expressed as a percentage. The data on the development were processed using artificial intelligence and recurrent neural networks, including the Long Short Term Memory layer. In general, neural networks have great potential to predict this type of time series. The experiment involved prediction models built on artificial neural networks (NN) with the LSTM layer and 19-day lag. The research confirmed that the development of copper, zinc, and aluminum prices is closely interlinked with the Polish economy. Therefore, the inflation rate in Poland can be predicted with a high probability based on the development of the examined metal commodities prices.",

The research targets a diverse range of industries, with a significant representation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The findings reveal that most firms exhibit a moderate understanding of climate change risks, with larger firms being more proactive in conducting formal assessments and integrating these risks into their strategic planning. Key risks identified include extreme weather conditions, increased energy costs, and regulatory changes. The financial impact of climate change varies significantly across industries and firm sizes. Larger firms, such as those in manufacturing and retail, manage to stabilize profitability through technological upgrades and efficiency improvements. In contrast, financial services firms face substantial challenges due to increased insurance claims and regulatory costs. Smaller firms report adverse effects on profitability due to rising material costs, though investments in renewable energy provide some mitigation. The ability to adapt to regulatory changes and market demands also plays a critical role in sustaining profitability in the face of climate change. This study underscores the critical need for enhanced climate change risk awareness, strategic integration, and supportive measures to bolster resilience and profitability across all sectors in Cyprus, emphasizing the importance of proactive climate risk management as a cornerstone of sustainable business practices.",

    "abstract": "The names of objects and places (toponyms) are frequently assigned based on various distinctive elements, including the features of the geographical environment. Since these features also aid in the identification of the types of landscapes, toponyms are widely used in analyses aimed at finding relationships between their spatial distribution and the elements shaping the space. Researchers have particularly favoured analyses concerning mountain landscapes. However, a detailed review of the literature on this subject indicates that such studies rarely extend beyond the boundaries of these regions. For this reason, it was decided to inspect whether there are more localities and physiographic features with mountains in their names in the mountain landscapes compared to other types of landscapes. A quantitative and spatial analysis of the distribution of toponyms with mountains in their names was conducted as part of the research. The following measures were determined: (i) an index calculated as the product of the number of localities (physiographic objects) with mountain-related names located in a landscape zone divided by the area of that zone; (ii) the percentage share of the number of localities (physiographic objects) with mountain-related names located in a landscape zone compared to all localities within that area. Additionally, the types of objects assigned to the points representing localities with these mountain-related names were examined. Data were sourced from the State Register of Geographic Names. The research was conducted over the entire area of Poland. In the case of locality names, both their number and density increase with the average elevation of the terrain. However, the analysis of physiographic object names did not reveal such clear correlations. Nevertheless, in both cases, the highest coefficients were observed for mountain landscapes. Additionally, it was noted that in other areas, names related to mountains were given to objects that in some way stood out from their surroundings and not necessarily be actual mountains.",

Among the most serious negative impacts of mining activities on the environment is the disturbance of surface stability caused by the presence of open mined out areas underground, which can cause damage to construction objects, linear structures, risk of accidents and danger to life during the movement of people. The paper analyses the environmental impacts of gypsum mining and the establishment of the excavated area during mining activities. Attention was paid to a mining company that operates an anhydrite and gypsum mine, which is the second largest mine in Europe. The current methods of mining and proposals for new methods of foundation were presented. We have analysed the process of founding excavated spaces when mining is increased, with the financial impact and determination of the additional costs of founding the excavated space. We proposed the provision of a foundation with a financial assessment of the costliness of the process. The paper concludes with options for effectively eliminating negative impacts in mining operations.",

    "abstract": "The Open-pit mining operations and techniques can cause substantial modifications to the rock mass structure, which could result in the incidence of landslides in the slope regions of active mining operations. Advances in the mining field have generated many stability analysis methodologies to address this issue. This study aims to assess the stability of the edges of the Kef Essnoun Phosphate Mine (Algeria) located in the northwest, where the current mining activities are taking place. The numerical modeling of the rock mass, based on extensive field and laboratory testing for mass characterization, played a crucial role in determining the potential for danger along the slopes and steps of the mine. Calculations of safety factors indicated that the rock mass, with its complex geological conditions characterized by heterogeneity and weathering, was vulnerable and unstable on the northern edge, compared with the southern edge, which proved stable with a safety factor exceeding the required safety margin. In order to minimize the risk of landslides, we chose a reinforcement method adapted to our case study.",

    "abstract": "The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has spurred a massive construction drive in Pakistan, necessitating the exploration of diverse natural aggregate sources to sustain this development. Therefore, this study delves into the petrographic characteristics and mechanical properties of carbonate rocks from the Chichali Gorge (Lockhart and Nammal Formations) and Zaluch Gorge (Amb Formation) in the Western Salt Range, Pakistan. Employing geotechnical analyses adhering to British Standards (BS) and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, various laboratory analyses were conducted. Simple regression analysis unveiled interrelationships among physical parameters. Petrographic scrutiny categorized Lockhart (LFPal) and Nammal (NFEo) Formations as wackestone and Amb Formation (AFPm) as mudstones. Calcite and bioclasts emerged as primary components, shaping the limestones. Petrographic insights elucidated the rocks' engineering traits, establishing correlations between petrography and diverse physical and mechanical properties. Notably, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Unconfined Tensile Strength (UTS) exhibited direct associations with calcite content but inverse correlations with porosity and bioclasts. Rocks with higher porosity and water absorption displayed diminished strength, while those with lower porosity exhibited robust strength metrics. Based on these analyses, LFPal and NFEo emerged as pivotal sources for small- and large-scale projects, including CPEC. However, due to their elevated silica content, caution is advised concerning AFPm aggregates. This study provides valuable insights for construction endeavors, ensuring informed material selection for optimal project outcomes in the CPEC framework.",

    "abstract": "Environmentalne riziko pri ukladani kvapalných odpadov do horninotvorneho masivu Although the liquid waste storage is environmentally safe, the injection process can be potentially accompanied by failures, resulting in some negative environmental impacts. This paper discusses the problem of environmental hazards related with failures of the injection installment on the surface and underground. The surface failures are most frequently related with sewage and waste pits, injection pumps, systems for physical and chemical processing of waste before injection, pumping pipelines, and wellhead in the injection well. The most common failures of the underground parts are: failures of pumping columns, sealing packer, casing and the cement layer in the angular space. Injection of sewage and liquid waste, produced during the completion and exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits, into depleted oil and natural gas strata and hydrogeological structures is the most efficient ways of their utilization. Although this method is considered to be environmentally safe, failure may occur during injection. This may have a negative impact on some elements of the environment (6). Complications and failures may occur both at the surface and in the underground part of the injection installment. The surface breakdowns are most frequently related with the failure of liquid waste pits, pumps, systems for physical and chemical treatment of liquid waste, pumping pipelines and wellhead in the injection well. Underground breakdowns are most frequently related with the failure of pumping columns, sealing packer, casing and cement layer in the annular space. The deposition of waste in the rock mass may also result in the contamination of the water and ground environment, being a consequence of migration of the injected waste beyond the storage structure. The migration of waste may take place through fractures and discontinuities in the form of, e.g. faults, tectonic windows in the onlying strata, etc. The intensity of flow of waste beyond the structure may be assessed on the basis of manifestations observed in observation wells as well as with the use of simulators of the contamination migration. A quick advancement of science and technology enables to limit the risk of occurrence of these failures and their consequences. However, the applied technical and technological solutions are not fully reliable and cannot guarantee that no such event takes place at all. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the environment in the direct vicinity of the place where liquid waste is injected to the rock mass.",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of the main structural elements of rock liningsto external short-term and long-term loads is an important problem in the mining industry. The existing schemes are not designed for the simultaneous perception of compressive, shock and vibration influences. A way to solve this problem is to develop a new structural scheme of the racks, which are the linings' main bearing element. In the article, it is proposed to use multi-layer racks made as a rod covered with layers of plates.This will make it possible to use for damping external loads not only the pliability of the rack as a whole but also the frictional forces between its layers.The acting impact force will be decomposed into compressive and pressing forces. Due to the fact that the action of the external shock load is spent on moving and pressing the layers, its deformations are minimized compared to single-layer monolithic structures.For calculating the arising stresses, it is assumed that the rack plates are hinged at the edges, free along the length of the rack, and are under the joint action of compressive (stretching) forces and tangential forces evenly distributed on all sides of the plate.The article provides a rationale for the prospect of using such multi-layer racks and proposes an algorithm for calculating critical loads and stresses with the derivation of the damping coefficient. This coefficient is determined by the difference between the force of the shock wave and the critical load. The critical force, in turn, is calculated as the difference between the compressive force and the friction force between the layers, corrected for the part of the impact force, which causes stress close to critical in the dangerous middle section of the plate. By the value of the coefficient, it can be judged the effectiveness of the selected structural scheme of the rack.",

    "abstract": "Release valves are commonly used to protect hydraulic legs against overload caused by rock bursts or bumps. Due to an essential role in ensuring safety in the working, an application of a release valve is conditioned by a positive yield test results of a leg equipped with such a valve. A method of leg yield testing, used in Poland, enables a complex determination of an impact of not only a release valve but also of the parameters of the hydraulic leg, determining its stiffness such as for example a volume of the under-the-piston space, which has an impact on an observed pressure increase. The subject of this publication covers cognitive tests oriented onto a determination of an impact of a release valve exclusively on the pressure changes observed in the leg. The results of the efficiency tests of spring valves (Stoiński, 2018) on a rammer are discussed. The difference between the maximum pressure in the under-piston area of the leg with the release valve and the maximum pressure generated by the same dynamic load in the leg without this valve was the measure of the valve operation's effectiveness. Dynamic load, realized on a rammer, is characterized by a longer increase time than in the case of dynamic load acting on a powered roof support unit from the floor. The time process of the force in the leg is then characterized by a short load rising time – tn, large load increment factor – Kd and the average load growth rate –wp,n. Referring to that aspect, the features of a release valve were analyzed in relation to the parameters characterizing dynamic load acting on a powered roof support unit from the floor. Parameters characterizing the effectiveness of the release valve, i.e. change in the leg load increment index –Kd and change in the rate of load increase –wpn were defined. The test stand for generating the load of such parameters using the explosive method is described. Comparison of effects of the dynamic load generated by firing the same mass and the same type of explosive on a hydraulic leg with a release valve and the leg without this valve was the test objective. The effectiveness of the spring valve and two gas valves are analyzed. It was found that despite a very short load rising time, the release valve reduces the load acting on the leg. The positive values of the Kd and wp,n indices are the evidence.",

    "abstract": "A tunnel boring machine (TBM) is a machine that is used to excavate tunnels with a circular cross-section. TBMs can bore through a variety of ground conditions. Tunnel boring machines are used as an alternative to drilling methods. TBMs have the advantages of limiting the disturbance to the surrounding ground. Predicting the load on cutting tools in tunnel boring machines is important for the mining process. The article presents a proposal for a method of forecasting the load on mining machinery tools. This paper presents current trends in hard rock tunnelling, including the directions of research on automated excavation processes. Particular emphasis is put on the aspects of predicting load variations in the cutterhead tools, which is of vital importance for machine power selection and mining process control, among others. The problem of predicting the load and wear of excavation tools plays an important role in designing and maintaining cutterheads. The effective monitoring of the operation of multi-tool cutterhead knives and their replacement time depend on correct identification of the type and condition of the excavating tool cutting insert. A neural network with a multilayer perceptron structure was used as a prediction tool. The concept of this network type is based on the arrangement of neurons in successive layers. This neural network type is treated as an input-output model. Its parameters include weights and threshold values.",

    "abstract": "Morphometric analysis is frequently used for the assessment of neotectonic/young tectonic movements. The analysis consists of several methods that, in some cases, may yield different results. We used six morphometric methods to evaluate 42 river/creek catchment areas comprising the Spišská Magura region and adjacent parts of the Belianske Tatry Mts. Each method evaluated the possible influence of tectonics on topography numerically (by parameters). The integration of the mean parameter values was used to obtain the relative tectonic activity index (Iat), based on which we determined the role of the tectonic activity in the evolution of each analyzed catchment area. A comparison of the integrated map of relative tectonic activity with the known tectonic lines shows the little match in the Spišská Magura region. This is especially valid for the areas along with a striking Subtatric-Ružbachy fault system (SRFS) that is assumed to be active in the late Pleistocene and where morphometric criteria only show little tectonic activity. In contrast, the parameters provided by some individual methods used for the integrated map of the relative tectonic activity indicate a good match with known tectonic lines. For example, the basin shape ratio and mountain front sinuosity suggest high tectonic activity along the border of the Spišská Magura region and the Pieniny Klippen Belt, which is also indicated in geological maps. The evaluation of U- versus V-shaped valleys (Vf index) shows more intensive uplift of the areas of the Belianske Tatry Mts. compared to the areas within the Spišská Magura region, which is also expected from the geological maps and other studies. The evaluation of individual morphometric parameters and the parameter obtained by their integration implies the necessity to use several morphometric methods for a more reliable assessment of the role of tectonics in the evolution of studied areas.",

    "abstract": "The study's research question in the broader context of the fight against the pandemic is the impact of disinfectants on selected surfaces of materials used in air transport. The main scientific goal of this work was to verify the assumption that disinfectant solutions cause degradation of mechanical and physical properties, i.e., chemical aging, in samples from airport conveyors, and to determine the degree of change in the properties of the samples depending on the time spent in solution and on aging. The research methodology was developed based on the ISO 1817: 2011 standard, STN EN ISO 868, and the ISO 283 standard, and applied infrared spectroscopy, specifically the Attenuated Total Reflectance method. Research suggests that constant disinfection of baggage handling systems will require the replacement of carrying parts. Otherwise, there will be significant costly breakdowns (damage to luggage, interruption of its flow, delays/inability to check in the aircraft, and the resulting legal consequences). The longer the samples were left in the disinfectant solution, the higher and more uneven the degradation. The hardness of the samples changed after immersion but was not directly proportional to the change in tensile properties. During disinfection, chemical changes occurred, which varied in length and effect depending on the disinfection used.",

    "abstract": "Easily available sources of iron ore, the abundance of hydropower, and wood for charcoal were the prerequisites for the development of iron metallurgy in Slovakia. Since the 16th century, the bloomery process used in iron metallurgy has been gradually replaced by the blast furnace process. This new process was more economical, but it required extremely high investments. The steam engine replaced the unreliable water power in the blowing process, and coke replaced charcoal. Especially due to economic problems, the first blast furnaces in Slovakia started to be built about two hundred years later than in Western Europe. Despite the promising start, the installation of steam engines was lagging. A major drawback was the lack of road and rail networks combined with the absence of local coking coal. The introductory part of the paper compares chronologically the individual stages of the development of blast furnace production in Slovakia and abroad. Next, the paper presents comprehensive results of the analysis of samples of the slag found at 59 sites of extinct ironworks with a blast furnace, localised until now. The samples were analysed by metallographic, chemical, spectral (secondary and trace elements), and X-ray methods. In the past, these data were published with territorial restrictions and mostly in a language other than Slovak. The contents of secondary and trace elements in slag from individual sites using cluster analysis and also metallic iron content in slags categorised according to owners of the blast furnaces and the slag basicity are compared.",

All this results in the formation of asphaltene-resin-paraffin deposits (ARPD) and stable oil-water emulsions, which in turn leads to premature failure of downhole pumping equipment. In this work, the scope of measures to prevent malfunctions of pumping units is considered. The use of the SONKOR-9701 inhibitor through a special design of the ESP power cable with a capillary conveying line for supplying the chemical reagent to the reception delivers the chemical reagent directly to the required entry point with the most effective dosage and ensures a prompt change of the dosage and type of the reagent. With this technology, the reagent is not consumed for the repletion of the oil column in the annular space; its adsorption is on the surface of the casing and tubing. Thus, the reagent targeted with just specific technological causes and the greatest effect is ensured. Due to the introduction of a special cable with a capillary conveying line, it is planned to increase the average operating time for failure and, consequently, reduce the maintenance job at the Gremikhinsky oil field. It is also predicted the additional volume of extraction because of a special submersible cable device (SSCD), as well as by increasing the delivery (capacity) rate of the pump.",

Since mining companies are important for the industry, it is necessary to predict their economic development. Moreover, forecasting the economic development of an enterprise in terms of the risk of bankruptcy is an important activity for the financial management of any enterprise. One of the ways to predict economic development and assess the risk of possible bankruptcy is to use bankruptcy models. The aim of this paper is to determine the most appropriate model for predicting the bankruptcy risk of a mining company. The subject of the article is to identify the most suitable bankruptcy models applicable for bankruptcy risk prediction in Czech conditions of mining enterprises and to verify their functionality on real data of mining enterprises. On the basis of a search of expert sources and comparative analysis, it was found that the most suitable models for predicting the development of the enterprise in terms of bankruptcy risk are modified versions of traditional bankruptcy models. The analysis showed that the bankruptcy models are the IN05 Index, Altman's analysis for Czech companies and the modified Taffler's index. The authors' team conducted a thorough analysis during which they verified the functionality of the selected bankruptcy models on real data of mining companies. After a thorough analysis to test the functionality of bankruptcy models on real data from mining companies, the most appropriate model for estimating the evolution of bankruptcy probability risk was identified.",

The Ermenek coal basin is located in the Western Taurus Mountains in the southern part of Turkey, which covers an area of approximately 620 km2 and is a Neogene coal basin. This paper generates spatial modeling of Pamuklu-Tepebaşı coal seams in the Ermenek Basin and the prediction of coal reserve by using geostatistical methods with Ordinary Kriging (OK) based on the GIS technique. The data used in the study were obtained from 82 boreholes belonging to a private company that has actively produced coal in the Pamuklu-Tepebaşı coalfield. In this study, the OK method was applied to spatial coal seam modeling for comparison of the performance of 11 distinct models. Using the rational quadratic models better explained the spatial structure of the coal seam depth data. The nugget-sill ratio indicated high spatial dependency with 0.01 and 0.02 for coal seam upper-lower surfaces, respectively. The kriged coal depth maps for upper and lower coal seam surfaces have been created using ArcGIS 10.2 software. As a result of these analyses, it was calculated that there is a coal reserve of 3.734.017 m3 using the determined surfaces with OK in the study area. Furthermore, developed spatial distribution maps in the study area could be helpful to plan further exploration activities.",

    "abstract": "The use of renewable energy sources to supply power to energy-isolated areas is an urgent topic. The simplicity of the design and high reliability of inductor generators create good prospects for their use in wind power plants as an alternative to synchronous and asynchronous electric machines that are currently in use. An obstacle to such an application is the specifics of the design, construction, and execution of modular machines with magnetic switching, concentrated windings, and a distributed magnetic system integrated into the wind turbine design. The purpose of the study is to consider cause-effect relationships and establish relationships between magnetic flux, EMF, the geometry of electric and magnetic circuits, the structural arrangement of electric windings, and circuit solutions of an automatic electromagnetic excitation system for the design of a new type of generators. The current issues of the effective use of an exciting magnetic flux for voltage regulation in power supply systems powered by power plants, the main generators of which contain a distributed magnetic system with concentrated electric windings, are considered. The optimal structural compositions and geometry of the ratios of electric and magnetic circuits are determined from the machine's basic calculation equation, which is obtained under the condition of maximum magnetic flux. The reasons for the induction of variable EMF in the DC excitation windings, which prevent the effective magnetization of the machine, have been established. The location of the electric windings is proposed, which makes it possible to weaken or completely compensate for the pulsations of the magnetic flux coupled with the exciting circuits. It is established that in order to eliminate parasitic EMF in the exciting windings, it is necessary to use two-circuit circuits for alternating switching of the magnetic flux in the circuits, with sequential activation of the sections of the windings of the exciting circuits. To completely eliminate these EMFs, performing two-circuit magnetic flux switching circuits with a common exciting winding is advisable. The methods and features of the circuit implementation of the conditions of electromagnetic excitation and maintenance of voltage constancy at the output of generators of a new type are considered.",

    "abstract": "The paper reflects the results of the ongoing discussion about sustainable development in Slovakia as an increasingly urgent topic resonating across scientific disciplines. Specifically, it deals with the participation processes, which were realized in 2022-2023 under the auspices of the Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatization of the Slovak Republic (MIRRI), and the second part of which was implemented at the Institute of Management of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava using its expert and organizational capacities. The mentioned activities follow the strategic document entitled Vision and Development Strategy of Slovakia 2030 and are related to the preparation of the document Vision and Development Strategy of the Slovak Republic until 2050 – Slovakia 2050. In the light of the outputs from the participation processes, the paper deals, among other things, with the necessity of accelerating the transformation of regional economies from the industrial towards the post-industrial society, including sustainable innovation-oriented circular economy less dependent on raw materials and energy, with the simultaneous optimization of the system of decision-making and effective management, based on partnership and division of responsibilities between different levels and various actors of sustainable development. It also points out that discussions about this vision have the potential to significantly frame the creation of concepts of integrated territorial innovation-oriented clusters, the urgency of which - in parallel with the frustration of the ineffectiveness of fragmented development processes and activities - is felt at different levels by practically all participating subjects of the professional discourse analyzed in this paper. The results of the participation process fully confirm that Slovakia is not adequately prepared to respond to the challenges associated with all the necessary transformation processes.",

At the moment, the actual oil recovery factor often deviates from the design values, which leads to inefficient production and loss of resources. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop a meth-odology for optimizing the process of monitoring and regulating an oil field development facility using block factor analysis and de-signing hydraulic fracturing cracks. The work uses methods such as block factor analysis, 3D modeling, hydrodynamic modeling, and mathematical modeling. The result of the study is a developed methodology for optimizing the process of monitoring and regulat-ing an oil field development facility. The article also discusses the main reasons for the deviation of actual oil production from calcu-lated values, including hydraulic fracturing technology. Unsuccess-ful cases of this procedure and their causes were identified. The features of the block factor analysis tool and the proactive analysis method are described, as well as how to use it at the design and modeling stage of hydraulic fracturing to improve the efficiency of the well-stimulation operation. Successful implementation of hy-draulic fracturing allows one to approximate the actual oil recovery factor to design values, which is important for increasing the effi-ciency of production at the field and optimizing the use of re-sources.",

The region is rich in terms of geothermal resources and has convenient access to both public and ware transport, which are described as strengths of the resource. However, poor management and an excess of licensed geothermal fields weaken the effective consumption of the system. A huge number of projects have led to opposition from environmentalist groups.

Because of that, it is a reliable source of energy demonstrating great potential, which is still used to a small extent. Barriers to the wider use of geothermal energy include high investment costs, location constraints, and the quality of resources at various depths. Opposition from local communities is also a barrier. It results from low environmental awareness of geothermal opportunities, exacerbated by the lack of free access to good-quality geothermal spatial information. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess geothermal spatial information availability for selected geoportals using selected business tools and exploratory data analysis. The authors examined geoportals in terms of the information provided, the way it is presented, and the features available. They performed the assessment of their degree of similarity using competitive profile assessment, image graphs, cluster analysis, and affinity analysis. The research confirmed that the available spatial information is characterized by high variability, which indicates the lack of uniform rules for collecting, gathering, storing, and sharing geothermal data. The foregoing leads to information chaos, which can impede investors' investment decisions regarding implementing a geothermal installation on a property.",

    "abstract": "Since joint fissures are distributed extensively within rock masses, rock masses evolve into \"sandwich\" shapes when filled with joint fissures under long-term geological action, which causes rock discontinuities and destroys rock stability. This study reviews the advances in the shear-seepage properties of rock masses filled with joint fissures (RMFJFs) under static, quasistatic, and dynamic loads, including laboratory experiments, theoretical analysis, and numerical calculations. Results show that the shear properties of RMFJFs are closely associated with the strength of the fillings, the filling degree, and the roughness of the joints. RMFJFs develop under the stress of surrounding rocks, and their seepage properties are therefore affected by the surrounding stress and the filling degree, the rock layer thickness, and the porosity of the rock or fillings. However, detailed studies on the seepage properties of RMFJFs under cyclic loading, impact loading, and different shear rates are lacking. Finally, the existing problems in the research on the seepage properties of RMFJFs are clarified, a constructive research strategy is proposed, and the related trends are discussed in light of the overall mechanical behavior of RMFJFs.",

    "abstract": "In the face of the growing demands of the modern economy, 21st-century technology, and the challenges of Industry 4.0, the classical management of mining enterprises is not sufficient, and it is transforming into a process approach to the organization. The usage of the process management concept creates a situation for improving the organization at many levels, both at the strategy and operational levels. This provides an opportunity for a comprehensive view of the organization, but it is necessary to define indicators that determine the flexibility of operations, the achievement of profitability, and effective operational management. These indicators, called key performance indicators, focus on crucial aspects of the organization's activity that are fundamental to its current and future success. The contribution goal of the presented paper is to propose a new index for assessing the efficiency of coal mines, called the labor intensity index. The proposal is based on a previous three-area strategic analysis, including production indicators of coal mining companies, the state of coal mining in Poland, and economic factors affecting the current situation of the Polish coal mining industry. The analysis covered the period from 1988 to 2020. The use of new KPIs to assess performance in process terms is necessary to develop better new strategies for mining companies. It is particularly important in light of the industry's restructuring plans to restructure the mining industry and the far-reaching vision of decarbonizing the Polish energy sector.",

Results showed that the gold grade is 9.7 g/ton, the minerals are mainly silicates, and the pH of the ore is high, which means that without pre-treatment, i.e., roasting, oxidation, etc., it can be cyanided directly. Therefore, the CIL plant could recover more than 90% gold. In quality control of the plant, from each unit at a different time, a representative sample and an accumulative sample were collected and then subjected to analysis like fineness and solid percentage, moisture, and conditions of cyanidation.

This paper aims to improve initial valuations provided by real estate agents by updating their timeliness while also enhancing their accuracy. Leveraging statistical techniques based on hedonic regression, it introduces a novel mechanism, successive term indexing, enabling the reassessment of widely varying commercial properties with initial assessments that are at least one term old, where a term typically encompasses one year. The model's novelty lies in its approach to indexing individual property characteristics across two successive terms, using a k-means algorithm to categorize all numerical variables and stepwise selection. The former enables differing index values for varying sizes, while the latter allows dynamic evaluation of the significance of regressors in time. Applied to data from a banking institution, the model showcases strong predictive accuracy with unique reassessment ratios ranging from -3.8% to 5.2% for 2022. With its nuanced analysis of market dynamics and indexing capabilities, the mechanism intersects the elements of PPIs and AVMs, presenting a significant methodological advancement and a practical, simple-to-use tool for valuation.",

    "abstract": "Rising energy prices have become a focus of interest for politicians at the international, European, and national levels. Energy prices are the main determinant of profitability or even the existence of the industrial sector. So, it is accepted that energy policy aims to ensure a secure, sustainable, competitive, and affordable energy supply for households and businesses. However, the recent geopolitical situation has significantly affected the energy policy of the European Union, raising concerns about energy security and an energy crisis. This crisis has had social, economic, and political consequences, including energy poverty. In this context, it is essential to understand the determinants of the relationship between wholesale and retail energy prices. This paper presents a model proposal to be used by the Czech Energy Regulatory Authority. The model of average retail prices depends on the type of contract - spot or forward, with the three-year forward contract having the largest weight on the retail price. Therefore, our study shows that long-term contracts significantly impact retail energy prices, highlighting the importance of regulatory monitoring of market strategies. Methodologically, the model is based on a multivariate regression analysis solved with the least absolute deviations and data for the period 2012 to 2023. The findings of the study contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of the dynamics of energy prices and support policymakers while attempting to ensure energy affordability and sustainability.",

    "abstract": "In Soil Science, it is well established that the geometry of individual soil particles, including their shape and size, has a significant impact on a number of key physical properties of the soil and on the processes involved with it. The shape and size of soil particles directly impact aspects such as permeability, water retention, stability of soil aggregates and the availability of nutrients for plants. Therefore, accurate determination of these characteristics of soil particles becomes extremely important for understanding and effective soil management. Nowadays, dynamic image analysis (DIA) is emerging as an exceptionally versatile and effective technique that enables precise determination of particle characteristics, including shape and size, in a dynamic and non-invasive manner. DIA enables the automatic analysis of thousands of microscopic images, allowing rapid and accurate study of the morphology of soil particles at micro and macro scales. The use of dynamic image analysis in soil research provides insight into the complex structures of soil particles and better prediction of their impact on various soil processes. Moreover, DIA enables the examination of a large number of samples in a short time, which contributes to the efficiency and precision of soil testing. Therefore, dynamic image analysis is becoming a widely used technique for determining particles' characteristics, such as shape and size. In the context of an ever-increasing awareness of the sustainable use of natural resources and the need to optimize agricultural and engineering practices, dynamic image analysis is becoming an indispensable tool for soil scientists, environmental scientists and engineers. Its versatile use can contribute to further expanding our knowledge about soil and developing innovative solutions for sustainable soil and environmental management.",

When implemented effectively and designed professionally, HR marketing can give companies a significant competitive advantage in the labour market. Increasingly, HR managers and executives focus on securing high-quality and skilled employees who are integral to building a strong brand and employer value. To date, no studies have specifically examined HR marketing within the secondary sector, which appears to be stagnating in economically developed countries. This study aims to identify differences in the application of HR marketing tools among companies operating in the secondary sector, particularly within the mining, construction, and manufacturing industries. The research was conducted in two stages: the first stage involved an analysis of HR marketing practices among a sample of 215 companies operating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The second stage focused on a case study of 10 companies from the secondary sector, specifically three companies operating in the mining, construction, and manufacturing industries. This study offers a comparative analysis of HR marketing tool usage among companies within the secondary sector, including those in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The key findings address the research questions and hypotheses. The results indicate that companies in the secondary sector primarily use traditional HR marketing tools such as company websites, personnel agency services, and job portals. Mining and manufacturing companies employ a wider range of HR marketing tools to enhance employee loyalty than construction companies.",

Transitioning to a circular economy (CE) aligns with the SDGs, particularly through the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle (3Rs). This comparative analysis synthesises the contributions of multiple scholars, providing a cohesive understanding of current advancements and challenges in CE and sustainable resource management. Key themes include stakeholder collaboration, technological innovations, waste management, and policy frameworks. Effective waste management and valorisation of materials are highlighted, with significant advancements in electronic waste treatment, automotive shredder residue processing, and construction waste recycling. Moreover, the study emphasises the importance of cooperation through partnerships, as outlined in SDG17, and knowledge transfer in building trust within developed countries. The literature review reveals interactions between knowledge transfer components, such as research and development, foreign direct investment, and CE indicators, including circular material use rate and recycling rate. A bibliometric technique and VOSviewer were employed for visually representative and comprehensible literature analysis. The findings suggest that the integrated efforts of various stakeholders, technological advancements, and robust policy frameworks are essential for achieving a sustainable and circular future. By analysing these components, the research aims to evaluate the potential of EU member states to achieve sustainable development, providing valuable insights into the theoretical approaches and indicators used in CE and knowledge transfer studies.",

    "abstract": "Due to the simplicity of the design and high energy indicators, asynchronous electric motors (AM) are the main consumers in the power supply systems of mining enterprises. Large starting currents of motors lead to heating and damage to the insulation of the stator windings. An urgent problem to improve the reliability of mining and transport machines is the development of AM, providing smooth transients with increased starting torque and reduced starting current. In an AM with a closed-loop rotor, a magnetic conductor is performed by a charged cylinder on the rotor shaft, which is made of electrotechnical steel with high magnetic permeability. The electrical conductor is often a squirrel cage-type short-circuited rotor made of a material with high specific conductivity. A technology has been developed for producing ferro-copper alloys for the active outer cylinder of a double-layer rotor, replacing a \"squirrel cage\". These alloys combine the properties of an electric current conductor and a magnetic flux. This allows us to obtain the effect of displacement and reduction of current in the rotor, which is accompanied by an increase in the effective resistance of the rotor and the electromagnetic torque during the start-up process. Full-scale experiments have been carried out with asynchronous motors with various rotors having a displacement effect. Motors having double-cage or deep-groove rotors develop an increased starting torque at a relatively lower starting current. The starting quality of these motors is, on average, 1,5 times higher than that of a motor without current displacement. Replacing a double-cage rotor with a double-layer rotor leads to a decrease in the starting current by 25% and an increase in the starting torque by an average of 2,5 times. The quality factor of starting an asynchronous motor with a double-layer rotor is 3-4 times higher than the quality factor of starting similar motors with a conventional rotor cage without current displacement, 2-2,5 times compared with a double cage or a deep groove and 1,3-1,5 times compared with a rotor with a high electrical resistivity. The use of double-layer rotors limits voltage fluctuations in the network, ensures a reliable, smooth start, eliminates vibration and extends the service life of all equipment.",

    "abstract": "Technological development of mining equipment is largely initiated by the improvement of technologies and tools for its production, including in the field of surface treatment quality, which, in turn, determines the reliability and productivity of machines. The use of technical ceramics in designing parts and assemblies of mining machines allows for significantly improved technical and produc-tion characteristics since the quality of the parts' surface treatment is traditionally carried out with diamond-containing tools. The dia-mond tools with ceramic bonds have the highest grinding perfor-mance at the abrasive shaping of ceramics. The tribotechnical characteristics of tools made of a material with a ceramic structure hardened with microdipersed diamond grains are investigated in this work. On the basis of the classical approach to the deformation of rough surfaces, a model has been constructed that makes it possible to estimate the influence of the structural components of a dia-mond mineraloceramic tool on the wear of technical ceramics. The relations for calculation of grinding productivity, diamond content in the worn layer of the abrasive tool and the value of specific dia-mond consumption have been obtained. Experimental studies con-firmed the theoretical conclusions. It has been established that the greatest influence on grinding productivity is exerted by diamond granularity, loading and speed modes; diamond concentration significantly determines the relative wear resistance of the abrasive tool. The obtained relations will be useful in the design of diamond-containing tools for processing technical ceramics, which is increas-ingly used in the design of mining machines since its market is grow-ing dynamically around the world.",

    "abstract": "In this study, in particular, the relationship between high lithium values and geological environments was examined. To determine this, the geology, structural geology, hydrogeology, and hydrogeochemistry of the area in the north of the Gülşehir-Yeşilöz sub-basin of the Kızılırmak Basin were investigated. For hydrogeological studies, 19 water samples were collected in May and September. Tectonically, this area has a horst-graben structure. The relationships between the water analysis values of the study area and the tectonic areas were investigated. In particular, the lithium content of the waters in the study area was investigated. Hydrogeochemical properties and seasonal changes in water resources were studied in detail, and their relationship with tectonic areas was evaluated. Water analyses were carried out during wet and dry periods to determine temporal hydrogeochemical changes. According to the analysis, the waters in the area are of Ca-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-HCO3 facies. In addition, there are water samples with high lithium content in the study area. IDW and Kernel diagrams of these were prepared. It was found that these high values were influenced by the rocks formed in the ancient sea and saline lake environments. The region with the highest lithium value is in the formations that represent the former salt lake environment. High lithium (Li) values are generally higher in the region within the Kızılırmak graben. Lithium values in this area were determined as 241.3 µg/L, 154.5 µg/L, 155.2 µg/L, 156.8 µg/L, and 155.6 µg/L.",

    "abstract": "In this research, in order to compare and select the optimum patterns, two parameters of specific charge and specific drilling are used. Two explosive substances, including ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) and Amulet, are used to charge the holes located on the cross-section of the tunnels in order to advance by 3 meters. Also, the cross-section of the selected tunnels was 19, 28, 32, 40, 48, 50, 65, and 76 square meters with horseshoe, circle and D-shaped. The diameter of the explosive hole is 48 mm for the Norwegian method and 51 mm for the two energy balance models and the Swedish method to compare them. A total of 160 designs are prepared for three types of limestone, sandstone and marl. The results obtained for two parameters of specific charge and special drilling for the selected rock material are completely opposite. Also, in the Swedish methods, according to the Amulet, the values of the calculated parameters are close to the energy balance model. Finally, according to the geomechanical parameters of the rock, for the Swedish method and the energy balance model in charging with amulet explosives, the energy balance model and the Holemberg-Persson method are proposed in the optimal design for the tunnel drilling and blasting pattern. In addition, for the Norwegian method and the energy balance model in charging the holes with ANFO, the energy balance model is prior to the Norwegian method. The amount of stemming of holes in different parts of the tunnel face is less for the Swedish method than the Norwegian and energy balance models.",

    "abstract": "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has raised concerns regarding the stability of the global energy sector, considering that Russia is a big player in the industry, producing and exporting crude oil and natural gas globally. This study aimed to empirically investigate the impact of the conflict on the prices of energy sources in international markets. The analysis was conducted using secondary data. The data was for prices of various commodity products, including diesel, petroleum, natural gas, and crude oil. The data was collected on multiple international markets for periods from January 1, 2021 to November 30, 2023. The analysis was conducted using trend analysis and event study. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) was adopted to run the event study analysis. The results indicated that immediately after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, major energy products such as US crude oil, European crude oil, and the global energy index experienced a sharp rise in price, followed by significant price volatility over the following up to seven months. The review of OPEC energy prices also indicated an increase in prices, and volatility was experienced in countries producing and exporting oil products. The event study further revealed that there was a sharp increasing trend immediately after the event date and an upward trend for more than ten months after the event, resulting in the highest prices recorded in the event window. The study suggested three policy implications - conflict should serve as a wake-up call on diversification of energy sources, investment in alternative, sustainable and green sources of energy to reduce the dependence on oil, and promotion of international cooperation on energy security.",

    "abstract": "Sustainability in the mining industry continues to be a challenge. Although there is research in this area, there are still no solutions supporting the assessment of environmental impact in this sector. Therefore, it is important to look for and conduct various types of analyses that will be useful in this area. Therefore, the objective of the research was to analyse the ecological footprint of mining machines in the first phase of the LCA life cycle (obtaining and extracting materials). The analysis was based on the example of a hydraulic actuator, which is considered crucial to control machines in the mining industry. The ecological footprint burdens analysed included direct and indirect land take, sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and the use of nuclear energy. Life cycle assessment was carried out using the OpenLCA software with the ecoinvent v3.10 database. It has been shown that the largest amount of emissions occurs during off-site treatment of nonsulphide waste, cogeneration of heat and energy (hard coal), production of ferrochrome, high carbon, 68% Cr, and heat production in an industrial furnace using hard coal. It is proposed to carry out improvement activities that will first contribute to reducing the main environmental burdens. Then, it will be possible to significantly reduce the negative environmental impact of the hydraulic actuator's extraction and processing of materials. The results from the analysis may be useful not only for products from the mining industry but also in other areas of activity using this type of machine.",

This study aims to determine the robustness of the performance, considering the economic significance of these countries' natural resources. The daily data from the PSX 100 index (Pakistan Stock Exchange), BSE index (Bombay Stock Exchange), and DSE index (Dhaka Stock Exchange) for the years 2019 to 2021 has been obtained from their websites. The data is treated in MS Excel to compute the daily Geometric Returns for BSE, PSX, and DSE indices. Furthermore, the data were analyzed using the specialized package EViews for Time Series Graph, Descriptive Statistics, Unit Root Test, and GARCH Model. The findings of this research show that the BSE index has the highest return value of 6.78 percent compared with 4.56 percent and 3.75 percent for DSE and PSX, respectively. The Half-life model has been applied to calculate the volatility observed by the indices. The result shows that BSE is the most volatile and takes the highest time of 45 days to revert to its mean position, followed by PSX and DSE, which take 19 and 10 days, respectively. Therefore, investing in the BSE index is better for risk-lover investors. At the same time, DSE has the fastest mean reversion compared to the other two indices. Therefore, it is feasible for risk-averse investors.",

In the town of Solotvyno, in the western part of Ukraine, near the Romanian border, there is an abandoned salt deposit where salt was extracted in several mining operations. In 2010, the mine was closed, and mine chambers 7 and 8 were flooded with water, causing the collapse of this region. Since then, the extent of the damage has been increasing, with sinkholes steadily growing larger and larger, threatening not only the entire surface area around the quarry but especially the groundwater that connects the deposit to the Tisza River. Several research institutions have been involved in monitoring the shifts over time. We have monitored the karst by identifying the most dangerous areas of the earth's surface subject to vertical shifts - trench sinkholes by UAV survey and terrestrial measurements using precise levelling in 4 stages. The situation on the site is an emergency with a major ecological impact of salt contamination in the whole Upper Tisza Basin region and requires not only continuous geodetic, geological, and chemical monitoring but especially an urgent solution to reverse the state of damage to the region.",

    "abstract": "The mangrove ecosystem is a natural wetland located in the Red Sea that extends 500 km on the Egyptian western coast. It has great potential to sequestrate soil organic carbon, reduce atmospheric CO2, and enhance soil hydro-physical properties. In this context, this research aims to characterise soil changes induced by mangrove growing. Both modelling and measurements herein were performed on five sampling areas at the Western Strand of the Red Sea (plus one control site - beach without plants). The locations (sites 1 and 2) of mangrove forest were in El-Gouna village with ages of 10 and 5 years, respectively, while (sites 3, 4, and 5) represent mangroves at Hurghada, Abu-Monquar Island, and Safaga, respectively. The mean values of measured soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) at the soil surface (0-90cm) revealed that the lowest values of the SOCP were at Hurghada with 8.81± 0.12 Mgha-1 and the highest values at Abu Monquar island with 59.75 ± 0.15 Mgha-1. At El Gouna 1, 2 and Safaga, the SOCP values were 14.48, 12.86, and 39.98 Mgha-1, respectively. In addition, the SOCP at the control site (beach without plants) was 6.62± 0.25 Mgha-1. Thus, the mangrove ecosystem has a great potential to sequestrate the soil's organic carbon and reduce atmospheric CO2. Soil bulk density (SBD) values varied at El-Gouna1, 2, and Hurghada from 1.63 to 1.75 g/cm³, while the lowest SBD values were observed at Abu-Monquar Island and Safaga with 1.31± 0.02, g/cm³ and 1.53 ± 0.05 g/cm³, respectively. SBD at the control site was 1.75± 0.05 g/cm³, which reflects the higher values. Morphological characteristics reveal that tree height results varied from 110-130 cm, 50-70 cm, 150-200 cm, 200-300 cm, and 200-270 cm for ElGouna1, ElGouna2, Hurghada, Abu-Manqar, and Safaga, respectively. Higher values of tree height, size index, and density are convenient, as are the lower values of SBD at Abu-Monquar and Safaga compared to other site locations. The soil-water HYDRUS-1D model revealed that the soil water storage capacity at Abu-Monquar was higher than the other samples. Thus, the joint use of modelling and measurements enabled deeper insight and a suitable characterisation of soil physicochemical changes induced by mangrove growth.",

    "abstract": "Environmentally friendly conveyor belts are a modification of conventional conveyor belts. Conveyor belts of the Ecotubelt type enclosed in the shape of a pipe are the most important construction element of hose conveyors, which represent an ecological replacement of classic belt conveyors. Their closed conveyor belt in the shape of a hose allows you to transport material with minimal environmental pollution around the conveyor. A long-term problem for the users of these conveyor belts in the world is their maximum use with regard to their service life within the life cycle of the equipment that uses the conveyor belts. In order to achieve a sustainable quality of conveyor belts related to their service life, it is necessary to propose new procedures for evaluating the quality of conveyor belts in terms of their performance. The object of the research is closed conveyor belts of the Ecotubelt type with special construction. The aim of the research is aimed at gaining comprehensive knowledge about the performance of non-traditional closed conveyor belts in order to achieve their sustainable quality. The article presents a new approach to the evaluation of the quality of the Ecotubelt type conveyor belt using the concept of a knowledge system integrating multidisciplinary knowledge from rubber technologies, the results of laboratory and simulation experiments, as well as mathematical models. The integrated knowledge system includes quality-oriented subsystems within products, processes, services. The result of the model is an economic indicator (TCO) Total Cost Over ship index, which expresses the quality index for the purchase and use of a conveyor belt. The function of the proposed knowledge system for assessing the quality of the conveyor belt is to provide the user with adequate information from a huge amount of data and information, which will enable him to achieve a sustainable quality of classic open as well as closed conveyor belts.",

Based on our examinations on the field, we found that the asymmetrical valley sections, the tipped escarpments and the formation of the Kisgyőr Basin cannot be explained by the differences in the rock quality. The asymmetrical shape of these landforms and the stream captures identified in the research area indicate significant structural geological changes. In our work, we proved the asymmetry in the topography by performing swath profile analysis, and we also examined the elevation data of the areas covered by the welded ignimbrites of the Tar Dacite Tuff Formation. The results confirmed our field observations. We found that, contrary to the results of previous research, the geological structural processes played a fundamental role in the formation of the Kisgyőr Basin and its surroundings.",

    "abstract": "Publicly accessible caves are important objects of the modern form of tourism, which is called speleotourism. The caves are important underground geolocalities, which are characterized by a high accumulation of visitors in a specific natural environment. They are usually part of large protected areas - national parks and protected landscape areas. The study deals with accessible caves in the Low Tatras National Park in the central part of Slovakia. In the national park, or rather in its vicinity, there are four caves formed in the carbonate rocks of the geological core of the Low Tatras mountains. In the first part of the study, we presented their basic geographical characteristics in terms of their description as underground geolocalities. The main aim of the study is to analyze the number of visitors to the Demänovská Cave of Freedom, Demänovská Ice Cave, located directly in the national park, Bystrianska Cave located in the buffer zone of the national park and Važecká Cave, located on the northern edge of the studied area. Individual geolocalities were evaluated in terms of 12 criteria (e.g., Variety and attractiveness of cave decoration, Interpretation of the guide, Difficulty of the tour, Amount of ticket price, and others), which were indexed answers of (speleo)tourists from the opinion poll. We conducted the survey during the summer months in the period from 2010 to 2019, and a total of 160 respondents participated. The basic results of a standardized public opinion survey gave us the answer to five research hypotheses. The results confirmed the important potential of caves as specific geolocalities for the development of (underground) speleotourism as a modern form of tourism. Speleotourism is currently an important form of tourism, which is developing in the national parks.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of linear features such as faults, valleys, interfluves, and escarpments is a commonly used method in structural morphologic and structural geologic research. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between the linear features by directional statistical analysis, and we also examined the applicability of this method in a research area with a complex geological structure. The study area was the Bükk Mountains (NE Hungary) and its two catchment areas. The analysed features (drainage network, lineaments and dominant aspect) were derived from a DEM. As a result of the research, we found that in the Sajó catchment, the direction of lineaments does not coincide with the direction of the valleys and structural elements, nor the dominant aspect, while in the Tisza watershed, the orientation of the main structural features notably differs from the direction of the other 3 feature sets. In our opinion, this finding can be explained in three possible ways. The first possibility is that the applied method does not provide reliable results in a geologically complex area. The second explanation is that regional structural processes may affect drainage network evolution and the dominant aspect. The other explanation is that there may have been unknown structural elements in the research area, which affect the recent geomorphological settings and processes. The results draw attention to the fact that besides the unmapped faults, there might be other factors affecting geomorphological processes (e.g., resistance to denudation of different rock types, microclimate), which have not been taken into account so far. The research was based only on directional statistical examinations; further geological and geophysical analyses are required to prove the existence of these hypothetical morphotectonic features.",

For the purpose of dendrochronological analysis, Tree-ring samples were collected using increment borers and measured by Velmax measuring system. The previous hydrological data ranging from 23 to 55 years of the same tributaries were collected from Water and Power Development Authority, Pakistan and Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO). Both dendrochronological and obtained hydrological data have been applied to reconstruct the long-term hydrological data of more than 200 years. The reconstructed hydrological data has been used for hydel power potential estimation of all studied tributaries. The current investigation presented the same pattern of flow rate and power potential in existing and reconstructed hydrological data with minor variances. The findings of this research demonstrate that reconstructed hydrological data can be obtained by using existing hydrological and dendrochronological data, and it can act as the best source to measure the expected flow rate and hydropower potential.",

    "abstract": "Recovery of hydrocarbon is an important aspect of the O&amp;G industry, which has gained much importance in recent times. It can be achieved through a set of activities and decisions in which successfully drilling the oil/gas deposits is very important. Drilling is a critical step in the exploration process, and it has a high level of risk in terms of cost, timeline, safety, and project completion. The study focuses on identifying, evaluating and estimating unforeseen events that may occur during the drilling projects. The methodology acquired for this paper includes a thorough focus on the literature review which has been done. It consists of a model/theory related to risk management and the concept of risk management processes. A comprehensive project life cycle model with six stages has correlated with the drilling phases. Detailed risk management has been practised for an integrated risk portfolio for the development project. A generalized risk identification approach has been utilized to recognize possible threats. A qualitative risk assessment has been executed for the findings. Impact and probability benchmarks are categorized per the past historical well's performances and published data. Considering the importance of risk management for said projects, the study focused on the literature review that highlights the processes, procedures, and models for drilling risk management. Risks have been recognized through a rigorous and comprehensive risk identification process and have been evaluated with the qualitative risk assessment approach. The risk register for development drilling projects has been developed along with the risk matrix as per the defined criteria of risk impact and probability for drilling. Furthermore, a detailed risk breakdown structure has been formulated according to the general area categorization to enlighten the risks focused on each area of interest. Overall, the study will provide a value-added and detailed risk management approach for new ventures, which may be planned with the implementation of comprehensive drilling risks management.",

The effective factors - slope, aspect, plan curvature, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), slope length (LS), lithology, distance to rivers, distance to ridge-lines, distance to faults, and distance to lithological borders - were derived from a spatial database. Using these effective factors, groundwater spring potential was calculated using a single model, and the results were plotted in ArcGIS. The final result indicated that the bivariate statistical index model (like FR) could be used as a simple tool in the assessment of groundwater spring potential.",

    "abstract": "In the body balance process control, a variety of postural strategies for balance recovery are used. Postural strategies are automatic stable muscular patterns. Such a mechanism reduces the degrees of freedom number, simplifies, speeds up the posture adjustment, and minimizes energy expenditure. They relate to the existence of some motor coordination sets and describe three mobility strategies: ankle, hip, and step strategy. The hip strategy occurs when interference is greater or the use of the ankle strategy is impossible, for example, due to the delay of the postural information cycle. From a dynamical systems point of view, a human attempting to balance upright on an unstable balance board represents the coupling of two dynamical systems, the human balance system with neuromuscular feedback supported on the balance board (an inverted pendulum). The coupling of these two dynamical systems, with time delay and nonlinearities, creates an ideal setting for the emergence of complex postural behaviour and unanticipated interactions between the individual, task, and the external dynamical system. The article presents an analysis of the pendulums concerning the issue of maintaining balance by man.",

    "abstract": "The increasing global demand for graphite and environmental issues due to the extraction of natural graphite has become motivations to improve the process development of synthetic graphite. However, the conventional process for synthetic graphite production requires high temperatures, extreme process conditions, and expensive equipment. This drives further research work on finding more straightforward options. This research study a simpler direct transformation method using Palm Kernel Shell (PKS), Oil Palm Fond (OPF, Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) as carbon precursors via a catalytic graphitization process. The process involved raw material preparation, carbonization process, Iron-Silica catalyst impregnation and graphitization. Three parameters were observed, including graphitization temperature, type of raw material and amount of Iron catalyst loadings. The Bio-synthetic graphite produced were later undergone an “improved method” to form Graphene Oxide (GO). The graphitic carbon produced was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) Surface Area and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM). Overall successful transformation of amorphous carbon to graphitic structure for PKS, EFB, and OPF was evidenced by the XRD pattern and Raman spectra. It was found that PKS was the greatest carbon precursor for the graphitization process, followed by EFB and OPF. The former exhibited the nearest interlayer spacing to natural graphite with the lowest Id/Ig value. This can be seen from the HRTEM image of the PKS-1300-40 sample. The results attributed to the highest percentage of lignin in PKS rather than in EFB and OPF. A very significant transformation of bio-synthetic graphite to GO powder was also evidenced in XRD patterns and RAMAN spectroscopy. As for bio-synthetic graphene PKS, EFB and OPF depicted XRD patterns with broad peak centring around 2𝜃~25°. It was found an absence of GO characteristic peak at 2𝜃~10.7°.",

Technological advancements in distributed ledger technology eliminate the downsides of physical gold we were exposed to in the past. In this article, we analyze the relationship between the gold price and inflation and ask whether gold is suitable as an alternative means of payment. Regarding the mentioned tokenization possibility, gold fulfils all the functions to become a means of payment. We tested the value storage capability of gold. This was tested by relating gold as a protection against inflation to HICP in regression analyses and mean comparisons. A total of six hypotheses were tested, of which three could be rejected. The existing literature mainly focuses on testing the correlation between gold and other assets to verify its safe haven property. A part of this paper tests the regression relationship in which the dependent variable is represented by gold, and the independent variable is represented by inflation. Under this methodology, we demonstrated that a stable, statistically significant positive relationship exists when using log gold prices and log HICP values.",

    "abstract": "The current stage of subsurface use development is accompanied by an annual increase in post-mining territories. This is partly due to a change in funding priorities in this area and their widespread reorientation to the search for alternative sources of raw materials to ensure the development of modern high-tech industries. One of the biggest threats to the environment in this development is the deterioration of the freshwater quality due to poor management of abandoned mining areas. And one of the most significant problems is often created by acid mine drainage. As a part of the study, information on the current environmental state of a past American mining territory located near Basin, Montana, USA, was analyzed and summarized; a conceptual exposure model was created regarding the studied natural and technogenic interactions; systematization and data updating on temporal and spatial changes in the qualitative characteristics of surface waters that are in direct contact with the abandoned mine were carried out; the level of efficiency of implemented reclamation works on the territory was determined. The results of the water quality environmental assessments proved that the measures taken thus far are absent of a sufficient level of effectiveness for its full rehabilitation. To accelerate the process of changing the water quality of the investigated water object, both in terms of condition and degree of purity, a combination of a passive treatment system coupled with an artificial reduction of acid mine drainage volumes was suggested.",

    "abstract": "Surface plants in mines are important parts of a mine operation. There exist offices, common areas, repair and maintenance shops, compressed air facilities, hydraulic facilities, areas where mine machinery and parts are stacked, transportation cranes and mine stock areas in surface plants. Therefore, while the mining operations are continuing, it is necessary to control all the work in the surface plants in terms of work safety and health. In this study, the risk matrix method is used to identify and prioritize the risks of surface plants in a mine. Then, the highest priority risk, which is found to be \"Stock area and work environment\", is considered using bowtie analysis. Four threats are determined for \"Stock area and work environment\" risk. These are improper ore or coal stock area, insufficient lighting in night works, lack of maintenance of field crane and dusty work environment. These threats are also modelled using bowtie analysis. As a result of this study, these threats, corresponding barriers and consequences can be managed by safety and operational engineers.",

    "abstract": "Clogging of the steel in the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) is mainly due to the agglomeration and/or interaction of the steel with the SEN refractory material. However, the continuous casting steel also leads to clogging - the freezing of the steel in the SEN at the beginning of the casting. The freezing of the steel in the SEN results mainly in the change in the geometry, the low casting temperature of steel, the insufficient preheating of the SEN and the low initial casting speed. To eliminate the problems of steel freezing at the beginning of continuous casting, the authors solved them using a mathematical model of heat transfer in the SEN. Using the mathematical model, it is possible to simulate the layout of temperatures in the SEN and the temperature of the steel at the interface of steel - the inner surface of the SEN. To determine the temperature layout in the SEN after installation on the tundish, a method of measuring the decreased average temperatures of the SEN by free convection after heating was used. Based on the analysis of the current state using simulations in a mathematical model, it is possible to define conditions for preventing the freezing of steel in the SEN when the wall thickness or isolation thickness is changing.",

FLAC3D was utilized to build the calculation model, and Tecplot was employed to process data of the results, revealing the characteristics of stress variation in coal seam for different cavitation radius and different distribution forms of cavitation. The field test scheme of HCTBSC was determined to verify the simulation results. Results show that the effectiveness of stress relief (ESR) is controlled by the cavitation radius and cavitation distribution forms. The dimension of pressure relief emanates via the cavitation elongating outward with the cavitation radius, and the stress changes in the coal are different due to different cavitation distribution forms. The field test proves that the technology of HCTBSC is more effective in relieving pressure, increasing the productiveness of gas extraction, and decreasing the scourge of coal and gas protrusion.

The analysis of the risk dependency on vulnerabilities and threats to ACSMIC assets is carried out, and the relationship between risk, vulnerability, and threat is presented according to a three-level risk assessment scale. When identifying and assessing the risk, existing countermeasures against both external and internal attacks are taken into account, which, in turn, reduces the risk level for the protected organization. In the process of any organization functioning, there may be a need to reassess the risk associated with changes in the structure of the control organization or security policy in the system of the metallurgical industry companies. Therefore, the existing countermeasures are closely related to the concept of risk and require constant correction in the assessment process. Risk is related to the reliability of the functioning of the studied control structure of units and aggregates and their ability to function in accordance with the mode and goals of the production structure in various branches and levels of the hierarchy with an acceptable risk assessment. On the basis of the system concepts and assessment methods of the acceptable risk level, the system-oriented method of identifying the reliability of functioning of self-recovering complex hierarchical structures is proposed, the classification of the risk types of unforeseen situations in complex human-oriented systems that can be applied and implemented in hierarchical control systems is carried out.",

Nevertheless, the number of high-energy tremors remains at a similar level or decreases much slower than production. We analyze this problem in the aspect of geological setting and on the base of geodetic data. We explain the paradox by specific interaction between man-induced and natural tectonic stress as seasonal hydrological effects. Anomalous energies released during large seismic events exceeded the predetermined threshold, typical for mining tremors in the area. Further, the authors point out the seasonal occurrence of these events. Temporal variations of distances between continuously operating GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) reference stations were analyzed, and linear strain, inferred from these geodetic observations, corresponded to high-energy tremors in the area. Consequently, the seismic events usually occurred when the analyzed baseline performance demonstrated significant seasonal increases or decreases of evaluated temporal distribution of strain. The aim of the analysis was to evaluate the relationships between the characteristics of the time series of deformations and the occurrence of seismic tremors of energy E ≥ 3 x 107J occur. Seasonal occurrences of high-energy seismic events as the energy they released suggest the influence of environmental factors.",

One ton of red sludge on dry bases has come out as a bauxite residue in the course of 1 ton of alumina and 0.5 tons of aluminum production respectively. Especially the high liquid ratio significantly reduces the life of the red sludge dam used as a disposal area. In this study, alternative techniques have been investigated to improve the dewatering performance of red sludge in ETI Aluminum Inc. For this purpose, the vacuum rotary drum filter, decanter centrifuge, and filter press methods have been searched, and the effects on ETI red sludge dewatering properties have been obtained. The dewatering studies have been performed not only at the laboratory scale but also at the pilot scale to determine the optimum technique and to achieve the most efficient performance. As a result of dewatering the 30% solids red sludge with vacuum rotary drum filter, decanter centrifuge, and press filter methods, solids ratios of 48%, 65%, and 70% were obtained, respectively. While the amount of caustic in the red sludge produced by the present method was between 1.5 and 3%, the amount of caustic remaining in the cake was reduced to 0.22%, 0.15%, and 0.95%, respectively, by vacuum filtration, decanter centrifuge, and press filter methods. Thus, reducing the amount of caustic in the red sludge has reduced its negative impact on the environment, and a significant amount of caustic has been recovered.",

Using the ARFIMA model and log-periodogram regression technique, we estimate the long memory parameter in energy price indices. Our findings confirm the persistence in energy prices, indicating that past price movements have a lasting impact on future prices. For market participants, understanding the persistence of energy prices is crucial for developing effective trading strategies and risk management measures. The long-lasting effects of past price movements suggest the need for preparedness in the face of extended periods of price volatility. Policymakers can also benefit from this knowledge by implementing measures to stabilize energy markets and mitigate the impacts of price shocks. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of incorporating the persistence of shocks in energy price forecasting models. By accounting for the long-lasting effects of past price movements, these models can improve the accuracy of price forecasts and aid in decision-making for market participants. While our study provides valuable insights into the persistence of energy prices, further research is needed to investigate the root causes of persistence and its implications in a rapidly changing global economic environment. Additionally, exploring the individual factors that influence energy price indices can enhance our understanding of their dynamics and improve prediction accuracy. Overall, our findings contribute to the existing literature by confirming the presence of persistence in energy prices and providing valuable insights for market participants and policymakers. Further research in this area can offer more pragmatic advice and enhance decision-making in the energy markets.",

Results of research on the Triassic limestone samples using this method are presented there. The samples were taken from the area of Opole Silesia in Poland. It is a Polish part of the Germanic Basin. X-ray diffraction was used to identify the following phases: low-Mg calcite, high-Mg calcite, dolomite, and huntite. Low-Mg calcite dominates in the limestones. In some samples, there is also a lower amount of high-Mg calcite. Moreover, dolomite and huntite were identified. The study results have shown that X-ray diffraction is the perfect method to identify carbonate phases with different magnesium content. Limestone, including carbonates rich in magnesium, can be used as a fertilizer, animal feed additive, sorbent to desulfurize flue gases or material in road building. The research results indicate the possibility of application of the Muschelkalk limestones rich in magnesium from the area of Opole Silesia in different branches of industry.

Characterization studies were performed by AAS, XRF and XRD analysis to assess the abundance of elements and mineral phases. In addition, the acidity of the ore was examined to estimate the effective amount of lime. The ore was subjected directly to cyanidation without any pre-treatment. High oxidation reagent processes were carried out to pre-treat the ore. Chemical analysis results show the gold grade to be 1.37 g/t. In addition, the ore contained 51.78% Fe2O3, 43.40% SO3, 2.39% CuO, 1.47% SiO2, 0.35% Cr2O3, 0.17% CaO, 0.08% As2O3, 0.06% ZnO and 0.06% MnO. The XRD result shows that the ore phases are Pyrite (FeS2), Chatkaite (Cu6Fe+2Sn2S2) and Quartz (SiO2). The investigations of direct cyanidation elucidated that the ore can consume a high amount of cyanide with unsatisfactory recoveries for gold (Exgold ≤39.41%). The influence of the cyanide concentration, pulp density (% by weight), leaching time hr, agitator speed and pH were examined in direct cyanidation experiments. In pre-treatment experiments, the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and concentrations on gold recovery was studied. The pre-treatment of the ore with H2O2 achieved a good impact on the gold extraction performance. The higher gold extraction was obtained at hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 300 ppm, cyanide concentration 3500 ppm, leaching time 10 hr, pH=10.5 and pulp density 40%.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research work is to study the main aspects of catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons on modified natural zeolite of the Shankanai deposit (Kazakhstan) with heteropoly acids. The leading methodological approach in this research work is a combination of a systematic analysis of the main aspects of performing catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons with a practical study of the features of the functioning of the Shankanai deposit for obtaining and further practical use of modified natural zeolite and involving scientific experiments to determine the prospects for performing this kind of modifications, for the subsequent use of these zeolites in the processes of catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons. The results obtained in this scientific study are clear evidence of the fact that more light oil fractions are obtained as a result of the catalytic cracking process using modified natural zeolites as a catalyst than as a result of thermal cracking under other similar initial conditions. The results obtained in this research work and the conclusions formulated on their basis are of significant practical importance from the standpoint of the prospects for the development of the Shankanai deposit and the use of the zeolite extracted from it after its modification in the processes of catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons.",

    "abstract": "Having abandoned mine workings, the closure strategy of mine working openings is important in terms of maintaining long-term stability. The paper describes the process of closing the mine workings in the uranium deposit Rožná using unconsolidated backfill. Before backfilling, it is vital to carry out preparatory work underground for ecological, technological or economic reasons. The mine workings backfilling using unconsolidated backfill is preceded by calculations to determine the quantity of the backfill. The stability of the mine workings opening is achieved using a closing sinking platform made of reinforced concrete. The abandonment procedure is framed within the legislation of the Czech Republic, grounded in the handbook by the National Coal Board of Great Britain (NCB, 1982), and has been gradually amended according to the experience with disused mine workings. The Czech legislation dealing with mine abandonment is very advanced and may be applied to modify foreign legislation. The abandonment procedure based on Decree 52 (1997) proposed in this paper is complemented by safety features such as micropilots in the sinking platform or shaft lining check-up before the backfill. The proposed method is applicable in mines with analogous specific conditions, such as mines free of gas hazards and coal dust. The paper concludes with an analysis of risks likely to occur due to incorrect mine closures.",

    "abstract": "Today, almost all large cities have a landfill for municipal solid waste, where solid waste is dumped, stored and partially disposed. Storage and disposal of household waste (mainly by burning) can negatively impact the structure, productivity indicators, and the agroecological state of the soil cover common around the landfill. Such high levels of heavy metals and metalloids in household waste ash, in turn, lead to soil contamination around the landfill. The reason is that the process of incineration and open storage of waste has a very negative impact on the environment. It should be noted that the level of heavy metal contamination of the soil around the domestic landfill is low. However, failure to fully comply with the measures for storage and disposal of waste can lead to contamination of soils around the landfill with heavy metals since the content of heavy metals in ashes is very high. Soil pollution with household waste affects all processes occurring in it and has a detrimental effect on the activity of living organisms living in the soil. In particular, soil pollution with household waste changes the amount of organic volatile compounds in the organic part of the soil. Studies have shown that benzofuran organic volatile compounds not found in background soils can be found in soils around municipal waste when exposed to pollution. Some compounds, such as carbonic acid-10.99% and di-n-desylsulfone-0.47%, which are noted in the background soils, were not found in soil sample No. 1 taken at the landfill. These compounds are removed from the soil as a result of waste incineration and other processes.",

    "abstract": "The latest capital market crises are not the first and the last we will experience. These events of the previous decades led investors to diversify their portfolios with precious metals. As a result, the prices for raw materials, auxiliary materials, and operating materials have risen very strongly. As a result, companies are required to apply various hedging strategies to hedge production costs. This paper presents a hedging strategy based on volatility, which allows hedging against falling commodity prices. This paper deals with developing a new volatility-based hedging strategy for metals. The focus is on hedging against falling prices. The newly developed Foreshock-Vola-based strategy outperformed the 200-day MA strategy. It must be noted that this is the first study on the presented model due to the newly developed methodology. In this respect, it is recommended for further contributions that the investigation period be divided into individual years, and thus, the respective under - or outperformance of the vola-based hedging strategy compared to the 200-day MA be investigated separately.",

The stability of the slope was analysed by the discrete element method (DEM) PFC2D and the Limit equilibrium method GEO 5. The results show that the hazardous area is not only concentrated on the surface of the waste dump's slope but also in the consolidation pressure of the soil-rock mixture slope, which has the weakest consolidation strength, making it prone to sliding.",

    "abstract": "Roads and railway lines are often constructed on different geotechnical structures such as tunnels, cuttings, and/or embankments. Three main parts are necessary to consider to evaluate vibration: the source of vibrations, vibration propagation path, and receiver of the signal. This paper describes a review of the influence of train-generated vibrations on an embankment and a building in the surroundings. The first presented case study documents an interpretation of seismic signal in the frequency domain using wavelet transform. The algorithm, which we apply to the computation of the wavelet transform of the velocity component record, is based on the pyramidal algorithm, and the result of this procedure is used for an interpretation of data. The discrete wavelet transform was applied to the construction of a 3-dimension mapping of the time-frequency decomposition. An example of the numerical model on the FEM method (the MIDAS GTS software) shows the vertical displacement of the embankment body during the movement of a train. The creation of these models is strictly based on the results of experimental seismological measurements. Then, the source of vibration is represented by a typical train/vehicle that runs on the nearest part of the railway/road at the most efficient velocity.",

Maintenance benchmarking is a process used by organizations to evaluate and improve their maintenance practices and performance by comparing them to industry standards or best practices. The goal of maintenance benchmarking is to identify areas for improvement, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The changing environment of small and medium-sized enterprises in recent years has produced new pressures and concerns. In this present environment and in the future, successful companies will be those that can continually improve and adapt their services to meet and exceed the demands of stakeholders. The goal of the improvement might concern the actual quality of the state of the environment in one case, whereas in another case, the focus could be on environmental costs or the satisfaction of the citizens with environmental services. The benchmarking type used and the benchmarking objectives will influence the criteria for choosing benchmarking partners. Benchmarking is currently one of the most effective industrial performance improvement processes. In this regard, benchmarking, formal and structured observation, and exchanging ideas between organizations may prove to be valuable tools.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three years, many unprecedented events have happened which have significantly influenced the whole world. This paper deals with several topical issues, such as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Brent's oil prices, on the price of plastics, specifically polyolefins, i.e., polyethene and polypropylene, price trends of petroleum products, in different crisis periods from 2006 to the present and predicts the price trend of petroleum products (polyolefins) using artificial intelligence. In the application part of the research, the following research methods were used: time series regression using neural networks and correlation and regression analysis. Neural networks confirmed a significant effect of the coronavirus pandemic on Brent's oil price. Correlation analysis showed a long-term comparable trend in the development of Brent oil and polyolefin prices, which is a confirmation of the significant impact of COVID-19 on the price of polyethene and polypropylene. The greatest benefit of this research for the application sphere is the prediction of the price development of polyolefins. All generated variants of the ANS neural network module predict a decreasing trend of polypropylene and polyethene prices until the end of 2023. The conducted research on the prices of polyolefins is a unique study with practical benefits for companies producing the most in-demand material in the world – plastic. Analysing and predicting the price development of the commodities under study can be useful for entities in their strategic assessment and subsequent investment decisions. A limitation of the research is the ongoing war conflict in Ukraine, as the oil market is sensitive to political conflicts and becomes difficult to control and predict.",

As a model, we chose two companies operating in the given industry and investigated what factors affect the calculation of their market value. Available data from the financial statements of these mining companies (KSR – Kameňolomy SR, s. r. o., Eurovia – Kameňolomy SR, s. r. o.) for the years 2018 to 2022 were used for the calculation, based on which the planned data for the years 2023 to 2027 were then determined. Exploring the possibility of entering a partnership with another company brings many opportunities but also risks. In conclusion, we analyze the number and value of mergers occurring between 2015 and 2021 in Slovakia, within the Visegrad 4 group, in Europe and in the world. In conclusion, we will evaluate the development of mergers and acquisitions in the years 2022 and 2023 in Central and Eastern Europe, especially Slovakia. Finding a reliable partner is difficult, and there is no definite guide, but it is possible to acknowledge when and why doing business on a partnership basis is more advantageous and efficient if the merger is professionally prepared.",

(2014).This methodology is ideal to answer the asymmetric effect on the independent variable on the dependent variable.Furthermore, we also applied asymmetric Granger causality introduced by Hatemi-J (2012) to confirm the causal relationship between the variables.The results of NARDL affirmed that all the variables have a significant impact on natural resources rent.The findings confirm that negative shocks of urban intensity decrease the natural resources rents; however, the positive shocks increase the rents of natural resources.On the one hand, the positive and negative shocks of GDP increase the natural resources though, the magnitude of positive shocks are significantly different from the negative shocks.On the other hand, the results of asymmetric Granger causality confirm that positive and negative shock of urban intensity does granger cause positive shocks of natural resources.Whereas, positive shocks of natural resources (economic growth) have a causal connection with positive and negative shocks of economic growth (natural resources) in Indonesia.",

    "abstract": "Discontinuities represent a significant role in the deformation of foundation bedrocks and the stability of many slopes. Moreover, assessing and analyzing the different slope failures through fieldwork and laboratory tests of the intact rock mass is important to determine discontinuities' geometrical and geo-engineering parameters. The Northern Galala Plateau is considered a typical case study of instability problems due to excessive bedrock discontinuities. The present study deals with the mapping and assessment of bedrock (Paleozoic sandstones) discontinuities using structural mapping/analysis and geotechnical qualifications as an integrative approach. The study was started by collecting structural data, joint surveying and delineating fault zones as well as highly fractured zones. In addition, the geotechnical qualifications and stability of slopes were assessed using kinematic analysis and Rock Mass Rating (RMR) of discontinuity sets at the lower slope. Quantitative descriptions and statistical distribution of fractures at the study site were well defined. The kinematic analysis of sandstone bedrock masses revealed wedge and/or toppling failures which are controlled by uncomplimentary discontinuities. As a result, RMR values suggested the majority of foundation bedrock is classified as good rock II category, whereas RMR for the fault zone is classified as fair rock III category. Furthermore, discontinuities could not necessarily lead to instability problems during and after construction. The present study highlights the influence of integration between both structural and geotechnical techniques for suitability assessment in development processes which in turn could provide important keys for decision-makers.",

Combined with the catastrophe theory, the evaluation system of the foundation stability was constructed. Using the self-developed similar model test and rainfall device, the deformation stability of the foundation under the condition of heavy rainfall and dynamic loading of the high-speed railway was analyzed. Results show that the maximum influence depth of the dynamic loading and heavy rainfall on the foundation is about 20 m, and the further compaction of the foundation cracks is the main factor leading to the subsidence of the foundation above the mined-out area. In addition, the increase of the number of longitudinal tensile cracks in the foundation, which gradually plays a dominant role in the new cracks, shows an exponential growth trend. Being affected by the continuous heavy rainfall, the deformation evolution of the foundation displays four stages: the initial stabilization, the slow deformation, the first sudden-jump, and the secondary sudden-jump stages. Among them, the surface's maximum deformation occurs in the secondary sudden jump stage. The conclusions obtained in this study provide a theoretical basis for the stability evaluation and treatment of the foundation of the high-speed railway above the mined-out area.",

Along with the growth of the massive oil production, the role of the Peninsula has increased and big ecological problems have arisen. In this research, the investigation of the possibility of detecting hydrocarbons in sandy soil through Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 A satellite and drone images and chemical analysis was conducted. The main study was based on the satellite imagery of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A, employing NDVI calculations and analyses. In order to calculate NDVI, ESRI ArcGIS 10.3 software has been used. The multispectral images with 30m spatial resolution of Landsat 8 and 10 m resolution multispectral images of Sentinel 2 were used. Additionally, drone observations lead to obtaining high-resolution data about soil pollution in the study area. Also, field samples were taken to the laboratory and necessary chemical analysis was performed for validation purposes. This study showed that multispectral remote sensing can be used to detect hydrocarbons in the soil in oil production areas. Hydrocarbon-bearing substances’ absorption into the soil results in a low value of NDVI in the study area. The observations in the winter and summer seasons show that the seasonal changes in weather conditions affect both the amount of oil contamination in the soil and the detection process of soil pollution by oil using remote sensing.",

The monitored company uses a large number of reports in connection with the organization of the company. They collect many data from the attendance system and the electronic resource planning system, but also a lot of operational data related to the performance of mining mechanization. These data are evaluated in the company only at one-month intervals. Our intention was to transform the data for the year 2021 and create various visual reports through the power BI program, which, thanks to detailed analysis and evaluation, will help to improve the management of mining mechanization. The source of information in our case were tables that contained very poorly arranged data that could not be imported into the Power BI program in the given state. After collecting the data, we had to transform them, which was a very time-consuming process. Due to limited resources, we had to adjust our original plan. From the entire portfolio of mining mechanization, which consists mainly of mining drills, loaders and trucks, we decided to only process data from mining trucks. The result will be a demonstration of the usability of the power BI system in a mining company to manage information related to mining trucks, but the same approach can be used for all types of mining mechanisms. Implementation of the power BI system was performed on data from one of the biggest underground mines in Slovakia.",

The proposed measurement construct can be instrumental for further research of knowledge transfer from international collaborating companies of different capital origins for the mining industry sector since raw materials industries encounter new performance challenges in the context of the war in Ukraine, which caused a severe energy crisis.",

    "abstract": "Innovation convergence is a deterministic process resulting from the change in micro and macro innovation determinants. It is characterized by firms' search for innovative opportunities in other economic sectors and in their development from mining through heavy industry to material processing sector, discovering new technologies that connect individual products to a more integrated global system, diversifying, ensuring technical scope growth, and start-ups contributing to new managerial leadership. The aim of this study is to contribute to our knowledge of convergence innovation by providing empirical evidence on it. To this purpose, we use a nonlinear time-varying factor model to test for convergence innovation and countries' club clustering. For the sample of 29 countries from 1995 to 2017, we identify two significant convergence clubs and one divergent group (Cyprus, Czech Republic, and The Netherlands). The empirical evidence indicates that innovation singularity could appear as a significant barrier and limiting factors for firms' and countries' growth in the future. Design and new product development trends in these countries follow a different decoupling path from the rest of the sample. Policymakers and practitioners should carefully evaluate innovation determinants and constraints (decoupling drivers) in setting up innovation policies on a micro and macro level.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on identifying zones and karstic phenomena using the RS &amp; GIS method along with Fuzzy logic integration and the Hierarchical Analysis Process (AHP) in part of Neka catchment in Mazandaran province in the north of Iran. In this research, eight lithological factors, density and distance from the fractured lineaments, density and distance from the drainages, topographic slope, precipitation and vegetation status, were extracted from satellite and archival data as well as field data. Then these factors which affect karst formation and development are fuzzy and are weighted by the AHP method and integrated with T-norm, T-conorm (S-norm) and Compromise Operators. The results were processed by using software such as ArcGIS, ENVI, RockWorks, IDRISI, Expert Choice and PCI Geomatica, which were evaluated based on fieldwork. The results of this study show that most karst developments occurred in Lar Formation with the upper Jurassic. According to field visits, the best and most appropriate output for fuzzy layers integration are the use of a compromise operator in the range of 0.9 to 0.95. In spite of the suitable ability of Landsat 8 bands to extract lineaments due to vegetation status and other environmental conditions, the use of DEM was also necessary. This study shows that the use of new remote sensing and GIS technology, combined with Fuzzy logic and AHP, increases accuracy and speed and reduces cost in karst studies.",

However, these environmentally unfriendly materials can be used as a raw material for alkali activation – geopolymerization. Although these wastes have been successfully used in industrial production for several decades, its use does not achieve the level of its potential. Today, to achieve a sustainable construction industry, alternative cement has been extensively investigated. Geopolymer (GP) is a kind of material that is obtained from the alkaline activator, and it can be produced from industrial wastes or by-products. The aim of this work was to describe the improvement of mechanical properties of alkali-activated binders – geopolymers made of fly ash and blast furnace slag. The effect of the addition of waste glass in three different values feed into fly ash or GGBFS, and its impact on mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strengths) of geopolymers was examined. The highest value of compressive strength was achieved with 20% waste glass addition to a fly ash sample on 90th day 58,9 MPa. The waste glass was added in the form of broken and crushed glass particles.",

    "abstract": "Throughout human history, gold has been the most sought-after and well-known precious metal in the world. It is synonymous with wealth in the financial market and jewellery. However, its use has a wide range of applicability in biomedicine, electronic engineering and other industries. Primary gold resources are limited and have been significantly depleted in recent decades. To cover the current demand, it is necessary to process secondary sources containing gold such as heaps, tailings, lean ores or electrical waste. New and especially more efficient technological procedures are needed for the processing of these secondary sources. From an environmental point of view, a hydrometallurgical process is considered to be more appropriate than a pyrometallurgical process, in which very toxic fumes enter the air. This work investigates the leaching of gold from flotation wastes using thiourea. It is flotation waste that is the target group of materials that are a source of precious metals. An interesting gold content is present in our waste sample (Hodruša Hámre tailings pond), but its evaluation depends on the setting of suitable technological conditions. In this work, thiourea is used as an alternative leaching agent to toxic cyanide, which is banned in Slovakia and many countries around the world due to its high environmental risk. The results of the study are described with respect to the gold recovery under optimized thiourea leaching conditions.",

    "abstract": "Seek for new Rare Earth Elements (REE) sources encourage looking for easily available sources located in Europe. REE in evolved magmatic systems are predominantly associated with alkali environments. Therefore, it was decided to identify the content of REE in alkali igneous rocks of the Winna Góra basalt quarry located in Lower Silesia, Poland. In this study, a commercially available basalt aggregate from Winna Góra deposit located in the south-western part of Poland near Jawornik was examined for REE content. Mineral content and chemical composition were examined with a light microscope, XRD and XRF, whereas trace element content was measured with the ICP-MS technique. A new method of sample preparation for the purpose of REE identification in basalt aggregate based on pressure microwave mineralisation was developed. Mineral composition and TAS diagram classify aggregate as tephrite. The mineral composition of samples reflects typical mafic and ultramafic rocks. Quantitative mineralogical analysis by the Rietveld method showed that the main minerals are anorthite (46.7%) and augite (37.4%) with a minor content of forsterite (7.5%), nepheline (7.4%) and apatite below 1%. The total content of REE does not exceed 132 ppm. Chondrite normalised curves show the highest concentration of La and Pr. In the case of HREE, the majority of elements (Eu, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb) concentrations were below 1 ppm, a Tm and Lu were not detected. The low enrichment in HREE was also reflected in La/Gd ratios. Obtained results are comparable to the REE contents in the western part of the Cenozoic European Volcanic Province.",

    "abstract": "The anthropic interventions on riverbeds and banks have a direct and irreversible influence on the flow regime, primarily by changing the hydraulic characteristics of rivers, like channel slope and/or geometry, channel roughness, flow depth, consequently water velocity, propagation time of floods, etc. In the Upper Basin of the Crişul Negru River, the first hydro-technical arrangements were made in the 18th and 19th centuries, mainly for flood mitigation and swampy areas amelioration. But the most important and extensive works were designed following the exceptional floods of 1980-1981 (consolidations of banks, embankments, regularizations, bottom sills, etc.) and at the end of the 20th century. The purpose of the paper is to emphasize the effects of the hydro-technical works on both the morphology of the riverbed and the flow regime (average, minimum and maximum flow) of the most affected rivers in the study area. The data utilized are elevation profiles, stages and discharges recorded on more than 40 years at four gauging stations, namely including periods before and after the execution of the extensive works. The positive and negative influences of the arrangements are highlighted through statistical analysis and trend detection in data series, corroborated with the commissioning of the hydro-technical works and the evolution of rivers' morphology.",
