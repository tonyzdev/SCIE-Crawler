These ligands are likely to surpass in popularity well-known phosphorus-based ligands because of their remarkable ability to establish strong bonds with the metal center and their capacity to permit significant doping of catalyst activity in a wide range of chemical transformations such as olefin metathesis, carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen cross-coupling reactions, hydrogenation, and hydrosilylation.",
