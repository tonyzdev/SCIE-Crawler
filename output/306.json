    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune/inflammatory disease affecting 0.5 to 1% of adults worldwide and frequently leads to joint destruction and disability. Early diagnosis and early and effective therapy may prevent joint damage and lead to better long-term results. Therefore, reliable biomarkers and outcome measures are needed. Refinement of the understanding of molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis have been achieved by combining knowledge on RA-associated genes, environmental factors and the presence of serological elements. The presence of autoantibodies is a distinctive feature of RA. Rheumatoid Factor and Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies are the two most remarkable autoantibodies in RA and provide different clinical and pathophysiological information. They precede the onset of disease symptoms and predict a more severe disease course, indicating a pathogenetic role in RA. Therefore, they promote a more accurate prognosis and contribute for a better disease management. Several RA-associated autoantibody systems have been identified: Anti-Carbamylated Antibodies, Anti-BRAF, Anti-Acetylated, Anti-PAD4 antibodies and others. Hopefully, the characterization of a comprehensive array of novel autoantibody systems in RA will provide unique pathogenic insights of relevance for the development of diagnostic and prognostic approaches compatible with an effective personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Benzbromarone is a uricosuric drug that has been used in the treatment of gout over the last 30 years. Due to its potent inhibition of the dominant apical (luminal) urate exchanger in the human proximal tubule URAT1, it reduces the urate reabsorption, diminishing serum urate levels and therefore preventing gout flares. Through several clinical trials, Benzbromarone has been proved effective and safe, inclusive in patients with chronic kidney disease and as combination therapy with allopurinol. Due to hepatotoxicity reports, it was withdrawn from the European market by the manufacturer, however many authors have questioned the product’s withdrawal due to a lack of clinical evidence in order to support its hepatotoxicity. Benzbromarone is still available in several European countries, New Zealand, Brazil and several other countries. Despite the product’s marketing over more than 20 years after the first hepatotoxicity reports, we have found only five reports in our literature search, and no prospective or retrospective study correlating hepatotoxicity with benzbromarone use. Benzbromarone is a safe and effective molecule for the treatment of gout. However, due to in vitro and in vivo data related to hepatotoxicity, it is prudent to prescribe it with some caution, especially for patients with an already known liver condition.",

In this review, we addressed a theoretical model on immunopathogenesis associated with severe COVID-19, based on the current literature of SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemic pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS. Several studies have suggested that immune dysregulation and hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 are more involved in disease severity than the virus itself. Immune dysregulation due to COVID-19 is characterized by delayed and impaired interferon response, lymphocyte exhaustion and cytokine storm that ultimately lead to diffuse lung tissue damage and posterior thrombotic phenomena. Considering there is a lack of clinical evidence provided by randomized clinical trials, the knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 disease pathogenesis and immune response is a cornerstone to develop rationale-based clinical therapeutic strategies. In this narrative review, the authors aimed to describe the immunopathogenesis of severe forms of COVID-19.",

One type of treatment is strength training (ST). However, there is a need for more information on optimal training protocols, intensity, and volume needed to improve symptoms. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of ST in the treatment of FM through a systematic review of experimental research. Medical Subject Headings search terms and electronic databases including Scientific Electronic Library Online, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database were used to identify studies. The inclusion criteria were met by 22 eligible studies. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (36%), Finland (23%), Brazil (18%), and Sweden (18%). The studies showed that ST reduces the number of tender points, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, and improves sleep quality and quality of life in patients with FM. The intervention period ranged from 3 to 21 weeks, with sessions performed 2 times a week in 81.81% of the studies, at initial intensities of 40% of 1-repetition maximum. The repetitions ranged from 4 to 20, with no specific protocol defined for ST in FM. The main results included reduction in pain, fatigue, number of tender points, depression, and anxiety, with increased functional capacity and quality of life. Current evidence demonstrates that ST is beneficial and can be used to treat FM. CRD42016048480.",

This study aims to compare the performance among the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria (SLICC) and the new European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR criteria, in a cSLE cohort. We conducted a medical chart review study of cSLE cases and controls with defined rheumatic diseases, both ANA positive, to establish each ACR1997, SLICC and EULAR/ACR criterion fulfilled, at first visit and 1-year-follow-up. Study population included 122 cSLE cases and 89 controls. At first visit, SLICC criteria had higher sensitivity than ACR 1997 (89.3% versus 70.5%, p < 0.001), but similar specificity (80.9% versus 83.2%, p = 0.791), however performance was not statistically different at 1-year-follow-up. SLICC better scored in specificity compared to EULAR/ACR score ≥ 10 at first visit (80.9% versus 67.4%, p = 0.008) and at 1-year (76.4% versus 58.4%, p = 0.001), although sensitivities were similar. EULAR/ACR criteria score ≥ 10 exhibited higher sensitivity than ACR 1997 (87.7% versus 70.5%, p < 0.001) at first visit, but comparable at 1-year, whereas specificity was lower at first visit (67.4% versus 83.2%, p = 0.004) and 1-year (58.4% versus 76.4%, p = 0.002). A EULAR/ACR score ≥ 13 against a score ≥ 10, resulted in higher specificity, positive predictive value, and cut-off point accuracy. Compared to SLICC, a EULAR/ACR score ≥ 13 resulted in lower sensitivity at first visit (76.2% versus 89.3%, p < 0.001) and 1-year (91% versus 97.5%, p = 0.008), but similar specificities at both assessments. When compared to ACR 1997, a EULAR/ACR total score ≥ 13, resulted in no differences in sensitivity and specificity at both observation periods. In this cSLE population, SLICC criteria better scored at first visit and 1-year-follow-up. The adoption of a EULAR/ACR total score ≥ 13 in this study, against the initially proposed ≥10 score, was most appropriate to classify cSLE. Further studies are necessary to address if SLICC criteria might allow fulfillment of cSLE classification earlier in disease course and may be more inclusive of cSLE subjects for clinical studies.",

Methods International multicenter prospective survey including patients in 18 centers in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico with diagnosis of RA and aged between 21-55 years. The following standard questionnaires were completed at baseline and throughout a 1-year follow-up: WPAI:RA, WALS, WLQ-25, EQ-5D-3 L and SF-36. Clinical and demographic variables were also collected through interview. Results The study enrolled 290 patients on baseline visit. Overall mean scores at baseline visit were: WPAI:RA (presenteeism) = 29.5% (SD = 28.8%); WPAI:RA (absenteeism) = 9.0% (SD = 23.2%); WPAI:RA (absenteeism and presenteeism) = 8.6% (SD = 22.6%); WALS = 9.0 (SD = 6.1); WLQ-25 = 7.0% (SD = 5.1%); SF-36 Physical Scale = 39.1 (SD = 10.3) and Mental Scale = 45.4 (SD = 11.3); EQ-5D-3 L VAS = 69.8 (SD = 20.4) and EQ-5D-3 L index = 0.67 (SD = 0.23). Higher educational levels were associated with better results in WLQ-25, while previous orthopedic surgeries reduced absenteeism results of WPAI:RA and work limitations in WLQ-25. Higher disease duration was associated with decreased HRQoL. Intensification of disease activity was associated with decreased work productivity and HRQoL, except in WLQ-25. In the longitudinal analysis, worsening in disease activity was associated with a decrease in both work productivity and HRQoL. Conclusions RA patients are dealing with workplace disabilities and limitations and loss in HRQoL, and multiple factors seems to be associated with this. Worsening of disease activity further decreased work productivity and HRQoL, stressing the importance of disease tight control.",

In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been recommended for pain relief in various chronic pain disorders. The objective of the present research was to study the effect of low frequency rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on pain status in FMS. Methods Ninety diagnosed cases of FMS were randomized into Sham-rTMS and Real-rTMS groups. Real rTMS (1 Hz/1200 pulses/8 trains/90% resting motor threshold) was delivered over the right DLPFC for 5 consecutive days/week for 4 weeks. Pain was assessed by subjective and objective methods along with oxidative stress markers. Patients were followed up for 6 months (post-rTMS;15 days, 3 months and 6 months). Results In Real-rTMS group, average pain ratings and associated symptoms showed significant improvement post rTMS. The beneficial effects of rTMS lasted up to 6 months in the follow-up phase. In Sham-rTMS group, no significant change in pain ratings was observed. Conclusion Right DLPFC rTMS can significantly reduce pain and associated symptoms of FMS probably through targeting spinal pain circuits and top-down pain modulation .

    "abstract": "High-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) has been increasingly employed in daily rheumatological practice and in clinical research. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), MSUS can be now considered a complement to physical examination. This method evaluates synovitis through gray-scale and power Doppler and it is also able to identify bone erosions. The utilization of MSUS as a marker of RA activity has received attention in recent literature. Current data account for good correlation of MSUS with classical measures of clinical activity; in some instances, MSUS appears to perform even better. Diagnosis of subclinical synovitis by MSUS might help the physician in RA management. With some variation, interobserver MSUS agreement seems excellent for erosion and good for synovitis. However, lack of MSUS score standardization is still an unmet need. In this review, we describe several MSUS scores, as well as their correlation with clinical RA activity and response to therapy. Finally, we look at the relationship of MSUS with synovial tissue inflammation and discuss future perspectives for a better interpretation and integration of this imaging method into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prolotherapy with hypertonic dextrose in patients with knee osteoarthritis. A systematic search was performed in electronic databases including PUBMED, SCIELO, DIALNET and Google Scholar. We searched for randomized clinical trials that evaluated therapeutic interventions in patients with knee osteoarthritis. These trials compared the effect of intra-articular and / or extra-articular infiltrations of hypertonic dextrose vs the effect of intra-articular and / or extra-articular infiltrations of other substances or some interventional procedure application, via assessing pain, physical function and secondary effects and / or adverse reactions. Ten randomized clinical trials were included in this systematic review, the total sample size comprised 328 patients treated with hypertonic dextrose (prolotherapy) vs 348 controls treated with other infiltrations such as local anesthetics, hyaluronic acid, ozone, platelet-rich plasma or interventional procedures like radiofrequency. In terms of pain reduction and function improvement, prolotherapy with hypertonic dextrose was more effective than infiltrations with local anesthetics, as effective as infiltrations with hyaluronic acid, ozone or radiofrequency and less effective than PRP and erythropoietin, with beneficial effect in the short, medium and long term. In addition, no side effects or serious adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with hypertonic dextrose. Although HDP seems to be a promising interventional treatment for knee OA, more studies with better methodological quality and low risk of bias are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the NLR and PLR as potential markers of disease activity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Methods The study involved 132 patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 81 healthy controls matched in terms of age and gender. Their sociodemographic data, disease activity scores using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts were recorded. The patients with ankylosing spondylitis were further divided according to their BASDAI scores into patients with inactive disease (BASDAI &lt; 4) and patients with active disease (BASDAI ≥4). The correlations between the NLR, PLR and disease activity were analysed. Results There was a statistically significant difference in the NLR and PLR between the active and inactive ankylosing spondylitis patients (2.31 ± 1.23 vs. 1.77 ± 0.73, p = 0.002), (142.04 ± 70.98 vs. 119.24 ± 32.49, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in both the NLR and PLR between the healthy control group and ankylosing spondylitis patients ( p &gt; 0.05). In addition, the PLR was significantly higher in both the active and inactive groups compared to those in the healthy control group (142.04 ± 70.98 vs. 99.32 ± 33.97, p = 0.014), (119.24 ± 32.49 vs. 99.32 ± 33.97, p = 0.019). The BASDAI scores were positively correlated with the PLR (r = 0.219, p = 0.012) and the NLR, but they were not statistically significant with the later (r = 0.170, p = 0.051). Based on the ROC curve, the best NLR cut-off value for predicting severe disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis patients was 1.66, with a sensitivity of 61.8% and a specificity of 50.6%, whereas the best PLR cut-off value was 95.9, with a sensitivity of 70.9% and a specificity of 55.5%. Conclusion The PLR may be used as a useful marker in the assessment and monitoring of disease activity in AS together with acute phase reactants such as the ESR.",

Although there are no well-designed studies that prove the effectiveness of the mat Pilates method in this population. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the mat Pilates method for improving symptoms in women with fibromyalgia. Methods A single blind randomized controlled trial in which 42 women with fibromyalgia were randomized into two groups: mat Pilates and aquatic aerobic exercise. The exercises were performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Two evaluations were performed: one at baseline (T0), and another at 12 weeks after randomization (T12). The primary outcome was pain measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), quality of life (Short Form 36 [SF-36]), fear avoidance (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire [FABQ-BR]) and pain catastrophizing (Pain-Related Catastrophizing Thoughts Scale [PRCTS]). Results There was improvement in both groups in relation to pain and function ( p &lt; 0.05). The aspects related to quality of life and the FABQ questionnaire only showed improvement in the mat Pilates group ( p &lt; 0.05).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate active inflammatory sacroiliitis related to axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The qualitative and semiquantitative diagnosis performed by expert radiologists and rheumatologists remains subject to significant intrapersonal and interpersonal variation. This encouraged us to use machine-learning methods for this task. Methods In this retrospective study including 56 sacroiliac joint MRI exams, 24 patients had positive and 32 had negative findings for inflammatory sacroiliitis according to the ASAS group criteria. The dataset was randomly split with ~ 80% (46 samples, 20 positive and 26 negative) as training and ~ 20% as external test (10 samples, 4 positive and 6 negative). After manual segmentation of the images by a musculoskeletal radiologist, multiple features were extracted. The classifiers used were the Support Vector Machine, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and the Instance-Based Algorithm, combined with the Relief and Wrapper methods for feature selection. Results Based on 10-fold cross-validation using the training dataset, the MLP classifier obtained the best performance with sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 95.6% and accuracy = 84.7%, using 6 features selected by the Wrapper method. Using the test dataset (external validation) the same MLP classifier obtained sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 66.7% and accuracy = 80%. Conclusions Our results show the potential of machine learning methods to identify SIJ subchondral bone marrow edema in axSpA patients and are promising to aid in the detection of active inflammatory sacroiliitis on MRI STIR sequences. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the best results.",

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic centralized pain sensitivity disorder. Psychological, physical and/or autoimmune stressors were found to increase FM symptoms. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 fear and anxiety level, and to examine their effect on disease severity, sleep quality, and mood in FM patients compared to control group.This pilot study conducted as a cross-sectional study, and included 62 participants. Participants were divided into two groups: FM patient group (n = 31) and control group (n = 31). Symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood were determined using the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), Pitsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. In order to evaluate the level of COVID-19 fear and anxiety, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) were used compared to control group.FIQR, PSQI, HAD-A, HAD-D, FCV-19S and CAS scores were significantly higher in the FM group (p = 0.01). A positive significant correlation was found between FCV-19S and CAS results and FIQR, PSQI, and HAD-anx results in FM patients (p < 0.05).This pilot study showed that, the individuals with FM can be more affected by psychological stress, and this situation negatively affects the symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood in FM patients, so these patients should be closely monitored in terms of psychological stressors and their effects during pandemics. More studies with more participants are necessary to describe the challenges lived by fibromyalgia population.",

However, the exact mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates RA remains unclear. Methods Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blot assays were performed to explore the expressions of SIRT1 and Yin Yang 1 (YY1). CCK-8 assay was used for cytoactive detection. The interaction between SIRT1 and YY1 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). DCFH-DA assay and iron assay were applied to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron ion levels. Results In the serum of RA patients, SIRT1 was downregulated, but YY1 was upregulated. In LPS-induced synoviocytes, SIRT1 could increase cell viability and decrease ROS and iron levels. Mechanistically, YY1 downregulated the expression of SIRT1 by inhibiting its transcription. YY1 overexpression partly revised the effects of SIRT1 on ferroptosis in synoviocytes. Conclusion SIRT1 is transcriptionally repressed by YY1 and inhibits the ferroptosis of synoviocytes induced by LPS, so as to relieve the pathological process of RA. Therefore, SIRT1 might be a new diagnosis and therapeutic target of RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Relapsing polychondritis is a rare multisystem disease involving cartilaginous and proteoglycan-rich structures. The diagnosis of this disease is mainly suggested by the presence of flares of inflammation of the cartilage, particularly in the ears, nose or respiratory tract, and more rarely, in the presence of other manifestations. The spectrum of clinical presentations may vary from intermittent episodes of painful and often disfiguring auricular and nasal chondritis to an occasional organ or even life-threatening manifestations such as lower airway collapse. There is a lack of awareness about this disease is mainly due to its rarity. In 2020, VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome, a novel autoinflammatory syndrome, was described. VEXAS syndrome is attributed to somatic mutations in methionine-41 of UBA1 , the major E1 enzyme that initiates ubiquitylation. This new disease entity connects seemingly unrelated conditions: systemic inflammatory syndromes (relapsing chondritis, Sweet’s syndrome, and neutrophilic dermatosis) and hematologic disorders (myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma). Therefore, this article reviews the current literature on both disease entities.",

Methods In this, 34 patients with KOA and 30 age and sex-matched healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled. Patients were categorized based on their Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Body Mass Index (BMI) scores. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was employed to measure serum levels of IL-17 A and IL-25. Results Level of IL-25 was significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.0001) in the KOA subjects than HS. IL-17 A level was significantly higher in KOA cases with WOMAC &lt; 40 ( P &lt; 0.0001) in comparison to HS.

KOA patients with BMI ≥ 30 had significantly higher IL-17 A and IL-25 concentration in comparison to HS. Conclusions The serum level of IL-25 in KOA patients is increased probably due to negative controlling feedback on inflammatory responses, which can be associated with obesity and disease activity.",

Materials and methods Leveraging GWAS summary data of inflammatory cytokines and SS, we executed the first two-sample MR analysis. Genetic variants from prior GWASs associated with circulating inflammatory cytokines served as instrumental variables (IVs). Data regarding cytokines were analyzed using the Olink Target-96 Inflammation panel, synthesizing data from 14,824 participants. GWAS summary statistics for SS were procured from the UK Biobank, focusing on samples of European ancestry. To discern the causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and SS, several MR methodologies, including inverse variance weighted (IVW) and MR-Egger regression, were applied. Results After rigorous IV quality control, 91 cytokines were incorporated into the MR analysis. The IVW analysis identified 8 cytokines with a positive association to SS: Axin-1 (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.07–6.10), T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5 (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.08–3.02), CUDP1 (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.00-2.58), CXCL10 (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.25–2.95), IL-4 (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.22–3.91), IL-7 (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.27–4.33), MCP-2 (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05–1.54), and TNFRSF9 (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.03–3.24), suggesting their potential in increasing SS risk. Conclusion Our study conducted through MR, identified various inflammatory cytokines associated with SS risk, validating some previous research results and offering some new potential biomarkers for SS. However, these findings necessitate further research for validation and exploration of their precise role in the onset and progression of SS.",

In the last decade, several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate new treatment options for SSc. The purpose of this work is to update the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology in light of the new evidence available for the pharmacological management of SSc. Methods A systematic review including randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for predefined questions that were elaborated according to the Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) strategy was conducted. The rating of the available evidence was performed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. To become a recommendation, at least 75% agreement of the voting panel was needed. Results Six recommendations were elaborated regarding the pharmacological treatment of Raynaud’s phenomenon, the treatment (healing) and prevention of digital ulcers, skin involvement, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and gastrointestinal involvement in SSc patients based on results available from RCTs. New drugs, such as rituximab, were included as therapeutic options for skin involvement, and rituximab, tocilizumab and nintedanib were included as therapeutic options for ILD. Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of scleroderma renal crisis and musculoskeletal involvement were elaborated based on the expert opinion of the voting panel, as no placebo-controlled RCTs were found. Conclusion These guidelines updated and incorporated new treatment options for the management of SSc based on evidence from the literature and expert opinion regarding SSc, providing support for decision-making in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown origin, which consists of the formation of multiple sterile noncaseating granulomas. Inhaled antigens are believed to initiate disease in prone individuals, considering that almost all patients present pulmonary or mediastinal lymph node disease. Extrapulmonary manifestations are common and diverse: practically any organ system can be affected, and treatment can range from simple watchful waiting to intense immunosuppression. In this article, we review current concepts about sarcoidosis in an overview, focusing on recognition and treatment of its major clinical phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To compare the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical status and psychological distress of patients with immune-mediated rheumatic disease (IMRD) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of noninfected IMRD controls during a 6-month follow-up period. Methods The ReumaCoV Brazil is a longitudinal study designed to follow IMRD patients for 6 months after COVID-19 (patients) compared with IMRD patients without COVID-19 (controls). Clinical data, disease activity measurements and current treatments regarding IMRD and COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated in all patients. Disease activity was assessed through validated tools at inclusion and at 3 and 6 months post-COVID-19. Fatigue, using FACIT-F (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy) and psychological distress, using DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale − 21 Items), used to evaluated psychological distress, were evaluated at 6 months after COVID-19 in both groups. The significance level was set as p &lt; 0.05, with a 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 601 patients were evaluated—321 patients (IMRD COVID-19 + patients) and 280 controls (IMRD COVID-19- patients)—who were predominantly female with similar median ages. Disease activity assessment over a 6-month follow-up showed no significant difference between cases and controls. Although the mean activity scores did not differ significantly, some patients reported worsened disease activity post-COVID-19, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (32.2%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (23.3%). Post-COVID-19 worsening in RA patients correlated with medical global assessment (MGA) and CDAI scores, with a moderate to large effect size. Diabetes mellitus showed a positive association (OR = 7.15), while TNF inhibitors had a protective effect (OR = 0.51). Fatigue, depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly greater in patients than in controls. Worse disease activity post-COVID-19 correlated with worse FACIT-F and DASS-21 scores in RA patients. No significant associations were found between COVID-19 outcomes and post-COVID-19 disease activity, FACIT-F or DASS-21. Conclusions Post-COVID-19 IMRD patients exhibited significant fatigue, depression, anxiety, and stress, which can be mistaken for disease activity, despite having similar disease activity scores. The variability in reports on IMRD flares and the potential triggering of SARS-CoV-2 for autoimmune manifestations underscore the need for detailed clinical assessment and a comprehensive approach to managing them.",

Health education programs (HEP) have emerged as good non-pharmacological strategies to treat it. However, it is still not clear if the benefits are only subjective, or it has also objective impacts on immune and or neuroendocrine systems. Fifty-eight fibromyalgia women were randomly allocated in experimental group (n = 27) or control group (n = 31). The experimental group was submitted to HEP treatment for 11 weeks, while control group did not receive intervention at the same period. All data were collected at zero and 11th week by a blinded researcher. The statistical analysis were made in GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0) with significant level adjusted for α = 0.05. Forty-four patients concluded the full study, 21 in the experimental group and 23 in the control group. Intragroup and intergroup analysis revealed that treatment induced significant increases of IL-4 plasma levels, anti-inflammatory cytokine/inflammatory cytokine ratio (AC/IC ratio), salivary cortisol levels, in addition to significant decreases on FIQ scores. Intergroup variation analyses revealed also significant increases of IL-10 plasma levels. The results presented suggest that this kind of HEP could induce subjective and objective changes (immune and neuroendocrine), that could explain, at least in part the improvement of fibromyalgia patient's health status.

The RAG was assessed for disease activity by the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28); for functional capacity by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the Cochin Hand Functional Scale (CHFS) questionnaire, and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire; and for HS and pinch strength (2-point tip-to-tip, lateral or key, and 3-point) using Jamar® and pinch gauge dynamometers, respectively. Associations were analyzed by Pearson and Spearman tests, and groups were compared by the independent samples t test, with a significance level of P < 0.05.The convenience sample included 121 rheumatoid patients and a control group matched by age, sex, and body mass index. The RAG showed lower strength values compared with the CG in all measurements (P < 0.01, 95% CI) and these values were associated with worse performance in the functional questionnaires and greater disease activity and duration. There was a strong correlation among the functional assessment instruments.The decrease in grip and pinch strength, easily measured by portable dynamometers, is a strong indicator of functional disability in RA patients.",

Four general principles and eleven recommendations were approved. General principles: RA treatment should (1) preferably consist of a multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a rheumatologist, (2) include counseling on lifestyle habits, strict control of comorbidities, and updates of the vaccination record, (3) be based on decisions shared by the patient and the physician after clarification about the disease and the available therapeutic options; (4) the goal is sustained clinical remission or, when this is not feasible, low disease activity. Recommendations: (1) the first line of treatment should be a csDMARD, started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is established; (2) methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice csDMARD; (3) the combination of two or more csDMARDs, including MTX, may be used as the first line of treatment; (4) after failure of first-line therapy with MTX, the therapeutic strategies include combining MTX with another csDMARD (leflunomide), with two csDMARDs (hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine), or switching MTX for another csDMARD (leflunomide or sulfasalazine) alone; (5) after failure of two schemes with csDMARDs, a bDMARD may be preferably used or, alternatively a tsDMARD, preferably combined, in both cases, with a csDMARD; (6) the different bDMARDs in combination with MTX have similar efficacy, and therefore, the therapeutic choice should take into account the peculiarities of each drug in terms of safety and cost; (7) the combination of a bDMARD and MTX is preferred over the use of a bDMARD alone; (8) in case of failure of an initial treatment scheme with a bDMARD, a scheme with another bDMARD can be used; in cases of failure with a TNFi, a second bDMARD of the same class or with another mechanism of action is effective and safe; (9) tofacitinib can be used to treat RA after failure of bDMARD; (10) corticosteroids, preferably at low doses for the shortest possible time, should be considered during periods of disease activity, and the risk-benefit ratio should also be considered; (11) reducing or spacing out bDMARD doses is possible in patients in sustained remission.",

    "abstract": "Interpretation of rituximab efficacy for refractory idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) is hampered by the absence of a uniform definition of refractory myositis and clinical response. Therefore, rigorous criteria of refractoriness, together with a homogenous definition of clinical improvement, were used to evaluate rituximab one-year response. A retrospective cohort study including 43 IIM (15 antisynthetase syndrome, 16 dermatomyositis, 12 polymyositis) was conducted. All patients had refractory disease (inadequate response to at least two immunosuppressives/immunomodulatories and no less than three months sequentially or concomitantly glucocorticoid tapering) criteria. Clinical/laboratory improvement at one-year was based on modified International Myositis Assessment & Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) core set measures. The patients received two infusions of rituximab (1 g each) at baseline, followed by repeated dose after 6 months. Baseline immunosuppressive therapy was maintained and glucocorticoid dose was tapered according to clinical/laboratory parameters. Five patients had side effects at the first rituximab application and were excluded. Therefore, 38 out of 43 patients completed the one-year follow up. Almost 75% of the patients attained clinical and laboratory response after one-year. A significant reduction in median glucocorticoid dose (18.8 vs. 6.3 mg/day) was achieved and 42% patients were able to discontinue prednisone. In contrast, young individuals and patients with dysphagia had a tendency to be non-responders to rituximab. No severe infections were observed. This study provides convincing evidence that rituximab is an effective and safe therapy for refractory IIM.",

The volunteers walked on a 10-m platform at their usual gait speed, using 2 pressure sensors positioned at the base of the hallux and calcaneus. The mean step time, support and double support times, swing time and gait speed were calculated. The evaluation of the quadriceps isometric torque was performed in an extensor chair, with hip and knee flexion at 90°. The procedure consisted of three maximal contractions of knee extension. Peak torque was determined by the highest torque value obtained after the onset of muscle contraction. For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation were used, with p < 0.05. The KOAG had a 54.76% longer support time, a 13% longer step time (p < 0.001), a 30% decrease in swing time (p < 0.001) and a 10.7% decrease in gait speed (p = 0.001) compared with controls. The quadriceps isometric torque was 34% (p = 0.001) lower in the KOAG. There was a correlation between kinematic variables and quadriceps torque. Weakness of the quadriceps muscle in women with KOA influences gait pattern, resulting in reduced speed associated with a shorter swing time and longer support time.",

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess the presence of depression with a cut-off of 11. We collected data about disease activity and disability with DAS28, TJC-68, PhGA, PGA, VAS, DAS28, SDAI, CDAI and HAQ.Prevalence of depression was 14.3% (95% CI: 11-17%). Depressed patients, when compared with not depressed ones, were found to have higher scores for TJC-68 (p = 0.011), PhGA (p = 0.001), PGA (p = 0.001), VAS (p = 0.001), DAS28 (p = 0.007), SDAI (p = 0.001), CDAI (p = 0.001) and HAQ (p = 0.001). Out of the 70 depressed patients, 30 subjects, already known to be depressed in the past, were still depressed at the time of the assessment, with only 11 (15.7%) under antidepressants. A multivariate analysis showed that male sex, higher PGA score, use of antidepressants and higher HAQ score were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression.Our study shows that depression is common in RA and may affect its activity mainly via an alteration in the perception of the disease. Although its important implications, depression is still under-diagnosed and its management is inadequate.",

Mendelian randomization is an analytical method that uses genetic data as tool variables to evaluate the causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Objective To review the systematic reviews and Mendelian randomization studies that focused on the risk factors of systemic lupus erythematosus and shed light on the development of treatments for its prevention and intervention. Methods From inception to January 2022, we systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase for related systematic reviews and Mendelian randomization studies. Extract relevant main data for studies that meet inclusion criteria. The quality of systematic reviews was assessed by using Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2). Finally, the risk factors are scored comprehensively according to the results’ quantity, quality, and consistency. Results Our study involved 64 systematic reviews and 12 Mendelian randomization studies. The results of systematic reviews showed that diseases (endometriosis, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis), lifestyle (smoking, drinking, vaccination), and gene polymorphism influenced the incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. The results of Mendelian randomization studies identified the role of disease (periodontitis, celiac disease), trace elements (selenium, iron), cytokines (growth differentiation factor 15), and gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Conclusion We should pay attention to preventing and treating systemic lupus erythematosus in patients with endometriosis, celiac disease, and periodontitis. Take appropriate dietary supplements to increase serum iron and selenium levels to reduce the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus. There should be no excessive intervention in lifestyles such as smoking and drinking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease, which might trigger cartilage, bone damage, and disability. Recent studies have suggested that Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an alkaloid monomer isolated from the rhizome of the traditional herbal medicine Ligusticum wallichii Franch, exerts a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, containing anti-inflammatory. This study aimed to analyze the role and underlying mechanism of TMP in RA. Methods Under Hypoxia condition, RA-Fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) were treated with TMP at different doses. Cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression, and migration were detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. Cyclin D1, Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), MMP9, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein levels were measured using western blot assay. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were evaluated using ELISA. Circular RNA (circRNA) hsa_circ_0005178 (circCDC42BPB), CDC42BPB, and HIF-1α expression were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Binding between HIF-1α and CDC42BPB promoter was predicted by JASPAR and verified using dual-luciferase reporter and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Results TMP might hinder FLS proliferation, cycle progression, migration, and inflammatory response under hypoxic conditions. CircCDC42BPB expression was increased in RA patients and RA-FLSs treated with hypoxia, while its level was obviously reduced in RA-FLSs treated with hypoxia and TMP. TMP might abolish hypoxia-induced circCDC42BPB expression. Upregulation of circCDC42BPB might partially overturn the repression of TMP on hypoxia-caused RA-FLS damage. TMP might regulate circCDC42BPB level via HIF-1α in RA-FLSs under hypoxic conditions. Conclusion TMP might block RA-FLS injury partly via regulating the HIF-1α- circCDC42BPB pathway, providing a promising therapeutic target for RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Osteoarthritis (OA) affects the entire joint, causing structural changes in articular cartilage, subchondral bone, ligaments, capsule, synovial membrane, and periarticular muscles that afflicts millions of people globally, leading to persistent pain and diminished quality of life. The intra-articular use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is gaining recognition as a secure therapeutic approach due to its potential regenerative capabilities. However, there is controversial clinical data regarding efficacy of PRP for OA treatment. In this context, gathering scientific evidence on the effects of PRP in treating OA in animal models could provide valuable insights into understanding its impact on aspects like cartilage health, synovial tissue integrity, and the inflammatory process in affected joints. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of PRP injections on inflammation and histopathological aspects of cartilage and synovium in animal models of OA through a comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods A electronic search was conducted on Medline, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, LILACS, and SciELO databases for relevant articles published until June 2022. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to synthesize evidence on the histological characteristics of cartilage and synovium, as well as the inflammatory process. The GRADE approach was utilized to categorize the quality of evidence, and methodological quality was assessed using SYRCLE’s RoB tool. Results Twenty-one studies were included in the review, with twelve of them incorporated into the meta-analysis. PRP treatment demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the control group in terms of cartilage histology (very low quality; p = 0.0002), synovium histology (very low quality; p &lt; 0.0001), and reductions in proinflammatory markers, including IL-1 (low quality; p = 0.002), IL-6 (very low quality; p &lt; 0.00001), and TNF-α (very low; p &lt; 0.00001). However, PRP treatment did not yield a significant impact on PDGF-A levels (very low quality; p = 0.81). Conclusion PRP appears capable of reducing proinflammatory markers (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and mitigating cartilage and synovium damage in animals with OA. However, the levels of evidence of these findings are low to very low. Therefore, more rigorous studies with larger samples are needed to improve the quality of evidence.

    "abstract": "To assess the main fears and beliefs of people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their effect on treatment outcomes; METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in Pubmed/Medline; original articles published up to May 2017, reporting fears and/or beliefs of adult patients with RA were analyzed. Fears and beliefs were collected by two independent researchers and grouped into categories.Among 474 references identified, 84 were analyzed, corresponding to 24,336 RA patients. Fears were reported in 38.4% of the articles (N = 32/84): most studies described fears related to pharmacological therapy (50.0%, N = 16/32) and fear of disability (28.1%, N = 9/32). Beliefs were reported in 88.0% of articles (N = 74/84) and were found to moderate the patient-perceived impact of RA in 44.6% (N = 33/74), mainly the emotional impact (18.9%, N = 14/74); measures of function, quality of life, fatigue and pain were also found to be affected by patients' beliefs in 8.1% (N = 6/74), 6.8% (N = 5/74), 2.7% (N = 2/74) and 2.7% (N = 2/74) of the articles, respectively. Beliefs about therapy were linked to adherence in 17.6% of articles (N = 13/74) and beliefs about cause of RA predicted coping patterns in 12.2% of publications (N = 9/74). Only 9.5% (N = 8/84) of articles reported fears and/or beliefs of patients living outside Europe and North America: there was only one work which recruited patients in Latin America and no article included patients from Africa.In RA, patients' beliefs are linked to impact of disease and non-adherence. Further research is needed on fears/ beliefs of patients living outside Europe and North America.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Bone disease is common in patients undergoing hemodialysis. It is the result of bone turnover abnormalities and the decrease of bone mineral density (BMD). We aimed to determine the usefulness of serum bone turnover markers and BMD measurement by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in hemodialysis patients. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study including 90 hemodialysis for more than 12 months. Bone mineral density was assessed by DXA. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from each patient before dialysis in a fasting state within a week of the DXA. Biochemical variables of calcium and phosphate were measured. One bone formation marker (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP), one bone resorption marker (carboxy-terminal telopeptides of type 1 collagen (CTX)) were measured. Total alkaline phosphatase (TAP), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) which is a bone-derived hormone were also measured. Results CTX values were 6.25 times higher than the normal limit of the assay. Bone alkaline phosphatase levels were less than 10 ng/mL in 28.8% of cases. 23% of patients have osteoporosis and 45% have osteopenia. Femoral BMD had negative correlations with age and PTH levels. FGF23 levels were significantly increased in patients with osteoporosis affecting the lumbar. The levels of bAP and CTX showed a positive correlation. Both circulating bAP and CTX levels showed also positive correlations with PTH levels. Fractures, observed in 12.2% of cases, were associated with low PTH values and the existence of osteoporosis. Conclusions Our study showed that osteoporosis and fracture are common in dialysis patients. The reduced BMD was associated with advanced age and elevated levels of PTH. Markers of bone turnover and FGF23 may play a role in the diagnosis of bone disease in hemodialysis patients. DXA measurement is necessary for the monitoring for bone loss.",

This study aimed to evaluate clinical and laboratory risk factors associated with PAH in SLE patients.This was a retrospective case-control study in which patients with SLE with PAH (SLE-PAH) confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) were compared with SLE patients without PAH. Clinical and demographic variables related to SLE and PAH and nailfold capillaroscopy were evaluated by reviewing the medical records of the patients.Twenty-one patients with SLE-PAH and 44 patients with SLE without PAH matched for sex and disease duration were included. The scleroderma (SD) pattern on nailfold capillaroscopy was more frequently found in patients with SLE-PAH than in those without PAH (56.3% versus 15.9%, respectively, p = 0.002). By univariate analysis, Raynaud's phenomenon, history of abortion, and SD pattern on capillaroscopy were associated with PAH. Arthritis was a protective factor for PAH development. Multivariate analysis showed that the SD pattern on capillaroscopy was the only variable associated with a significantly higher risk of PAH, with an odds ratio of 6.393 (95% confidence interval, 1.530-26.716; p = 0.011).In this study, SD pattern was associated with a 6.3-fold increased risk for PAH development in SLE patients, suggesting that nailfold capillaroscopy might be useful as a screening method to identify SLE patients with a high risk of developing this severe complication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract İntroduction Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent fever and serosal inflammation. Anti-interleukin-1 (Anti-IL-1) treatments are recommended in colchicine resistant and/or intolerant FMF patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of anakinra and canakinumab in FMF patients that are resistant/intolareted to colchicine or complicated with amyloidosis. Methods Between January 2014 and March 2019, 65 patients following-up at Sivas Cumhuriyet University (Medical Faculty Rheumatology-Internal Medicine Department) who were diagnosed with FMF according to the criteria of Tel-Hashomer were included in the study. The laboratory values and clinical features of patients and disease activities were recorded at least every 3 months, and these data were analyzed. Results Forty-one (63.1%) patients used anakinra (100 mg/day) and 24 (36.9%) patients used canakinumab (150 mg/8 week). The median duration of anti-IL-1 agents use was 7 months (range, 3–30). Fifteen (23.1%) cases were complicated with amyloidosis. Seven (10.8%) patients had renal transplantation. Overall, the FMF 50 score response was 96.9%. In the group that had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 ml/min/m 2 , the median proteinuria decreased from 2390 mg/day (range, 1400–7200) to 890 mg/day (range, 120–2750) ( p = 0.008). No serious infections were detected, except in one patient. Conclusions Anti-IL-1 agents are effective and safe in the treatment of FMF patients. These agents are particularly effective at reducing proteinuria in patients with GFR ≥ 60 ml/min/m 2 , but less effective in cases with FMF associated with arthritis and sacroiliitis. Large and long follow-up studies are now needed to establish the long-term effects of these treatments.",

The objective of the present work was to compare the correlation of three enthesitis indices (MASES, SPARCC and LEI) with measures of disease activity and function in a heterogeneous population of patients with axial and peripheral SpA. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three Brazilian public university hospitals; patients fulfilling ASAS classification criteria for peripheral or axial SpA were recruited and measures of disease activity and function were collected and correlated to three enthesitis indices: MASES, SPARCC and LEI using Spearman's Correlation index. ROC curves were used to determine if the the enthesitis indices were useful to discriminate patients with active disease from those with inactive disease. Two hundred four patients were included, 71.1% (N = 145) fulfilled ASAS criteria for axial SpA and 28.9% (N = 59) for peripheral SpA. In axial SpA, MASES performed better than LEI (p = 0.018) and equal to SPARCC (p = 0.212) regarding correlation with disease activity (BASDAI) and function (BASFI). In peripheral SpA, only MASES had a weak but statistical significant correlation with DAS28-ESR (rs 0.310 p = 0.05) and MASES had better correlation with functional measures (HAQ) than SPARCC (p = 0.034). In this sample composed of SpA patients with high coexistence of axial and peripheral features, MASES showed statistical significant correlation with measures of disease activity and function in both axial and peripheral SpA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the past 20 years, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been investigated as treatment for systemic sclerosis (SSc). The goal of HSCT is to eradicate the autoreactive immune system, which is replaced by a new immune repertoire with long-lasting regulation and tolerance to autoantigens. Here, we describe the clinical outcomes of severe and refractory SSc patients that underwent HSCT at a single Brazilian center. Patients and methods This is a longitudinal and retrospective study, including 70 adult SSc patients, with an established diagnosis of SSc, and who underwent autologous HSCT from 2009 to 2016. The procedure included harvesting and cryopreservation of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells, followed by administration of an immunoablative regimen and subsequent infusion of the previously collected cells. Patients were evaluated immediately before transplantation, at 6 months and then yearly until at least 5-years of post-transplantation follow-up. At each evaluation time point, patients underwent clinical examination, including modified Rodnan’s skin score (mRSS) assessment, echocardiography, high-resolution computed tomography of the lungs and pulmonary function. Results Median (range) age was 35.9 (19–59), with 57 (81.4%) female and median (range) non-Raynaud’s disease duration of 2 (1–7) years. Before transplantation, 96% of the patients had diffuse skin involvement, 84.2%, interstitial lung disease and 67%, positive anti-topoisomerase I antibodies. Skin involvement significantly improved, with a decline in mRSS at all post-transplantation time points until at least 5-years of follow-up. When patients with pre-HSCT interstitial lung disease were analyzed, there was an improvement in pulmonary function (forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide) over the 5-year follow-up. Overall survival was 81% and progression-free survival was 70.5% at 8-years after HSCT. Three patients died due to transplant-related toxicity, 9 patients died over follow-up due to disease reactivation and one patient died due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Conclusions Autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation improves skin and interstitial lung involvement. These results are in line with the international experience and support HSCT as a viable therapeutic alternative for patients with severe and progressive systemic sclerosis.",

There is also scant information on the predictors of QoL in this population. The aim of this study was to assess QoL in patients with pSS and to investigate their possible predictors. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 77 patients with pSS were evaluated using the following questionnaires: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-Fatigue), EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF). Seventy-seven healthy controls responded to the SF-36 and WHOQOL-BREF. The Mann-Whitney test, t-test, Pearson and Spearman correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. Results Patients with pSS and healthy controls were matched by gender and age. The mean scores for the ESSDAI, ESSPRI and FACIT-Fatigue were 3.34 ± 4.61, 6.58 ± 2.29 and 26.17 ± 11.02, respectively. Patients had a lower employment rate (36.4% versus 62.3%, p &lt; 0.01) and higher work disability (10.4% versus 1.3%, p &lt; 0.01). SF-36 and WHOQOL-BREF values were lower in patients with pSS ( p &lt; 0.001), except in the WHOQOL-BREF environment domain. Pain (ESSPRI), fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Ro-SSA and economic class (Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria - CCEB) were independent predictors of QoL. Conclusions The main predictors of poor QoL in patients with pSS were pain and fatigue, and these symptoms had an impact regardless of disease activity, age, schooling, marital status, work disability and fibromyalgia.",

Methods This study was a single-blind, RCT conducted at Teaching Bay of Rehmatul-Lil-Alameen Post Graduate Institute of Cardiology between February and November 2020. 114 knee OA patients who were overweight and obese were randomly divided by a computer-generated number into the rehabilitation group with mHealth (RGw-mHealth) to receive LLRP + instructions of daily care (IDC) combined with mHealth intervention, rehabilitation group without mHealth (RGwo-mHealth) to receive LLRP + IDC intervention and control group (CG) to receive IDC intervention. All three groups were also provided leaflets explaining about their intervention. The primary outcome measure was knee pain measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. The secondary outcome measures were mobility measured by the Timed up and go (TUG) test, functional activity measured by the patient-specific functional scale (PSFS), and ADL measured by the Katz Index of independence in ADL scores. Results Among the 114 patients who were randomized (mean age, 53 years), 96 (84%) completed the trial. After 3-months of intervention, patients in all three groups had statistically significant knee pain reduction (RGw-mHealth: 2.54; RGwo-mHealth: 1.47; and CG: 0.37) within groups ( P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, patients in the RGw-mHealth and RGwo-mHealth had statistically significant improvement in mobility, functional activity, and ADL within groups ( P &lt; 0.05), but no improvement was noted in the CG ( p &gt; 0.05). As indicated in the overall analysis of covariance, there were statistically significant differences in the mean knee pain, mobility, functional activity, and ADL changes between groups after 3-months ( p &lt; 0.001). The pairwise between-group comparisons (Bonferroni post hoc analysis) of the knee pain, mobility, functional activity, and ADL scores at 3-months revealed that patients in the RGw-mHealth had significantly higher mean change in the knee pain, TUG test, functional activity, and ADL scores compared to patients in the RGwo-mHealth or CG. Conclusion Reduction in knee pain, improvement in mobility, functional activity, and ADL were more among patients in the RGw-mHealth compared with the RGwo-mHealth or CG.

There is cumulative evidence that cytokines play a crucial role in FM. It’s unknown whether clinical effects of WBC can be demonstrated at the molecular level and how long the effects last. Methods We compared effects of serial WBC (6 sessions (− 130 °C in 6 weeks) in FM patients and healthy controls (HC). Primary outcome was the change in pain level (visual analogue scale 0–100 mm) after 6 sessions. Secondary outcomes were a change in disease activity (revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire) and pain after 3 sessions and 3 months after discontinued therapy and in cytokine levels (interleukin (IL-)1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-10). The patients’ opinions on the satisfaction, effectiveness and significance of WBC were evaluated. Results Twenty-three FM patients and 30 HC were enrolled. WBC resulted in a significant reduction in pain and disease activity after 3 and 6 sessions. No clinical benefit could be measured 3 months after discontinued treatment. Overall, probands were satisfied with WBC and considered WBC to be important and effective. FM patients had significantly different levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 at each reading point compared to HC. Levels of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly altered over time in FM patients. Compared to HC FM patients showed a significantly different response of IL1, − 6 and − 10 to WBC. Conclusion Serial WBC is a fast acting and effective treatment for FM. Proven effects of WBC may be explained by changes in cytokines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim To evaluate whether dietary pattern changes, antioxidant supplementation or 5–10% weight loss could improve disease activity (skin and joint) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods A total of 97 PsA patients were enrolled in this 12-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups: Diet-placebo (hypocaloric diet + placebo supplementation); Diet-fish (hypocaloric diet + 3 g/day of omega-3 supplementation; and Placebo. Food intake (3-day registry, Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)), body composition (whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), weight and waist circumference) and disease activity (PASI, BSA, BASDAI, DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP and MDA) were evaluated at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Statistical analysis used the intention-to-treat approach. The P value was considered to indicate significance when below 0.05. Results After 12 weeks, DAS28-CRP and BASDAI scores improved, especially in the Diet-placebo group (− 0.6 ± 0.9; p = 0.004 and − 1.39 ± 1.97; p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, a higher proportion of patients achieved minimal disease activity (MDA) in all groups. The Diet-fish group showed significant weight loss (− 1.79 ± 2.4; p = 0.004), as well as waist circumference (− 3.28 ± 3.5, p &lt; 0.001) and body fat (− 1.2 ± 2.2, p = 0.006) reductions. There was no significant correlation between weight loss and disease activity improvement. Each 1-unit increase in the HEI value reduced the likelihood of achieving remission by 4%. Additionally, each 100-cal daily intake increase caused a 3.4-fold DAS28-ESR impairment. Conclusion A 12-week hypocaloric intervention provided suitable control of joint disease activity in patients with PsA, regardless of weight loss. Adding omega-3 supplementation caused relevant body composition changes but not disease activity improvement. Trial Registration : The study was recorded on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03142503).",

Interleukin 10 (IL-10)/interleukin 35 (IL-35) and IL-10/IL-35-producing regulatory B cells have been demonstrated to possess immunosuppressive functions during systemic lupus erythematosus. Here, we detected the proportion of CD19+CD24highCD27+ B cells as well as IL-10 and IL-35 levels in peripheral blood of SLE patients and healthy individuals, and investigated their relations with clinical features of SLE.41 SLE patients and 25 healthy controls were recruited. The patients were divided into groups based on SLEDAI score, anti-dsDNA antibody, rash, nephritis and hematological disorder. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of CD24hiCD27+ B cells. ELISA was used to detect serum levels of IL-10 and IL-35.Our results showed that the CD19+CD24highCD27+ B population was decreased in active SLE patients, and anti-correlated with the disease activity. Of note, we found significant increase of IL-10 and decrease of IL-35 in SLE patients with disease activity score > 4, lupus nephritis or hematological disorders compared to those without related clinical features.Reduced CD19+CD24highCD27+ B cells expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Moreover, we supposed that IL-35 instead of IL-10 played a crucial role in immune regulation during SLE disease.",

However, the pathogenesis of BD remains unclear, and it is believed that immune-inflammatory reactions play a crucial role in its development. Immune cells are a critical component of this process and contribute to the onset and progression of BD. By regulating the function of these immune cells, effective control over the occurrence and development of BD can be achieved, particularly with regards to monocyte activation and aggregation, macrophage differentiation and polarization, as well as T cell subset differentiation. This review provides a brief overview of immune cells and their role in regulating BD progression, which may serve as a theoretical foundation for preventing and treating this disease.",

However, these previous studies were uncontrolled. The current study aimed to compare late- and early-onset SLE patients while controlling for sex and year at diagnosis (± 1 year).The medical records of SLE patients in a lupus cohort from January 1994 to June 2020 were reviewed. Late-onset patients were identified as those with an age at diagnosis ≥ 50 years. The early-onset patients (age at diagnosis < 50 years) were matched by sex and year at diagnosis with the late-onset patients at a ratio of 2:1. Clinical manifestations, disease activity (mSLEDAI-2K), organ damage scores, treatment, and mortality were compared between the two groups.The study comprised 62 and 124 late- and early-onset patients, respectively, with a mean follow-up duration of 5 years. At disease onset, when comparing the early-onset patients with the late-onset patients, the latter group had a higher prevalence rate of serositis (37.0% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.001) and hemolytic anemia (50.0% vs. 33.9%, p = 0.034) but lower prevalence rate of malar rash (14.5% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.001), arthritis (41.9% vs. 62.1%, p = 0.009), leukopenia (32.3% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.022) and lymphopenia (50.0% vs. 66.1%, p = 0.034). The groups had similar SLE disease activity (7.41 vs. 7.50), but the late-onset group had higher organ damage scores (0.37 vs. 0.02, p < 0.001). The rates of treatment with corticosteroids, antimalarial drugs, or immunosuppressive drugs were not different. At their last visit, the late-onset patients still had the same pattern of clinically significant differences except for arthritis; additionally, the late-onset group had a lower rate of nephritis (53.2% vs. 74.2%, p = 0.008). They also had a lower level of disease activity (0.41 vs. 0.57, p = 0.006) and received fewer antimalarials (67.7% vs. 85.5%, p = 0.023) and immunosuppressive drugs (61.3% vs. 78.2%, p = 0.044), but they had higher organ damage scores (1.37 vs. 0.47, p < 0.001) and higher mortality rates/100-person year (3.2 vs. 1.1, p = 0.015). After adjusting for disease duration and baseline clinical variables, the late-onset patients only had lower rate of nephritis (p = 0.002), but still received fewer immunosuppressive drugs (p = 0.005) and had a higher mortality rate (p = 0.037).In this sex- and year at diagnosis-matched controlled study, after adjusting for disease duration and baseline clinical variables, the late-onset SLE patients had less renal involvement and received less aggressive treatment, but had a higher mortality rate than the early-onset patients.",

Objective To determine the prevalence of ExtRA in a large cohort, and its association with demographic and clinical variables. Method Cross-sectional and observational study, based on a multi-centric database from a prospective cohort, in which 11 public rheumatology centres enrolled RA patients (1987 ARA or 2010 ACR-EULAR). Data collection began in 08-2015, using a single online electronic medical record. Continuous variables were compared using Mann–Whitney U -test, and Fisher’s exact test or chi-square test, as appropriate, were used for categorical variables. The level of significance was set at 5% ( p &lt; 0.05). Results 1115 patients were included: 89% women, age [mean ± SD] 58.2 ± 11.5 years, disease duration 14.5 ± 12.2 years, positive Rheumatoid Factor (RF, n = 1108) in 77%, positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACPA, n = 477) in 78%. Regarding ExtRA, 334 occurrences were registered in 261 patients, resulting in an overall prevalence of 23.4% in the cohort. The comparison among ExtRA and Non-ExtRA groups shows significant higher age ( p &lt; 0.001 ), disease duration (p &lt; 0.001 ), RF high titers ( p = 0.018 ), Clinical Disease Activity index (CDAI) ( p &lt; 0.001 ), Disease Activity Index 28 (DAS 28) ( p &lt; 0.001 ), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) ( p &lt; 0.001 ) in ExtRA group. Treatment with Azathioprine ( p = 0.002 ), Etanercept ( p = 0.049) Glucocorticoids (GC) (‘ p = 0.002 ), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ( p &lt; 0.001 ) were more frequent in ExtRA group. Conclusions ExtRA manifestations still show an expressive occurrence that should not be underestimated. Our findings reinforce that long-term seropositive disease, associated with significant disability and persistent inflammatory activity are the key factors related to ExtRA development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hip fractures in the older adults lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Although a low bone mineral density is considered the leading risk factor, it is essential to recognize other factors that could affect the risk of hip fractures. This study aims to evaluate the contribution of clinical characteristics, patient-reported outcomes, and muscle and aerobic capacity for hip fractures in community-dwelling older adults. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study with real world-data from subjects ≥ 60 years old attending an outpatient clinic in Minas Gerais, Brazil, from May 1, 2019, to August 22, 2022. Data about clinical characteristics (multimorbidity, medications of long-term use, sedative and or tricyclic medications, number of falls), patient-reported outcomes (self-perception of health, self-report of difficulty walking, self-report of vision problems, and self-report of falls) and muscle and aerobic capacity (calf circumference, body mass index, and gait speed) were retrieved from an electronic health record. The association of each potential risk factor and hip fracture was investigated by a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex. Results A total of 7,836 older adults were included with a median age of 80 years (IQR 72–86) and 5,702 (72.7%) were female. Hip fractures occurred in 121 (1.54%) patients. Multimorbidity was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture (OR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.06–1.18) and each episode of fall increased the chance of hip fracture by 1.7-fold (OR = 1.69, 95%CI 1.52–1.80). Patient-reported outcomes associated with increased fracture risk were regular or poor self-perception of health (OR = 1.59, 95%CI 1.06–2.37), self-report of walking difficulty (OR = 3.06, 95%CI 1.93–4.84), and self-report of falls (OR = 2.23, 95%CI 1.47–3.40). Body mass index and calf circumference were inversely associated with hip fractures (OR = 0.91, 95%CI 0.87–0.96 and OR = 0.93, 95%CI 0.88–0.97, respectively), while slow gait speed increased the chance of hip fractures by almost two-fold (OR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.22–2.66). Conclusion Our study reinforces the importance of identified risk factors for hip fracture in community-dwelling older adults beyond bone mineral density and available fracture risk assessment tools. Data obtained in primary care can help physicians, other health professionals, and public health policies to identify patients at increased risk of hip fractures.",

Materials and methods The search for articles was conducted systematically through MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. Only articles in English were selected. For available records, titles and abstracts were selected independently by two investigators. Results Eighteen studies were selected for analysis. The known adverse effects of cyclophosphamide were hematological toxicity, infections, gonadal toxicity, teratogenicity, increased risk for malignancy and hemorrhagic cystitis. Long-term toxicity was highly dependent on cyclophosphamide cumulative dose. The risk of bladder cancer is especially higher in long-term exposure and with cumulative doses above 36 g. The risk remains high for years after drug discontinuation. Hemorrhagic cystitis is highly correlated with cumulative dose and its incidence ranges between 12 and 41%, but it seems to be lower with new regimens with reduced cyclophosphamide dose. No randomized controlled trials were found to analyze the use of mesna in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases and systemic vasculitis. Retrospective studies yielded conflicting results. Uncontrolled prospective studies with positive results were considered at high risk of bias. No evidence was found to support the use of mesna during the treatment with cyclophosphamide for autoimmune diseases or systemic vasculitis to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer. In the scenarios of high cumulative cyclophosphamide dose (i.e., &gt; 30 g), patients with restricted fluid intake, neurogenic bladder, therapy with oral anticoagulants, and chronic kidney disease, mesna could be considered. Conclusion The current evidence was found to be insufficient to support the routine use of mesna for the prophylaxis of hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer in patients being treated for systemic autoimmune diseases and systemic vasculitis with cyclophosphamide. The use may be considered for selected cases.",

Methods Two methodologists and 20 rheumatologists from Lupus Comittee of Brazilian Society of Rheumatology participate in the development of this guideline. Fourteen PICO questions were defined and a systematic review was performed. Eligible randomized controlled trials were analyzed regarding complete renal remission, partial renal remission, serum creatinine, proteinuria, serum creatinine doubling, progression to end-stage renal disease, renal relapse, and severe adverse events (infections and mortality). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to develop these recommendations. Recommendations required ≥82% of agreement among the voting members and were classified as strongly in favor, weakly in favor, conditional, weakly against or strongly against a particular intervention. Other aspects of LN management (diagnosis, general principles of treatment, treatment of comorbidities and refractory cases) were evaluated through literature review and expert opinion. Results All SLE patients should undergo creatinine and urinalysis tests to assess renal involvement. Kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing LN but, if it is not available or there is a contraindication to the procedure, therapeutic decisions should be based on clinical and laboratory parameters. Fourteen recommendations were developed. Target Renal response (TRR) was defined as improvement or maintenance of renal function (±10% at baseline of treatment) combined with a decrease in 24-h proteinuria or 24-h UPCR of 25% at 3 months, a decrease of 50% at 6 months, and proteinuria &lt; 0.8 g/24 h at 12 months. Hydroxychloroquine should be prescribed to all SLE patients, except in cases of contraindication. Glucocorticoids should be used at the lowest dose and for the minimal necessary period. In class III or IV (±V), mycophenolate (MMF), cyclophosphamide, MMF plus tacrolimus (TAC), MMF plus belimumab or TAC can be used as induction therapy. For maintenance therapy, MMF or azathioprine (AZA) are the first choice and TAC or cyclosporin or leflunomide can be used in patients who cannot use MMF or AZA. Rituximab can be prescribed in cases of refractory disease. In cases of failure in achieving TRR, it is important to assess adherence, immunosuppressant dosage, adjuvant therapy, comorbidities, and consider biopsy/rebiopsy. Conclusion This consensus provides evidence-based data to guide LN diagnosis and treatment, supporting the development of public and supplementary health policies in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are adaptive mechanisms for conditions of high protein demand, marked by an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Rheumatic autoimmune diseases (RAD) are known to be associated with chronic inflammation and an ERS state. However, the activation of UPR signaling pathways is not completely understood in Sjögren’s disease (SD). This study evaluated the expression of ERS-related genes in glandular tissue of patients with primary SD (pSD), associated SD (aSD) with other autoimmune diseases, and non-Sjögren sicca syndrome (NSS). Methods In a cross-sectional study, minor salivary gland biopsies were obtained from 44 patients with suspected SD and 13 healthy controls (HC). Patients were classified as pSD, aSD, or NSS based on clinical, serological, and histological assessment. Histopathological analysis and mRNA expression analysis of genes associated with ERS and UPR (PERK, XBP1, ATF-6, ATF-4, CANX, CALR, CHOP, and BIP) were performed on the samples. Differences between groups (pSD, aSD, NSS, and HC) were assessed. The influence of chloroquine (CQ) on the ER was also investigated. Results Twenty-eight SD patients showed increased expression of PERK ( p = 0.0117) and XBP1 ( p = 0.0346), and reduced expression of ATF-6 ( p = 0.0003) and CHOP ( p = 0.0003), compared to the HC group. Increased expression of BIP ( p &lt; 0.0001), PERK ( p = 0.0003), CALR ( p &lt; 0.0001), and CANX ( p = 0.0111) was also observed in the SD group compared to the NSS group ( n = 16). Patients receiving CQ ( n = 16) showed a significant increase in ATF-6 ( p = 0.0317) compared to patients not taking the medication ( n = 29). Conclusions Altogether, the results suggest a greater activation of the ERS and UPR genes in patients with SD, especially in the pSD group. Antimalarial drugs, like CQ, used to treat RAD, may affect the ER function in exocrine glands.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate patients with LA who were clinically and serologically very similar to those patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The electronic medical files of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients from a single tertiary rheumatology department between 2017 and 2022 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were being age ≥ 18 years, having nonerosive peripheral arthritis lasting longer than six months, and having dual seropositive (rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (anti-CCP)) serology. A nonerosive course of arthritis was demonstrated by both conventional radiography and joint ultrasound. Images were assessed by two blinded rheumatologists. Patients with drug-induced lupus and those with other rheumatologic diseases were excluded. The cases of 528 patients were reviewed, and eight patients were included in the study. All patients were female, and the median age was 48.5 years. The median SLE and arthritis durations were 12 and seven years, respectively. The most common SLE symptom was photosensitivity (n = 8). Only one patient had life-threatening involvement (LTI), which was a seizure and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. All patients had arthritis affecting the wrist and hand. Anti-dsDNA was the most common anti-ENA antibody (n = 7), followed by anti-SSA (n = 5). The median RF and anti-CCP titres were 82.5 IU/ml and 81.5 U/ml, respectively. Five patients had high titres of autoantibodies, and only one patient had slight hypocomplementemia. Three patients needed biologic agents, and remission was achieved after treatment with rituximab. Despite a long arthritis duration and dual seropositive serology with high titres of RF and anti-CCP, our patients had SLE rather than rhupus syndrome. The low frequency of LTIs, such as lupus nephritis, was a remarkable feature of our patients. Lupus arthritis may be clinically and serologically indistinguishable from RA. Prospective studies are needed to better define LA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurological and psychiatric manifestations occur in patients with primary Sjogren’s disease (SjD) with a wide-ranging clinical presentation, affecting quality of life, social participation, and prognosis. Despite this, neither central nor peripheral neurological symptoms are systematically evaluated in the context of autoimmunity or identified as manifestations of SjD. The EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) covers only part of them in the neurological domain. Methods We performed a systematic review of the diagnosis and prevalence of central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system manifestations in primary SjD, following the recommendations proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Observational studies were included when their main issue was the diagnosis and the prevalence of the manifestations individually. We employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) method with a random-effects model, and the results were computed using logit transformation, implemented through the ‘meta’ and ‘metafor’ packages in the R software (version 3.6.1). To present these recommendations, agreement among experts was investigated using the Delphi method in in-person meetings. Results We propose ten recommendations regarding the investigation and management of neurological involvement in SjD that had 100% agreement among participants. Conclusion These recommendations add to the literature on the clinical care of patients with SjD.",

The aim of this study was to assess psychological disorders and analyze the overall risk of psychological disorders as well as the factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress in ankylosing spondylitis. Patients diagnosed with AS were selected from the China Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry of Patients with Chinese Medicine (CERTAIN) database for data analysis. General demographic characteristics and disease-related features of the patients were collected. The study analyzed clinical differences between patients with and without psychological disorders. Specific clinical characteristics of depression, anxiety, and stress were statistically analyzed. Clinical factors associated with overall psychological status and specific psychological disorders (depression, anxiety and stress) were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. In our study cohort, 26.72% of AS patients were identified with psychological disorders, with 17.5% experiencing depression, 21.1% suffering from anxiety, and 7.9% reporting stress. We also observed significant overlaps among depression, anxiety, and stress in AS patients, with 53.47% experiencing multiple psychological disorders. Disease activity, health index, fatigue levels, and PGA were identified as significant factors associated with psychological disorders. Age, health index, fatigue levels, and PGA were the main influencing factors for depression; disease activity and PGA for anxiety; and disease activity, ASAS-HI, and fatigue for stress. The study reveals a significant prevalence of psychological disorders among individuals with AS, which correlates closely with disease activity, health index, fatigue levels, and PGA. These findings highlight the imperative for assessment of psychological conditions into the comprehensive management approach for AS patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Numerous inflammatory complications related to COVID are described, including the Multisystem inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Hyperinflammation. There is a scarcity of studies comparing these two groups. Methods Retrospective longitudinal outcome-conditioned study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables are analyzed. Patients with history of COVID contact or infection with at least 24 h of fever, two or more systems involved and up to 21 years were included. Patients with no laboratory signal of inflammation or with other diagnoses for the condition were excluded. Demographic and laboratory data are presented as medians with interquartile ranges. Dichotomous variables and prevalences are reported as percentages. A ROC curve analysis was conducted to assess the discriminatory ability of these tests in relation to the MIS-C and hyperinflammation groups. Results We present fifty-four patients, thirty-one with MIS-C and twenty-three with hyperinflammation. The most frequent symptom in the MIS-C group was altered mental status in 61% vs. 46% ( p = 0.014) and conjunctival hyperemia in 29% vs. 4% ( p = 0.032). The most frequent laboratory findings were hypoalbuminemia in 68% vs. 26% ( p = 0.002), increased serum troponin in 42% vs. 26% ( p = 0.034), increased d-dimers in 94% vs. 76% ( p = 0.015), as well as increased BNP in 55% vs. 17% ( p = 0.02). On the other hand, the hyperinflammation group more frequently presented respiratory dysfunction in 57% vs. 13% (p = &lt; 0.001) and serum ferritin equal or greater than 500 ng/mL in 94% vs. 77% ( p = 0.046). Conclusions This is an original study comparing clinical and laboratory findings between MIS-C and hyperinflammation due to COVID. Altered mental status is more frequently associated with MIS-C while respiratory symptoms are associated with hyperinflammation. In addition, regarding laboratory tests, there is hypoalbuminemia, increase in serum troponin, BNP, and D-dimers specially in the MIS-C group and hyperferritinemia in the hyperinflammation group. Further studies are needed to assess the cutoff point of biological markers such as BNP, troponin, and d-dimers for diagnosis and/or prognosis in the pediatric population with MIS-C.",

    "abstract": "Apitoxin®, a drug based on bee venom was approved and released in Korea in 2003 as the ethical drug (ETC). It is well-known for its pain-relieving properties due to its potent anti-inflammatory effects. This raises the question of whether bee venom has benefits for other inflammatory disorders. Since its effectiveness in treating inflammation and pain associated with autoimmune diseases has been observed in several clinical cases in Korea, we conducted an efficacy study using an animal model of the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease with high medical unmet needs. In this research, we aim to confirm the potential therapeutic efficacy for SLE through the immunomodulation induced by bee venom. MRL/FASlpr mice were injected subcutaneously with Apitoxin® and evaluated for clinical parameters including proteinuria, skin lesions, and lymphadenopathy, flow cytometric evaluation of regulatory T cells (Treg), quantitative evaluation of anti-dsDNA antibody in serum by ELISA, and histomorphometric analysis of kidney tissues. Treatment with Apitoxin® revealed a reduction in proteinuria, skin lesions, and lymphadenopathy in MRL/FASlpr mice. The percentage of CD3+CD4+CD25+FoxP3 (Treg) cells, which are associated with autoimmune diseases, was increased compared to the negative control (vehicle). Quantitative analysis of autoantibodies in the blood of MRL/FASlpr mice showed a decreasing tendency in the treatment groups with Apitoxin®. Moreover, mesangial proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration in glomeruli were significantly reduced in the treatment group with Apitoxin®, which was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the amount of IgG infiltrated into the glomeruli. Overall, the results confirmed that Apitoxin® induced clinical improvement in SLE by increasing the proportion of Treg cells and decreasing anti-dsDNA antibodies in the blood, which resulted in therapeutic effects on glomerulonephritis associated with decreased renal infiltration of immune complexes.",

Aim To perform a systematic review on the use of RTX associated with IVIG in autoimmune conditions. Methods PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scielo databases were screened for articles on RTX plus IVIg in autoimmune diseases until May 2024. Results The review encompassed 21 studies evaluating RTX and IVIg for autoimmune diseases. Ten studies focused on pemphigus, involving 85 patients with diverse subtypes (47 pemphigus vulgaris, 27 pemphigoids, and 11 other variants). Most were case reports or series, with one retrospective study including controls. Positive outcomes were reported across all but one case of paraneoplastic pemphigus. Infections, such as P. jirovecii pneumonia, were noted in three studies, highlighting a potential risk. The other 11 studies involved 24 patients with conditions like polyneuropathies, lupus with CNS involvement, and neuromyelitis optica. While most reported favorable outcomes, one trial on IVIg-dependent polyneuropathies found RTX ineffective in reducing IVIg needs. Adverse events included pneumonia, venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and infusion reactions, demonstrating the need for careful monitoring. Conclusion RTX plus IVIg seems to be an alternative option for the treatment of refractory autoimmune diseases. However, more studies with a larger number of participants and in different autoimmune diseases are desired.",

    "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a relevant comorbidity in immune-mediated rheumatic diseases (IMRD). Immune mechanisms have been postulated to trigger FM, potentially leading to distinct clinical features compared to FM occurring without IMRDs. This study aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of FM characteristics in patients with and without concomitant IMRD and to evaluate the differences in diagnostic FM criteria between the two groups. A comprehensive dataset of clinical, psychosocial, and sleep variables, along with validated questionnaires, was prospectively collected from 341 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes who participated in a rheumatology-led, two-week multimodal inpatient program at the University Hospital of Lausanne between 2018 and 2024. Participants were included if they met either the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST) or the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria for FM. The disease activity of the underlying IMRD was assessed by two rheumatologists. Data were separately analyzed in two cohorts: one fulfilling the FiRST criteria and the other fulfilling the ACR 2010 criteria. Among the participants, 153 patients met the FiRST criteria, of whom 34 also had a history of clinically diagnosed IMRD. Similarly, 149 patients fulfilled the ACR 2010 criteria, with 32 of them also having IMRD. The most common IMRDs were HLA-B27-negative spondyloarthritis (53%), Sjögren's syndrome (16%), HLA-B27-positive spondyloarthritis (9%), psoriatic arthritis (9%), seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (9%), and seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (3%). In 88% of patients with IMRD, the disease was considered inactive. No significant clinical or epidemiological differences were found between FM patients with or without IMRD in either the FiRST or ACR 2010 cohorts, except for a higher prevalence of enthesopathies and childhood pain in patients with concomitant IMRD. FM patients with IMRD had slightly lower FiRST scores, and FiRST-positive IMRD patients showed a better short-term response to the multimodal program, particularly in FABQ-work, BPI-interference, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores. However, no significant difference was observed in the Pain Disability Index (PDI) three months post-program. HLA-B27-negative spondyloarthritis and Sjögren's syndrome were the most common concomitant IMRDs in this FM cohort. FM patients with and without IMRD exhibited similar clinical and epidemiological features, suggesting a common pathophysiological background. The FiRST criteria, which emphasize central hypersensitization rather than diffuse pain, appear to be a suitable tool for detecting FM in IMRD patients. This may be particularly useful in cases where enthesial pain might interfere with FM diagnosis, and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "There are few data on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and management of RA in Brazil, even with the recognition of the high direct, indirect and societal costs of this disease. Herein, we report the formation of the REAL - Rheumatoid Arthritis in Real Life, the first nationally representative multicenter prospective observational study in Brazil. The REAL study was designed to include a total of 1300 evaluable patients from 13 tertiary care public health centers specialized in RA management and representative of 5 regions of Brazil. Each center was expected to enroll ~ 100 consecutively seen patients and follow them prospectively in a systematic protocol-driven fashion with scheduled visits at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Core clinical, laboratory and patient-reported outcomes measures were required to be collected at each visit. A total of 1115 patients (89.4% female, mean age of 56.7 years and median disease duration of 12.7 years) were enrolled from 11 participating centers. Almost 80% of patients were of middle-low or low socioeconomic classes. The median educational time was 8 years, with 3.23% being below literacy level. The interval between symptoms and diagnosis varied from 1 to 457 months (median 12 months). Almost half of the patients were on glucocorticoids, 96.5% on DMARDs, with 35.7% on biologics. Median HAQ-DI was 0.875, ranging from 0 to 3. Median DAS28-ESR was 3.5, with 58.7% of patients presenting moderate or high disease activity. The first large cohort of Brazilian patients with RA in a real-life setting shows several striking differences from previously published cohorts from other countries. The long delay for diagnosis and start of DMARDs may partly explain the high frequency of erosive disease. An elevated percentage of patients on moderate or high disease activity was seen, despite of the high frequency of corticosteroid and biologics utilization. Data from this cohort may enable public health managers of developing countries better allocate the limited resources available for the care of RA patients.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, we are facing an alarming epidemic scenario of Yellow fever (YF), which is reaching the most populous areas of the country in unvaccinated people. Vaccination is the only effective tool to prevent YF. In special situations, such as patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (CIMID), undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, as a higher risk of severe adverse events may occur, assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of the yellow fever vaccine (YFV) should be performed on an individual level. Faced with the scarcity of specific orientation on YFV for this special group of patients, the Brazilian Rheumatology Society (BRS) endorsed a project aiming the development of individualized YFV recommendations for patients with CIMID, guided by questions addressed by both medical professionals and patients, followed an internationally validated methodology (GIN-McMaster Guideline Development). Firstly, a systematic review was carried out and an expert panel formed to take part of the decision process, comprising BRS clinical practitioners, as well as individuals from the Brazilian Dermatology Society (BDS), Brazilian Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Study Group (GEDIIB), and specialists on infectious diseases and vaccination (from Tropical Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Immunizations National Societies); in addition, two representatives of patient groups were included as members of the panel. When the quality of the evidence was low or there was a lack of evidence to determine the recommendations, the decisions were based on the expert opinion panel and a Delphi approach was performed. A recommendation was accepted upon achieving ≥80% agreement among the panel, including the patient representatives. As a result, eight recommendations were developed regarding the safety of YFV in patients with CIMID, considering the immunosuppression degree conferred by the treatment used. It was not possible to establish recommendations on the effectiveness of YFV in these patients as there is no consistent evidence to support these recommendations. This paper approaches a real need, assessed by clinicians and patient care groups, to address specific questions on the management of YFV in patients with CIMID living or traveling to YF endemic areas, involving specialists from many areas together with patients, and might have global applicability, contributing to and supporting vaccination practices. We recommended a shared decision-making approach on taking or not the YFV.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive immune cells, including CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, are important for maintaining immunological tolerance. In human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells are reduced, whereas CD69 expression is increased, resulting in a homeostatic immune imbalance that may intensify autoreactive T cell activity. To analyze the mechanisms implicated in autotolerance failure, we evaluated CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells and interleukin profiles in a pristane-induced SLE experimental model. For lupus induction, 26 female Balb/c mice received a single intraperitoneal 0.5 ml dose of pristane, and 16 mice received the same dose of saline. Blood and spleen samples were collected from euthanized mice 90 and 120 days after pristane or saline inoculation. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMC), peritoneal lavage (PL) and splenocytes were obtained by erythrocyte lysis and cryopreserved for further evaluation by flow cytometry using the GuavaEasyCyte TM HT. After thawing, cells were washed and stained with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD28, CD69, FoxP3, CD14 and Ly6C (BD Pharmingen TM). Interleukins were quantified using Multiplex® MAP. The Mann-Whitney test and the Pearson coefficient were used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 considered significant. Compared with the controls, SLE-induced animals presented increased numbers of CD4+CD69+ T cells in the blood on T90 and T120 (p = 0.022 and p = 0.008) and in the spleen on T120 (p = 0.049), but there were decreased numbers in the PL (p = 0.049) on T120. The percentage of Treg was lower in blood (p < 0.005 and p < 0.012) on T90 and T120, in spleen (p = 0.043) on T120 and in PL (p = 0.001) on T90. Increased numbers of CD4 + CD69+ T cells in the PL were positively associated with high IL-2 (p = 0.486) and IFN-γ (p = 0.017) levels, whereas reduced Treg cells in the blood were negatively correlated with TNFα levels (p = 0.043) and positively correlated with TGFβ1 (p = 0.038). Increased numbers of CD4+CD69+ T cells and reduced numbers of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells with an altered interleukin profile suggests loss of autotolerance in pristane-induced lupus mice, which is similar to human lupus. Therefore, this model is useful in evaluating mechanisms of cellular activation, peripheral tolerance and homeostatic immune imbalance involved in human SLE.",

The genetic–environmental factors seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and the disease debilitates patients during the most productive stages of their lives. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between two environmental factors, diet and air pollution with disease activity and functional impairment in AS. A case-control study was carried out. Thirty patients with AS and 30 age and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Disease scores including BASMI, BASDAI, BASFI, and BASG were calculated by means of the international Ankylosing Spondylitis Assessment working group consensus recommendations. The food intake was evaluated by semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (147 items FFQ). Level of air pollution indices, PM10 and PM2.5 information was obtained from the Tehran air quality control network. Total energy and fat intake, some vitamins (A, B1, B2, C) and mineral intake (potassium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, copper and selenium) were significantly higher in patients with AS compared to controls. Fat component consumption especially Saturated Fat of Food was moderately correlated with BASFI score. PM2.5 long term exposure was strongly correlated with BASMI, BASFI and BASDAI scores of patients. High-fat diet and long term exposure to air pollution are associated with worse disease outcomes reported in patients with AS.

    "abstract": "Though gout is more prevalent in men than women, it remains unclear whether gender influences risk factors for incident gout. We aimed to systematically review all cohort studies examining risk factors for the development of gout by gender. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2019. Risk factors for gout examined were: age, ethnicity, consumption of alcohol, meat, seafood, dairy products, purine-rich vegetables, coffee and fructose, vitamin C intake, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, metabolic syndrome, BMI, waist and chest circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, weight change, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemias, renal disease, psoriasis, hypertension, diuretic use and anti-diabetic medication. Cohort studies were included if examining (at least) one of these risk factors for gout in either gender in the general population or primary care. Sample characteristics from included articles and their reported risk estimates were described using narrative synthesis. Thirty-three articles were included, 20 (60.6%)directly compared risk factors by gender, 10 (30.3%) used men-only samples, 3 (9.1%) used women-only samples. Articles comparing risk across genders found similar increases in most risk factors. However, in men, metabolic syndrome (Hazard Ratio (95% CI) 1.37(1.20–1.58)) presented a risk of incident gout compared to none in women (> 50 years 1.15(0.85–1.54); ≤50 years 1.29(0.76–2.17)). Compared to men, women showed greater associated risk with higher consumption of fish and shellfish (HR (95% CI) Men: 1.02 (0.86–1.22); Women 1.36 (1.12–1.65)). Risk factors for developing gout did not typically differ between genders and therefore similar preventative advice can be provided. Exceptions were metabolic syndrome in men and excessive seafood consumption in women, but these singular articles need further examination and in general more research into the risk factors for gout which includes women is required.",

The classification axial spondyloarthritis is adopted when the spine and/or the sacroiliac joints are predominantly involved. This version of recommendations replaces the previous guidelines published in May 2013. A systematic literature review was performed, and two hundred thirty-seven studies were selected and used to formulate 29 recommendations answering 15 clinical questions, which were divided into four sections: diagnosis, non-pharmacological therapy, conventional drug therapy and biological therapy. For each recommendation the level of evidence supporting (highest available), the strength grade according to Oxford, and the degree of expert agreement (inter-rater reliability) is informed. These guidelines bring evidence-based information on clinical management of axial SpA patients, including, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a clinically complex and challenging disease, that leads to skin fibrosis. Its most frequent complication is interstitial lung disease (ILD), which leads to a worse prognosis. In this situation, cyclophosphamide is considered the gold standard for its treatment, despite the controversies regarding its efficacy and toxicity. However, studies using rituximab (RTX) have shown that this drug may be a promising therapeutic option. Objectives This paper objective was to analyze the scientific evidence on the RTX effects on SSc. Methods A systematic review (SR) was performed including clinical trials (CTs) on the use of RTX in SSc, published up to May 2020. The studies were identified through systematic searches in bibliographic databases using a predefined search strategy. The following databases were used: PUBMED, SCOPUS, SCIELO, LILACS, SCIENCE DIRECT, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE, WHOLIS, PAHO and EMBASE. Also, a manual search was performed. The methodological quality of the studies was determined using Jadad scale, Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I). A meta-analysis of the randomized CTs was performed, using Review Manager. Results Ten CTs were included in this SR. Of these, three were randomized and seven were non-randomized. Five showed a statistically significant improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) at some time during follow-up. Regarding the skin, eight studies showed statistically significant improvements according toa the modified Rodnan skin score. The meta-analysis found positive effects of RTX in SSc, with a statistical significance for lung disease. Conclusion Rituximab is a promising strategy for the SSc-associated ILD and cutaneous fibrosis treatment. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019132018.",

The groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory findings and anthropometric measurements, body composition, physical function tests, osteoarthritis severity, quality of life, and posturography.200 patients were included in the study. 98 (82.6% female) were in Group 1 and 102 (74.5% female) in Group 2. Age was higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2 [61 (50-70) and 57.5 (50-70), respectively, p = 0.03]. Symptom duration was also longer in Group 1 (5.21 ± 4.76 and 3.38 ± 3.58, p = 0.002).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a prominent role in rheumatoid synovitis and degradation of the extracellular matrix through the production of inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases (MMPs). Since animal models are frequently used for elucidating the disease mechanism and therapeutic development, it is relevant to study the ultrastructural characteristics and functional responses in human and mouse FLS. The objective of the study was to analyze ultrastructural characteristics, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) production and the activation of intracellular pathways in Fibroblast like synoviocytes (FLS) cultures obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and from mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods FLSs were obtained from RA patients (RA-FLSs) (n = 8) and mice with CIA (CIA-FLSs) (n = 4). Morphology was assessed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. IL-6 and MMP-3 production was measured by ELISA, and activation of intracellular signaling pathways (NF-κB and MAPK: p-ERK1/2, p-P38 and p-JNK) was measured by Western blotting in cultures of RA-FLSs and CIA-FLSs stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β. Results RA-FLS and CIA-FLS cultures exhibited rich cytoplasm, rough endoplasmic reticula and prominent and well-developed Golgi complexes. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of lamellar bodies, which are cytoplasmic structures related to surfactant production, in FLSs from both sources. Increased levels of pinocytosis and numbers of pinocytotic vesicles were observed in RA-FLSs ( p &lt; 0.05). Basal production of MMP-3 and IL-6 was present in RA-FLSs and CIA-FLSs. Regarding the production of MMP-3 and IL-6 and the activation of signaling pathways, the present study demonstrated a lower response to IL-1β by CIA-FLSs than by RA-FLSs. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the biology of RA-FLS and CIA-FLS. The differences and similarities in ultrastructural morphology and important inflammatory cytokines shown, contribute to future in vitro studies using RA-FLS and CIA-FLS, in addition, they indicate that the adoption of CIA-FLS for studies should take careful and be well designed, since they do not completely resemble human diseases.",

Here, we investigated its real-life effectiveness and tolerability in a cohort of AS and PsA patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed medical records of outpatients with AS or PsA treated with secukinumab between December 2017 and December 2019. ASDAS-CRP and DAS28-CRP scores were used to measure axial and peripheral disease activity in AS and PsA, respectively. Data were collected at baseline and after 8, 24, and 52 weeks of treatment. Results Eighty-five adult patients with active disease (29 with AS and 56 with PsA; 23 males and 62 females) were treated. Overall, mean disease duration was 6.7 years and biologic-naïve patients were 85%. Significant reductions in ASDAS-CRP and DAS28-CRP were observed at all time-points. Body weight (in AS) and disease activity status at baseline (particularly in PsA) significantly affected disease activity changes. ASDAS-defined inactive disease and DAS28-defined remission were achieved in comparable proportions between AS and PsA patients, at both 24 weeks (45% and 46%) and 52 weeks (65.5% and 68%, respectively); male sex was found an independent predictor of positive response (OR 5.16, P = 0.027). After 52 weeks, achievement of at least low disease activity and drug retention were observed in 75% of patients. Secukinumab was well-tolerated and only mild injection-site reactions were recorded in 4 patients. Conclusion In a real-world setting, secukinumab confirmed great effectiveness and safety in both AS and PsA patients. The influence of gender on treatment response deserves further attention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) offers an opportunity for better treatment outcomes. In real-life settings, grasping this opportunity might depend on access to specialized care. We evaluated the effects of early versus late assessment by the rheumatologist on the diagnosis, treatment initiation and long-term outcomes of RA under real-life conditions. Methods Adults meeting the ACR/EULAR (2010) or ARA (1987) criteria for RA were included. Structured interviews were conducted. The specialized assessment was deemed “early” when the rheumatologist was the first or second physician consulted after symptoms onset, and “late” when performed afterwards. Delays in RA diagnosis and treatment were inquired. Disease activity (DAS28-CRP) and physical function (HAQ-DI) were evaluated. Student’s t, Mann-Whitney U, chi-squared and correlation tests, and multiple linear regression were performed. For sensitivity analysis, a propensity score-matched subsample of early- vs. late-assessed participants was derived based on logistic regression. The study received ethical approval; all participants signed informed consent. Results We included 1057 participants (89.4% female, 56.5% white); mean (SD) age: 56.9 (11.5) years; disease duration: 173.1 (114.5) months. Median (IQR) delays from symptoms onset to both RA diagnosis and initial treatment coincided: 12 (6–36) months, with no significant delay between diagnosis and treatment. Most participants (64.6%) first sought a general practitioner. Notwithstanding, 80.7% had the diagnosis established only by the rheumatologist. Only a minority (28.7%) attained early RA treatment (≤ 6 months of symptoms). Diagnostic and treatment delays were strongly correlated (rho 0.816; p &lt; 0.001). The chances of missing early treatment more than doubled when the assessment by the rheumatologist was belated (OR 2.77; 95% CI: 1.93, 3.97). After long disease duration, late-assessed participants still presented lower chances of remission/low disease activity (OR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.99), while the early-assessed ones showed better DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI scores (difference in means [95% CI]: -0.25 [-0.46, -0.04] and − 0.196 [-0.306, -0.087] respectively). The results in the propensity-score matched subsample confirmed those observed in the original (whole) sample. Conclusions Early diagnosis and treatment initiation in patients with RA was critically dependent on early access to the rheumatologist; late specialized assessment was associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes.",

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Participants with knee OA Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1 to 3 and VAS of symptoms ≥4 cm were randomized to receive GS/CS or Cosamin DS® over 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic efficacy by the investigator. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: joint pain and swelling, investigator efficacy of the medication, and the use of rescue medication. Adverse events and drug tolerability were analyzed. One hundred patients were randomized, and 50 patients were allocated to each group. The analgesic efficacy evaluated by the investigator in the GS/CS group was 88.9, 95%CI: 75.2, 95.8% and in the Cosamin DS® group was 85.4%; 95%CI: 70.1, 93.4%. The mean reduction in the pain intensity was significant in both groups (p < 0.001), with no difference between them. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated the non-inferiority of the GS/CS group compared with the Cosamin DS® group; the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval (CI) between the two groups (− 8.39%) was higher than the established margin of non-inferiority of − 10.00%. Improvement in other efficacy outcomes was observed, again without differences between groups. Adverse events were similar between groups and both presented good tolerability.

Intravenous immunoglobulin is considered in induction for refractory cases of SAM or when immunosuppressive drugs are contra-indicated. Consideration should be given to the early introduction of immunosuppressive drugs. There is no specific period determined for the suspension of glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive drugs when individually evaluating patients with SAM.

Thus, early diagnosis of nail involvement may be essential for better management of PsO and PsA. Ultrasonography is considered a highly promising method to visualize nail disease. The main aim of this review was to evaluate the use of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of nail disease in patients with PsO and PsA by reviewing ultrasound parameters with the best diagnostic accuracy. Main body of the abstract: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE via the PubMed and LILACS databases. Conference proceedings of relevant rheumatology scientific meetings were also screened. After applying eligibility criteria, only 13 articles and 5 abstracts were included in this review. The selected studies showed a huge variability in evaluation methods (and therefore in the results) and were mainly focused on the assessment of nails ultrasound parameters that may differ among patients and healthy controls, especially the morphological aspects in B-mode ultrasonography and vascularization of the nail bed by Doppler ultrasonography. Our research indicated that the evaluation of nail disease in PsO and PsA is still underrepresented in the literature, probably reflecting a restricted use in clinical practice, despite the widespread use of ultrasonography in the management of chronic arthritis. Despite the potential relevance of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of nail disease, additional studies are needed to determine which features are more reliable and clinically pertinent to ensure accuracy in the evaluation of nail involvement in PsO and PsA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives The cross-sectional study aimed to assess left ventricular systolic function using global longitudinal strain (GLS) by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and arterial stiffness using cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in Thai adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods Confirmed RA patients were selected from a list of outpatient attendees if they were 18 years (y) without clinical, ECG and echocardiographic evidence of CVD, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and excess alcoholic intake. Controls were matched with age and sex to a list of healthy individuals with normal echocardiograms. All underwent STE and CAVI. Results 60 RA patients (females = 55) were analysed. Mean standard deviation of patient and control ages were 50 ± 10.2 and 51 ± 9.9 y, respectively, and mean duration of RA was 9.0 ± 6.8 y. Mean DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR were 2.9 ± 0.9 and 3.4 ± 0.9, respectively. There was no between-group differences in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV sizes, LVMI, LV diastolic function and CAVI were within normal limits but all GLSs values was significantly lower in patients vs. controls: 17.6 ± 3.4 vs 20.4 ± 2.2 ( p = 0.03 ). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated significant correlations between GLSs and RA duration ( p = 0.02 ), and GLSs and DAS28-CRP ( p = 0.041 ). Conclusions Patients with RA and no clinical CV disease have reduced LV systolic function as shown by lower GLSs. It is common and associated with disease activity and RA disease duration. 2D speckle-tracking GLSs is robust in detecting this subclinical LV systolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a musculoskeletal chronic pain syndrome that impacts negatively patient’s daily lives. Its pathogenesis is characterized by a complex relationship between biological and psychosocial factors not fully understood yet. Pain catastrophizing is associated with FM and is an important predictor of outcomes. This study aimed to answer two questions: (i) whether the allele and genotype frequencies of BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism differs between FM patients and healthy controls (HC); and (ii) if the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is a factor that predicts pain catastrophizing in FM. Methods In a cross-sectional design, 108 FM patients and 108 HC were included. FM patients responded to the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (BP-PCS) to assess pain catastrophizing, as well as other validated tools for anxiety (The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II – BDI-II) and functional aspects (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire - FIQ; Central Sensitization Inventory validated and adapted for Brazilian population - CSI-BP; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - PSQI; and Resilience Scale). All subjects were genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. Results Val allele was significantly more frequent in FM patients compared to the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). Also, FM patients with Val/Val genotype showed more pain catastrophizing thoughts, and this genotype was significantly associated with magnification and rumination dimensions of BP-PCS ( p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, there were significant differences in levels of anxiety and symptoms of depression, years of education, and the functional situation between the FM and control groups. Conclusions The findings show an association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with pain catastrophizing in FM, which opens new avenues to comprehend the interplay between molecular genetic characteristics and neuroplasticity mechanisms underpinning FM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Takayasu’s arteritis (TA) affects young women in the childbearing age group. We studied obstetric outcomes in these patients before and after disease onset. Methods Women aged more than 18 years with Takayasu’s arteritis (ACR 1990 criteria) were included. Demographic data, clinical features, disease activity using Indian Takayasu Arteritis clinical score (ITAS), Disease Extent Index for TA (DEI.TaK) and damage assessment using TA Damage score (TA), history of conception and maternal and fetal outcomes were recorded from hospital records and telephonic interview. Results are in median and IQR. Results Of the 64 women interviewed, aged 29 (24–38) years and disease duration 5 (4–10) years, 74 and 38 pregnancies had occurred before and after disease diagnosis in 29 and 20 women respectively. In eight, the diagnosis was made during pregnancy. Age at disease onset was 22 (18–30) years. Type 5 disease was the most common ( n = 32, 59.3%), and an equal number of patients had Ishikawa’s class I and II disease ( n = 26, 40.6%). Median ITAS ( n = 44) was 13 (7–16), DEI.Tak 12.5 (9–16.75) and TADS 8 (6.5–10). Twenty-five patients wanted to get pregnant, of which 8 (32%) did not do so because of their disease. Fifteen were unmarried of whom 6 did not marry due to disease. Obstetric outcomes were poorer in pregnancies that occurred after the onset of disease as compared with those before it (RR = 1.5, p = 0.01). Pregnancies after the onset of TA carried a very high risk of maternal [RR3.9 (1.8–8.5), P &lt; 0.001] as well as fetal complications [RR = 2.0 (1.2–3.4), p = 0.001]. Hypertension was the most common maternal complication and occurred most often in the last trimester. The baby weight at birth was lower in pregnancies after disease (2.3 vs. 3.0, p = 0.01). Wong’s score greater than or equal to 4 predicted lower birth weight ( p = 0.04). ITAS, ITAS-A, DEI. Tak and TADS could not predict obstetric outcomes, and ITAS score exhibited moderate correlation with DEI. Tak ( r = 0.78) and TADS ( r = 0.58). Conclusion Women with TA suffer from extremely high risk of poor maternal and foetal outcomes. Wong’s scoring can be useful to predict birth weight.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and fibrosis, which can be subclassified into diffuse cutaneous (dSSc) and limited cutaneous (lSSc) subtypes. Previous studies suggest that an increase in monocytes can be a hallmark of various inflammatory diseases, including SSc. Our aim was to evaluate circulating blood monocyte subpopulations (classical, intermediate and non-classical) of SSc patients and their possible association with disease manifestations. Methods Fifty consecutive patients fulfilling the 2013 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SSc were included in a cross-sectional study. Monocyte subpopulations were identified based on their expression of CD64, CD14 and CD16, evaluated by flow cytometry, and were correlated with the clinical characteristics of the patients; furthermore, the expression of HLA-DR, CD163, CD169 and CD206 in the monocytes was studied. Thirty-eight age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited as a control group. Results SSc patients had an increased number of circulating peripheral blood monocytes with an activated phenotypic profile compared to healthy subjects. Absolute counts of CD16+ (intermediary and non-classical) monocyte subpopulations were higher in SSc patients. There was no association between monocyte subpopulations and the clinical manifestations evaluated. Conclusion We identified higher counts of all monocyte subpopulations in SSc patients compared to the control group. There was no association between monocyte subpopulations and major fibrotic manifestations. CD169 was shown to be more representative in dSSc, being a promising marker for differentiating disease subtypes.",

    "abstract": "The management of anxiety and depression symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is vital. Previous study findings on this topic are conflicting, and the topic remains to be thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to clarify the association of RA disease activity with anxiety and depression symptoms after controlling for physical disability, pain, and medication.We conducted a cross-sectional study of RA patients from the XXX Rheumatoid Arthritis Management Alliance cohort. We assessed patients using the Disease Activity Score (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Anxiety and depression symptoms were defined by a HADS score ≥ 8. We analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression analyses.Of 517 participants, 17.6% had anxiety symptoms and 27.7% had depression symptoms. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that DAS28 was not independently associated with anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval; CI] 0.93 [0.48-1.78]; p = 0.82) and depression symptoms (OR [95% CI] 1.45 [0.81-2.61]; p = 0.22). However, DAS28 patient global assessment (PtGA) severity was associated with anxiety symptoms (OR [95% CI] 1.15 [1.02-1.29]; p = 0.03) and depression symptoms (OR [95% CI] 1.21 [1.09-1.35]; p < 0.01). Additionally, HAQ-DI scores ≤ 0.5 were associated with anxiety symptoms (OR [95% CI] 3.51 [1.85-6.64]; p < 0.01) and depression symptoms (OR [95% CI] 2.65 [1.56-4.50]; p < 0.01). Patients using steroids were more likely to have depression than those not using steroids (OR [95% CI] 1.66 [1.03-2.67]; p = 0.04).No association was found between RA disease activity and anxiety and depression symptoms in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Patients with high PtGA scores or HAQ-DI scores ≤ 0.5 were more likely to experience anxiety and depression symptoms, irrespective of disease activity remission status. Rather than focusing solely on controlling disease activity, treatment should focus on improving or preserving physical function and the patient's overall sense of well-being.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease characterized by degradation of articular cartilage that leads to chronic inflammation. Exercise programs and photobiomodulation (PBM) are capable of modulating the inflammatory process of minimizing functional disability related to knee OA. However, their association on the concentration of biomarkers related to OA development has not been studied yet. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of PBM (via cluster) with a physical exercise program in functional capacity, serum inflammatory and cartilage degradation biomarkers in patients with knee OA. Methods Forty-two patients were randomly allocated in 3 groups: ESP: exercise + sham PBM; EAP: exercise + PBM and CG: control group. Six patients were excluded before finished the experimental period. The analyzed outcomes in baseline and 8-week were: the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and the evaluation of serum biomarkers concentration (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 e TNF-α, and CTX-II). Results An increase in the functional capacity was observed in the WOMAC total score for both treated groups (p &lt; 0.001) and ESP presents a lower value compared to CG (p &lt; 0.05) the 8-week post-treatment. In addition, there was a significant increase in IL-10 concentration of EAP (p &lt; 0.05) and higher value compared to CG (p &lt; 0.001) the 8-week post-treatment. Moreover, an increase in IL-1β concentration was observed for CG (p &lt; 0.05). No other difference was observed comparing the other groups. Conclusion Our data suggest that the physical exercise therapy could be a strategy for increasing functional capacity and in association with PBM for increasing IL-10 levels in OA knee individuals.

In addition to joint involvement, RA patients frequently have other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases. Drugs used for RA treatment may increase or decrease the risk of a cardiovascular event. This study aims to analyze cardiovascular risk comorbidities in patients with RA and the correlation with the use of anti-rheumatic drugs.Cross-sectional study conducted based on the real-life rheumatoid arthritis study database - REAL, a prospective observational cohort study. Associations between the use of anti-rheumatic drugs and the presence of comorbidities were represented by their prevalence ratio and evaluated using the Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests.We assessed 1116 patients, 89.4% women, mean age of 55.15 years and predominance of seropositive disease. 63.3% had some cardiovascular comorbidity, predominantly hypertension (49.9%). The use of glucocorticoids was observed in 47.4% of patients and there was a significant tendency of lower use of these drugs in the presence of dyslipidemia (PR: 0.790; p = 0.007). We observed that the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities was associated with higher use of bDMARDs (PR:1.147; p = 0.003).The presence of cardiovascular risk comorbidities was confirmed to be higher in RA patients. Different treatment strategies using less glucocorticoids in the presence of dyslipidemia and more common use of bDMARDs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities suggest that rheumatologists are aware of the potential influence of the DMARDs in the risk of cardiovascular event. Reinforcing these results, we highlight the need for a better baseline assessment to guide the choice of anti-rheumatic drugs in RA patients who have comorbidities.",

Then, the value of biomarkers for the diagnosis and evaluation of CTD-ILD was assessed through high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings and pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters.The serum MMP-9, SP-D, and VEGF levels in the CTD-ILD group were higher than those in the CTD-NILD group and healthy group. The ROC curve indicates that VEGF has good to excellent diagnostic performance in diagnosing CTD-ILD, the cut-off that best optimizes sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing CTD-ILD is 277.60 pg/ml (sensitivity, 87.9%; specificity, 83.6%), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.842-0.968); The ROC curve for MMP-9 suggests this biomarker is fair for diagnosis of CTD-ILD(sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 81.8%), with an AUC of 0.867 (95% CI 0.784-0.950), but SP-D only provided lower specificity with higher sensitivity in diagnosing CTD-ILD(sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 40.0%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary systemic vasculitis in people 50 years of age and over, and it is considered a medical emergency due to the potential risk of permanent visual loss. Color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) of the temporal arteries is a rapid, noninvasive method to diagnose GCA. This study aims to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the halo sign in temporal arteries by CDU in people with suspected GCA. Methods The systematic literature review included the search for publications in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, gray literature up to December 2022, and no date or language restrictions were applied. We analyzed studies including patients over 50 years of age with suspected GCA evaluating CDU of temporal arteries as a diagnostic tool against clinical diagnosis as a standard reference. Paper titles and abstracts were selected by two investigators independently for all available records. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2) and the R software (version 4.2.1) was used for data analysis. The protocol of this review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016033079). Results Twenty-two studies including 2893 participants with suspected GCA who underwent temporal artery CDU were evaluated. The primary analysis results showed a sensitivity of 0.76 [95% confidence interval (95 CI) 0.69–0.81] and specificity of 0.93 (95 CI 0.89–0.95) when the halo sign was compared to clinical diagnosis. The sensitivity value of 0.84 (95 CI 0.72–0.92) and specificity of 0.95 (95 CI 0.88–0.98) were found in five studies involving 1037 participants that analyzed the halo sign and temporal artery compression sign. A sensitivity of 0.86 (95 CI 0.78–0.91) and specificity of 0.95 (95 CI 0.89–0.98) were found in four studies with 603 participants where the halo sign was evaluated CDU on temporal and axillary arteries. Conclusion The detection of the halo sign by CDU of temporal arteries has good accuracy for the diagnosis of cranial GCA. The compression sign in temporal arteries and the addition of axillary arteries assessment improves the diagnostic performance of CDU for GCA. Trial registration PROSPERO CRD42016046860.",

The American-European Consensus Group (AECG 2002) and the American-European classification criteria of 2016 (ACR/EULAR 2016) emerged through a search for consensus. This study aims to assess the prevalence of Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), according to AECG 2002 and ACR-EULAR 2016 classifications, as well as clinical and histopathological features in this overlap. To date, there is no study that has evaluated SS in SLE, using the two current criteria. Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated 237 SLE patients at the outpatient rheumatology clinic between 2016 and 2018. Patients were submitted to a dryness questionnaire, whole unstimulated salivary flow (WUSF), “Ocular Staining Score” (OSS), Schirmer’s test I (ST-I), and labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB). Results After verifying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 117 patients were evaluated, with predominance of females (94%) and mixed ethnicity (49.6%). The prevalence of SS was 23% according to AECG 2002 and 35% to ACR-EULAR 2016. Kappa agreement between AECG 2002 and ACR-EULAR 2016 were 0.7 ( p &lt; 0.0001). After logistic regression, predictors for SS were: anti/Ro (OR = 17.86, p &lt; 0.05), focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (OR = 3.69, p &lt; 0.05), OSS ≥ 5 (OR = 7.50, p &lt; 0.05), ST I positive (OR = 2.67, p &lt; 0.05), and WUSF ≤ 0.1 mL/min (OR = 4.13, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The prevalence of SS in SLE was 23% (AECG 2002) and 35% (ACR-EULAR 2016). The presence of glandular dysfunction, focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, and anti/Ro were predictors of SS in SLE. The greatest advantage of the new ACR-EULAR 2016 criteria is to enable an early diagnosis and identify the overlapping of these two diseases. ACR-EULAR 2016 criteria is not yet validated for secondary SS and this study is a pioneer in investigating prevalence based on the new criteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) patients face several challenges due to the nature of the disease and its physical and psychological complications. Sleep disorders are among the most important concerns. Sleep disorders can aggravate the signs and symptoms of the disease and ultimately reduce the quality of patients’ lives. This study uses a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool the reported prevalence of sleep disorders among AS patients. Methods To find related studies, the WoS, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched without a lower time limit. Heterogeneity among the identified studies was checked using the I 2 index, and the Begg and Mazumdar correlation test examined the existence of published bias. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (v.2) software was adopted to analyze the data. Results In the review of 18 studies with a sample size of 5,840, the overall pooled prevalence of sleep disorders among AS patients based on the random effects method was found to be 53% (95% CI: 44.9–61). The highest and lowest prevalence was in Egypt at 90% and Australia at 19.2%, respectively. Our meta-regression results show that with the increase in ‘sample size’ and ‘year of publication’, the overall prevalence of sleep disorders in patients with AS decreases (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The results of the present study indicate a high and significant prevalence of sleep disorders among AS patients. Thus, health policymakers and healthcare providers must focus on timely diagnosis and effective educational and therapeutic interventions for the prevention and proper treatment of sleep disorders in this population of patients.",

    "abstract": "The deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals within synovial joints and tissues is the initiating factor for gout arthritis. Thus, MSU crystals are a vital tool for studying gout's molecular mechanism in animal and cellular models. This study mainly compared the excellence and worseness of MSU crystals prepared by different processes and the degree of inflammation induced by MSU crystals.MSU crystals were prepared using neutralization, alkali titration, and acid titration methods. The crystals' shape, length, quality, and uniformity were observed by polarized light microscopy and calculated by the software Image J. The foot pad and air pouch models were used to assess the different degrees of inflammation induced by the MSU crystals prepared by the three different methods at different time points. Paw swelling was evaluated by caliper. In air pouch lavage fluid, inflammatory cell recruitment was measured by hemocytometer, and the level of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-18 by ELISA. Inflammatory cell infiltration was assayed by immunohistochemistry of air pouch synovial slices.For the preparation of MSU crystals with the same uric acid, the quantity acquired by the alkalization method was highest, followed by neutralization, with the acid titration method being the lowest. The crystals prepared by neutralization were the longest. The swelling index of the foot pad induced by MSU crystals prepared by acid titration was significantly lower than that of the other methods at 24 h. The inflammatory cell recruitment and level of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-18 in air pouch lavage fluid were lowest in animals with crystals prepared by acid titration. IL-1β secretion induced by MSU crystals prepared by acid titration was significantly lower than that of the other two groups, but there was no significant difference in IL-18 secretion between the three groups in THP-1 macrophages and BMDMs.All three methods can successfully prepare MSU crystals, but the levels of inflammation induced by the crystals prepared by the three methods were not identical. The degree of inflammation induced by MSU crystals prepared by neutralization and alkalization is greater than by acid titration, but the quantity of MSU crystals obtained by the alkalization method is higher and less time-consuming. Apparently, the window of inflammation triggered by acid titration preparation is shorter compared to other forms of crystal preparation. Overall, MSU crystals prepared by the alkaline method should be recommended for studying the molecular mechanisms of gout in animal and cellular models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Many people with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) do not recover with current conventional management. Systematic reviews show multidimensional treatment improves pain better than usual active interventions. It is unclear whether multidimensional physiotherapy improves pain better than usual physiotherapy. This study determines the effectiveness of this treatment to reduce pain and disability and improve quality of life, pain cognitions, and electroencephalographic pattern in individuals with NSCLBP. Methods 70 eligible participants aged 18 to 50 years with NSCLBP were randomized into either the experimental group (multidimensional physiotherapy) or the active control group (usual physiotherapy). Pain intensity was measured as the primary outcome. Disability, quality of life, pain Catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, fear Avoidance Beliefs, active lumbar range of motion, and brain function were measured as secondary outcomes. The outcomes were measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 10, and 22 weeks. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat approaches. Results There were 17 men and 18 women in the experimental group (mean [SD] age, 34.57 [6.98] years) and 18 men and 17 women in the active control group (mean [SD] age, 35.94 [7.51] years). Multidimensional physiotherapy was not more effective than usual physiotherapy at reducing pain intensity at the end of treatment. At the 10 weeks and 22 weeks follow-up, there were statistically significant differences between multidimensional physiotherapy and usual physiotherapy (mean difference at 10 weeks, -1.54; 95% CI, -2.59 to -0.49 and mean difference at 22 weeks, -2.20; 95% CI, − 3.25 to − 1.15). The standardized mean difference and their 95% confidence intervals (Cohen’s d) revealed a large effect of pain at 22 weeks: (Cohen’s d, -0.89; 95% CI (-1.38 to-0.39)). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes. Conclusions In this randomized controlled trial, multidimensional physiotherapy resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvements in pain compared to usual physiotherapy in individuals with NSCLBP at 10 and 22 weeks.

The assessment of hand grip strength (HGS) in children and adolescents with JIA is of major importance, and the association of HGS with JIA disease activity, disability and quality of life has not been explored. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate hand grip strength (HGS) in children and adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) compared to matched healthy peers. The secondary objective was to explore the relationship between HGS and JIA disease activity, disability, and quality of life. This study involved 23 patients with JIA and 46 age and sex matched healthy controls. Hand held dynamometer was used to evaluate HGS for all study participants. Anthropometric parameters for all study participants were measured. Disease activity, physical function, and quality of life were assessed for the JIA group using juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS-27), juvenile arthritis functionality scale (JAFS), and pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) respectively. Laboratory marker of inflammation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and plain radiography of hands were performed for all patients. Hand grip strength of children and adolescents with JIA was significantly weaker compared to matched controls (p < 0.001). Hand grip strength had a significant inverse correlation with JADAS-27 (r = − 0.467, p = 0.025), JAFS (r = − 0.650, p = 0.001) and a significant direct correlation with PedsQL (r = 0.438, p = 0.036). In addition, HGS was negatively correlated with ESR and duration of morning stiffness (r = − 0.489, p = 0.018 and r = − 0.201, p = 0.359, respectively). HGS was detected as an independent predictor of disease activity, disability, and quality of life in JIA patients in multivariate linear regression. Assessment of HGS could be a simple non-invasive tool for assessing disease activity, disability and quality of life in JIA patients in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Adequate nutrition, including intake of dietary calcium and vitamin D, is important to maintain bone health. Evidence suggests that a deficiency in micronutrients may contribute to bone loss during aging and exert generalized effects on chronic inflammation. Recently, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was developed to assess the inflammatory potential of individual diets. Our aim was to evaluate the DII in a representative sample and verify its association with low-impact fractures.Individuals from The Brazilian Osteoporosis Study (BRAZOS) database had their DII calculated. BRAZOS is an important cross-sectional epidemiological study carried out with a representative sample of men and women ≥40 years old. The research was conducted through in-home interviews administered by a trained team. Nutrition Database System for Research (NDSR) software was used to analyze data on the intake of nutrients, which were employed to calculate the DII using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS®) and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS®) to assess its association with low-impact fractures.A total of 2269 subjects had their DII score calculated using information from 24-h recall data. Males had lower DII than females (DII = 1.12 ± 1.04 vs DII = 1.24 ± 0.99, p = 0.012). Women taking statins had lower DII (DII = 0.65 ± 1.14 vs DII + 1.26 ± 0.98, p = 0.002), indicating a greater potential for diet-related anti-inflammatory effects.Our findings suggest that women might have a pro-inflammatory diet pattern compared to men. However, we did not find any association between DII scores and low-impact fractures.",

Therefore, knowing the patient’s perception of their health status is of fundamental importance for understanding the real impact of PsA. Given this context, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recently developed the Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID) - instrument to specifically assess the impact of PsA for the patient. Objective Validate the brazilian portuguese version of PsAID-12 (Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease) and to verify its interpretability in clinical practice, through its relation with measures of psoriatic arthritis activity. Methods A multicenter cross-sectional study, which recruited 160 patients, who met the Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR), in six Brazilian centers of rheumatology. Reliability was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The construct validity was evaluated by exploratory factorial analysis and also by Spearman correlation with other PROMs and measures of disease activity evaluation. Results Of the total number of participants, 50% were female, with a mean age (SD) of 54.0 ± 11.2 years; 68% had only peripheral arthritis and 32% had pure or mixed axial involvement. The majority (67.7%) of the patients were using biological treatment. The reliability of internal consistency (alpha-Cronbach = 0.93) and test-retest (ICC = 0.996) were good. Factor analysis revealed two factors, named physical and psychosocial, which included the skin evaluation item. PsAID-12 correlated significantly with other PROMs, demonstrating good construct validity. PsAID-12 was also significantly associated with the disease activity assessment instruments (DAS28-ESR, ASDAS, and BASDAI) and the MDA status: “Minimum Disease Activity”. Fibromyalgia did not significantly affect the final PsAID-12 score. Conclusion The brazilian version of PsAID-12 has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of the impact of the disease in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Moreover, it associated significantly with the scores of disease activity assessment.",

Methods In this study, we first analyzed the expression of PLCL1 in the synovial tissue of RA patients and K/BxN mice by immunohistochemical staining. Then silencing or overexpressing PLCL1 in FLS before stimulating by TNF-α. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β and CXCL8 in FLS and supernatants were detected by Western Blot (WB), Real-Time Quantitative PCR and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. We used INF39 to specifically inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and detected the expression of NLRP3, Cleaved Caspase-1, IL-6 and IL-1β in FLS by WB. Result When PLCL1 was silenced, the level of IL-6, IL-1β and CXCL8 were down-regulated. When PLCL1 was overexpressed, the level of IL-6, IL-1β and CXCL8 were unregulated. The previous results demonstrated that the mechanism of PLCL1 regulating inflammation in FLS was related to NLRP3 inflammasomes. INF39 could counteract the release of inflammatory cytokines caused by overexpression of PLCL1. Conclusion Result showed that the function of PLCL1 in RA FLS might be related to the NLRP3 inflammasomes. We finally confirmed our hypothesis with the NLRP3 inhibitor INF39. Our results suggested that PLCL1 might promote the inflammatory response of RA FLS by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Arthritis Ultrasound Robot (ARTHUR) is an automated system for ultrasound scanning of the joints of both hands and wrists, with subsequent disease activity scoring using artificial intelligence. The objective was to describe the patient’s perspective of being examined by ARTHUR, compared to an ultrasound examination by a rheumatologist. Further, to register any safety issues with the use of ARTHUR. Methods Twenty-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had both hands and wrists examined by ultrasound, first by a rheumatologist and subsequently by ARTHUR. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were obtained after the examination by the rheumatologist and by ARTHUR. PROs regarding pain, discomfort and overall experience were collected, including willingness to be examined again by ARTHUR as part of future clinical follow-up. All ARTHUR examinations were observed for safety issues. Results There was no difference in pain or discomfort between the examination by a rheumatologist and by ARTHUR ( p = 0.29 and p = 0.20, respectively). The overall experience of ARTHUR was described as very good or good by 92% (n = 23), with no difference compared to the examination by the rheumatologist ( p = 0.50). All (n = 25) patients were willing to be examined by ARTHUR again, and 92% (n = 23) would accept ARTHUR as a regular part of their RA clinical follow up. No safety issues were registered. Conclusions Joint ultrasound examination by ARTHUR was safe and well-received, with no difference in PRO components compared to ultrasound examination by a rheumatologist. Fully automated systems for RA disease activity assessment could be important in future strategies for managing RA patients. Trial registration : The study was evaluated by the regional ethics committee (ID: S-20200145), which ruled it was not a clinical trial necessary for their approval. It was a quality assessment project, as there was no intervention to the patient. The study was hereafter submitted and registered to Odense University Hospital, Region of Southern Denmark as a quality assessment project and approved (ID: 20/55294).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To determine prevalence and factors associated with flares post Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). Methods A retrospective multi-centre study was conducted (January 2021 to February 2022). Data were collected during index visit, defined as first post-vaccine visit in which the patient had a physician-defined flare, or if at least 3 months had elapsed since first vaccine dose, whichever came first. Factors associated with flares were identified using mixed effects Cox regression and expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Total of 2377 patients were included (1563 RA, 415 PsA and 399 SpA). Among patients with RA, PsA and SpA, 21.3%, 24.1% and 21.8% experienced a flare respectively. Of those who experienced a flare, only 10.2%, 11.0% and 14.9% were severe in patients with RA, PsA and SpA respectively. Patients with low or moderate/high disease were more likely to flare compared to those in remission in patients with RA only (HR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.22–2.31; HR: 2.28, 95% CI 1.50–3.48, respectively). Receiving the Moderna vaccine was associated with a higher HR of flare compared to the Pfizer vaccine in patients with PsA only (HR: 2.21, 95% CI 1.20–4.08). Patients who had two vaccine doses were found to be less likely to flare (HR: 0.08, 95% CI 0.06–0.10). HRs of flares were not significantly different among RA, PsA and SpA. Conclusion About one-fifth of patients experienced a disease flare post COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, but most flares were non-severe. Patients with active disease prior to vaccination should be monitored closely for disease flares, especially in patients with RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Despite some knowledge gaps in scientific evidence, MgCl 2 is largely used for pain relief in musculoskeletal diseases. Mg salts were shown to provide analgesia postoperatively in orthopedic surgery and low Mg levels were linked to arthritis development and severity. We determined the anti-inflammatory activity of MgCl 2 in an acute arthritis model. Methods Mice received 0.1 mg/25µL Zymosan (Zy) or saline into the knees. Joint pain was evaluated using von Frey test; cell influx, and interleukin (IL)-1 level were assessed in joint lavage at 6 h. Synovia were excised for histopathology and analysis of immunoexpression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Groups (n = 6/group) received either 90 mg/kg MgCl 2 /100 µL or saline per os (systemic) or 500 µg/25 µL MgCl 2 or saline intra-articularly (i.a.) 30 min prior to Zy. Results MgCl 2 given either systemically or locally significantly reduced cell influx ( p = 0.0012 and p = 0.0269, respectively), pain ( p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0038, respectively), and intra-articular IL-1 level ( p = 0.0391), as compared to saline. Systemic MgCl 2 significantly decreased NFκB ( p &lt; 0.05) immmunoexpression, as compared to saline. Conclusion MgCl 2 given systemically or locally displayed anti-inflammatory activity in a severe acute arthritis model reducing cell influx, pain, and cytokine release. MgCl 2 operates at least partially via inhibiting NFκB activation. This is the first in vivo demonstration that MgCl 2 decreases cytokine release in arthritis, prompting reduction of inflammation and pain relief.",

The study aims to explore the clinical and demographic descriptors, treatment, and disease progression of enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) in comparison with juvenile-onset spondyloarthritis (SpA). Methods Cross-sectional analysis of consecutive patients in two dedicated clinics, with a single visit and retrospective case-notes review. Arthritis, enthesitis and sacroiliitis were evaluated by scoring disease activity and damage. Continuous variables were reported by median, interquartile range; categorical variables were reported by the frequency comparison of the two groups. Results Thirty-three cases were included, being 23 (69.7%) with ERA. The median age at diagnosis was 12.5 y (SpA) vs. 9 y (ERA) ( p &lt; 0.01); the time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 5.5 y (SpA) vs. 1.5 y (ERA) ( p &lt; 0.03). In both groups, the predominant presentation was a single joint or &lt; 5 lower limb joints and asymmetric involvement, with a high frequency of enthesitis. There was a higher frequency of mid-tarsal and ankle synovitis in the ERA group and hip involvement in those with SpA. The comparison of the frequency of spine symptoms at presentation, 30% SpA vs. 21.7% ERA ( p = 0.7), was not significant, and radiographic progression to spinal involvement occurred in 43.5% of ERA patients. The median time for spinal progression and age at onset was 2.2 and 12 y for ERA, and 4 and 16.5 y for SpA, respectively. Activity and damage scores were not significantly different between the groups. Treatment comparison resulted in 91.3% of ERA and 100% SpA being treated, predominantly with NSAIDs in both groups, followed by DMARDs and biologics, with a higher frequency of biologics in SpA. Conclusion The main differences were the late diagnoses of SpA, and the hip and spine involvement, with higher frequency of biologic treatment in juvenile-onset SpA compared to ERA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In 2021, an EULAR task force published a definition of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA). Our current knowledge of D2T RA with the EULAR definition is based on European and Asian cohorts, and no North American cohort has yet to be published. The aim of this study was to compare D2T RA patients to non-D2T RA who are good responders to advanced therapy, and to describe their evolution in an university health center patient cohort. Methods This is a retrospective single centre study of the medical records of all adults with RA on at least one biologic or target synthetic DMARD (b/tsDMARD). D2T RA group was defined according to the EULAR definition of D2T RA. The non-D2T RA group was defined as a b/tsDMARD good responder who had low-disease activity or remission for at least one year on 1 or 2 b/tsDMARD mechanism of action. We compared the patients’ comorbidities, and history of b/tsDMARD use. Descriptive statistics and proportions were calculated. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was used to estimate and compare median survival. Results Among the 417 patients, 101 (24%) were D2T RA and 316 (76%) were non-D2T RA. D2T RA group was slightly younger (63 ± 9 years versus 65 ± 12 years, p = 0.045), more likely to have concomitant non-inflammatory pain (28% versus 8%, p &lt; 0.0001) and to discontinue at least one b/tsDMARD due to intolerance (39% versus 10%, p &lt; 0.0001). In the D2T RA group, JAK inhibitors were associated with longer drug continuation when used as the third b/tsDMARD. Fewer patients were using corticosteroid at their most recent follow-up in this Canadian cohort compared to others (16% versus from 29 to 74%). Conclusion Concomitant non-inflammatory pain was more prevalent in D2T RA patients compared to b/tsDMARD good responder non-D2T RA patients. Steroid-sparing strategies is possible even in D2T RA patients. Future prospective research may compare JAK inhibitors with other mechanisms of action in D2T RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To evaluate the tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion in chronic inflammatory arthropathies (CIA) patients on TNFα inhibitors (TNFi) and without previous latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment. Methods Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with negative LTBI were retrospectively evaluated for TST conversion and active tuberculosis (TB) after six months of exposition to TNFi. Two groups were compared: patients who repeated TST ( TST-repetition ) during the follow-up and patients who did not ( non-TST-repetition ). Results A total of 355 CIA patients on TNFi were screened and 138 (38.9%) did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 217 CIA patients, 81 (37.3%) repeated TST during TNFi treatment. TST conversion rate was observed in 18 (22.2%) patients without significant differences among CIA ( p = 0.578). The number of TB cases was low ( n = 10; 4.6%) and was similar in TST-repetition and non-TST-repetition groups [2 (2.5%) vs. 8 (5.9%), p = 0.328]. Of note, 30% of active TB occurred early (6–12 months of TNFi exposure) and the median (full range) time to incident TB was 1.3 (0.6–10.6) years, whereas the median (full range) time to TST repetition was later [3.3 (0.5–13.4) years]. The incidence of active TB was lower among RA patients than AS patients [342 (95% CI 41 − 1446) vs. 1.454 (95% CI 594-2993)/100,000 patient-years, p = 0.049]. Conclusion These results indicate that TST repetition is associated with a high conversion rate, suggesting the need for recommended treatment. The delayed repetition of TST and low number of active TB cases hampered the evaluation of this strategy effectiveness to prevent active infection. Larger studies with systematic repetition patterns are necessary. In addition, the study highlights the need for a greater surveillance for TB in AS patients.",

No association of falls with age, disease duration, functional capacity, disease activity or physical performance was found. Patients with poorer performance in the physical tests had more functional impairment, higher disease activity and more advanced age. No differences in physical or functional performance, disease activity, gender or fear of falling were found between fallers and non-fallers; only a greater amount of medications used was found in the group of fallers. The occurrence of falls was high and associated with a previous history of falls and polypharmacy, with no association with disease activity or duration, functional capacity, physical performance, age or gender.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The V Brazilian Consensus for determination of autoantibodies against cellular constituents on HEp-2 cells, held in Brasilia (DF, Brazil) on August 27, 2016, discussed the harmonization between the Brazilian Consensus on ANA (BCA) guidelines and the International Consensus on ANA Patterns (ICAP) recommendations ( www.anapatterns.org ). Initial guidelines were formulated by the group of Brazilian experts with the purpose of guiding and enabling Brazilian clinical laboratories to adopt recommendations and to provide a common standard for national and international consensuses. Mainbody Twenty Brazilian researchers and experts from universities and clinical laboratories representing the various geographical regions of the country participated in the meeting. Three main topics were discussed, namely the harmonization between the BCA guidelines and latest recommendations of the ICAP initiative, the adjustment of the terminology and report on HEp-2 patterns, and a reassessment of quality assurance parameters. For the three topics, our aim was to establish specific guidelines. All recommendations were based on consensus among participants. There was concrete progress in the adjustment of the BCA guidelines to match the ICAP guidelines. To a certain extent, this derives from the fact that ICAP recommendations were largely based on the algorithm and recommendations of the IV Brazilian ANA Consensus, as consistently recognized in the ICAP publications and presentations. However, although there is great overlap between the two Consensuses, there are some point divergences. These specific items were individually and extensively discussed, and it was acknowledged that in several points ICAP improved recommendations previously issued by the Brazilian ANA Consensus and these changes were readily implemented. Regarding some specific topics, the BCA panel of experts felt that the previously issued recommendations remained relevant and possibly will require further discussion with ICAP. The term anti-cell antibodies was adopted as the recommended designation, recognizing that the assay addresses antibodies against antigens in the nucleus and in other cell compartments. However, the acronym ANA HEp-2 was maintained due to historical and regulatory reasons. It was also signalized that the latest trend in ICAP is to adopt the term Indirect Immunofluorescent Assay on HEp-2 cell substrate (HEp-2 IIFA). In addition, the quality assurance strategies previously presented were ratified and emphasized. Conclusion The V BCA edition was successful in establishing an overall harmonization with the ICAP recommendations for interpretation of the HEp-2 IIFA test, pinpointing the perspectives in filling the remaining gaps between both initiatives.",

Clinical characteristics of patients who developed a postsurgical gout flare were compared with those of patients who did not develop gout flare.Among 70 patients, 31 (44.3%) developed gout flare during the postsurgical period. Mean intervals from surgery to gout flare was 3.7 days. Flares tended to involve monoarticular joints (61.3%) and affect lower extremity joints (83.9%). Knee joints (26%) and foot joints except the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (26%) were more frequently involved than the first MTP joint (13%). Presurgical uric acid level ≥ 9 mg/dL (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.28-11.10, p = 0.016) and amount of uric acid changes between before and after surgery (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.21-2.18, p = 0.001) were risk factors for postsurgical gout flare. Taking allopurinol reduced the risk of postsurgical gout flare (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.45, p = 0.001). Operation time, amount of blood loss during surgery, and surgery site were not significantly associated with postsurgical gout flare.Adequate uric acid control before surgery could prevent the postsurgical gout flare.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Indian Takayasu Clinical Activity Score (ITAS2010) was developed in 2010 as an assessment tool for disease activity in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA). It has since been widely used in different studies and in clinical practice for the management of patients with TA. The present study aims to translate the ITAS2010 into Brazilian Portuguese language and to validate it for use in clinical practice in Brazil. Methods For this cross-sectional study, the ITAS2010 was translated in accordance with the guidelines described by Beaton et al. and then applied with 27 patients with TA on three assessments by two rheumatologists working independently. To measure interrater agreement, the assessments were performed on the same day within approximately 1 hour. One of the rheumatologists performed a second evaluation of patients with TA within 7 to 14 days to measure intrarater agreement. Results The correlation coefficient for the ITAS2010 score between the two raters was high ( r = 0.916; p &lt; 0.0001), as well as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [0.918 with a 95% confidence interval (95CI): 0.828–0.962]. The correlation coefficient and the ICC for intrarater agreement were moderate for ITAS2010 ( r = 0.633; p &lt; 0.0001 and ICC = 0.594; 95CI: 0.292–0.790). The ITAS2010 at baseline was compared with the physician’s global assessment (PGA) and with Kerr’s criteria for detecting disease activity in TA. Higher ITAS2010 scores were observed in patients with active and grumbling/persistent disease than in those presenting inactive disease according to the PGA [1.5 (0.0–3.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0–0.0); p = 0.0025]. Patients with active disease according to the Kerr’s criteria had also higher ITAS2010 scores than those considered in remission [3.0 (3.0–7.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0–0.0); p = 0.0068]. Conclusions The Brazilian Portuguese version of the ITAS2010 is a valid and reproducible tool for the assessment of disease activity in TA and it is an additional tool for the routine evaluation of Brazilian patients with TA.",

The objective of this study was to identify the frequency of, and risk factors for, MTX intolerance using the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score (MISS) questionnaire in patients with RA. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed between April 2018 and April 2019 and enrolled patients with RA in regular use of oral or subcutaneous MTX for at least 3 months. Patients were invited to answer the Brazilian Portuguese version of the MISS questionnaire, and MTX intolerance was defined by a score ≥ 6 points. Age, sex, disease duration, time of MTX use, dose, route of administration, concomitant medications, comorbidities, smoking, and Disease Activity Score for 28joint (DAS28) data were collected from institutional medical records. Results Among 120 patients, 103 (85.8%) were female, the mean age was 61 (±12.5) years, the mean duration of disease was 16 (±10.3) years, and the average duration of MTX use was 7 (±5.5) years. The frequency of MTX intolerance was 21.6%. The most frequent symptoms reported after the use of MTX were nausea (92.3%), abdominal pain (46.1%), and vomiting (30.7%). Behavioral symptoms occurred in 96.1% of patients with MTX intolerance, the most frequent being restlessness and irritability. Patients who used corticosteroids were more likely to develop MTX intolerance than those not using corticosteroids (odds ratio = 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.06; p = 0.038). Conversely, increasing age showed marginally significant association with decreased risk of MTX intolerance ( p = 0.059). Conclusions The use of the MISS questionnaire disclosed high frequencies of anticipatory, associative, and behavioral symptoms in MTX-intolerant patients, and the use of corticosteroid increases the risk of MTX intolerance. We suggest that the MISS questionnaire be used routinely in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Gout is characterized by inflammatory arthritis with hyperuricaemia and deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints. Several animal models have been proposed based on MSU crystals injection or high-fat diet feeding; however, neither hyperuricaemia model nor acute gout model can effectively reflect clinical features of gout. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a compound gout model induced by the combination of MSU crystals injection and high-fat diet feeding. Methods The compound gout model was induced by high-fat diet feeding per day and the intraplantar injection of MSU crystals (1 mg) into the footpad of each mouse every 10 days. Serum uric acid, foot swelling and pain analyses were performed at days 22, 32 and 42. Gout inflammation, serum proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota analyses were performed only at day 42. Results Compared to hyperuricaemia model or acute gout model, the compound gout model showed little advantages of elevating serum uric acid, causing foot swelling and gout inflammation, while it caused more severe serum inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Severe serum inflammation in the compound gout model could be reflected by the increased levels of IL-1α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, KC, MCP-1 and MIP-1β. In addition, the compound gout model induced more alterations in the gut microbiota, including increasing levels of Desulfovibrio and Parasutterella . Conclusion The injection of MSU and feed of high-fat diet have a combined effect on elevating serum inflammation and causing gut microbiota disorders in the process of establishing a gout model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disorder due to mutations in the GLA gene resulting in defective enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. FD patients are frequently misdiagnosed, commonly for rheumatic diseases. Determining pathogenicity of a mutation depends of in silico predictions but mostly on available clinical information and interpretation may change in light of evolving knowledge. Similar signs and symptoms in carriers of GLA gene genetic variants of unknown significance or of benign variants may hamper diagnosis. This study reviews rheumatic and immune-mediated manifestations in a cohort of Brazilian FD patients with classic mutations and also in subjects with GLA gene A143T and R118C mutations. Misdiagnoses, time to correct diagnosis or determination of GLA gene status, time to treatment initiation and reasons for treatment prescription in A143T and R118C subjects are reviewed. Methods Genotype confirmed classic FD patients ( n = 37) and subjects with GLA gene mutations A143T and R118C ( n = 19) were referred for assessment. Subjects with R118C and A143T mutations had been previously identified during screening procedures at hemodialysis units. All patients were interviewed and examined by a rheumatologist with previous knowledge of disease and/or mutation status. A structured tool developed by the authors was used to cover all aspects of FD and of common rheumatic conditions. All available laboratory and imaging data were reviewed. Results Thirty-seven consecutive FD patients were interviewed – 16 male / 21 female (mean age: 43.1 years) and 19 consecutive subjects with GLA gene mutations R118C and A143T were evaluated – 8 male / 11 female (mean age: 39.6 years); 15 [R118C] / 4 [A143T]. Misdiagnosis in FD patients occurred in 11 males (68.8%) and 13 females (61.9%) of which 10 males and 9 females were previously diagnosed with one or more rheumatic conditions, most frequently rheumatic fever or “rheumatism” (unspecified rheumatic disorder). Median time for diagnosis after symptom onset was 16 years (range, 0–52 years). Twenty-two patients were treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) – 13 male and 9 female. Median time to ERT initiation after FD diagnosis was 0.5 years (range, 0–15 years). Rheumatic manifestations occurred in 68.4% of R118C and A143T subjects. Two subjects had been prescribed ERT because of renal disease [R118C] and neuropsychiatric symptoms [A143T]. Conclusion Misdiagnoses occurred in 64.8% of FD patients, most frequently for rheumatic conditions. Median time for correct diagnosis was 16 years. Rheumatic manifestations are also frequent in subjects with GLA gene R118C and A143T mutations. These results reinforce the need to raise awareness and increase knowledge about Fabry disease among physicians, notably rheumatologists, who definitely have a role in identifying patients and determining disease burden. Decision to start treatment should consider expert opinion and follow local guidelines.",

    "abstract": "As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread rapidly, there are still many unresolved questions of how this virus would impact on autoimmune inflammatory joint diseases and autoinflammatory disorders. The main aim of this paper is to describe the main studies focusing their attention on COVID-19 incidence and outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondylarthritis (SpA), and autoinflammatory disease cohorts. We also revised possible pathogenic mechanisms associated with. Available data suggest that, in patients with RA and SpA, the immunosuppressive therapy, older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbidities (hypertension, lung disease, diabetes, CVD, and chronic renal insufficiency/end-stage renal disease) could be associated with an increased risk of infections and high rate of hospitalization. Other studies have shown that lower odds of hospitalization were associated with bDMARD or tsDMARDs monotherapy, driven largely by anti-TNF therapies. For autoinflammatory diseases, considering the possibility that COVID-19 could be associated with a cytokine storm syndrome, the question of the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients displaying innate immunity disorders has been raised. In this context, data are very scarce and studies available did not clarify if having an autoinflammatory disorder could be or not a risk factor to develop a more severe COVID-19. Taking together these observations, further studies are likely to be needed to fully characterize these specific patient groups and associated SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Methods A total of 196 patients were consecutively included. Feet and ankles were evaluated in all patients by single-source DECT scan. The 2015 EULAR/ACR criteria were used as the reference for the diagnosis of gout. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DECT for the diagnosis of gout in the early (≤1 year), middle (1–3 years), and late (&gt; 3 years) disease durations were calculated. Besides, a novel semi-quantitative DECT scoring system was assessed for the measurement of urate deposition, and the correlation between the scores and the clinical and serological data were also evaluated. Moreover, the influences of artifacts on the diagnostic performance of DECT were also determined. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of DECT in 196 patients were 38.10, 96.43%, and 0.673 in the early-stage group; 62.96, 100.00%, and 0.815 in the middle-stage group; and 77.55, 87.50%, and 0.825 in the late-stage group, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracies in the AUC of DECT (Discovery CT750HD and Revolution CT) in the middle and late stages of gout were higher than that in the early stage of gout. Besides, the monosodium urate crystals were deposited on the first metatarsophalangeal joints and ankles/midfeet. Age, the presence of tophus, bone erosion, and disease duration considerably affected the total urate score. No statistical difference in the positive detection of nail artifact, skin artifact, vascular calcification, and noise artifact was found between the case and control groups. Conclusion DECT (Discovery CT750HD and Revolution CT) showed promising diagnostic accuracy for the detection of urate crystal deposition in gout but had limited diagnostic sensitivity for short-stage gout. Longer disease duration, the presence of tophus, and bone erosion were associated with the urate crystal score system. The artifacts do not remarkably affect the diagnostic performance of DECT in gout.",

The activity of SLE was evaluated with the modified sle disease activity index (sledai-2k).Impairment in at least one cognitive domain was found in 35 (87.2%) patients. The most compromised domains were attention (64.1%), memory (46.2%), and executive functions (38.5%). Patients with cognitive impairment were older, had more accumulated damage and had worse socioeconomic status. Regarding the association between cognitive dysfunction and HRQL, memory impairment was correlated with worse environmental perception and a worse relationship with the treatment.In this study, the frequency of CD in cSLE patients was as high as that in the adult SLE population.

Methods Forty-one psoriatic arthritis patients (18 to 65 years old) were randomized into two groups: functional training group and resistance exercise group. The functional training group underwent functional exercises with elastic band and the functional training group underwent machine resistance exercise twice a week for 12 weeks. Outcome measures were: The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Health Assessment Questionnaire for the Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) for functional capacity and functional status, one-repetition maximum test for muscle strength, the Short Form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) for quality of life, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28) for disease activity. Analyzes were performed by a blinded evaluator at baseline (T0), six (T6) and twelve (T12) weeks after the beginning of the exercise. Results At baseline, the groups were homogeneous in the clinical and demographic characteristics. There was a statistical intra-group improvement for both groups in the BASFI, BASDAI, HAQ-s, and DAS-28. In the quality-of-life assessment, both groups showed statistical intra-group improvements for all domains except the “emotional aspect” domain in the resistance exercise group. In the muscle strength, there was a statistical improvement for all exercises in both groups, except for the “alternate biceps (bilateral)” exercise. Conclusion Functional training and resistance exercise are similarly effective in improving functional capacity, functional status, disease activity, general quality of life, and muscle strength in patients with psoriatic arthritis.

    "abstract": "Currently, there are only few studies (mostly case reports or case series) on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies (SAM). Therefore, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MMF (monotherapy or coadjuvant drug) in a specific sample of patients with refractory SAM: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, anti-synthetase syndrome or clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis. A case series including 20 consecutive adult patients with refractory SAM from 2010 to 2016 was conducted. After the introduction of MMF, associated or not with other drugs, the patients were followed for 6 consecutive months. In 17 out of 20 patients MMF was introduced without any intolerance. The clinical symptoms evaluated in these patients were muscular, cutaneous and/or pulmonary activity. During the 6-month follow-up, 11 out of 17 patients had clinical and laboratory activities response with MMF, allowing significant tapering of the prednisone median dose (15 vs. 5 mg/day, P=0.005). On the other hand, in three out of 20 patients; MMF was discontinued in less than two months, because of gastrointestinal intolerance. There were no cases of serious infection or death. MMF was relatively well-tolerated, safe and effective in patients with refractory SAM. Further studies are needed to confirm the data found.",

Statistical analysis was performed using Bonferroni correction (p < 0.0022).DAH was observed in 19/847 (2.2%) cSLE patients. Cough/dyspnea/tachycardia/hypoxemia occurred in all cSLE patients with DAH. Concomitant parameters of severity observed were: mechanical ventilation in 14/19 (74%), hemoptysis 12/19 (63%), macrophage activation syndrome 2/19 (10%) and death 9/19 (47%). Further analysis of cSLE patients at DAH diagnosis compared to 76 cSLE control patients without DAH with same disease duration [3 (1-151) vs. 4 (1-151) months, p = 0.335], showed higher frequencies of constitutional involvement (74% vs. 10%, p < 0.0001), serositis (63% vs. 6%, p < 0.0001) and sepsis (53% vs. 9%, p < 0.0001) in the DAH group. The median of disease activity score(SLEDAI-2 K) was significantly higher in cSLE patients with DAH [18 (5-40) vs. 6 (0-44), p < 0.0001]. The frequencies of thrombocytopenia (53% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), intravenous methylprednisolone (95% vs. 16%, p < 0.0001) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (47% vs. 8%, p < 0.0001) were also significantly higher in DAH patients.This was the first study to demonstrate that DAH, although not a disease activity score descriptor, occurred in the context of significant moderate/severe cSLE flare. Importantly, we identified that this condition was associated with serious disease flare complicated by sepsis with high mortality rate.",

Demographic, clinical parameters, disease activity by ASDAS remission (< 1.3) and inactive/low (< 2.1) were analyzed to characterize reasons for drug survival and switching of anti-TNF. Among 117 AS patients, 69 (59%) were prescribed only one anti-TNF, 48 (41%) switched to a second anti-TNF and 13 (11%) to a third anti-TNF. Considering ASDAS-CRP < 1.3, 31 (39%) patients were inactive at the end of the study. Non-switchers (P = 0.04), younger age (P = 0.004), non-smoking (P = 0.016), shorter disease duration (P = 0.047), more frequent use of SSZ (P = 0.037) and lower BASDAI (P = 0.027), BASMI (P = 0.034) and BASFI (P = 0.003) at baseline were associated with remission. In the multivariate analysis younger age (P = 0.016) and lower BASDAI (P = 0.032) remained as remission predictors. This study supports that ASDAS-CRP remission is an achievable goal not only for non-switchers but also for second anti-TNF, particularly in patients with younger age and lower BASDAI at baseline. Co-medication and non-smoker status seems to have a beneficial effect in anti-TNF response in this population.",

Seventeen patients (19.5%) had anti-Mi-2 and 70 (80.5%) did not have this autoantibody. The following parameters were equally distributed between the patients with versus without anti-Mi-2: mean age at the disease diagnosis onset, median follow-up time, constitutional symptoms (baseline), cutaneous cumulative lesions, dysphagia, joint and pulmonary involvement. There was also no difference between the groups in relation to follow-up time, disease relapsing, treatment, disease status, deaths and occurrence of neoplasia. In contrast, patients with anti-Mi2 antibodies had higher frequency of elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes at disease onset (median: creatine phosphokinase 6240 [3800–9148] U/L and aldolase 60.0 [35.0–138.0] U/L), lower frequency of pulmonary involvement at disease onset (5.9%), less current glucocorticoid dose (median: 0 [0–10] mg/day), and higher frequency of disease remission during follow-up (58.8%) in comparison with patients without anti-Mi-2 autoantibody (484 [115–4880] and 12.1 [6.3–70.0] U/L, 40.0%, 0 [0–10] mg/day, 27.1%, respectively).

In published systematic reviews, there is no agreement about which drug is more effective and safer. This study aimed to compare evidence of the efficacy and safety of duloxetine compared with amitriptyline in the treatment of adult patients with fibromyalgia. This work contributes to guiding clinicians on the use of duloxetine or amitriptyline for the treatment of fibromyalgia and provides information for public health decision-makers. Methods Overview of systematic reviews of clinical trials comparing duloxetine and amitriptyline in the treatment of fibromyalgia. The reviews were screened in Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, and SRDR with no restrictions on language and year of publication, considering that the research was conducted in July 2018 and updated until May 2020. The selection was based on the following criteria: adult patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia treated with duloxetine or amitriptyline, comparing the efficacy and safety in pain, fatigue, sleep, and mood disorder symptoms and quality of life, in addition to the acceptability of these antidepressants. The methodological quality and strength of evidence were assessed using the AMSTAR and GRADE instruments. Results Eight systematic reviews were selected. Amitriptyline had low evidence for pain, moderate evidence for sleep and fatigue, and high evidence for quality of life. Duloxetine had high quality of evidence in patients with mood disorders. With low evidence, duloxetine has higher acceptability, but is safer in older patients, while amitriptyline is safer for non-elderly individuals. Conclusion Both antidepressants are effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia, differing according to the patient’s symptoms and profile. Registration PROSPERO: CRD42019116101.",

Methods The clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and treatment plans of 121 patients with SLE flare were retrospectively analyzed. Ninety-eight SLE outpatients with sustained remission during the same period were selected as controls. Logistic multivariate regression analysis was employed to screen for risk factors for SLE flare. Results Infection, thrombocytopenia, arthritis, anti-nucleosome antibodies positive, anti-β2-glycoprotein I (IgG) antibodies positive, and patient’s self-discontinuation of medicine maintenance therapy might be risk factors for SLE flare. Patients who discontinued medicine maintenance therapy by themselves had a significantly higher rate of severe SLE flare than patients with regular medicine maintenance therapy ( P = 0.033). The incidence of anemia associated with SLE ( P = 0.001), serositis ( P = 0.005), and pulmonary hypertension ( P = 0.003) in patients who discontinued medicine maintenance therapy were significantly higher than patients with regular medicine maintenance therapy. SLE patients with regular medicine maintenance therapy for less than 3 years had a higher risk of pulmonary hypertension than those with regular medicine maintenance therapy longer than 3 years ( P = 0.034). Conclusions The accompanying thrombocytopenia, arthritis, anti-nucleosome antibodies positive and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (IgG) antibodies positive at the onset of SLE may affect the prognosis of SLE. Patient’s self-discontinuation of medicine maintenance therapy is the main cause of SLE flare, which may induce severe flare in SLE patients and lead to a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Most of the few studies that have established reference ranges for serum uric acid (SUA) have not taken into account factors which may interfere with its levels and followed rigorous laboratory quality standards. The aim of this study was to establish reference ranges for SUA and determine the prevalence of hyperuricemia. Method Cross-sectional study including 15,100 participants ( all sample ) aged 35 to 74 years from baseline data of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), a multicentric cohort of volunteer civil servants from five universities and one research institute located in different regions of Brazil. It was established a reference sample excluding participants with factors that directly influence SUA levels: glomerular filtration rate lower than 60 ml/min, excessive alcohol intake, use of diuretics, aspirin, estrogen or urate-lowering therapy. SUA was measured using the uricase method and following rigorous international quality standards. Reference ranges were defined as values between percentiles 2.5 (P2.5) and 97.5 (P97.5) of SUA distribution in the reference sample , stratified by sex. Hyperuricemia was defined as SUA ≥ 7 mg/100 ml in the all sample. Results The reference sample was composed of 10,340 individuals (55.3% women, median age 50 years). Reference ranges (P2.5 to P97.5) for SUA were: 4.0 to 9.2 mg/100 ml for men and 2.8 to 6.9 mg/100 ml for women. Sex was a major determinant for SUA levels (median [IQR], mg/100 ml: 6.1 [5.3–7.0] for men versus 4.5 [3.9–5.3] for women, p &lt; 0.001). Higher levels of SUA were found in patients with higher BMI. Higher age had (a modest) influence only for women. The prevalence of hyperuricemia for all sample (N = 15,100) was 31.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.8–33.0%) in men and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3–5.3%) in women. Conclusion SUA reference ranges were 4.0 to 9.2 mg/100 ml for men and 2.8 to 6.9 mg/100 ml for women. Prevalence of hyperuricemia was 31.9% in men and 4.8% in women. Updated SUA reference ranges and prevalence of hyperuricemia are higher nowadays and might be used to guide laboratories and the screening for diseases related to SUA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction In chronic arthropathies, there are several mechanisms of joint destruction. In recent years, studies have reported the implication of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the process of activation and differentiation of osteoclasts, a key cell in the development of bone erosion. The RANKL/OPG ratio is increased in the serum of patients with malignant diseases and lytic bone disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to measure and compare the concentrations of OPG and RANKL in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis (SpA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Methods This was an observational and cross-sectional study with 83 patients, 33 with RA, 32 with SpA and 18 with OA, followed up regularly in the outpatient clinics of the Rheumatology Department of the Clinics Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School-USP. All patients were assessed for indications for arthrocentesis by the attending physicians at the time of SF collection and were evaluated for demographic variables and medication use. Disease activity was assessed in individuals with RA and SpA. The quantification of SF OPG and RANKL levels was performed by ELISA, and the correlations of the results with clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were assessed. Results We found no statistically significant difference in the RANKL and OPG levels among the groups. Patients with RA showed a positive correlation between the SF cell count and RANKL level (r = 0.59; p &lt; 0.05) and the RANKL/OPG ratio (r = 0.55; p &lt; 0.05). Patients with OA showed a strong correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the RANKL/OPG ratio (r = 0.82; p &lt; 0.05). There was no correlation between the OPG and RANKL levels and markers of inflammatory activity or the disease activity index in patients with RA or SpA. Conclusion Within this patient cohort, the RANKL/OPG ratio was correlated with the SF cell count in patients with RA and with serum CRP in patients with OA, which may suggest a relationship with active inflammation and more destructive joint disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Currently, only a few studies have described the general characteristics of patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) who tested negatives for anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. We aimed to further investigate the clinical characteristics of these patients in a large sample. Methods Data from patients with pSS who were treated at a tertiary hospital in China between 2013 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics of the patients were compared between those with and without anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibody negativity. Factors associated with anti-SSA and anti-SSB negativity were identified by logistic regression analysis. Results Overall, 934 patients with pSS were included in this study, among whom 299 (32.0%) tested negative for anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. Compared with patients testing positive for anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies, that testing negative for the two antibodies had a lower proportion of females (75.3% vs. 90.6%, p &lt; 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (6.7% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.002), but a higher proportion of abnormal Schirmer I tests (96.0% vs. 89.1%, p = 0.001) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) (59.2% vs. 28.8%, p = 0.001). Anti-SSA and anti-SSB negativity was positively associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 3.31), abnormal Schirmer I tests (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.24, 6.53), and ILD (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.67, 3.85). However, it was negatively related to thrombocytopenia (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.95). Conclusion Approximately one third of pSS patients had anti-SSA and anti-SSB negativity. pSS patients testing negative for anti-SSA and anti-SSB showed a higher risk of abnormal Schirmer I tests and ILD, but a lower risk of thrombocytopenia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background and objective Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an immune-mediated rheumatic disease characterized by fibrosis and vascular lesions. Interstitial lung disease is an early complication of SSc and the main cause of death from SSc. Although baricitinib shows good efficacy in a variety of connective tissue diseases, its role in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is unclear. The objective of our study was to explore the effect and mechanism of baricitinib in SSc-ILD. Methods We explored crosstalk between the JAK2 and TGF-β1 pathways. In vivo experiments, SSc-ILD mice model were constructed by subcutaneous injection of PBS or bleomycin (7.5 mg/kg) and intragastric administration of 0.5% CMC-Na or baricitinib (5 mg/kg) once every two days. We used ELISA, qRT‒PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining to evaluate the degree of fibrosis. In vitro experiments, we used TGF-β1 and baricitinib to stimulate human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFLs) and assessed protein expression by western blot. Results The vivo experiments showed that baricitinib notably alleviated skin and lung fibrosis, decreased the concentration of pro-inflammatory factors and increased those of the anti-inflammatory factors. Baricitinib affected the expression of TGF-β1 and TβRI/II inhibitiing JAK2. In the vitro experiments, following the culture of HFLs with baricitinib or a STAT3 inhibitor for 48 h, the expression levels of TβRI/II decreased. Conversely, with successful inhibition of TGF-β receptors in HFLs, JAK2 protein expression decreased. Conclusions Baricitinib attenuated bleomycin-induced skin and lung fibrosis in SSc-ILD mice model by targeting JAK2 and regulating of the crosstalk between the JAK2 and TGF-β1 signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Our aim was to compare the efficacy of rituximab, tocilizumab, and abatacept in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to treatments with MTX or TNFi agents. Methods We searched 6 databases until January 2023 for phase 2–4 RCTs evaluating patients with RA refractory to MTX or TNFi therapy treated with rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab (intervention arm) compared to controls. Study data were independently assessed by two investigators. The primary outcome was considered as achieving ACR70 response. Results The meta-analysis included 19 RCTs, with 7,835 patients and a mean study duration of 1.2 years. Hazard ratios for achieving an ACR70 response at six months were not different among the bDMARDs, however, we found high heterogeneity. Three factors showing a critical imbalance among the bDMARD classes were identified: baseline HAQ score, study duration, and frequency of TNFi treatment in control arm. Multivariate meta-regression adjusted to these three factors were conducted for the relative risk (RR) for ACR70. Thus, heterogeneity was attenuated (I2 = 24%) and the explanatory power of the model increased (R2 = 85%). In this model, rituximab did not modify the chance of achieving an ACR70 response compared to abatacept (RR = 1.773, 95%CI 0.113–10.21, p = 0.765). In contrast, abatacept was associated with RR = 2.217 (95%CI 1.554–3.161, p &lt; 0.001) for ACR70 compared to tocilizumab. Conclusion We found high heterogeneity among studies comparing rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab. On multivariate metaregressions, if the conditions of the RCTs were similar, we estimate that abatacept could increase the chance of reaching an ACR70 response by 2.2-fold compared to tocilizumab.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that systemic metabolic abnormalities are closely related to psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and indirect bilirubin (IBIL), two essential active substances in hepatic metabolism that have been demonstrated as an oxidative and anti-oxidative factor respectively, have been proved to be involved in oxidative stress damage and inflammation in several human diseases. However, their role in PsA remains unclear.In this retrospective comparative cohort study, a case group of 68 PsA patients and a control group of 73 healthy volunteers from the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University were enrolled. Serum GGT, IBIL, GGT/IBIL ratio and C-reactive protein (CRP), a well applied bio-marker of systemic inflammatory in PsA, were compared between the two groups. Furthermore, the relationship of GGT, IBIL and GGT/IBIL with CRP were explored in PsA patients. Finally, the patients were divided into high inflammation group and low inflammation group according to the median value of CRP. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used for the association of systemic inflammation level with GGT, IBIL and GGT/IBIL.Compared with healthy controls, PsA patients exhibited significantly higher serum GGT, GGT/IBIL, and CRP levels and lower IBIL levels. Serum GGT and GGT/IBIL were positively correlated with CRP, whereas IBIL were negatively correlated with CRP. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that serum GGT was a risk factor for high CRP in PsA, whereas IBIL was a protective factor. Furthermore, GGT/IBIL was a better indicator of high CRP condition in PsA patients than either GGT or IBIL alone, as determined by the receiver operating characteristic curves.GGT and IBIL may participate in the pathogenesis of PsA. Additionally, GGT, IBIL and the balance of the two may reflect systemic inflammation mediated by oxidative stress events related to metabolic abnormalities to a certain extent.",

Methods A cross-sectional study of medication requests for the treatment of PsA was carried out between November 2014 and December 2016. Linear regression was used to verify the factors associated with time to delivery. Results A total of 218 cases containing 250 drugs were analyzed. The median time between the medical appointment and the first dispensation was 66 days (interquartile range, 44–90). The State proceedings, which includes requesting the drug until the authorization of treatment, was the stage that most contributed to the total time spent. The factors associated with the longer time to delivery of medications were prescriptions coming from clinics and specialty centers, from dermatologists, non-authorized processes and non-persistent patients in the treatment in 12 months. Conclusion The median time to receive medicines for the PsA treatment in Belo Horizonte health region after a medical prescription was higher than 2 months.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 is a generic instrument to assess disability. Pain and psychological factors seem to play a pronounced disabling role in fibromyalgia (FM). There are few studies that investigate the factors associated with disability in patients with fibromyalgia from the patient’s perspective. Information about FM disability using self-reported questionnaires is limited. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the ordinal response variable (degree of disability), and four explanatory variables: pain intensity, depression, anxiety, and alexithymia. Methods One hundred fifteen women with FM were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. For the assessment of disability the WHODAS 2.0 (36-item version) was used. Univariate and multivariate (ordinal logistic regression) analyses were performed to assess the relationship between pain (Visual Analogue Scale), depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), alexithymia (Modified Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and disability. Results Disability was detected by global WHODAS score in 114 patients (99%), with the corresponding percentages for mild, moderate and severe disability being 11.3, 46.96 and 40.87%, respectively. Global WHODAS score was more severe among subjects with depression (50 vs 36.4, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 0.33) and alexithymia (50 vs 33.6, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 0.38). Pain intensity mean scores for mild, moderate and severe disability were 5.0, 6.1 and 7.3, respectively ( p &lt; 0.001, omega-squared = 0.12). Pain intensity explained the global disability degree and its domains except for the cognitive one. Whereas, depression explained cognitive and personal relation domains. On the other hand, alexithymia explained global disability degree and all domains of WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire. Conclusions Most of the patients with fibromyalgia perceived themselves with moderate to severe disability. The main explanatory variables of the perceived disability were the pain intensity and psychological factors (alexithymia and depression).",

Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis who were using a biologic exclusively dispensed by Unified Public System were included. Storage temperature was measured by digital thermometer inserted into the refrigerator of the participant's home. Fisher's exact test was performed to cross-reference the temperature data and the qualitative variables obtained using an epidemiologic questionnaire. Mean, minimum, maximum values and standard deviation were described in the quantitative data. Mann-Whitney non-parametric test was performed to the association between temperature excursion and the number of people in the house.A total of 81 participants were included and 67 (82.71%) did not maintain home storage correctly. The maximum temperature observed among all patients was 15.5 °C, the minimum was - 4.4 °C and the average was 5.6 °C (standard deviation 2.8); 10 (12.3%) had at least one negative temperature measured. The average time for participants who had an inadequate temperature record was 8 h and 31 min. Nine participants (90%) who stored the medication into the shelf/drawer below the freezer had a temperature excursion (p = 0.011). Most of the participants (88.5%) who stored their biopharmaceutical near the back side, close to the wall of the refrigerator had a negative temperature record (p < 0.001).Most of the study participants (82.71%) did not maintain adequate home storage conditions for their biopharmaceutical. Intrinsic factors of household refrigerators may be involved in temperature deviations.",

There is little research in that sense and in consequence, interventions designed to improve this area. The objectives of this study are 1) to gain knowledge about the needs of adolescents with JIA, particularly focused on their friendships; 2) to explore the potential of the Internet to help them, and 3) to determine what kind of online resource would be the best and what elements it should include. Methods To achieve the proposed objectives we designed a qualitative study including two phases: the first one exploratory (semi-structured interviews) and the following, confirmatory (online focus group). Results 14 adolescents were interviewed and 7 participated in the focus group. They reported some social challenges related to their illness: feeling different, criticized by peers, or not believed. Additionally, they specified some of the coping strategies they used, such as disclosing to others that they have JIA, using communication skills, maintaining activities with friends, trying to minimize pain, and ignoring negative comments. Adolescents considered an online resource useful and mentioned that they would like to find general information and to have the possibility to interact with others. They considered Instagram and WhatsApp as good platforms to implement the online resource. Conclusions According to their perceptions, adolescents with JIA can benefit from an online resource which delivers information, strategies and facilitates interaction with others.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The reproducibility and reliability of the modified Rodnan’s Skin Score (mRSS) are debated due to investigator-related subjectivity. Here, we evaluate if durometry correlates with mRSS in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2018 to June 2019, including 58 diffuse SSc patients. Two certified researchers, blind to each other’s scores, performed the mRSS, followed by durometry at 17 predefined skin sites. For durometry and mRSS, individual scores per skin site were registered. Durometry and mRSS results measured by each researcher, as well as scores from different researchers, were compared. Skin thickness measurements from forearm skin biopsies were available in a subset of the patients, for comparisons. Statistical analyses included Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, Kendall’s Coefficient and Spearman’s test. Results Mean (standard deviation, SD) patient age was 44.8 (12.9) years, and 88% were female. Inter-rater agreement varied from 0.88 to 0.99 (Intraclass correlation coefficient) for durometry, and 0.54 to 0.79 (Cohen’s Kappa coefficient) for mRSS, according to the specific evaluated sites. When data were compared with skin thickness assessed in forearm biopsies, durometry correlated better with skin thickness than mRSS. Conclusion Durometry may be considered as an alternative method to quantify skin involvement in patients with diffuse SSc. The strong inter-rater agreement suggests that the method may be useful for the assessment of patients by multiple researchers, as in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic disease characterized by autoimmunity, vasculopathy, and visceral and cutaneous fibrosis. Vitamin D has several functions in the immunological system, and different studies have suggested a potential role in triggering autoimmune diseases. Patients with SSc may present with low serum levels of vitamin D, but the association between hypovitaminosis D and disease onset or any clinical manifestation is still obscure. Our goal was to verify the causal relationship between hypovitaminosis D and SSc onset or any particular clinical manifestation in the literature. Methods A systematic literature review was performed through February 24th, 2021 on Pubmed, Lilacs/BIREME, and Cochrane databases. The eligible studies were read in full text, and, in the absence of exclusion criteria, were included in this review after consensus between two reviewers. Results Forty articles met the eligibility criteria and the main results of each study are described. In most studies, SSc patients showed a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency compared to controls. Additionally, in some reports serum levels of vitamin D were inversely correlated with the severity of SSc. Oral supplementation did not seem to affect serum levels of vitamin D. Four of the included studies were with experimental models. Conclusion In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency seems to have a role in susceptibility to SSc, as well as in the clinical manifestations of the disease.",

Early recognition of this condition can provide early and effective treatment and prevent structural impairment. This study aims to identify nail ultrasonographic characteristics in three groups: psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and controls patients, to determine if the ultrasonography (US) can identify early signs of nail psoriatic impairment or local inflammation. We conducted nail US to determine nail matrix resistance index (NMRI), nail bed resistance index (NBRI), and power Doppler (PD) and grayscale (GS) parameters in these 3 groups.Single-center, cross-sectional study. GS, PD, and spectral doppler images of bilateral 2nd and 3rd fingernails were acquired from 35 PsO, 31 PsA, and 35 controls patients. An US equipment with an 18 MHz linear transducer for GS and 8.0 MHz for PD was used. PD, NMRI, NBRI, nail plate thickness (NPT), nail bed thickness (NBT), nail matrix thickness (NMT), and morphostructural characteristics of the trilaminar structure (TS) were evaluated in saved images, blind.Mean NMRI and NBRI did not differ between groups. Linear regression analysis detected no relationships between PsO or PsA and NMRI or NBRI. Nail PD grade did not differ between groups. Type I and IV TS changes were more frequent in PsO; types II and III changes were more frequent in PsA (p < 0.001). NPT was greater in PsA and PsO groups than controls: PsA 0.73 ± 0.14 mm, PsO 0.72 ± 0.15 mm, Controls 0.67 ± 0.10 mm (p = 0.001).Echographic TS characteristics of the nail plate and NPT evaluated by GS are useful and can distinguish PsO and PsA nails from controls.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Lupus nephritis (LN) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with 10–25% of patients progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objective This study aims to elucidate the predictive capabilities of 24-h proteinuria (24PTU) and serum creatinine (sCr) after 12 months of treatment with respect to long-term renal outcomes in LN in a single-center cohort of LN patients. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 214 patients diagnosed with LN followed in our center. Values of 24PTU and sCr were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months, and after 5 years and/or the last evaluation. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for 3 months or longer. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) was defined as the need for permanent dialysis. Receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC) were used to test the best cut-off value of 24PTU and sCr at 12 months who predict bad long-term renal outcomes. Results The mean follow-up period was 11.2 ± 7.2 years. The best cut-off values for 24PTU and sCr as predictor of CKD were, respectively, 0.9 g/24 h and 0.9 mg/dL. ROC curve for 24PTU had a slightly lower performance than ROC curve for sCr as predictor for CKD (PTU AUC = 0.68; sCr AUC = 0.70), but sensitivity and specificity were better for 24PTU (24PTU: sensitivity = 63.5%, specificity = 71.2%; sCr: sensitivity = 54.8%, specificity = 75.3%). When the outcome was ESRD the best cut-off points were 0.9 g/24hs and 1.3 mg/dL for 24PTU and sCr, respectively, and the curve performance was better for 24PTU (PTU AUC = 0.72; sCr AUC = 0.61). Conclusions In this ethnically diverse population with LN followed for a long time (&gt; 10 years), levels of 24PTU &gt; 0.9/day at 12 months was a good predictor of bad long-term renal outcome. The serum creatinine &gt; 0.9 mg/dL and &gt; 1.3 mg/dL at 12 months were also good predictors of CKD and ESRD, respectively. Patients with 24PTU &lt; 0.9 g/day and sCr &lt; 1.3 mg/dL at 12 months are not likely to develop ESRD because of the high negative predictive values (NPV) (93.2% and 82%). 24PTU and sCr are relevant as components for a treat-to-target strategy for LN treatment, since their high NPV corroborates their importance as good predictors of long-term renal outcome .",

Our objective was to describe the characteristics of patients among the Brazilian population. Methods A multicenter retrospective study was conducted with the participation of five pediatric rheumatology centers in Brazil during the period from March to November 2020. Children and adolescents with PIMS temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (TS) who met the definition criteria for the disease according to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, therapeutic characteristics and molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were described. Results Fifty-seven children and adolescents with PIMS-TS were evaluated, 54% female, with a median age of 8 (3–11) years. Most (86%) were previously healthy, with asthma being the main comorbidity, present in 10% of the patients. Fever was the main manifestation, present in all patients, followed by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal features, present in 89% and 81% of the patients, respectively. Myocarditis occurred in 21% of the patients and in 68% of them required intensive care. The Kawasaki disease phenotype occurred in most patients (77%). All patients had elevated inflammatory markers, with elevated CRP being the most found (98%). Anemia and lymphopenia were present in 79% and 72%, respectively. Laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 77% of the patients, with 39% positive RT-PCR and 84% positive serology for SARS-CoV-2. An immunomodulatory treatment was performed in 91% of the patients, with 67% receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) associated with glucocorticoid, 21% receiving IVIG, and 3.5% receiving glucocorticoid. The median length of hospitalization was 10 days. Conclusions This study showed a high morbidity of PIMS-TS in Brazilian children, with a prolonged length of hospitalization and a high rate of admission to pediatric intensive care unit. Multicenter prospective studies are needed to assess the morbidity of the disease in the medium and long term.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) generates an inflammatory profile that predisposes to total and visceral fatty accumulation and reduced fat free mass (FFM). This metabolic disorder contributes to poor functionality, increased cardiovascular risk and higher mortality. This study aimed to address a systematic review with meta-analysis to determine the effect of biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs and tsDMARDs) on body composition (BC) of patients with RA. Methods The search was conducted at the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Lilacs and grey literature. This investigation was carried until July 2021. Outcomes of interest were total weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM) and FFM. A meta-analysis comparing these outcomes in RA patients under bDMARD treatment versus controls was performed. Results Out of 137 studies reviewed, 18 were selected: fifteen prospective cohorts, two retrospective cohorts, and one cross-sectional study. The studies comprised 1221 patients, 778 on bDMARD treatment and 443 controls, which included RA patients under conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD). No study addressing BC analysis in patients using tsDMARD was found. The mean age and duration of the disease was 56.7 years and 6.77 years, respectively. Ten studies demonstrated a significant increase of total weight in 88.2% of patients and 42.3% for BMI. In studies that analyzed BC by double X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the increase in total weight and BMI correlated positively to the increase in FFM. The meta-analysis carried out in five studies showed no significant difference of the mean difference for total weight 0.12 kg (95% CI − 5.58, 5.82), BMI 0.08 kg/m 2 (95% CI − 1.76, 1.92), FM − 0.08 kg (95% IC − 5.31, 5.14), and FFM − 2.08 kg (95% CI − 7.37, 3.21). Conclusion This systematic review suggests a possible impact of bDMARDs on BC of RA patients, even though, the meta-analysis carried out in a small part of these studies was not able to confirm significant variation in BC components.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) is a risk factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the production of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) in RA patients. Our objective was to examine the real-world effectiveness of abatacept versus tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in patients with RA who were SE and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP3) positive. Methods Abatacept or TNFi initiators who were SE + and anti-CCP3+ (&gt; 20 U/mL) at or prior to treatment and had moderate or high CDAI score (&gt; 10) at initiation were identified. The primary outcome was mean change in CDAI score over six months. Analyses were conducted in propensity score (PS)-trimmed and -matched populations overall and a biologic-experienced subgroup. Mixed-effects models were used. Results In the overall PS-trimmed (abatacept, n = 170; TNFi, n = 157) and PS-matched cohorts (abatacept, n = 111; TNFi, n = 111), there were numerically greater improvements in mean change in CDAI between abatacept and TNFi but were not statistically significant. Similar trends were seen for biologic-experienced patients, except that statistical significance was reached for mean change in CDAI in the PS-trimmed cohort (abatacept, 12.22 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) 10.13 to 14.31]; TNFi, 9.28 [95%CI 7.08 to 11.48]; p = 0.045). Conclusion In this real world cohort, there were numerical improvements in efficacy outcomes with abatacept over TNFi in patients with RA who were SE + and ACPA+, similar to results from a clinical trial population The only statistically significant finding after adjusting for covariates was greater improvement in CDAI with abatacept versus TNFi in the bio-experienced PS-trimmed cohort..",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite their rarity, Lyme disease and Whipple’s disease are of significant importance in rheumatology, as both can manifest as chronic arthritis, presenting challenges in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathies. In Lyme disease, arthritis typically emerges as a late manifestation, usually occurring six months after the onset of erythema migrans. The predominant presentation involves mono- or oligoarthritis of large joints, with a chronic or remitting-recurrent course. Even with appropriate antimicrobial treatment, arthritis may persist due to inadequate immunological control triggered by the disease. In contrast, Whipple’s disease may present with a migratory and intermittent seronegative poly- or oligoarthritis of large joints, preceding classic gastrointestinal symptoms by several years. Both disorders, particularly Whipple’s disease, can be misdiagnosed as more common autoimmune rheumatic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. Epidemiology is crucial in suspecting and diagnosing Lyme disease, as the condition is transmitted by ticks prevalent in specific areas of the United States, Europe, and Asia. On the contrary, the causative agent of Whipple’s disease is widespread in the environment, yet invasive disease is rare and likely dependent on host genetic factors. In addition to erythema migrans in Lyme disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in Whipple’s disease, neurological and cardiac involvement can further complicate the course of both. This article offers a comprehensive review of the epidemiological, pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of both diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction If a large amount of urate crystals is deposited in a joint cavity for an extended period of time, bone erosion will occur and gradually cause skeletal muscle necrosis and joint deformity. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and factors associated with bone erosion in gout patients with tophi. Methods A total of 210 gout patients with tophi were enrolled and divided into a bone erosion group (n = 135) and a non-bone erosion group (n = 75). Digital radiography (DR) was performed to detect bone erosion in the elbow, wrist, knee, ankle joints, interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. The clinical characteristics were recorded and compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the factors associated with bone erosion. Results Compared with the non-bone erosion group, the bone erosion group had an older age, longer disease duration of gout and tophi, higher level of serum creatinine (sCr), higher proportion of drinking history and ulceration, and a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Univariate logistic regression analysis results showed that sex, age, body mass index (BMI), gout duration, tophi duration, GFR, white blood cell (WBC) count, sCr level, smoking history, drinking history, and presence of ulceration were associated with bone destruction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis results indicated that tophi duration, drinking history, ulceration and sCr were positively and independently related to bone erosion. Conclusions Tophi patients with bone erosion presented different clinical characteristics. Tophi duration, drinking history, ulceration and sCr were associated with bone erosion in gout patients with tophi.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Psoriatic arthritis (PA) is a chronic inflammatory systemic arthritis that can result in loss of functional capacity and joint deformation. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness and safety of biological and target synthetic drugs for treating PA. Methods We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of Adalimumab, Etanercept, Infliximab, Golimumab, Secukinumab, Certolizumab Pegol and Tofacitinib in the main general databases and clinical trial registers databases. The primary outcomes were ACR 50, PsARC, and serious adverse events. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction. Network meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model and frequentist approach. The CINeMA software was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Results We included 33 RCTs (n = 11,034). The results from the network meta-analysis for the ACR 50 at 6-months follow-up showed that all drugs were superior to placebo, with Secukinumab (high certainty of evidence), Infliximab (very low certainty of evidence) and Adalimumab (high certainty of evidence) ranking the highest. Regarding the PsARC (at 6-months follow-up), all drugs, except for Golimumab (very low certainty of evidence), were superior to placebo, with Etanercept (low certainty of evidence), Infliximab (low certainty of evidence) and Certolizumab Pegol (low certainty of evidence) being the most effective drugs. There were no significant differences in the risk of serious adverse events between the drugs and placebo. Golimumab (very low certainty of evidence), Secukinumab (low certainty of evidence), and Adalimumab (very low certainty of evidence) ranked the highest for safety. Conclusions In conclusion, based on the balance between efficacy and safety, Secukinumab and Adalimumab may be the preferred options among the evaluated drugs for treating patients with PsA. However, caution is necessary when interpreting the safety findings, as they are supported by evidence of low to very low certainty. Consequently, the balance between benefits and potential risks may change as new safety evaluation studies become available. Protocol registration PROSPERO: CRD42022315577",

Objective To analyze the occurrence of serious infections and the associated factors in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis patients under real-life conditions. Methods We analyzed data from the REAL, a prospective observational study, that evaluated Brazilian RA patients, with clinical and laboratory data collected over a year. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed from the adjustment of the logistic regression model Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), with the primary outcome being the occurrence of serious infection, defined as need for hospitalization or use of intravenous antibiotics for its treatment. Results 841 patients were included with an average follow-up time of 11.2 months (SD 2.4). Eighty-nine serious infections occurred, corresponding to 13 infections per 100 patient-years. Pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and central nervous system disease increased the chances of serious infection by 3.2 times (95% CI: 1.5–6.9), 3.6 times (95% CI: 1.2–10.4) and 2.4 times (95% CI: 1.2–5.0), respectively. The use of corticosteroids in moderate doses increased the chances by 5.4 times (95% CI: 2.3–12.4), and for each increase of 1 unit in the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the chance increased 60% (95% CI: 20–120%). Conclusion The use of corticosteroids at moderate doses increased the risk of serious infection in RA patients. Reduced functionality assessed by the HAQ and comorbidities were other important factors associated with serious infection in this cohort.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are involved in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis through pro-inflammatory cytokine production. TAK-242, a TLR4 blocker, has been found to have a significant impact on the gene expression profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1-β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TLR4, as well as the phosphorylation of Ikβα, a regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, in OA-FLSs. This study aims to investigate this effect because TLR4 plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses. Materials and methods Ten OA patients’ synovial tissues were acquired, and isolated FLSs were cultured in DMEM in order to assess the effectiveness of TAK-242. The treated FLSs with TAK-242 and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were analyzed for the mRNA expression level of IL1-β, IL-6, TNF-α , and TLR4 levels by Real-Time PCR. Besides, we used western blot to assess the protein levels of Ikβα and pIkβα. Results The results represented that TAK-242 effectively suppressed the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines IL1-β , IL-6 , TNF-α , and TLR4 which were overexpressed upon LPS treatment. Additionally, TAK-242 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikβα which was increased by LPS treatment. Conclusion According to our results, TAK-242 shows promising inhibitory effects on TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses in OA-FLSs by targeting the NF-κB pathway. TLR4 inhibitors, such as TAK-242, may be useful therapeutic agents to reduce inflammation and its associated complications in OA patients, since traditional and biological treatments may not be adequate for all of them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Amyloidosis is a localized or systemic disease caused by deposition of proteins in the extracellular space of various organs and tissues. As part of the disease, proteins that were originally soluble misfold and acquire a fibrillar conformation that renders them insoluble and resistant to proteolysis. Systemic amyloidosis is a rare, often underdiagnosed condition. In recent years, the incidence of newly diagnosed cases of amyloidosis has been increasing in association with the aging of the population and greater access to diagnostic tests. From a clinical perspective, systemic amyloidosis is frequently associated with involvement of the kidneys (causing nephrotic syndrome), heart (cardiac failure and arrhythmia), and peripheral nervous system (sensorimotor polyneuropathy and autonomic dysfunction). This condition is important to the rheumatologist for several reasons, such as its systemic involvement that mimics autoimmune rheumatic diseases, its musculoskeletal manifestations, which when recognized can allow the diagnosis of amyloidosis, and also because reactive or secondary AA amyloidosis is a complication of rheumatic inflammatory diseases. The treatment of amyloidosis depends on the type of amyloid protein involved. Early recognition of this rare disease is fundamental for improved clinical outcomes.",

An OA animal model was established and after OA induction, rats received intra-articular injections of lentivirus twice a week for four weeks. Rats were divided into four groups: control (healthy rats without OA), OA model (rats with induced OA), OA + Len-si-NC (OA rats treated with a non-targeting control lentivirus), and OA + Len-si-Hck (OA rats treated with lentivirus targeting Hck). Blood samples were collected, and serum cytokine levels were measured using ELISA. Afterward, the rats were sacrificed for histological analysis and TUNEL assay. In vitro, IL-1β-treated human chondrocytes were transfected with Hck, and the effects on cell viability, apoptosis, ECM degradation, and JAK-STAT3 signaling were assessed. Colivelin, a JAK-STAT3 agonist, was used to confirm the pathway’s involvement. Results indicated increased Hck expression in the cartilage tissues of OA rats and in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. Silencing Hck i n vivo reduced IL-6 and TNF-α levels, apoptosis, and preserved cartilage structure. In vitro, Hck knockdown in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes resulted in enhanced cell viability, reduced apoptosis, and decreased ECM degradation. Notably, the expression of MMP3 and MMP13 was significantly lowered, while collagen II and aggrecan levels were restored. Additionally, Hck knockdown inhibited JAK-STAT3 activation, which was evident from reduced levels of phosphorylated JAK1 and STAT3. The addition of colivelin reversed these effects, confirming that Hck mediates its effects through the JAK-STAT3 pathway. Overall, our findings indicate that Hck is critical in OA progression by promoting inflammation, apoptosis, and ECM degradation through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway activation.",

The main CMV sites involved were lung (45.5%), bone marrow (40.9%) and gut (27.3%). Mortality rate was 45.5%, especially in those with higher doses of daily oral corticosteroids (107 ± 55.4 mg vs. 71.7 ± 46.3 mg; p = 0.07) and lower number of lymphocytes (309 ± 368.2/mm3 vs. 821 ± 692.9/mm3; p = 0.06). Our data showed high incidence of CMV-Ag in AIRD patients, particularly those with SLE and greater disease severity. In addition, it was observed high mortality in these patients, highlighting the CMV infection should be included in differential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a granulomatous necrotizing vasculitis with high morbidity and mortality. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is a valuable diagnostic marker, however its titer lacks predictive value for the severity of organ involvement. Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) has been regarded as a potential marker in assessing systemic inflammation. We aimed to explore the value of PLR and MPV in the assessment of disease activity and manifestations of disease in GPA. Methods 56 newly diagnosed GPA patients and 53 age-sex matched healthy controls were included in this retrospective and cross-sectional study with comparative group. Complete blood count was performed with Backman Coulter automatic analyzer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) with Westergen method and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with nephelometry. The PLR was calculated as the ratio of platelet and lymphocyte counts. Result Compared to control group, ESR, CRP and PLR were significantly higher and MPV significantly lower in GPA patients. In patients group, PLR was positively correlated with ESR and CRP ( r = 0.39, p = 0.005 and r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). MPV was negatively correlated with ESR and CRP ( r = − 0.31, p = 0.028 and r = − 0.34 p = 0.014, respectively). Patients with renal involvement had significantly higher PLR than patients without renal involvement (median:265.98, IQR:208.79 vs median:180.34 IQR:129.37, p = 0.02). PLR was negatively correlated with glomerular filtration rate ( r = − 0.27, p = 0.009). A cut-off level of 204 for PLR had 65.6% sensitivity and 62.5 specificity to predict renal involvement. Conclusion PLR exhibit favorable diagnostic performance in predicting renal involvement in patients with GPA.",

Disease activity parameters including SLEDAI-2 K scores and major organ involvement at onset and follow up, with accrued damage scored by SLICC-DI, during last follow up, were compared with those without kidney involvement. Autoantibodies, renal function and complement tests were determined by standard methods. Subjects were grouped by presence or absence of ELN. Results Out of the 846 subjects enrolled, mean age 11.6 (SD 3.6) years; 427 (50.5%) had ELN.

The aim of this study was to investigate the validity and reliability of Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS-TR) in Turkish FMS patients. Methods FMS patients who met the 2016 fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria were included in the study. Clinical and demographic data of the patients were noted. The relationship between this scale and other functional parameters such as Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), European Quality of Life Scale-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was examined. Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used to evaluate the functional status of the patients and the progression of the disease. Test-retest reliability was calculated by re-applying the questionnaire to patients at 2-week intervals. Duloxetine treatment was initiated in newly diagnosed patients and sensitivity to change was tested at the end of the treatment. Spearman correlation coefficient was used. P &lt; 0.05 was accepted as significant. Results Eighty-one FMS patients (71 females, 10 males) were included in the study. The mean age was 44.2 ± 10.7 years. The strongest correlation of JSS-TR was with another sleep questionnaire, PSQI (rho = 0.79, p &lt; 0.0005). The correlation with other functional parameters and FIQ was moderate. In test-retest validity, intraclass correlation coefficient was found to be 0.98 ( p &lt; 0.0005). Chronbach α value calculated for internal consistency was found to be 0.741. Conclusions JSS-TR is a valid, simple and feasible sleep instrument that can be easily applied to FMS patients both in researches and clinical settings.",

Methods We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for published studies on SSc-associated PH from inception to May 2021. All cohort studies in which mortality and/or survival for SSc-associated PH were reported were included in the analysis. The outcome parameters were pooled and analyzed using a random-effects model via generic inverse-variance weighting in conventional and cumulative meta-analysis. Results The literature search identified 1161 citations, and the full texts of 54 studies were examined. Sixteen articles, with a total of 7857 patients with SSc and 1140 patients with SSc-associated PH, were included in the meta-analysis. Patients with SSc-associated PH had a higher pooled risk of mortality than patients with SSc without PH (risk ratio = 3.12; 95% confidence interval: [2.44, 3.98]). Conclusions This meta-analysis revealed a higher mortality in patients with SSc-associated PH. PH was a significant predictor of death in patients with SSc.

Their understanding is justified in physiological, psychological, and sociocultural terms on the basis of the differential morbidity and mortality associated with a chronic disease that begins in childhood and prevails into adulthood. Materials and methods Here, we reflect on the history, structure, and impact of transition clinics in pediatrics, with an emphasis on pediatric rheumatologic diseases. Additionally, we propose comprehensive reflection as an alternative for the patient, their family, and the medical team, outlining guidelines for development, implementation, and evaluation. Results The transition of care should commence in early adolescence, considering each patient’s cognitive ability as a condition for the initiation of an educational process involving introspection into the disease. Interdisciplinarity is defined as a team that addresses the clinical, physical, emotional, and social dimensions of each patient and their interaction with the environment within the framework of individualized care and family support. Despite this, the lack of evidence supporting standardized guidelines for the implementation and overall effectiveness evaluation of these interventions was highlighted. Conclusions The transition process is considered successful when the patient is adherent and has a positive and informed perception of their health‒disease journey. We urge the generation of evidence documenting the comprehensiveness of processes inherent to transition clinics as the foundation of necessity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The clinical manifestations and course of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) exhibits considerable heterogeneity. In this study, we aimed to explore radiographic progression over a defined period, employing the Warrick score as a semi-quantitative measure in early RA-ILD, and to assess the associated risk factors for progression. Methods RA-ILD patients underwent consecutive Warrick scoring based on initial high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) at diagnosis and the first follow-up. Associations between Warrick scores, pulmonary function tests, and patient characteristics were analyzed. The ROC curve assessed the predictive performance of the Warrick score change rate for ILD progression, while multivariable logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for progression. Results Significant correlations were found between Warrick scores and age at RA-ILD diagnosis, age at ILD diagnosis, and baseline DAS28-ESR. For the severity score, correlations were r = 0.359, r = 0.372, and r = 0.298 ( p = 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.014, respectively); for the extent score, r = 0.364, r = 0.318, and r = 0.255 ( p = 0.001, p = 0.005, p = 0.038, respectively); and for the total score, r = 0.376, r = 0.367, and r = 0.280 ( p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.022, respectively). Annual changes in severity, extent, and total Warrick scores showed sensitivities of 91–97% and specificities of 98% for predicting progression over a 5-year follow-up. Cut-off values were 0.0278 for the severity score (AUC 0.954), 0.0227 for extent score (AUC 0.976), and 0.0694 for total score (AUC 0.946). Warrick severity, extent, and total scores increased significantly during follow-up. Age &gt; 50 years (OR 7.7; p = 0.028) and baseline usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern (OR 3.1, p = 0.041) were identified as risk factors for progression. Conclusions Advanced age and UIP pattern were significant risk factors for progression. Warrick scoring may may help predict progression in RA-ILD, particularly through changes in severity, extent, and total scores. Due to the retrospective design and small sample size, further prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and validate Warrick scoring as a reliable marker for RA-ILD progression.",

We aimed to analyze the prevalence patterns of comorbidities and disease-related complications of RA patients enrolled in Colombia's contributory healthcare regime. We performed a nationwide observational descriptive cross-sectional study using administrative claims data. We used a set of sensitive and specific electronic algorithms (i.e., a set of rules) applied to linked data based on ICD-10 codes and unique medication use codes. We compared all those algorithms with several sources, including governmental agencies and scientific literature, to identify all the known adults treated for RA. A total of 123,080 RA cases for 2018 were identified, corresponding to a point prevalence of 0.86 (95% CI 0.86–0.87) per 100.

This parallel, three-arm randomized controlled trial, conducted between 2022 and 2023, included 59 knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients randomly allocated to one of three groups: the first group received 40 µg/mL ozone therapy, the second group received 20 µg/mL ozone therapy, and the control group received oxygen. Functional mobility was assessed through the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), knee flexion range of motion (FROM), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the pain subscale of the WOMAC. Intra-articular injections were administered weekly for four consecutive weeks, with assessments conducted pre-treatment, and at two weeks, one month, and two months post-intervention. One-way ANOVA was employed for normally distributed quantitative data, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized for non-normally distributed data. Qualitative variables were analyzed using the Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The groups receiving intra-articular ozone therapy exhibited notable reductions in mean VAS scores and improvement in functional mobility variables when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). However, post-hoc analysis indicated no statistically significant differences between the 40 µg/mL and 20 µg/mL ozone therapy groups regarding these parameters (VAS, FROM, TUG, 6MWT, or WOMAC scores) (p > 0.05).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The risk of tuberculosis infection (TBI) and its progression to tuberculosis disease (TBD) among persons with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) results from a complex interplay of patient and disease characteristics, immunosuppression level, and the epidemiological context. Brazilian recommendations are unclear about TBI screening and its preventive treatment (TPT) in persons with IMID. Objective To provide a comprehensive and evidence-based guideline for managing TBI in persons with IMID in Brazil. Methods This task force was constituded by 42 specialists with interest in IMID and TBD. A core leadership team (CLT) drafted fourteen clinical questions on the risk of tuberculosis and indications of TPT among persons with IMID who started, or are about to start immunosuppressive drugs. The CLT supervised the systematic reviews and formulated the recommendations. The experts voted using the Delphi Method. Results Nine recommendations were established. More than 80% of panelists voted “agree” and “strongly agree” with all statements. In brief, all persons with IMID starting or about to start immunosuppressive treatment should undergo tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), a chest imaging test and investigation of contact with active pulmonary or laryngeal TBD. TPT is mandatory for those with any positive result after excluding TBD. Exceptions include individuals with a history of TBD or a past positive TBI infection test. IGRA is preferred only in persons BCG-vaccinated in the past 2 years. Those with inconclusive IGRA results can have the test repeated once, and TPT should be offered if it remains indeterminate. TST or IGRA should be repeated yearly, for three years, when the previous test was negative, when starting or changing to a different class of immunosuppressive drug. Overall, the included studies had a low quality of evidence and high risk of bias. Conclusions These guidelines are meant to improve the management of TBI in IMID. Health professionals must consider the epidemiological risk, host features, the social scenario, the characteristics of the disease, the access to health resources, and the development of an individualized plan for every patient.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 15 participants per group completed the study protocol. Results All groups showed significant intragroup improvements over time in pain, function, muscle strength, and quality of life. However, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups for any of the assessed outcomes. The bodily pain domain of the SF-36 and analgesic consumption were the only measures showing differences over time. Conclusion The combination of IAI-TH and a 12-week PREP (twice weekly) was not superior to IAI-SS or placebo combined with the same PREP in improving pain, function, or quality of life in elderly patients with knee OA. These findings highlight the role of exercise as a key therapeutic strategy, regardless of prior IAI. Future studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-ups are needed to better assess the role of intra-articular corticosteroid injections in OA rehabilitation.

    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder that can cause generalized inflammation and is characterized by fibrosis of the skin, organs, and vasculopathy. Limited SSc is more common and typically associated with a milder disease course, whereas diffuse SSc, although less common, is linked to a higher mortality rate due to more frequent visceral organ involvement. One of the most common complications of SSc is interstitial lung disease (ILD). ILD is characterized by fibrosis, scarring, and inflammation of the lungs. ILD has a 30% prevalence and a 40% 10-year mortality in patients with SSc worldwide. Hospitalizations for SSc from 2002 to 2020 were obtained using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), an all-payer administrative database that captures 97% of hospital discharges in the United States. The primary aim was to evaluate whether inpatient mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospital cost differed if SSc patients had underlying ILD. We estimated multivariable logistic regression and log-normal models controlling for age, biological sex, race/ethnicity, income, and hospital setting. ILD was associated with 88% greater adjusted odds of inpatient mortality (aOR 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.31, p < 0.001), 15% longer stays (aOR 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.28, p = 0.001), and 33% higher adjusted hospital costs (aOR 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.40, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that SSc-ILD has a significant impact on hospitalization outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The article \"Brazilian Recommendations for the Management of Tuberculosis Infection in Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases\" by Viviane de Souza et al. presents important discussions on the subject; however, the recommendation for annual repetition of the TST/IGRA test for three years and after medication changes raises considerable concerns. This approach may lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Frequent false-positive results in retests can result in unnecessary antibiotic use, contributing to bacterial resistance, a problem of global significance. The recommendation, considered to have a moderate level of evidence, is subject to criticism. Arguments used to support retesting, such as high conversion rates of tests after one year, reports of tuberculosis cases despite negative screenings being attributed to false negatives, and reliance on other sources with lower levels of evidence, do not constitute sufficient evidence to confirm tuberculosis infection or justify the recommendation. On the other hand, there is evidence that has not been considered in the discussion against the recommendation for retesting, indicating that this practice may increase the risk of diagnosing false-positive infections, leading to overtreatment without clinically proven benefits. Potentially harmful interventions should not be implemented without solid evidence to support them. In this letter to the editor, we briefly discuss this recommendation and the arguments against its implementation, highlighting its associated risks.",

In recent years, total cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden scores have had substantial value in predicting cognitive impairment. However, its application in treating concurrent cognitive impairment in SLE patients is unclear. To explore the relationship between total CSVD burden scores and cognitive dysfunction in SLE patients and to analyze its predictive value. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was used to evaluate the cognitive function of 50 patients with SLE, and the total load score of patients with CSVD was analyzed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multivariate regression was used to evaluate the relationship between total CSVD burden scores and cognitive dysfunction, and the predictive value of total CSVD burden scores was assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that years of education (OR = 0.975, 95% CI [0.952-0.998], P = 0.035), neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) (OR = 4.152, 95% CI [2.158-7.990], P < 0.001), and the CSVD total burden score (OR = 3.884, 95% CI [0.840-0.928], P < 0.001) were independently associated with cognitive impairment in SLE patients. The results of the ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the CSVD total burden score for the prediction of cognitive impairment in SLE patients was 0.885. Years of education, NPSLE score, and total CSVD burden score are closely related to the occurrence of cognitive impairment in SLE patients. In particular, the total CSVD burden score is beneficial for the prediction of cognitive impairment. Not applicable. Not applicable.",

Methods The prevalence of MetS was assessed cross-sectionally in 58 patients with cSLE and 33 age -matched controls. Information was collected by clinical examination and standardized questionnaires, investigating personal and family history of cardiovascular disease and obesity and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Results The prevalence of MetS was higher in cSLE patients than in controls according to both ABRAN criteria (8.6% vs. 0%; p = 0.083) and IDF criteria (10,3% vs. 3.0%; p = 0.208), but without statistical significance. Importantly, 91.4% of patients were from a low-income household. Patients with MetS according to ABRAN also had lower ESR levels ( p = 0.039), higher total cholesterol ( p = 0.013), HDL-c ( p = 0.007) and triglycerides ( p = 0.001) and a lower albumin level ( p = 0.016). Patients with MetS according to IDF had higher SDI scores ( p = 0.039) and higher C3 and C4 levels ( p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The multivariate logistic regression identified higher levels C4 (OR = 32.6; 95% CI = 1.0-544.0; p = 0.015) and increase in the number of leukocytes (OR = 1.9, 95%CI = 1.1–3.2; p = 0.022) as independent risk factors for MetS in patients with cSLE. Conclusion The prevalence of Mets in the patients with cSLE seems to be low in this population. There was association of MetS with higher cumulative damage indices and levels of complement. We did not observe any association with clinical manifestations, autoantibody profile and dose of corticosteroids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Systemic sclerosis (SSc) often leads to decreased muscle strength and mass, impairing physical performance and causing disability. Interventions with resistance exercise (RE) is an effective non-pharmacological approach to mitigate these issues. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of interventions with RE on muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance, physical disability, and quality of life (QOL) in SSc patients, as well as to assess its adherence and safety. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on a PICOS framework: Patient = Systemic Sclerosis; Intervention = Resistance exercise; Study design = Randomized clinical trials. Searches were performed across MEDLINE (PubMed), PMC, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and EMBASE up to January 2025. Results Ten randomized clinical trials, including 422 participants (~85% female), were eligible for analysis. Participants’ ages ranged from 42 to 64 years, with body mass indices between 22.5 and 28.0 kg/m 2 . The intervention period was standardized to 12 weeks. Interventions with RE significantly improved muscle strength (SMD = 2.76 kg; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.20; p = 0.0002) and functional disability (SMD = −0.47; 95% CI, −0.93 to −0.00; p = 0.05) compared to controls. Interventions with RE also showed superiority in the physical component of QOL (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.81; p = 0.03). Although enhanced physical performance was observed, statistical pooling was not possible due to limited data. Interventions with RE had a low incidence of adverse events, but data on disease progression and adherence were insufficient. Conclusion Interventions with RE benefits muscle strength, physical function, and QOL in SSc patients, though optimal protocols and adherence strategies need further investigation. More robust studies are required to refine training methods and enhance clinical trial designs.",

To characterize patients with SjD from the Brazilian Sjögren's Disease Registry (BRAS) who developed hematological and solid neoplasms, analyzing the organ primarily involved, subtypes, occurrence of metastatic disease, timing of diagnosis and correlation with demographic, serologic aspects, and labial salivary gland inflammation. Among consecutive patients included in the Brazilian Sjögren's Disease Registry (BRAS) and fulfilling the 2002 or 2016 classification criteria for SjD, those who developed neoplasia were retrospectively identified and categorized according to the National Cancer Institute (Ministry of Health, Brazil). RESULTS: 1,010 patients were included; of them, 975 were women (96.5%), with an average age of 55.6 ± 13.6 years. Disease duration was 11.9 ± 7.9 years. We found that 114 out of 1,010 patients (11.3%) had cancer, with a higher prevalence in those over 55 years old (p < 0.001). The most prevalent malignancies were skin cancer [24/858 (2.7%)], breast cancer [27/1010 (2.6%)], lymphoma [15/1010 (1.5%)], and thyroid cancer [8/1010 (0.8%)]. Further, 0.9% of patients had more than one type of cancer. Cancer diagnosis followed SjD diagnosis in 66.7% of lymphoma cases, 53.6% of other malignancies, and 75.0% of skin cancer. The presence of cancer was associated with age (OR 1.04). In the case of skin cancer, the duration of SjD was an additional risk factor (OR 1.08). For thyroid cancer, inflammation of the labial minor salivary glands was identified as an associated risk factor (OR 10.1). Other types of cancer were more prevalent than lymphoma in our population of SjD patients. Breast neoplasia emerged as the most prevalent after skin cancer, and thyroid cancer was the second most prevalent solid neoplasia.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chikungunya fever (CF) is marked by acute, subacute, and chronic phases, with a significant proportion of patients experiencing persistent joint and neuropathic pain. These symptoms may mimic those of rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). There is currently no consensus on whether the infection directly causes chronic joint disease or serves as an immunological trigger for the development of rheumatic conditions. Aim This study aims to evaluate the overall proportion of CF patients who progress to chronic arthropathy, and to identify how many of these patients meet the classification criteria for RA and SpA (including ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)). Methods A thorough search was conducted in electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of chronic arthropathy, defined as joint signs and symptoms lasting more than six weeks following the acute phase of CF. The secondary endpoint involved the proportion of patients meeting the classification criteria for RA, SpA, AS, and PsA. A random-effects meta-analysis model was utilized to combine studies and determine the pooled frequency of persistent joint symptoms. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the fulfillment of classification criteria for rheumatic diseases. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211430). Results A total of thirty-eight studies, comprising data from 12.524 individuals with CF published between 2008 and 2022, met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 4.324 (34.5%) patients developed chronic arthropathy; among them, 11.43% (240 in 2099) patients met the criteria for RA, 12.1% (86 in 711) patients for SpA, 3.42% (36 in 1052) patients for AS, and 2.05% (25 in 1220) patients for PsA. Conclusion This study found that approximately one-third of CF patients experience persistent joint pain lasting over six weeks. However, only a minority of these individuals meet classification criteria for rheumatic diseases.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a new scoring system for predicting recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This was a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Patients with APS were followed up from APS diagnosis to either recurrent thrombosis or their last follow-up date, whichever came first. A multivariable logistic regression analysis with a backward elimination was used to develop a new scoring system, incorporating conventional cardiovascular risk factors and antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profile as covariates. Each covariate remaining in the final step was multiplied by its β coefficient, rounded to the nearest integer, and then summed. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for medication use, assessed the association between the new scoring system and recurrent thrombosis risk. The accuracy of the new scoring system in predicting recurrent thrombosis was evaluated by estimating the area under the curve (AUC) and comparing it with the adjusted global APS score (aGAPSS). A total of 126 patients with APS were included. The median age of the cohort was 40 (interquartile range: 31–55) years and 49.2% were women. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and dyslipidaemia were present in 20.6%, 18.3%, and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. 26.2% were current smokers and 23.8% had concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus anticoagulant (LA), anti-β2 glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) IgG, anti-β2GPI IgM, anti-cardiolipin (aCL) IgG, and aCL IgM were positive in 76.2%, 27.0%, 11.9%, 27.0%, and 6.3% of the patients, respectively. During a median follow-up duration of 41.5 (interquartile range: 21.4–72.0) months, thrombosis recurred in 9 (7.1%) patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the following scoring system: modified diabetes global APS score (mdGAPSS) = 1*T2DM + 2*LA + 1*anti-β2GPI. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model showed that a higher score was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent thrombosis (adjusted hazard ratio 2.911, 95% confidence interval 1.090–7.770, p = 0.033). The AUC was higher using the mdGAPSS (AUC = 0.706) than the aGAPSS (AUC = 0.553). Compared to the aGAPSS, the mdGAPSS—comprising T2DM, LA, and anti-β2GPI—demonstrated a greater accuracy in predicting recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain (CP) in radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA) is primarily peripheral nociceptive pain. However, many patients experience persistent pain despite treatment, suggesting other underlying mechanisms, such as central sensitization (CS) and neuropathy. This study assessed the presence of CS and/or neuropathic pain (NP) in r-axSpA patients treated at a University Hospital in the state of Paraiba. This quantitative, descriptive, and cross-sectional observational study used a convenience sample collected over 24 weeks. Instruments included the Central Sensitization Inventory - CSI (positive score ≥ 40); The PainDETECT Questionnaire - PD-Q (positive score ≥ 19); clinical epidemiological questionnaires, and preliminary diagnostic for fibromyalgia (FM) [American College of Rheumatology criteria of 2010/2011, revised in 2016], applied when CS positive. Inclusion criteria: patients diagnosed with r-axSpA; aged ≥ 18. Analyses performed: Descriptive; univariate and multivariate linear regressions; Student's T-test. This study included 52 patients (34 men and 18 women), of whom 61.54% had CS. Among these, 65.62% had FM, with an average widespread pain index of 7.87. NP was present in 17.31%, and 15.38% had both CS and NP. The CSI showed a positive correlation with Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index - BASDAI (r = 0.574) and Axial Spondyloarthritis Disease Activity Score - ASDAS (r = 0.622), while the PD-Q was positively correlated with BASDAI (r = 0.515) and ASDAS (r = 0.551). In the univariate analysis, CSI was a predictor (p < 0.001) of both BASDAI and ASDAS, with 40.63% of patients scoring BASDAI ≥ 4 and 43.75% scoring ASDAS ≥ 2.1. Additionally, 66.67% of patients with PD-Q ≥ 19 had BASDAI ≥ 4 and 55.56% had ASDAS ≥ 2.1. The PD-Q was a predictor of BASDAI and ASDAS (p < 0.001). This study is the first in the Brazilian scientific literature to investigate and demonstrate the occurrence of CS and/or NP in patients with r-axSpA, even when adequately treated. Another finding considered relevant was the demonstration of the presence of CS in 34.38% of patients who did not meet preliminary criteria for the diagnosis of FM, emphasizing the importance of investigating other painful mechanisms in chronic inflammatory joint diseases. These findings represent a first step for future research, in larger samples and in other forms of axial spondyloarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To investigate the current status of self-perceived burden (SPB) among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and analyze its influencing factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 RA patients recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Taiyuan city, Shanxi Province. The data was collected through structured questionnaires assessing: General Information Questionnaire, Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, Social Support Rating Scale(SSRS).Multiple linear regression were employed to identify key predictors of SPB. Results From 112 distributed questionnaires, 104 were returned valid, with a 92.85% response rate. RA patients (40.38%) exhibited a moderate SPB, with a mean score of 29.10 ± 10.27. The primary concern was the emotional impact on caregivers, with the highest scores reflecting worry about caregiver burden (3.33±1.47). Multivariate linear regression analysis identified marital status (β = 0.19, P = 0.028), Activities of Daily Living (β=-0.26, P = 0.006), and family monthly income (β=-0.30, P = 0.002) as significant predictors of SPB in RA patients. Conclusions The findings underscore the moderate but significant SPB in RA patients, with key influences being Activities of Daily Living, marital status, and economic factors. These insights are vital for tailoring supportive care and shaping public health strategies to better serve this patient population. Clinical trial registration number Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory B cells (Bregs) play a pivotal role in the immune modulation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The levels of CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs in peripheral blood and their association with clinical indicators in RA patients have not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in peripheral blood CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg levels in RA patients and their association with clinical indicators. Additionally, we explored the variations in Breg levels before and after treatment. Overall, 90 patients with newly diagnosed RA and 32 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Symptoms and laboratory findings were collected. Flow cytometry and three-color fluorescence antibody labeling were employed to detect CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The proportion of CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs among mature B lymphocytes was analyzed, and correlations with clinical indicators were examined. A follow-up study of 26 RA patients was conducted to compare changes in Breg levels before and after six months of treatment. The levels of CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs in RA patients were 89.63% of those in healthy controls. No significant differences in Breg levels were observed among patients with different disease activities. There was a positive correlation between CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg levels and morning stiffness duration (r = 0.227, p = 0.027), and negative correlations with age and anti-CCP antibody titers (r=-0.234, p = 0.022; r=-0.218, p = 0.036). No significant correlations were found between Breg proportions and other clinical indicators. The follow-up study showed a decrease in disease activity scores and a significant increase in CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg levels after six months of treatment. These findings suggest a potential association between Breg levels and the pathogenesis and inflammatory activity of RA. CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs may serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating disease activity and treatment efficacy. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying biological mechanisms and clinical significance of Bregs in RA.",

Aging itself, several chronic diseases and use of concomitant medications are associated with changes in BC, which can lead to cardiovascular events, metabolic complications, increased risk of functional loss, falls and death. Our purpose of the study is to establish BC normative data by DXA in healthy Brazilian children and adolescents. Healthy, eutrophic/overweight children and adolescents aged between 5 and 19 years were included. Medical conditions that could interfere with bone mass or BC were excluded. Participants underwent a clinical interview including details about food intake, sun exposure and physical activity. In addition, anthropometric data, pubertal stage analysis, and lumbar spine and whole body DXA measurements using Hologic QDR 4500 were performed in all participants. Individuals were divided into 4 groups: female and male with two age intervals each (between 5 and 9 years and between 10 and 19 years). BC parameters were bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), total lean mass (TLM), appendicular lean mass (ALM), appendicular lean mass index (ALMI), fat mass (FM), fat mass index (FMI) and android to gynoid fat ratio (A/G) to obtain normative data according to age and gender. A total of 349 healthy volunteers were eligible and enrolled for the study. Females had significantly higher values ​​of fat mass values ​​than males. All BC measurements were significantly higher in pubescent than prepubescent girls and boys. Our data provided BC normative data for healthy male and female Brazilian children and adolescents.

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cell abnormalities may contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Interleukin (IL)-15, an immunoregulatory cytokine crucial for NK survival, is overexpressed in SLE patients. Cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells, which are NK cells pre-activated with short-term IL-12+IL-15+IL-18 followed by incubation with low-dose IL-15 for 1-2 weeks, exhibit enhanced NK effector function upon re-stimulation. We collected blood samples from 54 patients with SLE and 38 healthy volunteers. Extended IL-15 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed. Surface marker analysis, IFN-γ, TNF-α production, and cytotoxicity evaluation were conducted. Next, we generated CIML NK cells by culturing PBMCs with IL-12+IL-15+IL-18. The influence of short-term and long-term IL-15 treatment on CIML NK cells was assessed. Finally, we examined the effect of re-stimulation with IL-12+IL-15+IL-18 on CIML NK cells from SLE patients and healthy controls. Cytotoxicity, CD107a degranulation, and surface marker expression were analyzed. We found that 1. The percentage of CD3-CD56+ NK cells was initially decreased in SLE patients compared with controls, but was enhanced after long-term IL-15 incubation; 2. Long-term IL-15 stimulation facilitated the conversion from CD3-CD56dim to CD3-CD56bright NK cells; 3. CIML NK cells were successfully generated in SLE patients, showing increased percentages of CD3-CD56+ and CD3- CD56bright NK cells and a concomitant decrease in CD3-CD56dim NK cells; 4. SLE CIML NK cells showed decreased IFN-γ, CD69, CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, NKP30, NKP44, NKP46, and granzyme B expression compared with healthy controls; 5. On day 8, re-stimulation with IL-12+IL-15+IL-18 further enhanced the expression of IFN-γ, CD69, CD94, NKG2A, perforin, and granzyme B expression on SLE CIML NK cells; 6. Granzyme B expression in SLE CIML NK cells was higher on day 8 than on day 15. Our findings revealed phenotypic differences and functional deficiencies in SLE CIML NK cells. Further investigation into the role of SLE CIML NK cells in providing antiviral and anti-tumor responses is warranted. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by joint destruction and inflammation. Persistent pain is a common symptom, often impacting quality of life, physical function, and mental health. Despite its prevalence, limited guidance exists for managing chronic rheumatoid arthritis-related pain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various analgesic therapies for managing rheumatoid arthritis-related pain symptoms. Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from database inception through November 7, 2024. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts reporting pain outcomes in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. Pain score data was stratified by scale (5-point, 10-point, 100-point) and analyzed using a random-effects model. Results Twenty-six studies covering 52 treatment regimens were included. Etodolac demonstrated significant pain reduction on a 5-point scale (200 mg: 3.24; 95% CI: 2.86 to 3.63; p &lt; 0.001; 300 mg: 3.35; 95% CI: 2.96 to 3.74; p = 0.00). Piroxicam also showed benefit (20 mg: 3.35; 95% CI: 2.91 to 3.78; p &lt; 0.001). On the 10-point scale, only extracorporeal shock wave therapy significantly reduced pain (3.36; 95% CI: 2.25 to 4.48; p &lt; 0.001). Celecoxib (Celbesta) (200 mg BID) was most effective in the 100-point subgroup (1.73; 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.15; p &lt; 0.001). Heterogeneity was high (I² = 91.1%, 94.1%, 60.2%; all p &lt; 0.05), and publication bias was present. Conclusion Several therapies demonstrated substantial pain relief, but heterogeneity, publication bias, and varying study quality limit generalizability. High-quality, long-term trials with standardized pain assessments are needed to guide personalized rheumatoid arthritis pain management.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because RA is a heterogenous disease and patient response to treatments can vary, identifying characteristics that predict which patients are more likely to respond to TCZ is important for optimal patient care. Serum levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) have been associated with response to TCZ in patients with RA. Objectives To evaluate the association of CXCL13 and sICAM-1 with disease activity and response to TCZ in patients with early RA and those with inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD-IR). Methods Baseline and week 24 serum CXCL13 and sICAM-1 levels were measured using available patient samples from the FUNCTION (early RA) and LITHE (DMARD-IR) trials. Correlations between CXCL13 and sICAM-1 levels and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints calculated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) at baseline and between change in CXCL13 and sICAM-1 and change in DAS28-ESR at week 24 were estimated. CXCL13 and sICAM-1 changes from baseline to week 24 were compared between treatment arms. The effects of TCZ treatment and baseline DAS28-ESR, CXCL13 and sICAM-1 levels on DAS28-ESR remission and 50% improvement per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR50) response at week 24 were determined. Results Overall, 458 patients from FUNCTION and 287 patients from LITHE were included. Correlation of baseline serum CXCL13 and sICAM-1 levels with DAS28-ESR was weak to moderate. CXCL13 and sICAM-1 levels decreased significantly at week 24 in TCZ-treated patients in both the early-RA and DMARD-IR populations. CXCL13 and sICAM-1 changes correlated moderately to weakly with DAS28-ESR changes at week 24 in both populations. The treatment regimen, but not baseline CXCL13 and sICAM-1 levels, had a significant effect on the likelihood of DAS28-ESR remission and ACR50 response. Conclusions Although CXCL13 and sICAM-1 are modestly associated with RA disease activity, they do not predict response to TCZ in all RA populations.",

Increased frequency and levels of antibodies against annexin V have already been observed in several autoimmune diseases including systemic sclerosis (SSc), but their role as a vascular biomarker is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the serum levels and the dynamical behavior of anti-annexin V antibodies over a 24 months follow-up in patients with SSc.In this bicentric cross-sectional study, 70 patients with SSc were consecutively selected from March 2016 to April 2017. Demographic and clinical features, including the presence of active DUs, were collected. Serum anti-annexin V IgG and IgM antibodies were measured at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up. Videocapillaroscopy was performed in all patients.Among the 70 SSc patients included anti-annexin V IgG was found in 11 patients (15.7%) (range of 15.88-39.48 U/mL) and anti-annexin V IgM in 10 patients (14.3%) (range of 14.16-22.69 U/mL) at baseline. During follow-up, the number of patients who were positive for anti-annexin V IgG and IgM remained stable over 24 months. Among the patients with positive anti-annexin V IgG at baseline the frequency of patients with necrosis or amputation of extremities, forced vital capacity less than 70% and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was significantly higher than in patients with negative anti-annexin V IgG antibodies. Patients with anti-annexin V IgG had also a higher Raynaud's Condition Score and a higher Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) than patients without these antibodies at baseline. Patients with positive anti-annexin V IgM at baseline presented a higher frequency of PAH, compared to those with negative anti-annexin V IgM at baseline.Anti-annexin V antibodies are stable and do not change their positivity during a 24 month follow-up in SSc patients. Anti-annexin V IgG was associated with more severe interstitial lung involvement and digital microangiopathy, and patients with anti-annexin V IgG or IgM had a higher occurrence of PAH indicating an association of these biomarker with more severe disease.",

Methods A total of 109 patients with BD were recruited from the Rheumatology Department (outpatient and inpatient clinic), Cairo University Hospitals. All patients were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination, and routine laboratory investigations. Disease activity was assessed by the BD current activity form, and the VDI was calculated in all patients. The relationship of the VDI to the disease clinical manifestations was studied. Mann–Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to estimate differences in quantitative variables. Spearman correlation test was used to test for correlation between quantitative variables. Results In the current study, the VDI ranged from 1 to 10, with a mean of 3.5 ± 1.8. It was significantly associated with total thrombosis ( P = 0.022); total neurological manifestations ( P = 0.000), especially stroke and cranial nerve affection; uveitis ( P = 0.005); avascular necrosis (AVN) ( P = 0.015); osteoporosis ( P = 0.01); impaired vision ( P &lt; 0.0001); cataract ( P &lt; 0.0001); and diabetes ( P = 0.012). Generally, immunosuppressive treatment was significantly associated with VDI ( P = 0.039), especially cyclophosphamide ( P &lt; 0.0001), biological agent ( P = 0.008), chlorambucil ( P = 0.003), and anticoagulant ( P = 0.02). VDI was also significantly correlated with age ( P = 0.033), disease duration ( P = 0.029), and duration of eye involvement ( P = 0.003). Conclusion VDI is significantly associated with most disease parameters of BD, except for parameters such as mucocutaneous manifestations and uncomplicated venous thrombosis; however, further studies may be needed to establish BD-specific damage index.",

The aim of our study was to know the prevalence of non-diagnosed lung disease (airway and interstitial involvement) in patients with early RA and look for associated factors. We designed an observational, multicenter, cross-sectional study, and included patients with RA of less than two years since diagnosis. We performed a structured questionnaire, HRCT and lung functional tests looking for lung disease, together with joint disease evaluation. We analyzed which variables were associated with the presence of lung disease on HRCT. We included 83 patients, 83% females. The median (IQR) of time since RA diagnosis was 3 (1-6) months. In the HRCT, 57 patients had airway compromisea (72%), and 6 had interstitial abnormalities (7.5%). The most common altertion found in lung functional tests was a reduced DLCO (14%). The presence of at least one abnormality in the physical exam was associated with lung involvement on HRCT [13 (21.6%) vs 0 (0%); p = 0.026]. Also, patients with lung involvement presented significantly lower values of FVC% and DLCO%, and higher values of RV/TLC. No variable related to joint involvement was found associated with alterations in HRCT. Our study shows that a large proportion of early RA patients has abnormal findings in HRCT.

The meta-analysis effect size was estimated using either incidence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or odds ratio (OR)/relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs. The risk of bias and heterogeneity among studies were assessed and analyzed. Results Forty studies were included, involving 6,041,254 participants. The incidence of joint replacement in patients with OA varied according to the study design and treatments. The incidence of knee arthroplasty varied from 0 to 70.88%, while the incidence of hip arthroplasty varied from 11.71 to 96.43%. Compared to non-users, bisphosphonate users had a reduced risk of knee replacement (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.66–0.77; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70–0.83). Compared to intra-articular corticosteroid users, hyaluronic acid (HA) users had a higher risk of knee arthroplasty (RR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.38–2.25). No publication bias was observed. Conclusions Bisphosphonate treatment is associated with a reduced risk of knee replacement. More studies are needed to validate our results due to the limited number of eligible studies and high heterogeneity among studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The observation that 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ([18F]F-FDG-PET/MRI) revealed high-grade arterial wall FDG uptake, without arterial wall thickening with contrast-enhancement, in a considerable number of c-TA patients in our previous study, encouraged us to compare patients with both PET and MR angiography (MRA) positives, with those with PET positive but MRA negative. Our aim was to evaluate the relevance of these two imaging modalities together. Methods A three-center cross-sectional study with 17 patients who fulfilled the EULAR/PRINTO/PReS criteria for c-TA and who underwent [18F]F-FDG-PET/MRI was previously performed. Herein we compared patients/vessels with positive PET (arterial wall 18 F-FDG uptake higher than liver) and positive MRA (arterial wall thickening with contrast-enhancement)—group 1, with those with positive PET but negative MRA—group 2. Results Median disease duration of 17 c-TA patients was 10.4 years. Nine patients were classified as group 1 and six as group 2. Median of metabolic inflammatory volume (MIV) of all arterial segments was significantly higher in group 1 (2346 vs. 1177 cm 3 ; p = 0.036). Fifty-four (19%) from 284 available arterial segments presented positive findings in vessel wall in one or both images. Positive findings were concordant between PET and MRA in only 13% arterial segments (group 1); most changes (28–59.6%) that were discordant between both images, were positive in PET and negative in MRA (group 2). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that [18F]F-FDG-PET/MRI added information about inflammation in vessel wall of c-TA patients. Prospective multicenter studies are needed in order to get solid data to guide immunosuppressive tapering and withdrawal.",

The overall positivity for HLA-B27 was 4.35% (CI 95% 4.32-4.37%), regardless of sex and age (57.2% were women, mean age was 41.7yo). However, there was a difference between races: 4.85% in Whites; 2.92% in Blacks; 3.76% in Pardos (Browns i.e. mixed races); 3.95% in Amarelos (Yellows i.e. Asian Brazilians); and 3.18% in Indigenous.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The relationship between humidity and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has yielded inconsistent results in prior research, while the effects of humidity on lupus in animal experiments and its underlying mechanism remain inadequately explored. Methods The present study aimed to investigate the impact of high humidity (80 ± 5%) on lupus using female and male MRL/lpr mice, with a particular focus on elucidating the role of gut microbiota in this process. To this end, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was employed to transfer the gut microbiota of MRL/lpr mice under high humidity to blank MRL/lpr mice under normal humidity (50 ± 5%), allowing for an assessment of the effect of FMT on lupus. Results The study revealed that high humidity exacerbated lupus indices (serum anti-dsDNA, ANA, IL-6, and IFN- g, and renal pathology) in female MRL/lpr mice but had no significant effect on male MRL/lpr mice. The aggravation of lupus caused by high humidity may be attributed to the increased abundances of the Rikenella , Romboutsia , Turicibacter , and Escherichia-Shigella genera in female MRL/lpr mice. Furthermore, FMT also exacerbated lupus in female MRL/lpr mice but not in male MRL/lpr mice. Conclusion In summary, this study has demonstrated that high humidity exacerbated lupus by modulating gut microbiota in female MRL/lpr mice. The findings underscore the importance of considering environmental factors and gut microbiota in the development and progression of lupus, particularly among female patients.",

Also, other studies have shown that curcumin inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion, and Inflammation and on the other hand increases the apoptosis of RA FLSs. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of curcumin, a natural anti-inflammatory micronutrient, on the expression of NOD2 and inflammatory cytokines.Synovial membranes were collected from ten patients diagnosed with RA and ten individuals with traumatic injuries scheduled for knee surgery. The FLSs were isolated and treated with 40 μM curcumin alone or in combination with 20.3 μM MDP for 24 h. mRNA was extracted, and real-time PCR was performed to quantitatively measure gene expression levels of NOD2, p65, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β.The study findings indicate that administering MDP alone can significantly increase the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in the trauma group and TNF-α in the RA group. Conversely, administering curcumin alone or in combination whit MDP can significantly reduce mRNA expression levels of P65 and IL-6 in FLSs of both groups. Moreover, in FLSs of RA patients, a single curcumin treatment leads to a significant reduction in NOD2 gene expression.This study provides preliminary in vitro evidence of the potential benefits of curcumin as a nutritional supplement for RA patients. Despite the limitations of the study being an investigation of the FLSs of RA patients, the results demonstrate that curcumin has an anti-inflammatory effect on NOD2 and NF-κB genes. These findings suggest that curcumin could be a promising approach to relieve symptoms of RA.",

Triptolide is a diterpene triepoxide extracted from Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, with potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. Our previous work observed that triptolide alleviated lupus in MRL/lpr lupus mice with the upregulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) proportion in previous study. In this study, we explored the proportion of follicular T regulatory (Tfr), follicular T helper (Tfh) and germinal center (GC) B cells in lupus mice and evaluated the efficacy of triptolide for lupus treatment in vivo.20 female MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups and treated orally with vehicle or triptolide. C3H mice were all housed as controlled group and treated orally with vehicle. The percentage of Tfr cells, Tfh cells and GC B cells in spleen of mice were detected by Flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemistry after 13 weeks of treatment.We found that the percentage of Tfr cells decreased in MRL/lpr mice compared with controlled mice. The percentage of Tfh cells in MRL/lpr mice was significantly higher compared with that in controlled mice. The ratio of Tfr/Tfh is also decreased in lupus mice. After treated with triptolide in MRL/Lpr mice in vivo, the percentage of Tfr cells and ratio of Tfr/Tfh increased. The proportion of GC B cells also decreased in mice treated with triptolide by FACS and immunohistochemistry.Our results demonstrate that the effect of triptolide in alleviating lupus is partly by reversing immune imbalance with increased percentage of Tfr cells and ratio of Tfr/Tfh. Triptolide might also has effect on immune response through inhibiting proliferating GC B cells.",

However, there are no data addressing its relevance regarding therapeutic decision-making in clinical practice. Objective To evaluate the impact of EMMs to drive the treatment decision-making in patients with SpA in a 12-month follow-up. Patients and methods SpA patients, according to the axial and peripheral ASAS classification criteria, as well as CASPAR criteria, with any active EMM, defined as main entry criteria, were included in this longitudinal cohort study. Individuals with a history of any disease or condition that could be associated with some of the studied endpoints, including neoplasms and infectious diseases, were excluded. Specific tools related to each EMM, including Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), ophthalmologic evaluation, according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria, and gut complaints were used at baseline and during the 3-, 6- and 12-month of follow-up as outcomes measures over time. Descriptive and inferential analyses were used appropriately, including Pearson’s correlation test, chi-squared test, and ANOVA. P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Results A total of 560 patients were enrolled, of whom 472 meet the eligibility criteria. The majority (N = 274; 59.6%) had one or more EMM related to SpA umbrella concept . Among the EMM, the one that most influenced therapeutic decision-making was psoriasis (28.5%), followed by uveitis (17.5%) and IBD (5.5%), regardless of musculoskeletal manifestations. Clinical improvement of EMMs outcomes was observed in most patients over 12-month follow-up, especially in those with rAAU and IBD ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Our results showed that EMMs guided the therapeutic decision-making in half of SpA patients, regardless of musculoskeletal condition, suggesting the inter-disciplinarity among the rheumatologist, ophthalmologist, dermatologist, and gastroenterologist plays a crucial role to manage them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Cardiac involvement is one of the most serious complications of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) that indicates poor prognosis. However, there is a lack of effective biomarkers for the identification of cardiac involvement and the prediction of prognosis in IIM. Here, we aimed to explore the value of different cardiac biomarkers in IIM patients. Methods A total of 142 IIM patients in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Ruijin Hospital from July 2019 to October 2022 were included in this study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments and prognosis were recorded. The disease activity was assessed according to the core set measures. The correlations of the serum cardiac biomarkers levels with disease activity were analyzed by the Spearman correlation test. Risk factors for cardiac involvement were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Higher high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels were associated with cardiac involvement (n = 41) in IIM patients [adjusted OR 7.810 (95% CI: 1.962–31.097); p = 0.004], independent of other serum cardiac biomarkers. The abnormal hs-cTnI had the highest AUC for distinguishing of cardiac involvement in IIM patients (AUC = 0.848, 95% CI: 0.772,0.924; p &lt; 0.001). Besides, we found that high serum levels of hs-cTnI were significantly correlated with disease activity. Moreover, patients with higher serum levels of hs-cTnI tended to suffer from poor prognosis. Conclusions Serum hs-cTnI testing may play a role in screening for cardiac involvement in IIM patients. Abnormal levels of serum hs-cTnI were associated with increased disease activity and poor prognosis.",

This article reports one case of a patient with SSc developing NCIPH and presents a systematic review of previously reported cases. CARE guidelines and the PRISMA statement were applied. We report the case of a 52 year-old woman, presenting, in 2015, diffuse cutaneous scleroderma (SSc), treated with oral prednisolone and monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide. Three months later, she developed a scleroderma renal crisis, requiring hemodialysis for 18 months. Since 2017 she has not been on immunosuppressive treatment for SSc, the cutaneous involvement improved, and she has a stable Kdigo 3 chronic kidney disease. In 2019, she developed ascites. During investigation, NCIPH leading to small and medium esophageal varices and collateral circulation was diagnosed. Currently, the patient is undergoing prophylactic endoscopic band ligation of the esophageal varices and presents a stable condition. In the systematic review, 18 papers reporting 20 cases of NCIPH associated with SSc were included. Seventeen (81%) patients were women, with [Mean (SD)]: 56.71 (12.97) years. Classification of SSc was (N = 15): 10 limited, 4 diffuse, and 1 sin scleroderma. Clinical presentation of NCIPH was esophageal and/or gastric varices [19 (90,5%)], ascites [10 (47,6%)], and upper gastrointestinal bleeding [9 (42,8%)]. NCIPH was treated with diuretics [n = 9 (42,8%)], endoscopic esophageal varices sclerosis or band ligation [n = 7 (35%)], and beta-blockers [n = 4 (19%)]. Recovery of symptoms, or stabilization of clinical condition was reported in nine patients. Despite the death of seven patients, only one was attributed to the hepatic condition. NCIPH has been rarely reported in SSc patients. NCIPH prognosis in SSc is good. Due to the scarcity of cases reporting the occurrence of both diseases, the characteristics of SSc patients at risk of developing NCIPH remain unclear.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a musculoskeletal syndrome characterized by diffuse and chronic pain associated with other symptoms such as fatigue, sleep/cognition disorders, headache, depression and anxiety, resulting from a change in pain processing. Previous research has shown an increase in some interleukins (IL) in patients with FM when compared to controls, however, there is still no uniformity and consensus in the results. There is no study that evaluates IL8 mRNA expression in FM and its association with obesity and other clinical parameters. This study aims to verify the impact of IL8 mRNA expression on the clinical parameters of patients with FM (FMG) in relation to the comparison group (CG). Method This study evaluated patients diagnosed with FM treated at the rheumatology service of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Federal University of Pernambuco (HC-UFPE). The CG group was composed of individuals without chronic pain (companions of the patients and hospital employees). Clinical and demographic data were collected in both groups, and questionnaires for fatigue (FACIT-F), impact of FM (FIQ-R), depression (BDI), and sleep (NRS) were applied to both groups. Peripheral blood was collected for evaluation of IL8 gene expression through real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results Patients with FM show a lower frequency of IL8 gene expression compared to the CG, but FMG presented mainly up regulated in relation to CG. There was no association of IL8 expression and worse FIQ-R indices, sleep disturbance, BMI or fatigue. However, there was an association between IL8 expression and moderate depression ( p = 0.002) and physical activity ( p = 0.039), where patients in FMG who did express IL8 were practicing less physical activity. Conclusion Patients in FMG did not have a higher frequency of IL8 expression compared to CG, however patients with IL8 expression have a greater association with moderate depression.",

Consequently, this study aimed to analyze this entity from our tertiary center and review the relevant literature. Methods This retrospective observational cross-sectional study and case series included patients with DM/CADM and psoriasis between 1998 and 2024. A literature review was also conducted. Results Nine of 331 patients with DM ( n = 265)/CADM ( n = 66) had psoriasis; six were female, and all were of white ethnicity. The median age at DM diagnosis was 38 years (range: 18–78), and at psoriasis diagnosis was 43 years (range: 18–81), with a median interval of four years between diagnoses. The follow-up revealed that six patients were discharged, two died, and one continued follow-up. The primary comorbidities included systemic arterial hypertension ( n = 3) and diabetes mellitus ( n = 3). Four patients presented with varicella zoster ( n = 1) or pulmonary tuberculosis ( n = 3). Regarding the literature review, 15 articles reported a total of 17 cases of overlapping DM/CADM and psoriasis. However, variability was observed in the DM/CADM diagnostic criteria. The mean age at DM diagnosis in the literature was 32.3 years (range: 2–59), whereas for psoriasis, it was 31 (7–63) years. Female patients were predominant. Conclusion This investigation identified the coexistence of DMPs, with a median age of 38 years for DM and 43 years for psoriasis. The variability in the diagnostic criteria underscores the necessity for standardized approaches to enhance patient management.",

Additionally, a literature review was conducted. Methods A total of 47 Brazilian patients with RP between 2000 and 2024 were analyzed. All patient data were collected from pre-parametrized and pre-standardized electronic medical records. A literature review using PubMed with “relapsing polychondritis” as the search term included 25 articles after applying the strict exclusion criteria. Results A total of 47 patients were evaluated. The median age was 40 (34–51) years, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.4:1, and 89.4% were of white ethnicity. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 39 months and the median follow-up duration was 7 years. Ear cartilage biopsy was performed in 12.8% of cases. The clinical manifestations included auricular chondritis, arthralgia, and ocular involvement. Approximately half of the patients had hypertension and dyslipidemia, one-third had diabetes mellitus, and one-fifth had hypothyroidism. Tracheostomy and cochlear implantation were required in 12.8% and 6.4% of the patients, respectively. Disease outcomes showed that 46.8% of patients were in remission, 29.8% had active disease, and 25.5% were controlled with immunosuppressive therapy. Mortality occurred in 6.4% of the cases. In the literature review, 25 studies were analyzed, most of which originated in Asia. Studies have reported the classical manifestations of RP, such as auricular chondritis, arthritis, and ocular involvement. The median age of the patients with RP was similar across studies, averaging 46.4 years, with a predominance of female patients. A comparison with the literature showed consistency in clinical manifestations, particularly auricular chondritis and septum nasal chondritis, although few studies have explored comorbidities, disease evolution, and outcomes. Conclusions The reviewed articles described classical clinical manifestations, but few articles reported data on other manifestations and comorbidities that can occur in RP. Our study provided new insights by mapping symptom evaluations, thereby enhancing the understanding of disease evolution. Understanding and characterizing RP will allow for better assistance in its diagnosis and follow-up.",

Imaging is crucial for the diagnosis and evaluation of TAK, but the rational selection of imaging methods and interpretation of imaging results are major challenges in clinical practice, which can affect treatment decisions. This guideline aims to establish standardized protocols for selecting imaging modalities (as well as interpreting their findings) in TAK. Relevant clinical questions were formulated by an expert panel. Systematic reviews of evidence published from database establishment to 31 October 2023 were done. The grading system set by the Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center was employed to assess the quality of evidence. Recommendations were developed through consensus using the Delphi method. Seventeen recommendation statements were developed based on evidence summaries and consensus. The first four recommendations focused on overarching principles. Recommendations 5 to 14 covered the advantages and disadvantages of different imaging modalities, as well as the selection of imaging modalities in the diagnosis and evaluation of TAK, including ultrasound (three statements), magnetic resonance angiography (two), computed tomography angiography (two), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (two), and digital subtraction angiography (one). Recommendations 15 to 17 focused on the selection of imaging methods for special populations and organ perfusion. These recommendations could help to standardize the use of imaging modalities by clinicians in the diagnosis and evaluation of TAK. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in childhood, but its outcomes are still difficult to determine. We aimed to obtain outcome measurements of disease activity, functional capacity, disease damage, and therapeutic response, at one-year follow-up study on a real-life basis. Methods An observational JIA cohort from two referral centers for pediatric rheumatology in Brazil Pediatric Rheumatology Centers was carried out over a period of one year. Clinimetric validated outcome measurements were applied over four visits. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate baseline variables associated with the following outcomes after one year of follow-up: disease activity, Minimal Disease Activity (MDA), disease flare, remission on medication and remission off medication. Results A total of 127 patients were included in the study. Eighty-three (65.4%) were females, and median time to diagnosis was 6.0 months. JADAS71 and CHAQ improved during follow-up (mean Vbaseline 7.05 ± 9.3 vs. V52 3.52 ± 8.4; 0 ± 0.5 vs. 0.14 ± 0.4, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) as well as JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70 and 90 (Vbaseline 79.8% vs. V52 88.8%; 71.4% vs. 84.1%; 59.7% vs. 77.6%; 49.6% vs. 69.2%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Inactive disease was present in 33% of patients at baseline and in 67.9% at V52 ( p &lt; 0.001). Remission on medication, remission off medication and MDA were present in 46%, 11%, and 80.6% of patients at V52, respectively. Extra-articular and articular damage were not common at baseline (0.3 ± 0.7 and 1.1 ± 3.4 respectively) and did not decrease significantly during the period of the study. The presence of active joints 46/101 (45.5%) at baseline reduced the chance of the patient achieving remission off medication at the last visit by 84% (OR = 0.16; CI 95% from 0.03 to 0.91, p = 0.039). Conclusion This study showed improvement in clinimetric outcome measurements and therapeutic responses in an inception cohort of JIA patients. The presence of active joints at baseline is related to not achieving remission at last visit. Long-term prospective and multicenter studies are needed to better assess the outcome of JIA and the differences among JIA subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Myocardial fibrosis is an important adverse prognostic marker, however; determinants of myocardial fibrosis in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) remain poorly defined. We aimed to identify determinants of myocardial fibrosis in patients with IMIDs, as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) extracellular volume (ECV). Methods Cross-sectional study of 116 patients with IMIDs undergoing clinical CMR at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. IMIDs included rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis (SSc), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and vasculitis. CMR included pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping to measure myocardial ECV, with same day blood sampling. Determinants of ECV were investigated with univariable and multivariable linear regression. Results ECV varied significantly according to IMID diagnosis (ANOVA F statistic 2.80, P = 0.015); ECV was higher in patients with SSc compared to other IMIDs. Major determinants of ECV as a continuous variable were SSc, smoking and body mass index (BMI); regression coefficients 3.33 (95% confidence interval 0.82–5.84), 3.08 (0.73–5.43), and − 0.19 (-0.29 – -0.09) respectively, P &lt; 0.01 (SSc, smoking and lower BMI were associated with increased ECV). Approximately a quarter of the variability in ECV could be explained by these predictors (optimism adjusted R 2 0.265). Conclusion SSc is associated with a higher burden of myocardial fibrosis compared to other IMIDs. In patients with IMIDs, independent determinants of myocardial fibrosis were presence of SSc, smoking and BMI. Importantly, participants underwent CMR for clinical indications and may not be representative of IMID populations in the community.",

We described and analyzed the risk factors for maternal and fetal complications in SLE pregnancies at an outpatient clinic in the State of Amazonas, Northern Brazil. Methods Pregnancies that occurred after the SLE diagnosis between 2001 and 2020 were analyzed. Risk factors for adverse outcomes were determined using logistic regression. Results A total of 155 pregnancies from 109 women were included; the mean age was 28.2 ( $$\\pm$$ 5.5) years, the median disease duration was 72 [36; 108] months, 56 (36.1%) had active disease prior to pregnancy, 39 (26.5%) had nephritis, 30 (20.3%) had cutaneous manifestations, and the incidence of disease activity during pregnancy was 29.7%; there was a 12.3% (95% CI, [4.2; 20.4]) increase in the proportion of patients with active disease, there were 35 (22.9%) fetal deaths, 26 (16.8%) cases of preeclampsia, 44 (37.3%) preterm births, 16 (16.2%) cases of low birth weight for gestational age, and 18 (18.8%) cases of intrauterine growth restriction. Risk factors for maternal events included immunological alterations (OR=3.02; 95% CI [1.11; 8.21]), renal involvement (OR=3.74; 95% CI [1.25; 11.21]), and disease activity before pregnancy (OR=1.30; 95% CI [1.04; 1.64]); the use of hydroxychloroquine before pregnancy was protective (OR=0.23; 95% CI [0.08; 0.67]). Risk factors for fetal events included the use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during pregnancy (OR=5.22; 95% CI [1.33; 20.54]) and disease activity during pregnancy (OR=1.31; 95% CI [1.14; 1.52]); the use of antimalarials before and during pregnancy was protective (OR=0.14; 95% CI [0.04; 0.44]). According to the post-hoc analysis, the probability of a Type S error in the ASA association was 100%. The retrospective nature and the presence of missing data about laboratory tests are the main limitations of this study. Conclusion Pregnancy management in SLE presents a unique set of challenges that require a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach. Careful monitoring of disease activity, appropriate medication management, and psychosocial support are essential for optimizing maternal and fetal health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic fatigue severely compromises the quality of life in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming, relying on clinical expertise and detailed questionnaires. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting chronic fatigue in GPA patients based on clinical data, with a particular focus on improving diagnostic capacity in regions with limited access to specialists. Methods This cross-sectional study collected data on fatigue (measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MFIS), functional ability (Health Assessment Questionnaire, HAQ), disease activity (Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, BVAS), comorbidities, medication use, physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form, IPAQ-SF), and demographic characteristics. Four machine learning algorithms—logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting—were assessed using a 70/30 train-test split. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. Statistical comparisons were performed using Welch’s t-test and the Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables, while the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was applied to categorical variables, with significance set at P &lt; 0.05. All analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.1 for Windows. Results Forty-five patients were assessed: 62.2% were female, with a median BMI of 27.72 kg/m² (23.2–30.1), a median age of 55.5 years, and a median disease duration of 12.0 years (6.0–17.0). Fatigue was reported by 20 patients (MFIS score ≥ 38), and seven patients (15.5%) had active disease according to the BVAS, which was similar between the fatigued and no fatigued groups ( P &gt; 0.05). The fatigued group had more acute-phase reactants and prednisone use ( P &lt; 0.05). The tree-based models achieved an AUC of approximately 0.80, outperforming the other models. Conclusion Tree-based models demonstrated superior predictive performance in identifying chronic fatigue. The Random Forest model, in particular, highlighted higher disability in activities of daily living (HAQ), older age, and longer disease duration as key predictors. Although the models performed well, additional data and incorporation of clinically relevant variables may further enhance predictive accuracy. Patients with GPA who experienced fatigue showed higher glucocorticoid use and elevated acute-phase reactants, despite similar levels of disease activity, suggesting mechanisms beyond inflammation. Machine learning shows strong potential as a clinical tool for fatigue identification, especially in settings with limited access to specialist care.

    "abstract": "TNF-inhibitors like adalimumab (ADA) have been vital for managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for over two decades. With the emergence of biosimilars, real-life evidence is crucial to confirm their sustained efficacy after switching from originator drugs. This study aims to provide comprehensive evaluation of the clinical outcomes of transitioning from adalimumab reference product (ADA-RP) to the biosimilar adalimumab–AACF (ADA-AACF) in patients with RA over a 12-month period in a real-world analysis. This observational study included RA patients who had been on ADA-RP for at least three months before switching to ADA-AACF. Disease activity parameters, including DAS28-CRP, CDAI, SDAI, and CRP-levels, were assessed at baseline (T0) and compared at 6 (T6) and 12 months (T12) following the switch. Sixteen patients were included, with a mean duration of ADA-RP use of 69.9 months. DAS28-CRP remained stable when comparing T0 to T6 [2.36 (1.92–2.84) vs. 1.83 (1.72–3.16), p = 0.988] and T12 [2.36 (1.92–2.84) vs. 2.54 (2.09–2.86), p = 0.874], with similar results for SDAI and CDAI (p > 0.05). The frequency of low disease activity was consistent during the follow-up: 81.3% at T0; 68.8% at T6 (p = 0.617) and 81.3% at T12 (p = 0.480) for DAS28-CRP < 3.2. The same pattern was observed for CDAI ≤ 10 and SDAI ≤ 11 (p > 0.05). CRP-levels and prednisone doses did not show significant variation (p > 0.05) across time points. The biosimilar retention rate was 87.5%, with two patients discontinuing biosimilar before the 12-month mark. This real-world study demonstrates the feasibility and sustained efficacy of transitioning from ADA-RP to ADA-AACF in RA patients, reinforcing its role in long-term disease management. These findings in an ethnically diverse population contribute to the growing global evidence on biosimilar adoption, supporting their integration into routine clinical practice and expanding treatment accessibility.",

AIH was defined according to the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group criteria (IAHGC). The statistical analysis was performed using the Bonferroni's correction (p < 0.0033). AIH in cSLE patients confirmed by biopsy was observed in 7/847 (0.8%) and all were diagnosed during adolescence. The majority occurred before or at cSLE diagnosis [5/7 (71%)]. Antinuclear antibodies were a universal finding, 43% had concomitantly anti-smooth muscle antibodies and all were seronegative for anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies.

None had severe hepatic manifestations such as hepatic failure, portal hypertension and cirrhosis at presentation or follow-up. Further comparison of 7 cSLE patients with AIH and 28 without this complication with same disease duration [0 (0–8.5) vs. 0.12 (0–8.5) years, p = 0.06] revealed that the frequency of hepatomegaly was significantly higher in cSLE patients in the former group (71% vs. 11%, p = 0.003) with a similar median SLEDAI-2 K score [6 (0–26) vs. 7 (0–41), p = 0.755].

    "abstract": "The aims of this article were to assess the prevalence of nephrolithiasis and the factors associated with nephrolithiasis in Brazilian patients with primary gout.One hundred twenty-three patients with primary gout were recruited from a tertiary referral hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. All patients underwent ultrasonography and had their clinical and laboratory characteristics assessed.One hundred fifteen (93.5%) patients were male, with a mean age of 62.9 ± 9.4 years. Twenty-three (18.7%) patients had asymptomatic nephrolithiasis (detected only by ultrasonography), 7 (6.0%) had symptomatic nephrolithiasis (detected by ultrasonography and a positive clinical history), and 13 (10.0%) had a history of kidney stones, but ultrasonography at evaluation did not show nephrolithiasis. Therefore, 35.0% of the patients had nephrolithiasis (detected either by ultrasonography and/or a positive clinical history). Nephrolithiasis was associated with male gender (43 [100%] vs 72 [90%], p = 0.049), the use of potassium citrate (13 [30.2%] vs 0, p < 0.001) and the use of medications for diabetes (10 [23.3%] vs 8 [10%], p = 0.047) and dyslipidemia (15 [34.9%] vs 10 [12.5%], p = 0.003); benzbromarone had an inverse association with nephrolithiasis (21 [48.8%] vs 55 [68.8%], p = 0.030). In patients with and without nephrolithiasis, no differences were found in the laboratory and ultrasonography characteristics, including serum uric acid levels, urinary uric acid excretion and urine pH.The prevalence of nephrolithiasis in primary gout was 35.0%, and 18.7% of the patients were asymptomatic. Nephrolithiasis was associated with male gender, diabetes and dyslipidemia. A positive history of nephrolithiasis probably biased the prescription of potassium citrate and benzbromarone.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess gait pattern of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM) while performing demanding motor and/or cognitive dual tasks while walking. Further, idea was to explore possible correlations of dual task gait pattern alterations to patients' functional status and presence or absence of clinical symptoms associated with FM.Twenty-four female FM patients and 24 healthy female subjects performed a basic walking task, a dual motor, a dual mental (cognitive) and a combined, dual motor and cognitive task simultaneously. Quantitative spatial (stride length) and temporal (cycle time, swing time and double support time) gait parameters were measured using GAITRite walkway system and their variability was assessed. Patients underwent clinical examination including assessment of functional status, pain and fatigue level, psychiatric and cognitive manifestations.The motor, cognitive and combined dual tasks affect gait performance in FM patients. Difference in tasks between FM and healthy subjects was found as double support time prolongation. Comparison of tasks showing that cycle time in FM was longer than controls and stride length was shorter in patients for all conditions, while no changes were found in any of the gait parameters variability. Further, mental/cognitive dual tasks had a larger effect than motor tasks. Correlations were also found between depression and functional status of the patients and the gait parameters.Gait is affected in FM patients while dual task walking. No changes in stride-to-stride variability point that patients preserve stability in complex walking situations. Analysis of gait may provide additional information for the FM identification based on presence of clinical features and cognitive status. Correlation of dual task gait alterations with occurrence of clinical symptoms and influence of cognitive changes on gait pattern could additionally define FM subgroups.",

Our aim was to compare the occurrence of COVID-19 between rheumatic disease patients on hydroxychloroquine with individuals from the same household not taking the drug during the first 8 weeks of community viral transmission in Brazil. Methods This baseline cross-sectional analysis is part of a 24-week observational multi-center study involving 22 Brazilian academic outpatient centers. All information regarding COVID-19 symptoms, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data were recorded on a specific web-based platform using telephone calls from physicians and medical students. COVID-19 was defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health (BMH) criteria. Mann–Whitney, Chi-square and Exact Fisher tests were used for statistical analysis and two binary Final Logistic Regression Model by Wald test were developed using a backward-stepwise method for the presence of COVID-19. Results From March 29th to May 17st, 2020, a total of 10,443 participants were enrolled, including 5166 (53.9%) rheumatic disease patients, of whom 82.5% had systemic erythematosus lupus, 7.8% rheumatoid arthritis, 3.7% Sjögren’s syndrome and 0.8% systemic sclerosis. In total, 1822 (19.1%) participants reported flu symptoms within the 30 days prior to enrollment, of which 3.1% fulfilled the BMH criteria, but with no significant difference between rheumatic disease patients (4.03%) and controls (3.25%). After adjustments for multiple confounders, the main risk factor significantly associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis was lung disease (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.03–2.58); and for rheumatic disease patients were diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.19–6.63) and glucocorticoids above 10 mg/ day (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.31–3.19). In addition, a recent influenza vaccination had a protective effect (OR 0.674; 95% CI 0.46–0.98). Conclusion Patients with rheumatic disease on hydroxychloroquine presented a similar occurrence of COVID-19 to household cohabitants, suggesting a lack of any protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study evaluated the impact of hospitalization on mortality in an ethnically and racially diverse cohort of CTD-ILD patients. Methods We conducted a medical records review study at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. We included 96 patients and collected data on demographic characteristics, reasons for hospitalization, length of stay, immunosuppressant therapy use, and mortality. We stratified our patients into two cohorts: hospitalized and non-hospitalized. The hospitalized cohort was further subdivided into cardiopulmonary and non-cardiopulmonary admissions. Two-sample tests or Wilcoxon’s rank sum tests for continuous variables and Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables were used for analyses as deemed appropriate. Results We identified 213 patients with CTD-ILD. Out of them, 96 patients met the study’s inclusion criteria. The majority of patients were females (79%), and self-identified as Hispanic (54%) and Black (40%). The most common CTDs were rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (29%), inflammatory myositis (22%), and systemic sclerosis (15%). The majority (76%) of patients required at least one hospitalization. In the non-hospitalized group, no deaths were observed, however we noted significant increase of mortality risk in hospitalized group ( p = 0.02). We also observed that prolonged hospital stay (&gt; 7 days) as well as older age and male sex were associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Prolonged (&gt; 7 days) hospital stay and hospitalization for cardiopulmonary causes, as well as older age and male sex were associated with an increased mortality risk in our cohort of CTD-ILD patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The labial salivary glands (LSGs) are important for the diagnosis, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, and genetic analyses of primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). In autoimmune diseases, the recognition of self nucleic acids and viral RNA and DNA through endogenous Toll-like receptor(TLR) triggers the production of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the occurrence and progression of the disease. Here, we detected the expression of TLR7 in LSGs and analyse its correlation with clinical features and serum cytokines in pSS patients. Methods LSGs and serum samples were obtained from 56 pSS patients and 19 non-SS patients (non-pSS patients). The expression of TLR7 in the LSGs was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. The serum levels of interferon-α (IFN-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified by ELISA. Laboratory parameters were measured by clinical standard laboratory techniques. Results TLR7-positive cells in pSS were localized in the ductal epithelial cells and lymphocytes of LSGs. The expression of TLR7 was upregulated in pSS patients compared with controls. Patients with anti-Ro52 antibody positivity showed higher TLR7 levels than those who were negative but not those with anti-Ro60 and anti-SSB. TLR7 levels were positively associated with the levels of IgG, IgA, ANA, IL-6, IFN-α and serum globulin but were not associated with IgM, C3, C4, or rheumatoid factor (RF) in serum. Conclusion TLR7 may be involved in the inflammatory response and the production of antibodies in pSS and plays an important role in local and systemic pSS manifestations. This research showed that TLR7 is involved in pSS pathogenesis.",

In this study, we investigated the clinical course of NTM-PD in patients with RA and the impact of RA on the prognosis of NTM-PD. Methods We analyzed patients who developed NTM-PD after being diagnosed with RA from January 2004 to August 2023 at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. The patient’s baseline characteristics, clinical course, and prognosis were evaluated. An optimal matching analysis was performed to measure the impact of RA on the risk of mortality. Results During the study period, 18 patients with RA [median age, 68 years; interquartile range (IQR) 59–73; female, 88.9%] developed NTM-PD. The median interval between RA diagnosis and subsequent NTM-PD development was 14.8 years (IQR, 8.6–19.5). At a median of 30 months (IQR, 27–105) after NTM-PD diagnosis, 10 of 18 (55.6%) patients received anti-mycobacterial treatment for NTM-PD and 5 (50.0%) patients achieved microbiological cure. When matched to patients with NTM-PD but without RA, patients with both RA and NTM-PD had a higher risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 8.14; 95% confidence interval, 2.43–27.2). Conclusion NTM-PD occurring after RA is associated with a higher risk of mortality than NTM-PD in the absence of RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Nail involvement is frequent in patients with psoriasis (Pso) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and there is a relationship between nail involvement and inflammation of the enthesis. The main objective of the present study is to describe the ultrasound findings and clinical characteristics of nails from patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with and without nail dystrophy. Methods A cross-sectional study including consecutive patients with PsO and PsA was carried out. The study patients were divided into 4 groups, totaling 120 participants. Group 1: patients with psoriasis vulgaris and clinically normal nails; Group 2: patients with psoriasis vulgaris and onychodystrophy; Group 3: patients with psoriatic arthritis and clinically normal nails; Group 4: patients with psoriatic arthritis and onychodystrophy; All patients were submitted to dermatological and rheumatological clinical analysis. Ultrasound examinations was performed by a single examiner, blinded to all clinical data, with ultrasound high resolution, in B-mode or gray-scale (GS), Power Doppler (PD) and Spectral Doppler. Results A significant difference was found between the groups regarding the variable Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ( p = 0.008) and body surface area (BSA) ( p = 0.005), with patients with psoriatic arthritis having lower PASI and BSA compared to patients with only cutaneous psoriasis. A positive relationship was found with the average ultrasound thickness of the nail bed and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) in correlation analysis ( rho = 0.344). When we grouped patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, there was no significant difference between the cutaneous psoriasis groups and the psoriatic arthritis groups in terms of nail plate GS ( p = 0.442), nail bed PD ( p = 0.124). Conclusion Greater nail bed thickness indicates early psoriatic nail disease, as confirmed in our study correlating NAPSI with nail bed thickness. Ultrasonography is a low-cost exam, promising in the evaluation, showing that the ultrasound grayscale is consistent with those who have dystrophic nails, but it can’t distinguish psoriasis from psoriatic arthritis, even in those with nail dystrophy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Musculoskeletal chronic pain is a leading cause of global disability and laboral incapacity. However, there is a lack of population-based studies that investigate the relationship between chronic pain and mental disorders with a control group, particularly among low- and middle-income countries. Chronic pain is a serious public health problem in terms of human suffering, and in terms of socioeconomic implications. Frequent association with different mental disorders increases disability, decreases quality of life, and makes diagnosis and treatment challenging. The present study aimed to evaluate the presence of mental disorders in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and compare with a control group without pain. Methods We selected 100 patients in a regular follow-up at the Musculoskeletal Pain Outpatient Clinic of the University Hospital and compared them with 100 painless individuals from the control group from June 2016 to June 2018. The instruments used were the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-PLUS) and a structured questionnaire to collect sociodemographic data. Statistical analysis used t-test, chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and multiple logistic regression. Results In the sample evaluated, the majority of patients were women (83%), of brown color (54%), with lower-level education (51%), lower salary range (73%) and high absenteeism rate at work (60,7%). Patients with chronic pain had more psychiatric disorders (88% vs. 48% in the control group; p &lt; 0.001). The most frequent diagnoses were anxiety disorders with panic attacks (44%), generalized anxiety (36%), mixed anxiety and depression disorder (33%), social phobia (30%), agoraphobia (29%), suicide risk (28%), and major depression (27%). Conclusion Positive correlations of mental disorders and chronic musculoskeletal pain have been documented. This suggests that psychiatric components must be taken into account in the management of chronic pain syndromes. The use of Mini Plus as a diagnostic tool for psychiatric disorders can contribute to optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic pain and encourage the creation of policies with strategies and criteria for quick access to Multi-professional Services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases (IMRDs) have been prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination to mitigate the infection severity risks. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at a high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, especially those under immunosuppression or with associated comorbidities. However, few studies have assessed the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with RA. Objective To evaluate the safety of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with RA. Methods This data are from the study “Safety and Efficacy on COVID-19 Vaccine in Rheumatic Diseases,” a Brazilian multicentric prospective phase IV study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine in IMRDs in Brazil. Adverse events (AEs) in patients with RA of all centers were assessed after two doses of ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) or CoronaVac (Sinovac/Butantan). Stratification of postvaccination AEs was performed using a diary, filled out daily and returned at the end of 28 days for each dose. Results A total of 188 patients with RA were include, 90% female. CoronaVac was used in 109 patients and ChAdOx1 in 79. Only mild AEs were observed, mainly after the first dose. The most common AEs after the first dose were pain at the injection (46,7%), headache (39,4%), arthralgia (39,4%), myalgia (30,5%) and fatigue (26,6%), and ChAdOx1 had a higher frequency of pain at the injection (66% vs 32 %, p &lt; 0.001) arthralgia (62% vs 22%, p &lt; 0.001) and myalgia (45% vs 20%, p &lt; 0.001) compared to CoronaVac. The more common AEs after the second dose were pain at the injection (37%), arthralgia (31%), myalgia (23%), headache (21%) and fatigue (18%). Arthralgia (41,4% vs 25%, p = 0.02) and pain at injection (51,4% vs 27%, p = 0.001) were more common with ChAdOx1. No serious AEs were related. With Regard to RA activity level, no significant difference was observed between the three time periods for both COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion In the comparison between the two immunizers in patients with RA, local reactions and musculoskeletal symptoms were more frequent with ChAdOx1 than with CoronaVac, especially after the first dose. In summary, the AE occurred mainly after the first dose, and were mild, like previous data from others immunizing agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Vaccination did not worsen the degree of disease activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patient management in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has evolved to a “treat-to-target” (T2T) approach, which entails intensive treatment and regular follow-up with the goal of achieving low levels of disease activity or clinical remission. Even though a T2T approach is endorsed by professional organizations and yields superior outcomes, its implementation remains incomplete. EVEREST (EleVatE care in RhEumatoid arthritiS with Treat-to-target) is a quality-improvement initiative designed to improve the widespread implementation of a personalized T2T strategy and enable patients with RA to reach their full potential for remission. We describe the Brazilian results from the Global T2T Survey, first part of the EVEREST program. Methods Between June and September 2022, we conducted an online survey targeting rheumatologists in Brazil. Our objective was to evaluate the barriers and knowledge gaps hindering the effective implementation of T2T strategies. To achieve this, we employed a set of multiple-choice questions specifically crafted to elicit responses categorized in a structured order. Results 166 rheumatologists participated in the survey, 51% of them with more than 21 years of experience in rheumatology. Regarding the perceived challenges in the management of RA in clinical practice, the highest percentage of agreement/strong agreement among the participants was related to the contradictory results of disease activity measures (60%). In terms of the main barriers to assess the disease activity in clinical practice, the lack of adherence to treatment and contradictory assessments between patient-reported outcomes and composite measures were indicated by 75% and 59% of the participants, respectively, as a moderate/serious barrier. The most frequently knowledge and skill gaps related to the management of RA pointed out by the participants were on the difficulty to assess patients’ health literacy (54% stated to have no more than intermediate knowledge on standardized methods to assess it and 43% no more than intermediate skills on determining the level of health literacy of the patients). In general, the use of tools to support the management of RA patients in clinical practice was indicated to be unusual by the participants. Self-reflection questionnaires, patient education materials and treatment consideration checklists were pointed out as the least frequently used tools (85%, 64% and 62% of the participants stated to use them never, rarely, or only sometimes, respectively). Conclusions Our findings indicate a greater need for design, selection, and uptake of practical strategies to further improve communication between healthcare providers and patients with RA, as well as for promoting well-informed, collaborative decision-making in their care.",

Pathogenic inflammation is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and elevated serum levels of PGRN has been evaluated as a biomarker of disease activity in SLE. However, the role of PGRN in SLE has not been fully investigated. This study is aimed to determine the potential involvements of PGRN in SLE. Methods Wild type (WT) and PGRN knockout (PGRN -/- ) C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injection of pristane for induction of a murine model of SLE. Sera were collected every biweekly and levels of anti-dsDNA antibody, IgG, and inflammatory factors were measured. Mice were sacrificed 5 months later and the renal lesions, as well as the proportions of T cell subtypes in the spleen were analyzed. Results Following exposure to pristane, PGRN -/- mice generated significantly lower levels of anti-dsDNA antibody and IgG relative to WT mice. PGRN -/- mouse kidneys had less IgG and collagen deposition compared with WT mice after pristane injection. Conclusion The results indicate that PGRN participates in inflammatory response and renal damage in pristane induced SLE models, suggesting that PGRN mediates the onset of SLE.",

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities in the Korean adult population with gout and investigated the association of gout with these comorbidities. Methods Data from 15,935 (weighted n = 39,049,167) participants aged 19 years and older in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2019 to 2021 were used for analysis. Weighted prevalence and odds ratios (OR) of comorbidities in individuals with gout were compared to a non-gout population. Results The weighted prevalence of gout was 2.1% (weighted n = 808,778). Among individuals with gout, 66.5% had metabolic syndrome, 54.9% had hypertension, 41.2% had hypercholesterolemia, 19.1% had diabetes, 13.5% had chronic kidney disease (CKD), 4.1% had myocardial infarction or angina, 3.8% had stroke, and 2.8% had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After adjusting for socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics, gout was independently associated with the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (male OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5–2.8; female OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.5–9.2), hypercholesterolemia (male OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4–2.5; female OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.3–7.5), CKD (male OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.7–7.3; female OR = 11.5, 95% CI: 4.1–32.1), and RA (male OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1–7.1; female OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1–8.7) compared to the non-gout population. Conclusions Gout was associated with several comorbidities, including RA, in both males and females. These results suggest that the prevention and treatment of comorbidities at the individual level, carried out by clinicians, and knowledge of these comorbidities would help guide health policies for the Korean population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The prevalence of Fibromyalgia in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is significantly higher compared to the general population. Despite this frequent association, Fibromyalgia remains underdiagnosed and consequently inadequately treated, negatively affecting the quality of life of these patients. Objective This study aims to evaluate the occurrence of Fibromyalgia and its impact on the quality of life of Brazilian patients with SLE treated at a University Hospital in the state of Paraiba. Materials and methods This descriptive, observational, and cross-sectional study included patients with SLE diagnosed according to the 2012 criteria of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC). The occurrence of Fibromyalgia was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria of 1990 and 2010/2011, revised in 2016. Quality of life was evaluated using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire for all patients, while the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was applied to those diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Results The sample comprised 107 SLE patients, with an average age of 54.1 years (SD:12.1), of whom 95.4% (102) were women. The prevalence of Fibromyalgia among SLE patients was 19.1% (21), all of whom were women with a mean age of 45.6 years (SD 9.6). The SF-36 scores of SLE patients with Fibromyalgia were consistently lower across all eight domains compared to those without Fibromyalgia, indicating a significant negative impact of this comorbidity. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with existing literature, highlighting the significant negative impact of Fibromyalgia on the quality of life of patients with SLE. Conclusion These findings are consistent with existing literature, highlighting the significant negative impact of Fibromyalgia on the quality of life of patients with SLE.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite previous studies indicating a close relationship between immune system and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Methods Genome-wide association data were utilized to explore the causal link between 731 immune cells and AS using a bidirectional two-sample MR approach. The data included immune cell data from Orrù et al.’s study and AS data from the FinnGen consortium. Cochran’s Q test and leave-one-out checked instrument variable (IV) heterogeneity. IVW was the primary method for causal analysis, with MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO addressing horizontal pleiotropy. FDR correction was applied to both analysis directions to rectify multiple testing errors. Results In our study, 22 immune phenotypes out of 731 were casually linked to AS. After excluding 5 less robust features, 17 immune factors remained, with 4 being protective and the rest posing risks. Through FDR correction, we found a significant causal relationship between HLA DR on CD14- CD16+ monocyte and AS (OR (95%CI) = 0.70(0.60 ~ 0.83), P = 2.06*10 −5 ). In the reverse analysis with AS as exposure, potential effects on 34 immune features were discovered. After correction, we confirmed significant causal relationships between AS and two immune features, namely CD20- B cell %lymphocyte (OR (95%CI) = 1.16(1.08–1.25), P = 1.91*10 −5 ) and CD20- B cell %B cell (OR (95%CI) = 1.17(1.09–1.26), P = 1.50*10 −5 ). Conclusions Our study identified various features associated with AS in different types of immune cells. These findings provide important clues and a theoretical basis for further understanding the pathogenesis of AS, guiding clinical treatment, and drug design.",

Baseline 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was determined in patients without history of ASCVD (48-week cohorts). Adverse events (AEs)/AEs of special interest were evaluated/compared with findings from other tofacitinib programs (16 Phase 2/Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis [RA]; 2 Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis [PsA] RCTs) and a real-world cohort of AS patients initiating biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (US MarketScan). Results Most patients (&gt; 75%; 48-week cohorts) without history of ASCVD had low baseline 10-year ASCVD risk. One patient (tofacitinib 5 mg BID; in all 3 cohorts) had a serious infection (aseptic meningitis). Herpes zoster (non-serious) occurred in the 48-week only-tofacitinib 5 mg BID ( n = 5 [1.6%]) and all-tofacitinib ( n = 7 [1.7%]; one multi-dermatomal [tofacitinib 10 mg BID]) cohorts. No deaths, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events, thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal perforations occurred. Limitations: short RCT durations/low patient numbers within cohorts. Conclusion Tofacitinib 5 mg BID was well tolerated to 48 weeks in AS patients; safety profile was consistent with RA/PsA clinical programs and a cohort of AS patients from US routine clinical practice.

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major musculoskeletal disease with high prevalence in the elderly. The study of genetic polymorphisms of inflammatory mediators involved in OA may contribute to the elucidation of the complex pathophysiology of this disease and identification of susceptibility individuals. This study aimed to evaluate the association between polymorphism at tumor necrosis factor alpha gene (SNP - 308 G/A TNFA) with presence, severity and functional status of osteoarthritis in elderly. This study was characterized as case-control and encompassed 257 physically independent elderly (Mean Age: 68.55 ± 5.2; Minimum age: 60 and Maximum age: 82) were recruited. After this selection, the groups were divided in: 92 elderly individuals with osteoarthritis (case group) and 165 without the disease (control group). The individuals were genotyped by the TaqMan real-time PCR system. The subjects were classified based on the degree of radiological impairment according to the criteria of Kellgren-Laurence and regarding functional impairment using the WOMAC and LEQUESNE questionnaires. TNFA gene polymorphic individuals (subjects harboring allele A) are more affected by OA (χ2 = 8.7, p = 0.003), once they have major radiological lesion both in hip (Fisher-Freeman-Halton Test = 3.9, p = 0.04) and knee (Fisher-Freeman-Halton Test = 4.0, p = 0.04) as well as worse functional status assessed by the Lequesne questionnaire (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.04). At the multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, the presence of rare allele for TNFA (allele A) increases the susceptibility to OA development [OR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.1–3.2)]. We conclude that the SNP − 308 G/A of TNFA gene may affect osteoarthritis susceptibility, severity and functional status of individuals with osteoarthritis.",

Its prevalence varies greatly from one study to another according to the population and methodology. Some tools may be helpful in screening for suspected cases. The aim of this study is determine the prevalence of JIA in children and adolescent students in the city of São Paulo, Brazil.This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2016 to November 2017. It was based on a populational study envolving school children and adolescents from São Paulo, the largest city of Brazil. We randomly selected students under 16 years old from private schools with more than 1000 students who were evaluated through a specific questionnaire for screening suspected cases of chronic arthropathy (Early Diagnosis of Chronic Arthritis - 12 items - EDA-12) and subsequent anamnesis and rheumatologic physical examination for diagnostic confirmation.We contacted all 79 schools in the universe, of which 12(15, 18%) agreed to participate in the study. A total of 21,119 questionnaires were handed out to the parents. We obtained a response of 5,710 (27%). In 108 cases the EDA-12 score was considered positive (≥ 5). We examined all these 108 \"suspicious\" children. In 10 cases, the rheumatologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of arthritis, since the subjects presented a history and physical examination compatible with JIA. The prevalence of JIA in children and adolescents was 0.196% (95% CI = 0.104-0.371%).In this first Brazilian population study to evaluate the prevalence of JIA, we observed that the disease is relatively prevalent in our country (196 / 100.000 children), which is similar to that observed in other studies involving children from urban centers.",

Demographic data, gynecological, sexual function, cervical cytology and histological abnormalities were evaluated. JIA clinical/laboratorial parameters and treatment were also assessed. HPV-DNA, CT-DNA and NG-DNA testing in cervical specimens were performed by Hybrid Capture 2 assays.The mean current age was similar in JIA patients and controls (23.3 ± 6.24 vs. 26.1 ± 6.03 years, p = 0.09). The frequencies of sexual intercourse (76% vs. 89%, p = 0.201) and abnormal cervical cytology (24% vs. 11%, p = 0.201) were similar in JIA compared to controls. The higher frequency of HPV infection in JIA patients than controls (30% vs. 11%, p = 0.155) did not reach statistical significance. CT (0% vs. 7%, p = 0.207) and NG infections (0% vs. 4%, p = 0.459) were also alike in both groups. Further evaluation of JIA patients with abnormal and normal cervical cytology showed that the former group had a higher frequency of HPV infection (87% vs. 12%, p = 0.0002) with a low frequency of HPV vaccination (0% vs. 8%, p = 1.0). No differences were evidenced between these two JIA groups regarding demographic data, sexual function and clinical/laboratorial parameters. The frequencies of methotrexate (p = 0.206) and biological agent use (p = 0.238) were similar in both JIA groups.To our knowledge, this was the first study to assess lower genital infections in JIA patients allowing the identification of HPV as main cause of cervical dysplasia. Methotrexate and biological agents do not seem to increase risk of lower genital tract infections in JIA patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by generalized skeletal muscle chronic pain. Its etiology is not well defined, because there are several factors that may trigger it such as physical and/or emotional stresses, or a genetic susceptibility, involving serotonergic, dopaminergic and catecholaminergic paths. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the strength of the lower limb, genetic polymorphism of the serotonin receptor gene HTR 2A in women with fibromyalgia. Methods In this observational study of case-control type 48 women were evaluated who belonged to the group with FM (52 ± 12 years) and 100 women in the control group (58 ± 11 years). Socio demographic and anthropometric data were collected and peripheral blood samples for DNA extraction; genotypic analyzes were performed by means of PCR in real time by TaqMan® system. The lower limb muscle strength was assessed through the test of sitting down and standing up for 30 s. The chi-square test or Fischer Exact was used for possible associations among the variables; the t-test for independent samples was used to compare the averages among the groups; the value of significance adopted was 5%. Results There was an association between the polymorphism of the HTR2A gene with FM, demonstrating that carriers of the genotype GG have 24.39 times more likely to develop the syndrome (IC95% 5.15–115.47; p = 0.01). It was observed an association between FM and the test to sit and stand up demonstrating that women with fibromyalgia have lower limb muscle strength ( p = 0.01). The study showed that the white race has 3.84 times more likely to develop FM (p = 0.01). Conclusion The results of this study suggest that women of Caucasian ethnicity with GG genotype or G allele presented greater risk of developing fibromyalgia and that these patients have lower limb muscle strength compared to the control group.",

Despite evidences demonstrate neuromuscular impairments in RA patients, aging effects may have masked the results of similar previous studies. The aim of study was to verify (i) the effects of RA on functional capacity and muscle properties in middle-aged patients and (ii) the association between age, clinical characteristics, quadriceps muscle properties and functional capacity. Methods Thirty-five RA women and 35 healthy age-matched women were compared with the following outcomes: (i) physical activity level through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); (ii) timed-up and go (TUG) test; (iii) isometric knee extensor muscular strength; and (iv) vastus lateralis muscle activation and muscle architecture (muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length) during an isometric test. An independent Student t-test and partial correlation (controlled by physical activity levels) were performed, with p &lt; 0.05. Results Compared with healthy women, RA presented (i) lower physical activity level (− 29.4%; p &lt; 0.001); (ii) lower isometric knee extensor strength (− 20.5%; p &lt; 0.001); (iii) lower TUG performance (− 21.7%; p &lt; 0.001); (iv) smaller muscle thickness (− 23.3%; p &lt; 0.001) and pennation angle (− 14.1%; p = 0.011). No differences were observed in muscle activation and fascicle length. Finally, the correlation demonstrated that, with exception of TUG, muscle strength and muscle morphology were not associated with age in RA, differently from healthy participants. Conclusion Middle-aged RA patients’ impairments occurred due to the disease independently of the aging process, except for functional capacity. Physical inactivity may have potentiated these losses.",

In children, little is known about the musculoskeletal (MSK) impairment in patients with Pso and its effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).To determine the frequencies of pain and MSK inflammation (i.e., arthritis, enthesitis, and sacroiliitis) among children and adolescents with Pso and its relationship to HRQoL and fatigue.Pediatric patients with Pso underwent a rheumatologic physical examination to evaluate synovitis, enthesalgia, sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain and tender points of fibromyalgia. The core set of domains recommended by the GRAPPA - OMERACT to be measured in PsA studies was assessed. Ultrasound (US) was performed in clinical cases of enthesitis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in cases of SIJ pain.Forty-three participants (10 ± 2.9 years old) were evaluated. Pain on palpation of the entheses was observed in 10 (23.2%) patients and pain on SIJ palpation was observed in 3 (7%). No patient presented with synovitis; one presented with enthesitis on US, but MRI did not confirm sacroiliitis in any case. Patients with MSK pain had greater skin disease severity (PASI 5.4 vs. 2, p < 0.01), worse fatigue, and lower HRQoL scores on all instruments used. The estimated risk of HRQoL impairment was eight times higher in the presence of MSK pain, which was an independent predictive factor. With a NAPSI greater than 30, the probability of pain was greater than 80%.MSK pain is frequent among children with Pso, related to the severity of skin and nail disease, and negatively affects HRQoL. The typically used complementary exams might not detect the inflammatory process caused by Pso.",

This study aimed to investigate if testing antibodies against individual ribosomal protein, but not the common epitope, is required to achieve the best diagnostic benefit in SLE.The study included 82 patients with SLE and 22 healthy donors. Serum antibodies were determined by ELISA and immunoblot.The prevalence of each antibody determined by ELISA was 35.4% (anti-Rib-P), 45.1% (anti-Rib-P0), 32.9% (anti-Rib-P1) and 40.2% (anti-Rib-P2) at 99% specificity, respectively.

The positive rate of anti-Rib-P antibody detected by ELISA was close to the results by immunoblot (33.4%). Patients with any of these antibodies were featured by higher disease activity and prevalence of skin rashes than those with negative antibodies. Moreover, each antibody was particularly related to some clinical and laboratory disorders. The distribution of subclasses of IgG1-4 was varied with each antibody. Anti-Rib-P0 IgG1 and IgG3 were strongly correlated with disease activity and lower serum complement components 3 and 4.Anti-Rib-P antibody is not adequate to predict the existence of antibodies against ribosomal P0, P1 and P2 protein.

Such patients often seek information online, for the purpose of gaining a second opinion to their healthcare provider or even self-medication. Little is known about the quality of web-based consumer health information at the intersection of CAM and arthritis; thus, investigating the quality of websites containing this information was the purpose of this study. Methods Four unique search terms were searched on Google across four English-speaking countries. We assessed the first 20 results of each search, including them if they contained CAM consumer health information for the treatment and/or management of arthritis. Eligible websites were assessed in duplicate using the DISCERN instrument, which consists of 16-items designed to assess quality. Results Of total of 320 webpages, 239 were duplicates, and a total of 38 unique websites were deemed eligible and assessed using the DISCERN instrument. The mean summed DISCERN scores across all websites was 55.53 (SD = 9.37). The mean score of the overall quality of each website was 3.71 (SD = 0.63), thus the majority of websites are ranked as slightly above ‘fair’ quality. Conclusion Eligible websites generally received scores better than ‘moderate’ in terms of overall quality. Several shortcomings included a lack of transparency surrounding references used and underreporting of risks associated with treatment options. These results suggest that health providers should be vigilant of the variable quality of information their patients may be accessing online and educate them on how to identify high quality resources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal symptoms, primarily attributed to sensitization of somatosensory system carrying pain. Few reports have investigated the impact of fibromyalgia symptoms on cognition, corticomotor excitability, sleepiness, and the sleep quality — all of which can deteriorate the quality of life in fibromyalgia. However, the existing reports are underpowered and have conflicting directions of findings, limiting their generalizability. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare measures of cognition, corticomotor excitability, sleepiness, and sleep quality using standardized instruments in the recruited patients of fibromyalgia with pain-free controls. Methods Diagnosed cases of fibromyalgia were recruited from the Rheumatology department for the cross-sectional, case-control study. Cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination, Stroop color-word task), corticomotor excitability (Resting motor threshold, Motor evoked potential amplitude), daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index) were studied according to the standard procedure. Results Thirty-four patients of fibromyalgia and 30 pain-free controls were recruited for the study. Patients of fibromyalgia showed decreased cognitive scores ( p = 0.05), lowered accuracy in Stroop color-word task (for color: 0.02, for word: 0.01), and prolonged reaction time (&lt; 0.01, &lt; 0.01). Excessive daytime sleepiness in patients were found (&lt; 0.01) and worsened sleep quality (&lt; 0.01) were found. Parameters of corticomotor excitability were comparable between patients of fibromyalgia and pain-free controls. Conclusions Patients of fibromyalgia made more errors, had significantly increased reaction time for cognitive tasks, marked daytime sleepiness, and impaired quality of sleep. Future treatment strategies may include cognitive deficits and sleep disturbances as an integral part of fibromyalgia management.",

Herein, we intend to explore the function and molecular mechanism of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in CHON-001 cells. Methods Relative expression of KCNQ1OT1, miR-126-5p and TRPS1 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. The migratory ability of chondrocytes was assessed by transwell assay. Western blot was used to determine relative protein expression of collagen II, MMP13 and TRPS1. Dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay was applied to test the target of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 or miR-126-5p. Results Relative expression of KCNQ1OT1 and TRPS1 was reduced, whereas miR-126-5p was augmented in cartilage tissues of post-traumatic OA patients compared to those of subjects without post-traumatic OA. Increased KCNQ1OT1 or decreased miR-126-5p enhanced cell viability and migration, and repressed extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in CHON-001 cells. MiR-126-5p was the downstream target of KCNQ1OT1, and it could directly target TRPS1. There was an inverse correlation between KCNQ1OT1 and miR-126-5p or between miR-126-5p and TRPS1. Meantime, there was a positive correlation between KCNQ1OT1 and TRPS1. The promoting impacts of KCNQ1OT1 on cell viability and migration as well as the suppressive impact of KCNQ1OT1 on ECM degradation were partially abolished by miR-126-5p overexpression or TRPS1 knockdown in CHON-001 cells. Conclusions Overexpression of KCNQ1OT1 attenuates the development of OA by sponging miR-126-5p to target TRPS1. Our findings may provide a possible therapeutic strategy for human OA in clinic.",

Sacroiliitis can be observed in some FMF patients. This study aimed to compare the demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings, and treatment in children with FMF and sacroiliitis, and children with juvenile spondyloarthropathy (JSpA). Methods In total, 1687 pediatric FMF patients that were followed-up between May 2010 and June 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Among them, those with sacroiliitis ( n = 63) were included in the study and compared to patients with JSpA ( n = 102). Results The study included 63 FMF patients with sacroiliitis (38 males [60.3%] and 25 females [39.7%]) with a mean age of 15.2 ± 4.1 years. Mean age at symptom onset was 7.2 ± 5.05 years and mean age at diagnosis was 9.74 ± 4.67 years. The most common mutation in the FMF patients was M694V/M694V ( n = 22). Patients were diagnosed with sacroiliitis with a mean of 12 months (range: 6–36 months) after the diagnosis of FMF. Among the FMF patients, 28 (44.4%) had enthesitis, 23 (36.5%) had heel pain, and 11 (17.4%) had low back pain. The study also included 102 JSpA patients (90 males [88.2%] and 12 females [11.8%]). Mean age of patients with JSpA was 16.1 ± 2.8 years. As compared to 102 JSpA patients, patients with FMF and sacroiliitis had higher acute phase reactants, whereas HLA-B27 positivity rate was lower. In addition, axial involvement rate was higher in the JSpA patients. Conclusion Sacroiliitis is a common co-morbidity in FMF patients.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate YKL-40 serum levels; correlate them with laboratory and clinical parameters, disease status, and treatment schemes; and analyze the YKL-40 expression in the muscle tissues of patients with antisynthetase syndrome (ASSD). Methods This cross-sectional single-center study included 64 adult patients with ASSD who were age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched to 64 healthy control individuals. Their YKL-40 serum levels were analyzed using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit method, while YKL-40 expression in muscle tissues was analyzed using an immunohistochemical technique. Disease status was assessed using the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) set scores. Results The patients’ mean age was 44.8 ± 11.8 years, and median disease duration was 1.5 (0.0–4.0) years. These patients were predominantly female (82.8%) and Caucasian (73.4%). Most patients had stable disease. The median YKL-40 serum level was significantly higher in patients with ASSD when compared to the healthy individuals: 538.4 (363.4–853.1) pg/mL versus 270.0 (201.8–451.9) pg/mL, respectively; P &lt; 0.001.

However, the recommendation of low dose short-term monotherapy with (GCs) remains open to the discretion of the clinician. The aim of this study was to assess whether a short-term use of low dose prednisone monotherapy was effective in inducing remission in newly diagnosed RA patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients newly diagnosed with RA at a Community Health Center in North Dakota was performed based on the ACR/EULAR RA classification criteria. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from patients’ medical charts. Patients treated with ( &lt; 10 mg/day) of prednisone up to 6 months were included. Response to prednisone was analyzed according to pre- and post-treatment DAS28-ESR score and EULAR response criteria. Results Data on 201 patients were analyzed. The mean prednisone dose was 8 mg/day (range: 5–10; SD = 1.2) and the mean treatment duration was 42.2 days (12–177; 16.9). Disease severity significantly improved from baseline to follow-up for: tender joint count (8.6 ± 4.8 vs. 1.5 ± 3.3; P &lt; 0.001), swollen joint count (6.2 ± 5.0 vs. 1.4 ± 3.0; P &lt; 0.001), and visual analog pain score (4.8 ± 2.6 vs. 2.1 ± 2.5; P &lt; 0.001). DAS28-ESR disease severity significantly improved from baseline to follow-up: (5.1 ± 1.2 vs. 2.7 ± 1.3; P &lt; 0.001). Per EULAR response criteria, 69.7% of patients showed good response to treatment and 20.4% showed moderate response. 54.2% of patients reached remission. Conclusion Short-term use of low dose prednisone monotherapy induced disease remission and improved clinical severity of RA in the majority of newly diagnosed patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and autoimmune systemic inflammatory disease that can cause irreversible joint deformities, with increased morbidity and mortality and a significant impact on the quality of life of the affected individual. The main objective of RA treatment is to achieve sustained clinical remission or low disease activity. However, up to 40% of patients do not respond to available treatments, including bDMARDs. New therapeutic targets for RA are emerging, such as Janus kinases (JAKs). These are essential for intracellular signaling (via JAK-STAT) in response to many cytokines involved in RA immunopathogenesis. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have established themselves as a highly effective treatment, gaining increasing space in the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of RA. The current recommendations aim to present a review of the main aspects related to the efficacy and safety of JAKis in RA patients, and to update the recommendations and treatment algorithm proposed by the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology in 2017.",

    "abstract": "The VI Brazilian Consensus on Autoantibodies against HEp-2 cells for determination of autoantibodies against cellular constituents on HEp-2 cells was held on September, 2019, in Fortaleza (CE, Brazil). The guidelines in this edition were formulated by the group of Brazilian experts discussing the classification of complex patterns, the classification of the nuclear discrete dots (few and multiple), the identification of the discrete fine speckled pattern (AC-4a) and improvements on the ANA report.Sixteen Brazilian researchers and experts from universities and clinical laboratories representing the various geographical regions of Brazil participated in the meeting. Four main topics were discussed: (1) How to classify patterns with fluorescence in more than one cell compartment considering three relevant categoris: composite patterns, mixed patterns and multiple patterns; (2) The splitting of the discrete nuclear dots pattern into the multiple discrete nuclear dots (AC-6) and few discrete nuclear dots (AC-7) patterns, respectively; (3) Inclusion of a novel nuclear pattern characterized by discrete fine speckled pattern highly associated with antibodies to SS-A/Ro60, classified as AC-4a. In addition, adjustments on the Brazilian Consensus nomenclature were implemented aiming to harmonize the designation of some patterns with the International Consensus on ANA Patterns (ICAP). Furthermore, the designations of the PCNA-like pattern (AC-13), CENP-F-like pattern (AC-14) and Topo I-like pattern (AC-29) were adjusted in accordance to ICAP. Finally, there was a recommendation for adjustment in the test report in order to address the status of nuclear envelope staining. For all topics, the aim was to establish specific guidelines for laboratories and clinicians. All recommendations were based on consensus among participants. All recommendations from the V Consensus were maintained and there was relevant progress in the BCA/HEp-2 guidelines and further harmonization with ICAP.The VI BCA/HEp-2 edition was successful in establishing important recommendations regarding the classification of complex patterns, in supporting the identification of a novel pattern within the AC-4 group and in the harmonization process with the ICAP terminology.",

Up to this moment there is no consensus for the treatment of DADA2 and anti-TNF is the therapy of choice for chronic management whereas bone marrow transplantation is considered for refractory or severe phenotypes. Data from Brazil is scarce and this multicentric study reports 18 patients with DADA2 from Brazil. Patients and methods This is a multicentric study proposed by the Center for Rare and Immunological Disorders of the Hospital 9 de Julho - DASA, São Paulo - Brazil. Patients of any age with a confirmed diagnosis of DADA2 were eligible for this project and data on clinical, laboratory, genetics and treatment were collected. Results Eighteen patients from 10 different centers are reported here. All patients had disease onset at the pediatric age (median of 5 years) and most of them from the state of São Paulo. Vasculopathy with recurrent stroke was the most common phenotype but atypical phenotypes compatible with ALPS-like and Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) was also found. All patients carried pathogenic mutations in the ADA2 gene. Acute management of vasculitis was not satisfactory with steroids in many patients and all those who used anti-TNF had favorable responses. Conclusion The low number of patients diagnosed with DADA2 in Brazil reinforces the need for disease awareness for this condition. Moreover, the absence of guidelines for diagnosis and management is also necessary (t).",

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammation, documented before rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis, is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. We aimed to compare the prevalence of carotid plaque (CP) in RA patients in the first five years since diagnosis and healthy controls, and to determine disease characteristics associated with the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in RA patients.This was a cross-sectional study. We recruited 60 RA patients in the first five years since diagnosis and 60 matched healthy controls. Carotid ultrasound was performed to detect the presence of CP and measure carotid-intima media thickness (cIMT). Subclinical atherosclerosis was considered as the presence of CP and/or increased cIMT. Distribution was evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparisons were made with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables and Student's t or Mann-Whitney's U test for quantitative variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.There were no differences in the demographic characteristics between RA patients and controls. The mean disease duration was 2.66 ± 1.39 years. A higher prevalence of CP (30.0% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.013), bilateral CP (18.3% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.008), increased cIMT (30.0% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.001), and subclinical atherosclerosis (53.3% vs. 18.3%, p = < 0.001) was found in RA patients. RA patients with subclinical atherosclerosis were older (56.70 years vs. 50.00 years, p = 0.002), presented a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia (53.1% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.002), and higher prevalence of classification in moderate-high disease activity category measured by DAS28-CRP (68.8% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.010). The latter variable persisted independently associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in the binary logistic regression (OR 6.11, 95% CI 1.51-24.70, p = 0.011).In the first five years since diagnosis, higher prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis, including CP was found in RA patients. Carotid ultrasound should be considered part of the systematic CVR evaluation of RA at the time of diagnosis.",

As genetic polymorphisms may cause changes in protein levels and functions, we investigated associations of TP53 and p21 ( CDKN1A ) polymorphisms ( p53 72 G &gt; C—rs1042522; p53 PIN3—rs17878362; p21 31 C &gt; A—rs1801270; p21 70 C &gt; T—rs1059234) with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Southeastern Brazilian population. Methods Genotyping of 353 female volunteers (cases, n = 145; controls, n = 208) was performed by polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism and/or DNA sequencing. Associations between TP53 and p21 polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility and clinical manifestations of SLE patients were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Results Protective effect was observed for the genotype combinations p53 PIN3 A1/A1- p21 31 C/A, in the total study population (OR 0.45), and p53 PIN3 A1/A2- p21 31 C/C, in non-white women (OR 0.28). In Whites, p53 72 C-containing (OR 3.06) and p53 PIN3 A2-containing (OR 6.93) genotypes were associated with SLE risk, and higher OR value was observed for the combined genotype p53 72 G/C- p53 PIN3 A1/A2 (OR 9.00). Further, p53 PIN3 A1/A2 genotype was associated with serositis (OR 2.82), while p53 PIN3 A2/A2 and p53 72 C/C genotypes were associated with neurological disorders (OR 4.69 and OR 3.34, respectively). Conclusions Our findings showed that the TP53 and p21 polymorphisms included in this study may have potential to emerge as SLE susceptibility markers for specific groups of patients. Significant interactions of the TP53 polymorphisms with serositis and neurological disorders were also observed in SLE patients.",

Methods This retrospective study recruited 179 RA patients treated with BARI (2–4 mg/d) or TOFA (10 mg/d) at The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from September 2019 to January 2022. The rate of low disease activity (LDA) was used as the primary end point. Secondary end points included the Disease Activity Scale-28 (DAS-28)-C-reactive protein (CRP); the rate of DAS28-CRP remission; visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, swollen joint, and tender joint counts; and adverse events at the 6-month follow-up. Several factors affecting LDA achievement were also analyzed. Results Seventy-four patients were treated with BARI and 105 were treated with TOFA, including 83.24% females, with a median (IQR) age of 56.0 (53.0–56.0) years old and disease duration of 12.0 (6.0–12.0) months. There was no difference of the rate of LDA between the BARI and TOFA treatment groups. All disease indices in the two groups were significantly improved, including a significantly lower VAS in the BARI group ( P &lt; 0.05), reflecting the drug efficacy after 1 and 6 months of treatment. The incidence of adverse reactions was similar in these two groups. Conclusion The treatment efficacy and safety of BARI and TOFA in the RA patients were similar, but BARI was more effective in pain relief than TOFA. An older baseline age was more likely to achieve LDA in the BARI group, while a low baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was more likely to achieve LDA in the TOFA group.",

Therefore, the aims of the present study were: (a) to analyze systematically and simultaneously serum levels of angiogenin (ANG), angiopoietin (ANGPT)-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 and - 2, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and -BB in DM; (b) to correlate the serum level of these cytokines with the DM clinical and laboratory features.This is a cross sectional study, in which 48 patients with DM aged 18 to 45 years were gender-, age- and ethnicity-matched with 48 healthy individuals (control group). The serum levels of cytokines analyses were performed by multiplex immunoassay. The parameters of DM activity were based on the scores established by the International Myositis Assessment & Clinical Studies Group.The mean ages, gender frequencies and ethnicities were comparable between the patients with DM and the control group. A significantly higher serum FGF-1 and FGF-2 levels (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), lower VEGF and PDGF-AA levels (P = 0.009 and P = 0.022), and comparable ANG, ANGPT-1 and PDGF-BB levels were observed in DM patients compared to controls. There was a tendency for cytokines (with the exceptions of VEGF and PDGF-BB) to correlate positively with the DM activity parameters, whereas FGF-2 correlated inversely. Moreover, FGF-1 strongly correlated with DM cutaneous manifestations.The present data provide the relevance of different serum angiogenic cytokines in patients with DM.

This study examines how the socioeconomic condition of the patient with RA in Brazil, assessed according to social class, educational level, employment situation and use of caregivers, affects the times between the beginning of symptoms and diagnosis and the beginning of the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, as well as the presence of erosive disease and functional status. Methods This work is part of a multicentric study called REAL - Rheumatoid Arthritis in Real Life in Brazil, which is a prospective observational cohort study. Results As described in the REAL study, we included a total of 1115 patients. It was noted that patients with an educational classification of up to second grade incomplete presented with erosion percentages above those with a higher grade complete. Patients with caregivers presented a higher percentage of erosion than patients without caregivers. We verified that patients from economic classes above B2 presented fewer occurrences of erosion than those from classes C2, D-E. We also analyzed the average time differences from the beginning of symptoms and diagnosis and the beginning of treatment, according to academic level, erosion and economic classification. Patients with first grade complete showed an HAQ-DI averages higher than those with second grade complete. The patients who had employment showed lower HAQ-DI averages than patients who were not employed. The patients with erosion showed an HAQ-DI value higher than those without erosion. Patients with caregivers showed an HAQ-DI average higher than that of without caregivers. Conclusion This study showed that the therapeutic window of RA is not being reached, and therefore we should have a policy to expand and ensure access to public health for all patients, especially those with lower levels of education and income. Trial registration This study was approved by the National Commission of Ethics in Research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The term Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) refers to a group of drugs that inhibit factor Xa or thrombin. Even though their use for treating different thrombotic or prothrombotic conditions is increasing recently, there is no compelling evidence indicating that those medications are safe in all antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. Methodology To address this issue, specialists from the Antiphospholipid Syndrome Committee of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology performed a comprehensive review of the literature regarding DOACs use in APS to answer the three following questions: (1) potential mechanisms of action of these drugs that could be relevant to APS pathogenesis, (2) DOACs interference on lupus anticoagulant testing, and (3) the efficacy of DOACs in APS. Position statement After critically reviewing the relevant evidence, the authors formulated 8 Position Statements about DOACs use in APS. Conclusion DOACs should not be routinely used in APS patients, especially in those with a high-risk profile (triple positivity to aPL, arterial thrombosis, and recurrent thrombotic events). In addition, DOACs interferes with LA testing, leading to false-positive results in patients investigating APS.",

Methods In this multicenter, randomized, single-blind trial, 627 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA)—Kellgren-Lawrence grades 2 or 3 and mean score ≥ 40 mm in the WOMAC pain subscale—were randomized to receive GS/CS or the RP for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in WOMAC pain subscale score. The secondary endpoints included the following: WOMAC total and subscale scores, overall assessment of the disease by the patient and the investigator, SF-12 score, OMERACT-OARSI response rate to the treatment, and rescue medication use. Results Mean reductions of WOMAC pain score were − 35.1 (sd = 23.2) mm in the GS/CS group and − 36.5 (sd = 24.9) mm in the RP group. The difference between the adjusted means of both treatments confirmed the non-inferiority of GS/CS versus the RP. Improvement was observed in pain, stiffness, physical function and total WOMAC score, as well as in overall OA assessment by the patient and the investigator for both groups. No improvement was observed in SF-12. The rate of OMERACT-OARSI responders was 89.4% in GS/CS group and 87.9% in the RP group. Headache and changes in glucose tolerance were the most frequent treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions The new formulation of a fixed-dose combination of glucosamine sulfate and bovine chondroitin sulfate was non-inferior to the RP in symptomatic treatment of knee OA, with a high responder rate and good tolerability profile.

Current findings regarding plasma/serum homocysteine (HCY) levels in AS patients are inconsistent. This study aims to systematically evaluate the association between circulating HCY levels and AS. Methods Online electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang data) were used to retrieve all relevant articles published up to May 7, 2020. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effect model, Stata16 software. Results Nine articles containing 778 AS patients and 522 controls were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences in HCY levels were found between AS and control groups (pooled SMD = 0.46, 95% CI = − 0.30 to 1.23, P = 0.23). However, subgroup analysis suggested that HCY levels were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) in the AS group treated with methotrexate (MTX) compared with the control group. In contrast, HCY levels were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) lower in the AS group receiving anti-TNF-α treatment compared with the control group. No significant differences were detected between HCY levels and disease activity scores (Bath AS disease activity index, BASDAI), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype. Conclusion This meta-analysis indicates that HCY levels are similar between AS and controls, and do not correlate with disease activity. However, different medical treatments cause fluctuations of circulating HCY levels in AS patients. Further and larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); fatigue by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS); daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); and depressive symptoms by the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). RA activity was measured by the disease activity score (DAS28).One hundred ten women (mean age ± SD = 51.1 ± 13.0 y) were included in the study. On average, patients with depressive symptoms (BDI-II > 13), as compared to those without, showed poorer sleep quality (PSQI: 10.09 ± 4.1 vs 7.33 ± 3.55; p = 0.001 respectively), more fatigue (FSS: 4.69 ± 1.89 vs 3.34 ± 1.8; p = 0.001) and higher disease activity level (DAS28: 4.36 ± 1.53 vs 3.7 ± 1.39; p = 0,047). The logistic regression analysis showed that sleep quality is an independent predictor of depressive symptom severity.Depressive symptoms, impaired sleep and fatigue are common in women with RA. Poor sleep is associated with greater frequency and severity of depressive symptoms in these patients, suggesting that screening for sleep and mood problems may be relevant both in clinical research and routine patient care. Future studies investigating the impact of measures to promote healthy sleep on depressive symptom control in this patient population are warranted.",

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) classifies FMS as chronic primary pain, and it can negatively impact individuals' functioning including social, psychological, physical and work-related factors. Notably, while guidelines recommend a biopsychosocial approach for managing chronic pain conditions, FMS assessment remains clinical. The WHODAS 2.0 is a unified scale to measure disability in the light of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Brazilian version of WHODAS 2.0 for use in individuals with FMS.Methodological study of the validity and reliability of the Brazilian version of the 36-item WHODAS 2.0 with 110 individuals with FMS.

Patients and methods To raise awareness for rheumatic diseases, a mobile rheumatology office was deployed in different cities of Germany (“Rheuma-Truck”). Standardized questionnaire assessment, testing for rheumatoid factor and citrullinated peptide antibodies and medical student driven MSUS of the clinically dominant hand/foot including wrist, MCP-II, -III, -V, PIP-II, -III, MTP-II and -V were offered free of charge to the population. In case of suspicious results, a rheumatologist was consulted. Results In MSUS, 192 of 560 selected volunteers (aged 18–89, mean 52.7 years; 72.9% female) had suspicious findings including synovitis or erosions primarily affecting the MTP-II (11.8%), dorsal wrist (8.9%), and MCP-II (7%). 354 of the 560 volunteers further visited a rheumatologist of whom 76 were diagnosed with RA. According to the ‘US7 Score’, a sum scores ≥ 5 was significantly predictive for RA (odds ratio (OR) 5.06; confidence interval (CI) 0.83–35.32). 313 volunteers displayed signs of OA including osteophytes, while MCP-II (36.2%), MCP-III (14.8%), and the wrist (10.5%) were mostly affected. Diagnosis of RA was favoured over OA if the wrist (OR 4.2; CI 1.28–13.95), MTP-II (OR 1.62; CI 1.0–2.6), and MCP-V (OR 2.0; CI 1.0–3.8) were involved. Conclusion Medical student driven MSUS by the ‘US7 Score’ can facilitate diagnosis of RA in rheumatology-screening programs due to the level of the score and the affected joints. A high rate of unknown OA signs was detected by MSUS. A mobile rheumatology office displays an opportunity to screen patients for RA and OA.",

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical-biological characteristics and response to treatment of a case series and to provide a comprehensive literature review on cGVHD related EF involvement. Methods Prospective observational study to describe the clinical and diagnostic evaluation characteristics of patients with EF-like follow-up as part of our multidisciplinary cGVHD consultations. In addition, the literature on joint and/or fascial musculoskeletal manifestations due to cGVHD was comprehensively reviewed. Results 118 patients were evaluated in multidisciplinary cGVHD consultations, 39 of whom (33%) developed fasciitis. Notably, 11 patients had isolated joint contractures without sclerotic skin. After a median of three lines of treatment, the vast majority of patients achieved some degree of response. 94 potentially eligible articles were identified by the search strategy, with 17 of them, the majority isolated case reports, making the final selection. The validated staging scales used for the assessment were the Joint and Fascial Score and the Photographic Range of Motion. Conclusion Fascial/articular involvement needs to be recognized and evaluated early. To our knowledge, our cohort is the second largest series to have been reported.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Currently, only a few retrospective cohort or cross-sectional studies have described the general characteristics of Brazilian patients with classical dermatomyositis (DM). In contrast, we aimed to longitudinally assess a large sample of these patients, and several myositis autoantibodies. Methods This single-center longitudinal study included 91 Brazilian adults with defined DM (EULAR/ACR 2017) who underwent follow-up appointments in our tertiary center from 2012 to 2021. Myositis autoantibody analysis was performed using a commercial kit. Results The mean age of the patients was 47.3 ± 15.4 years, with a predominance of female (67.0%) and White (81.3%) patients. As an initial treatment, 76.9% of the patients received methylprednisolone pulse therapy, 59.3% received intravenous immunoglobulin, and 54.9% received both drugs. The median follow-up duration was 44 months (interquartile 17–67) months. There were 92 severe episodes of infection, and neoplasms were identified in 20 patients (22.0%). Hypertension was identified in 46.2% of patients, whereas diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction occurred in 19.8% and 4.4%, respectively. Nine patients died during the follow-up. At the last visit, one-third of the patients had disease activity, half had a complete clinical response, and one-fifth were in disease remission. In a univariate logistic regression, anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies (n = 13) were associated with interstitial lung disease, “mechanic’s hands”, and anti-Ro-52, and had an inverse association with “V”-neck and “shawl” signs. Anti-MDA-5 (n = 10) were associated with male gender, digital ulcers, vasculitis, arthritis, anti-Ro-52, and active disease. Anti-Ro-52 (n = 26) were associated with “mechanics’ hands”, arthritis, interstitial lung disease, anti-tRNA synthetases, and anti-MDA-5. No association was found for anti-Mi-2 (n = 10). Conclusions This study shows the general profile of a significant sample of Brazilian patients with DM as well as the association of some antibodies with clinical and laboratory manifestations of this myositis.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by peripheral and symmetrical polyarthritis. It can be divided into Very Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (VERA) diagnosed up to 3 months of symptoms and late onset (Late Early Rheumatoid Arthritis – LERA), diagnosed between 3 and 12 months. Currently, it is recommended to evaluate the patient with joint symptoms as early as possible, and the first 12 weeks of manifestations represent the ideal phase for the diagnosis, favoring a better evolution of the treatment. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, mean time of diagnosis and to determine possible associated factors in the municipality of Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil. A cross-sectional study using the 1987 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria to select patients attended at primary or secondary health care units in Blumenau, Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, in 2014. Diagnostic time was verified by self-report of the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis made by a rheumatologist. To test the associations, the chi-square test, the Wald linear trend test and the Poisson regression analysis were used. The mean time of diagnosis was 28 months. The prevalence of diagnosis up to 3 and 12 months was 27.7% and 64.8%, respectively. Obesity was associated with time diagnosis in both periods. The 0–4 years category of the variable education was associated only with the period up to 12 months. The mean time of diagnosis was similar to the national context. Among socioeconomic factors, lower education was associated with the diagnosis of late onset RA. The anthropometric variable presented a progressive increase in the prevalence due to the longer time to diagnosis.",

All participants performed hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and answered a detailed questionnaire about the presence of clinical risk factors (CRFs) related to low BMD and risk fractures. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were used to define obesity.Age-adjusted osteoporosis prevalence was 20.8, 33.6, 47 and 67.1% in obese, overweight, normal and underweight category, respectively. Obesity was present in 29,6% (1.830 women) in the study population and the likelihood of osteoporosis and low-impact Fx compared to a normal BMI in this subgroup was of 0.24 (95% CI 0.20-0.28; p < 0.001) and of 1.68 (95% CI 1.35-2.11; p < 0.001), respectively. However, the hip Fx likelihood was lower in obese compared with non-obese women (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.20-0.97). Using an originally validated cut-off, the SAPORI tool sensitivity was significantly hampered in overweight and obese women although the accuracy had remained suitable because of increasing in specificity.The osteoporosis prevalence reduced as BMI increased and obesity was associated with low-impact Fx, regardless of the BMD measurements. Moreover, the SAPORI performance was impaired in obese women.",

Experimental studies showed that animal models immunized with collagen type V developed a disease similar to human systemic sclerosis (SSc), with antibodies production, mainly in early stages post-immunization. Eighty-one female SSc patients were included and divided into two groups: early-SSc (18 patients-EULAR Preliminary Criteria) and defined-SSc (63 patients-ACR Criteria 1980). The control group consisted of 19 healthy women age-matched to Early-SSc group. Anti-collagen type V was performed by ELISA. Data was analyzed by appropriate tests. The prevalence of anti-collagen type V in early-SSc, defined-SSc and control groups was respectively 33, 17 and 5% (p = 0.07). SSc patients with anti-collagen type V had shorter disease duration compared to those without this antibody (8.8 ± 5.1 vs. 14.7 ± 8.9, p = 0.006). Likewise, early-SSc patients with anti-collagen V also had a shorter disease duration than patients negative for this antibody (4.6 ± 2.2 vs. 9.7 ± 5.2, p = 0.04). No association with clinical subsets or scleroderma antibodies specificities was observed (p > 0.05). The production of anti-collagen type V in SSc seems to be an early event independent of other antibodies specificities.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are described in individuals with leprosy without the clinical features of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), a condition involving thromboembolic phenomena. We have described the persistence of these antibodies for over 5 years in patients with leprosy after specific treatment. Objectives To determine whether epidemiological, clinical and immunological factors played a role in the long-term persistence of aPL antibodies in leprosy patients after multidrug therapy (MDT) had finished. Methods The study sample consisted of 38 patients with a diagnosis of leprosy being followed up at the Dermatology and Venereology Outpatient Department at the Alfredo da Matta Foundation (FUAM) in Manaus, AM. ELISA was used to detect anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β 2 glycoprotein I (anti - β 2 GPI) antibodies. Patients were reassessed on average of 5 years after specific treatment for the disease (MDT) had been completed. Results Persistence of aPL antibodies among the 38 leprosy patients was 84% (32/38), and all had the IgM isotype. Mean age was 48.1 ± 15.9 years, and 23 (72.0%) were male. The lepromatous form (LL) of leprosy was the most common ( n = 16, 50%). Reactional episodes were observed in three patients (9.4%). Eighteen (47.37%) were still taking medication (prednisone and/or thalidomide). Mean IgM levels were 64 U/mL for aCL and 62 U/mL for anti-β 2 GPI. In the multivariate binary logistic regression the following variables showed a significant association: age ( p = 0.045, OR = 0.91 and CI 95% 0.82–0.98), LL clinical presention ( p = 0.034; OR = 0.02 and CI 95% = 0.0–0.76) and bacterial index ( p = 0.044; OR = 2.74 and CI 95% = 1.03–7.33). We did not find association between prednisone or thalidomide doses and positivity for aPL ( p = 0.504 and p = 0.670, respectively). No differences in the variables vascular thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, diabetes, smoking and alcoholism were found between aPL-positive and aPL-negative patients. Conclusion Persistence of positivity for aPL antibodies was influenced by age, clinical presentation and bacterial index. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the reason for this persistence, the role played by aPL antibodies in the disease and the B cell lineages responsible for generation of these antibodies.",

Patients were included since 2011 according to the classification criteria for FM of the American College of Rheumatology of 1990 (ACR1990). Objective To analyze the therapeutic measures prescribed by Brazilian physicians. Materials and methods Cross-sectional study of a multicenter cohort. The therapeutic measures were described using descriptive statistics. Results We analyzed 456 patients who had complete data in the registry. The mean age was 54.0 ± 11.9 years; 448 were women (98.2%). Almost all patients (98.4%) used medications, 62.7% received health education, and less than half reported practicing physical exercise; these modalities were often used in combination. Most patients who practiced exercises practiced aerobic exercise only, and a significant portion of patients combined it with flexibility exercises. The most commonly used medication was amitriptyline, followed by cyclobenzaprine, and a minority used medication specifically approved for FM, such as duloxetine and pregabalin, either alone or in combination. Combinations of two or three medications were observed, with the combination of fluoxetine and amitriptyline being the most frequent (18.8%). Conclusion In this evaluation of the care of patients with FM in Brazil, it was found that the majority of patients are treated with a combination of pharmacological measures. Non-pharmacological methods are underused, with aerobic exercise being the most commonly practiced exercise type. The most commonly prescribed single drug was amitriptyline, and the most commonly prescribed combination was fluoxetine and amitriptyline. Drugs specifically approved for FM are seldom prescribed.",

Despite the efficacy demonstrated in controlled trials this information needs to be confirmed by real life data. This study assessed real-life treatment among RA patients. Methods REAL study included Brazilian RA patients from eleven centers. Interview and medical records were performed. Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t or Mann-Whitney and categorical variables were assessed with chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Results 1115 patients were included, women 89.5%. Median age 56.6 years, disease duration 152.5 months; 78.7% were rheumatoid fator positive; 55.2% had erosive disease; DAS28 (disease activity index-28 joints) = 3.5, HAQ (health assessment questionnaire) =0.875. The median duration of symptoms until the start of first DMARD was 12 months. A total of 529 (47.2%) patients used corticosteroids; 1022 (90.8%) were on conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs and 406 (36.1%) on biological (b) DMARDs. Methotrexate (MTX) was the most frequent csDMARD: 748 (66.5%) patients, followed by leflunomide (LFN), used by 381 (33.9%) of patients. MTX was associated to LFN in 142 (12.6%) patients. Only five (0.4%) patients used triple therapy (MTX + hydroxychloroquine + sulfasalazine) or sulfasalazine in monotherapy. Conclusions Despite advances in therapeutic resources, roughly half RA patients failed achieve T2T goals and 55.2% developed erosive disease. The frequent use of corticosteroids and delay in initiating DMARDs were demonstrated. Issues concerning timely access to medical care are crucial for effective management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The current diagnostic cornerstone for septic arthritis contains gram stains, bacterial culture, and cell count with a differential of aspirated synovial fluid. Recently, a synovial leukocyte esterase (LE) test has been used for diagnosing septic arthritis. Since this test measures the esterase activity of leukocytes, there is always a dilemma for using this test in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Methods We collected the synovial fluid specimens as part of the general diagnostic protocol for patients suspected of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) or Septic Arthritis (SA). Each group included 34 patients. We compared the result of the synovial LE test with the result of the culture of each patient. Results The mean ages of patients were 64.14 ± 31.27 and 50.88 ± 23.19 months in the JIA group and septic arthritis group, respectively. The LE test results were positive in 30 specimens, trace in 3 and negative in one in the first-time test and were positive in 31 specimens and trace in 3 in the second-time test, while it was negative in all patients with JIA. Hence, the sensitivity of the synovial LE test was 80.8%, the specificity, PPV, and NPV were 78.6, 70.0, 86.8% respectively based on a positive culture. Conclusion The leukocyte esterase strip test can be used as a rapid, bedside method for diagnosing or excluding bacterial infections in different body fluids. The synovial LE test can be used as an accurate test to rapidly rule in or out an acute articular bacterial infection, even in patients with concurrent inflammatory arthritis.",

Objectives The primary objective was to develop and validate a Brazilian Portuguese version of the PsAQoL. Methods The UK PsAQoL was translated into Brazilian Portuguese using two translation panels. This translation then checked for face validity and construct validity with new samples of patients. Finally, a test-retest validation study was conducted with 52 patients with PsA. The survey included the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) as a comparator instrument. Results Internal consistency and reproducibility were both excellent for the new adaptation (0.91 and 0.90 respectively Scores on the PsAQoL were found to correlate as expected with the comparator measure and the instrument was able to detect differences in score related to perceived severity of PsA, general health status and presence of a flare. Conclusion The Brazilian PsAQoL was found easy to understand and complete and has excellent reliability and construct validity. The new measure will be a valuable new tool for use in routine PsA practice and clinical trials.",

Among them, 97% were women with an average of 37.9 years (SD: 11.3) and 46.5% had more than 7 years of disease duration. Two or more risk factors for pneumonia were found in 64.9%. Coverage for influenza and pneumococcal was 42.7 and 25% respectively, being lower than in Europe. Tetanus coverage was the most important predictor for receiving influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Lack of prescription was the most common cause of non-application (64.6%). Conclusions Vaccination coverage for influenza and pneumonia is low in Latin America, especially compared to Europe.

Since then, our state has implemented referral protocols and a triage system with teleconsulting support exclusively for referrals from locations outside the capital, permitting a comparison between patients screened and not screened by the new system. Methods Physicians of the Rheumatology Service at Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceição prospectively collected information regarding first visits over a 6-month period (Oct 2017 to March 2018). We recorded demographic characteristics, diagnostic hypotheses, date of referral, and the municipality of origin (within the state of Rio Grande do Sul). We considered adequate referrals from primary health care when a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease (SIRD) was suspected at first evaluation by the attending rheumatologist. Results Three hundred fifty-seven patients/appointments were eligible for analysis (193 from the capital and 164 from small and medium towns). In 2007/2008, suspected SIRD occurred in 76/260 (29.2%) and 73/222 (32.9%) among patients from the capital and outside counties, respectively ( P = 0.387). In 2017/2018, suspected SIRD occurred in 75/193 (38.9%) and 111/164 (67.7%) in patients from the capital and outside counties, respectively (difference: 28.8, 95% CI: 19.0 to 38.9, P &lt; 0.001), indicating a marked improvement in referrals submitted to the new triage system. Conclusion The quality of Rheumatology referrals in our state improved over the 10-year interval under study, particularly among patients from locations submitted to referral protocols and teleconsulting support.",

Objective This study aimed to assess whether patients maintain their treatment for rheumatic conditions during the pandemic period and determine the factors responsible for discontinuation. Methods Patients were randomly selected from the prospectively collected database of our tertiary referral center. The patients were interviewed by telephone through a standardized closed-ended questionnaire, which is targeting the continuity of the treatment plan and the considerations related to the individual choice. The patients were asked whether they hesitated to visit the hospital for follow-up or intravenous drug administration. Results A total of 278 patients completed the questionnaire. While 62 of the patients (22.3%) had reduced or interrupted the treatment, only 11 patients (3.9%) stopped the treatment completely. A significant difference was observed between the duration of illness and the discontinuation of treatment. (p = 0.023) There was a significant difference in disease activity between the group that stopped treatment and continued treatment. (p = 0.001) There was no statistically significant difference in other demographic characteristics. One hundred thirty-five patients (48.6%) made the treatment decision by themselves, and 80% continued the treatment. Reasons for stopping the treatment were anxiety (48.4%), not being able to go to the hospital for intravenous treatment (45.1%), and not being able to find the drug (6.5%). Conclusion Since patients with long-term illnesses were found to be significantly more likely to stop their treatment, this group of patients should be monitored.",

The number of medical specialties that use HEp-2-IIFA in the investigation of autoimmune diseases has increased lately. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and patterns of autoantibodies on HEp-2-IIFA according to demographics variables and referring medical specialties.A retrospective analysis of the HEp-2-IIFA carried out between January and June of 2017 was performed. The International Consensus on Antinuclear Antibodies Patterns (ICAP) and the Brazilian Consensus on Autoantibodies were used for patterns definition on visual reading of the slides. Anti-cell (AC) codes from ICAP and Brazilian AC codes (BAC) were used for patterns classification.From 54,990 samples referred for HEp-2-IIF testing, 20.9% were positive at titer ≥ 1/80. HEp-2-IIFA positivity in females and males was 24% and 12%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The proportion of positive results in the 4 age groups analyzed: 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, and ≥ 60 years was 23.3, 20.2, 20.1, and 22.8%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Considering all positive sera (n = 11,478), AC-4 nuclear fine speckled (37.7%), AC-2 nuclear dense fine speckled (21.3%), BAC-3 nuclear quasi-homogeneous (10%) and mixed/composite patterns (8.8%) were the most prevalent patterns. The specialties that most requested HEp-2-IIFA were general practitioner (20.1%), dermatology (15%), gynecology (9.9%), rheumatology (8.5%), and cardiology (5.8%). HEp-2-IIFA positivity was higher in patients referred by rheumatologists (35.7% vs. 19.6%) (p < 0.0001). Moderate (46.4%) and high (10.8%) titers were more observed in patients referred by rheumatologists (p < 0.0001). We observed a high proportion of mixed and cytoplasmic patterns in samples referred by oncologists and a high proportion of BAC-3 (nuclear quasi-homogeneous) pattern in samples referred by pneumologists.One-fifth of the patients studied were HEp-2-IIFA-positive. The age groups with more positive results were 0-19 and ≥ 60 years. AC-4, AC-2, BAC-3 and mixed/composite patterns were the most frequent patterns observed. Rheumatologists requested only 8.5% of HEp-2-IIFA. Positive results and moderate to high titers of autoantibodies were more frequent in patients referred by rheumatologists.",

Genetic association estimates for RA (6236 cases and 147,221 controls) and SLE (538 cases and 213,145 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen study through the IEU GWAS database. Results MR analyses using the inverse-variance weighted method showed that tea intake was not associated with risk of RA [odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increment in genetically predicted tea intake = 0.997, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.658–1.511] and SLE (OR per standard deviation increment in genetically predicted tea intake = 0.961, 95% CI 0.299–3.092). Weighted median, weighted mode, MR-Egger, leave-one-out and multivariable MR controlling for several confounding factors including current tobacco smoking, coffee intake, and alcoholic drinks per week yielded completely consistent results.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Takayasu’s arteritis (TA) is a vasculitis that affects the aorta and its branches and causes stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysms. Up to 60% of TA patients are associated with cardiac involvement which confers a poor prognosis. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) analysis is an echocardiographic technique that can detect the presence of subclinical systolic dysfunction. Hence, this study aimed to describe the prevalence of subclinical systolic dysfunction in patients with TA using the GLS method and to correlate this finding with disease activity using the ITAS-2010 (Indian Takayasu Activity Score). Methods Thirty patients over 18 years of age who met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 criteria for TA were included. The sample was submitted for medical record review, clinical and echocardiographic evaluation, and application of ITAS-2010. The cutoff for systolic dysfunction was GLS &gt; – 20%. Results Of the 30 patients analyzed, 25 (83.3%) were female, and the mean age was 42.6 years (± 13.2). The median time since diagnosis was 7.5 years [range, 3–16.6 years], and the type V angiographic classification was the most prevalent (56.7%). Regarding echocardiographic findings, the median ejection fraction (EF) was 66% [61–71%] and the GLS was − 19.5% [-21.3 to -15.8%]. Although half of the participants had reduced GLS, only two had reduced EF. Eleven patients (33.%) met the criteria for activity. An association was found between disease activity and reduced GLS in eight patients (P = 0.02) using the chi-square test. Conclusion GLS seems to be an instrument capable of the early detection of systolic dysfunction in TA. The association between GLS and disease activity in this study should be confirmed in a study with a larger sample size.",

The purpose of the present study was to draw a clinical and demographic profile of GPA patients living in Northeastern Brazil based on laboratory, histological and imaging findings, and evaluate the frequency of organic involvement. Clinical, epidemiological and treatment data of GPA patients were collected retrospectively and compared with the literature. The cohort included 25 GPA patients (84% female) aged 45.8 ± 16.1 years. Renal and ear-nose-throat (ENT) manifestations were the most common (both 64%). One third (32%) of the patients had 24-h proteinuria > 1 g, 50% had creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min at the time of diagnosis, and 33% had recurrent kidney damage during disease progress. The affected organs included lungs (60%), joints (44%), skin (32%), peripheral nervous system (28%), eyes (28%) and heart (16%). ENT involvement (n = 16/64%) was less frequent in our region than in São Paulo (n = 115/85.8%). Renal (n = 16/64%) and pulmonary (n = 15/60%) involvement was less frequent in our region than in the U.K. (renal n = 30/90%; pulmonary n = 28/84.8%). Most of our patients were female, presented the generalized form and were diagnosed late. The frequency of the main clinical manifestations (ENT, renal and pulmonary) was lower than that observed at higher latitudes, suggesting the existence of a Northeast Brazilian clinical and epidemiological profile and adding to our knowledge of this rare condition.",

This work aimed to evaluate the impact of PsA in Brazilian and French subjects, as well as to explore cultural differences in the experience of disease and to recognize domains important for patients living with PsA outside Europe. A qualitative study was conducted in two university hospitals in Brazil and France; outpatients fulfilling Classification Criteria for PsA participated in individual interviews regarding the impact of PsA; interviews were conducted in the local language. The sample size was defined by saturation; interviews were recorded and transcribed and content analysis was performed. Fifteen patients were interviewed in Brazil and 13 in France. Mean disease duration was 16.5 ± 12.5 years (range: 8 months to 47 years) and 14.4 ± 8.4 years (range 12 months to 29 years) for Brazilian and French subjects, respectively. A broad impact was perceived: 67 codes emerged from the interviews and were grouped in 41 categories. Although 2/3 of categories were common to both nationalities, some important health domains from the perspective of PsA patients from a non-European background were brought to light including sexual dysfunction, emotional impact of psoriasis and impact of prejudice on social and professional life. This study highlights the importance of assessing the impact of PsA on a national level, emphasizing the common cross-cultural aspects but also revealing domains of interest for patients with PsA living outside Europe which merit further study.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the main joint and extra-articular manifestations related to spondyloarthritis (SpA) after bariatric surgery (BS) in a retrospective cohort.Demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging data from nine patients whose SpA symptoms started after a BS have been described. Modified New York (mNY) criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axial (ax-SpA) and peripheral (p-SpA) spondyloarthritis were applied.The mean weight reduction after BS was 49.3 ± 21.9 kg. The BS techniques were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 8; 88.9%) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (n = 1; 11.1%). Four (44.4%) patients had no axial or peripheral pain complaints before BS, while the other four (44.4%) had sporadic non-inflammatory back pain that had been attributed to obesity. One patient (11.1%) had persistent chronic back pain. In all nine cases, patients reported back pain onset or pattern (intensity or night pain) change after BS (mean time 14.7 ± 18 months). In addition, 8 of them (88.9%) were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positive. All nine patients could be classified according to ASAS criteria as ax-SpA and five (55.6%) patients were classified as AS, according to the mNY criteria.Our data highlight a temporal link between SpA onset symptoms and the BS, suggesting a possible causal plausibility between the two events.",

It is associated with an altered level of Tregs and oxidative stress while an increase in Tregs, and different antioxidant mechanisms to combat oxidative stress are essential for successful pregnancy. Hence, this study aims to determine the level of CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs and oxidative stress in pregnant lupus patients.Ten healthy and 10 pregnant lupus volunteers from the North Indian population, within the age group of 20-30 years were enrolled in the study. All the patients were non-smokers, non-alcoholics and were not associated or undergoing therapy for any other disease. They had a SLEDAI of 37.4 ± 7.32 with 5.2 ± 1.93 years of disease duration. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the enzyme activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and the level of reduced glutathione and lipids peroxidised, spectrophotometrically. Flowcytometry was performed for immunophenotyping to determine CD8+ and CD4+ Tregs.Elevated CD8+ Tregs and diminished CD4+ Tregs were observed in pregnant lupus patients. Oxidative stress was significantly increased as the activities of anti-oxidant enzymes and level of reduced glutathione was considerably diminished. There was a substantial increase in the amount of lipids peroxidised.Pregnant lupus patients undergo considerable level of oxidative stress in comparison to healthy pregnant woman. The decreased level of CD4+ Tregs and an increase in CD8+ Tregs might be another important factor responsible for pregnancy associated complications. Hence, lupus leads to alterations in the necessary conditions for a successful pregnancy, which might eventually cause higher mortality, morbidity and associated complications.",

The distribution of cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors was similar between the patients and the control group (P > 0.05) at the time of the analysis. The patients with DM and the control group had similar aerobic capacity. However, the patients with ASS exhibited significantly reduced aerobic capacity (relative VO2 peak, anaerobic threshold, respiratory compensation point and time to exhaustion) when compared to the control group. In addition, patients with ASS had a lower anaerobic threshold compared to the DM group. There were no significant relationships between the aerobic capacity and disease status, cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors.In contrast to DM patients and healthy individuals, patients with stable ASS have significantly impaired aerobic capacity, which is unlikely to be totally explained by traditional cardiovascular diseases, their risk factors and disease status. Further studies are needed to corroborate our data and to clarify the cause of this reduced aerobic capacity in ASS.",

This study aims to compare the performance of trunk muscles in women with FM and healthy controls and evaluate the correlation between trunk muscle strength and FM severity. Methods Forty-six patients with FM and 42 age- and body mass index-matched healthy housewives without FM were included in the FM and control groups, respectively. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used for the assessment of FM severity. The pain intensity was evaluated using the visual analogical scale (VAS). An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the isokinetic trunk muscle strength. The peak torque (PT) values were recorded. The psychological status of the patients was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory. Results There was no statistically significant difference in terms of age, BMI, and BDI scores in two groups ( p &gt; 0.05, for all). The isokinetic trunk extensor PT values were significantly lower in the FM group ( p = 0.002 for 60°/s, and p &lt; 0.001 for 90°/s and 120°/s) than control group. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between FIQ score and isokinetic extensor muscle parameters. Conclusion The results indicate that trunk extensor muscles were significantly weaker in FM patients. Trunk extensor muscle strength decreased as FM severity increased in FM patients.",

The emergence of functional neuroimaging allowed new insights into brain structure and physiology in normality and chronic pain. While occupational related aspects are recognized as important risk factors for chronicity there have not been thus far evaluated by fMRI experiments. The overall objective of this study is to compare the neuronal correlates between groups of individuals CLBP with or without sick-leave demands.A total of 74 individuals were divided into three groups: chronic low back pain with sick-leave demands [CLBP_L]; chronic low back pain without sick-leave demands [CLBP_NL]; individuals without pain or sick-leave demands [Control]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess brain function during moderate acute pain stimulation task (thumb controlled pressure).After acute painful stimulation, a higher brain response was found in the anterior cingulate and superior and medium frontal gyrus was observed in CLBP_NL vs. CLBP_L (p < 0,001) and increased brain response in the frontal pole and paracingulate region in control vs. CLBP_L (p < 0.001) during acute pain stimulation.The modulation of acute pain participates in the mechanism propagating chronic pain perception. The lower activation in the superior frontal gyrus observed in the CLBP_L group compared to CLBP_NL, reinforces the idea of an already existing activation in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Sjögren’s Syndrome compromises the exocrine function, producing xerostomia and xerophthalmia. It can appear as an isolated condition or associated with other autoimmune diseases (polyautoimmunity). The Unstimulated Salivary Flow rate (UWSF) is used to quantify saliva production. There is no objective evidence to differentiate the values in patients with Sjögren’s versus healthy people or patients with non-Sjögren’s sicca. The objective of the present review was to evaluate the UWSF in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome in comparison to controls (healthy and non-Sjögren’s sicca patients). Methods A systematic literature review was carried out (PRISMA guidelines). Analytical observational studies of cases and controls, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies and randomized clinical trials (including healthy controls) were considered. The Medline/OVID, Lilacs, Embase, and Cochrane/OVID databases were consulted. MeSH, DeCS, keywords, and Boolean operators were used. The meta-analysis (RevMan 5.2) was done through the random-effects model [mean difference (MD)]. Level and quality of evidence were evaluated by the Oxford Center Levels of Evidence and Joanna Brigs list respectively. Results Thirty-two articles were included (20 were case-control studies, 6 were cross-sectional, 2 prospective cohort, 2 retrospective cohort, and 2 studies were abstracts) and 28 were meta-analyzed. The unstimulated whole salivary flow rate in the Sjögren’s group was lower than in controls (healthy and patients with non-Sjögren Sicca syndrome) (MD-0.18 ml/min; 95% CI, − 0.24 to − 0.13; chi 2 - P -value &lt; 0.00001). Heterogeneity was 97% and there was publication bias (funnel plot). The level of evidence was mostly 3 or 4. The quality of evidence was met (97% of items valued). Conclusion For the first time, the unstimulated whole salivary flow rate is found to be lower in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome compared to controls (healthy and non-SS sicca) through a meta-analysis.

For this analysis, we sought the prices and registries of drugs marketed between 1999 and October 1, 2019, in the regulatory agencies' databases. The pricing between countries was based on purchasing power parity (PPP).The US authorized the commercialization of 13 distinct biologicals and four biosimilars in the period. Spain and Brazil marketed 14 biopharmaceuticals for RA, ten original, four biosimilars. Colombia and Mexico have authorized three biosimilars in addition to the ten biological ones. For biological drug prices, the US is the most expensive country. Spain's price behavior seems intermediate when compared to the three LA countries. Brazil has the highest LA prices, followed by Mexico and Colombia, which has the lowest prices. Spain has the lowest values in PPP, compared to LA countries, while the US has the highest prices.The economic effort that LA countries make to access these medicines is much higher than the US and Spain. The use of the PPP ensured a better understanding of the actual access to these inputs in the countries analyzed.",

Methods Sixty-three patients with lumbar canal stenosis were randomized into two groups: the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). IG patients underwent surgery and both groups participated in the same physical therapy program twice a week for a period of 12 weeks and were followed up at 1 year. The primary endpoint was visual analogue scale for pain, and the secondary endpoints were function (6-min walk test, Roland Morris and Oswestry questionnaires), quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) and satisfaction with treatment (Likert scale). Results No significant difference between groups was observed for pain over time ( p = 0.145). Significant differences between groups, in favor of the IG, were observed for the Oswestry score ( p = 0.006) and vitality domain score of the SF-36 ( p = 0.047). Function in the Roland Morris and 6-min walk test and the role of the physical domain of SF-36 also showed significant differences between the groups; however, these differences occurred due to a worsening of the IG in the short term, and the medium-term. The Likert scale demonstrated greater satisfaction with the IG treatment compared to control group. Conclusions Lumbar stenosis surgery did not improve pain in short and medium terms. Function and vitality were better in the group that underwent surgery in the medium term, and patients were more satisfied with the surgical treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In autoimmune inflammatory rheumatological diseases, routine cardiovascular risk assessment is becoming more important. As an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is recognized in patients with fibromyalgia (FM), a combination of traditional CVD risk assessment tool with Machine Learning (ML) predictive model could help to identify non-traditional CVD risk factors. Methods This study was a retrospective case–control study conducted at a quaternary care center in India. Female patients diagnosed with FM as per 2016 modified American College of Rheumatology 2010/2011 diagnostic criteria were enrolled; healthy age and gender-matched controls were obtained from Non-communicable disease Initiatives and Research at AMrita (NIRAM) study database. Firstly, FM cases and healthy controls were age-stratified into three categories of 18–39 years, 40–59 years, and ≥ 60 years. A 10 year and lifetime CVD risk was calculated in both cases and controls using the ASCVD calculator. Pearson chi-square test and Fisher's exact were used to compare the ASCVD risk scores of FM patients and controls across the age categories. Secondly, ML predictive models of CVD risk in FM patients were developed. A random forest algorithm was used to develop the predictive models with ASCVD 10 years and lifetime risk as target measures. Model predictive accuracy of the ML models was assessed by accuracy, f1-score, and Area Under 'receiver operating Curve' (AUC). From the final predictive models, we assessed risk factors that had the highest weightage for CVD risk in FM. Results A total of 139 FM cases and 1820 controls were enrolled in the study. FM patients in the age group 40–59 years had increased lifetime CVD risk compared to the control group (OR = 1.56, p = 0.043). However, CVD risk was not associated with FM disease severity and disease duration as per the conventional statistical analysis. ML model for 10-year ASCVD risk had an accuracy of 95% with an f1-score of 0.67 and AUC of 0.825. ML model for the lifetime ASCVD risk had an accuracy of 72% with an f1-score of 0.79 and AUC of 0.713. In addition to the traditional risk factors for CVD, FM disease severity parameters were important contributors in the ML predictive models. Conclusion FM patients of the 40–59 years age group had increased lifetime CVD risk in our study. Although FM disease severity was not associated with high CVD risk as per the conventional statistical analysis of the data, it was among the highest contributor to ML predictive model for CVD risk in FM patients. This also highlights that ML can potentially help to bridge the gap of non-linear risk factor identification.",

A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with MSU crystal positivity on DECT. Results A total of 148 patients with clinical diagnosis of gout were included, and MSU crystal deposition on DECT was observed in 64 patients (43.3%). The patients with positive DECT results were more likely to have renal insufficiency, longer disease duration, and higher serum urate level than those with negative. In the multivariable analysis, first gout attack (odds ratio 0.462; 95% confidence interval 0.229–0.931, p = 0.031) was associated with a less likely MSU crystal deposit-positive DECT result.

Aim To compare the performance of tuberculin skin test (TST), TST-Booster, ELISPOT (T-SPOT.TB) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube (QFT-IT) to detect LTBI in patients with CIA on TNFi. Patients and methods A total of 102 patients with CIA [rheumatoid arthritis (RA), n = 40; ankylosing spondylitis (AS), n = 35; psoriatic arthritis (PsA), n = 7; and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), n = 20] were prospectively followed-up for 24 months to identify incident LTBI cases. Epidemiologic data, TST, T-SPOT.TB, QFT-IT and a chest X-ray were performed at baseline and after 6 months of LTBI treatment. Results Thirty six percent (37/102) of patients had positive TST or Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) tests. Agreement among TST and IGRAs was moderate (k = 0.475; p = 0.001), but high between T-SPOT.TB and QFT-IT (k = 0.785; p &lt; 0.001). During the 24-Month follow-up, 15 (18.5%) incident cases of LTBI were identified. In comparison to TST, the IGRAs increased the LTBI diagnosis power in 8.5% (95% CI 3.16–17.49). TST-Booster did not add any value in patients with negative TST at baseline. After 6-Month isoniazid therapy, IGRAs results did not change significantly. Conclusions Almost 20% of CIA patients had some evidence of LTBI, suggesting higher conversion rate after exposition to TNFi. TST was effective in identifying new cases of LTBI, but IGRAs added diagnostic power in this scenario. Our findings did not support the repetition of IGRAs after 6-Month isoniazid therapy and this approach was effective to mitigate active TB in 2 years of follow-up.",

Disease parameters, laboratorial tests and treatment were also evaluated in JDM patients. The mean current age was similar in patients and controls (11.5 ± 3.75 vs. 11.2 ± 2.58 years,p = 0.703). Regarding lipid profile, the median triglycerides [80(31–340) vs. 61(19–182)mg/dL,p = 0.011] and VLDL[16(6–68) vs. 13(4–36)mg/dL,p = 0.020] were significantly higher in JDM patients versus controls.

The current study was proposed to investigate the presence of anti-C1q and anti-nucleosome antibodies in the sera of Egyptian patients with SLE and their association with LN. Eighty patients with SLE were included. Patients were classified into, a LN group including 40 cases with active LN (based on the results of renal biopsy and renal SLEDAI≥4) and a non renal SLE group including 40 patients (with no clinical or laboratory evidence of renal involvement that were attributed in the past or present to SLE).

Anti-C1q antibody showed a statistically significant association with the presence of vasculitis and nephritis while anti-nucleosome antibody didn’t show a significant association with the presence of any clinical features. Double positivity of anti-nucleosome and anti-C1q antibodies showed a statistically significant association with the presence of vasculitis and photosensitivity, high ECLAM score, elevated ESR, low serum albumin and low C3 levels. Serum anti-C1q antibody has a significant association with LN while double positive antibodies have a significant association with vasculitis and low C3 levels in Egyptian patients with SLE.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Osteoporosis is a major healthcare concern in Latin America. Factors such as changing demographics, fragmented healthcare systems, and financial considerations may result in a huge increase in the burden of osteoporosis in this region. The aim of this article is to describe the baseline clinical characteristics and fracture history of patients who are prescribed teriparatide in normal clinical practice in Latin America. Methods We conducted a prospective, multinational, observational study (the Asia and Latin America Fracture Observational Study [ALAFOS]) in 20 countries worldwide to assess the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis receiving teriparatide as a part of routine clinical practice in a real-world setting. In this subregional analysis of the ALAFOS study, we report the clinical characteristics, fracture history, risk factors for osteoporosis, comorbidities, previous osteoporosis therapies and health-related quality of life measures at baseline for patients from the four participant Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Results The Latin America subregional cohort included 546 postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age: 71.0 [10.1] years; range: 40–94 years), constituting 18% of the ALAFOS total population. The baseline mean (SD) bone mineral density T-scores were − 3.02 (1.23) at the lumbar spine and − 2.31 (0.96) at the femoral neck; 62.8% of patients had a history of low trauma fracture after the age of 40 years and 39.7% of patients had experienced ≥1 fall in the past year. Osteoporosis medications were used by 70.9% of patients before initiating teriparatide. The median (Q1, Q3) EQ-5D-5 L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for perceived health status at baseline was 70 (50, 80). The mean (SD) worst back pain numeric rating scale score for the overall Latin American cohort was 4.3 (3.4) at baseline. Conclusions This baseline analysis of the Latin America subregion of the ALAFOS study indicates that patients who are prescribed teriparatide in the four participant countries had severe osteoporosis and high prevalence of fractures. They also had back pain and poor health-related quality of life. The proportions of patients with severe or extreme problems on the EQ-5D-5 L individual domains were lower than those in the overall ALAFOS study population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Injection of Hylan G-F20 (HY) into joints may provoke local flares, which mechanisms may involve reaction to protein contaminants. We have previously developed a protein-free saline-soluble galactomannan derived from guar gum (GM) that displays both analgesia and chondroprotection in experimental osteoarthritis (OA). We now demonstrate that both GM and Hylan G-F20 (HY) promote mild synovitis with cytokine release after intra-articular injection. Methods Mice received 100 μg/25 μL GM or HY or saline into the knees. Joint pain was evaluated using von Frey test; cell influx, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and CXCL-1 (pg/mL) levels were assessed in joint lavage at 6 h. Synovia were excised for histopathology. Results Neither GM nor HY after being given into mice knee joints induced pain albeit promoting mild cell influx into joint washings as well as mild synovitis at histology, with no damage to the underlying cartilage. HY but not GM promoted IL-1 release into mice joints. Both compounds induced IL-6 and CXCL-1 release. Conclusion Intra-articular injection of HY or GM promote acute transient synovitis whilst not provoking detectable significant joint damage. Local administration of these polysaccharides induces acute intra-articular release of inflammatory cytokines, which may account for joint flares following viscosupplementation.",

Methods The Brazilian version of FSQ was produced following the recommendations for cross-cultural adaptation. Validity of Brazilian FSQ self-administration was assessed by checking agreement of its results with fibromyalgia diagnosis according the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Reproducibility and validity of FSQ by telephone were assessed by comparing its results with the previous FSQ self-administration. Results A Brazilian Portuguese version (FSQ-Brazil) was produced. FSQ-Brazil had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha between 0.73 and 0.94). Agreement between the results obtained by self-administration of FSQ-Brazil and by telephone interview was substantial or almost perfect for almost all questions about pain sites and all questions about other somatic symptoms (Cohen’s kappa higher than 0.6). There were small but significant bias toward higher scores of widespread pain index and fibromyalgia severity scale in the telephone interview compared to self-administration. Fibromyalgia definition by self-administration and telephone interview with FSQ-Brazil both revealed substantial agreement with the diagnosis based on ACR 1990 criteria (Cohen’s kappa 0.62 and 0.65; respectively). Conclusions FSQ-Brazil demonstrated good internal consistency, reproducibility and validity both by self-administration and by telephone interview. However, caution must be taken with the interpretation of quantitative scores of widespread pain index and symptoms severity scale, which slightly differed according the method (self-administration or interview) in our study.",

However, there is a lack of information regarding COVID-19 in these patients, especially in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with RA. Methods This multicenter, prospective cohort study is within the ReumaCoV Brazil registry and included 489 patients with RA. In this context, 269 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were compared to 220 patients who tested negative for COVID-19 (control group). All patient data were collected from the Research Electronic Data Capture database. Results The participants were predominantly female (90.6%) with a mean age of 53 ± 12 years. Of the patients with COVID-19, 54 (20.1%) required hospitalization. After multiple adjustments, the final regression model showed that heart disease (OR = 4.61, 95% CI 1.06–20.02.

Methods Targeting capabilities of anti-FnEDA mAbs were demonstrated by biodistribution study where i.v. injected antibodies were detected by conjugated near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore, 125 I label and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the injected antibody. Location of FnEDA expression in both mCIA and human RA tissue were mapped by IHC. Quantification of anti-FnEDA mAbs targeted to disease tissue was measured by whole-body autoradiography (WBA). Timing of the targeting was interrogated with fluorescent and confocal microscopy using anti-FnEDA mAbs labeled with different fluorophores and injected at different times. Results Anti-FnEDA mAbs show specific targeting to diseased paws of mCIA animal. The targeting was focused on inflamed synovium which is consistent with FnEDA expression profile in both mCIA and human RA tissues. Anti-FnEDA mAbs accumulated in diseased tissue at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, the targeting was sustained for up to 14 days and FnEDA was able to support targeting of multiple doses of anti-FnEDA mAbs given 5 days apart. Conclusion FnEDA is specifically upregulated in the inflamed tissues of mCIA. Antibodies specific for FnEDA can be useful as molecular delivery vehicles for disease specific targeting of payloads to inflamed joint tissue.",

Methods ReumaCoV Brazil is a multicenter prospective cohort of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases (IMRD) patients with COVID-19 (case group), compared to a control group of IMRD patients without COVID-19. SpA patients enrolled were grouped as axial SpA (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and enteropathic arthritis, according to usual classification criteria. Results 353 SpA patients were included, of whom 229 (64.9%) were axSpA, 118 (33.4%) PsA and 6 enteropathic arthritis (1.7%). No significant difference was observed in disease activity before the study inclusion comparing cases and controls, as well no worsening of disease activity after COVID-19. The risk factors associated with hospitalization were age over 60 years (OR = 3.71; 95% CI 1.62–8.47, p = 0.001); one or more comorbidities (OR = 2.28; 95% CI 1.02–5.08, p = 0.001) and leflunomide treatment (OR = 4.46; 95% CI 1.33–24.9, p = 0.008). Not having comorbidities (OR = 0.11; 95% CI 0.02–0.50, p = 0.001) played a protective role for hospitalization. In multivariate analysis, leflunomide treatment (OR = 8.69; CI = 95% 1.41–53.64; p = 0.023) was associated with hospitalization; teleconsultation (OR = 0.14; CI = 95% 0.03–0.71; p = 0.01) and no comorbidities (OR = 0.14; CI = 95% 0.02–0.76; p = 0.02) remained at final model as protective factor. Conclusions Our results showed no association between pre-COVID disease activity or that SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger disease activity in patients with SpA. Teleconsultation and no comorbidities were associated with a lower hospitalization risk. Leflunomide remained significantly associated with higher risk of hospitalization after multiple adjustments.",

Better patient-reported functional outcomes are found when lower disease activity is achieved. Objectives To evaluate the variation of physical function by HAQ-DI over time in PsA patients treated with standard therapy in a real-life setting: to verify predictors of achieving a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in function by HAQ-DI (ΔHAQ-DI ≤ − 0.35) and to measure the impact of achieving REM/LDA on long-term function by HAQ-DI. Methods This is a longitudinal analysis of a real-life retrospective cohort. Data from PsA patients with at least 4 years of follow-up in the PsA clinic from 2011 to 2019 were extracted from electronic medical records. The variations of physical function by HAQ-DI and disease activity by DAPSA over time were calculated. A multivariate hierarchical regression model was applied to verify predictors of MCID in HAQ-DI. A comparison of HAQ-DI variation between patients with DAPSA REM, LDA, moderate and high disease activity was made using the generalized estimating equation model (GEE), adjusted by Bonferroni test. The Spearman correlation method was applied to verify the correlation of ΔDAPSA and ΔHAQ-DI over time. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS program version 21.0. Results Seventy-three patients were included in the analysis. Physical function measured by HAQ-DI was determined by PsA disease activity measured by DAPSA ( p &lt; 0.000). A moderate and statistically significant correlation between ΔDAPSA and ΔHAQ-DI was observed (r s = 0.60; p &lt; 0.001). Only patients in DAPSA REM demonstrated a constant decline in HAQ-DI scores during the follow-up. White ethnicity and older age at baseline were predictors for not achieving MCID in HAQ-DI [RR 0.33 (0.16–0.6795% CI p = 0.002) and RR 0.96 (0.93–0.9895% CI p &lt; 0.000), respectively, while higher scores of HAQ-DI at baseline were predictors of achieving MCID [RR 1.71 (1.12–2.6095%CI p = 0.013)]. Conclusions In PsA, patients who maintained DAPSA REM/LDA over time had better long-term functional outcomes. Higher HAQ-DI scores at baseline, non-white ethnicity and younger age were predictors for achieving a clinical meaningful improvement of HAQ-DI.",

Although core decompression is an approved and trusted technique to prevent further joint deterioration, this surgical method seems to be less beneficial for SLE patients. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of core decompression in SLE patients with primary stages of femoral head osteonecrosis. Methods In this study, 23 patients (39 affected hip joints) with osteonecrosis of the femoral head with stage II of the disease, based on the Ficat-Arlet classification system, underwent core decompression. Also, patients demographic characteristics, clinical data, medication history, comorbidities, immunological findings, hip plain radiographs, history of total hip arthroplasty after core decompression, and patients satisfaction with joint function according to the Oxford hip score questionnaire were obtained. Results In the study, 53.8% of affected joints showed signs of radiographic deterioration in follow-up imaging. Sixty-one and a half percent (61.5%) of patients had unsatisfactory joint performance. A third (33.3%) of affected hip joints underwent total hip arthroplasty up to 5 years from core decompression. SLE patients with a history of receiving bisphosphonate were 83.2% less dissatisfied with their joint function than patients without a history of bisphosphonate use ( P &lt; 0.02). Of the 23 studied cases, the mean cumulative dose of prednisolone before and after core decompression surgery was 46.41 mg and 14.74 mg respectively. Besides, one case (2.6%) that had a high anti-phospholipid antibodies level during follow-up did not have any radiographic deterioration, and 9 cases (23.1%) had some degrees of radiographic deterioration. Conclusions The patients group that used bis-phosphonate, had a higher level of satisfaction with joint function after core decompression. Patients with high-level anti-phospholipid antibodies are related to a poor prognosis after core decompression.",

In order to enable patients to receive timely attention and treatment, this study developed new diagnostic markers by exploring the expression and molecular mechanism of the long non-coding RNA NORAD (NORAD) in RA. Methods Participants including 77 RA patients and 52 healthy persons were enrolled, and the corresponding clinical data and serum samples were obtained. The NORAD and miR-204-5p expression were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The content of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) were determined through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Luciferase activity reporter assay demonstrated the association between NORAD and miR-204-5p. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of NORAD, and Pearson’s correlation analysis was applied for the correlation analysis. Results NORAD was enriched in RA serum with high diagnostic value. Simultaneously, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were also upregulated ( P &lt; 0.001). The C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (Anti-CCP) levels in RA patients were generally elevated ( P &lt; 0.001). NORAD was positively correlated with the levels of clinical indicators and inflammatory factors ( P &lt; 0.0001). Mechanistically, NORAD may affect the progression of RA by targeting and negatively regulating miR-204-5p. Conclusions There is a correlation between NORAD and the processes of RA, and NORAD has the potential to predict and diagnose the occurrence of RA.",

Methods This retrospective cohort study included 32 patients with difficult-to-treat RA who failed to a JAKi and subsequently to one or more bDMARDs and then switched to a second JAKi. To assess drug survival, electronic medical records of each patient were reviewed. Data on whether the second JAKi was discontinued, and the reasons for discontinuation were collected. The change of disease activity was assessed by analyzing changes in tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient’s global assessment of disease activity on a visual-analogue scale (VAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Disease Activity Score for 28 joints with ESR (DAS28-ESR), and DAS28-CRP from baseline to that at six months from initiation of the second JAKi. Results Overall, discontinuation of the second JAKi occurred in 20 (62.5%) patients. Primary failure, secondary failure, adverse events, and insurance coverage issues were the reasons for discontinuation in 9 (45.0%), 5 (25.0%), 2 (10.0%), and 4 (20.0%) patients, respectively. The estimated 2-year drug survival rate was 39.3%. In terms of change of disease activity, the second JAKi significantly improved TJC ( p &lt; 0.001), SJC ( p &lt; 0.001), VAS ( p &lt; 0.001), CRP ( p = 0.026), DAS28-ESR ( p &lt; 0.001), and DAS28-CRP ( p &lt; 0.001) at 6-month compared with that at the baseline. Conclusions Second JAKi could be a therapeutic option in patients with difficult-to-treat RA who have failed to a JAKi and subsequent bDMARDs.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in IBD patients, according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria and the correlation of results of US of entheses and joints with plasma calprotectin levels. Methods This was an observational cross-sectional study. Patients from the IBD outpatient clinic of a reference center were evaluated according to ASAS criteria classification, results of US of entheses and joints, and inflammatory biomarker measurements (erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein levels, fecal and plasma calprotectin levels). A p value lower than 0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 30.5% of the studied sample (n = 118) of patients with IBD presented at least one inflammatory musculoskeletal manifestation. The overall prevalence of enteropathic SpA was 13.55%, with 10.16% axial SpA and 4.23% peripheral SpA according to the ASAS criteria. A total of 42.1% of patients had an MASEI score greater than 18, 35.2% had synovitis, and 14.7% had tenosynovitis on US, increasing the frequency of diagnosis of enteropathic SpA to 22.8%.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To illustrate how (standardised) effect sizes (ES) vary based on calculation method and to provide considerations for improved reporting. Methods Data from three trials of tanezumab in subjects with osteoarthritis were analyzed. ES of tanezumab versus comparator for WOMAC Pain (outcome) was defined as least squares difference between means (mixed model for repeated measures analysis) divided by a pooled standard deviation (SD) of outcome scores. Three approaches to computing the SD were evaluated: Baseline (the pooled SD of WOMAC Pain values at baseline [pooled across treatments]); Endpoint (the pooled SD of these values at the time primary endpoints were assessed); and Median (the median pooled SD of these values based on the pooled SDs across available timepoints). Bootstrap analyses were used to compute 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results ES (95% CI) of tanezumab 2.5 mg based on Baseline, Endpoint, and Median SDs in one study were − 0.416 (− 0.796, − 0.060), − 0.195 (− 0.371, − 0.028), and − 0.196 (− 0.373, − 0.028), respectively; negative values indicate pain improvement. This pattern of ES differences (largest with Baseline SD, smallest with Endpoint SD, Median SD similar to Endpoint SD) was consistent across all studies and doses of tanezumab. Conclusion Differences in ES affect interpretation of treatment effect. Therefore, we advocate clearly reporting individual elements of ES in addition to its overall calculation. This is particularly important when ES estimates are used to determine sample sizes for clinical trials, as larger ES will lead to smaller sample sizes and potentially underpowered studies.

Our study aims to evaluate the use of thermography in detecting subclinical joint inflammation at clinically quiescent (non-tender and non-swollen) metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The outcomes from thermography in our study will be compared with ultrasonography (which is a more established imaging tool used for joint inflammation assessment in RA). Methods The minimum (Tmin), average (Tavg) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures at the 10 MCPJs of each patient were summed to obtain the Total Tmin, Total Tavg and Total Tmax, respectively. Ultrasound grey-scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) joint inflammation (scored semi-quantitatively, 0–3) at the 10 MCPJs were summed up to derive the respective TGS and TPD scores per patient. Pearson’s correlation and simple linear regression were respectively used to assess correlation and characterize relationships between thermographic parameters (Total Tmin, Total Tavg and Total Tmax) and ultrasound imaging parameters (TGS, TPD and the number of joint(s) with PD ≥ 1 or GS ≥ 2). Results In this cross-sectional study, 420 clinically non-swollen and non-tender MCPJs from 42 RA patients were examined. All thermographic parameters (Total Tmin, Total Tavg and Total Tmax) correlated significantly ( P -values ranging from 0.001 to 0.0012) with TGS score (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.421 to 0.430), TPD score (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.383 to 0.424), and the number of joint(s) with PD ≥ 1 or GS ≥ 2 (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.447 to 0.465). Similarly, simple linear regression demonstrated a statistically significant relationship ( P -values ranging from 0.001 to 0.005) between all thermographic parameters (Total Tmin, Total Tavg and Total Tmax) and ultrasound imaging parameters (TPD and TGS). Conclusion For the first time, thermographic temperatures were shown to correlate with ultrasound-detected joint inflammation at clinically quiescent MCPJs. The use of thermography in the detection of subclinical joint inflammation in RA appears promising and warrants further investigation.",

Gout flare during active gastrointestinal bleeding poses a significant challenge due to the gastrointestinal side effects of anti-inflammatory therapy. This study sought to investigate the risk factors associated with gout flares during episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study involving 94 patients who experienced active gastrointestinal bleeding and had a history of gout. This study was conducted at Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital from January 2019 to October 2022. We collected and recorded demographic information and clinical characteristics. Results Among the gout flare patients, hyperuricemia and intravenous fat emulsion therapy were more prevalent compared to those who remained stable (81.6% vs. 57.8% and 46.9% vs. 24.4%, p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both hyperuricemia (odds ratio 2.741, 95% CI 1.014–7.413, p = 0.047) and intravenous fat emulsion therapy (odds ratio 2.645, 95% CI 1.046–6.686, p = 0.040) were independent predictors of gout flares. Furthermore, gout attacks occurred sooner in patients receiving intravenous fat emulsion therapy compared to those not receiving it (median: 4 days (interquartile range: 2) vs. median: 5 days (interquartile range: 2.25), p = 0.049). Conclusion Our study revealed a high incidence of gout flares during episodes of active gastrointestinal bleeding, with patients undergoing intravenous fat emulsion therapy and those with hyperuricemia being at increased risk.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sjögren’s disease (SD) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease that affects epithelial tissues, mainly salivary and lacrimal glands. It also presents extraglandular manifestations. The main renal manifestation is tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), which can manifest as renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Urinary citrate may be a biomarker of RTA in these patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether hypocitraturia is a predictive biomarker of RTA in a sample of patients with SD in a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil. Methods All patients with SD who met the inclusion criteria and who participated in the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Irmandade Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre were included. Demographic, SD, serological and urinary data were obtained. RTA was considered in those patients who persistently presented urinary pH above 5.5 and serum pH below 7.35. Patients who persistently had urinary pH above 5.5 underwent a urinary acidification test with furosemide and fludrocortisone. These patients received 1 mg of fludrocortisone and 40 mg of furosemide and had their urine samples tested 2, 4 and 6 h after taking the medications. The test was stopped at any urine sample with pH 5.5 or less. The variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation or interquartile range. The association between hypocitraturia and RTA was assessed using the chi-square. Results Forty-two patients were included, 95.2% female with a median age of 61.73 years. The prevalence of complete distal RTA was 4.88%. Twenty-eight patients underwent urine acidification testing. Five patients had hypocitraturia, and two of them had complete distal RTA. The association between hypocitraturia and RTA was statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.012), with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91.2% and accuracy of 91.7%. The negative predictive value was 100%. The global renal assessment of the population demonstrated two patients with RTA, one patient with decreased renal function and six patients with proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/24 h. Conclusion The prevalence of RTA in the studied population was 4.88%. Hypocitraturia had high sensitivity and accuracy for the diagnosis of RTA.",

Materials and methods We systematically searched articles on FM and ketamine published at Pubmed from 1966 to 2021. This study was registered at PROSPERO. Results There were only 6 articles published in this field, with a total of 115 patients. The female sex was predominant (88 to 100%). The age varied from 23 to 53 years old. Disease duration ranged from 1 month to 28 years. The dosage of ketamine changed from 0.1 mg/kg-0.3-0.5 mg/kg in intravenous infusion (4/5) and subcutaneous application (1/5). Regarding outcomes, the Visual analog scale (VAS) before ketamine was from 59 to 100 mm and after treatment from 2 to 95 mm. Most short-term studies had a good response. Only the study with 8 weeks of follow-up did not observe a good response. Side effects were common; all appeared during the infusion and disappeared after a few minutes of the ketamine injection. Conclusions The present study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of ketamine in FM patients in the short term.

    "abstract": "Abstract Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) arise from dysregulated innate immune system activity, which leads to systemic inflammation. These disorders, encompassing a diverse array of genetic defects classified as inborn errors of immunity, are significant diagnostic challenges due to their genetic heterogeneity and varied clinical presentations. Although recent advances in genetic sequencing have facilitated pathogenic gene discovery, approximately 40% of SAIDs patients lack molecular diagnoses. SAIDs have distinct clinical phenotypes, and targeted therapeutic approaches are needed. This review aims to underscore the complexity and clinical significance of SAIDs, focusing on prototypical disorders grouped according to their pathophysiology as follows: (i) inflammasomopathies, characterized by excessive activation of inflammasomes, which induces notable IL-1β release; (ii) relopathies, which are monogenic disorders characterized by dysregulation within the NF-κB signaling pathway; (iii) IL-18/IL-36 signaling pathway defect-induced SAIDs, autoinflammatory conditions defined by a dysregulated balance of IL-18/IL-36 cytokine signaling, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and tissue damage, mainly in the skin; (iv) type I interferonopathies, a diverse group of disorders characterized by uncontrolled production of type I interferons (IFNs), notably interferon α, β, and ε; (v) anti-inflammatory signaling pathway impairment-induced SAIDs, a spectrum of conditions characterized by IL-10 and TGFβ anti-inflammatory pathway disruption; and (vi) miscellaneous and polygenic SAIDs. The latter group includes VEXAS syndrome, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis/chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, Schnitzler syndrome, and Still’s disease, among others, illustrating the heterogeneity of SAIDs and the difficulty in creating a comprehensive classification. Therapeutic strategies involving targeted agents, such as JAK inhibitors, IL-1 blockers, and TNF inhibitors, are tailored to the specific disease phenotypes.",

This study explores the challenges faced by socioeconomically vulnerable PsA patients and the reasons for non-adherence to treatment guidelines. The main objective of the study is to develop a questionnaire to identify the primary challenges in PsA treatment adherence and to analyze its feasibility while simultaneously understanding the target population’s unique characteristics. Methods We included PsA patients meeting the Classification Criteria for PsA (CASPAR), excluding those with other overlapping inflammatory diseases. The study, supported by two patient-research partners, began with focus groups to identify treatment challenges, leading to the creation of a 26-item questionnaire. Its reliability was verified using the test-retest method, targeting a percent agreement ≥ 0.8. Then, PsA patients at a rheumatology clinic completed the final survey. Results The study involved 69 PsA patients. The final questionnaire contained 26-questions across five-domains, with a 92.2% agreement rate and an average completion time of 8.3 minutes. Diagnostic delays exceeded a year for 59% of patients and more than two years for 33%. Daily life disruptions affected 43.2% of patients, with 35.3% taking sick leave or retiring. Around 25% waited over 8 weeks for drug approval, and 17.6% required legal intervention to access medication. Drug dispensation issues impacted about 60% of patients. Furthermore, 66.7% lived far from their rheumatologist, with 49% traveling over an hour for appointments. Approximately 30% were unaware of the risks of methotrexatein relation to alcohol consumption and pregnancy. Conclusions The questionnaire was feasible and reliable, with its results underscoring patient-centric challenges in PsA management, particularly concerning diagnostic delays and medication access, as well as daily life disruptions and misinformation. These findings emphasize the urgency for healthcare reforms aimed at improving diagnosis efficiency, patient education, and streamlined medication access, emphasizing the need for tailored initiatives to improve the healthcare experience for PsA patients.",

Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest on elucidating mechanisms of rare autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases, allowing a better understanding of the role played by immune dysregulation on granulomatous, histiocytic, and hypereosinophilic disorders, just to name a few. This initiative enabled the rise of innovative targeted therapies for rheumatic RD. In this review, we explore the state-of-the art of rare RD and the critical role played by rheumatologists in healthcare.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (MCRFs), such as those related to aerobic capacity, muscle strength, physical activity, and body composition, have been poorly studied in Takayasu arteritis (TAK). Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate MCRFs and their relationships with disease status and comorbidities among patients with TAK. Methods A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted between 2019 and 2020, in which 20 adult women with TAK were compared with 16 healthy controls matched by gender, age, and body mass index. The following parameters were analyzed: aerobic capacity by cardiopulmonary test; muscle function by timed-stands test, timed up-and-go test, and handgrip test; muscle strength by one-repetition maximum test and handgrip test; body composition by densitometry; physical activity and metabolic equivalent by IPAQ, quality of life by HAQ and SF-36; disease activity by ITAS2010 and NIH score; and presence of comorbidities. Results Patients with TAK had a mean age of 41.5 (38.0–46.3) years, disease duration of 16.0 (9.5–20.0) years, and a mean BMI of 27.7±4.5 kg/m 2 . Three out of the 20 patients with TAK had active disease. Regarding comorbidities, 16 patients had systemic arterial hypertension, 11 had dyslipidemia, and two had type 2 diabetes mellitus, while the control group had no comorbidities. TAK had a significant reduction in aerobic capacity (absolute and relative VO 2 peak), muscle strength in the lower limbs, increased visceral adipose tissue, waist-to-hip ratio, reduced walking capacity, decreased weekly metabolic equivalent, and quality of life ( P &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls. However, there were no correlations between these MCRFs parameters and disease activity. Conclusions TAK show impairment in MCRFs; therefore, strategies able to improve MCRF should be considered in this disease.",

Over some decades, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the basis for the pharmacological treatment of patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, the emergence of the immunobiologic agents brought up the discussion about the role of NSAIDs in the management of these patients. The objective of this guideline is to provide recommendations for the use of NSAIDs for the treatment of axSpA. A panel of experts from the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials for 15 predefined questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess the quality of evidence and formulate recommendations were used, and at least 70% agreement of the voting panel was needed. Fourteen recommendations for the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of patients with axSpA were elaborated. The purpose of these recommendations is to support clinicians’ decision making, without taking out his/her autonomy when prescribing for an individual patient.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation consequent to immunosuppressive therapy is an increasingly prevalent problem with serious clinical implications. Treatment with biologic agents conduces to the loss of protective antibody to HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs), which significantly increases the risk of HBV reactivation. Hence, we investigated the risk factors for losing anti-HBs in patients with rheumatic diseases and HBV surface antigen negative/anti-HBs positive (HBsAg-/anti-HBs+) serostatus during treatment with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Using a nested case-control design, we prospectively enrolled patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis/psoriasis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who were treated with biologic DMARDs at Changhua Christian Hospital, Taiwan, from January 2013 to June 2019 and had HBsAg-/anti-HBs+ serostatus; the analytic sample excluded all patients with HBsAg+ or anti-HBs- serostatus. Anti-HBs titers were monitored 6-monthly and cases were defined as anti-HBs < 10 mIU/ml during follow-up. Cases were matched one-to-all with controls with anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/ml on the same ascertainment date and equivalent durations of biologic DMARDs treatment (control patients could be resampled and could also become cases during follow-up). Between-group characteristics were compared and risk factors for anti-HBs loss were investigated by conditional logistic regression analyses.Among 294 eligible patients, 23 cases were matched with 311 controls. The incidence of anti-HBs loss was ~ 2.7%/person-year during biologic DMARDs treatment. Besides lower baseline anti-HBs titer (risk ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97), cases were significantly more likely than controls to have diabetes mellitus (risk ratio 4.76, 95% CI 1.48-15.30) and chronic kidney disease (risk ratio 14.00, 95% CI 2.22-88.23) in univariate analysis. Risk factors remaining significantly associated with anti-HBs loss in multivariate analysis were lower baseline anti-HBs titer (adjusted risk ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.97) and chronic kidney disease (adjusted risk ratio 45.68, 95% CI 2.39-871.5).Besides lower baseline anti-HBs titer, chronic kidney disease also strongly predicts future anti-HBs negativity in patients with HBsAg-/anti-HBs+ serostatus who receive biologic DMARDs to treat rheumatic diseases. Patients with low anti-HBs titer (≤ 100 mIU/ml) and/or chronic kidney disease should be monitored during biologic DMARDs therapy, to enable timely prophylaxis to preempt potential HBV reactivation.",

Methods A literature-based search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases, and Cochrane Library databases to identify all relevant studies. And the association of TNFSF4 gene polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility was evaluated by pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The meta-analysis produced overall OR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.36–1.49, P &lt; 0.00001), 1.41 (95% CI 1.36–1.46, P &lt; 0.00001) and 1.34 (95% CI 1.26–1.42, P &lt; 0.00001) for the rs2205960, rs1234315 and rs704840 polymorphisms respectively, confirming these three SNPs confer a significant risk for the development of SLE. On the other hand, the meta-analysis produced overall OR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.70–1.21, P = 0.54) for the rs844644 polymorphism, suggesting no significant association. And no association was also found between either rs844648 1.11 (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86–1.43, P = 0.41) or rs10489265 (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94–1.47, P = 0.17) polymorphism with SLE susceptibility, respectively. Conclusions Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the TNFSF4 rs2205960, rs1234315 and rs844840 SNPs was significantly associated with an increased risk of SLE.",

However, the incidence and nature of cardiac involvement in BD have not been clearly documented yet. The aim of this study was to delineate the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearances of cardiac involvement in BD patients. Methods This cross-sectional observational study was carried out 30 BD patients without known cardiac disease. Patients were subjected to history taking, physical examination, echocardiography and cardiac MRI. Results At least one abnormality on cardiac MRI was observed in 20/30 patients (66.67%). Myocardial oedema was observed in 3 patients (10%) and late gadolinium enhancement in 1 patient (3.3%). Pericardial effusion was found in 3 patients (10.0%), global hypokinesia in 6 patients (20.0%) and intra-cardiac thrombosis in only 1 patient (3.3%). Pulmonary artery was dilated in 4 patients (13.3%). Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) end diastolic volume were altered in 4 patients (13.3%) and 7 patients (23.3%) respectively. LV and RV end systolic volume were abnormal in 7 patients (23.3%) and 5 patients (16.7%) respectively. There was aortic valve regurge in 2 patients (6.7%), tricuspid valve regurge in 9 patients (30%), and mitral valve regurge in 9 patients (30%). Dilated left main coronary artery was found in 2 patients (6.7%) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in only one patient 1 patient (3.3%). On logistic regression analysis, BD activity index score was a significant predictor of cardiac abnormalities. Conclusion BD may cause cardiac abnormalities without clinical manifestations and cardiac MRI may represent a tool for early detection of these subtle abnormalities. Higher BD activity index scores are strongly linked to cardiac problems.",

We evaluated changes in diagnostic and treatment delays regarding RA in the last decades in Brazil. Methods Adults fulfilling the ACR/EULAR (2010) criteria for RA were assessed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, and the frequencies of early management initiation within thresholds (windows of opportunity) of 3, 6, and 12 months from symptoms onset were evaluated. The Mann–Kendall trend test, chi-squared tests with Cramer’s V effect sizes and analysis of variance were conducted. Results We included 1116 patients: 89.4% female, 56.8% white, mean (SD) age 57.1 (11.5) years. A downward trend was found in diagnostic (tau = − 0.677, p &lt; 0.001) and treatment (tau = − 0.695, p &lt; 0.001) delays from 1990 to 2015. The frequency of early management increased throughout the period, with ascending effect sizes across the 3-, 6-, and 12-month windows (V = 0.120, 0.200 and 0.261, respectively).

Conclusion The delays in diagnosis and treatment of RA decreased during the last decades in Brazil. Improvements (effect sizes) were greater at eliminating extreme delays (≥ 12 months) than in attaining really short management windows (≤ 3 months).

However, data on the use of TNFi after discontinuation of non-TNFi bDMARDs or tsDMARDs (non-TNFi) are scarce. This study assessed the 4-years golimumab retention in patients with rheumatic diseases when used after discontinuation of non-TNFi. Methods Adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n = 72), psoriatic arthritis (PsA; n = 30) or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA; n = 23) who initiated golimumab after discontinuation of non-TNFi from the Spanish registry of biological drugs (BIOBADASER) were analyzed retrospectively. The retention rate (drug survival or persistence) of golimumab up to 4 years was evaluated. Results The golimumab retention rate was 60.7% (51.4–68.8) at year 1, 45.9% (36.0–55.2) at year 2, 39.9% (29.8–49.7) at year 3 and 33.4% (23.0–44.2) at year 4. Retention rates did not differ significantly whether golimumab was used as second, third, or fourth/subsequent line of therapy ( p log-rank = 0.462). Golimumab retention rates were higher in axSpA or PsA patients than in RA patients ( p log-rank = 0.002). When golimumab was administered as third or fourth/subsequent line, the 4-years retention rate after discontinuation of non-TNFi was similar to that after discontinuation of TNFi. Conclusion In patients who discontinued non-TNFi, most of whom received golimumab as third/subsequent line of therapy, one-third of patients remained on golimumab at year 4. Retention rates were higher in patients with axSpA and PsA than in those with RA.",

Meanwhile, the serum SOD levels of 150 healthy people were collected as the control group. Results Compared to the healthy control group, serum SOD levels of the AAV group were significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.001). SOD levels of AAV patients were negatively correlated to ESR, CRP, and BVAS (ESR rho = − 0.367, P &lt; 0.001; CRP rho = − 0.590, P &lt; 0.001; BVAS rho = − 0.488, P &lt; 0.001).

SOD levels for the pulmonary involvement group and the renal involvement group were significantly lower than those for the non-pulmonary involvement group and the non-renal involvement group ( P = 0.006; P &lt; 0.001, respectively). SOD levels in the death group were significantly lower than the survival group ( P = 0.001). Conclusions In AAV patients, low SOD levels might indicate disease associated oxidative stress. SOD levels in AAV patients were decreased with inflammation, suggesting that SOD levels could potentially be a surrogate marker for disease activity. SOD levels in AAV patients were closely related to ANCA serology, pulmonary involvement, and renal involvement, with low SOD levels an important indicator of a poor prognosis for AAV patients.",

Due to their immunomodulatory properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have come into focus as a potential therapeutic concept. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of MSCs on the phenotype, cytokine profile, and functionality of naive and non-naive CD4 + T-cells from healthy donors (HD) and patients with autoimmune arthritis under Th17-cytokine polarizing conditions in an explorative way using a transwell system prohibiting any cell–cell-contact. Methods Magnetically isolated naive and non-naive CD4 + T-cells were stimulated under Th17-polarizing proinflammatory cytokine conditions in presence and absence of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). After an incubation period of 6 days, the proportions of the T-cell subpopulations TEMRA (CD45RA + CD27 − ), memory (CD45RA − CD27 + ), effector (CD45RA − CD27 − ) and naive cells (CD45RA + CD27 + ) were determined. Quantitative immunofluorescence intensity was used as a measure for IL-9, IL-17 and IFN-γ production in each subpopulation . Results In isolated naive CD4 + T-cells from HD and patients, MSCs suppressed the differentiation of naive towards an effector phenotype while memory and naive cells showed higher percentages in culture with MSCs. In patients, MSCs significantly decreased the proportion of IL-9 and IL-17 producing effector T-cells. MSCs also reduced IFN-γ production in the naive and memory phenotype from HD. Conclusion The results of the study indicate significant immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, as under Th17-polarizing conditions MSCs are still able to control T-cell differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production in both HD and patients with autoimmune arthritis.",

Given that different cells of the immune system display different sensitivity to apoptosis, we set to evaluate the in vitro effect of SLE serum on regulatory T-cells (Treg), Th17, Th1 and Th2 from SLE patients and healthy controls.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients or normal controls were exposed to a pool of sera from SLE patients or normal controls. Annexin V was used to label cells in apoptosis or necrosis. Annexin V-labeled Treg, Th17, Th1 and Th2 cells were determined using flow cytometry.Total CD3 + and CD4 + cells from SLE patients showed higher frequency of spontaneous apoptosis/necrosis, whereas Th1 cells from SLE patients presented reduced spontaneous apoptosis/necrosis rate as compared with cells from controls. Incubation with SLE serum induced increased frequency of apoptotic/necrotic CD3 + , CD4 + and Th2 cells from normal controls or from SLE patients as compared with cultures incubated with normal human serum (NHS) or without human serum at all. Incubation with SLE serum did not increase the apoptosis/necrosis rate in Th1 or Th17 cells. Treg cells from SLE patients were more prone to apoptosis/necrosis induced by SLE serum than Treg cells from normal individuals. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells presented increased apoptosis rates in cultures without human serum.Our findings indicate that the serum of patients with active SLE stimulates apoptosis of CD4 + T cells in general and exhibit differentiated effects on CD4 + T-cell subsets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The defect of B cell self-tolerance and the continuous antigen presentation by T cells (TCs) mediated by autoreactive B cells (BCs) play a key role in the occurrence and development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis negatively regulates the immune response of TCs after activation and maintains immune tolerance. However, the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis on the interaction between CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs in the peripheral blood of patients with SLE has not been studied in detail. Methods PD-1/PD-L1 and Ki-67 levels in peripheral blood (PB) of 50 SLE patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs) were detected through flow cytometry, and then the expression of PD-1 +/− cells and PD-L1 +/− cells Ki-67 was further analyzed. CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs were separated for cell culture and the supernatant was collected to determine proliferation and differentiation of TCs. IL-10 and IFN-γ secretion in the supernatant was also determined using ELISA. Results The PD-1, PD-L1, and Ki-67 levels on CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs in patients with SLE were higher than HCs. In CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs of SLE patients, the proliferative activity of PD-L1 + cells was higher than that of PD-L1 − cells, and the proliferative activity of PD-1 + cells was higher than that of PD-1 − cells. In the system co-culturing CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs from HCs/SLE patients, activated BCs promoted TCs proliferation and PD-L1 expression among TCs. Addition of anti-PD-L1 to co-culture system restored the proliferation of TCs, and inhibited IL-10/IFN-γ level. The addition of anti-PD-L1 to co-culture system also restored Tfh and downregulated Treg in HCs. Conclusions Axis of PD-1/PD-L1 on CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs in PB of SLE patients is abnormal, and cell proliferation is abnormal. In CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs of SLE patients, the proliferative activity of PD-L1 + and PD-1 + cells compared with PD-L1 − and PD-1 − cells in SLE patients, respectively. CD19 + B/CD4 + TCs in SLE patients can interact through PD-1/PD-L1.",

Methods Participants who were diagnosed with a chronic IMID were eligible for inclusion in this study. Age- and sex-matched healthy vaccinated individuals were set as the control group. All participants received two doses of the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine or three doses of the recombinant protein subunit vaccine ZF2001. Adverse events, IMID activity after vaccination, and the rate of COVID-19 in the two groups were compared. Results There were 158 patients in the IMID group, with an average age of 40 ± 14 years old, and 98 female subjects. In the IMID group, 123 patients received the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine, and 35 patients received the recombinant protein subunit vaccine ZF2001. There were 153 individuals in the control group, including 122 who received the CoronaVac vaccine and 31 who received the recombinant protein subunit vaccine ZF2001. The frequency of vaccine-related adverse events in the IMID group was less than that in the control group, all of which were mild local effects, and no serious events occurred. Of note, no disease flares occurred in the IMID group. No participants in either group subsequently got COVID-19, so the incidence rate was 0% in both groups. Conclusion COVID-19 vaccination was found to be safe for IMID subjects, any adverse events were mild, and vaccination did not increase the risk of disease activity. Meanwhile, vaccination could effectively reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in IMID patients. In the future, studies with a larger sample size and a longer duration are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) virus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the last 50 years in population that is greater than the impact of H1N1. Data assessing immunogenicity and safety of this virus component in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is lacking in the literature. Objective To evaluate short-term immunogenicity and safety of influenza A/Singapore (H3N2) vaccine in JSLE. Methods 24 consecutive JSLE patients and 29 healthy controls (HC) were vaccinated with influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016(H3N2)-like virus. Influenza A (H3N2) seroprotection (SP), seroconversion (SC), geometric mean titers (GMT), factor increase in GMT (FI-GMT) titers were assessed before and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Disease activity, therapies and adverse events (AE) were also evaluated. Results JSLE patients and controls were comparable in current age [14.5 (10.1–18.3) vs. 14 (9–18.4) years, p = 0.448] and female sex [21 (87.5%) vs. 19 (65.5%), p = 0.108]. Before vaccination, JSLE and HC had comparable SP rates [22 (91.7%) vs. 25 (86.2%), p = 0.678] and GMT titers [102.3 (95% CI 75.0–139.4) vs. 109.6 (95% CI 68.2–176.2), p = 0.231]. At D30, JSLE and HC had similar immune response, since no differences were observed in SP [24 (100%) vs. 28 (96.6%), p = 1.000)], SC [4 (16.7%) vs. 9 (31.0%), p = 0.338), GMT [162.3 (132.9–198.3) vs. 208.1 (150.5–287.8), p = 0.143] and factor increase in GMT [1.6 (1.2–2.1) vs. 1.9 (1.4–2.5), p = 0.574]. SLEDAI-2K scores [2 (0–17) vs. 2 (0–17), p = 0.765] and therapies remained stable throughout the study. Further analysis of possible factors influencing vaccine immune response among JSLE patients demonstrated similar GMT between patients with SLEDAI &lt; 4 compared to SLEDAI ≥ 4 ( p = 0.713), as well as between patients with and without current use of prednisone ( p = 0.420), azathioprine ( p = 1.0), mycophenolate mofetil ( p = 0.185), and methotrexate ( p = 0.095). No serious AE were reported in both groups and most of them were asymptomatic (58.3% vs. 44.8%, p = 0.958). Local and systemic AE were alike in both groups ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion This is the first study that identified adequate immune protection against H3N2-influenza strain with additional vaccine-induced increment of immune response and an adequate safety profile in JSLE.

In this context, the aim of this study was to assess and compare these inflammatory cell phenotyping in muscle samples of treatment naive juvenile and adult patients with dermatomyositis. This is a cross-sectional study, in which 28 untreated juvenile and 28 adult untreated dermatomyositis patients were included. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on serial frozen muscle sections. Inflammatory cell phenotyping was analyzed quantitatively in endomysium, perimysium, and perivascular (endomysium and perimysium) area. Mean age at disease onset was 7.3 and 42.0 years in juvenile and adult dermatomyositis, respectively. Both groups had comparable time duration from symptom's onset to biopsy performance. CD4 and CD8 positive cells distributions were similar in both groups in all analyzed area, except for more predominance of CD4 in perimysium at juvenile muscle biopsies. The CD20 and CD68 positive cells were predominantly observed in adult muscle biopsy sections, when compared to juvenile samples, except for similar distribution of CD20 in perivascular endomysium, and CD68 in perimysium. These data show that the differences between juvenile and adult dermatomyositis may be restricted not only to patients' age, but also to different inflammatory cell distribution, particularly, in new-onset disease. Further studies are necessary to confirm the present study data and to analyze meaning of the different inflammatory cell phenotyping distribution finding in these both diseases.",

The modified version (mHAMIS), with 4 of the 9 original items, was developed later. The goal of the present study was to translate and validate HAMIS and mHAMIS into Brazilian Portuguese and culture. Methods After direct and reverse translation and comprehension test in 10 SSc patients, HAMIS-Br was applied to another 32 patients with SSc. To evaluate internal consistency, intraobserver and interobserver agreement, and intraobserver and interobserver reliability, we used respectively the Cronbach’s α coefficient, kappa concordance and intraclass correlation (ICC). The correlation between HAMIS-Br and mHAMIS-Br was evaluated and a factorial analysis was performed. Results HAMIS-Br showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.997), good intraobserver agreement (kappa between 0.78 [95%CI =0.57–0.99] and 1) and intraobserver and interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.993, 95% CI = 0.973–0.993 and ICC = 0.994, 95% CI = 0.987–0.997, respectively). The mHAMIS-Br presented similar results and excellent correlation with HAMIS-Br (r = 0.923). The factorial analysis extracted three groups of questions that explain 84.4% of the total variance, and that can be understood through the influence of certain movements in the interpretation of others: [1] questions whose interpretation is influenced by the extension of the fingers, [2] questions whose interpretation is influenced by flexion of the fingers, [3] volar flexion of the fingers, with similar correlation with both other factors. Conclusions HAMIS-Br and mHAMIS-Br showed good agreement, intraobserver and interobserver reliability, and internal validity. It is necessary to be attentive to the influence of certain limitations of movements in the interpretation of others.",

The study aimed to describe the ADRs investigating their severity and associated factors and resulting interventions in pediatric patients with CRDs.A retrospective, descriptive and analytical study was conducted on a cohort of children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). The study evaluated medical records of the patients to determine the causality and the management of ADRs. In order to investigate the risk factors that would increase the risk of ADRs, a logistic regression model was carried out on a group of patients treated with the main used drug.We observed 949 ADRs in 547 patients studied. Methotrexate (MTX) was the most frequently used medication and also the cause of the most ADRs, which occurred in 63.3% of patients, followed by glucocorticoids (GCs). Comparing synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) vs biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), the ADRs attributed to the former were by far higher than the latter. In general, the severity of ADRs was moderate and manageable. Drug withdrawal occurred in almost a quarter of the cases. In terms of risk factors, most patients who experienced ADRs due to MTX, were 16 years old or younger and received MTX in doses equal or higher than 0.6 mg/kg/week. Patients with JIA and JDM had a lower risk of ADRs than patients with JSLE. In the multiple regression model, the use of GCs for over 6 months led to an increase of 0.5% in the number of ADRs.Although the ADRs highly likely affect a wide range of children and adolescents with CRDs they were considered moderate and manageable cases mostly. However, triggers of ADRs need further investigations.",

Because of the poor understanding of signaling pathways involved in SLE muscle wasting, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on skeletal muscle in mice with pristane-induced lupus. Methods Balb/c mice with lupus-like disease induced by pristane injection were randomized into three groups: pristane-induced lupus (PIL; n = 10), pristane-induced lupus + vitamin D supplementation (PIL + VD; n = 10) and healthy controls (CO; n = 8). Physical function was evaluated on days 0, 60, 120 and 180. The tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were collected to evaluate myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and protein expression. Results The PIL + VD group showed lower muscle strength compared to the CO and PIL groups at different time points. PIL mice showed similar myofiber CSA compared to CO and PIL + VD groups. LC3-II expression was higher in PIL compared to CO and PIL + VD groups. MyoD expression was higher in PIL mice compared to PIL + VD, while myostatin expression was higher in PIL + VD than PIL group. Myogenin expression levels were decreased in the PIL + VD group compared with the CO group. The Akt, p62 and MuRF expressions and mobility assessment showed no significance. Conclusions Changes in skeletal muscle in PIL model happen before CSA reduction, possibly due to autophagy degradation, and treatment with Vitamin D has a impact on physical function by decreasing muscle strength and time of fatigue.. Vitamin D supplementation has a potential role modulating physical parameters and signaling pathways in muscle during pristane-induced lupus model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background/Objective The effects of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection on patients with rheumatic diseases have not been extensively studied. Our aim was to compare the clinical course of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis, categorized according to the use or not of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), during and after infection by CHIKV. Methods Patients from a northeastern Brazilian city that suffered an epidemic outbreak of Chikungunya fever (CHIK) between Oct 2015 and Jul 2016, on regular follow-up in a longitudinal registry of rheumatic patients (BiobadaBrasil), were invited to participate. Participants underwent a standardized clinical interview and collection of blood sample for serological tests (IgM/IgG) for CHIKV. A positive IgG was considered evidence of previous CHIKV infection. Results 105 patients (84 with rheumatoid arthritis, 17 with ankylosing spondylitis, and 4 with psoriatic arthritis) were evaluated. Most patients (58, 55.2%) were on therapy with bDMARDs. The overall prevalence of seropositivity for CHIKV was 47.6% (39.7% in patients on bDMARDs and 57.4% in those exclusively on conventional synthetic (cs-) DMARDs ( p = 0.070). Among seropositive patients, asymptomatic disease had similar frequency in those treated and not treated with bDMARDs (39.1% versus 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.670). However, patients exclusively on csDMARDs presented significantly higher prevalence of articular symptoms beyond 3 months and switched treatment more often than patients on bDMARDs ( p &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons). Conclusions Among rheumatic patients with CHIK, those on bDMARDs had shorter persistence of articular symptoms and switched treatment scheme less often than patients exclusively treated with csDMARDs.",

The classification rates among the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997, Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR 2019 criteria, and clinical and immunological involvements were compared between SLE patients with N-com and H-com. Relapse and organ damage based on the SLICC/ACR damage index were also evaluated.The classification rates of SLE were not significantly different in the ACR, SLICC, and EULAR/ACR criteria between the N-com and H-com groups. Patients with N-com had no significant differences in the classification rates among the three criteria, whereas patients with H-com had lower classification rates in the ACR criteria than in the SLICC criteria. A lower incidence of renal manifestation, less positivity for anti-dsDNA antibody, and a higher incidence of fever were observed in patients with N-com than in those with H-com. The occurrence of relapse and organ damage was not significantly different between patients with N-com and H-com.Patients with N-com were less involved in renal manifestation and anti-dsDNA antibody positivity but had a higher incidence of fever than those with H-com, while having no disadvantage in SLE classification processes. Serum complement levels at the initial diagnosis of SLE may not predict prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the working-age population and may cause key functional and work limitations. As the disease progresses, individuals become increasingly unable to conduct daily activities, which has a substantial personal and socioeconomic impact. Fairly recent prior studies showed that patients with RA stop working 20 years earlier than age-matched controls. Factors related to sociodemographic, clinical, care and disease profiles might affect the loss of work capacity. The purpose of this study was to assess the factors associated with the prevalence of working patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the municipality of Blumenau. A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted between July 2014 and January 2015, with 296 individuals aged 20 years or older, male and female, living in Blumenau, Santa Catarina state, Brazil, and diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria. The prevalence of working patients with RA was assessed by employment status self-reporting during the interview. The chi-squared test, Wald test and Poisson regression analysis were used to test the possible associations between the independent variables and outcome. The prevalence of working patients with rheumatoid arthritis was 44.3%. Patients aged 20 to 59 years had a 90% higher prevalence of outcome than subjects aged 60 years or older. The prevalence of working patients was 132% and 73% higher among individuals with low income and high functional disability, measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), respectively. The prevalence of working RA patients was highest among adult patients with low income and high functional disability. The first variable is directly related to the individual characteristic, the second reflects the socioeconomic context of the patient, and the third reflects the degree of disability caused by the disease, which may be modifiable by health professionals.",

Demographic data, JIA clinical/laboratory parameters and treatment were also assessed. The median current age [26.5 (17–38.1) vs. 29.3 (19.7–35.8) years, p = 0.700)] as well as age at the first sexual activity [18 (14–30) vs. 17 (10–24) years, p = 0.158] were similar in JIA patients and healthy controls.

The frequencies of all sexual domains (desire/sexual fantasies, desire/interest, arousal/foreplay, arousal/lubrication, arousal/in tune with partner, penetration/relaxation, pain/penetration, desire/involvement, orgasm and general satisfaction scores) were similar in JIA patients and healthy controls (p > 0.05). To our knowledge, this was the first study using a validated sexual score in a chronic arthritis population suggesting a low frequency of overall sexual dysfunction in young JIA patients.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the leading cause of ischemic stroke and is one of the most common arrhythmias. Previous studies have shown that impaired diastolic functions, P wave dispersion (Pd), and prolonged atrial conduction times (ACT) are associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to evaluate diastolic functions, Pd, and ACT in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients to determine whether there is an increase in the risk of developing AF. Methods The study included a total of 140 female patients (70 FMS group, 70 healthy control group). Pd was evaluated using 12 lead electrocardiography (ECG), and diastolic functions and ACT with echocardiography. The ECG and echocardiographic evaluations were performed by different cardiologists blinded to the clinical information of the subjects. Results There was no difference between the two groups in laboratory and clinical parameters. Patients with FMS had significantly higher echocardiographic parameters of ACT known as left-sided intra-atrial (13.9 ± 5.9 vs. 8.1 ± 1.8, p &lt; 0.001), right-sided intra-atrial (21.9 ± 8.2 vs. 10.4 ± 3.5, p &lt; 0.001) and interatrial [40 (25–64) ms vs. 23 (14–27) ms p &lt; 0.001] electromechanical interval (EMI) compared with the control group. Pd was significantly greater in the FMS group compared with the control group [46 (29–62) ms vs. 32 (25–37) ms, p &lt; 0.001]. In the FMS group, there was no significant relationship of the echocardiographic parameters of ACT, Pmax and Pd with age, E/A ratio and deceleration time (DT); while all these five parameters were significantly correlated with left atrial dimension, isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) and visual analogue scale (VAS). There was a strong correlation between FIQ and VAS and echocardiographic parameters of ACT, Pmax and Pd. Conclusions Impaired diastolic functions, an increase in Pd, and prolongation of ACT were observed in FMS. Current disorders are thought to be associated with an increased risk of AF in FMS. The risk of developing AF increases with the severity of FMS and clinical progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of skin and lung as well as involvement of kidney, gastrointestinal system and heart. Aetiology and exact mechanism of disease is poorly understood. The association between antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and other diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, pulmoner alveolar proteinosis and psoriasis have been reported. A small number of studies have examined the role of AMPs on autoimmune diseases which has not been studied in scleroderma yet. We aimed to investigate AMP serum levels and their association with disease characteristics of SSc. Methods Forty-two patients (40 female, mean age 42 years) and 38 healthy subjects (32 female, mean age 38 years) were enrolled. For SSc patients, the following data were recorded: disease subset (limited/diffuse), autoantibodies (antinuclear, anti-centromere (ACA), and anti-SCL-70), blood tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), modified Rodnan skin score, presence and history of digital ulcers, kidney, gastrointestinal disease and lung involvement assessed by computed tomography and pulmonary function tests. Association between serum AMPs and disease characteristics were analysed. Results Twenty-nine of the patients had diffuse (69%) and 13 of the patients had limited (31%) systemic sclerosis. Average disease duration was 5.5 years. Pulmonary involvement was detected in 20 patients (47.6%). Serum concentration of alpha defensin was higher than healthy subjects (563 ± 415 vs 377 ± 269 ng/mL, p = 0.02). However, no difference was observed for beta-1 and beta-2 defensins in SSc patients and healthy controls. In sub-group analysis patients with interstitial lung disease had higher levels of alpha defensin than those without lung involvement (684 ± 473 vs 430 ± 299 ng/ml, p = 0.04). There was also correlation between alfa defensin serum concentrations and CRP ( r = 0.34). Conclusions Alpha defensin levels are increased in scleroderma patients and correlated with lung involvement indicating a role in the pathogenesis of disease.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) is a simple, reliable, and reproducible specific instrument to evaluate hand OA that can be applied both in clinical practice and research protocols. In order to be used in Brazil, FIHOA has to be translated into Portuguese, culturally adapted and have the reliability of the translated FIHOA version tested, which is the purpose of this study. Methods The FIHOA was translated into Brazilian Portuguese and administered to 68 patients with hand OA recruited between May 2019 and February 2020. The test-retest was applied to 32 patients and the reliability was assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The internal consistency reliability was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. External construction validity was assessed using the Spearman’s correlation test between FIHOA and pain, assessed with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Cochin Hand Functional Scale (CHFS) and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Results The 30 participants that initially answered the translated version of the FiHOA did not report difficulties in understanding or interpreting the translated version. The test-retest reliability for the total score was strong ( r = 0.86; ICC = 0.89). Mean differences (1.37 ± 0.68) using Bland Altman’s analysis did not significantly differ from zero and no systematic bias was observed. Cronbach’s alpha was also high (0.89) suggesting a strong internal coherence in the test items. There were also correlations between FIHOA and the CHFS ( r = 0.88), HAQ ( r = 0.64) and pain in the hands both at rest ( r = 0.55) and in motion ( r = 0.44). Conclusion The translation of the FIHOA into Brazilian Portuguese proved a valid instrument for measuring the functional capacity of patients with hand OA who understand Brazilian Portuguese.",

Methodology A structured questionnaire regarding the BCA recommendations for detection and interpretations of autoantibodies in HEp-2 cells was applied to randomly selected rheumatologists. The results were tabulated using the Microsoft® Excel program, expressed as a simple percentage and the dichotomous data were analyzed using the Chi-square test and the Epi Info® program. Results Four hundred fuorteen rheumatologists participated in the study: 70% of them considered their knowledge of the HEp-2 IFA test satisfactory or excellent, and 43% said they knew the BCA recommendations in general, without distinguishing the edition of the BCA to which they refer. The Revista Brasileira de Rheumatologia/Advances in Rheumatology was the means of dissemination most consulted by specialists (50%). According to the rheumatologists’ opinion, the most relevant pattern was the homogeneous nuclear (78%) and 65% stated they were satisfied with the BCA recommendations at a level of satisfaction greater than or equal to 80%. There was no significant difference in the perception of rheumatologists from the several Brazilian geographic regions. Conclusion Brazilian rheumatologists are aware of the BCA guidelines and most are satisfied with the content published, considering that the BCA recommendations assist positively in the clinical practice. Most rheumatologists recognize the patterns associated with rheumatic autoimmune diseases and have used BCA recommendations to interpret the results of the HEp-2 IFA test.",

This study aims to objectively reveal lower extremity involvement in the peripheral predominant forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis through qualitative evaluations and to determine the effects of these involvements on exercise, function, and quality of life.Thirty-two patients with a history of peripheral arthritis and aged between 7 and 16 years participated in the study. Demographics, JIA subtype, disease duration, arthritis and deformities of the lower extremity, disease activity score, 6-min walk test (6MWT), cycling exercise test (CYC-E), childhood health assessment questionnaire (CHAQ), and pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQoL) scores were recorded. In case of clinical suspicion of arthritis, an ultrasonographic examination was performed for a definitive diagnosis. Regression analyses were performed to explore the most associated lower extremity involvement and patient characteristics for each of the dependent variables including 6MWT, CYC-E, CHAQ, and PedsQoL.Of the total number of patients, with a mean age of 12.91 (SD 2.37) years, 28.1% had knee arthritis, 15.6% foot arthritis, 12.5% hip arthritis, and 37.5% lower extremity deformity. The parameters that were most associated with CHAQ and PedsQoL were hip and knee arthritis, whereas CYC-E was found to be most associated with knee arthritis and height, and 6MWT was found to be most associated with hip arthritis, knee arthritis, and demographic characteristics.This study emphasizes the importance of hip and knee arthritis, which are among the determinants of walking endurance, function, and quality of life; and knee arthritis, which is among the determinants of cycling performance in JIA with lower extremity involvement.",

This study aimed to evaluate general dentists' knowledge about osteoporosis and their ability to identify patients with this disease by assessing mandibular cortical width (MCW) and mandibular cortical index (MCI) on panoramic dental radiographs using a visual method.In this cross-sectional study, an email questionnaire regarding the diagnosis and prevention of osteoporosis was sent to 20,773 dentists in 2016. Those who completed the questionnaire were invited to participate in radiomorphometric training and then to analyze the MCI and MCW of 114 panoramic radiographs of postmenopausal women who underwent both panoramic radiography and bone densitometry. Based on the radiomorphometric indices and while blinded to the densitometry results, the dentists determined whether they would indicate densitometry for these patients.The response rate was 2.3%: 485 dentists completed the questionnaire, and 50 evaluated panoramic radiographs using the MCW and MCI. All of them reported some knowledge about osteoporosis, but 41.6% demonstrated a misleading conceptualization of the disease. Approximately 90% reported minimal access to this information during graduation, and only 27.0% were exposed to the topic during their postgraduate studies. Interest in osteoporosis prevention was expressed by 70.7% of the respondents, and interest in learning the radiomorphometric indices was expressed by 99.0%. The sensitivity in the detection of low bone mineral density through the MCW and MCI was 52.9%, and the specificity was 64%.Brazilian dentists demonstrated insufficient knowledge about osteoporosis and a low ability to detect osteopenia or osteoporosis by applying radiomorphometric indices.",

Methods Post hoc analysis to identify baseline characteristics predictive of clinical remission in response to treatment with etanercept (ETN) plus methotrexate (MTX) in LA patients with moderate to severe MTX-resistant RA. We report data from the group of patients who received ETN 50 mg/week plus MTX (ETN + MTX, n = 281) in a clinical trial consisting of an initial 24-week open-label phase, followed by a 104-week extension. Remission was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) score &lt; 2.6. Cutoff values to dichotomize baseline variables maximizing the detection of remission were obtained from Receiver Operator Curve analyses. Baseline dichotomized and categorical variables were analyzed altogether in a stepwise logistic regression model. Odds of attaining response at Weeks 24 and 128 were estimated for each significant predictor. Results At Week 24 and Week 128, 27% (66/241) and 42% (91/219) of patients in the ETN + MTX group achieved remission. On average, patients achieving remission were younger and had lower baseline ESR, lower Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scores, lower total Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores, and lower visual analog scale (VAS) Pain scores compared with patients who did not achieve remission. The best subset of baseline variables predicting Week 24 remission in the stepwise regression model were age ≤ 49 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.93), body mass index (BMI) &gt; 28.5 kg/m 2 (OR 3.24), disease duration &gt; 3.7 years (OR 2.22), ESR ≤ 42 mm/h (OR 2.72), PGA ≤ 6 (OR 3.21), tender joint count ≤ 14 (OR 2.25), and total HAQ score ≤ 1.6 (OR 2.86). At Week 128, age ≤ 42 years (OR 2.21), SF-36 Mental Health Scale score &gt; 39.6 (OR 2.16), White race (OR 4.07), &gt; 18 swollen joints (OR 2.11), and VAS Pain ≤ 41 (OR 6.05) at baseline were the best subset of significant predictors of remission. Conclusions In LA patients with RA, younger age, higher BMI, longer disease duration, higher SF-36 Mental Health Scale score, higher swollen joint count, and overall lower disease activity predicted clinical response to ETN + MTX therapy.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation and agreement between rheumatologists after a training session dedicated to the standardization of synovitis assessment and compare its performance with a reference imaging modality such as musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSUS). Methods In this cross-sectional study, a total of 28 and 10 joints in RA patients were evaluated by physical examination and ultrasound (US), respectively. After participating in a training session, individual joint assessment for tenderness and swelling was performed by three rheumatologists. MSUS examination was performed separately by an experimented radiologist in a standardized manner, evaluating findings according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trial (OMERACT) guidelines. Results A total of 80 RA patients were included, with a mean Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28)-ESR of 4.02. The interobserver overall agreement and concordance rate in a total of 2240 joints assessed was 81.7% (k = 0.449, p &lt; 0.0001) for tender joints and 66% (k = 0.227, p &lt; 0.0001) for swollen joints. The overall concordance rate was fair (Fleiss' kappa = 0.21, p = 0.027) with an overall agreement of 67.18% yet, more joints were found to be swollen by the US assessment, compared to the physical examination (43% vs 39%). Conclusion In our study population, joint tenderness showed better interobserver agreement, correlation, and concordance rate than joint swelling. When comparing the US assessment to the physical examination, a fair overall concordance rate supports the need for the implementation of training sessions dedicated to standardization in rheumatology clinics.",

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the number of social security benefits granted due to incapacity for work in Brazil in patients with ICD M79 and variants in the period 2006-2015. There has been no previous study with data referring to work withdrawals caused by fibromyalgia in Brazil.Data for this study were obtained through an official Social Security platform. The disability and retirement benefits were analyzed.A total of 95,882 social security disability benefits were granted to ICD M79 and variants in the period from 2006 to 2015. Regarding gender, 69,420 benefits (72.3%) were granted to women and 26,562 (27.7%) to men. Regarding the types of benefits, we found 93,556 (97.5%) temporary withdrawals from work and 2426 (2.5%) permanent withdrawals. When comparing the initial and final years, we observed a significant reduction in the number of awards: 15,562 in 2006 to 6163 in 2015.Fibromyalgia was an important cause of withdrawal due to incapacity for work in Brazil, with consequent public health expenditure. These data may serve as a basis for new studies and can alert professionals of the need for adequate management of fibromyalgia to reduce work withdrawal and its consequences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hemorrhoid disease (HD) is one of the most common gastrointestinal complaints worldwide, affecting 4.4% of the general population in the United States. Since antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may lead to intra-abdominal thrombosis, one may expect that this condition can impact the risk for HD development. Additionally, as APS patients are more prone to thrombosis and treatment with anticoagulants may increase risk of bleeding, one may also infer that rates of HD complications may be higher in this scenario. Nevertheless, no data in these regards have been published until now. The objective of the present study is to evaluate frequency of HD and describe its complications rates in antiphospholipid syndrome APS patients. Methods We consecutively invited patients who fulfilled APS criteria to undergo proctological examination. After examination, patients were divided in two groups, based on the presence of HD, and compared regarding different clinical manifestations and antiphospholipid profile. We performed the analysis of the data, using chi-square and Mann Whitney U when applicable and considering a significance level of 0.05. Multivariate regression analysis included age and variables with p &lt; 0.10 in the bivariate analysis. Results Forty-one APS patients agreed to undergo proctological examination. All were female and overall median age was 43 (36–49). Seventeen (41.4%) patients were diagnosed with HD, with the following frequency distribution: 7 internal (41.2%), 4 external (23.5%) and 5 mixed hemorrhoids (29.4%). Of the internal hemorrhoids, 5 patients were classified as grade I (71.4%), 1 grade II (14.3%), and 1 grade IV (14.3%). Prior gestation ( p = 0.067) and constipation ( p = 0.067) correlated with a higher frequency of HD. In multivariate analysis, constipation remained as an important risk factor (OR 3.92,CI95% 1.03–14.2, p = 0.037). Five out of 17 patients (29.4%) reported anal bleeding, but it did not correlate with warfarin dose ( p = 0.949). Surgical treatment was indicated for 10 patients (58.8%). Other anorectal findings were anal fissure, plicoma, condyloma and one chlamydial retitis. Conclusion We found an unexpected high frequency of hemorrhoids in APS patients, with a great proportion requiring surgical treatment.",

The objective this study is to describe clinic and radiographic features in HTLV-1-infected individuals with complaints of joint pain. Methods Cross-sectional study enrolling HTLV-1-infected individuals with chronic joint pain, aged up to 75 years, both genders and seronegative controls with osteoarthritis. All participants underwent conventional radiography of the hips, knees and ankles. Results Eighty-one HTLV-1 infected patients and 30 subjects with osteoarthritis participated in the study. Polyarticular and symmetrical arthritis prevailed in the HTLV-1 positive group (54%), while oligoarticular and asymmetrical (44%) were more common in controls ( p &lt; 0.05). The frequency of enthesophytes (90%) in HTLV-1-infected patients was greater than in the control group (73%) ( p &lt; 0.05). Radiographic features were similar in HTLV-1 carriers and in patients with probable or definite HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. The presence of enthesophytes in the absence of joint space reduction or osteophytes was only observed in HTLV-1-infected individuals ( p &lt; 0.001). Magnetic resonance imaging of the ankles of five HTLV-1-infected patients and five controls demonstrated a higher frequency of enthesitis, bursitis and osteitis in the HTLV-1 infected group. Conclusion HTLV-1-associated arthropathy is clinically characterized by symmetrical polyarthralgia and the main radiological finding is the presence of enthesophytes in the absence of osteophytes and joint space narrowing.",

    "abstract": "Despite the criteria already established for the classification of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a radiographic and/or clinical knee OA diagnosis usually occurs in cases of fully manifest or more advanced disease, which can make health promotion, prevention, and functional rehabilitation in more advanced stages of the disease less effective. In addition, radiographic knee OA can generate more financial costs for health services. Therefore, developing and validating screening instruments to assess the probability of development and progression of knee OA would be of great value for both clinical practice and science.To cross-culturally adapt and investigate the measurement properties of the Knee OA Pre-screening Questionnaire Brazilian version.A total of 250 individuals of both sexes aged between 35 and 92 years [(mean (standard deviation): 63 (11) years old; 74.1 (15.1) kg; 1.59 (0.09) m; 29.38 (5.44) kg/m2] participated in this study. The cross-cultural adaptation and analyses of the measurement properties of the KOPS Brazilian version included: (1) assessment of conceptual and item equivalence; (2) assessment of semantic equivalence; (3) assessment of operational equivalence; and (4) assessment of measurement equivalence, reliability, and validity.Cronbach's alpha for the internal consistency among the six components of the KOPS Brazilian version was 0.71. The test-retest 72 h apart for each component resulted in a coefficient correlation intraclass ranging from 0.74 to 1.00. The probability of an individual randomly chosen from the population having KL ≥ 1 and KOPS Brazilian version ≥ 21 points was 0.74 (area under the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic - AUC of ROC); furthermore, the AUC for KL ≥ 2 and the KOPS Brazilian version ≥ 23 points was 0.77.The KOPS Brazilian version is a reliable and valid instrument for early screening of knee OA in individuals aged 35 years and over in the Brazilian context.",

Methods Mice (5/group) had their knees subjected to anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT), ACLT plus meniscectomy (MNCT) or sham surgery, sacrificed after 3, 7 or 14 days, had the articular cartilage evaluated under optical microscopy using Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) parameters as well as cartilage thickness, roughness, and a damage index using SEM. Results Alterations of the cartilage under optical microscopy were not significantly relevant among groups. SEM analysis revealed reduction of femoral and tibial cartilage thickness in ACLT and MNCT groups at 7 and 14 days, with increased cartilage roughness in MNCT group as early as 3 days postsurgery, being sustained up to 14 days. Articular damage index was significantly higher at 14 days post surgery in ACLT and MNCT vs control groups. Conclusion This is the first demonstration of very early quantitative changes in the cartilage of mice subjected to posttraumatic experimental OA using SEM, revealing increased roughness and thickness as early as 3 days post surgery. These changes may be used as early surrogates for later joint damage in experimental OA.",

The following radiographic alterations were more frequently observed in JIA patients than in controls: erosion (p < 0.001), altered condylar morphology (p < 0.001), disproportion between condylar process and the coronoid process (p < 0.001) and accentuated curve in the antegonial notch (p = 0.002). Twenty patients (14.6%) presented the four radiographic alterations simultaneously compared to only two controls (1.5%) (p < 0.001).Due to the difference in the frequency of findings in the PR of patients and controls, we concluded that PR has value as a screening tool. In the presence of major changes in the mandible head in the PR of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of JIA, MRI should be considered to detect an active inflammatory process in this joint.",

Due to the elusive mechanism of osteoarthritis (OA), we aimed to identify potential markers for OA and explore the molecular mechanisms underlying OA.Expression profiles data of OA were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) in OA. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were performed. Then, nearby DEmRNAs of DElncRNAs was obtained. Moreover, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of nearby DEmRNAs of DElncRNAs was performed. Finally, expression validation of selected mRNAs and lncRNAs was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.In total, 2080 DEmRNAs and 664 DElncRNAs were determined in OA. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Endocytosis and Rap1 signaling pathway were significantly enriched KEGG pathways in OA. YWHAB, HSPA8, NEDD4L and SH3KBP1 were four hub proteins in PPI network. The AC093484.4/TRPV2 interact pair may be involved in the occurrence and development of OA.Our study identified several DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs associated with OA.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that often leads patients to muscle impairment and physical disability. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the activity of proteasome system in skeletal muscles of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and treated with etanercept or methotrexate. Methods Male DBA1/J mice were divided into four groups (n = 8 each): CIA-Vehicle (treated with saline), CIA-ETN (treated with etanercept, 5.5 mg/kg), CIA-MTX (treated with methotrexate, 35 mg/kg) and CO (healthy control group). Mice were treated two times a week for 6 weeks. Clinical score and hind paw edema were measured. Muscles were weighted after euthanasia and used to quantify proteasome activity, gene (MuRF-1, PMSα4, PSMβ5, PMSβ6, PSMβ7, PSMβ8, PSMβ9, and PSMβ10), and protein (PSMβ1, PSMβ5, PSMβ1i, PSMβ5i) expression of proteasome subunits. Results Both treatments slowed disease development, but only CIA-ETN maintained muscle weight compared to CIA-MTX and CIA-Vehicle groups. Etanercept treatment showed caspase-like activity of 26S proteasome similar to CO group, while CIA-Vehicle and CIA-MTX had higher activity compared to CO group ( p : 0.0057). MuRF-1 mRNA expression was decreased after etanercept administration compared to CIA-Vehicle and CO groups ( p : 0.002, p : 0.007, respectively). PSMβ8 and PSMβ9 mRNA levels were increased in CIA-Vehicle and CIA-MTX compared to CO group, while CIA-ETN presented no difference from CO. PMSβ6 mRNA expression was higher in CIA-Vehicle and CIA-MTX groups than in CO group. Protein levels of the PSMβ5 subunit were increased in CO group compared to CIA-Vehicle; after both etanercept and methotrexate treatments, PSMβ5 expression was higher than in CIA-Vehicle group and did not differ from CO group expression ( p : 0.0025, p : 0.001, respectively). The inflammation-induced subunit β1 (LMP2) was enhanced after methotrexate treatment compared to CO group ( p : 0.043). Conclusions The results of CIA-Vehicle show that arthritis increases muscle proteasome activation by enhanced caspase-like activity of 26S proteasome and increased PSMβ8 and PSMβ9 mRNA levels. Etanercept treatment was able to maintain the muscle weight and to modulate proteasome so that its activity and gene expression were compared to CO after TNF inhibition. The protein expression of inflammation-induced proteasome subunit was increased in muscle of CIA-MTX group but not following etanercept treatment. Thus, anti-TNF treatment may be an interesting approach to attenuate the arthritis-related muscle wasting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis caused by increased serum uric acid levels. Untreated or insufficiently treated gout can lead to deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, cartilage, and kidneys. Although Tongfengding capsules, a Chinese patent medicine, have long been used to treat gout, their effects and safety have not been reviewed systematically. This study evaluated its efficacy and safety for gout in adults. Methods Randomized controlled trials involving Tongfengding capsule for gout in adults were searched from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CBM, CNKI, and VIP databases, and analyzed using the Cochrane Handbook criteria. The primary outcome measures were the total effective rate. The secondary outcome measures including the blood uric acid (BUA), 24-h urinary total protein (24-h UTP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and adverse effects. The risk of bias was evaluated in all included studies. RevMan ver. 5.3.5 and GRADE profiler was used for data analysis and assessing the quality of evidence, respectively. Results Six studies (n = 607 Chinese participants) were included. Tongfengding capsules plus conventional treatment significantly increased the total effective rate (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11–1.33), while reducing the BUA (MD − 66.05 µmol/L, 95% CI − 81.26 to − 50.84), 24-h UTP (MD − 0.83 g/24 h, 95% CI − 0.96 to − 0.70), BUN (MD − 0.90 mmol/L, 95% CI − 1.60 to − 0.20), IL-6 (MD − 6.99 ng/L, 95% CI − 13.22 to − 0.75), IL-8 (MD − 12.17 ng/L, 95% CI − 18.07 to − 6.27), TNF-α (MD − 8.50 ng/L, 95% CI − 15.50 to − 1.51), and adverse effects (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04–0.95). Conclusion Tongfengding capsules plus conventional treatment is safe and beneficial for adults with gout compared with conventional treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic granulomatous vasculitis that affects large vessels and usually begins in women of childbearing age, so it is not uncommon for pregnancies to occur in these patients. However, there is limited information about these pregnancies, with reports of adverse maternal and obstetric outcomes. The objective of this study is to evaluate adverse maternal, fetal and neonatal events in pregnant patients with TA. Methods This is a cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection. We reviewed 22 pregnancies in 18 patients with TAK, according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, that were followed up in a high-risk prenatal clinic specialized in systemic autoimmune diseases and thrombophilia (PrAT) at Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto, from 1998 to 2021. Results In twenty-two pregnancies, the mean age of patients was 28.09 years and the mean duration disease was 10.9 years. Of the 18 patients with TAK studied, only one had the diagnosis during pregnancy and had active disease. All other patients had a previous diagnosis of TAK and only 3 had disease activity during pregnancy. Twelve patients (66.6%) had previous systemic arterial hypertension and eleven (61.1%) had renal involvement. Among maternal complications, eight patients (36.3%) developed preeclampsia and six (27.2%) had uncontrolled blood pressure without proteinuria, while 10 (45%) had puerperal complications. Four (18.1%) births were premature, all due to severe preeclampsia and eight newborns (34.7%) were small for gestational age. When all maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes included in this study were considered, only 6 (27.2%) pregnancies were uneventful. Conclusion Although there were no maternal deaths or pregnancy losses in this study, the number of adverse events was considerably high. Hypertensive disorders and small for gestational age newborns were more common than general population, while the number of patients with active disease was low. These findings suggest that pregnancies in patients with TAK still have several complications and a high-risk prenatal care and delivery are necessary for these patients.",

However, there is lack of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic data in spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients. Aim To evaluate the impact of HLA-B27 gene positivity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 and disease activity in axial SpA patients. Methods The ReumaCoV-Brasil is a multicenter, observational, prospective cohort designed to monitor immune-mediated rheumatic diseases patients during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil. Axial SpA patients, according to the ASAS classification criteria (2009), and only those with known HLA-B27 status, were included in this ReumaCov-Brasil’s subanalysis. After pairing them to sex and age, they were divided in two groups: with (cases) and without (control group) COVID-19 diagnosis. Other immunodeficiency diseases, past organ or bone marrow transplantation, neoplasms and current chemotherapy were excluded. Demographic data, managing of COVID-19 (diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, including hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death), comorbidities, clinical details (disease activity and concomitant medication) were collected using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. Data are presented as descriptive analysis and multiple regression models, using SPSS program, version 20. P level was set as 5%. Results From May 24th, 2020 to Jan 24th, 2021, a total of 153 axial SpA patients were included, of whom 85 (55.5%) with COVID-19 and 68 (44.4%) without COVID-19. Most of them were men (N = 92; 60.1%) with mean age of 44.0 ± 11.1 years and long-term disease (11.7 ± 9.9 years). Regarding the HLA-B27 status, 112 (73.2%) patients tested positive. There were no significant statistical differences concerning social distancing, smoking, BMI (body mass index), waist circumference and comorbidities. Regarding biological DMARDs, 110 (71.8%) were on TNF inhibitors and 14 (9.15%) on IL-17 antagonists. Comparing those patients with and without COVID-19, the HLA-B27 positivity was not different between groups (n = 64, 75.3% vs. n = 48, 48%, respectively; p = 0.514). In addition, disease activity was similar before and after the infection. Interestingly, no new episodes of arthritis, enthesitis or extra-musculoskeletal manifestations were reported after the COVID-19. The mean time from the first symptoms to hospitalization was 7.1 ± 3.4 days, and although the number of hospitalization days was numerically higher in the B27 positive group, no statistically significant difference was observed (5.7 ± 4.11 for B27 negative patients and 13.5 ± 14.8 for B27 positive patients; p = 0.594). Only one HLA-B27 negative patient died. No significant difference was found regarding concomitant medications, including conventional or biologic DMARDs between the groups. Conclusions No significant difference of COVID-19 frequency rate was observed in patients with axial SpA regarding the HLA-B27 positivity, suggesting a lack of protective effect with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the disease activity was similar before and after the infection.

The aim of the present study was to analyze neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels in the urine, and to investigate whether it may be used as an early marker for renal involvement.Forty attack-free children followed by diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever with age range of 5 and 18 years, and 38 healthy children with similar ages and genders were enrolled into the study. Hemogram, sedimentation, C-reactive protein, urine analysis, creatinine in the spot urine, microalbumin and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were analyzed and evaluated statistically in the patients and controls.There was not any statistically significant difference between the patient and control groups for age, gender, height and body weight. Although there was not any clinical sign of attack in the patient group, sedimentation, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.002, p = 0.023, and p = 0.006, respectively). Similarly, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level and urinary creatinine ratio were significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.0001, p = 0.011, respectively).

The secondary objective was to correlate performance tests with accelerometry.In this cross-sectional study, 54 community-dwelling women ≥60 years were subjected to Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), performance tests (Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, and Gait analysis), and radiographic analysis of sagittal alignment (Thoracic and Lumbar Cobb, Pelvic Incidence, Sacral Slope, and Pelvic Tilt angles). Gait speed was assessed in a 10-m comfortable walk, and accelerometry parameters were obtained in a 30-m walk distance.The sample, aged 72 ± 6 years, exhibited moderate correlation between Sacral Slope and Step Length (+ 0.615).

Lumbar Cobb weakly correlated with the following accelerometry data in the AP plane: Step Length (+ 0.405), RMS, (+ 0.392), and Stride Regularity (+ 0.345), p < 0.05, all. Additionally, Stride Regularity in AP moderately correlated with FES-I (0,561, p < 0.05), among other weak correlations between performance tests and accelerometry data in AP.Early alterations in Sacral Slope and gait abnormalities in the AP plane may provide understanding of the early gait changes in robust older women.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by episodes of thrombosis, obstetric morbidity or both, associated with persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Studying the profile of a rare disease in an admixed population is important as it can provide new insights for understanding an autoimmune disease. In this sense of miscegenation, Brazil is characterized by one of the most heterogeneous populations in the world, which is the result of five centuries of interethnic crosses of people from three continents. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Brazilian vs. non-Brazilian primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) patients. Methods We classified PAPS patients into 2 groups: Brazilian PAPS patients (BPAPS) and PAPS patients from other countries (non-BPAPS). They were compared regarding demographic characteristics, criteria and non-criteria APS manifestations, antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profile, and the adjusted Global Antiphospholipid Syndrome Score (aGAPSS). Results We included 415 PAPS patients (88 [21%] BPAPS and 327 [79%] non-BPAPS). Brazilian patients were significantly younger, more frequently female, sedentary, obese, non-white, and had a higher frequency of livedo (25% vs. 10%, p &lt; 0.001), cognitive dysfunction (21% vs. 8%, p = 0.001) and seizures (16% vs. 7%, p = 0.007), and a lower frequency of thrombocytopenia (9% vs. 18%, p = 0.037). Additionally, they were more frequently positive for lupus anticoagulant (87.5% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.01), and less frequently positive to anticardiolipin (46.6% vs. 73.7%, p &lt; 0.001) and anti-ß2-glycoprotein-I (13.6% vs. 62.7%, p &lt; 0.001) antibodies. Triple aPL positivity was also less frequent (8% vs. 41.6%, p &lt; 0.001) in Brazilian patients. Median aGAPSS was lower in the Brazilian group (8 vs. 10, p &lt; 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, BPAPS patients still presented more frequently with livedo, cognitive dysfunction and sedentary lifestyle, and less frequently with thrombocytopenia and triple positivity to aPL. They were also less often white. Conclusions Our study suggests a specific profile of PAPS in Brazil with higher frequency of selected non-criteria manifestations and lupus anticoagulant positivity. Lupus anticoagulant (not triple positivity) was the major aPL predictor of a classification criteria event.",

This study aims to clarify if the IIM patients initiated with fever are associated with poorer outcomes. Methods This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from 79 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive IIM patients in the Affiliated Wuxi People’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Wuxi, Jiangsu, China) from November 2016 to June 2020. According to the presence or absence of fever at the onset, the IIM patients were divided into two groups(fever group n = 28, without fever group n = 51) Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment, and outcomes were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to compare the all-cause mortality, relapse rate, and acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (AE-ILD) incidence. The association of fever with the outcomes was assessed in the unadjusted and adjusted forward logistic regression model. Results Compared with the non-fever group, the age at onset of the fever group was higher, and mechanic’s hands (MH) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) were more common. Systemic inflammation (CRP and ESR) was significantly higher in the fever group, while the level of albumin(ALB) and muscle enzymes were lower. The fever group seemed to be received more aggressive treatment, with higher dose glucocorticoids and higher rates of intravenous immunoglobulins(IVIG) use. The all-cause mortality rate and the incidence rate of AE-ILD were higher in the fever group. Even adjusted for the age at onset and treatments, fever was significantly associated with AE-ILD and all-cause mortality. Conclusion Our study has demonstrated that fever at initial diagnosis is associated with AE-ILD and mortality. Fever should serve as an early clinical warning sign for poor outcomes in IIM patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The diagnostic and prognostic relevance of Human Leukocyte Antigen B-27 (HLA-B27) in Axial Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) is undeniable, with 70% of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) patients carrying the B27 gene, contrasted with a mere 4.35% in the general population. Flow cytometry (FC) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) have emerged as the predominant techniques for routine HLA-B27 typing. While various studies have compared these methods, none have catered to the unique characteristics of the Brazilian demographic. Therefore, this research aims to compare FC and PCR in a Brazilian cohort diagnosed with AxSpA. Methods An analytical cross-sectional study was undertaken involving 62 AxSpA outpatients from a Brazilian University Hospital. Both FC and PCR-SSP assays were utilized to ascertain HLA-B27 typing. The outcomes (either confirming or refuting the allele’s presence) underwent rigorous scrutiny. Agreement between the methodologies was assessed using the kappa statistic. A p -value of &lt; 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results Of the participants, 90.3% ( n = 56) were HLA-B27 positive according to FC, while 79% ( n = 49) were identified as positive using the PCR method. FC exhibited a sensitivity rate of 98% paired with a specificity of 38.5%. The Positive Predictive Value for FC stood at 85.7%, and the Negative Predictive Value was 83.5%. Consequently, the overall accuracy of the FC method was gauged at 85.5%. A kappa coefficient of κ = 0.454 was derived. Conclusions FC demonstrated noteworthy sensitivity and satisfactory accuracy in HLA-B27 detection, albeit with a reduced specificity when contrasted with PCR-SSP. Nevertheless, given its cost-effectiveness and streamlined operation relative to PCR, FC remains a pragmatic option for preliminary screening in clinical practice, especially in low-income regions. To optimize resource allocation, we advocate for a refined algorithm that initiates by assessing the relevance of HLA-B27 typing based on Choosing Wisely recommendations. It then leans on FC, and, if results are negative yet clinical suspicion persists, advances to PCR. This approach aims to balance diagnostic accuracy and financial prudence, particularly in regions contending with escalating medical costs.",

Currently, there are no well-validated biomarkers to assess this risk in this population. Previous research in different cohorts has linked serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and its polymorphisms to accelerated atherosclerosis and a marker of poor prognosis in CVD. Thus, we assessed this protein as a potential biomarker of CVD in TAK patients. Objectives To evaluate the serum levels of OPG and its SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in TAK patients and healthy controls, and to associate these parameters with clinical data. Methods This bicentric cross-sectional study included TAK patients who were compared with healthy individuals (control group). The serum levels of OPG and the frequency of OPG SNPs [1181G &gt; C (rs2073618), 245 A &gt; C (rs3134069), 163T &gt; C (rs3102735), and 209 C &gt; T (rs3134070)] were compared between the both groups and associated with clinical data.

In an additional analysis of only TAK patients, serum OPG levels and its four genes were not associated with any CVD parameters, except for higher OPG levels among patients without dyslipidemia. Conclusion No significant differences were observed in serum OPG levels or in the genotype frequencies of OPG SNPs between the patient and control groups.

However, there is a lack of information regarding atherogenic pattern and lipoprotein subfractions burden in these individuals. Aim To evaluate the HDL and LDL-cholesterol plasmatic levels and their subfractions after a nutritional intervention in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a 12-week nutritional intervention. PsA patients were randomly assigned to 1-Placebo: 1 g of soybean oil daily, no dietetic intervention; 2-Diet + Supplementation: an individualized diet, supplemented with 604 mg of omega-3 fatty acids, three times a day; and 3-Diet + Placebo: individualized diet + 1 g of soybean oil. The LDL subfractions were classified as non-atherogenic (NAth), atherogenic (Ath) or highly atherogenic (HAth), whereas the HDL subfractions were classified as small, medium, or large particles, according to the current recommendation based on lipoproteins electrophoresis. Results A total of 91 patients were included in the study. About 62% of patients ( n = 56) had an Ath or HAth profile and the main risk factors associated were male gender, longer skin disease duration and higher BMI. Thirty-two patients (35%) had a high-risk lipoprotein profile despite having LDL plasmatic levels below 100 mg/dL. The 12-week nutritional intervention did not alter the LDL subfractions. However, there were significant improvement of HDL subfractions. Conclusion Recognizing the pro-atherogenic subfractions LDL pattern could be a relevant strategy for identifying PsA patients with higher cardiovascular risk, regardless total LDL plasmatic levels and disease activity. In addition, a short-term nutritional intervention based on supervised and individualized diet added to omega-3 fatty acids changed positively the HDL LARGE subfractions, while LDL LARGE subfraction was improved in hypercholesterolemic individuals.

The aim of this study was to analyze the demographic, clinical, and laboratory information of patients referred to a specialized rheumatological care unit because of positive antinuclear antibody. Methods This is a retrospective study of 99 out of 1670 patients seen by the same rheumatologist between 01/01/2011 and 01/01/2019. Patients whose referrals were exclusively due to the ANA test result and the specialist’s final diagnosis being “abnormal finding of serum immunological test” (ICD-10 R769) were included. Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory information were extracted from the consulting rheumatologist’s chart. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Results A total of 99 patients were included, most of whom were female (84.8%) with a median age of 49 years. At the moment of specialist’s appointment, 97 patients (97.9%) repeated the ANA test, and 77 patients remained positive. Of these, only 35 (35.35%) were in a high titer range (greater than or equal to 1:320). Complete blood count for cytopenia’s investigation was not performed in a high percentage of patients (22.2%), as well as urinalysis (31.3%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the context of rheumatoid arthritis and its systemic inflammatory implications, there is an increasing interest in investigating the role of prolactin in the clinical and metabolic aspects of the disease. This study aimed to explore the potential links between serum prolactin levels, serum glucose levels, and the clinical manifestations of arthritis. Methods This exploratory, cross-sectional, observational study focused on women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. The research involved assessing prolactin and blood glucose concentrations, alongside specific clinical traits such as disease-related inflammation, morning stiffness, and fatigue intensity. The presence of changes in serum prolactin (PRL) was initially compared among the groups based on disease activity intensity. Using a multinomial regression analysis, the study analyzed the impact of predetermined clinical and metabolic factors on various categories of prolactin concentration. Results Out of the 72 participants included in the study, hyperprolactinemia was detected in 9.1% of the sample. No differences in serum PRL were identified among the evaluated groups based on disease activity. Following multivariate analysis, no statistically significant differences were identified for the outcomes of inflammatory activity and morning stiffness within each PRL category when compared to the reference category for PRL. There was no increased likelihood of encountering blood glucose levels below 100 mg/dl among individuals with higher prolactin concentrations compared to those in the lowest prolactin category (OR 5.43, 95% CI 0.51–58.28). The presence of clinically significant fatigue revealed a higher likelihood of encountering this outcome among patients with intermediate PRL values (prolactin categories 7.76–10.35 with OR 5.18, 95% CI 1.01–26.38 and 10.36–15.29 with OR 6.25, 95% CI 1.2–32.51) when compared to the reference category. Conclusions The study found no discernible correlation between prolactin concentrations and worse scores for inflammatory activity of the disease, nor between prolactin concentrations and serum glucose levels. The findings regarding fatigue should be approached with caution given the exploratory nature of this study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has been known to have auto-inflammatory nature; hence, the efficacy of autoantibodies is low. However, studies on autoantibodies are ongoing, with some studies showing associations. Previous studies showed that anti-protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A) IgG was increased in patients with AS and associated with radiographic progression. However, the diagnostic usefulness was limited due to relatively low sensitivity and specificity. This pilot study evaluated the diagnostic utility of anti-PPM1A-IgM and anti-PPM1A-IgG in patients with active AS. Methods Serum samples were obtained from the registry cohort of a single tertiary center in Korea. Serum levels of anti-PPM1A-IgG/IgM were measured by direct ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to predict the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serum anti-PPM1A-IgG/IgM. Results Samples were collected from 28 patients with active AS, 16 healthy controls (HCs), and 28 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although total serum IgM was lower in the RA and AS groups than in the HC group, anti-PPM1A-IgM was significantly lower in the AS group than in the other groups. In evaluating the diagnostic utility of anti-PPM1A-IgG/IgM for AS patients compared with HCs, the area under the curve (AUC) of anti-PPM1A-IgM was 0.998 (sensitivity 96.4%, specificity 100.0%). When ROC analysis of anti-PPM1A-IgM for AS patients compared with RA patients was conducted, sensitivity was 78.6% and specificity was 71.4%, with an AUC of 0.839. Conclusion Decreased anti-PPM1A-IgM levels in AS patients suggests a potential role for anti-PPM1A-IgM in the diagnosis of active AS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Psoriatic arthritis can involve several domains. Due to its multifaceted nature and its frequent comorbidities such as depression, obesity, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, it is difficult to monitor these patients because the clinical scores involve subjective data. High-resolution ultrasound probes allowed the evaluation of more superficial structures, such as the nails and their synovio-entheseal framework, in close relationship with the enthesis of the distal extensor digitorum tendon. Nail ultrasound studies vary in terms of the parameters and fingers studied and in their findings. Objectives To describe the most significant sonographic nail changes and the most affected fingers in psoriatic arthritis and to verify the association of nail ultrasound findings with clinical scores (nail psoriasis severity index (NAPSI), ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score with C-reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), minimal disease activity (MDA), disease activity index for psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA)). Methods This was a cross-sectional study with 52 patients with psoriatic arthritis at the Hospital de Clínicas do Paraná and 50 controls. A total of 1016 nails were analyzed (517 from patients with psoriatic arthritis and 499 from controls). Ultrasonography of the nails of the 10 fingers was performed to assess the trilaminar appearance, measure the distance from the nail bed, identify synovitis of the distal interphalangeal joints and the presence of a power Doppler signal from the nail matrix/nail bed. The captured images were independently evaluated by a rheumatologist with expertise in musculoskeletal ultrasound. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v.28.0.0 software, and the association of nail plate changes, nail bed distance and power Doppler signal with the NAPSI, DAPSA, MDA and ASDAS-PCR were calculated. Spearman correlation coefficients were estimated to analyze the correlations between pairs of quantitative variables. Student’s t test and the Mann‒Whitney U test were used to compare quantitative variables, and Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables between patients and controls. The nonparametric Mann‒Whitney U and Kruskal‒Wallis tests were used to compare groups according to the MDA or DAPSA classification. Results The Doppler signal of the nail matrix and nail bed was more frequently identified in patients (44.2%) than in controls (6%), and the difference in the mean power Doppler signal between the two groups was significant ( p &lt; 0.001). Changes in the nail plate were more common in the right thumb (44.2%), left thumb (36.5%) and second finger on the right hand (32.7%). The number of fingers with nail plate changes, enthesitis, paratendinitis, grayscale synovitis and DIP involvement in the distal interphalangeal joints was higher among patients with psoriatic arthritis ( p &lt; 0.001). There were found some correlations between US findings and clinical scores: ultrasound nail involvement and the NAPSI score ( p = 0.034), the number of fingers and mean change in the nail plate and the ASDAS-CRP ( p = 0.030). DAPSA (remission/low activity versus moderate/high activity) was associated to the mean change in the nail plate ( p &lt; 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Nail ultrasound has the potential to assist in the capturing of the actual disease activity status in patients with psoriatic arthritis.",

We intend to contribute to fill this gap presenting clinical characteristics of our low-income HOA cohort (LIHOA). Methods Data from 119 patients with a HOA diagnosis fulfilling ACR criteria seen between August 2019 and May 2023 in Fortaleza/Brazil. Evaluations included pain (VAS, visual analogue scale), X-ray (KL, Kellgren-Lawrence), grip and pinch strength (KgF), Cochin hand functional scale (CHFS), FIHOA, and SF-12 scores. Social data included monthly (&lt;1, 1≥/&lt;3, ≥3 MW) minimum wage earnings, occupation, and literacy [&lt;/≥ 9 school-years (SY)]. Results 107 out of the 119 patients were included. Mean age was 61.9 (±10.3) years with 94 (92%) women. Systemic arterial hypertension (48%), metabolic syndrome (42.8%), dyslipidemia (28.4%), and obesity (25%) were the most common comorbidities. Mean disease duration was 7.5 ± 7.1 years. Median VAS values at rest and activity were 3 (3–5) and 8 (5–9), respectively ( p &lt; 0.001). Fifty-seven (56.4%) patients had ≥4 symptomatic joints with a median of 4 (2–8) painful joints at activity. The 2nd distal interphalangeal (IF), joint was the most symptomatic (21; 23.3%) and most had &gt;4 IF nodes. OA in other joints: 37 (36.2%) spine, 28 (29.4%) knee, 21 (20.5%) bunions. Functional impairment was mild [8 (5–14) median FIHOA]. Median serum CRP was 0.2 mg/dL (0.1–0.4) with 14 (20%) patients above reference value. Mean total KL score was 27.6 ± 13.6 with 21 (23%), 38 (41.7%), and 33 (36.2%) KL2, KL3, and KL4, respectively; 51 (54.8%) and 42 (45.2%) patients declared &lt;/≥3 MW earnings, respectively.

Numerous forms of physical training for this population have been studied through high-quality randomized clinical trials involving strength, flexibility, aerobic conditioning and multicomponent exercise interventions. This research evaluated the effectiveness of a functional exercise program at reducing pain, improving functional capacity, increasing muscle strength as well as improving flexibility, balance and quality of life in individuals with fibromyalgia. Methods Eighty-two women with fibromyalgia were randomized into two groups. The functional exercise group performed functional exercises in 45-minute sessions twice per week for 14 weeks. The stretching exercise group performed flexibility exercises with the same duration and frequency. Outcome measures were: visual analog scale for widespread pain; Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire for health-related quality of life; Timed Up and Go test for functional performance; one-repetition maximum for muscle strength, Sit and Reach test on Wells bench for flexibility; Berg Balance Scale for balance; SF-36 for general quality of life. Results After the intervention, the functional exercise group had a statistically significant reduction in pain (interaction p = 0.002), and improvement in health-related quality of life measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (interaction p &lt; 0.001) and in general health state domain of SF-36 (interaction p = 0.043) compared to the stretching exercise group.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Sarcopenia is a muscle disease characterized by reduction of muscle strength and muscle mass. In RA, 25.9 to 43.3% of the patients present sarcopenia. The loss of muscle mass observed in RA patients occurs either by activation of catabolic pathways or by inhibition of anabolic pathways. Despite having a list of drugs capable of treating RA inflammation, their effect on muscle is unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the tofacitinib effect on the muscle mass of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. Methods CIA was induced in male DBA/1J mice by subcutaneous injection of Type 2 Collagen plus Freund Adjuvant. Animals were randomized into 3 groups: CIA + tofacitinib; CIA + vehicle; and healthy controls. Treatment was administered twice a day, between days 18 and 45 after induction. Clinical score, edema, and body weight were evaluated during the experimental period. After euthanasia, tibiotarsal joints were collected for assessment of disease histopathological score, and tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GA) muscles were weighed to assess muscle mass. Muscle atrophy was evaluated by measurement of TA myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA). Protein expression was evaluated by western blot using GA homogenates. Serum inflammatory markers were evaluated by ELISA. Statistical analysis included ANOVA followed by Tukey’s or with Kruskal-Wallis. The statistical difference was assumed for p &lt; 0.05. Results Tofacitinib treatment decreased arthritis severity by reducing clinical score, and hind paw edema in comparison with the vehicle group. Tofacitinib showed weight gain, higher TA and GA weights, and increased CSA compared to the vehicle group. On day 45, Tofacitinib presented increased muscle strength compared to the vehicle group, however, no difference was found in muscle fatigue. Pax7 expression was unchanged, while MyoD expression showed an increasing trend, and myogenin expression was significantly increased in Tofacitinib compared to vehicle and control groups. The treatment didn’t modify Murf-1 expression. Tofacitinib mice showed decreased serum levels of TNF and increased IL-6 serum levels. Conclusion Tofacitinib attenuated muscle loss in arthritic mice, increased muscle weight and muscle CSA. Activation of satellite cell regeneration, based on the increased expression of myogenin, is a potential mechanism involved in tofacitinib action against muscle loss.",

Objective We aim to evaluate the transcriptional levels of TGF- β 1 mRNA in PBMCs, assess the TGF- β 1 serum levels of SSc patients, and compare them with those of healthy subjects. Methods PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 50 SSc patients and in 30 healthy controls. After total RNA was extracted from isolated PBMCs, complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed. Afterward, the expression of TGF- β 1 mRNA was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR using the SYBR Green, GAPDH, and TGF- β 1 specific primers. The serum levels of TGF- β 1 were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit. Results There was a significant upregulation of TGF- β 1 relative expression ( p &lt; 0.0001), when SSc patients were compared to the control group. The diffuse subgroup was more common in patients with elevated TGF- β 1 mRNA expression ( p &lt; 0.0001). However, an insignificant difference was observed between the disease subsets of SSc. Serum TGF- β 1 levels were upregulated in SSc patients (78.35 ± 23.16) compared to healthy subjects (61.06 ± 15.90), and were considerably higher in SSc patients with ILD ( p &lt; 0.01) and positive anti-topo-Isomerase antibody ( p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion In patients with SSc, elevated levels of TGF- β 1 in serum and their correlation with clinical symptoms imply that this cytokine may serve as a marker for fibrotic and vascular involvement in SSc.",

Methods This was a cross-sectional, real-world study conducted in 17 Brazilian private health care institutes. Patients were selected if diagnosed with AS or axial radiographic spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) and treated with NSAIDs or TNFi for at least 12 weeks within the last 26 weeks prior to enrollment. The data were collected from interviewed-based and self-administered questionnaires from patients and physicians. Disease activity was defined as active (≥ 4), low /suboptimal (≥ 2 and &lt; 4) and inactive (&lt; 4) by Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and/or very high (≥ 3.5), high (≥ 2.1 to &lt; 3.5), low (≥ 1.3 to &lt; 2.1), and inactive (&lt; 1.3) by AS Disease Activity Score (ASDAS-CRP). Both patients and physicians’ perceptions of disease control were assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS; 0—inactive to 10—very active disease). Results The cohort included 378 patients with a mean age of 46 years, and the median time since diagnosis until enrollment was 5.4 years (interquartile range 2.7–10.5). Most patients were treated with TNFi alone (74%), followed by TNFi in combination with NSAID (15%), and NSAID alone (11%). About half AS patients showed active disease and 24% of patients showed low activity/suboptimal disease control despite having been treated for at least 12 weeks. Although TNFi showed better disease control than NSAID, inactive disease was experienced by few patients. The NRS (mean [standard deviation]) score for disease perception was 4.24 (3.3) and 2.85 (2.6) for patients and physicians, respectively. Conclusion This real-world study showed that most AS patients on TNFi and/or NSAID had not achieved an adequate disease control, as almost 75% of them exhibited active disease or low activity/suboptimal disease control. There remains a need for improved disease management among patients with AS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with rheumatologic diseases are monitored fundamentally through metric tools or index calculated from clinical data and patient exams, which allow us to assess the severity of the disease and guide the therapeutic decision. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for treatment to be optimized and considered effective, periodic assessment with composite disease activity index and a 'treat-to-target' approach is required. The Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) in the Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) includes only three measures based on the central patient self-reported dataset and can be used in a 'treat-to-target' approach analogous to the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Disease Activity Score 28-joints (DAS28). This tool, however, has not undergone cross-cultural or clinical validation in Brazil. In this research, we performed the MDHAQ cross-cultural and clinical validation for the Brazilian population of RA patients. Methods The Portuguese version of the MDHAQ was created identically in an electronic questionnaire and underwent a cross-cultural validation process with 38 participants. Test–retest was performed in 29 patients. Further, a clinical validation with 129 Rheumatoid Arthritis patients was performed. Electronic MDHAQ was answered through an online platform. We also collected socioeconomic data as well as other clinical (CDAI, SDAI, DAS28) and functional (HAQ) scores during the face-to-face assessment of patients. Results MDHAQ/RAPID3 maintained semantic, idiomatic, as well as conceptual and experience equivalence for the Brazilian population, with 92% acceptance of participants. It showed test–retest reliability, adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.85) and correlation of the scores obtained with adequate association with the DAS28 gold standard. RAPID3 also had high sensitivity (98%), adequate specificity (48%), high negative predictive value (92%) and negative post-test probability of 8%, attributes expected for a test tool for population screening. Conclusion The use of MDHAQ/RAPID3 associated with traditional clinical measures can adequately allow for remote follow-up based on the 'treat-to-target' approach with performance comparable to the gold standard DAS28, being a viable tool in the sample of Brazilian patients with RA in the current context of telehealth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Statins have long been extensively prescribed as effective lipid-lowering agents, but statins have also been recognized as novel immunomodulators in recent years. This study was designed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of atorvastatin on lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice. Methods A total of 30 8-week-old female MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into three groups and orally administered vehicle, atorvastatin orhydroxychloroquine sulfate for 11 weeks. In vivo, the effects of atorvastatin on the survival rate, renal function and spleen index in MRL/lpr mice were examined. Ex vivo, splenic B-cell proliferation was assessed by a Cell Counting Kit-8. Results Oral atorvastatin failed to prolong survival time, or reduce the levels of proteinuria, or serum anti-dsDNA antibody and complement proteins (C3, C4). Histologically, no significant improvement by atorvastatin was observed in the pathological manifestations of renal damage, while hydroxychloroquine sulfate significantly improved glomerular injury. Ex vivo, atorvastatin suppressed the proliferation of splenic B lymphocytes. Conclusion Oral atorvastatin monotherapy had no therapeutic effects on MRL/lpr mice, whereas atorvastatin inhibited splenic B-cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting that atorvastatin has a potential therapeutic effect on systemic lupus erythematosus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To investigate the role of eye signs in predicting poor outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Methods This prospective observational study recruited patients diagnosed with SLE-PAH from Jan. 2021 to Dec. 2021 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University; those with other potential causes of PAH were excluded. The evaluation of various parameters, such as N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC), echocardiography, and risk stratification based on the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines, was conducted at intervals of every 1–3 months, and a 6-month follow-up period was observed. The primary outcome measure considered improvement if there was a decline in the risk stratification grade at the end point and unimproved if there was no decline. Conjunctival microvascular images were observed and recorded. Results A total of 29 SLE-PAH patients were enrolled, comprising 12 in the improved group and 17 in the nonimproved group. All SLE-PAH patients showed various manifestations of eye signs, including vessel twisting, dilation, ischaemic areas, haemorrhages, reticulum deformity, and wound spots. The nonimproved group exhibited significantly lower vessel density (VD) and microvascular flow index (MFI) of conjunctival microvascular images than the improved group. Correlation analysis revealed that VD displayed a negative correlation with the WHO-FC ( r = −0.413, p = 0.026) and NT-proBNP ( r = −0.472, p = 0.010), as well as a positive correlation with the 6MWD ( r = 0.561, p = 0.002). Similarly, MFI exhibited a negative correlation with WHO-FC ( r = −0.408, p = 0.028) and NT-proBNP ( r = −0.472, p = 0.010) and a positive correlation with 6MWD ( r = 0.157, p = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that VD (OR 10.11, 95% CI 1.95–52.36), MFI (OR 7.85, 95% CI 1.73–35.67), NT-proBNP, and 6MWD were influential factors in predicting the prognostic improvement of SLE-PAH patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that VD, MFI, 6MWD, and NT-proBNP (with respective AUC values of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.90, respectively) possessed a sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 100%, as well as 83 and 100%, respectively. Regarding prognostic prediction, VD and MFI exhibited higher sensitivity than 6MWD, whereas MFI displayed higher sensitivity and specificity than NT-proBNP. Conclusion SLE-PAH can lead to various conjunctival microvascular manifestations in which vascular density and microvascular flow index can be used to assess cardiopulmonary function and predict therapeutic efficacy and prognosis in SLE-PAH patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Spondyloarthritis (SpA) encompasses a spectrum of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions primarily affecting the axial skeleton, including sacroiliitis and spondylitis, each with distinct features. This study aimed to investigate imaging disparities, focusing on sacroiliac magnetic resonance and spine radiography, across phenotypes and between males and females in axial SpA. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess clinical data, laboratory findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores of sacroiliac joints using the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) and Sacroiliac Joint Structural Score (SSS), and cervical and lumbar spine radiographs utilizing the Modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS). The study aimed to compare these parameters between two groups: axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA, radiographic and non-radiographic) and axial psoriatic arthritis (axPsA), as well as between males and females. Results Ninety-four patients were included, with 62 patients in the axSpA group and 32 patients in the axPsA group. There were no differences in disease activity, mobility, radiographic damage in the spine (Modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score– mSASSS), or sacroiliac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores (Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Magnetic Resonance Imaging Index - SPARCC and Sacroiliac Joint Structural Score - SSS) between the two phenotypes. Regarding sex, in imaging exams, men had higher mSASSS ( p = 0.008), SSS ( p = 0.001), and fat metaplasia (MG) score based on SSS ( p = 0.001), while women had significantly higher SPARCC scores ( p = 0.039). In the male group, the presence of HLA-B27 allele had an impact on more structural lesions on MRI (SSS), p = 0.013. Conclusion In this study, imaging of sacroiliac joints and spine in patients with axial SpA did not show differences in phenotypes but did reveal differences based on sex, which may have an impact on future diagnostic recommendations. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

Infectious ( Chlamydia trachomatis ) or non-infectious (uric acid) prostatitis can hypothetically trigger vertebral inflammation in AS. This study aimed to assess the features of chronic prostatitis in patients with AS compared to healthy controls. Methods A cross-sectional study including male patients with AS and healthy controls who agreed to undergo a prostate examination was conducted. Structured clinical interviews, prostate physical examinations, and cytological, biochemical, and microbiological tests on urinary samples collected before and after standardized prostatic massage (pre- and post-massage test) were performed. Results Ninety participants (45 AS patients, mean age: 52.5 ± 10.0 years, with longstanding disease, 12.4 ± 6.9 years, and 45 controls, mean age: 52.8 ± 12.1 years) were included. National Institutes of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) scores were similar in the AS and control groups (4.0 [1.0–12.0] vs. 5.0 [1.0–8.5], p = 0.994). The frequencies of symptoms of chronic prostatitis (NIH-CPSI Pain Domain ≥4) were also similar in both groups (23.3% vs. 22.7%, p = 0.953). Results of polymerase chain reaction tests for Chlamydia trachomatis were negative in all tested urinary samples, and uric acid concentrations and leukocyte counts were similar in all pre- and post-massage urinary samples. Conclusions In this study, chronic prostatitis occurred in male patients with AS, but its frequency and characteristics did not differ from those found in the healthy male population of similar age.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and pattern of post-acute COVID-19 in vaccinated patients with ARD using established diagnosis criteria.Retrospective evaluation of a prospective cohort of 108 ARD patients and 32 non-ARD controls, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR/antigen test) after the third dose of the CoronaVac vaccine. Post-acute COVID-19 (≥ 4 weeks and > 12 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms) were registered according to the established international criteria.ARD patients and non-ARD controls, balanced for age and sex, had high and comparable frequencies of ≥ 4 weeks post-acute COVID-19 (58.3% vs. 53.1%, p = 0.6854) and > 12 weeks post-acute COVID-19 (39.8% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.5419). Regarding ≥ 4 weeks post-acute COVID-19, frequencies of ≥ 3 symptoms were similar in ARD and non-ARD controls (54% vs. 41.2%, p = 0.7886), and this was also similar in > 12 weeks post-acute COVID-19 (68.3% vs. 88.2%, p = 0.1322). Further analysis of the risk factors for ≥ 4 weeks post-acute COVID-19 in ARD patients revealed that age, sex, clinical severity of COVID-19, reinfection, and autoimmune diseases were not associated with this condition (p > 0.05). The clinical manifestations of post-acute COVID-19 were similar in both groups (p > 0.05), with fatigue and memory loss being the most frequent manifestations.We provide novel data demonstrating that immune/inflammatory ARD disturbances after third dose vaccination do not seem to be a major determinant of post-acute COVID-19 since its pattern is very similar to that of the general population.

Female patients were predominant (54.38%). The incidence of visits due to PsA has been increasing in recent years and we observed an incidence of 8,982 new visits in 2020. The main comorbidities of these patients were osteoarthritis, lower back pain, shoulder injuries, oncological diseases, crystal arthropathies, and osteoporosis. Hospitalizations were mainly due to treating clinical or cardiovascular conditions and performing orthopedic procedures.The number of visits due to PsA in SUS has increased in recent years, mainly on account of new diagnoses of the disease, although the prevalence found in this study's population was lower than that observed in the general population.",

Imaging exams are useful for muscle assessment, with ultrasonography (US) being a promising tool in detecting disease activity and tissue damage. There are few studies about muscle elastography. Objectives Our aim was to associate clinical, laboratory, and nailfold capillaroscopy (NC) assessments with US in JDM patients; and to compare the findings of US and Strain Elastography (SE) from patients and healthy controls. Methods An analytic cross-sectional study was performed with JDM patients and healthy controls. Patients underwent clinical exam to access muscle strength and completed questionnaires about global assessment of the disease and functional capacity. Patients were submitted to NC and measurement of muscle enzymes. All subjects underwent US assessment, using gray scale, Power Doppler (PD), and SE. Results Twenty-two JDM patients and fourteen controls, aged between 5 and 21 years, matched for age and sex were assessed. In qualitative and semi-quantitative gray scale, we observed a higher frequency of alterations in patients (p &lt; 0.001), while in PD, there was a higher frequency of positivity in patients’ deltoids and anterior tibialis (p &lt; 0.001). Active disease was associated with an important change in the semi-quantitative gray scale in deltoids (p = 0.007), biceps brachii (p = 0.001) and quadriceps femoris (p = 0.005). The SE demonstrated a high negative predictive value of 87.2. Conclusion US was able, through gray scale, to differentiate JDM patients from controls, while PD achieved such differentiation only for deltoids and anterior tibialis. The semi-quantitative gray scale showed disease activity in proximal muscles. SE was not able to differentiate patients from controls.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activation and joint destruction. Fasciola hepatica is a platyhelminth that releases excretory-secretory immunomodulatory products capable of suppressing the Th1 immune response. Despite the effectiveness of available treatments for inducing disease remission, current options are not successful in all patients and may cause side effects. Thus, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of F. hepatica extract on FLS from RA patients and arthritis models. Methods FLS were isolated from synovial fluid of RA patients, cultured, and exposed to F. hepatica extract (60, 80, and 100 µg/ml) for different time points to assess cell viability, adherence, migration and invasion. For in vivo experiments, mice with antigen (AIA) and collagen (CIA) induced arthritis received a 200 µg/dose of F. hepatica extract daily. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Student's t-test using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Results In vitro assays showed that extract decreased FLS cell viability at concentration of 100 µg/ml (83.8% ± 5.0 extract vs. 100.0% ± 0.0 control; p &lt; 0.05), adherence in 20% (92.0 cells ± 5.8 extract vs. 116.3 cells ± 7.9 control; p &lt; 0.05), migratory potential (69.5% ± 17.6 extract vs. 100.0% control; p &lt; 0.05), and cell invasiveness potential through the matrigel (76.0% ± 8.4 extract vs. 100.0% control; p &lt; 0.01). The extract reduced leukocyte migration by 56% (40 × 10 4 leukocytes/knee ± 19.00) compared to control (90.90 × 10 4 leukocytes/knee ± 12.90) ( p &lt; 0.01) and nociception (6.37 g ± 0.99 extract vs. 3.81 g ± 1.44 control; p &lt; 0.001) in AIA and delayed clinical onset of CIA (11.75 ± 2.96 extract vs. 14.00 ± 2.56 control; p = 0.126). Conclusion Our results point out a potential immunomodulatory effect of F. hepatica extract in RA models. Therefore, the characterization of promising new immunomodulatory molecules should be pursued, as they can promote the development of new therapies.
