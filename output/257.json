    "abstract": "The efficient extraction of force constants (FCs) is crucial for the analysis of many thermodynamic materials properties. Approaches based on the systematic enumeration of finite differences scale poorly with system size and can rarely extend beyond third order when input data is obtained from first-principles calculations. Methods based on parameter fitting in the spirit of interatomic potentials, on the other hand, can extract FC parameters from semi-random configurations of high information density and advanced regularized regression methods can recover physical solutions from a limited amount of data. Here, we present the hiPhive Python package, that enables the construction of force constant models up to arbitrary order. hiPhive exploits crystal symmetries to reduce the number of free parameters and then employs advanced machine learning algorithms to extract the force constants. Depending on the problem at hand both over and underdetermined systems are handled efficiently. The FCs can be subsequently analyzed directly and or be used to carry out e.g., molecular dynamics simulations. The utility of this approach is demonstrated via several examples including ideal and defective monolayers of MoS$_2$ as well as bulk nickel.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Luminescence (nano)thermometry is an increasingly important field for remote temperature sensing with high spatial resolution. Most typically, ratiometric sensing of the luminescence emission intensities of two thermally coupled emissive states based on a Boltzmann equilibrium is used to detect the local temperature. Dependent on the temperature range and preferred spectral window, various choices for potential candidates appear possible. Despite extensive experimental research in the field, a universal theory covering the basics of luminescence thermometry is virtually nonexistent. In this manuscript, a general theoretical framework of single ion luminescent thermometers is presented that offers simple, user‐friendly guidelines for both the choice of an appropriate emitter and respective embedding host material for optimum temperature sensing. The results show that the optimum performance (thermal response and sensitivity) around T 0 is realized for an energy gap ∆ E 21 between thermally coupled levels between 2 k B T 0 and 3.41 k B T 0 . Analysis of the temperature‐dependent excited state kinetics shows that host lattices in which ∆ E 21 can be bridged by one or two phonons are preferred over hosts in which higher order phonon processes are required. Such a framework is relevant for both a fundamental understanding of luminescent thermometers but also the targeted design of novel and superior luminescent (nano)thermometers.",

The properties of these materials rely highly on the constitutive materials and their spatial distributions and the resulting materials may exhibit various special properties, for example, photonic/phononic band gaps, negative permittivity/permeability, negative effective modulus, and negative refraction. Therefore, PtCs, PnCs, and MMs can be viewed as structural materials with periodic unit cells, the design of which is a typical topology optimization problem for desired properties or functionalities. In recent years, a great amount of research has implemented topology optimization for designing these structural materials as well as the associated functional devices.

Here, we describe how small molecules can be accurately parametrized within the Martini 3 framework and present a database of validated small molecule models. We pay particular attention to the description of aliphatic and aromatic ring-like structures, which are ubiquitous in small molecules such as solvents and drugs or in building blocks constituting macromolecules such as proteins and synthetic polymers. In Martini 3, ring-like structures are described by models that use higher resolution coarse-grained particles (small and tiny particles). As such, the present database constitutes one of the cornerstones of the calibration of the new Martini 3 small and tiny particle sizes. The models show excellent partitioning behavior and solvent properties. Miscibility trends between different bulk phases are also captured, completing the set of thermodynamic properties considered during the parametrization. We also show how the new bead sizes allow for a good representation of molecular volume, which translates into better structural properties such as stacking distances. We further present design strategies to build Martini 3 models for small molecules of increased complexity.",

The device outputs estimated theoretically in this study are almost equal to the experimental results, thereby verifying accuracy of this simulation. To find the decent electron transport layer (ETL), herein, various ETLs are presented instead of C 60 /BCP in the experimental FASnI 3 ‐based perovskite solar cell (PSC). The designed FASnI 3 PSC utilizing niobium pentoxide (Nb 2 O 5 ) as an ETL with an appropriate band alignment and a low lattice mismatch at FASnI 3 /ETL interface provides better efficiency by decreasing recombination at front side. The performances of the proposed PSC are also measured by altering the thickness and doping of ETL and absorber, interface defects, and series and shunt resistances. Furthermore, this paper reports the calculation of recombination coefficients at absorber/ETL interface, depletion region, and quasi‐neutral region. An improved efficiency of 22.24% is evaluated at optimized thicknesses of 100 nm for HTL, 500 nm for absorber, 50 nm for ETL, and 50 nm for ITO for the proposed inverted PSC of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FASnI 3 /Nb 2 O 5 /Ag. These results suggest that chemically stable and less‐toxic Nb 2 O 5 can be applied as a useful ETL in inverted PSCs for further improving the performances.",

In this study, structural and electronic properties of the HTS are examined thoroughly. GeH/InSe and GeH/In 2 Se 3 are determined as n‐type Schottky with a Schottky barrier height (SBH) of 0.40 eV and n ‐type ohmic, respectively. GeH/InSe turns out as a semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 0.62 eV, while GeH/In 2 Se 3 is seen to be a metal. The results show that changing of the bandgap and SBH in very small values. For GeH/In 2 Se 3 the effects are even less substantial, as the metallic or n ‐type nature of the material does not change. The biaxial strain and electric field have more tangible effects on the characteristics of the HTS. A mixture of compressive and tensile strain is seen to have the capability of changing GeH/InSe into a metal and at the same time transform it to an n ‐type/ p ‐type ohmic or p ‐type Schottky contact.

This study provides insights into flow control, energy efficiency, enhanced heat transfer, and turbulence management, all of which have significant industrial applications. The SpaceClaim‐generated duct designs have 40 mm major inlet diameters and 10 mm minor inlets on either side, with an output diverging to 10 mm. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) k‐ model in ANSYS Fluent 2024R2 is used for better management of pressure gradients and precise prediction of boundary layer behavior. Meshing and simulation followed a strict methodology, assuring precision and dependability. It is worth noting that increasing the number of sinusoidal half‐cycles increases turbulence, which raises the Reynolds number and enhances the cooling effect. Longer wavy ducts are shown to increase flow acceleration, resulting in greater output velocities and more turbulent kinetic energy production. Turbulent viscosity in a 2.5‐period sinusoidal wavy duct rises dramatically with inflow velocity and temperature. A 12.5‐period sinusoidal wavy duct is substantially more turbulent viscosity than a 2.5‐period duct. These findings have important implications for applications that require improved heat dissipation and flow control, including heat exchanger design and thermal management systems.",

Direct substitution of Pb with a non‐toxic cation usually lowers the structural or electronic dimension, thereby impacting the excellent photovoltaic properties of halide perovskites. In this work, Pb‐free halide perovskites by incorporating the anionic or neutral molecules on the A‐site of the perovskite lattice and assess the photovoltaic potential by first‐principles calculations is constructed. The Pb‐free perovskite CH 4 BiCl 3 is predicted to have a direct bandgap within the optimal range for photovoltaic application.

The excellent photovoltaic performance is demonstrated by calculating the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency, which shows an efficiency of 30.9% for a typical thickness of 0.5 µm. The structural stability of cubic perovskite CH 4 BiCl 3 is further evaluated by computing the decomposition energy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, demonstrating the thermodynamic stability of CH 4 BiCl 3 at room temperature.

A deep‐learning neural network to predict the vast and complex system is proposed, in which only 70 000 training coding patterns are used to train the network.

In this work, the authors conduct a systematic and comprehensive computational study of the quasi‐static and dynamic energy absorption properties of various different geometries.

The authors analyze geometries with varying degrees of nodal connectivity, ranging from bending dominated to stretching dominated, at different orientations, and compare their response to equivalent stochastic lattices. Results show relatively high stress peaks in the periodic lattices, even in bending dominated lattices at certain orientations. Conversely, the stochastic geometries show a relatively constant stress response over large strains, which is ideal for energy absorbing applications. Still, results show that specific orientations of bending dominated periodic lattice geometries outperform their stochastic equivalents.

    "abstract": "Abstract Stabilizing single‐atom metal catalysts with carbon materials and utilizing their synergistic effect remains challenging due to weak interactions between carbon‐based supports and metals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a single Ru atom was supported on a wide range of natural nanoporous carbon materials, including C 2 N, triazine‐C 3 N 4 (T‐C 3 N 4 ), and γ‐graphene. These carbon materials belong to a new generation of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the N 2 reduction reaction (NRR) and are named Ru 1 @C 2 N, Ru 1 @T‐C 3 N 4 , and Ru 1 @γ‐graphyne, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations show that a single Ru atom can be stably anchored in the nanopores of these carbon materials with strong cohesive energy. Compared with parallel adsorption configuration, the vertical adsorption configuration of N 2 exhibits higher adsorption energy. The calculated Gibbs free energy reveals N 2 reduction on the three catalysts via associative mechanisms. Despite the similar limiting potentials (−0.96, −0.94, and −0.98 V on Ru 1 @C 2 N, Ru 1 @T‐C 3 N 4 , and Ru 1 @γ‐graphynes, respectively), the limiting step differs, indicating the significant effects of carbon material substrates on electrochemical NRR. However, the competitive and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) changes the potential determining step and increases the overpotential for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR). This study provides insights for experimental synthesis of electrocatalysts for N 2 reduction.",

The current feature selection algorithms usually require tedious hyperparameter tuning and do not actively consider the prior knowledge of domain experts about the features. Here, this work proposes a data‐driven multi‐layer feature selection method incorporating domain expert knowledge named DML‐FS dek , which is automated, with users entering training data without manual tuning of the hyperparameters. The domain expert knowledge is quantified by means of weighted scoring and integrated into the selection process to eliminate the risk of crucial features being removed. The test studies on ten material properties datasets demonstrate the potential of the approach to automatically search for a reduced feature set with lower root mean square errors than those for the initial feature set. Essentially, the most relevant material features, the number of which is much smaller than that in the original feature set, are automatically selected to establish a closer and more accurate structure–activity relationship for the materials of interest. As a result, the method represents the targeted properties of materials with a smaller and more interpretable set of features while ensuring equal or better prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High‐entropy carbides (HECs) are of great interest as they are promising candidates for ultra‐high‐temperature and high‐hardness applications. To discover carbides with enhanced yield strength and hardness, mechanism‐based design approaches are needed. In this study, dislocation core atomic randomness as a mechanism for hardness enhancement is proposed, in which the random interactions between different elements at a dislocation core make it more difficult for the dislocation to slip. The Peierls stress of an edge dislocation is calculated based on density functional theory, in which atomic randomness is increased by increasing the number of elements at the dislocation core. The results show that the Peierls stress statistically increases with increasing number of elements, indicating that incorporating more elements is likely to produce higher hardness. Based on this guiding principle, three eight‐cation HECs are fabricated (Ti,Zr,Hf,V,Nb,Ta,X,Y)C (X,Y = Mo,W, Cr,Mo, or Cr,W), the composition of which is guided by ab initio calculations of their formation enthalpy and entropy forming ability. The single‐phase dense ceramics all show high nanoindentation hardness of around 40 GPa. The random interactions between different elements at a dislocation core provide a mechanism for improving the hardness of structural ceramics.",

The combination of length‐gauge and velocity‐gauge electromagnetic field has extended the diversity of materials under consideration, ranging from low dimensional systems to periodic solids. Meanwhile, by employing a local basis presentation, systems of a large size are simulated for long electronic propagation time, with moderate computational cost while maintaining a relatively high accuracy.

Furthermore, coalescence can affect properties of larger structures that consist of nanoparticles as their elementary building blocks, such as the fractal dimension of cluster aggregates and the porosity and conductance of thin films. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that a great body of research, both experimental and theoretical, has focused on nanoparticle coalescence over the course of the past few decades. This review attempts to summarize the most important recent results from computational studies on nanoparticle coalescence and draw parallels between theoretical and experimental findings. The approach used here aspires to explain nanoparticle coalescence within the framework of a single intuitive narrative by integrating previous results obtained using various methods by the authors and others. Simultaneously, it is discussed where understanding and controlling (i.e., enhancing or inhibiting) nanoparticle coalescence can have great technological interest.",

The traditional target detection methods have the problems of insufficient detection capability, long model inference time and low recognition accuracy for small targets and long strip defects in WTB datasets. This paper proposes a high‐precision model SOD‐YOLO for WTB surface defect detection based on UAVs image analysis of YOLOv5. First, the WTB images are preprocessed by foreground segmentation and Hough transform to build the WTB defect dataset. Then, a micro‐scale detection layer is added to the original YOLOv5, and the K‐means algorithm is used to re‐cluster anchors and add the CBAM attention mechanism to each feature fusion layer to reduce the loss of feature information for small target defects and other defects. In addition, to improve the detection efficiency, the channel pruning algorithm is used to reduce the model size. The experimental results show that the average accuracy (mAP) of the SOD‐YOLO algorithm on the WTB dataset reaches 95.1%, which is 7.82% better than YOLOv5, and the FPS is 28.3% better. Therefore, SOD‐YOLO is able to detect small target defects and other defects quickly and effectively.",

To realize polarization controlling, many microstructures have been designed to achieve the function. However, multi‐band linear to dual‐circular polarization converter is rarely proposed and designed in the last few years. Here, a quad‐band dual‐circular transmissive metasurface (QCT‐MS) is proposed to manipulate polarization of transmissive wave. QCT‐MS is designed as a three‐layer microstructure, with substrate in the middle and two metal patches in the shape of bi‐symmetrical arrow on both sides. The proposed microstructure manipulates linear polarization waves to dual‐circular polarization waves in different frequency bands with x ‐polarized or y ‐polarized incident waves. The experimental and simulated results reveal that left‐hand circularly polarized waves can be realized in 3.14–3.32, 4.41–4.46, and 14.82–16.05 GHz while the right‐hand circularly polarized waves can be achieved from 9.45 to 10.12 GHz for QCT‐MS with x ‐polarized incidences. Moreover, the simulated results also demonstrate its characteristics of wide‐angle transmission and periodic changes. The proposed transmissive metasurface can be utilized in multiband communication and multifunctional dual‐circularly polarized antenna systems.",

Simulation results indicate that the absorbance of 99.8% at 0.221 THz can be achieved when the designed PA is under the room temperature of T = 300 K, which is in good agreement with the calculation done by the coupling mode theory (CMT). The simulated distributions of electric and magnetic fields in the unit‐cell structure of the designed PA reveal that the observed perfect absorption is mainly attributed to the Mie resonance of the all‐dielectric MCS structure STO. In addition, this designed PA is polarization‐insensitive and wide‐angle absorption for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves. The resonance absorption properties of the designed PA can be controlled by changing the geometrical parameters of STO resonator structure. The designed PA can be served as a temperature sensor, which has a sensitivity of about 0.37 GHz K −1 since the electrical property of the STO is dependent on the variation of surrounding temperature. Furthermore, the perfect absorption can also be achieved by the PAs using the square, circular, and ring STO structures. The proposed design concepts of the STO‐based tunable PAs can find potential THz applications in sensing, detecting, imaging, and so on.",

In this work, the role played by the functional in predicting the activity of single atom catalysts (SAC) in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is studied. 16 transition metal (TM) atoms embedded in N‐doped graphene are simulated and the performance of the widely adopted Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional against the hybrid PBE0 functional is assessed. The PBE+ U approach, a computationally less complex way to correct for the self‐interaction error in density functional theory, is also considered. The predictions obtained with PBE have a substantial deviation from PBE0 for first row TMs, i.e., 3d systems, while smaller deviations are found for the 4d and 5d series. The PBE+ U results represent an improvement with respect to PBE, although some differences from PBE0 remain. This study underlines the importance of the choice of the DFT functional in screening new catalysts and in predicting catalytic activities. The use of PBE appears acceptable for 4d and 5d metals, while in the case of 3d systems PBE+ U or PBE0 approaches are recommended, in particular for magnetic ground states.",

The as‐synthesized MXenes exhibit a variety of surface terminations involving mixtures of O, OH, H, or F surface groups. These terminations play a crucial role in the electrocatalytic performance of these materials as these may change depending on the reaction conditions. The Pourbaix diagrams have long being used to provide the thermodynamically stable surface under certain conditions of pH and potential, U . However, experimental determination of Pourbaix diagrams may be quite challenging while first‐principles studies, considering the most likely terminations, allow deriving reliable insights. Here, Pourbaix diagrams for a series of representative MXenes are provided; the Ti 2 C, Ti 3 C 2 , V 2 C, and Mo 2 C MXenes, with the novelty of considering single and several double mixed terminations.

    "abstract": "Abstract The choice of appropriate materials is of paramount importance in realizing a high efficiency perovskite solar cell. Lead free eco‐friendly perovskite solar cell architecture is theoretically investigated using solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) for device performance. Preliminary investigations on Cs 2 SnI 6 solar cell architectures have indicated that the presence of hole transport layer is crucial in achieving an open‐circuit voltage greater than 0.6 V. The presence of a valence band offset between the Cs 2 SnI 6 absorber and hole transport layer has a significant detrimental impact on the short‐circuit current density and fill factor of the cell. A novel device architecture employing TiO 2 as an electron transport material and Cu 2 O as a hole transport material is proposed to overcome the limitations associated with the current designs. Theoretical investigations are carried out employing 1D SCAPS simulation program in order to optimize the structure by varying the perovskite thickness, bandgap, and defect concentration. The proposed solar cell after optimization has a practically realizable power conversion efficiency of 17.77%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A fast response of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) to electrical or chemical changes is essential for a widespread acceptance of this technology. However, finding design rules for fast switching OECTs is complicated by the fact that current transient device models are highly simplified and rely on a 1D approximation of the device that neglects details of the ion and hole concentration inside the transistor channel. To improve the understanding of transient processes limiting the speed of OECTs, a 2D drift‐diffusion model is presented and experimentally validated. It is shown that switching is strongly influenced by lateral ion currents that are neglected in previous models. A consistent treatment of these currents leads to a dependency of the time constants on the applied drain potential and a complex dependency of the response time constants on the detailed device geometry. In addition to an improved understanding of the transient response of OECTs, the results discussed here highlight the challenges in properly characterizing switching time constants of OECTs, and reinforce the necessity to ensure that switching is measured between two steady‐state conditions, and not between transient states.",

Meanwhile, the unique properties of the interaction between light and matter have been carved out into the development of modern‐day diagnostic biosensors.

With the advantages of real‐time and label‐free bio‐sensing, plasmonic sensors are being utilized in multiple diverse areas of food technology, the bio‐medical diagnostic sector, and even the chemical industry. Although this review will be brief, readers can gain a comprehensive picture of the essential elements by taking a broader look into the exploration of SPR sensor design via simulated studies and representative experimental plasmonic schemes developed for bio‐sensing. In short, the various SPR sensing schemes that researchers have explored to realize enhanced SPR sensitivity are reviewed and summarized. Different experimental plasmonic sensors are also examined in which new SPR excitation schemes have been adopted. These \"unconventional\" designs, specifically those involving hybrid localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)‐SPR excitation, may inspire those in the plasmonic field.",

Based on the concepts of digital metasurface and propagation phase, a broadband 3‐bit coding transmission metasurface is designed and illustrated by simulation and measurement. The elements exhibit the different phase by changing the size of metal patch, and the focusing phase is introduced to reduce the divergence of OAM beams. Based on the principle of phase superposition, the wide‐band, high‐purity, and multi‐beam OAM vortex waves can be generated by the transmission‐coding metasurface (TCMS). The experimental results verify that TCMS realizes the multiple OAM beams along different directions simultaneously from 9 to 10.5 GHz, which are consistent with the theoretical results. The high purity more than 90% of OAM mode is demonstrated by both the simulated and measured results.

In the controller design, these uncertainties caused by modeling errors will be accumulated to the last step for compensation. Unknown parameters existing in the upper bound functions of unknown nonlinear functions and system parameters are estimated synchronously based on tuning function approaches. It is shown that the designed output feedback controller can ensure the stability and tracking performance of the closed‐loop system, and the transient performance in terms of a truncated norm is also established.",

The solar cell capacitance simulator in one dimension (SCAPS‐1D) is used to investigate the photovoltaic (PV) performances of the heterojunction Al/FTO/WS 2 /FASnI 3 /Zn 3 P 2 /Ni solar structure. The performance metrics of proposed device with numerous ETLs and HTLs are discussed. The suggested device provides appropriate band structures, which in turn potentially reduce minority electron recombination, thereby enhancing overall performances. Influences of various physical parameters such as thickness, doping concentration, bulk defect, interface defect states, work function, and back surface recombination velocity (BSRV) on the device performances have also been analyzed. An efficiency of 29.81% is achieved at the optimum thicknesses of 0.05 µm for WS 2 ETL, 1.0 µm for FASnI 3 absorber, and 0.1 µm for Zn 3 P 2 HTL. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm is used to assess the impact of multiple semiconductor parameters, and found that defect density influences the most. This model, which has an approximate correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.937, can predict the data with precision. Therefore, these numerical outcomes will help researchers further design and manufacture a low‐cost and highly efficient FASnI 3 ‐based PSC.",

This research is driven by identifying perovskite materials with a tunable bandgap that are both efficient and non‐toxic for solar cell applications. The materials under consideration are found to be mechanically and thermodynamically stable, as per the Born stability criteria and formation energy calculations. This band structure analysis indicates these compounds exhibit semiconducting behavior with a tunable bandgap. Under ambient conditions, the Ge─X and Na─X bonds display covalent and ionic characteristics, respectively. Substituting halogens from F to I increases lattice parameters and a more covalent nature of the Ge─X bond. Concurrently, the bandgap narrows, transitioning from indirect (F) to direct (Cl, Br, and I). At the same time, the static dielectric constant rises, and both absorption and conductivity are significantly enhanced with a redshift in the optical spectrum. The application of tensile stress (positive pressure) increases both the lattice constant and bandgap, whereas the dielectric constant, absorption, conductivity, and reflectivity decrease. Conversely, compressive stress (negative pressure) induces the opposite effect. Pressure‐induced variations in the bandgap highlight the potential of NaGeX 3 materials to significantly impact the next‐generation solar cells’ development, offering a pathway to more sustainable and efficient energy solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study numerically investigates the effects of a magnetic field on mixed convection flow and entropy generation within a double lid‐driven square cavity filled with a hybrid nanofluid. The flow is induced by two isothermally heated semi‐circles located on the bottom and left walls of the cavity. The cavity is filled with a ternary composition of hybrid nanofluid (aluminum oxide/silver/copper oxide‐water) and is exposed to a uniform magnetic field. The velocity ratio of the moving lids and the radius ratio of the semi‐circles are key parameters in the analysis. The study employs the finite volume method and full multigrid acceleration to solve the coupled continuity, momentum, energy, and entropy generation equations, along with the relevant boundary conditions. Key dimensionless parameters considered include the Hartmann number (0 ≤ Ha ≤ 100), Richardson number (0.01 ≤ Ri ≤ 1), hybrid nanofluid volume fraction (3% ≤ ϕ ≤ 12%), internal semi‐circle radius ratio ( β = 0.5 and 1), and velocity ratio (−2 ≤ λ ≤ 2). Results revealed that the optimal heat transfer is achieved for Ri = 0.04, Ha = 100, ϕ = 0%, β = 1, and λ = 0.5 with 63% enhancement. Moreover, the maximum entropy generation rates are obtained for the same parameters with a rate of 47%, reflecting the complex balance of enhanced heat transfer and associated irreversibility's. Results reveal also that heat transfer and entropy generation are a decreasing function of Hartmann number implying a suppress of fluid motion due to the Lorentz force. This study provides a valuable resource and parametric analysis for researchers and engineers, aiding in the design and optimization of thermal management systems for various industrial applications, including heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, and energy systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biological studies have shown that macrophages play a dual role in cancer dynamics. Through the secretion of different factors, they can modulate the tumor microenvironment and directly interact with tumor cells. Active macrophages, more precisely tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM), can secrete substances that increase the proliferation and survival of tumor cells, thus promoting tumor growth. This study explores the dynamic interactions between tumor carcinogenesis and macrophage activation through a newly developed mathematical model using the Caputo sense fractional operator. The main focus is to analyze the influence of macrophage polarization on tumor progression and cancer development. To precisely capture the dynamic behavior of macrophage‐tumor interactions, the model is verified for qualitative analysis. The fixed points of the model are obtained and their stability analysis is carried out. It is started by explaining the essential components of the model and then assuring its mathematical reliability. The Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method (ABM) is also discussed to show its applicability and efficiency for the numerical results of the developed model. The findings shed light on cancer progress, potential analyses, and the influence of public information. The outcome of the study offers a more detailed understanding of possible treatment targets by highlighting the delicate balance between macrophage pro‐ and anti‐tumor effects. The outcomes might improve public health policy, healthcare budget apportionment, and contest tumors and related infections. Further, it improves the understanding of tumor‐immune system interactions and lays the solid basis for cancer treatment research. Finally, numerical simulations make our outcomes more significant.",

Additionally, the impact of temperature on the device performance is thoroughly investigated. The extensive optimization process involves the use of SCAPS, which allows for fine‐tuning of key parameters such as the acceptor density, donor density, trap density, thicknesses of the absorber, ETL, and HTL, also series and shunt resistances and density functional theory calculations implemented to conduct investigation of the optical properties of the inorganic perovskite derivative Cs₂TeI₆. By optimizing these parameters, Cs₂TeI₆ as the absorber, WS₂ as the ETL, and copper barium tin sulfide as the HTL are identified. This optimized configuration demonstrates remarkable performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency of 26.57%, a fill factor of 91.10%, a short‐circuit current density ( J SC ) of 19.69 mA cm − 2 , and open‐circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.48 V.

Such kind of knowledge is advantageous to design of new NLO switches where their ON / OFF states can display their NLO behavior. Based on the significance of nonconjugated crystal systems, the current study aims at identifying the driving forces of the polarizability/first hyperpolarizability through machine learning ( ML ) analysis by growing crystal of 2,4‐diaminotrotriazole. The study shows that how input of a Simplified Molecular Line Entry System ( SMILES ) of compound into a large polarizability/hyperpolarizability data can display its NLO response. The results show a good correlation between their polarizability and the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps. Their SHapley Additive exPlanations ( SHAP ) analysis reveals that the transition dipole moment () between the ground and first excited state is one of the primary contributors for such molecular systems. It is also illustrated that, besides various non‐conjugated related redox states, the ML model can adequately characterize these NLO responses.",

It serves as the foundation for electronic devices, solar cells, and various advanced technologies. The Czochralski method is a prominent technique for producing large single silicon crystals, well‐known for its complexity due to the precise control required over temperature gradients, interface dynamics, and impurity incorporation— all critical factors for growing uniform, high‐quality crystals. This paper proposes a hybrid SyMO (Symbolic regression Multi‐objective Optimization) framework that combines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), machine learning, and mathematical optimization techniques to investigate the effects of various process parameters, furnace geometries, and radiation shield material properties on key crystal quality metrics. The data set created from axisymmetric CFD simulations is used to fit symbolic regression models to effectively capture complex nonlinear relationships, ensuring accurate interface deflection and ratio predictions. The SR equations are integrated into a multi‐objective optimization model that simultaneously optimizes crystal quality and process efficiency. The obtained results are validated through additional CFD simulations to confirm the accuracy of the solution. It is demonstrated that the SyMO successfully generalizes the critical dependencies across various parameters and provides robust, high‐quality solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heat transfer and hydromagnetic flow of ternary hybrid nanofluids between non‐parallel plates are presented in this research work. Lorentz force, nanoparticle shape, heat sink/source, non‐linear solar radiation, and stretching/shrinking wall effects are considered. A polymer base fluid containing hybrid nanoparticles (i.e., nanoparticles) is considered. By utilizing the similarity transformations, the fundamental partial differential equations derived from mathematical modeling are transformed into ordinary differential equations. Thereafter, the computational solution is obtained numerically and analytically. The analytical solution is constructed using an efficient computational technique called the Adomian Decomposition method. To ensure validation, the present results for special cases are compared with those obtained using the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg 4th–5th order (RKF‐45) method. The effects of physical factors on velocity, temperature, and entropy generation are shown graphically. Additionally, the impact of multiple variables on the entropy generation number is demonstrated and examined. It is found that the ternary nanofluid velocity boosts with the increase of the Hartmann number, and hence the reversal flow is entirely delayed. Results obtained also reveal that the presence of ternary nanoparticles within base fluid enhances significantly the heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) in both convergent and divergent channels. In addition, it is also found that the heat source raises the temperature of ternary hybrid nanofluid flow for both converging and diverging channels, whereas the heat sink shows a reverse behavior and mainly leads to a cooling effect. Finally, the heat source/sink parameter, the radiation parameter, and the magnetic field strongly influence the Nusselt number.",

Both the dynamical and the thermal stability of these 1D materials are examined. We demonstrate that their nanowire thinner than 7 Å can be easily obtained by mechanical exfoliation, hydrothermal method, or sonochemical method. The bulk‐to‐1D transition results in dramatic changes in band gap, effective mass, and static dielectric constant due to quantum confinement, making 1D SbSeI a highly promising channel material for transistors with gate length shorter than 1 nm. Under small uniaxial strain, these materials are transformed from indirect into direct band gap semiconductors, paving the way for optoelectronic devices and mechanical sensors. Moreover, the thermoelectric performance of these materials is significantly improved over their bulk counterparts.

However, even the most efficient electronic structure methods such as density functional theory, are too time consuming to explore more than a tiny fraction of all possible hybrid 2D materials. A combination of density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning techniques provide a practical method for exploring this parameter space much more efficiently than by DFT or experiments. As a proof of concept, this methodology is applied to predict the interlayer distance and band gap of bilayer heterostructures.

In all sets, a high degree of agreement is obtained, surpassing well‐established machine learning methods. The general applicability of gpHSP to miscibility of organic semiconductors, drug compounds, and in general solvents is demonstrated, which can be further extended to other domains. gpHSP is a fast and accurate toolbox, which could be applied to molecular design for solution processing technologies.",

This is vital to accurately predict gas adsorption isotherms and guest‐induced flexibility of these materials. First, the performance of three recent models to predict adsorption isotherms and flexibility in MOFs is critically investigated. While these methods succeed in providing qualitative insight in the gas adsorption process in MOFs, their accuracy remains limited as the intrinsic flexibility of these materials is very hard to account for. To overcome this challenge, a hybrid MC/MD simulation protocol that is specifically designed to handle the flexibility of the adsorbent, including the shape flexibility, is introduced, thereby unifying the strengths of the previous models. It is demonstrated that the application of this new protocol to the adsorption of neon, argon, xenon, methane, and carbon dioxide in MIL‐53(Al), a prototypical flexible MOF, substantially decreases the inaccuracy of the obtained adsorption isotherms and predicted guest‐induced flexibility. As a result, this method is ideally suited to rationalize the adsorption performance of flexible nanoporous materials at the molecular level, paving the way for the conscious design of MOFs as industrial adsorbents.",

To provide an understanding of the hydrolytic stability of the representative boronate ester‐linked COF‐5 and of the associated hydrolysis mechanisms, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to characterize the hydrolysis reactions of the molecule formed by the condensation of 1,4‐phenylenebis(boronic acid) (PBBA) and 2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) monomers; two cases were considered, one dealing with the freestanding molecule and the other with the molecule interacting with COF layers. It was found that the boronate ester (B–O) bond dissociation, which requires one H 2 O molecule, has a relatively high energy barrier of 22.3 kcal mol −1 . However, the presence of an additional H 2 O molecule significantly accelerates hydrolysis by reducing the energy barrier by a factor of 3. Importantly, the hydrolysis of boronate ester bonds situated in a COF environment follows reaction pathways that are different and have increased energy barriers. These results point to an enhanced hydrolytic stability of COF‐5 crystals.",

Despite this impressive increase, significant issues still remain due to the intrinsic instability of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 which degrades into carcinogenic PbI 2 . Recently, double halide perovskites which use a pair of 1 + –3 + cations to replace Pb 2+ , such as Cs 2 InSbI 6 , and chalcogenide perovskites, such as BaZrS 3 , have been explored as potential replacements. In this work, double chalcogenide perovskites are explored to identify novel photovoltaic absorbers that can replace CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Due to the large space of possible compounds, machine learning methods are used to classify materials as potential photovoltaic absorbers using data from the periodic table, eliminating wasteful computation. A random forest algorithm achieves a cross‐validation accuracy of 86.4% on the constructed data set. Over 450 possible replacements are identified via traditional and statistical methods with Ba 2 AlNbS 6 , Ba 2 GaNbS 6 , Ca 2 GaNbS 6 , Sr 2 InNbS 6 , and Ba 2 SnHfS 6 as the most promising alternative when thermodynamic stability, kinetic stability, and optical absorption are considered.",

When applying a 0D model, bimolecular recombination is expected to reduce the otherwise linear correlation of the short‐circuit current density J sc and the light intensity Φ to a sublinear trend. It is shown by numerical simulations that the slope of the J sc –Φ curve is affected by the recombination mechanism (direct or via traps), the spatial distribution of charge carriers and—in thick solar cells—by space charge effects.

The adsorption configurations and energetics of several typical VOCs (ethanol, propionaldehyde, acetone, toluene, and hexane) on monolayer BP are examined and it is demonstrated that VOCs generally exhibit stronger interaction with monolayer BP than with the widely studied monolayer MoS 2 , indicative of monolayer BP potentially being a more sensitive VOC sensor. Monolayer BP is shown to exhibit highly anisotropic transport behaviors, whereas the absolute modification of current–voltage responses due to VOCs is found to show a trend that is direction independent. Moreover, the adsorption of VOCs on monolayer BP is strong enough to resist thermal disturbance, yet allows fast recovery time.

    "abstract": "Abstract The current status of the molecular surface property approach (MSPA) and its application for analysis and prediction of intermolecular interactions, including chemical reactivity, are reviewed. The MSPA allows for identification and characterization of all potential interaction sites of a molecule or nanoparticle by the computation of one or more molecular properties on an electronic isodensity surface. A wide range of interactions can be analyzed by three properties, which are well‐defined within Kohn–Sham density functional theory. These are the electrostatic potential, the average local ionization energy, and the local electron attachment energy. The latter two do not only reflect the electrostatic contribution to a chemical interaction, but also the contributions from polarization and charge transfer. It is demonstrated that the MSPA has a high predictive capacity for non‐covalent interactions, for example, hydrogen and halogen bonding, as well as organic substitution and addition reactions. The latter results open up applications within drug design and medicinal chemistry. The application of MSPA has recently been extended to nanoparticles and extended surfaces of metals and metal oxides. In particular, nanostructural effects on the catalytic properties of noble metals are rationalized. The potential for using MSPA in rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is discussed.",

A deep understanding of the molecular‐level structure/property relationships in hydrogels is crucial to progressing these efforts. Such relationships can be challenging to elucidate on the basis of experimental data alone. Here, molecular simulations are used as a complementary strategy to reveal the molecular‐level phenomena that govern the thermo‐mechanical properties of hydrogels. The focus is on acrylamide‐based hydrogels cross‐linked with N , N ′‐methylenebisacrylamide, generated using previously established computational cross‐linking procedure. The water content is found to be a key determinant in the elastic response of these hydrogels, with enhanced tensile and shear properties at low water content. However, it is also found that increasing water content enhances the hydrogel's thermal conductivity, with the dominant contribution arising from the non‐bonded contributions to the heat flux. In addition, chemical cross‐linking improves the heat transfer properties of the hydrogel, whereas a reduction in convective heat transfer is predicted with an increase in hydrogel cross‐linking. These simulations provide a rational basis for designing and testing customized hydrogel formulations for maximizing both thermal conductivity and mechanical properties.",

The widespread use of density functional theory for computing the relative energies of states with different spin in transition metal complexes not only has not discouraged, but often, owing to its limitations, has motivated the development and refinement of first‐principles wavefunction–based methods, including both single‐reference and multireference approaches. A significant boost for the latter has been the emergence of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as a reliable tool in applied quantum chemistry. By enabling the use of larger active spaces than conventionally possible, DMRG has opened up areas of transition metal chemistry that were previously inaccessible to multireference approaches. The present perspective provides an overview of representative studies that make use of DMRG methods and discusses recent applications to spin‐state energetics of transition metal systems. These range from mononuclear to exchange‐coupled systems that define an important emerging field of DMRG applications. Major achievements are highlighted and potential pitfalls are identified with a view toward future methodological developments as well as extensions in the applicability of DMRG‐based approaches to problems of spin‐state energetics and exchange‐coupling in transition metal chemistry.",

However, in the field of soft matter, which includes complex materials such as polymers, liquids, emulsions, colloids, and gels, there is a slower adoption of informatics strategies than in adjacent fields. Here, the current state of soft matter informatics is discussed. Challenges specific to soft materials, including data classification, various degrees of organization at multiple length scales, and process‐dependent properties require unique approaches by researchers in order to develop robust informatics approaches in soft matter. The current ability to extract and analyze the information from the PoLyInfo database is demonstrated by the fitting of the Flory–Fox equation for glass transition temperature for several polymers.

During the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials, it is vitally important to build the relationship between chemical structures and photovoltaic properties.

Here, it is demonstrated that deep learning can be employed to quickly evaluate the performance of new OPV materials. The deep learning model allows direct use of pictures of chemical structures as input, possesses an excellent nonlinear analyzing capability, and has a low demand for computing power. After training the model with a database from the Harvard Clean Energy Project, it is able to predict the photovoltaic performance based on a given chemical structure of an OPV donor material. The prediction accuracy reaches 91.02% using a verification set of 5000 molecules. The codes are converted into visual pictures to understand how features are extracted by the model. In addition, the influence of database size on prediction accuracy is discussed. The model is further tested by using experimentally verified OPV materials and received positive results. Together, the results suggest that deep learning is promising for the quick evaluation of new OPV materials.",

However, the architectures of biomaterials cannot be considered as optimal designs for engineering applications since biomaterials are constantly evolving for multiple functions beyond carrying external loading. Here, it is aimed to develop an intelligent approach to design superior composites from scratch—starting from constituent materials. A systematic computational investigation of the effect of constituent materials (assumed to be perfectly brittle) on the behavior of composites using an integrated approach combining finite element method, molecular dynamics, and machine learning (ML) is reported. It is demonstrated that instead of using brute‐force methods, machine learning is a much more efficient approach and can generate optimal designs with similar performance to those obtained from an exhaustive search. Furthermore, it is shown that the toughening and strengthening mechanism observed in composites at the continuum‐scale by combining stiff and soft constituents is valid for nanomaterials as well. Results show that high‐performing designs of graphene nanocomposites can be generated using our ML approach. This novel ML‐based design framework can be applied to other material systems to study a variety of structure–property relationships over several length‐scales.",

By the heating of differently sized closed pore nanocrystallites, a spontaneous opening is observed with an interface between the closed and open pore phase moving rapidly through the system. The nucleation temperature for the opening transition rises with size. By enforcing the phase transition with a distance restraint, the free energy can be quantified via umbrella sampling. The apparent barrier is substantially lower than for a concerted process under PBC. Interestingly, the barrier reduces with the size of the nanocrystallite, indicating a hindering surface effect. The results demonstrate that the actual free energy barriers and the importance of surface effects for the transformation under real conditions can only be studied beyond PBC.",

Such methods often rely on prior knowledge of the reaction coordinate. However, the search for this reaction coordinate is at the heart of the rare event problem. Transition path sampling (TPS) circumvents this problem by generating an ensemble of dynamical trajectories undergoing the activated event. The reaction coordinate is extracted from the resulting path ensemble using variants of machine learning, making it an output of the method instead of an input. Over the last 20 years, since its inception, many extensions of TPS have been developed. Perhaps surprisingly, large‐scale TPS simulations on complex molecular systems have become possible only recently. Other important developments include the transition interface sampling (TIS) methodology to compute rate constants, the application to multiple states, and adaptive path sampling. The development of OpenPathSampling and PyRETIS has enabled easy and flexible use and implementation of these and other novel path sampling algorithms.

Supported by expert knowledge and informed by reported data, the model incorporates detailed elements of the spreading within a statistically realistic population. Along with pertinent functionality such as testing, treatment, and vaccination options, the model accounts for the burden of other illnesses with symptoms similar to COVID‐19. Unique to the model is the possibility to explore different testing approaches—in hospitals or drive‐through facilities—and vaccination strategies that could prioritize vulnerable groups.

Here, the factors and electronic processes for photocurrent and voltage losses are identified and discussed in the framework of device physics and photophysics. To simultaneously obtain both high photocurrent density and low voltage loss toward 20% PCEs, it is crucial to suppress the non‐radiative (NR) recombination of the lowest charge‐transfer (CT) state at the donor–acceptor interface. In principle, theoretical simulations can provide molecular insight into the origin of these losses, which is essential to guide material design. In particular, the authors highlight the importance of the local interface morphologies and the vibronic couplings on suppressing the NR decay of the lowest CT state according to recent theoretical studies.",

A deep neural network is trained and validated using 128 pore‐scale simulations that provide a quantitative relationship between battery operating conditions and uniformity of the surface reaction for the pore‐scale sample. Using the framework, information about surface reaction uniformity at the pore level to combined uniformity at the device level is upscaled. The information obtained using the framework and deep neural network against the experimental measurements is also validated. Based on the multi‐scale model results, a time‐varying optimization of electrolyte inlet velocity is established, which leads to a significant reduction in pump power consumption for targeted surface reaction uniformity but little reduction in electric power output for discharging.

While bioinspired design of materials is a promising avenue, the possible combination of building blocks in a composite is usually intractable. In this work, a new method is proposed based on reinforcement learning applied as an autonomous agent for arranging the microstructure that is composed of brittle and soft material. The resolution of the design space is enhanced in a progressive fashion, reaching increasingly higher resolution. The results show that the resulting high‐resolution designs can significantly reduce stress concentrations at crack tips and enhance mechanical resilience. Complementing the experimental results with manufactured optimal composites shows excellent agreement with the optimal results obtained using the AI method. The framework reported in this work may serve as an alternative to conventional composite optimization techniques, which often suffer from the curse of high dimensionality and are also unable to effectively predict high‐resolution designs, due to limitations of the algorithms to escape low‐resolution local minima. The new approach discussed in this work can be widely applied in multiple areas of engineering and design, and the progressive multiresolution approach may also be critical for the de novo autonomous reinforcement engineering solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Elman neural network (ENN) is one of the local recursive networks with a feedback mechanism. The parameter conjugate gradient method is a promising alternative to the gradient descent method, due to its faster convergence speed that results from searching for the conjugate descent direction with an adaptive step size (obtained by Wolfe conditions). However, there are still some challenges such as how to avoid the sawtooth phenomenon in gradient algorithms to improve the learning accuracy of the second‐order curvature of an objective function. As such, this paper presents a novel parametric conjugate gradient method that is based on the secant equation for training ENN in an effective way. Strict proof of the theoretical convergence of the proposed algorithm is provided in detail. In particular, the weak convergence and strong convergence of the algorithm, as well as the monotonicity of the error function are proved. Except for the theoretical analysis, the three numerical experiments have been conducted by applying the algorithm to three problems of classification, regression, and function approximation on nine real‐world datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and the correctness of this theoretical analysis.",

The single‐layer MS is composed of a periodic array of the combination of the metal DASR and complementary circular patch (CCP) adhered on an ultrathin dielectric substrate. Numerical results show that the MS structure can convert CP wave to its orthogonal component after reflection and transmission simultaneously, and the corresponding amplitudes are ≈0.45 on average from 0.45 to 1.75 THz with a relative bandwidth of 118.2%, in which the CP conversion efficiency is closing to theoretical limit (25%) of the single‐layer structure. Furthermore, the 0–2π phase shifts for the reflected and transmitted orthogonal CP wave can be achieved simultaneously by adjusting the oriented angle (α) of the DASR structure along the wave propagation direction. For the concept proofs, wave beams deflection, vortex beam generation, and focusing effect for both reflection and transmission modes are demonstrated numerically. The design can provide new possibilities and potential to develop multifunctional full‐space devices.",

The mechanical properties and shape memory processes of these structures are investigated in detail. The proposed origami metastructures exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio and demonstrate excellent energy storage capabilities. Notably, their mechanical properties can be programmed by controlling both temperature and geometric parameters. More particularly, their Poisson's ratio can be tuned within a range of zero to −1. As a result, these truncated cuboctahedral origami metastructures hold significant potential for applications across various engineering domains, particularly in composite structures and active metamaterials.",

Additionally, 2D XS 2 @graphene heterojunction is considered an excellent host material for batteries.

Moreover, a low diffusion barrier (0.31 eV) for Na ion diffusion shows that this heterojunction can enhance electrochemical processes.

First, the original bearing vibration signals are converted into 2D grayscale images; then, these grayscale images are used as inputs to the 2D convolutional neural network for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction; finally, the obtained feature vectors are passed to the hybrid kernel fuzzy support vector machine for fault detection. Compared with the support vector machine (SVM), the fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) assigns different weights to different bearing fault samples through the fuzzy membership function, thereby reducing the impact of noise on the classification results. Furthermore, the hybrid kernel function combined according to Mercer's theorem enables the FSVM to take both global and local fitting into account, further improving the classification performance of the FSVM.

Curvature is induced by pulling a tether, that is, a bilayer nanotube, from a flat membrane. Pulling is performed both from the inner and outer leaflets, corresponding to directions in and out of the cell. Redistribution of different lipid types between the tether and the bilayer is observed, leading to spatial variations in the composition of both leaflets, and, in turn, softening of the tether. Depending on the direction of pulling, the lipid distributions and the tether properties differ. Formation of a tether from the planar membrane thus induces lipid sorting without phase separation.",

In ML WS 2 FETs, the interfacial properties between ML WS 2 and electrodes significantly affect the device performance, due to the possible existence of Schottky barriers at the interface. In this paper, the electronic and transport properties of both the lateral and the vertical interfaces between ML WS 2 and six common metals is calculated (Sc, Ti, Ag, Cu, Au, and Pt) by the density functional theory and the quantum transport simulation. n ‐type Schottky contact exists with the lateral electron Schottky barrier height (SBH) of 0.28, 0.36, 0.25, 0.46, 1.00 eV for Sc, Ti, Ag, Cu, and Au electrode, respectively, while p ‐type Schottky contact exists with the lateral hole SBH of 0.98 eV for Pt electrode. The average pinning factor at the lateral interface obtained from linear fitting to the SBHs and the Schottky–Bardin model is 0.32 and 0.28, respectively, suggestive of a strong Fermi level pinning originating from the metal induced gap states.

Coding metasurfaces or programmable metasurfaces are special phase‐manipulation type metasurfaces, which can be used for dynamic electromagnetic modulation and information processing in microwave band. However, programmable or tunable coding metasurfaces in terahertz band are still rare. All‐optical switchable coding metasurfaces based on vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) hybrid resonators are proposed for dynamic modulation of terahertz waves. The C‐shaped metal–VO 2 hybrid resonators are switched from anisotropic structures to quasi‐isotropic ones due to insulator–metal transition of VO 2 , resulting in great attenuation of conversion efficiency for linearly polarized waves and Pancharatnam–Berry phase for circularly polarized waves. Based on this principle, several coding metasurfaces are shown for efficient and simultaneous switching of wavefront and polarization state of terahertz beams, including linearly and circularly polarized waves. It is worth mentioning that a new method for switchable shared‐aperture metasurfaces is also proposed, in which only a part of the unit cells are integrated with VO 2 and tunable. This new scheme promotes the applications of terahertz coding metasurfaces such as high‐speed terahertz communication.",

The protocol is based on ensemble averaging to generate accurate assessments of the uncertainties in the predictions. Comparison is made between FEP+ and TIES—free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration with enhanced sampling—the latter with and without the so‐called “enhanced sampling” based on replica‐exchange protocols. Standard TIES performs best for a reference set of targets and compounds; no benefits accrue from replica‐exchange methods. Evaluation of FEP+ and TIES with REST—replica‐exchange with solute tempering—reveals a systematic and significant underestimation of free energy differences in FEP+, which becomes increasingly large for long duration simulations, is confirmed by extensive analysis of previous publications, and raises a number of questions pertaining to the accuracy of the predictions with the REST technique not hitherto discussed.",

However, new machine learning‐based representations of complex potential energy surfaces have been introduced in recent years to circumvent computationally demanding AIMD simulations while retaining the same level of accuracy. As these machine learning methods gain in popularity over the next decade, it is important to address the appropriate way to develop and integrate them with well‐established simulation methods. This paper details the parameterization and training, using accurate electronic structure calculations, of artificial neural network potentials (NNPs) to model the intermolecular interactions in a hydrogen clathrate hydrate, wherein hydrogen molecules are confined inside the cavities of the 3D crystalline framework of hydrogen‐bonded water molecules. This new NNP is used in conjunction with new path‐integral based enhanced sampling methods, for inclusion of nuclear quantum effects and promotion of free energy barrier crossing, in order to determine properties that are important for understanding the diffusion of hydrogen gas in the clathrate system. These simulations demonstrate the influence of cage occupancy on the free energy barriers that determine the diffusivity of hydrogen gas through the network of large cages.",

Moreover, a series of large‐scale phase‐field simulations shed light on the topics at issue including competitive growth of dendrites during the directional solidification, the effect of forced and natural convections on the solidification, and so on.

Since computing electronic properties, such as the intermolecular transfer integral, using quantum chemical (QC) methods requires a high computational cost, existing models assume several approximations. A machine learning (ML)–based multiscale approach is presented that allows to simulate charge transport in organic semiconductors considering the static disorder within disordered crystals. By mapping fingerprints of dimers to their respective transfer integral, a kernel ridge regression ML algorithm for the prediction of charge transfer integrals is trained and evaluated. Since QC calculations of the electronic structure must be performed only once, the use of ML reduces the computation time radically, while maintaining the prediction error small. Transfer integrals predicted by ML are utilized for the computation of charge carrier mobilities using off‐lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Benefiting from the rapid performance of ML, microscopic processes can be described accurately without the need for phenomenological approximations. The multiscale system is tested with the well‐known molecular semiconductor pentacene. The presented methodology allows reproducing the experimentally observed anisotropy of the mobility and enables a fast estimation of the impact of disorder.",

Such an approach implicitly provides useful information about the role of different features (such as geometrical design parameters) of the nanostructure in its response functionality. To demonstrate the practical capabilities of this DL‐based technique, it is applied to a reconfigurable optical metadevice enabling dual‐band and triple‐band optical absorption in the telecommunication window. Combination of the proposed approach with existing commercialized full‐wave simulation tools offers a powerful toolkit to extract basic mechanisms of wave–matter interaction in complex EM devices and facilitate the design and optimization of nanostructures for a large range of applications including imaging, spectroscopy, and signal processing. It is worth mentioning that the demonstrated approach is general and can be used in a large range of problems as long as enough training data are provided.",

The efficacy of the algorithm, and the assessment of clustering result, are both confirmed using large benchmark two dimensional synthetic data sets, and small multidimensional data describing a set of silver nanoparticles.

The Bloch equations are here treated as a density matrix model for driven quantum systems with two or multiple discrete energy levels, where dissipation is included by Lindblad terms. Furthermore, the one-dimensional MB equations for semiconductor waveguide structures and optical fibers are rigorously derived. Special analytical solutions and suitable numerical methods are presented. Due to the importance of the MB equations in computational electrodynamics, an emphasis is placed on the comparison of different numerical schemes, both with and without the rotating wave approximation. The implementation of additional effects which can become relevant in semiconductor structures, such as spatial hole burning, inhomogeneous broadening and local-field corrections, is discussed. Finally, links to microscopic models and suitable extensions of the Lindblad formalism are briefly addressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Smart composite materials fabricated through 4D‐printing methods are attracting enormous research attention for their ability to respond (typically deform) under external stimuli. The design process for such smart materials requires iterations of finite‐element simulations that are computationally expensive. Recently, researchers have tried replacing numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) models to predict the output at a much higher speed. However, there exist very few studies that explore the model algorithm's expressive capacity and analyze the physical interpretation based on the problem. This paper focuses on using ML to predict the nonlinear deformation behavior of digital materials. Various problem construction approaches and model performance are compared and discussed. It is shown that clustering the materials helps improve the generalization of training and models that treat material features as an array of numbers still face difficulties to provide accurate predictions. Inspired by modern computer vision technologies, convolutional kernels outperform other methods by recognizing the material distribution patterns. The performance is further enhanced after reconstructing the regression problem into classification. Moreover, high‐level material design information can be extracted from the model through a sensitivity analysis. This framework may greatly improve the response prediction and design process for 4D‐printed smart materials.",

Comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on N 2 activation by boron species, specifically for the experimentally more accessible tricoordinated boron compounds. Subsequently designed frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) combining screened N ‐heterocyclic carbene with boron moieties can make N 2 activation both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable, displaying high potential for metal‐free N 2 activation. The significant thermodynamic stability of the products stabilized by aromaticity and low activation barriers could be a breakthrough for the development of FLP chemistry on metal‐free N 2 activation.",

Applying the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) approach, simulations can be performed with more than 1000 atoms, which is infeasible for FPMD simulations. Additionally, the partial radial distribution functions, angle distribution functions, densities, and self‐diffusion coefficients predicted by DPMD simulations are also in reasonable agreement with FPMD or experimental results.

The studied gas molecules are acetone, ethanol, methanol, and toluene as main members of VOCs, along with CO 2 and H 2 O gas molecules. The adsorption of the gases on the pristine and Pd‐decorated phosphorene is studied by employing first‐principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with non‐equilibrium Green's function (NEGF). It is divulged that the selected molecules are weakly adsorbed upon the pristine phosphorene, but after decoration with Pd atom, the adsorption energy, and net charge transfer are improved. It is discovered based on the moderate adsorption energy and large charge transfer for acetone on the Pd‐decorated phosphorene that it can be a suitable sensor for acetone detection. Additionally, recovery time of 2.57 s at the temperature of 350 K, and under ultraviolet (UV) light is achieved after decoration for detection of acetone. Therefore, the authors' theoretical investigations help to better understand the adsorption mechanism of Pd‐decorated phosphorene as a gas sensor and provide a facile approach to broaden its application in industrial, medical, and environmental monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dielectric energy storage capacitors are receiving a great deal of attention owing to their high energy density and fast charging–discharging speed. The current energy storage density of dielectrics is relatively low and cannot meet the requirements of miniaturization of pulsed power equipment. Therefore, increasing the energy storage density of dielectrics has become a research hotspot. Herein, using phase‐field simulations to design polymorphic nanodomains, the strain engineering of energy storage performance of binary and ternary solid solution relaxor ferroelectric films is investigated. The results show that the energy storage performance of the ternary film is better than that of the binary film due to the polymorphic nanodomains. In addition, as the film in‐plane strain is modified from −2% to 2%, the energy density is improved by 80%, and the efficiency also increases from 52% to 77%. This work proves the remarkable energy storage performance of polymorphic films and provides a theoretical basis to optimize the energy‐storage performance of ferroelectric thin‐film capacitors by adjusting the misfit strain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular engineering is driving the recent efficiency leaps in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A presynthetic determination of frontier energy levels makes the screening of potential molecules more efficient, exhaustive, and cost‐effective. Here, a convolutional neural network is developed to predict the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) levels of donor molecules for OPV. The model takes a 2D structure image and returns a prediction of its HOMO/LUMO levels comparable to experimental values. Insufficient experimental datasets are overcome with transfer learning where the model is initially trained on the large Harvard Clean Energy Project dataset and then fine‐tuned using experimental data from the Harvard Organic Photovoltaic dataset. Error margins on predicted HOMO/LUMO levels below 200 meV are achieved, without any chemical knowledge implemented. Noticeably, the model outputs have higher accuracy and precision than corresponding density functional theory (DFT) estimations. The model and its limitations are further tested on a home‐built dataset of commercially available donor polymers reported in OPVs (e.g., P3HT, PTB7‐Th, PM6, D18). The results demonstrate both the practical utility of this model, to foster rational molecular engineering for OPV optimization, and the potential for deep learning techniques, in general, to revolutionize the energy materials research and development sector.",

    "abstract": "Abstract C Perovskite–perovskite tandem solar cells (P‐TSCs) are an attractive option to overcome the limitation of Si‐based solar cells due to their ability to deposit in both the top and bottom cells by a simple solution process. Despite these advantages, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P‐TSCs still falls behind that of Si‐perovskite tandem devices and is highly limited by the nonradiative recombination between the perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) interface. In this work, with the help of numerical simulations (SCAPS 1D), the influence of the various ETLs on the performance of P‐TSCs is studied. Different ETLs such as C 60 , PCBM, ZnO, WO 3 , CdSe, and In 2 O 3 , BCP are incoroprated, which directly interface with the perovskite absorber layer in top (high bandgap absorber layer) and bottom subcell (low bandgap absorber layer) of P‐TSC. The simulation analysis shows that reducing the interface surface defect density and band offsets at the ETL/perovskite interface significantly helps achieving high‐efficiency P‐TSC over 35% . Various remediation for incorporating present simulation analysis into practical devices for better‐performing P‐TSCs is also provided. The analysis provides a pathway toward understanding the reasons behind the current trend of low PCE in 2 terminal P‐TSC and achieving high‐efficiency P‐TSC solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Phononic crystals exhibit Bragg bandgaps, frequency regions within which wave propagation is forbidden. In solid continua, bandgaps are the outcome of destructive interferences resulting from periodically alternating layers. Under certain conditions, natural frequencies emerge within these bandgaps in the form of high-amplitude localized vibrations near a structural boundary, referred to as truncation resonances. In this paper, we investigate the vibrational spectrum of finite phononic crystals which take the form of a one-dimensional rod, and explain the factors that contribute to the origination of truncation resonances. By identifying a unit cell symmetry parameter, we define a family of finite phononic rods which share the same dispersion relation, yet distinct truncated forms. A transfer matrix method is utilized to derive closed-form expressions of the characteristic equations governing the natural frequencies of the finite system and decipher the truncation resonances emerging across different boundary conditions. The analysis establishes concrete connections between the localized vibrations associated with a truncation resonance, boundary conditions, and the overall configuration of the truncated chain as dictated by unit cell choice. The study provides tools to predict, tune, and selectively design truncation resonances, to meet the demands of various applications that require and uniquely benefit from such truncation resonances.",

The self‐affine nature of analyzed surfaces is confirmed from the autocorrelation function. The dynamic scaling exponents indicate the existence of Kardar–Parisi–Zhang scaling in surface growth. In addition, the trend of generalized Hurst exponent and mass exponent indicates insignificant multifractal characteristics in the analyzed surfaces. Moreover, fractal analysis explains and aids to description of roughening trend from stereometric and Minkowski functionals analysis. Furthermore, the significance of fractal dimension for probing the surface roughening is validated from the principal component analysis.

    "abstract": "Abstract Semi‐transparent perovskite solar cells (ST‐PSCs) offer a promising pathway for use in building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems instead of conventional panels’ roofs. Furthermore, their potential for bifacial operation, allowing light absorption from both sides, creates new opportunities for their integration as solar cells windows, and greatly improves energy harvesting capacities. This combination of bifaciality and flexibility enhances their efficiency and adaptability, making them well‐suited for integration into various architectural elements. Herein, in this study, the performance of 40 different configurations of bifacial flexible semi‐transparent inverted perovskite solar cells (BF‐STIPSCs) is explored. Using SCAPS‐1D (version 3.3.11), a 3D‐perovskite (PVK) absorber layer is modeled and combined with polymer‐based electron transport layers (ETLs) such as C 60 and BCP, along with innovative hole transport layers (HTLs) including D‐PBTTT‐14, Me‐4PACz, NiOx, PANI, Poly‐TPD, PATAA, SrCuO 2 , V 2 O 5 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, a paradigm shift toward the tremendous use of portable and mobile consumer products is observed and it consequently increases the battery demand. Currently, lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are used in almost all kinds of devices, however, the increased usage of LIBs raises some safety concerns. For safe operation, it is necessary to investigate the all important chemical and physical features of LIBs. Several mathematical models are proposed such as equivalent circuit models (ECMs), physics‐based ECM and electrochemical models (EMs). Among them pseudo‐two‐dimensional (P2D) model is most famous and comprehensive physics‐based EM and used frequently to study the battery electrochemical phenomena. Hence, the focus of this review work is to summarize the reported literature on the P2D model governing laws, its simplified models, coupled models, solution techniques, parameter analysis, and its applications. The literature survey shows that the P2D and its simplified models are very helpful to analyze the important aspects of LIBs such as state of charge, state of health, recycling, battery manufacturing and design etc. Also, it can be seen that no single model can be fit to study every aspect of LIBs and design a comprehensive battery management system (BMS) but different models can be used to address the specific applications.",

It is found that LaMnO 3 exhibits higher ORR activity than others with ORR overpotential ( η ORR ) of 0.57 V, but its OER activity is poor with OER overpotential ( η OER ) of 1.12 V. The η ORR (0.59 V) and η OER (1.13 V) of LaMn 0.75 Fe 0.25 O 3 closely resemble those of LaMnO 3 , suggesting that Fe substitution does not yield appreciable enhancements in activity. Fe substitution reduces the ORR and OER activity because the adsorption energies of intermediate species on Fe‐substituted LPOs surfaces are too strong to obtain a potential determining step for ORR and OER. According to Sabatier's principle, the LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 demonstrates superior OER activity compared to the other composition, while ORR activity approximates that of LaMnO 3 , evidenced by η ORR of 0.65 V and η OER of 0.53 V. The Co‐terminated LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 shows bifunctional activity higher than Mn/Co termination, indicating that Co is an active site for OER and Mn is a promoter for improved ORR activity.",

Transition metal atoms atomically dispersed on a solid support represent a promising approach to the design of new catalytic materials. The interest for single‐ (SACs) and dual‐atom catalysts (DACs) is steadily growing. In general, DACs are considered more active than SACs for NRR. In this work, the complex chemistry behind NRR is investigated on a set of SACs and DACs by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that self‐interaction corrected exchange‐correlation functionals must be adopted, at variance with several studies in the literature. Furthermore, it is not possible to extrapolate results obtained on conventional extended catalytic surfaces to SACs and DACs, due to a richer scenario of possible reaction paths. In general, the results show a positive effect on the catalytic activity moving from 3d to 5d metals, and from SACs and DACs. However, if the two effects work together, that is, 5d metals in DACs, the reaction intermediates may be too strongly bound, thus resulting in reduced catalytic activity. In this respect, the fact that DACs are expected to be superior to SACs in NRR is not always verified.",

The phosphorus molar fraction can be adjusted to achieve lattice‐matched AlPN/GaN heterojunctions with strong spontaneous polarization. This consequently induces more electrons at the interface, resulting in lower sheet resistance compared to an AlGaN/GaN heterojunction, making AlPN an optimal barrier in high electron mobility transistors High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). In this work, an AlPN/GaN HEMT is simulated and compared with a corresponding AlGaN/GaN HEMT. The AlPN/GaN HEMT exhibits a maximum drain current density of 1.85 A/mm, which is double that of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT, enabling this device to achieve higher power densities at high frequencies. The AlPN/GaN HEMT shows a peak transconductance of 0.293 S/mm, more than three times higher than that of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT, which can be exploited for sensor applications, as the sensitivity of the HEMT is directly proportional to the transconductance. Furthermore, the AlPN/GaN HEMT attained a lower noise figure than the AlGaN/GaN HEMT, which is crucial for low‐noise amplifier design. Therefore, it is beneficial to improve the fabrication and growth techniques of AlPN devices for stable production.",

To explore this, the effects of O 2 and H 2 O molecules on BP layers are elucidated using reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations at constant concentrations of molecules and room temperature. As a potential solution, the passivation efficacy of 1,4,5,8‐naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) is evaluated. The initial oxidation processes are analyzed through atomic structural changes, charge dynamics, and radial distribution functions. Moreover, the thickness of the oxidized BP layers is quantitatively determined. Results show that elevated O 2 concentrations significantly accelerate oxidation and increase the thickness of the oxidized layers, while H 2 O has a weaker influence. The interaction between O⁻ and H⁺ ions in H 2 O reduces its interaction with BP, but O 2 molecules cause H 2 O to become negatively charged, allowing it to interact with P⁺ ions. Importantly, passivating BP with NTCDA effectively mitigates oxidation, creating a protective layer that repels O 2 molecules. Ultimately, this study reveals the initial oxidation and passivation processes of BP layers, offering crucial theoretical insights to guide experimental methods and practical applications in semiconductor devices.",

Analytical formulas of linear and third order nonlinear optical of susceptibility χ (3) as well as the CDF are derived by compact‐density matrix formalism applied to a two‐state system. Numerical results indicated that electron energy states exhibited a complex dependence on both core and shell ellipticity ( δ 1 and δ 2 ) along with witnessed red and blue shifts due to anisotropic quantum confinement along the major and minor axes. The oscillator strengths of quantum transitions non‐monotonously depend on the structural anisotropy of the layers due to the different location of carriers. More importantly, computations showed that resonant peaks of real and imaginary parts of CDF could be precisely modulated through the dielectric medium, shape‐induced effects and size parameters. The Eccentricity of the core seems to dominate over that of the shell affecting the amplitude of computed nonlinear properties. Our model can be engineered to optimize electron transport by enhancing energy confinement and protecting quantum information from destructive interference mechanisms.",

Given the limitations of current therapies, there is an urgent demand for novel drugs. The enzyme glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), essential to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and frequently associated with cancer cell metabolism, presents a promising target for cancer treatment. However, no G6PD inhibitor is yet validated as an approved drug. This study focuses on the in silico assessment and comparative analysis of the anticancer potential of five G6PD inhibitors: glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor 1 (G6PDi1), 3alpha,21‐Dihydroxy‐5alpha‐pregnant‐20‐one (THDOC), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 6‐aminonicotinamide (6‐AN), and polydatin (PD). Molecular docking results show that G6PDi1 exhibits the highest binding affinity (−8.65 kcal mol −1 ) among the inhibitors tested. ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) pharmacokinetics, and biological activity assessments identified PD, THDOC, and G6PDi1 as the most promising G6PD inhibitors. Furthermore, a 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with Molecular Mechanics/Poisson‐Boltzmann surface (MM‐PBSA) post‐simulation analysis indicated stability and compactness for all compounds, with no significant deviations observed throughout the simulation period. These findings suggest THDOC and G6PDi1 as potential candidates for developing effective cancer therapeutics targeting G6PD.",

It predicts stable crystal structures within binary and ternary systems by systematically evaluating various structural descriptors and machine learning algorithms. The superiority of models based on atomic coordination environments is shown, with transfer‐learned graph neural networks emerging as a particularly promising technique. By validating the proposed method on Cs–Te crystals, its ability to generate stable crystal structures is proved, suggesting its potential for advancing established computational schemes.",

Atomic model of surface fretting wear of silicon nitride bearing is constructed by molecular dynamics method and deep learning self‐fitting potential function. First principles are used to match silicon nitride crystal parameters; Dynamic analysis of fretting wear process of nanoscale silicon nitride bearing is realized. Experiment shows that friction force in the Z direction is a maximum of 3.5 nN. The output potential energy 2.31 × 10 7 eV is 1.63 times that of the y ‐axis, which is main factor causing the fretting wear. The force perpendicular to the direction of roller and the collar of silicon nitride bearings should be avoided in the process of using or transporting the bearings. Silicon nitride bearing fretting wear process is non‐transient elastic stress‐strain, along the rolling plane extension, in the roller rolling direction to form a sharp angle shape high strain linear region. Bearing Z direction damage degree increased; Silicon nitride bearing surface layer has 22.47% of the N─Si bond fracture. The study of the fretting wear characteristics of silicon nitride ceramic bearings has a reference value for reducing the surface friction of silicon nitride bearings and improving the life of silicon nitride bearings.",

(FA) 2 BiCuI 6 and Cs 2 AgBi 0.75 Sb 0.25 Br 6 . The optoelectronic properties of these materials indicate high absorption coefficient with minimum reflection coefficients, making them appropriate for photon absorption. The performance of (FA) 2 BiCuI 6 and Cs 2 AgBi 0.75 Sb 0.25 Br 6 based modeled cells are examined for several combinations of electron and hole transport materials using SCAPS‐1D and the optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.3% and 11.1% are achieved by simulating the architectures FTO/SnO 2 /(FA) 2 BiCuI 6 /Cu 2 O/Au and FTO/SnO 2 /Cs 2 AgBi 0.75 Sb 0.25 Br 6 /Cu 2 O/Au, respectively. Further, this work employs the bandgap grading scheme to enhance their PCEs. The efficiency of cells further improves to 14.8% and 12.2% credited to the reduction in interfacial recombination with bandgap graded absorber layers. Moreover, the comparative investigations are also done in terms of absorber layer defect density and working temperature. The findings provide valuable insights into designing of highly efficient Pb‐free double perovskite solar cells as the promising alternative to conventional Pb based halide perovskite photovoltaic cells.",

The combined effects of periodic treatments and stochastic variations are analyzed, offering valuable insights into disease progression and therapeutic strategies. The model is constructed using three auxiliary equations to establish the existence, positivity, and uniqueness of solutions. The global stability of the system's solutions is demonstrated through the construction of a Lyapunov function, while the boundedness of the solution's expectation is verified using a comparison theorem for impulsive equations. Criteria for the extinction and non‐persistence of healthy cells, cancer cells, and immune populations are derived, along with conditions for the weak and stochastic persistence of cancer cells.

Furthermore, optimizing the electrochemical performance of the battery prevents its chemical aging, which can be verified by tuning the kinetic and diffusion parameters of the electrodes and electrolyte/electrode interface. This work focuses on predicting the diffusion parameters of metal batteries that are currently not experimentally realized in laboratory conditions. First, diffusion equations are used to analyze the relation between the diffusion coefficient and Warburg factor for the monovalent and multivalent metal ion batteries to predict the theoretical values of the diffusion coefficient at different temperatures. Second, the relationship between the charge transfer resistance and the Warburg factor is modeled to predict speculative behavior and calculate the fitting parameters. Finally, the modeled Randles‐Sevcik equation indicated the relationship between peak current and the scan rate at different diffusion coefficients.

For the purpose of studying nanoparticle aggregation, the improved Maxwell‐Bruggeman and Krieger‐Dougarty models are applied. By applying the similarity transformation, the simple partial differential equations that arise from mathematical modeling are transformed into nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The calculated nonlinear equation is then numerically solved using the Runge‐Kutta‐Fehlberg 4th‐5th (RKF45) order method with shooting technique and analytically via the Adomian decomposition method (ADM). For validation, the outcomes of this inquiry are linked with those outcomes that are available in the literature. In addition, the acquired analytical ADM data are compared to numerical RKF45, homotopy analysis method (HAM)‐package values, and those given in the literature. It is found that the skin friction coefficient is also lower in the presence of aggregation effects than in the absence of such effects. Furthermore, when the sheet is shrinking, the heat transport (HT) coefficient decreases and increases, respectively, with stretching. The aggregation of nanoparticles reduces the HT coefficient.",

Our computations reveal that Fe/defective BN, Co/defective BN, and Pt/defective BN nanosheets possess outstanding ECR activities with quite low (less negative) onset potentials of −0.52, −0.68, and −0.60 V, respectively. Given that Fe and Co are nonprecious metals, Fe/defective BN and Co/defective BN may provide cost‐effective electrocatalysts. The high ECR activities of these TM/defective BN catalyst systems stem from the moderate electrocatalysts’ affinities for C and O, which modulate the free energies of ECR intermediates in the reaction pathways. Moreover, it is found that Fe/defective BN and Pt/defective BN show high selectivity of ECR to CH 4 . This finding highlights a strategy to design highly active and selective single‐atom electrocatalysts for ECR to CH 4 .",

However, due to the lack of high‐quality THz sources and detectors, the sensitivity that has been demonstrated with THz sensors is far from the level needed to detect small amounts of sample, like monolayer biomolecules. This puts forward an urgent requirement for a THz biosensor with ultra‐high sensitivity. Here, a theoretical design is proposed using a bilayer metasurface to construct a two‐resonator coupled system that obeys passive parity time symmetry and that possesses an exceptional point. By designing the coupled resonators to have orthogonal excitation orientations and retrieving the eigenfrequencies in polarization space, eigenfrequency splitting even smaller than the resonance linewidth can be distinguished, and thus attain ultra‐high THz sensitivity. Electromagnetic simulations show that the sensitivity, defined as the frequency change per micrometer in thickness and per refractive index unit (RIU) of the analyte, can reach 800 GHz RIU −1 µm −1 , an order of magnitude higher than the values reported in previous work. This proposed high‐sensitivity approach could open a path toward the detection of monolayer molecules at THz frequencies.",

This approach avoids the need of encoding all of the information about the molecular Hamiltonian in a quantum circuit.

Set and reset processes are explained in the model by the evolution of the CF length and radius driven by electrical and thermal forces.

The moth eye surface texture represents a refractive index grating that allows for an efficient incoupling of light in the solar cell while minimizing reflection losses. The light incoupling is studied for perovskite and amorphous silicon solar cells. Perovskite has a rather low refractive index of ≈2.5, while amorphous silicon exhibits a refractive index of ≈4.5 comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Due to largely different refractive indices, different device designs must be selected to allow for an efficient light incoupling in the solar cell. 3D finite‐difference time‐domain simulations are used for the optical modeling.

In this work, a millimeter‐wave (mmW) digital coding metasurface based on nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) is proposed and realized. By tuning the bias voltage loaded on the NLCs, the effective permittivity of the NLCs substrate is changed, thus providing different reflection phases. As a proof of concept, mmW beam splitting and mmW beam steering at mmW frequencies are demonstrated using a single metasurface platform. The experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations. The proposed digital coding metasurfaces have promising applications on planar mmW devices, such as multi‐beam antennas, beam‐scanning antennas, and wave controllers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modeling can provide guidelines for improving the mechanical properties, durability, and sustainability of concrete, which is the most important and widely used construction material in today's world. This review aims to summarize the modeling of cementitious materials from the historical perspective. The development of macroscopic constitutive models and computational methods for concrete at macro‐scale is presented first. However, the existing macroscopic models are insufficient to explain fundamentally the deformation and failure of concrete. In order to understand the atomic interaction that governs the material behavior, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should be adopted in order to understand the fundamental deformation mechanisms of cement, fiber‐reinforced polymers (FRP), and related systems. Coupled with the development of nano‐scale modeling, multi‐scale modeling is introduced in order to build linkage between nano‐scale and macro‐scale models. This paper provides a clear understanding of the limitations and potentials of different modeling methods, as well as the development trend of cementitious materials. The future prospect of the nano‐engineering approach is illustrated so as to inspire the improvement of construction materials. Additionally, the key challenges associated with cementitious material modeling are discussed.",

Concerning the electromagnetic response of nanoplasmonic systems, several hydrodynamic models have been proposed, each introducing an additional boundary condition (ABC) to describe the behavior of the plasmonic electron cloud. Four hydrodynamic approaches with four different boundary conditions are compared: the hard wall hydrodynamic model with the Sauter ABC, the curl‐free hydrodynamic model with the Pekar ABC, the shear forces hydrodynamic model with the specular reflection ABC, and the quantum hydrodynamic model with the corresponding ABC. This is done by investigating near‐ and far‐field features of a metallic nanosphere. It is shown that different hydrodynamic models may result in an entirely different prediction of the nanoparticle's response. These models are validated by using other local and nonlocal response models and experimental results.",

The underlying mechanism for the process—whether via energy or electron transfer from the photoexcited catalyst to RAFT agent—has remained unclear, as has the reason for the remarkable selectivity. Quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations are utilized to provide strong evidence that none of the common energy‐transfer mechanisms (Förster resonance energy transfer; Dexter electron exchange; or internal conversion followed by vibrational energy transfer) are likely to facilitate polymerization, let alone explain the observed selectivities. In contrast, extensive quantum chemical characterizations of the excited‐state orbitals associated with the catalyst–RAFT agent complexes uncover a clear selectivity pattern associated with charge‐transfer states that is highly consistent with experimental findings. The results shed light on the intrinsic catalytic role of the photocatalysts and provide a strong indication that a reversible electron/charge‐transfer mechanism underpins the remarkable photocatalytic selectivity.",

Caused by the sophisticated interactions between foulant and membrane surface, fouling strongly depends on membrane surface chemistry and roughness. Current studies in the field have been largely focused on polymer membranes. Herein, a molecular dynamics simulation study is reported for fouling on alumina and graphene membrane surfaces during water treatment. For two foulants (sucralose and bisphenol A), it is found that the fouling on alumina surfaces is reduced with increasing surface roughness; however, the fouling on graphene surfaces is enhanced by roughness. It is unravelled that the foulant–surface interaction becomes weaker in the ridge region of a rough alumina surface, thus allowing foulant to leave the surface and reducing fouling. Nevertheless, such behavior is not observed on a rough graphene surface because of strong foulant–graphene interaction. In addition, with increasing roughness, the hydrogen bonds between water and alumina surface are found to increase in number as well as stability. This simulation study reveals that surface chemistry and roughness play a crucial role in membrane fouling, and the microscopic insights are useful for the design of new membranes toward high‐performance water treatment.",

However, most free‐space metasurfaces and existing integrated metadevices do not meet the criteria of full on‐chip integration toward low loss and high information transmission capacity. Here, by decorating silicon‐on‐insulator waveguides with metasurfaces, one can realize the arbitrary phase and intensity manipulation of guided waves. Four‐channel multiplexer is demonstrated with inherent advantages of low loss and independent transmission of electromagnetic waves in x and y directions. As proof‐of‐concept demonstrations, monolithic‐integrated multiplexed orbital angular momentum (OAM) and holographic generators are developed at 1550 nm to realize high information transmission capacity, low loss, and low crosstalk. Specifically, when the electromagnetic wave is incident from x , − x , y , and − y directions, four kinds of OAM mode with different topological charge values (−1, +1, +2, and −2), and four different holographic images of the letter “U,” “C,” “A,” and “S” can be obtained with the four‐channel multiplexed OAM generator and holographic display device, respectively. The design methods proposed here are expected to open a new perspective for future versatile utilization of driven guided waves to achieve numerous functionalities.",

The control input signals including control forces and moment are quantized by a hybrid quantizer which is the combinination of a logarithmic quantizer and a uniform quantizer. The kinematic controller is designed by the backstepping control technique and the dynamic controller is developed using the sliding mode control method. In order to further improve the robustness of the closed‐loop system, an adaptive law is employed to estimate the upper bound of the total uncertainties in real time. The stability of the closed‐loop system is proved based on the Lyapunov theory and indicates that the proposed control method can force the AUV to track the desired trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",

This study presents the design of a novel bidirectional mechanical metamaterial with tunable stiffness and energy dissipation. By leveraging the phenomenon of Coulomb friction, the metamaterial dissipates energy when a small gap closes and two walls slide across one another under planar loading. The conceptual design of the metamaterial is parameterized, so the material behavior can be tailored to a particular application. A computational framework is built, using finite element analysis and a multi‐objective genetic algorithm to maximize the volumetric energy dissipation such that the unit cell does not undergo plastic deformation. The finite element mesh used in this analysis is first parametrically optimized to minimize simulation time while remaining within a global error threshold. The optimal unit cell is arrayed into a bulk material, formed into a hollow cylinder, and simulated under a compression cycle for different metamaterial densities. A prototype of the hollow cylinder is 3D printed via fused deposition modeling and is tested. Both the simulated and experimental results demonstrate the repeatability of the energy‐dissipating property with a strong correlation.",

The numerical results reveal that the mechanical behavior concerning deflection and resonance frequency of FG‐GRPC plates can be significantly enhanced and modulated due to the influence of piezoelectricity and a small fraction of GPLs along with the consideration of poling angle in a multiscale fully integrated computational framework. The notions of on‐demand property modulation, actuation, and active control are established here by undertaking a comprehensive numerical analysis considering the coupled influences of poling orientations, different distributions, patterns, and weight fractions of GPLs along with different electromechanical loadings.

    "abstract": "Abstract A materials informatics framework to explore a large number of candidate van der Waals (vdW) materials is developed. In particular, in this study a large space of monolayer transition metal halides is investigated by combining high‐throughput density functional theory calculations and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their magnetic properties. The formation energy is used as a proxy for chemical stability. Semi‐supervised learning is harnessed to mitigate the challenges of sparsely labeled materials data in order to improve the performance of AI models. This approach creates avenues for the rapid discovery of chemically stable vdW magnets by leveraging the ability of AI to recognize patterns in data, to learn mathematical representations of materials from data and to predict materials properties. Using this approach, previously unexplored vdW magnetic materials with potential applications in data storage and spintronics are identified.",

Thionation, involving the replacement of diamide oxygens with sulfurs in NDI, significantly enhances quantum‐electronic/thermoelectric properties. Computational analyzes of energy of frontier orbitals HOMO/LUMO, dipole moment, polarizability, first superpolarizability, UV spectrum, and cohesive energy show the superior performance of the thione structure (M2) compared to the pristine structure (M1). Thionation decreased the energy gap from 01.3 eV (in M1 structure) to 1.87 eV (in M2 structure). The absorption wavelength in the pristine structure (M1) is calculated to be 507 nm, which increased to 1067 nm after thionation (M2). Cohesive energy values for each of M1 and M2 structures are calculated as 12.76 and 12.89 Kcal mol −1 , respectively, which indicates the improvement of stability after thionation. After connecting M1 and M2 to gold electrodes (Au‐M1‐Au and Au‐M2‐Au) and applying electric fields, the Au‐M2‐Au structure shows a lower energy gap, lower thermoelectric activity and higher conductivity at field intensities with higher than 140 × 10 −4 (a.u.), indicating its use as a field‐effect molecular device (such as molecular wire or molecular switch).",

The proposed design shows switching from an absorber to a reflector using the mechanical configuration of the functional material, and therefore the design can be used as a bi‐switchable device. The first type of switching is accomplished by changing the conductivity of the functional material, while the second type of switching is achieved with the help of the mechanical configuration of the functional material. Moreover, the structure is responsive to wide incident angles. The proposed switchable design has the potential to contribute to the development of tunable polarization rotating devices and on/off switching LPC devices, which have wide applications in detection, sensing, and communications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as promising candidates in PV research due to their exceptional photovoltaic properties. However, the toxicity and environmental concerns associated with lead‐based perovskites have led to the exploration of lead‐free alternatives. In this study, the performance of lead‐free bismuth PSCs, specifically PSCs based on Cesium Bismuth Iodide (Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 ) and Methyl Ammonium Bismuth Iodide (MA 3 Bi 2 I 9 ), is investigated. Numerical simulations using the solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) are conducted to comprehensively analyze the influence of key parameters, including the band‐to‐band radiative recombination rate, the absorber layer defect density, the absorber layer/electron transport layer (ETL) interface defect density, the absorber layer/hole transport layer interface (HTL) defect density, operating temperatures, and series and shunt resistances, and to optimize the proposed PSCs accordingly. The simulation results demonstrate a significant impact of these key parameters on the performance of Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 and MA 3 Bi 2 I 9 PSCs. The optimized Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 ‐based PSC exhibited notable performance characteristics, including a PCE of 13.81%, a V oc of 1.16 V, a J sc of 18.14 mA cm −2 , and FF of 65.51%. In contrast, the MA 3 Bi 2 I 9 ‐based PSC demonstrated relatively lower performance, with a PCE of 11.82%, V oc of 1.14 V, J sc of 18.06 mA cm −2 , and FF of 57.33%. The study on the defect density at the interfaces revealed the performance of PSCs is predominantly influenced by defects at the front interface (ETL/Absorber) rather than the rear interface (HTL/Absorber). These results provide valuable insights for the experimental design and optimization of lead‐free bismuth PSCs.",

In this article, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that using TiC MXene Ti n C n − 1 O 2 ( n = 2, 3, 4) as the cathode of lithium–air batteries (LABs) can potentially improve its efficiency by increasing the cathode conductivity and lowering the charging overpotential. In addition, the conservative predicted storage density is as high as ≈0.5 kWh kg −1 . Compared with the bulk TiC{111}, the favorable structural agreement between the TiC MXenes and Li 2 O 2 , and better interfacial conduction help Li 2 O 2 continuously grow on the TiC MXene; and the higher specific surface area (SSA) makes more Li 2 O 2 deposition possible. The predicted reaction path calculations reveal that TiC MXenes have the charging overpotential of 0.13 V because they are excellent catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, the lower charging overpotential can extremely suppress the side reactions and accelerate the OER rate. All the evidence supports that TiC MXene is a potential high energy density cathode for LABs.",

This is done by studying a model chaotic dynamical system with a single free parameter β, known as the generalized Bernoulli map, many of whose exact properties are known. Much of the structure of the dynamical system is lost in the floating‐point representation. For even integer values of the parameter, the long time behaviour is completely wrong, subsuming the known anomalous behaviour for β = 2. For non‐integer β, relative errors in observables can reach 14%. For odd integer values of β, floating‐point results are more accurate, but still produce relative errors two orders of magnitude larger than those attributable to roundoff. The analysis indicates that the pathology described, which cannot be mitigated by increasing the precision of the floating point numbers, is a representative example of a deeper problem in the computation of expectation values for chaotic systems. The findings sound a warning about the uncritical application of numerical methods in studies of the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems, such as are routinely performed throughout computational science, including turbulence and molecular dynamics.",

The objectives of this paper are twofold: (a) to improve the Voronoi grain‐based model (VGBM), and (b) to discuss several key challenges associated with model calibration. The EGBM is realized using the software Particle Flow Code (PFC) based on the principle of VGBM. To determine a representative EGBM, a simple calibration procedure taking the microcracking process into account is suggested. Using a crystalline rock as an example, three EGBMs with different rock structures as well as a conventional bonded‐particle model (BPM) have been examined to study the effect of geometric heterogeneity on physico‐mechanical behavior. The geometric heterogeneity of the three EGBMs is quantified by the geometric deviation index, which measures the standard deviation of fractal dimensions of the constitutive mineral grains. Simulation results suggest that: (1) BPM has very different microcracking mechanism from GBM owing to their different model formulations; (2) increasing irregularity of grain shape promotes the opening and sliding of grains along their boundaries; and (3) fracture complexity increases with increasing geometric heterogeneity.",

Understanding the effects of strain and electric field (E‐field) on 2D Ga 2 O 3 is helpful to explore the mechanism and potential application in the flexible device. Here, transport and optical properties of monolayer Ga 2 O 3 under uniaxial strain and E‐field are investigated. An indirect‐to‐direct band‐gap‐transition occurs under uniaxial tension due to the different variation of π bonding at the valence bands. The band‐gap exhibits a parabolic variation character from compression to tension, and relates to the direction of uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the transport characters are sensitive to the direction of uniaxial strain, and both compression and tension along b direction enhance the mobility of monolayer Ga 2 O 3 , which is inconsistent with that of electron effective mass. The mobility of tensile monolayer Ga 2 O 3 can be enlarged to 48368.14 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , different to that of 2D layered materials. Interestingly, the ultra‐visible absorption coefficients are just enhanced significantly by compression along c direction. Upon monolayer Ga 2 O 3 undergoes large E‐field (&gt;0.5 eV Å −1 ), the band‐gap and anisotropic transport property decreases and even vanishes.

Here, the electronic, electrochemical, mechanical properties, and structural morphology of MoS 2 @Ti 2 C and MoS 2 @Ti 2 CO 2 heterostructures as anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries are systematically investigated by taking advantages of van der Waals corrected spin‐polarized density functional theory to give atomistic insights. The results herein demonstrate that, for the MoS 2 @Ti 2 CO 2 heterostructure, MoS 2 polymorph drastically affects the electronic structure and lithium (Li) diffusion at the interface. Li diffusion barrier at the interface of dT‐MoS 2 @Ti 2 CO 2 along zigzag direction (0.15 eV) is much smaller than that of H‐MoS 2 @Ti 2 CO 2 (0.67 eV). For the MoS 2 @Ti 2 C heterostructure, however, the Li diffusion behavior and electronic structure are relatively insensitive to MoS 2 morphology. Especially, the MoS 2 @Ti 2 C heterostructures shows ultralow diffusion barrier, high charge–discharge rate, very low open‐circuit voltage (0.62–0.25 V), and high mechanical flexibility. These results suggest that MoS 2 @MXene heterostructures are promising anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries.",

Grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to calculate CO 2 and N 2 permeabilities of 7822 synthesized MOFs. This data are then combined with the experimentally reported gas permeability data of 14 different polymers using a theoretical permeation model. As a result, CO 2 permeabilities and CO 2 /N 2 selectivities of 109 508 different types of MOF‐based MMMs are estimated. The maximum CO 2 /N 2 selectivity and CO 2 permeability of MOF/polymer MMMs are computed as 64.3 and 36 103 Barrer, respectively. The top 50 MOFs that significantly improve CO 2 /N 2 separation performances of highly permeable polymers are identified and their potentials for separation of binary CO 2 /N 2 mixture are examined at practical operating conditions. Results show that several MOFs offer significant improvements both in the gas permeability and selectivity of polymers when used as fillers in MMMs for flue gas separation. The MOF structure–membrane performance relations are also investigated for MOF/polymer MMMs, and results show that MOFs with narrow pore sizes (3.75–5.12 Å), low surface areas (&lt;1000 m 2 g −1 ), and moderate porosities (0.41–0.58) lead to highly selective MMMs.",

Several hydrodynamic models, supplemented by additional boundary conditions, have been introduced in order to describe the collective motion of the free electron gas in metals. Four hydrodynamic models, namely the hard wall hydrodynamic model (HW‐HDM), the curl‐free hydrodynamic model, the shear forces hydrodynamic model, and the quantum hydrodynamic model (Q‐HDM), are thoroughly investigated. The investigation studies the mode structure (the natural modes or, in quantum optics, the quasi‐normal modes) of the spherical core–shell topology, which is complemented by the plane wave response from the system. The results of the above hydrodynamic models are also compared with those of the specular reflection method. It is demonstrated that the choice of a particular hydrodynamic model strongly affects the natural frequencies and modes in the mode structure of the topology and thus drastically modifies the simulated fields in the near and far regions. Contrary to HW‐HDM and Q‐HDM, the other two hydrodynamic models fail to predict the particles’ response accurately, showing artifactual mode hybridization.",

From a first screening based on intuitive criteria concerning metal sintering, CO poisoning, and O 2 adsorption strength, the Zn/Mo 2 CO 2 − δ system is selected for further scrutiny by means of reactivity calculations for different CO concentrations. A lower barrier is found for Eley–Rideal reaction mechanism than for the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. The low Eley–Rideal barrier (0.15 eV) is attributed to the fact that the Zn atom weakens the O‐O bond considerably and the electrophilic attack of CO weakens it further. The main conclusion is that this system is a promising low‐temperature SAC candidate with a lower energy barrier for CO oxidation than noble metal and other 2D SAC systems investigated.",

To address this problem, a novel fully atomistic non‐adiabatic molecular dynamics approach termed fragment orbital‐based surface hopping (FOB‐SH) that propagates the electron‐nuclear motion has been further improved and, for the first time, used to calculate the full 2D charge mobility tensor for the conductive planes of six structurally well characterized organic single crystals, in good agreement with available experimental data. The nature of the charge carrier in these materials is best described as a flickering polaron constantly changing shape and extensions under the influence of thermal disorder. Thermal intra‐band excitations from modestly delocalized band edge states (up to 5 nm or 10–20 molecules) to highly delocalized tail states (up to 10 nm or 40–60 molecules in the most conductive materials) give rise to short, ≈ 10 fs‐long bursts of the charge carrier wavefunction that drives the spatial displacement of the polaron, resulting in carrier diffusion and mobility. This study implies that key to the design of high‐mobility materials is a high density of strongly delocalized and thermally accessible tail states.",

It is crucial to develop a fast and efficient technology to first sort them and then extend their life while delivering energy, waste reduction, and economic benefits. In this work, a pulse clustering model embedded with improved bisecting K‐means algorithm is developed to effectively sort retired batteries with life cycles ranging from new to an end‐of‐life state. The relevance of selected variables is rigorously validated, reaching the accuracy as high as 88% compared with the traditional full charge–discharge test. To note, the test time has largely reduced from hours to minutes. This data‐driven clustering modeling with fast pulse test is a promising approach for clustering lithium‐ion batteries, which is demonstrated with a home‐built and high throughput intelligent clustering machine. In general, the technology opens a new generation of battery clustering, improving the efficiency and accuracy over the past semiempirical approaches.",

It is found that the porous graphdiyne‐based materials offer more space to accommodate lithium polysulfides with moderate adsorption energies and the anchoring performance changes with substrate and the size of Li2S n molecules: BGDY has a strong chemical interaction with lithium polysulfides due to the large charge transfer as compared to others. The chemical interaction dominates in anchoring species Li2S n with small size ( n = 1, 2), whereas vdW interaction dominates for S 8 and larger size Li2S n ( n = 6, 8) species. Furthermore, anchoring lithium polysulfides reduces the band gaps of the graphdiyne‐based materials and enhances the electronic conductivity. These intriguing features suggest that graphdiyne‐based porous 2D structures are promising anchoring materials for lithium–sulfur batteries.",

The results show that Cr@GY is an efficient NRR electrocatalyst which can activate the inert N≡N bond sufficiently. In particular, the enzymatic mechanism is considered as the most positive catalytic pathway with the limiting potential of −0.52 V. More importantly, Cr@GY can restrict a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electronic properties including Bader charge, the charge difference density (CDD), the partial density of states (PDOS) and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) have been analyzed in detail.

They can be efficiently parametrized using quantum mechanical calculations and subsequently sampled at a fraction of the cost of the underlying reference calculations. Here, force constant expansions are combined via the hiphive package with GPU‐accelerated molecular dynamics simulations via the GPUMD package to obtain an accurate, transferable, and efficient approach for sampling the dynamical properties of materials. The performance of this methodology is demonstrated by applying it both to materials with very low thermal conductivity (Ba 8 Ga 16 Ge 30 , SnSe) and a material with a relatively high lattice thermal conductivity (monolayer‐MoS 2 ). These cases cover both situations with weak (monolayer‐MoS 2 , SnSe) and strong (Ba 8 Ga 16 Ge 30 ) pho renormalization. The simulations also enable to access complementary information such as the spectral thermal conductivity, which allows to discriminate the contribution by different phonon modes while accounting for scattering to all orders. The software packages described here are made available to the scientific community as free and open‐source software in order to encourage the more widespread use of these techniques as well as their evolution through continuous and collaborative development.",

Most countries have adopted “lockdown” policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID‐19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Mathematical modeling in non‐pharmaceutical intervention policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID‐19 vaccine. A new hybrid model for COVID‐19 dynamics using both an age‐structured mathematical model based on the SIRD model and spatio‐temporal model in silico is presented, analyzing the data of COVID‐19 in Israel. Using the hybrid model, a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real‐time from the data of daily notification of cases is introduced. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over 2 weeks. The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of “Lockdown” policies. The unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day, and several physical locations, allow a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection.",

In the current study, a novel composite material that incorporates aligned graphene with localized origami shapes into the copper matrix is designed. Unlike many auxetic materials that have void phase, the proposed layer‐by‐layer assembled composite material appears to be solid in the microscopic scale. Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is observed that depending on the origami shapes, the in‐plane Poisson's ratio of origami graphene reinforced copper (100) composites can be tuned from positive to negative and, more importantly, it is discovered that the Young's modulus of the graphene/Cu composites can also be tuned from positive to negative in certain in‐plane directions.",

The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of airfoil thickness on the unsteady characteristics of high solidity VAWTs. Seven different national advisory committee for aeronautics (NACA) airfoils (0008, 0012, 0018, 0021, 0025, 0030, 0040) are investigated. A high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is used to examine the load and flow characteristics in detail. Before the study is undertaken, the CFD simulation is validated with experimental data as well as large eddy simulation results with sound agreement. The investigation demonstrates that increasing the airfoil thickness is actually beneficial not only for suppressing the dynamic stall effects but also to improve the performance of high solidity turbines. Interestingly this is accompanied by a slight reduction in thrust component. The strength and radius of the dynamic stall vortex decrease with increasing airfoil thickness. The airfoil thickness strongly influences the pressure distributions during dynamic stall process, which is driven by the suction peak near the leading edge. The knowledge gained might be used by blade engineers for designing future turbines and for improving the accuracy of engineering models.",

The IET rates are assessed for 18 Tb‐RP different compounds, each one with 44 IET pathways, also, it is obtained that the main energy transfer channel comes from the singlet state, in complete agreement with previous experimental data. The energy transfer from the singlet state is mainly composed of the nonradiative absorptions 7 F 6 → 5 G 6 and 7 F 5 → 5 G 5 , representing together 97% of the total IET rate.

Complicated topologies of the supercell are represented only with dozens of design variables based on material‐field series expansion model and can be optimized with a gradient‐free optimization algorithm. Different PnC resonant cavity configurations that are difficult to obtain through traditional design methods are realized through the proposed strategy.

The unit‐cell of the proposed MS is composed of the dielectric substrate sandwiched with the bilayered inner centrosymmetric‐notched‐elliptic (CNE), outer C‐shaped, and single‐split‐ring (SSR) structures. The proposed MS can convert the normal incident LP wave to its orthogonal one at the lower frequency ( f 1 = 0.68 THz) after transmission and left‐handed circular polarization to the transmitted right‐handed circular polarization wave or vice versa at the higher frequency ( f 2 = 1.34 THz). The full 2π phase shifts of the both transmitted LP and CP waves can be realized independently and simultaneously by varying the opening and orientation angles of the outer SSR structure based on the transmission phase and the orientation angle of the inner CNE structure based on geometric phase, respectively. As proofs of concept, anomalous refraction, planar focusing, and vortex beam generation for both LP and CP waves are demonstrated numerically. These findings show great potential applications in imaging and communication systems, providing new possibilities to develop multifunctional THz device for both LP and CP waves.",

Here, a proof‐of‐concept study is conducted using Bayesian optimization on CH 4 uptake capacity of hypothetical MOFs for an existing dataset (Wilmer et al., Nature Chem. 2012, 4 , 83). It is shown that less than 0.1% of the database needs to be screened with the Bayesian optimization approach to recover the top candidate MOFs. This opens the possibility for efficient screening of MOF databases using accurate ab initio calculations for future adsorption studies on a minimal subset of MOFs. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization and the surrogate model presented here can offer interpretable material design insights and the framework will be applicable in the context of other target properties.",

It also traces induced cascades of excitation of secondary particles, electrons and holes, and their energy exchange with atoms due to scattering. The excited atomic system is simulated with an MD model. We propose a simple and efficient way to account for nonthermal effects in the electron-atom energy transfer in covalent materials via conversion of potential energy of the ensemble into the kinetic energy of atoms, which can be straightforwardly implemented into an MD simulation. Such a combined MC-MD approach enables us time-resolved tracing of the excitation kinetics of both, electronic and atomic systems, and their simultaneous response to a deposited dose. As a proof-of-principle example, we show that proposed method describes atomic dynamics after X-ray irradiation in a good agreement with tight-binding MD, with much more affordable computational demands. The new model also allows us to gain insights into behavior of the atomic system during the energy deposition from a nonequilibrium electronic system excited by an ion impact.",

In this paper, the first‐principles calculations are performed to study the structural, elastic, and electronic properties of novel two‐dimensional (2D) Janus MSiGeN 4 monolayers (M = Ti, Zr, Hf). The calculations of phonon spectra indicate that monolayers MSiGeN 4 are dynamically stable and can be experimentally synthesized. The obtained Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the Janus structures MSiGeN 4 are much larger than that of other binary 2D materials and meet the mechanical stability criteria suggested by Born and Huang. In the calculations using either PBE or HSE06 functionals, the Janus MSiGeN 4 structures exhibit indirect semiconductor characteristics with larger band gaps than that of similar septuple‐atomic‐layer materials, such as MoSiGeN 4 and WSiGeN 4 . In addition, the influences of biaxial strain and external electric field on the electronic structure of MSiGeN 4 are investigated. It is found that the biaxial strain tunes the electronic characteristics more significantly than the external electric field.

It establishes SARIMA to predict the trend and seasonal series and extracts the linear information contained in the time series to the maximum extent. Then, the LSTM model is used to fit the residual series and the hidden nonlinear information is further extracted.

The optimal E G,PK is influenced primarily by the spectral distribution of incident irradiance, and not so much by the operating temperature conditions. Moreover, a clear linear dependency between the optimal E G,PK and the weighted average photon energy of the incident irradiance is demonstrated, which presents an important rule for rapid tandem design.",

Among the strategies employed to synthesize these nanostructures, surface functionalization and biomineralization of nanomaterials using peptides stand out due to the wide availability of peptides and their variations as well as the ease of modification process. Effective peptide‐based modification of nanomaterials relies on preferential and strong binding between peptides and target nanomaterials. Therefore, the discovery and design of specific peptides with high binding affinity to nanomaterials are essential. Unfortunately, conventional peptide screening methods suffer from shortcomings which render peptide discovery time‐consuming, expensive, and cumbersome. Herein, leveraging unsupervised and supervised machine learning, a framework to accelerate peptide analysis is presented. Specifically, more than 1700 nanoparticle‐binding peptides are classified into peptide clusters to identify important peptide features to realize higher‐affinity binding. In addition, the binding and biomineralization properties of peptides are predicted with high classification accuracy, precision, and recall. This work then proposes the use of unsupervised k‐means clustering and supervised k‐nearest neighbors algorithms for grouping peptides and predicting their properties, respectively. It is anticipated that the framework originated from this study will further facilitate the rational selection and design of peptides for engineering functional bioinspired and biomimetic nanostructures.",

The fire field is applied to keep the evacuees away from the fire. And game theory is adopted to solve the conflict in the choice of route for evacuees. With or without fire on the passenger ship, three different evacuees’ densities are used to study the influence of different proportions of evacuees who are familiar with exits during the evacuation time. The positions of exits are also studied. The results show that when the fire release rate increases from 3000 to 8000 kW s −2 for the same evacuation scenario, the earliest time that evacuees are in danger is 50% earlier. The impact of fire on evacuees is greater than that of evacuees’ density.

The results of low hole reorganization energy and the high total amount of charge transfer indicated that designed HTMs have effective hole transport ability. In the future, it is expected that this studies will demonstrate the potential of designed HTMs in the manufacture of effective PSCs in the solar industry.",

The new algorithms are based on the concept of multiple basin‐hopping walkers running in parallel, each with its own specialized task—the flying walker, exploring the energy landscape at high temperatures to sample different geometric structures, and the landing and hiking walkers mainly refining the optimization of chemical ordering at low temperatures. These algorithms are referred to as flying‐landing (FL) and flying‐landing‐hiking (FLH). The algorithms are tested against several benchmarks (AuCu and AuRh clusters of 400 atoms and PtNi clusters of 38 and 55 atoms). In all cases, both FL and FLH are shown to perform very well compared to previous results in the literature. In addition, the algorithms are applied to the optimization of larger AgCu nanoparticles, with sizes up to 4000 atoms, in order to establish the behavior of the mixing energy and to compare full global optimization of shape and chemical ordering with optimization of chemical ordering alone at a fixed shape. In general, the results show that the simultaneous optimization of shape and chemical ordering is necessary in many cases, and that the FLH approach is especially efficient for that purpose.",

The synthesis of these materials faces substantial experimental complexities, necessitating reliable performance predictions before fabrication. To address this, a comprehensive approach leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN), is developed. Integration of X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra data into AI models enables efficient prediction of photodetector efficiency prior to device fabrication. The innovation lies in strategically incorporating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for dataset augmentation, significantly expanding the dataset size and enhancing the robustness of the ANN model. Sensitivity analyses highlighted influential factors such as bias voltage and spectral coefficients, validating the approach and aligning with recent experimental findings. This methodology not only advances optoelectronics, but also holds promise for materials science and device engineering. Predictions for Wavelength‐Responsivity plots, considering borophene allotropes as active layers and n‐Si as substrates, show peaks around 300–400 nm, ranging from 0.04 to 0.36 AW −1 at bias voltages between 1 and 5 volts. These estimations assume a borophene layer thickness of approximately 1.6 nm and a radiation power intensity of 5000 µ Wcm −2 .",

However, lower photovoltaic efficiencies hinder their adoption due to limitations in designing small molecular electron donors (SMEDs) with optimal energy levels, light absorption, and optoelectronic properties. The present study addresses this gap by rationally designing a series of SMEDs ( DBT‐2FA1 to DBT‐2FA6 ) through terminal acceptors engineering into dibenzothiophene core with diphenylamine side donors for potential applications in ASM‐OSCs. Density functional theory simulations are carried‐out to establish structure‐property relationships based on structural, electrochemical, photophysical, and charge transfer (CT) properties. Results show that the SMEDs exhibit low‐lying HOMOs for suitable energy level alignment with benchmark Y6 acceptor, promoting open‐circuit voltage and charge separation. The panchromatic absorption spectra covering Vis‐NIR region and maximum light harvesting efficiency are beneficial for high current‐density in ASM‐OSCs. Notably, the push‐pull mechanism within SMEDs results in dominant intramolecular CT with above 70% CT excitations. Whereas, a moderate variation in dipole moments and electrostatic potential differences with acceptor material led to 99.9% intermolecular CT, thus ensuring robust exciton dissociation and efficient photocurrent generation. Overall, this work provides a molecular‐level understanding of designing novel SMEDs and their compatibility with acceptor materials for developing future high‐performance ASM‐OSCs.",

In this work, we utilize an attention mechanism to reconstruct the basic feature extraction module in the metal defect feature extraction network, aiming to enhance the focus on features related to small defects. Additionally, we redesign an efficient deconvolution module to extract multi‐scale defect feature information, capturing details of small defects at different scales. Finally, leveraging the idea of reparameterization to enhance feature representation capabilities, we optimize the output of the detection head, thereby strengthening the model's ability to capture features of small objects on the metal surface. On the NEU‐DET dataset, compared to the CenterNet baseline, the improved feature enhancement network shows a 4.9% improvement. Furthermore, with an accuracy of 80.2% compared to mainstream object detection methods, it outperforms other state‐of‐the‐art (SOTA) level object detection methods, significantly enhancing the detection accuracy and performance of the network model.",

Detailed analysis of photovoltaic parameters, such as open‐circuit voltage (V oc ), short‐circuit current density (J sc ), fill factor (FF), and overall PCE, underscores the superiority of CBTS as optimal BSF materials.

Non‐PEGylated GO showed strong gas‐phase binding (−103.36 kcal mol −1 ), supporting systemic stability, while PEGylation reduced aqueous‐phase binding (−33.72 kcal mol −1 ), enhancing biocompatibility and circulation. Adsorption energies were significant in acidic and alkaline environments, with PEGylation intensifying alkaline interactions (−118.42 kcal mol −1 ). Charge transfer dynamics, influenced by pH and PEGylation, revealed enhanced stability under acidic conditions, suitable for tumor microenvironments. Hydrogen bonding stabilized GO‐drug complexes, ensuring prolonged release. PEGylated GO excelled in acidic environments, especially for tumor delivery, as confirmed by miscibility studies and controlled release kinetics. Thermodynamic and quantum chemical analyses highlighted environmental factors and PEGylation in optimizing stability and reactivity.

Traditional drop weight shock testing methods, conforming to the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard of 1500 g for 0.5 ms half‐sine waveform, are often expensive, complex, and require delicate balancing. In this paper, a far simpler, two‐meter‐high, drop test facility is proposed for testing small‐sized portable electronics. The proposed equipment is easier to realize, conforms to the JEDEC standard, is easier to operate, offers a small turnaround time, and is economical. The novel design and the results of the shock test equipment are reported. A weight instrumented with high‐g accelerometers is dropped from a height of two meters inside a drop tube that is vertically straight and hits the aluminum base plate. The acceleration levels, ranging from 30,000 g for 100 µs to 1600 g for 1 ms, are achieved using the drop weight of 3 kg and pulse shaper of different thicknesses. The results are presented as a regression model, correlating peak acceleration and duration with pulse shaper thickness. The model accurately predicts the desired conditions for JEDEC testing and is validated under the standard conditions of 1500 g for 0.5 ms.

Transformation algorithms are required for processing but this raises computation costs because it is stored across all locations in the data warehouse and has redundancy issues. Therefore, Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is crucial to extract the data from various sources, transform it to meet analytical needs, and load it into a data warehouse. Hence, a novel Chimp‐based K‐means Tabu Warehouse System (CbKTWS) is proposed to handle large data in an ETL process based on cloud architecture. The key novelty of this work is managing the data resources in the data warehouse system with the help of chimp fitness. Moreover, the data is extracted using the chimp optimization's searching function and significant dimensional elimination of the information is executed by employing the habits created by a chimp optimizer during the transformation phase of the ETL process. Finally, the taboo search with the k‐means technique is used to create efficient data with a variety of nodes. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the suggested approach is assessed and contrasted with the earlier approaches using metrics like error, data accuracy, and processing time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates an epidemiological model of tuberculosis dynamics by classifying the total population into five distinct compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, treated, and recovered. To solve the system of nonlinear differential equations and obtain approximate solutions for the tuberculosis model, three analytical methods are utilized: the transcendental‐exponential type proposed method (PNM), the Homotopy perturbation method (HPM), and the higher‐order inverse polynomial method (HOIPM). Additionally, the study examines the stochastic performance of artificial neural networks trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (ANNs‐LMB) to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the tuberculosis model. The predictions generated by ANNs‐LMB provide valuable benefits for researchers, significantly improving their understanding of infectious tuberculosis dynamics. Furthermore, error estimations demonstrate that the PNM, HOIPM, and ANNs‐LMB methods are highly effective in generating accurate solutions, closely matching those obtained from the Runge–Kutta solver, and surpassing the performance of HPM. These methods exhibit strong reliability and efficiency, making them innovative tools for addressing tuberculosis models and simulating epidemiological challenges. Moreover, the analysis of key parameters, including contact rate, infection rate, tuberculosis‐related mortality rate, reinfection rate, and treatment rate, provides crucial insights into the model's behavior and dynamics, paving the way for future research and effective intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are pivotal in enhancing the electroluminescence efficiency of organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) by enabling effective utilization of triplet excitons. Emitters based on naphthalimide (NI) have not received much attention, particularly the C3 substituted variants. In this study, a potential TADF molecule NI‐AZB featuring 10‐mesityl‐5,10‐dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azaborinine (AZB) as a donor is shortlisted after a rigorous consideration of several similar derivatives possessing donors such as carbazole, dimethylacridine, phenoxazine, and phenothiazine. Computational analyses indicate that NI‐AZB exhibits a small singlet‐triplet energy gap, promising radiative decay rates, moderate spin‐orbit coupling, and substantial reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) rates. The S 1 state of NI‐AZB is charge‐transfer (CT) in nature, while the T 1 state exhibits localized excitation (LE), facilitating enhanced spin‐orbit coupling and rISC rates. Additionally, NI‐AZB absorbs in the UV region, suggesting its potential as a blue‐emitting material for OLED devices. Furthermore, it is observed that substitution at the C4 of the naphthalimide core enhances CT character, leading to higher rISC rates but reduced radiative rates. Conversely, substitution at the C3 diminishes CT character, resulting in increased radiative rates while maintaining moderate rISC rates. These insights underscore the importance of C3 substitution in optimizing TADF properties of naphthalimide‐based emitters for OLED applications.",

However, the underlying geometric principles shaping these patterns remain unclear. In this study, the geometric and statistical properties of grain structures are investigated. Grain shapes are characterized by using equivalent radius and shape parameters such as circularity, aspect ratio, convexity, and solidity. These shape parameters with those of Voronoi diagrams generated from various models are compared, including correlated and uncorrelated center distributions. These findings reveal that the statistical properties, including means and standard deviation of the shape parameters, align closely with Voronoi diagrams based on random close packing of circle centers. This suggests that such Voronoi diagrams provide an accurate mathematical model for describing perovskite thin‐film morphology. Furthermore, by integrating the correlated center distribution and Voronoi framework with the Avrami–Johnson–Mehl method, a model is proposed for nucleation, grain growth, and morphology evolution in perovskite thin films. This work offers a foundational perspective for understanding the film formation mechanisms of perovskite thin films, paving the way for enhanced control over their microstructures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data‐driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real‐world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, a novel multi‐modal foundation model, named FMint ( F oundation M odel based on In i t ialization) is proposed, to bridge the gap between human‐designed and data‐driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder‐only transformer architecture with in‐context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre‐trained on a corpus of 400K ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and extensive experiments are performed on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general‐purpose solver for dynamical systems. This approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state‐of‐the‐art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms.

However, the majority of existing PnC resonators are typically designed and manufactured for fixed frequencies and limited functionalities. Once these resonators are manufactured, achieving tunable characteristics becomes challenging. To address the challenge, this study presents a topology optimization strategy based on an efficient point defect diagonally movement reconstruction mechanism. For achieving the broadest tunable range for various resonators, the proposed strategy involves the use of gradient‐free topology optimization algorithm to successively design surrounding unit cells and point defects of the resonator, leading to the successful realization of tunable resonators with customized functions. Optimization results from several examples demonstrate a tunable defect‐band frequency range that covers almost the entire bandgap. Furthermore, this study explores the relationship between the resonant frequency and the diagonal moving distance of reconstruction mechanism. Both numerical simulations and experimental tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design strategy in creating PnC resonators with wide‐frequency tunable characteristics.

In this paper, a method for simulating the distribution of the Maxwell‐Boltzmann distribution with MCMC approach by truncated Rayleigh distribution is presented and generated a random sample from this distribution by rejection sampling method. Some statistical inference properties for the parameter of the Maxwell‐Boltzmann distribution such as maximum likelihood estimator, method of moments estimator, uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator and minimum risk equivariant estimator, and the relationship between maximum likelihood estimator, uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator, and also minimum risk equivariant estimator are found. Also, the hypothesis testing is discussed and the uniform most powerful test, generalized likelihood ratio test, uniformly most powerful unbiased test and uniformly most powerful invariant test and also confidence interval with equal tails, the shortest confidence interval, unbiased confidence interval and asymptotic confidence interval for the parameter of the Maxwell‐Boltzmann model are found. By the way, a new method based on stochastic methods for finding the shortest and the unbiased confidence interval for the parameter of the Maxwell‐Boltzmann model is introduced and it is shown that with a very close approximation, it leads to the same results of previous researches that are solved by numerical methods. It is proved that the Kullback‐Leibler divergence between two Maxwell‐Boltzmann distributions with different parameters is a convex function of the ratio of the parameters and then, the Hellinger distance between these two distributions is also calculated. By selecting the multiplicative group action, the discussion of invariance is followed and maximal invariant statistics and weakly equivariant estimators are found. Next, the uniformly most powerful invariant test critical region is performed using bootstrap. In the end, using two real data series, the statistical inferences expressed in the paper are analyzed.

While advancements in automated insulin delivery systems, such as insulin pumps, have improved glucose management, these devices still rely on patient input. This leads to non‐optimal management of glucose levels and increases the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. In contrast to traditional electronic sensors, chemo‐fluidic oscillators directly link chemical signals with fluidic control, offering a more integrated and responsive approach to diabetes management. The model describes the dynamics of a stimuli‐responsive hydrogel and its chemical transport behavior, enabling the automated release of insulin into the bloodstream without the need for patient intervention. The study compares various numerical methods, evaluating their stability and accuracy, both crucial for reliable results of the dynamic behavior of the oscillator. Stability prevents divergent results, while accuracy is vital to avoid errors that can lead to unsafe insulin dosing. Results indicate that the model is robust, making it well‐suited for advanced biomedical applications",

This approach integrates the Transfer Matrix Method with artificial intelligence to streamline design processes by addressing the dual challenge of achieving high visible light transparency and efficient photovoltaic performance.

Nonetheless, the majority of two dimensional (2D) materials exhibit an absence of ferroelectric properties owing to their elevated symmetry, which presents obstacles for their utilization in photocatalysis. This study presents two novel strategies for inducing ferroelectricity in 2D materials: intralayer polarization, accomplished by substituting phosphorus atoms in black phosphorus (BP) with elements like nitrogen (N), arsenic (As), or antimony (Sb); and interlayer polarization, realized through a controlled heterostructure design. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that these tailored materials demonstrate markedly diminished overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), with values as low as 1.04 and 1.12 eV, respectively. The materials exhibit competitive Gibbs free energy profiles for the hydrogen evolution process (HER), highlighting their adaptability.

The focused objective function is comprised of a combination of two different fitness functions. Optimization of charging current is made dynamically following a battery's temperature. These experimental findings validate the proposed charging strategy's effectiveness in delivering the optimal current profile. This approach demonstrably achieves a well‐calibrated balance between competing performance objectives.

A comprehensive 3D simulation framework is developed to analyze the impact of key parameters diffusion coefficient ( D ), chemoattractant release rate ( Q ), receiver (RX) speed ( u ), and initial transmitter‐receiver distance ( d ) on communication performance. Results indicate that lower D values enhance the formation of chemoattractant gradients, leading to improved signal clarity and efficiency. Conversely, higher RX speeds distort these gradients, increasing signal reach time and reducing success rates. Elevated Q values significantly broaden the sensing range and improve reliability, particularly over larger distances, though their effect is diminished at high RX speeds. Notably, success rates drop sharply as d approaches the theoretical sensing threshold, underscoring the critical need for parameter tuning. Experimental results validate these findings and reveal a threshold beyond which bacterial movement becomes random, limiting effective signal transmission. These insights contribute to optimizing BBMC systems for greater efficiency and reliability. Applications include targeted drug delivery, environmental biosensing, and synthetic biology, where precise bacterial signaling is essential.

The Tin di‐selenide (SnSe 2 ) with high refractive index (RI) and excellent absorption property in visible and infrared regions allows efficient interaction with the evanescent field, thereby increasing sensitivity for small RI changes near the surface. The strategic integration of lead titanate (PbTiO 3 ), known for its high RI and tunable bandgap, with SnSe 2 and Silicon (Si) layers, the proposed sensor design (FK51A‐prism/Ag/SnSe 2 /Si/PbTiO 3 /Sensing‐Medium) significantly improves sensitivity to 390.41°/RIU for the ring stage of malaria. The Kretschmann configuration, in conjunction with the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) and angular interrogation, has been utilized to optimize the performance of the proposed SPR sensor. The proposed design achieves an optimal Quality Factor (QF) of 130.92 RIU⁻¹, enabling the detection of small changes in RI. With a Detection Accuracy (DA) of 0.33 deg −1 for the ring stage, the proposed SPR sensor demonstrates its potential for early and accurate malaria diagnosis. Also, the enhanced DA and QF in later stages (trophozoite and schizont stages) offers broad detection range of the proposed SPR design.

The MHETM model has higher accuracy and can more accurately describe the lithium ion transport process inside the active particles. The results show that the gradient porosity design optimizes the lithium ion diffusion path and improves the diffusion rate and end‐of‐discharge concentration.

In addition, the thermal‐mechanical coupling analysis revealed the negative correlation between thermal stress and thermal expansion. The introduction of the macro‐thermal model further facilitates the lithium ion transport, resulting in an increase in the concentration maxima of both the U1 and G3 models, with a more significant increase in the G3 model.

However, applications for such structures are often hindered by the significant intrinsic loss when it comes to optical frequencies. Here, several configurations of all‐dielectric metasurfaces, in which the meta‐molecules are composed of disk oligomers (trimer, quadrumer, pentamer, and hexamer), are proposed to support toroidal dipole resonances in the near‐infrared waveband when the polarization of the normally incident excitation plane wave is directed to one of the symmetry axes of the oligomers. Multipole expansion including the toroidal dipole term along with near‐field electromagnetic patterns confirms the existence of strong toroidal dipolar responses within certain wavelength ranges.

An appropriate side chain appended to the nitrogen atoms is often crucial to constrain the peptoids into well‐defined and active rigid structures for applications. To shed light on the secondary structure of peptoids, accurate methods for structural characterization are mandatory and typically involve the association of circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Molecular simulations can also prove highly complementary to rationalize the relationship between their primary and secondary structures, although much less studies have been reported to date compared to the knowledge accumulated on peptides. To this end, the PEPDROID force field has been developed based on the DREIDING force field, by incorporating a new set of parameters relative to (α and β) peptoids bearing different side chains. The ability of PEPDROID to assess the secondary structure of peptoids by generating Ramachandran‐like plots matching those previously obtained at a quantum‐chemical level for model systems has been demonstrated. For further sake of validation, it is demonstrated that PEPDROID can reproduce the experimental structures of either α‐ or β‐ peptoids .",

However, the understanding of the atomistic process occurring at the sliding friction interfaces, especially the interfacial structure transformation and lubricant dissociation at different contact states, is still not well understood. Here, using reactive molecular dynamics simulation, the friction behavior of a self‐mated a‐C system composited with different alpha olefins (AOs) as lubricants is comparatively investigated, and the results present that due to the co‐existence of tribo‐induced thermal and shearing effects, AOs exhibit different physicochemical behaviors at the a‐C–a‐C interface compared to that at the a‐C surface. Although introducing AOs into a self‐mated a‐C system reduces the friction coefficient, its efficiency strongly relies on the AO variety and contact pressure. The pressure‐driven dissociation of AOs passivates the friction interface, resulting in the evolution of the primary friction mechanism from hydrodynamic lubrication to interfacial passivation that is not accessible by experimental characterization. The corresponding scission sites of different AOs are demonstrated, which enriches the fundamental understanding on sliding friction behavior and offers a comprehensive design criterion for lubricants (viscosity, chain length, and bond saturated states) and a‐C to achieve nearly frictionless sliding interface.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The solid–solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and Li metal anode is one of the major challenges for garnet's application in all‐solid‐state batteries. The areal specific resistance (ASR) is investigated by ab initio calculations in this article, to predict the intrinsic ASR as lower limitation. The Li ion migration across the interphase is divided into two steps: 1) Li \"intercalation\" from Li‐metal to the LLZO, forming a Li‐rich interphase beneath the surface of LLZO, and 2) Li migration in the Li‐rich interphase within LLZO. The first step is investigated by climbing image nudged elastic band (CI‐NEB), resulting in barrier energy lower than 0.37 eV compared to experimental 0.34 eV of the garnet bulk phase. The second step is investigated by ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD), indicating that the Li‐rich interphase's conductivity is lower by about 1–2 orders of magnitude compared to the bulk phase. As a result, the sum theoretical intrinsic ASR is as low as 0.01 Ω cm 2 , suggesting high ASR in practicable battery arises from surficial impurity Li 2 CO 3 rather than intrinsic ionic resistance. However, difficulties of removing Li 2 CO 3 lie in that Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 can thermodynamically decompose into reactive Li 2 O to form high resistant Li 2 CO 3 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Airy beam has attracted considerable interests due to its remarkable non‐diffracting, self‐bending, and self‐healing properties. An auto‐focusing Airy (AFA) beam can be achieved by constructing two counter‐propagation Airy beams, which is a novel method to generate focusing effect. Traditionally, because of the complexity of the generation mechanism, it is hard to realize the Airy beam with complex amplitude modulation. The reported ones usually require bulky optical systems and typically work at one single wavelength. Here, a general scheme is proposed to launch dual‐band Airy and AFA beams based on the single‐layer geometric metasurface, consisting of a newly designed meta‐atom that can realize independent complex amplitude modulations at two arbitrary terahertz wavelengths. Based on the proposed meta‐atom, the aforementioned attractive properties of the Airy beam are demonstrated at two terahertz wavelengths. Besides, the dual‐band AFA beams are illustrated to have the practically important adjustability of the focal length. Furthermore, owing to the self‐healing property, the proposed focusing scheme (i.e., AFA beam) shows a much better capability of circumventing the PEC obstacles compared to the conventional metalens, which could have potential applications in various important scenarios such as biomedical imaging/therapy and nondestructive evaluation with compact size and multiwavelength functionalities.",

However, recent studies indicate that TADF compounds such as the oBFCzTrz emitter (5‐(2‐(4,6‐diphenyl‐1,3,5‐triazin‐2‐yl)phenyl)‐5H‐benzofuro[3,2‐c]carbazole) display insignificant concentration quenching dependence. To understand the origin of this beneficial behavior, the morphology, dynamics, electronic properties, and charge transport and energy transfer in a neat film of the oBFCzTrz emitter are characterized via molecular dynamic simulations combined with density functional theory calculations. The emissive layer shows glassy behavior at room temperature with the twisted configurations of the emitter molecules allowing for intramolecular donor–acceptor interactions, but disfavoring intermolecular π–π stacking, which suppresses the formation of intermolecular aggregate states. As a result, the electronic structure and luminescence of oBFCzTrz are not significantly altered by intermolecular interactions. The calculated diffusion lengths of the singlet and triplet excitons are small enough that there occurs no substantial concentration quenching effect. Overall, the design of new TADF emitters with structural motifs similar to those of oBFCzTrz offers potential to develop efficient organic light‐emitting diode devices in which the emissive layers are entirely composed of TADF molecules without the need for a host component.",

High‐performance few‐layer Bi 2 O 2 Se FETs have been realized due to the existence of ohmic contact between few‐layer Bi 2 O 2 Se and the metal electrodes. However, monolayer (ML) Bi 2 O 2 Se FET exhibits poor device performance owing to lack of good contact between ML Bi 2 O 2 Se and the metal electrode. This work simulates the ML Bi 2 O 2 Se Schottky barrier field‐effect transistors with a sequence of common electrodes (Au, Pd, Pt, Ag, Sc, and Ti) for the first time by using ab initio quantum transport simulations. For Ag, Au, and Pd electrodes, a lateral n ‐type Schottky contact is formed with similar Schottky barrier heights of 0.43–0.52 eV due to a strong usual Fermi‐level pinning (FLP) to the band gap of ML Bi 2 O 2 Se. Remarkably, Pt, Sc, and Ti electrodes lead to a desirable lateral n ‐type ohmic contact because of an unusual FLP above the ML Bi 2 O 2 Se conduction band as a result of electrode work function modification at the interface. Therefore, high performance is anticipated for ML Bi 2 O 2 Se devices with these low‐resistance ohmic contacts.",

The scattering patterns of the SACPGM can be synthetically manipulated by the reflection of the spin‐selectivity absorbing unit cells, the phase gradient of the coding elements, and the coding sequences. As an example, a two‐bit SACPGM with random coding sequence is designed to reduce radar cross section (RCS) by a combination of absorption, beam deflection, surface wave coupling, and diffusion scattering. Both simulated and measured results agree well and demonstrate that the SACPGMs possess excellent performance for RCS reduction.

Therefore, it is crucial to study polarons in transition metal oxides and semiconductors using first‐principles methods to elucidate the nature of charge carriers and trapping sites for ameliorating the performance of energy conversion.

Thus, under varying operating circumstances, the PEMFCs have gained considerable importance as an alternative energy source. The optimal operation of PEMFC needs to be ensured to exploit its advantages to the maximum limit. In this direction, there is an extensive need for parameter extraction of PEMFC. Many researchers have applied evolutionary optimization approaches to estimate the PEMFCs parameters as the precise modeling of these cells are not possible. To optimize unknown parameters of PEMFCs, a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed, that is, chaotic mayfly algorithm (CMA) is being proposed in this manuscript. The model's statistical effects are more aligned with the actual experimental findings, according to an experimental finding. The results so obtained suggest that CMA variants are a valuable and efficient method of estimating the parameters of PEMFCs models. Even the nonparametric tests like the Friedman ranking test, Wilcoxon's rank‐sum test, and Mood's median test suggest that the proposed algorithm shows better accuracy of the extracted parameters as compared to the other algorithms namely considered in this work.",

The power conversion efficiency of Cs 2 InBiBr 6 ‐based perovskite solar cells is not reported yet.

All non‐symmetry related isomers are modeled. Although carbon doping reduces the cohesive energy of the BNFs, most of them remain stable. It is found that the location of carbon atoms in the lowest‐energy isomers follows a definite sequence as the doping level increases. The results indicate that substitutional carbon lowers the gap energy and chemical hardness of BNFs, but it increases their electronegativity and electrophilicity index. Particularly, carbon doping makes BNFs more susceptible to nucleophilic attacks. Additionally, the charge redistribution and structural asymmetry generated by carbon doping endows BNFs with polar character. A dipole alignment parameter is introduced to elucidate some correlation between the atomic arrangement and the polarity of the systems. While carbon doping enhances the capability of BNFs to interact with other chemical species, possible toxicity concerns are highlighted. Finally, possible fingerprints to identify successful carbon doping through infrared and UV–vis spectroscopy are proposed.",

The quality of the Drude FF, however, has remained largely untested for modeling the secondary structures of small peptides in explicit solvents compared with classical non‐polarizable FFs. It is critical to benchmark the complex and mutually dependent dynamics of hydrogen‐bond (H‐bond) networks formed by water–water, protein–water, and protein–protein interactions that are expected to have a major impact on the stability of protein structures and their conformational space. Here, a direct comparison is presented between the current Drude FF and the CHARMM‐36 non‐polarizable classical FF for 1) the solvation free energy of mimetics for all amino acid side‐chain equivalents, 2) limited conformational space, 3) protein–water and protein–protein interactions, and 4) the comparative lifetimes of H‐bonds.

In contrast, a sharp dependence of the BO on interface specifics has been observed at heterovalent heterojunctions. Here, detailed analyses of the relationship between the BO, interface structure, and charge distribution have been carried out for many lattice‐matched heterovalent interfaces between zincblende and diamond structure semiconductors. From thermodynamic considerations, three types of neutral interfaces were investigated, each with equal densities of donor‐ and acceptor‐like heterovalent bonds, constructible in all orientations. Distinctively different, yet approximately orientation‐independent, valence BOs were found. The equilibrium charge density of the heterovalent interface could be recreated with the charge densities of bulk semiconductors and oligo‐cells. Because charge transfer between heterovalent bonds is identifiable with that for dopants in semiconductor and its effect accountable by linear response, a combination of neutral polyhedra theory, previously developed for isovalent heterojunctions, and dielectric screening theory was found to explain BO trends throughout, allowing a strategy that facilitates adjustment in the BO of all isovalent heterojunctions.",

Design of heterojunctions is difficult due to the limited number of materials for which band alignment is known, and the experimental and computational difficulties associated with obtaining this data. Band alignment based on branch‐point energies ( E BP ) is shown to be a good and efficient approximation that can be obtained using data from existing electronic‐structure databases. Errors associated with this approach are comparable to those of expensive first‐principles computational techniques and experiments. E BP alignment is then incorporated into a framework capable of rapidly screening existing online databases to design semiconductor heterojunctions. The method is showcased for five different prototype cases: Transport layers are successfully predicted for CdSe‐ and InP‐based LEDs, and for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ‐ and nanoparticle PbS‐based solar absorbers. In addition, Cu 2 O as a possible hole‐transport layer for solar cells is examined. The framework addresses the challenge of accomplishing fast materials selection for heterostructure design by tying together first‐principles calculations and existing online materials databases.",

The phase transition in barium titanate is generally considered to exhibit order–disorder character, suggesting the potential for thermal conductivity switching if this order–disorder transition can be controlled. To investigate this possibility computationally, following the method of Fu and Bellaiche, here electric fields are applied to align the polarizations and transform disordered paraelectric structures to ordered ferroelectric structures. Solving the Boltzmann transport equation, the theoretical limit of a perfectly disordered structure is found to have thermal conductivity of a factor of 3.9 lower than the perfectly ordered structure. The thermal conductivity of the ordered structure can be further enhanced by up to another 2.4 times under electric fields due to the reduction in phonon scattering rates, implying a theoretical maximum thermal conductivity switching ratio of 9.4. This study yields two guidelines in searching for high thermal conductivity switch ratio in ferroelectric materials: the structure should be single domain under electric field and the phase transition should be fully order–disorder rather than displacive.",

The thickness‐dependent dielectric breakdown strength is well simulated through this phase‐field model. It is found that the dielectric breakdown strength and the patterns of final breakdown path is significantly influenced by the defect concentration and applied stress. An enhanced breakdown strength of MLCC is proved under either compressive or shear stress state.

Chains containing a number of carbon atoms of a certain parity possess singlet ground states, while members of opposite parity have triplet ground states. From a general perspective, it is important that this even-odd effect confounds straightforward chemical intuition. Whether the most stable form is a triplet or a singlet is neither simply related to the fact that the species in question is a normal (closed-shell, nonradical) molecule nor a (di)radical or to the (e.g., cumulene-type) C-C bond succession across the chain. From a computational perspective, the present results are important also because they demonstrate that electron correlations in carbon-based chains are extremely strong. Whether the gold-standard CCSD(T) (coupled-cluster expansions with single and double excitations and triple excitations corrections) framework suffices to describe such strongly correlated systems remains an open question that calls for further clarification. Most importantly for astrochemistry, the present results may explain why certain members are not astronomically observed although larger members of the same homologous series are detected; the missing species are exactly those for which the present calculations predict triplet ground states.",

More specifically, in situ micromechanical testing of notched nano‐cantilever beams has been carried out in a transmission electron microscope. The material characteristic length and fracture toughness are then evaluated. The average K IC value obtained is 0.98 MPa m 0.5 , which is in agreement with that reported in the literature for macro‐Si. The characteristic length L is in the range of 1.3–1.9 nm.

Calculation results show that, unlike Pd monomer, Pd dimer can provide the multiple adsorption sites for activation and adsorption of methane and oxygen, which is beneficial for the direct process of methane to methanol. Notably, the proton transfer pathway of undissociated oxygen with rate‐determining step of C–H bond dissociation can easily occur on Pd 2 /Mo 2 CO 2 .

However, the relationship between the morphology of the woodpecker head and its mechanical function against damage from daily pecking habits remains an open question. Aided by recent technical advancements, these questions can be explored by applying new materials science concepts of bioinspiration and bioexploration to identify adapted structures/materials in a design that results from millions of years of evolution. Two main features, including the beam‐like bar structure of the jugal bone acting as a main stress deflector and the high natural frequency of the skull bone of woodpeckers can teach two lessons for potential materials development as well as engineering applications: protection of a delicate internal organ occurs by redirection of the main stress pathway and a large mismatch of the natural frequencies between the skull and brain avoids resonance and reduces the overall load experienced by the brain.",

The finite element method (FEM) is employed to create a database of effective thermal conductivity of hypothetical Al alloys with varying precipitate morphological and thermal transport features. Using the FEM‐generated data sets, the correlation analysis is conducted to qualitatively evaluate the importance of various precipitate features. The correlation analysis identifies the surface area, average diameter, and volume fraction of precipitates as the most descriptive features for determining the thermal conductivity of alloys. Afterward machine learning (ML) models are trained to accurately predict the effective thermal conductivity. Comparing the ML predictions with effective thermal conductivity and microstructural information from experiments, precipitate thermal transport properties can be calculated, such as interfacial conductance between Al matrix and precipitate, without atomistic simulations.

However, most of the investigation is on the macroscopic device electrical properties such as current–voltage curves. Investigation on the microscopic electrical properties including potential distribution, electrolyte salt concentration distribution, and lithium ion concentration distribution within the batteries during the discharging is still needed. Here, a detailed study of the key electrical properties distributions inside the lithium battery in the discharging status is given. After comparing three widely used cathode materials (LiCoO 2 , LiMn 2 O 4 , and LiFePO 4 ), LiFePO 4 is found to show the most stable working performance which is consistent with previous reports. This is probably attributed to its most uniform key electrical properties distributions, its high electric conductivity, and crystal structure. A structure is also proposed which might give a hint to stress and temperature release for a longer and safer application of batteries. This simulation study on the key parameters distribution inside the battery may help to achieve a better understanding and hence control on the lithium battery performance and reliability.",

Typically, this SALR model system is used to represent solutions where at least one of the solute species interacts via a screened‐Coulomb potential, which includes many colloidal, nanoparticle, and polyelectrolyte solutions among others. Provided neither the short‐range nor long‐range interactions are too strong, and the concentration remains sufficiently low, discrete spherical clusters of solute are expected, here called “Giant SALR clusters.” Because these clusters can themselves be disordered, as though fluid particles with a renormalized interaction, such cluster fluids cannot be treated using standard mean field methods. This review therefore focuses on theoretical routes that aim to overcome this difficulty. The main outcomes of these theories are highlighted and their application to soft matter and especially biology, including complex coacervates, membraneless organelles, and the origin of life is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, how to fully manipulate the polarization state of linearly polarized (LP) light has become an emerging research hotspot in the region of photonics. Here, a novel alternative approach based on all‐dielectric metasurfaces to realize and control the polarization state of light with broadband and high transmission is theoretically and numerically investigated. In contrast with the polarization rotation mechanism of non‐chiral metasurfaces, the proposed configuration can be illustrated by the Jones matrix in a theoretical analysis. The proposed design is based on multi‐conversion of the incident linearly polarized light in a double‐layer quarter‐wave plate structure. Through an elaborate design of the structural units, a one‐layer quarter‐wave plate structure can convert a linearly polarized light to a circularly polarized state. An arbitrary polarization rotation with high efficiency (&gt;88%) and broadband (approximately equal to the bandwidth of quarter‐wave plate) can be achieved through the collective effect of the two quarter‐wave plates. The proposed approach based on all‐dielectric metasurfaces exhibits the capacity of arbitrarily manipulating the polarization states, which can facilitate future applications in photonics.",

Methods are available that allow testing a single specimen and then transform the storage modulus data to recover elastic modulus. However, applying these methods to polymers with more than one thermal transitions is challenging. As the form of artificial neural network (ANN) follows the time–temperature superposition principle, it is used in the present work to establish the master relation for storage modulus. The neural network is built with various neuron numbers and regularization factors, and two magnitudes of Gaussian noises. The predictions achieve the best accuracy when the regularization factor equals 10 −4 and neuron number equals the number of thermal transitions in the material. Then the ANN is trained on storage modulus data of graphene‐epoxy nanocomposites and achieves 4.1% average error. The storage modulus is transformed to time domain relaxation function using integral relation of viscoelasticity. Stress response over the strain history is determined and the elastic modulus is extracted. Compared to the tensile test results, the predictions achieve an average error of 0.7%, which indicates that the method can predict the material behavior over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates.",

The set of calculated mechanical properties include the bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives, the Young and shear moduli, the Poisson's Ratio and the ductility, hardness, and anisotropy indices. Silver oxalate is a highly anisotropic brittle material possessing a small bulk modulus of ≈9.6 GPa. It displays the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) phenomenon, the value of the lowest NPR having a very large magnitude, −1.27. Besides, it exhibits the most extreme form of the negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomenon found to date. Silver oxalate displays anisotropic NLC for external pressures in the range −0.1 to −2.4 GPa directed along the [010] crystallographic direction and isotropic NLC for isotropic pressures in the range −0.51 to 13.4 GPa. The lowest value of the negative compressibility, −831.9 ± 10 TPa −1 , is found for an isotropic pressure of −0.16 GPa. The absolute value of the computed lowest NLC is extremely large, about three times larger than the absolute value of the lowest NLC found so far. The NLC pressure range is also very wide, its width being more than two times the largest range found to date.",

Though the development of a comprehensive atomistic model is key to go deeper into the understanding of this phenomenon, existing models have failed to reproduce the abrupt dependence of the dissolution rate with the Gibbs free energy (). Herein, a new atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model is presented, which, invoking the microscopic reversibility of chemical reactions, captures the experimentally observed sigmoid dependence of the dissolution rate and provides new insights on the concomitant dissolution mechanisms. As a salient result, the model predicts the possible existence of unreported close‐to‐equilibrium dissolution modes where spontaneous vacancies creation and pit opening can occur before adatom and terrace removal.",

With a small footprint area at f = 5.8 GHz, the proposed circularly polarized coding metasurface antenna (CPCMA) consists of several radiating meta‐atoms with 2‐bit excitation phases of 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2. Compared with conventional antenna arrays, the center‐to‐center distance of the coding elements is noticeably reduced, where periodic boundary conditions have been employed to analyze the inter‐element coupling effects. A low‐cost and simple corporate feed network is also designed to implement the required coding mask of each CPCMA type. To verify the performance of the proposed CPCMA, a prototype is fabricated and measured. Proof‐of‐concept experiments demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical simulations and theoretical predictions. This constructs a bridge between conventional arrays and digital metasurfaces, providing a powerful host for the next generation of multi‐beam circularly polarized radiators.",

Over the last decade, spatial multiplexing based on the orbital angular momentum (OAM) by adopting a multi‐mode OAM metasurface has attracted a lot of attention. However, current metasurface‐based OAM multiplexing methods suffer from complex and limited multiplexing channels. In this paper, a novel method to realize multi‐dimensional multiplexing combining OAM and frequency based on an angle‐multiplexed metasurface over a broadband terahertz region is proposed and investigated. A frequency‐independent phase profile formula of the angle‐multiplexed metasurface is derived. A reflective metasurface operating from 0.25 to 0.35 terahertz (THz) is designed based on this formula. For proof of concept, nine‐channel multiplexing is illustrated based on this novel method. The simulation results verify that nine‐channel off‐axis left‐hand circularly polarized beams are converted to nine orthogonal coaxial beams. Besides, according to the conventional method for OAM multiplexing, an angle‐multiplexed reflective metasurface working at 0.3 THz is designed for comparison. The simulation results show that only three‐channel multiplexing can be obtained by this model with nine‐channel incident waves. The proposed method has a great potential to enhance the transmission capacity of the communication system.",

The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) AVDPs of inorganic cubic ABX 3 perovskites (where A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Ge, Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) are systematically investigated using ab‐initio simulations. Spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) is found to have negligible effect on the AVDPs of ABX 3 perovskites, though it plays an important role in their band structures. The AVDPs of VBM are determined to be all negative and large, meaning the energy level will shift downward as the crystal volumes increase, while AVDPs of CBM are mostly positive and small. The AVDPs of VBM and CBM both increase as the atomic number of X‐site element increases, while the absolute value of VBM's AVDP increases initially and decreases afterward as atomic number of B‐site element becomes larger. These trends can be well explained based on the atomic orbital levels, the hybridization of the band edge orbitals, bond length, and bandwidth. These results provide critical parameters for the band structure engineering design of optoelectronic devices based on the ABX 3 halide perovskites through strain control.",

The main idea under the indirect method is constructing a thermodynamic cycle, exploring the configurational space under a cheaper but less accurate QM level, and performing an alchemical correction to obtain the thermodynamics under an accurate but computationally demanding QM level. In the authors' previous works, a multi‐dimensional nonequilibrium free energy simulation framework was developed to obtain QM/MM free energy landscapes indirectly, where the QM theory is varied but the other details of the multi‐scale treatment remain unchanged. In this work, the possibility of changing the region for electronic structure calculations in the multi‐scale treatment is explored. Numerical tests are performed for the conformational change in a biologically relevant peptide in vacuo and in solution, and the QM region and QM level are varied simultaneously. Unidirectional and bidirectional equilibrium perturbations are also performed for comparison. The indirect estimates from the nonequilibrium perturbation framework are almost identical to the direct results, while the indirect equilibrium estimates show obvious deviations from the direct references. They further derive the acceleration ratio of the indirect scheme to understand when the indirect scheme prevails.",

Due to directivity and saturation of H‐bond, its formation is influenced by macromolecular chain conformation but the relationship is still not well understood up to now. In this paper, amorphous models of polyamide 66 (PA66), polyamide 6T (PA6T), and poly( p ‐phenylene‐terephthamide) (PPTA) are built to study influence of chain rigidity on H‐bonding formation by utilizing Molecular Dynamics simulation. Compared with PA66 and PA6T, it is found that chain rigidity of PPTA is more remarkable and corresponding conformation adjustment is hindered more significantly, which leads to considerable weak H‐bonds and free H‐bonding sites. After introducing benzimidazole moiety into PPTA, more H‐bonds form due to more potential H‐bonding sites in benzimidazole units. However, the newly added H‐bonding donor and acceptor are in the co‐ring, and there is a high rotational energy barrier for benzimidazole ring, both of which hinder the formation of strong H‐bonds. Therefore, a strategy is proposed to fill free H‐bonding sites in rigid‐chain polymers through adding oligomers with high movement ability. Thus, the H‐bonds in rigid‐chain polymers are effectively enhanced due to bridging effect of oligomers and tensile modulus of the aramid is improved significantly.",

Should also testing be relaxed, a resurgent COVID-19 wave in winter 2021/2022 might be witnessed. In response to this risk, an additional vaccine dose, the booster shot, is being administered worldwide. A projected study with an outlook of 6 months explores the interplay between the rate at which boosters are distributed and the extent to which testing practices are implemented, using a highly granular agent-based model tuned on a medium-sized US town. Theoretical projections indicate that the administration of boosters at the rate at which the vaccine is currently administered could yield a severe resurgence of the pandemic. Projections suggest that the peak levels of mid-spring 2021 in the vaccination rate may prevent such a scenario to occur, although exact agreement between observations and projections should not be expected due to the continuously evolving nature of the pandemic. This study highlights the importance of testing, especially to detect asymptomatic individuals in the near future, as the release of the booster reaches full speed.",

Here, the electronic structure of such molecules, obtained using density functional theory, is considered. Based on the calculations, it is found that the tetrameric boron bond is stabilized by an inductive effect at the axial substituent and by conjugative effects across the ring system. It is further found that stability is dictated mostly by the axial moiety, such that Br‐BsubPc is the most fitting precursor structure for further synthesis steps, whereas F‐BsubPc is the most suitable candidate for long‐term device performance. H‐BsubPc is examined as a new BsubPc derivative, and found to be too volatile for long term device performance. Finally, it is shown that peripheral substitution dictates the position of frontier orbitals, thereby allowing for essentially separate optimization of material properties and material stability.",

In van der Waals structures, the interlayer distance controls the proximity effect on the electronic structure, and the interlayer interaction energy indicates the possibility to mechanically exfoliate a layered material. For upcoming twisted van der Waals heterostructures, a reliable but efficient and scalable theoretical scheme to correctly predict the interlayer distance is required. Therefore, the performance of a series of popular London dispersion corrections combined with computationally affordable density functionals is validated. As reference data, the experimental interlayer distance of layered bulk materials is used, and corresponding interlayer interaction energies are calculated using the random phase approximation. We demonstrate that the SCAN‐rVV10 and PBE‐rVV10L functionals predict interlayer interaction energies and interlayer distances of the studied layered systems within the range of the defined error limits of 10 meV per atom and 0.12 Å, respectively. Semi‐empirical and empirical dispersion‐corrected functionals show significantly larger error bars, with PBE+dDsC performing best with comparable quality of geometries, but with higher interlayer interaction energy error limits of ≈20 meV per atom.",

As these liquids are designed to solvate solutes, whether the solvation thermodynamics could be correctly described is of utmost importance. Therefore, we present a comprehensive large‐scale calculation of solvation free energies via nonequilibrium fast‐switching simulations for a spectrum of molecules in ionic liquids, the atomic charges of which are scaled to maximize the prediction‐experiment correlation. Further, the density‐derived choice is compared with the solvation‐thermodynamics‐derived one. When the scaling factor is decreased, the density exhibits a monotonically decreasing behavior due to weaker inter‐molecular interactions produced by scaled atomic charges. However, solvation free energies do not show consistent monotonic behaviors, which are caused by competing electrostatic and vdW responses to the scaling‐parameter variation. More intriguingly, the solvation‐free‐energy‐derived scaling factor is generally slightly higher than the density‐derived one. We further calculate partition coefficients ortransfer free energies of solutes from water to ionic liquids to provide another thermodynamic perspective of charge scaling. Another central result is the detailed evaluation of the widely used force fields for bonded and vdW terms, i.e., the GAFF derivatives.",

All molecules are physisorbed on H‐ASnNR(6) through van der Waals interactions, indicating a potential use for this material in recoverable gas sensors, and all gas molecules act as acceptors. Additionally, the highest and the lowest charge transfer is related to the NO and CO 2 molecules, respectively.

The results demonstrate that compared to pristine H‐ASnNR(6), the transmission function of the gas plus H‐ASnNR(6) system undergoes a significant change, particularly after the adsorption of NO and NO 2 molecules.

Industrial defects are diverse and complex, and well‐known machine learning based methods can often not effectively extract features of industrial defects and achieve good detection results. To address the above problems, this paper introduces a deep learning model for industrial defect detection. First, a two‐branch decoupled head, which can facilitate model training through separating the prediction of category and regression is designed. Also, two inverted bottleneck structures are designed to enhance the ability of the model to extract features. Moreover, an attention‐enhanced feature fusion (AEFF) module is designed and integrated into the neck network to achieve effective feature fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, namely the DeepPCB dataset, NEU‐DET dataset, and NRSD‐MN dataset. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared to the state‐of‐the‐art methods. The proposed model achieves mAP@0.5:0.95, 71.78%, 36.04%, and 48.69% on the PCB dataset, NEU‐DET dataset, and the NRSD‐MN dataset, respectively.",

To address these challenges and enhance the built‐in potential and carrier collection, an effective hole‐transport layer (HTL), e.g. CdS, which contains toxic components is used. A less‐toxic alternative is explored: ZnSe as the electron‐transport layer (ETL) to mitigate this issue.

The HTL plays a critical role in improving the effectiveness of the built‐in potential, enhancing carrier collection, and suppressing back surface recombination. The analysis involves varying the thickness and doping concentration of the absorber, buffer, and HTLs, and exploring the impact of temperature, series and shunt resistance, and the metal work function of the back contact. Among the tested devices, the one with NiO as the HTL demonstrates the highest efficiency, exhibiting a V OC (open‐circuit voltage) of 0.81 V and a PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 24.07%.",

Pristine monolayer is a non‐magnetic semiconductor 2D material with energy gap of 1.52(2.21) eV as predicted by PBE(HSE06) functional. Single Si vacancy (), Si+P divacancy (), and substituting one P atom by one Si atom () magnetize significantly SiP monolayer. Herein, total magnetic moments between 1.00 and 2.00 are obtained . In contrast, no magnetism is induced by single P vacancy (), substituting one Si atom by one P atom (), and exchanging pair Si‐P positions (). Moreover, significant magnetization of SiP monolayer is also achieved by doping with single Li and Cu atoms ( and ), as well as pair of Li and Cu atoms ( and ). Total magnetic moments between 0.84 and 1.42 are obtained. Interestingly, the half‐metallicity is observed in and systems. When substituting P atom, F, Cl, and Br impurities reduce significantly the SiP monolayer bandgap, preserving its non‐magnetic nature. In contrast, a total magnetic moment of 1.26 is obtained by doping with I atom. Results presented herein may introduce the defected and doped SiP systems as prospective 2D candidates for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A pivotal challenge in advancing inorganics optoelectronic technologies, is the precise characterization of materials' electronic attributes, with the bandgap being a critical property. Conventional approaches, heavily reliant on time‐intensive and financially demanding experimental and computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, face limitations due to inherent estimation errors. Machine learning methodologies are developed for the prediction of bandgaps of inorganic semiconductors but most of them are employed for datasets created by DFT calculations, hence limiting their performance. Addressing this, the study leverages machine learning methodologies, harnessing both compositional and structural features, to predict the band gaps of inorganic semiconductors with enhanced accuracy. This advancement is reinforced by the employment of an experimental bandgap dataset, which, when integrated with structural descriptors obtained from the Materials Project, significantly improves prediction capabilities. This is evidenced by the model's exceptional performance across two distinct benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model's adeptness in predicting formation energies underscores its versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of electronic properties. These findings suggest that the predictive accuracy of this model can be further augmented through the inclusion of additional experimental bandgap measurements and the refinement of structural descriptors. This approach offers a promising and efficient alternative to traditional methodologies, potentially accelerating the development of optoelectronic technologies.",

In this study, 12 molecules employing phenyl carbazole and a peripheral phenanthroimidazole as the donors and fused cores as acceptors are theoretically designed. Additionally, electron‐withdrawing groups such as fluorine and cyano, as well as electron‐donating group like methoxy, are incorporated into anthracene, napthaoxadiazole, and napthothiadiazole derivatives, acting as fused core components. Theoretical analyses reveal that among the molecules examined, eight adhere to the three golden principle rules, demonstrating a large energy gap between S 1 ‐T 1 , the minimal ΔE S1‐T2 , and large T 2 ‐T 1 . Additionally, these molecules exhibit significant Spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) and maintain a strong Hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) character, facilitating the fast hRISC from T 2 to S 1 . The auxiliary inclusion of heteroatoms, such as oxygen and sulfur, on the anthracene core, aligns with the prerequisite strategy, ultimately reinforcing the SOC. Furthermore, replacing the methoxy group on the Nz bridge significantly enhances the SOC, resulting in a substantial increase in the hRISC rate (10 + 08 s −1 ). Overall, the findings substantially elevate the photophysical attributes of the designed molecules through the utilization of the hRISC channel.",

However, while their implementation for classical transport governed by exponential step‐length distributions is well‐established, widely accepted approaches are still lacking for the more general class of anomalous transport phenomena. In this work, a set of rules for performing MC simulations in anomalous diffusion media is identified, which is also applicable in the case of finite‐size geometries and/or heterogeneous inclusions. The results are presented in the context of radiative transfer, however their implications extend to all types of anomalous transport. The proposed set of rules exhibits full compatibility with the pathlength invariance property for random trajectories, and with the important radiometric concept of fluence. Additionally, it reveals the counter‐intuitive possibility of introducing interfaces between independent subdomains with identical properties, which arise from the fact that non‐exponential step‐length distributions have a “memory” that can in principle be reset when traversing a boundary. These results have far‐reaching consequences not just for the physical interpretation of the corrections required to handle these discontinuities, but also for their experimental verification, due to their expected effects on the observable pathlength distributions.",

The study utilized the Perdew‐Burke‐Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA‐PBE) and the Tran‐Blaha‐Johnson (TB‐mBJ) approximations for the exchange‐correlation potential. The findings reveal that both alloys are semiconductors with indirect band gaps, and they are ductile, anisotropic, and mechanically stable. These properties make them suitable for various practical applications. The electronic analysis confirms the semiconducting nature of RuZrSi and RuZrGe due to their indirect band gaps. Mechanically, both alloys show ductility and stability, enhancing their potential usability. Additionally, their thermoelectric properties are notable, with high Seebeck coefficients (S) and a significant figure of merit (ZT), indicating strong performance in thermoelectric devices. Optical properties, including the dielectric function and absorption coefficients, suggest these materials have considerable potential for photovoltaic and optical applications, especially in the UV and visible light spectrum. While these results are promising, experimental validation is required to confirm the theoretical predictions made in this study.",

Spin‐driven anomalous SPP steering such as SPP launching and focusing are numerically demonstrated by properly arranging the V‐shaped apertures, and enabling extra degrees of freedom in controlling the propagation of SPPs. It is worth noting that spin‐driven anomalous SPP launching can be achieved within a broad bandwidth (800–1100 nm), being more conducive to practical applications. Moreover, an improved theoretical model is established as a physical interpretation of anomalous SPP wavefront steering and the theoretical results agree well with numerical results. These results will largely enhance the flexibility and tunability to steer the wavefront of SPPs, giving rise to broad applications in plasmonic circuits, polarization sensitive beam splitting, and near‐field imaging.",

However, for a given waveguide geometry, the ENZ operating bandwidth is inherently narrow and the center frequency is fixed. Here, a reconfigurable ENZ medium is proposed and experimentally demonstrated with a wideband‐tunable supercoupling effect by means of inserting a metasurface inside the waveguide, named as substrate‐integrated impedance surface (SIIS). With different insertion depth (which can be mechanically tuned) of SIIS, the ENZ supercoupling frequency can be precisely controlled. The proposed technique not only achieves wideband tuning of the ENZ supercoupling, especially to control the enhanced group delay of the electromagnetic waves, thereby offering a promising way toward for tunable slow‐light devices, such as light storage and processing components.",

Compared to Cs 2 AgBiX 6 , Cs 2 AgInX 6 may be more suitable to flexible devices due to its higher shear and bulk modulus.

Thus, the underlying molecular phenomena differ from the entropically dominated hydrophobic effect. In quest for a molecular‐scale understanding, we report on the molecular arrangement of nonamphiphilic structures of an anionic boron cluster compound, COSAN. We synergistically combine experimental (NMR and calorimetry) and theoretical (molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations) approaches. The experimental data support the mechanism of closed association of COSAN, where the self‐assembly is driven by the enthalpy contribution to the free energy. Molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent show that water molecules form a patchy network around COSAN molecules, giving rise to the strong hydrophobic self‐association. In the second solvation shell, water forms a slightly hydrophilic “spot” close to the C‐H segments of the cluster. The simulations further show a counterintuitive short‐range [COSAN] − ∙∙∙[COSAN] − attraction and Na + ∙∙∙[COSAN] − repulsion. Quantum chemical calculations reveal a major role of solvation in stabilizing the contact pairs. Further, the calculations show the parallel/X‐shape geometrical arrangements of COSAN dimers as the most preferred. Lastly, dihydrogen bonding are found to influence the structure of micelles. In summary, we provide a molecular view of nonclassical micellization that can be extended to other amphiphiles like boranes.",

These new types of risks do not respect national boundaries nor are they restricted to particular locations or systems. Instead, they are characterized by contagion and proliferation processes, frequently on the basis of a network structure, with the result that a seemingly harmless local event is able to cause a complete system collapse. The proposal has been made to refer to these types of new risks as systemic risks. It turns out that key phenomena associated with systemic risks can quite naturally be categorized and analyzed in terms of notions originally established in the natural sciences, such as those of chaos, order, and self‐organization, or, more concisely, of dynamic structure generation in complex open systems. In this Essay, the claim is made that there is a homomorphism within the dynamic structure generation across very different domains of systemic risks. Furthermore, there are structural similarities between complex structures in general, and systemic risks in particular. Based on this assumption, one can use established methodologies of complexity science to reveal general macroscopic patterns that seem to govern the dynamics of complex systems.",

However, the experiments necessary to determine microscopic parameters underlying such processes are complex and the interpretation of their results is not straightforward. Here, a multiscale simulation protocol to treat TTA is presented, in which microscopic parameters are computed with ab initio electronic structure methods. With this protocol, virtual photoluminescence experiments are performed on a prototypical PhOLED emission material consisting of 93 wt% of 4,4ʹ,4ʺ‐tris( N ‐carbazolyl)triphenylamine and 7 wt% of the green phosphorescent dye fac‐tris(2‐phenylpyridine)iridium. A phenomenological TTA quenching rate of 8.5 × 10 −12 cm 3 s −1 , independent of illumination intensity, is obtained. This value is comparable to experimental results in the low‐intensity limit but differs from experimental rates at higher intensities. This discrepancy is attributed to the difficulties in accounting for fast bimolecular quenching during exciton generation in the interpretation of experimental data. This protocol may aid in the experimental determination of TTA rates, as well as provide an order‐of‐magnitude estimate for device models containing materials for which no experimental data are available.",

According to the results obtained from first‐principle calculation, the mobility and absorption coefficient of CsPbIBr 2 and CsPbI 2 Br along the [001] orientation are larger than those along the [100] orientation, suggesting that the transport properties and optical properties along the [001] orientation are superior to those along the [100] orientation. According to the results obtained from the drift‐diffusion model, owing to the superior optical and transport characters along the [001] direction, the optimal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of CsPbI 2 Br (18.88%) and CsPbIBr 2 (16.42%) solar cells can be obtained. In addition, the two‐terminal CsPbI x Br 3‐x /silicon tandem solar cell is also investigated. By utilizing CsPbIBr 2 /silicon and CsPbI 2 Br/silicon tandem structures along the [001] orientation, ultrahigh efficiencies are achieved up to 26.32% and 31.39%, respectively. Therefore, the [001] crystal orientation of CsPbIBr 2 and CsPbI 2 Br is more suitable for further applications of optoelectronic devices.",

Whereas full atomistic resolution is desired in the region of interest, there is some freedom in the implementation of the reservoirs. Here, a combined, explicit reservoir is constructed by interfacing the atomistic region with regions of point‐like, non‐interacting particles (tracers) embedded in a thermodynamic mean field. The tracer molecules acquire atomistic resolution upon entering the atomistic region and equilibrate with this environment, while atomistic molecules become tracers governed by an effective mean‐field potential after crossing the atomistic boundary. The approach is extensively tested on thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic properties of liquid water.

This work focuses on infrared and vibrational circular dichroism for which the latter is extremely sensitive to such complicated situations. Here two possible ways to perform spectroscopy calculations for such situations are investigated. The first approach is based on static quantum chemical calculations employing cluster‐weighting. The second approach is rooted in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using the time correlations approach. For the present example (( R )‐butan‐2‐ol), excellent spectra from simulations are obtained for gas and bulk, when the former is averaged over trajectories with all possible starting conformers and these are scaled to match the experimental spectrum. The cluster‐weighted approach is inferior to the simulations but still reaches very good results at much less computational cost. A simplified, but computationally less expensive simulation approach is considered by approximating the electric and magnetic moments, which are input quantities in the correlation function, by classical equations and different populations analysis for the required partial charges. The results are inferior to the full simulations but still give satisfying results at the advantage of being much faster to calculate.",

However, a single layer of 2D materials may not have a certain property adequately, or multiple application‐specific properties simultaneously to the desired and optimal level. For mitigating this lacuna, a new trend has emerged recently to develop nano‐scale engineered heterostructures by stacking multiple layers of different 2D materials, wherein each of the layers could also be twisted. The vast advantage of combining single layers of different 2D materials with different twisting angles has dramatically expanded this research field well beyond the scope of considering a 2D material mono‐layer, leading to a set of multifunctional physical properties corresponding to each possible combination of number of layers, different 2D materials therein, stacking sequence and the twisting angle of each layer. Effective mechanical properties such as Young's moduli are generally of utmost importance for analyzing the viability of such engineered nano‐heterostructures in various nanoelectromechanical applications. Efficient closed‐form generic formulae are proposed for the effective Young's moduli of twisted multi‐layer heterostructures. Based on this physics‐based analytical approach, a wide range of insightful new results are presented for twisted heterostructures, covering mono‐planar and multi‐planar configurations with homogeneous and heterogeneous atomic distributions.",

Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) functional belonging to the generalized‐gradient approximation (GGA) is implemented. For the better estimation of electronic parameters, the Tran–Blaha modified Becke–Johnson (TB‐mBJ) potential is employed. The elastic parameters such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, the Pugh's ratio, anisotropy factor, Poisson's coefficient, and melting temperature ( T m ) are estimated within Voigt‐Ruess‐Hill approximations. The energy band structure results, total density of states (TDOS), partial density of states (PDOS) outcomes, and isosurface charge density contour plots disclose that Sn 2+ and I 1− are more appropriate divalent cation and anion respectively, among all studied composites especially for the application of photoresponsive resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices. Moreover, partial density of states (PDOS) outcomes depict that conduction band formation is consequence of hybridization of electrons from p ‐orbitals of divalent cations, i.e., Pb, Sn and I/Br/Cl halogen anions. Besides, regarding charge conduction Sn‐based composites offer minimal energy bandgap as compared to Pb‐based composites. The energy bandgap order for Sn‐based compounds is found as CsSnI 3 &gt; CsSnBr 3 &gt; CsSnCl 3. The optical analysis renders that CsSnI 3 have the capability to absorb a wide range of ultraviolet (UV), visible and infrared (IR) electromagnetic incident radiations thus, make it much suitable material for optoelectronic memristors and associated applications.",

As partial shading (PS) may reduce the harvested energy of PV systems, this paper proposes a novel tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA) based MPPT (maximum power point tracking) strategy to tackle the PS issue. More specifically, the simple and effective modeling of TSA with a search and skipping (SAS) scheme is utilized to minimize the tracking time and search area. The SAS scheme can discard the voltage range lacking global maximum power point (GMPP) and significantly reduce computation time. Consequently, power tracking, tracking time, and robustness can be greatly enhanced. The performance of the proposed TSA strategy is comprehensively analyzed against state‐of‐the‐art techniques, including incremental conductance (InC), improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), through detailed case studies, which include standard array configurations, PS conditions, varying irradiance patterns, fast‐changing temperature, and the field atmospheric data. TSA is further validated on a low‐cost hardware setup, confirming its superior performance. The results provide insightful validation of the practicality of the proposed TSA strategy in the real‐world applications.",

The object‐oriented platform provided by the MATLAB‐based modeling environment SIMSCAPE is employed to compute blood pressures and flows in each heart chamber and at various sites of the vascular tree. The hydraulic domain allows the determination of cardiovascular hemodynamics intuitively from geometrical and mechanical properties of the system, while custom elements model the pumping action of the heart and the effects of respiration on blood flow. The model is validated by comparing predicted hemodynamics with normal physiology during both systole and diastole, demonstrating that changes in arterial pressures with breathing are consistent with reported physiological effects of cardiorespiratory coupling. The capabilities of this platform are explored through two exemplary case studies: i) pressure‐overload heart failure due to aortic constriction, validated in vitro and via finite element analysis, and ii) single‐ventricle Fontan physiology, validated in vitro and compared with the clinical literature. This platform provides a practical tool for the calculation of cardiovascular hemodynamics from hydraulic parameters, enabling the intuitive creation of in silico representations of complex circulatory loops, the planning and optimization of medical interventions, and the prediction of clinically relevant patient‐specific hemodynamics.",

The abrupt set‐up is derived having in mind the idea of the atomistically resolved region as an open system embedded in a large reservoir at a given macroscopic state. In this work, starting from the idea of open systems, the authors derive thermodynamic relations for AdResS which justify conceptually and numerically the claim of AdResS as a technique for simulating open systems. In particular, the relation between the chemical potential of the AdResS set‐up and that of its reference fully atomistic simulation is derived. The implication of this result is that the grand potential of AdResS can be explicitly written and thus, from a statistical mechanics point of view, the atomistically resolved region of AdResS can be identified with a well‐defined open system.",

In the proposed method, the noise is removed by WT, and the original data are decomposed into several groups with low or high frequencies, and then the decomposed column variables are used as characteristic variables to forecast by RF. It has three advantages: 1) due to the instability of electric load data, the decomposition and denoising of WT can be used to characterize the nonstationary signal characteristics; 2) WT has more advantages in time domain analysis because of its correlation to signal removal and the tendency of noise whitening after transformation; and 3) based on WT, RF still maintains forecasting accuracy even after the features of the analyzed data are lost. Electric load data from Australian‐Energy‐Market‐Operator are taken as an example for a case analysis. By comparing with other existed methods, the results have showed that the proposed model can reduce the influence of random noise during forecasting processes and improve the associated accuracy and reliability.",

For both functionals, methods to determine the mixing parameter α are explored, and for HSE, the impact of the screening‐parameter ω is investigated. An extensive investigation of PbI 2 , a precursor of many HaPs, leads to the conclusion that hybrid functionals with α tuned by the density‐based mixing method are most suitable for obtaining band gaps comparable to results. Moreover, this methodology is transferable to CsPbI 3 , and the same behavior is expected for the entire family of lead–iodine perovskites.",

An efficient method of parameter identification and SOC estimation for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) using cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and least square with gradient correction is proposed. Firstly, the recursive gradient correction (RGC) strategy is introduced based on the recursive least square with forgetting factor (FFRLS) method, and a novel way is proposed for a simplified equivalent circuit model (ECM) based LIBs parameter identification using the combination of RGC and FFRLS method. Then, on the basis of CKF, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is used instead of the Cholesky decomposition to solve the non‐positive definiteness matrix for cubature transformation in the priori estimated covariance, thereby improving the effect of SOC estimation. Finally, the dynamic stress test (DST) and the federal urban driving schedule (FUDS) are used to verify the effect of the proposed method. The test results reflect that the combination of RGCFFRLS‐SVDCKF method and simplified ECM have advantages in terms of LIBs SOC estimation convergence ability and tracking accuracy, and the SOC estimation error can converge to 1% and 1.5% error boundary when the initial SOC are 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. In addition, the robustness of the proposed method is verified. Compared with the FFRLS‐EKF method, the proposed RGCFFRLS‐SVDCKF method has better precision and robustness to noise disturbance.",

When the noise intensity is significantly lower than the fixed point of the system, the performance of a GIM is not influenced by the fluctuation of the noise intensity. However, the noise in this study is limited to Gaussian white noise. The influence of prevalent colored noise on GIMs has not been researched. In this study, the influence of common‐colored noise on the performance of GIMs is numerically investigated. The results of a domain clustering dynamics analysis reveal that red noise can better suppress the generation of the noise‐induced irregular temporary domain. Furthermore, several prevalent MAXCUT problem topologies, including the Moebius ladder, random Moebius ladder, and 2D random lattice, are adopted as test benchmarks. The results reveal that GIMs influenced by white, blue, and violet noise perform better at low‐intensity noise condition. In contrast, pink and red noise‐injected GIMs demonstrate higher performances when applied to MAXCUT topologies with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic connections under larger noise intensity conditions. This indicates that the noise dispersion can be used as an additional hyperparameter to optimize the performance of GIMs.",

After discretizing the space variables as in conventional finite difference methods, this method does not use a finite difference approximation for the time derivatives, it instead combines constant‐neighbor and linear‐neighbor approximations, which decouple the ordinary differential equations, thus they can be solved analytically. In the obtained three‐stage method, the time step size appears in exponential form with negative coefficients in the final expression. This property guarantees unconditional stability, as it is shown using von Neumann stability analysis. It is also proved that the convergence of the method is third order in the time step size. After verification, by solving Fisher's and Huxley's equations, it is demonstrated that it works for nonlinear equations as well. The new algorithm is tested against widely used numerical solvers for cases where the media is strongly inhomogeneous. According to the results, the new method is significantly more effective than the traditional explicit or implicit methods, especially for extremely large stiff systems. It is believed that this new method is unique in the sense that it is the first unconditionally stable explicit method with third‐order convergence.",

MOF‐74, a material envisioned for many applications, shows a different behavior. Temperature‐dependent X‐ray diffraction reveals particularly small negative (positive) thermal expansion coefficients perpendicular (parallel) to the hexagonally arranged pores. These trends are explained by combining density‐functional theory calculations with the Grüneisen theory of thermal expansion, which allows tracing back thermal expansion to contributions of individual phonons. On the macroscopic level, the small thermal expansion coefficients arise from compensation effects caused by the large coupling between perpendicular stress and strain and by the small magnitudes of the mean Grüneisen tensor elements, 〈 γ 〉. These provide information on how strains impact phonon frequencies. To understand the small value of 〈〉, the individual mode contributions are analyzed using the corresponding atomic motions. This reveals that only the lowest frequency modes up to ≈3 THz provide non‐negligible contributions, such that 〈〉 drops sharply at higher temperatures. These considerations reveal, how the details of the anharmonic properties of specific phonon bands determine the magnitude and sign of thermal expansion in a prototypical material like MOF‐74. Beyond that, the authors also discuss, how the choice of the theoretical methodology impacts the obtained results.",

In this work, a concurrent learning scheme is implemented to automatically generate ML interatomic potential for the MgCl 2 ‐NaCl eutectic. This scheme allows to train ML interatomic potential with training datasets approximately four times smaller than that of previous work, which significantly reduces the computational cost. The learned ML interatomic potential is used to accelerate the ab initio estimation of the properties of MgCl 2 ‐NaCl eutectic, thermal conductivity in particular. With the learned models, simulations are conducted on multiple system sizes (1464–4392 atoms) and a wide temperature range (773–1073 K). The impact of the finite‐size effect on simulated thermal conductivity and derived size‐independent thermal conductivity is carefully investigated. The simulated thermal conductivities decrease with temperature and are in the range 0.469–0.538 W m −1 K −1 at 773–1073 K, which is in reasonable agreement with the literature data. Overall, the training scheme and the learned potential have produced reliable and satisfactory results, and promise to open up new avenues in the computational modeling of molten salts.",

The specimen geometry may also favor global buckling. In this study, a recently developed computational approach is employed to directly simulate 3D wrinkling and buckling from pre‐instability to post‐instability in a straightforward manner, covering a wide biaxial loading spectrum. The finite element models contain an embedded imperfection with perturbed material properties at the film‐substrate interface. This approach is capable of activating the first and subsequent bifurcation modes, along with the deformation patterns in between. It is demonstrated that, in addition to the temporal evolution of wrinkle patterns, surface wrinkling and global buckling can form simultaneously as the substrate becomes thinner. Wrinkles and buckle can either co‐develop, or the buckling‐induced curvature may help facilitate wrinkle formation depending on the specimen thickness and loading biaxiality. Different wrinkle patterns, such as parallel waveform and checkerboard, can even coexist on the same buckled structure. The state of biaxiality can influence the deformation instability significantly, and each bifurcation point can be traced back to certain abrupt changes in the overall load–displacement response.",

The recent implementation of graph neural networks (GNN) in materials science enables fast prediction of crystal formation energy with a DFT accuracy. Starting from the MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet), transfer learning is applied to develop a model for predicting hydride formation enthalpy based on the crystal structure of the starting intermetallic. Excellent accuracy is achieved for Mg‐containing alloys, allowing the screening of the Mg─Ni─M ternary intermetallics.

Besides, potential energy surfaces are constructed to evaluate the dominant PT pathway in EtOH, and the related transition state structures are also obtained to accurately provide the intra‐ and inter‐PT energy barriers. Eventually, excited‐state ab initio molecular dynamics computation reaffirms that the intra‐PT reaction is predominant for SA.

In this work, an analytical model for the experimental Sb2Se3 solar cell has been presented to investigate the effect of the HDP layer characteristics on the J–V distortion. This proposed model can also calculate the critical voltage at which the J–V distortion occurs. The results show that the Sb2Se3 solar cells with the HDP layer have low efficiency when doping concentration and thickness of the HDP layer increase due to a large J–V distortion. This study confirms that the presence of an electron barrier in the conduction band formed by the HDP layer can cause J–V distortion. Hence, the effect of electron barrier height on cell performance based on the derived formulas is investigated. Finally, comparing the simulation and modeling results with variations of the physical and electrical properties of the HDP layer provides a good evaluation for understanding the behavior of Sb2Se3 solar cells.",

The modeling is based on potentials and the materials constituting the wires can be local (described by the local response model) or nonlocal (described by the nonlocal hydrodynamic model). The nonlocal hydrodynamic model (HDM) provides an important approximation describing nonclassical effects associated with the collective motion of free electrons in metals. The modeling is challenging as different interface conditions are needed at a boundary which separates 1) a local medium from a local medium; 2) a local ( nonlocal ) medium from a nonlocal ( local ) medium; and 3) a nonlocal medium from a nonlocal medium. The algorithm can address constructs of arbitrary geometry and material composition within the HDM; thus, it becomes a complete numerical tool for exploration of nonlocal nanowires. Fictitious sources are imposed at the boundaries, linking the scattered fields to the imposed sources, and matching the interface conditions at the boundaries. This procedure yields a set of Boundary Integral Equations (BIEs). Then, the BIEs are numerically solved utilizing the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The results from the BEM solver are verified quantitatively and qualitatively showing good agreement in both the near‐ and the far‐field regimes.",

However, being a highly resistive material, CdTe produces considerable contact resistance and drastically reduces the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Introducing a back surface field layer at the contact region may significantly improve the device's performance. This work investigates the suitability of using ZnSe and CdSe layer as a back‐surface‐field layer in CdTe‐based solar cells through accurate electronic structure calculations using the hybrid‐density functional theory method. The calculations show that both ZnSe/CdTe and CdSe/CdTe behave as type‐II heterojunctions with band gaps of 2.0 and 1.1 eV, respectively. The Mulliken electronegativity method is used to determine the correct band edge positions concerning the vacuum level for all the pristine semiconductors and their interfaces. Calculation shows that a significant charge redistribution in the interface leads to the formation of an effective local field near the contact region for both ZnSe/CdTe and CdSe/CdTe heterostructures. This local field may help to separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the active layer by pushing the opposite charges into the two different sections of the heterojunction. Additionally, the heterojunctions also exhibit better light‐absorption characteristics in the visible light range.",

The external mechanical strains also significantly tailor the optical properties of GaSe, the exciton binding energy is strongly reduced when the tensile strain is applied, while the opposite way is true for compressive stress. Moreover, the inhomogeneous strain also induces a nonuniform electronic screening environment and strong polarization in the absorption spectra.

Recently, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.40% (front illumination) and 20.01% (rear illumination) of bifacial PSC has shown immense potential to take over the photovoltaic industry. However, the PCE bifacial PSCs still have a long way to go, as compared to their mono‐facial PSCs counterparts (PCE 26.1%). This gap in the performance level propels us to get more insight into the device physics of bifacial PSCs. In this work, bifacial PSCs are simulated and optimized by selecting an appropriate choice of the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). In this study, it is found that the conduction band offset (CBO) and valance band offset (VBO) play a vital role in choosing a proper charge‐selective layer. The band alignment highly affects the Shockley‐Read‐Hall (SRH) recombination rate and consequently, the device performance. The bandgap of the rear transparent electrode (RTE) plays a vital role in photo‐absorption and band alignment at the HTL/RTE interface and hence the device performance. This investigation reveals that the perovskite absorber material should be intrinsic in semiconducting nature to achieve a higher bifacial factor from the device.",

A recurring task is the selection of the smallest control volume that leads to convergence, which means that the model outputs are accurate and sufficiently free from stochastic noise and do not significantly change upon further increasing this volume. Selecting a too high (safe) control volume leads to an excessive simulation time, while many small incremental control volume increases are inefficient. This work therefore presents an automated tool to determine the smallest control volume leading to convergence. The tool is illustrated for (intrinsic) free radical and nitroxide mediated polymerization (FRP/NMP), in which the chain length distribution (CLD) is a crucial output. The algorithm starts with a very low volume to then check if the desired (monomer) conversion can be reached, the number average chain length is accurate, and finally the signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio at the CLD level is below a threshold. The execution time of the algorithm is less than twice the time of running the converged simulation directly, hence, saving tremendous time in setting up a k MC simulation and facilitating benchmark studies even beyond polymer reaction engineering applications.",

The results suggest that the registration precision of global point clouds is 6 mm. The global ovality of the LNG storage tank is 0.053%, with a tilt change of 2.58° and a deviation of 27 mm in the direction of the azimuth of 321.98°, an average value of 0.07 mm for depression and protrusion deformation, and a surface flatness of 21.3 mm. In this case, the flatness is greater than the variation threshold of the standard specification, indicating that the tank may have structural uneven settlement or other deformation problems. The attraction of the proposed method resides in its capacity to efficiently and accurately obtain spatial positioning and color information of the LNG storage tank's exterior wall, thereby providing a robust foundation for precise judgments regarding the deformation state.",

Therefore, convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed with Logistic chaotic map and its corresponding fault diagnosis approach, which can effectively advance the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Specifically, the Logistic chaotic map and Sigmoid function are combined into a non‐monotonic excitation function, which is employed to the full connection layer of the CNN. The proposed chaotic CNN can solve two issues that the conventional neural network inclines to get the local minimum value and the gradient of Sigmoid excitation function disappears. It is applied to fault data from the center of Western Reserve University and from the American Society for Mechanical Failure Prevention technology (in noiseless and noisy conditions). The results indicate the diagnosis accuracy of the algorithm outperforms other classical bearing diagnosis algorithms. Moreover, the chaotic CNN exhibits better anti‐noise performance.",

This study proposes a hybrid model integrating the Feed forward Neural Network (FFNN) model and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to predict gas emissions from natural gas power plants.

Neighbor Component Analysis (NCA) selects parameters most correlated with CO and NOx emissions. The hybrid model is constructed, trained, and testedusing publicly available datasets, evaluating performance with statistical metrics like Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show significant improvement in FFNN training with the PSO algorithm, boosting CO and NOx prediction accuracy by 99.18% and 82.11%, respectively. The model achieves the lowest MSE, MAE, and RMSE values for CO and NOx emissions. Overall, the hybrid model achieves high prediction accuracy, particularly with optimized PSO parameter selection using seed random generators.",

In this research, a data‐driven injection molding process optimization framework is developed to simultaneously minimize warpage, cycle time, and clamping force. Employing multi‐objective Bayesian optimization (MBO), the framework is applied to a fan blade model for verification. Incorporating those objectives enables the selection of an injection molding machine with the proper maximum clamping force within acceptable tolerance and production time. Furthermore, non‐moldable regimes are considered in design space, which allows less prior knowledge for setting design space. The optimized results are compared with those obtained using NSGA‐III, a well‐established genetic algorithm‐based optimization technique, as a benchmark. The optimization frameworks produce a Pareto front for the three‐dimensional outputs, revealing distinct trade‐off relationships between cycle time and warpage, as well as clamping force and warpage. The MBO framework demonstrates a superior Pareto front compared to NSGA‐III when utilizing a limited data set, underscoring its benefits in scenarios where costly simulations or experiments are necessary. These findings are anticipated to contribute to the optimization of manufacturing processes, ultimately enhancing productivity in real‐world industries.",

In the utilization of such composite components, optimization of process parameters significantly influences material characteristics and part performance. However, in industrial practice, this process often relies on intuition and iterative experimentation. Prior studies have introduced data‐efficient optimization methods but faced limitations in adopting minor variations in the product development cycle. This study introduces a multi‐fidelity optimization framework aimed at efficiently addressing new problems by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from analogous domains, particularly accommodating alterations in material scenarios. Two data‐driven frameworks are explored: 1) Gaussian process‐based and 2) neural network‐based, each employing distinct information‐transferring techniques, hierarchical Kriging and transfer learning, respectively. Bayesian optimization of process parameters under limited data budget, which is typical in realistic industrial settings, is performed. The results highlight the efficiency of the proposed framework, demonstrating superior performance not only in data‐driven modeling but also in optimization efficiency compared to conventional single‐fidelity approaches. The Pearson correlation coefficient is utilized to assess the applicability of the multi‐fidelity framework in handling the inherent ambiguity of the similarity of problem scenarios. The proposed method is believed to be adaptable and versatile, offering potential application across various challenges in process optimization.",

Average voltage and specific capacity are two important indicators of electrode materials, which determine suitability of electrode materials in batteries. In this study, 4351 data are collected from Material Project and 324 features are extracted from Material Project or calculated by Matminer . Four ML models are discussed for prediction of average voltage and specific capacity. In order to ensure the prediction accuracy and efficiency of ML models, sequential backward selection (SBS) method is introduced to select optimal feature set, which can reduce redundancy features. The combination of Deep Neural Network model and optimal feature set selected by the SBS method achieves accurate prediction and outperforms Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network and Graph‐attention Graph Neural Network. The interpretability analysis provides insight into the relationship between features and two target properties. To cope with the poor prediction performance for metal‐ion battery with scarce data, transfer learning is adopted and an excellent improvement is achieved in the prediction in Na‐ion, Mg‐ion and Ca‐ion electrode material.

The natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations show that the X─H···Y H‐bonds in the studied complexes, namely, 7‐azaindole:piperidin‐2‐one (N‐form) and 7 H ‐pyrrolo[2,3‐ b ]pyridine:3,4,5,6‐tetrahydropyridin‐2‐ol (T‐form, proton transferred tautomer) are aptly described by hyperconjugative charge transfer effect ( is non‐bonded lone‐pair on Y‐atom). That the hyperconjugation effect outplays the rehybridization effect is invoked to account for the observed red‐shifting H‐bonds in harmony with the Bent's rule. The differential nature of interactions underlying the origin of X─H···Y H‐bonds in the complexes (N‐form and T‐form) is explored from atoms‐in‐molecules (AIM) calculations. The H‐bonds in the N‐form are found to have a primarily electrostatic origin (closed‐shell interaction) whereas the relatively stronger H‐bonds in the T‐form are assisted by contribution from shared‐shell (covalent) interaction. The nonoccurrence of the double‐proton transfer reaction in the S 0 state is argued from the large barrier for the transformation N‐form → T‐form (N‐form constitutes the global minimum on the S 0 ‐PEC), whereas the stability order is reversed together with a marked reduction of the energy barrier in the S 1 ‐PEC accounting for the ESDPT process.",

The most common techniques used for structural assignment are infrared, electronic, and NMR spectroscopies. Chemists can normally deduce the chemical structure of an unknown substance by using a vast collection of empirical relationships linking the spectral features with the presence or absence of functional groups and, this part mostly by NMR, the connectivity between them and the relative stereochemistry. Computational spectroscopy is a powerful aid for structural elucidation when empirical relationships do not suffice to unambiguously assign the structure. In these cases, the calculated spectrum of a putative structure is compared with the experimental one and the match, or lack thereof, between the two, measured by several statistical parameters, indicates whether or not that structure is the correct one. Is it possible to extend such protocols to bulk phases of complex fluids, such as ionic liquids, rather than covalent molecules, in order to get insights into the average structure of the fluid?

Whether these metastable structures retain their unique structures after long‐time operation in real working conditions is a key question for evaluating their practical value. Here, the stability of a metastable nanostructure is shown, for example, the metallic hollow nanocrystals (hNCs), can be measured at macroscopic time scales (up to days) by a combined approach of density functional theory, all‐atom kinetic Monte Carlo method, and a well‐fitted nearest neighbor bonds model. The real‐time simulation results give detailed information on the structural evolution of Pt nanocrystals at different temperatures, which reproduces the experimental observations well. Further studies reveal that the intrinsic instability of hNCs comes from the fact that the outer‐surface refacetts faster than the inner‐surface due to the coordination‐number imbalance between them. Eliminating the driving force can efficiently stabilize the metastable nanostructures. Based on the above understanding, a general strategy is proposed for the rational design of highly stable metallic hNCs. This work not only provides insightful information and useful guidance for a wide variety of applications of hollow nanocatalysts but also paves the way for real‐time simulations of complex nonequilibrium nanocrystal transformations in real conditions.",

With a single set of reference DFT calculations, computational alchemy approximates adsorbate binding energies (BEs) on a large number of hypothetical catalysts surfaces with negligible computational cost. Analogous to previous studies on metal alloys, computational alchemy predicts adsorbate BEs on rocksalt TiC(111), TiN(100), and TiO(100) materials, which have no bandgap, in close agreement with DFT results (with mean unsigned errors up to 0.33 eV). In contrast, it is found that semiconducting systems such as rutile TiO 2 (110), rutile SnO 2 (110), and rocksalt ZnO(100) can present more significant challenges. This work identifies these challenges being linked to the density of states at the Fermi level and by adding Pt dopants in the surface layer of TiO 2 , it is shown that computational alchemy can become more reliable with non‐transition metal systems.

C 5 N monolayer is verified to be chemically, mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable based on cohesive energy, elastic constants, phonon spectrum, and molecular dynamics calculations.

Here, a novel machine algorithm is applied to tailor a superplasticizer to address poor flowability characteristic of 15/85 blends of MK‐PC. A hierarchical machine learning (HML) system is trained on a library of seven superplasticizers using a middle layer, which represents underlying physical interactions that determine system responses, based on polymer contributions to physicochemical forces in both the pore solution and particle surface. Following reparameterization of the response surface by polymer composition, the trained algorithm predicted that a novel styrene sulfonate‐methacrylic acid‐poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate copolymer would maximize slump of the MK‐PC paste. Synthesis of the algorithm prediction resulted in a water‐soluble polymer with an extremely high intrinsic viscosity that nevertheless increased the slump flow of the MK‐PC paste but did not plasticize pure PC paste. The results from this study demonstrate the importance of HML as a design tool for the molecular engineering of complex material systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphene continues to attract considerable attention from the materials science community through its potential for improving the mechanical properties of polymer thermosets, yet there remains considerable uncertainty over the underlying mechanisms. The effect of introducing graphene sheets to a typical thermosetting polymer network on mechanical behaviour is explored here through concurrently coupling molecular dynamics with a finite element solver. In this multiscale approach, Graphene is observed to act in two ways: as passive microscopic defects, dispersing crack propagation (high deformation); and as active geometric constraints, impeding polymer conformational changes (low deformation). By contrast, single‐scale atomistic simulations alone predict little measurable difference in the properties of the graphene‐enhanced epoxy resins as compared with the pure polymer case. The multiscale model predicts that epoxy resins reinforced with graphene nanoparticles exhibit enhanced overall elastoplastic properties, reducing strain energy dissipation by up to 70%. Importantly, this is only observed when taking into account the complex boundary conditions, mainly involving shear, arising from coupling physics on length scales separated by five orders of magnitude. The approach herein clearly highlights a novel role of graphene nanoparticles in actively constraining the surrounding polymer matrix, impeding local dissipative mechanisms, and resisting shear deformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many computational methods have been developed and used for modeling, understanding, and tailoring extreme optical effects at the nanoscale. Among them, this review focuses on the integral equation‐based methods: within the local response limit, a potential‐based boundary integral equation (BIE) formalism and a field‐based volume integral equation (VIE) formalism; within the nonlocal hydrodynamic model, a potential‐based BIE formalism. These formalisms are derived from macroscopic electrodynamics (together with appropriate constitutive relations). The derivations are based on three pillars: the Green function, the field relation(s) (for the VIE formalism, the incident—scattered—total field relation; for the BIE formalism, the interface conditions connecting the fields at two sides of the interface), and the field equivalence principle (for the VIE formalism, the volume equivalence principle; for the BIE formalism, the Huygens principle). By applying the method of moments (MoM) algorithm, the derived integral equations are converted into matrix equations, with possible problems in the implementation being discussed. Levels of solutions, including the eigenmode and natural mode solutions, and group representation theory are introduced as powerful post‐processing steps. Many examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the reviewed algorithms.",

However, opposite variation tendencies on their pH‐dependent photoluminescence performance are observed in different experiments and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, based on time‐dependent density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, a synergistic mechanism between light absorption and radiative/nonradiative recombination of g‐C 3 N 4 QDs in neutral and acidic conditions is proposed to address the inconformity. Specifically, under weak acidic condition, the strong light absorption and weak nonradiative recombination of g‐C 3 N 4 QDs yield strong fluorescence emission. While under strong acidic condition, although the light absorption remains high, the fast nonradiative electron‐hole recombination dramatically reduces the population of the excited state and the fluorescence is quenched consequently. The protonation of N atom changes the orbital composition of transition channels and frontier molecular orbital overlap, which consequently modulates the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination as well as the emission performance. In addition, there is no obvious change in the variation tendency of absorption and emission properties of g‐C 3 N 4 QDs with different functional groups, implying the general applicability of understanding.",

In addition, the optimal case through the teaching‐learning‐based optimization is more robust and competitive than the optimal case through the particle swarm optimization in terms of the total heat gain.

The microstructures of such metamaterials are currently mostly determined by parameter synthesis on the basis of existing heuristic configuration designs, which may considerably restrict their topologies and shapes. New octagon and hexagonal honeycomb bi-mode metamaterials (2D) are designed through a more systematic approach based on the independent point-wise interpolation method of topology optimization. The objective function is defined as a weighted combination of the bulk and shear moduli. By tuning the values of different weighted coefficients, the transition mechanism can be acquired from the regular microstructure to the bi-mode metamaterial with needle-like or double-cone rods. It is also found that simply increasing the volume fraction in the single material design cannot further improve the target performance, but introducing a small amount of hard material into the design domain can noticeably enhance the bulk modulus. One representative optimized microstructure is fabricated by 3D printing with stainless steel and polymer materials. Uniaxial quasi-static compression tests and finite element simulations reveal the layer-wise deformation modes of the bi-mode “quasi-fluid” metamaterial and its capacity to absorb external energy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanoscale design of complex oxide heterostructures and thin films is imperative as they have significant promise in novel technological applications. A coherent interface is formed in oxide heterostructures with small mismatches, and the lattice mismatch is completely compensated by elastic strain. In semi‐coherent oxide heterostructures, when an epitaxial layer is grown on the substrate above the critical thickness of the film, misfit dislocations are formed to mitigate the strain between the two materials with dissimilar lattice constants. Key properties of semi‐coherent oxide heterostructures are influenced or even controlled by the presence of misfit dislocations. Therefore, it is critical to understand the atomic‐scale structure of semi‐coherent oxide heterostructures, specifically the structure of misfit dislocations that are ubiquitous at such heterointerfaces. Numerous state‐of‐the‐art experiments have reported emergent phenomena at semi‐coherent oxide heterostructures, wherein misfit dislocations play a crucial role. However, their atomic‐scale and nanoscale structure is not always discernable from experiments. Due to large system sizes, computational studies dedicated to examining misfit dislocations in semi‐coherent oxide heterostructures are still in their infancy. This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and challenges involved in computational studies elucidating the atomic‐scale structure of misfit dislocations in semi‐coherent oxide heterostructures and motivate future computational efforts.",

Twisted‐layered chiral metamaterials to connect optical properties between C4‐chirality and oligomers are described.

They exhibit ultra‐sharp circular dichroism in the near‐infrared region. The sharp circular dichroism is induced by interactions among layers in the metamaterials. Characteristics of the interactions are analyzed by considering electric field distribution profiles.

In the past decades, disease outbreaks due to such zoonotic pathogens have appeared with an accelerated rate, which calls for an urgent development of adaptive (smart) therapeutics. Here, a computational strategy is developed to adaptively evolve peptides that could selectively inhibit mutating S protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) of different SARS-CoV-2 viral strains from binding to their human host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Starting from suitable peptide templates, based on selected ACE2 segments (natural RBD binder), the templates are gradually modified by random mutations, while retaining those mutations that maximize their RBD-binding free energies. In this adaptive evolution, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the template-RBD complexes are iteratively perturbed by the peptide mutations, which are retained under favorable Monte Carlo decisions. The computational search will provide libraries of optimized therapeutics capable of reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infection on a global scale.",

Graphite is to a large extent thermodynamically unfavorable for sodium‐ion intercalation and thus limits advancement in Na‐ion batteries. In this work, a β‐phase arsenic‐phosphorus monolayer is studied, which has recently been predicted to have semiconducting behavior and to be dynamically stable. First‐principles calculations based on density functional theory are used to explore the role of β‐AsP monolayer as a negative electrode for Na‐ion batteries. Cohesive energy, phonon spectrum, and molecule dynamics simulations confirm the thermodynamic stability and the possibility of experimentally synthesizing this material. The Na‐ion adsorption‐energies are found to be high (&gt;−1.2 eV) on both sides (As‐ and P‐side). The ultra‐fast energy barriers for Na (0.046/0.053 V) over both sides imply high diffusion of Na‐ions on the surfaces of β‐AsP. During the evaluation of Na‐ion anode performance, the fully sodiated state is found to be Na 2 AsP, which yields a high theoretical‐specific capacity of 506.16 mAh g −1 and low average sodiation potential of 0.43 V versus Na/Na+.",

Here we present a detailed study of permalloy nanodisks to be used in alternative to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, as efficient heating agents that release heat via magnetic hysteresis. A micromagnetic modeling analysis is carried out to identify sizes and ac field parameters that maximize the specific loss power (SLP), guaranteeing the fulfillment of biophysical constraints (Hergt–Dutz limit) and vortex state at remanence (reduced agglomeration effects). The highest SLP (790 W g −1 ) is found for 100 nm diameter and 20 nm thickness nanodisks, excited at a frequency of 75 kHz. Further analysis elucidates the influence of magnetostatic interactions and local nanodisk‐field orientation on the SLP of nanodisk clusters, which originate from the deposition in target tissues. At high concentrations, magnetostatic interactions can lead to a reduction of 40–50% in the hysteresis losses. From thermal simulations, we finally demonstrate that in a murine model temperature increments comparable to that obtained in calorimetric measurements under quasi‐adiabatic conditions can be achieved only by using an order of magnitude larger dosage of nanodisks, due to blood perfusion effects.",

    "abstract": "As COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out in the US, public health authorities are gradually reopening the economy. To date, there is no consensus on a common approach among local authorities. Here, a high-resolution agent-based model is proposed to examine the interplay between the increased immunity afforded by the vaccine roll-out and the transmission risks associated with reopening efforts. The model faithfully reproduces the demographics, spatial layout, and mobility patterns of the town of New Rochelle, NY - representative of the urban fabric of the US. Model predictions warrant caution in the reopening under the current rate at which people are being vaccinated, whereby increasing access to social gatherings in leisure locations and households at a 1% daily rate can lead to a 28% increase in the fatality rate within the next three months. The vaccine roll-out plays a crucial role on the safety of reopening: doubling the current vaccination rate is predicted to be sufficient for safe, rapid reopening.",

A superconducting magnetic energy storage is used with IHPS model to improve the dynamic stability of the studied system. A single area power system is connected with IHPS model through a tie‐line to form a GHPS. In the GHPS, a thyristor‐controlled series controller and a unified power flow controller are associated with the tie‐line power flow control. In this work, electric vehicle is also connected as a load to both the IHPS and GHPS models. The output profile of the proposed SPBOA‐based PID controller of both models is compared with whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and quasi‐oppositional‐based WOA (QOWOA). The performance of IHPS and GHPS models are studied under the different load perturbations. The robustness analysis and frequency domain analysis in terms of Bode plot are also shown in favor of the SPBOA method.",

To date, the link between this hydraulic energy dissipation and respective hemolytic action in RBPs remains vastly unknown. In this study, computational fluid dynamics is applied to compute the hydraulic energy dissipation at 9 operating conditions in two RBPs (HM3: HeartMate 3; HVAD: HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device). Respective interrelations with hemolytic pump performance are elucidated by comparing these computations with in silico predicted and in vitro measured hemolysis. Despite different pump geometries, hydraulic loss magnitudes, and distributions, global hydraulic energy dissipation shows strong correlation ( r &gt; 0.95) to in vitro hemolysis with scaling factors in the same order of magnitude for both devices ( φ HM3 = 0.599 (mL g) (J 100L) –1 ; φ HVAD = 0.716 (mL g) (J 100L) –1 ). The analytical description of hydraulic energy dissipation reveals to be a function of shear stresses and exposure time, unmasking its analogy to the power‐law formulation of hemolysis. This hydraulics‐based analysis may denote a step ahead to relate turbomachinery to bioengineering and may provide mechanistic insights into the relation between RBP design, hydraulic properties, and hemolytic performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding and improving 3D printing process models are very important for designing building defect‐free 3D printers. Most studies have failed to present detailed process design and modeling of material extrusion (MatEx)‐based additive manufacturing (AM) in a systematic approach that considers all process parameters such as nozzle diameter, nozzle angle, and velocity. It is studied that the accuracy and consistency of a MatEx 3D fabricated product depend on the pressure drop across various nozzle zones. This paper identifies the constraints affecting the performance of the MatEx AM process and presents mathematical modeling related to various process parameters. Also, the paper shows expressions for pinch wheel feed mechanism, liquefier, and nozzle geometry of the MatEx process in terms of independent variables, such as liquefier temperature, nozzle geometry, and feed rate. This will be helpful in computing the precise design parameters of MatEx‐based 3D printers. The complex mathematical expressions developed are pivotal for the effective regulation of the 3D printing process. It not only provides new and better designs for MatEx machines with precise operation and better resolution but also opens the scope for further scientific development to expand the capability of proposed approach for both specific applications and the field.",

With the motivation of finding routes to engineer the band gap and the band alignment, while conserving or enhancing the ferroelectric properties, the thermodynamic, electronic, and ferroelectric properties of BiCo x Fe 1− x O 3 solid solutions ( x = 0, 0.0625, 0.125) using density functional theory are investigated. It is shown that the band gap can be reduced from 2.9 to 2.1 eV by cobalt substitution, while simultaneously increasing the spontaneous polarization, which is associated with a notably larger Born effective charge of Co compared to Fe cations. The interaction between Co impurities is discussed, which is strongly attractive and can drive the aggregation of Co, as evidenced by Monte Carlo simulations. Phase separation into a Co‐rich phase is therefore predicted to be thermodynamically preferred, and the homogenous solid solution can only exist in metastable form, protected by slow cation diffusion kinetics. Finally, the band alignment of pure and Co‐substituted BiFeO 3 with relevant redox potentials, in the context of its applicability in photocatalysis, is discussed.",

A system involving many such particles exhibits a variety of collective dynamics, such as the disordered gas, polar liquid, and active crystal states. We performed direct numerical simulations of a three-dimensional system containing many self-rotating particles to explicitly resolve the hydrodynamic interactions among rotating particles. The collective motion depends on the magnitude of the dipole moments induced on the dielectric particles, the area fraction of particles, and the strength of interparticle attraction. We find that the highly ordered polar liquid state is destabilized by the hydrodynamic interaction between rotating particles at high densities: the near-field lubrication interaction becomes dominant over far-field effects as the interparticle separation becomes shorter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To accurately analyze the fracture behavior of piezoceramics at small length scales, flexoelectricity must be considered along with piezoelectricity. Due to its dependence on size, flexoelectricity predominates at the micro‐ and nano‐length scales. Additionally, crack tips having the largest strain gradient state cause large flexoelectricity around them. Different approaches are employed in the past to model cracks computationally. However, extended isogeometric analysis (XIGA) is proven to be an accurate and efficient method. C 1 continuity requirements for modeling gradients in flexoelectricity are met by non‐uniform rational B‐splines (NURBS) basis functions used in XIGA. In this work, XIGA‐based computational model is developed and implemented to study the fracture behavior of the piezoelectric‐flexoelectric domain. An in‐house MATLAB code is developed for the same. Several numerical examples are studied to ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the implemented model, and crack behavior is presented in the form of an electro‐mechanical J‐integral. The analysis is carried out to investigate how cracks behave for different flexoelectric coefficients under different electrical and mechanical loading combinations. J‐integral is also analyzed against crack parameters such as crack orientation and length. It is observed that boundary loads and flexoelectric material constants significantly influence J‐integral. Results also show a considerable amount of fracture toughening in the presence of flexoelectricity. The peak value of J‐integral is found to be reduced with an increase in the flexoelectric coefficient. A significant reduction in J‐integral, as much as 45%, is observed when the flexoelectric constant varied from 0.5 to 2 µCm −1 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar energy offers a promising means of addressing energy supply and storage problems, but this potential is not fully realized due to a lack of suitable semiconducting materials. The discovery of new materials with desirable properties has historically been conducted either using an experimental or a first‐principles density functional theory based study. These approaches are extremely time‐intensive, and therefore, cannot be applied effectively to study a large number of systems. In such situations, machine learning can be used to make predictions about properties of new compounds from known data, providing a more efficient route to materials discovery. Here, this approach is used to predict the bandgap of a series of oxysulfide perovskites (of the form of ABO X S 3− X , X = 0,1,2,3), in general, and sulfur‐rich ABOS 2 , in particular. Atomic properties of constituent elements in the perovskite structures via 1.048 millions possible subsets of features are employed to train the models. Further, feature selection, kernel ridge regression, and k ‐nearest neighbors classification methods are applied to downselect the promising ABOS 2 based oxysulfide perovskites for water‐splitting. The accuracy of each model is determined using standard statistical metrics. Finally, seven stable but yet unsynthesized sulfur‐rich oxysulfide perovskites (BiInOS 2 , BiGaOS 2 , SbInOS 2 , SbGaOS 2 , SbAlOS 2 , SnZrOS 2 , and MgSnOS 2 ) that show potential for water‐splitting applications are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modeling and predicting battery cathode material voltage requires accurate structural information regarding the binding sites of lithium within a target structure. Obtaining these optimized structures requires some form of structural optimization. The ensuing complexity impedes the rapid screening of new materials for their suitability in energy storage. Previous machine learning (ML) models use structures of both lithiated and nonlithiated forms for training; essentially, reproducing what is already known, but failing to generalize to structures whose lithiated form is not available. To avoid this limitation, an ML model capable of predicting the voltage associated with the material's lithiation without explicitly requiring the lithiated structure is trained. The model's predictive power is improved by adding newly calculated data points, with the most impactful being materials with unfavorable Li binding, which are lacking in the original dataset. Using this model, new cathode candidates among an order of magnitude more materials than in previous studies are screened and the most promising ones are validated with density functional theory calculations. Considering additional stability and conductivity constraints, 572 materials with voltages greater than 3.5 V are predicted. Unexpectedly, some of them are not based on conventional transition metals, highlighting the power of an unbiased search.",

The effects of the thickness, bulk lifetime, resistivity, and selectivity of charge carriers due to the polysilicon passivated contact are investigated. Through such n‐polysilicon passivated contact, the back‐emitter solar cells engender higher internal power owing to enhanced surface passivation. This further reduces the shading loss due to front metallization; however, the reduced minority carrier lifetime of the p‐type Czochralski (Cz) wafer restricts the possibilities for high efficiency. Subsequently, the minority charge carrier lifetime of the p‐type wafer conceivably becomes an obstacle to realizing TOPCon solar cells with a high conversion efficiency. This study demonstrates that a configuration suitable for the industrial manufacturing of high‐efficiency solar cells is a crystalline silicon solar cell on a p‐type wafer through a rear‐emitter n‐polysilicon passivated contact.

One possible reason for such inefficiency is a high kinetic barrier for water oxidation, and there is a lack of direct and efficient method to calculate the barrier for each reaction. In this paper, the inner sphere component of the reorganization energy that contributed to the activation energies is calculated. A novel algorithm is used for calculating the reorganization energy based on Marcus theory combined with the climbing image nudged elastic band method used to find transition states and activation energies of the oxygen evolution reaction steps, which allows the calculation of the activation energy at different potentials and without simulating solvation in order to obtain the inner sphere component alone arising from the reorganization of the ionic surface. The new method is tested in both acidic and basic conditions and with explicit water molecules, as well as implicit solvation. It is discovered that the reaction involving the transition of the *O intermediate into *OOH has the highest activation energy of all steps, thus explaining the high coverage of the *O intermediate found by experiments.",

First, the BP method is applied to establish the nonlinear mapping relationship between process data and grading capacity, which is regarded as the capacity consistency prediction model. Second, using the prediction model as fitness function and combining with PSO algorithm, the optimization model of process parameters is established.

The results show that the BP method has an accurate capacity consistency prediction effect.

    "abstract": "Abstract The innovative lead‐free formamidinium tin‐based perovskite solar cell structure is considered nontoxic and potentially more stable than lead‐based, although its performance is not yet excellent. This research aims to enhance the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells and reduce the recombination losses. According to device modeling, the FASnI 3 perovskite solar cell demonstrates a packing conversion efficiency of 14.3% (open circuit voltage ( V oc ) = 0.899 V, fill factor (FF) = 58.9%, and current density ( J sc ) = 26.06 mA cm −2 ) by employing Bi hole transporting layers, a copper oxide, and crystalline silicon layers. Some features that affect the device include the thickness of each layer, the doping density of copper oxide and a silicon layer, and the back contact metalwork function. It is proposed that Bi‐HTL reduce the carriers to enter hole transport layer (HTL) as the doping change so that decreasing charge carriers recombination and enhancing the device efficiency in tin‐based perovskite solar cell with the structure of ITO/TiO 2 /FASnI 3 /CuO/Si/C. Furthermore, the impacts of various charge transport layers on energy band alignment, recombination, electric field, and IV properties are thoroughly explored.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Complex hierarchical metamaterials are currently the focus of many cutting‐edge studies due to their potential to advance such critically important areas of technology as energy storage and transformation, sensing, photovoltaics, nano‐medicine, antibacterial and self‐regenerating materials. However, the deterministic design of novel hierarchical metamaterials remains problematic due to the lack of efficient, highly reliable methods for controlling the internal structure and architecture of materials. A comprehensive advanced model is proposed to simulate the formation of complex hierarchical metamaterials with a controllable structure. The control is achieved via selective deposition of noble metal nanoparticles (Au, Au, Pd, Pt). Moreover, the novel method for the nanofabrication is theoretically examined and experimentally verified. This approach allows for the sophisticated spatiotemporal control of growth conditions and, as a result, achieving the targeted internal structure of metamaterials. This opens a way to the deterministic design and formation of complex multi‐material metamaterials on the basis of metal oxides and noble metal nanoparticles. Moreover, a fundamental insight related to the longstanding question about the prevalence of bottom‐up versus top‐down growth for various materials and systemswhich is challenging to directly verify experimentally is presented.",

However, due to the absence of an in situ characterization technique during the etching process, the complex chemical reactions involved in the process obscure the atomic‐scale etching mechanisms. In this paper, the etching mechanisms of diamond (001), graphite (0001), and amorphous carbon substrates irradiated by hydrogen plasmas are investigated and compared using molecular dynamics simulations based on ReaxFF. When the incident energy of H atoms is 1 eV, the rate of carbon loss from graphite and amorphous carbon are far higher than that from diamond. As the incident energy of H atoms increases, the etching rate of diamond shows a slow increase, while the etching rates of amorphous carbon and graphite exhibit more significant increases. It can be concluded that the etching rate of diamond is significantly lower than that of graphite and amorphous carbon under H plasma. In the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process of diamond growth, the generated graphite and amorphous carbon are rapidly etched, leaving only diamond. This offers a plausible explanation for the growth mechanism of diamond through CVD.",

The results show that when the outer ring defect of the bearing occurs, the axle box will generate high‐frequency vibration at the resonance peak in the vertical and lateral directions. When the defect on the bearing outer ring is in the small width of 1 mm, the roller only imposes one impact when passing through the defect area. However, when the width exceeds 3 mm, the large defect causes the roller to impose a double impact on the lateral direction of the axle box, due to changes in bearing clearance in the passing‐through process. When the running speed of the train is about 250 km h −1 , the width of bearing outer ring defects needs to be limited to within 1 mm, to minimize a series of problems such as structural fatigue caused by the increased bearing roller‐outer raceway contact load caused by bearing outer ring defects.",

The morphological phase diagram of the block copolymer is constructed for nanoparticles with chemical affinity ranging from A-compatible to B-compatible for a symmetric A-B diblock copolymer.

There have been different approaches to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of such systems, most of which are based on the low‐Reynolds‐number approximation of the surrounding flow field, also known as the Stokes flow. However, it has been long debated that the Stokes‐flow approach without corrections for hydrodynamic interactions is inadequate in explaining the dynamics of a particle, even a blunt sphere, following a non‐trivial path subject to spatial and temporal variations. A cargo being towed by a rotating helical tail presents an even more complicated problem which can only be appreciated by numerical solutions of time‐dependent Navier–Stokes equations incorporated with rigid‐body dynamics. In this study, such a solution scheme is presented for the six degrees of freedom motion of both bacteria and bacteria‐inspired micro‐robots, swimming in backward or forward direction. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to characterize the impedance coefficients via parameterized wave geometry. Thus, it is demonstrated that the resistive force theory can be improved to predict time‐dependent fluid resistance acting on bio‐inspired micro‐swimmers via hydrodynamic impedance‐based corrections, allowing accurate calculation of required power to achieve desired actuation strategies.",

It is shown how, by identifying the essential atomistic degrees of freedom in the solvation process, the adaptive technique can be used to devise an optimal strategy for studying the aggregation of two micelles with atomistic accuracy and at a reduced computational cost. Atomistic accuracy is highly desired in such studies; in fact, if any water‐mediated effect that requires the explicit hydrogen bond network is present, then the adaptive resolution will be able to describe it. Instead, this is not possible if a generic coarse‐grained model, for example, spherical molecules without orientational bonds, is employed. In particular, the potential of mean force for the aggregation of two micelles is calculated and it is shown that the results obtained agree in a satisfactory way with the full atomistic simulation of reference. In perspective, this paper offers an example of how similar systems/problems can be efficiently treated with the adaptive resolution technique.",

Here, negative differential resistance (NDR) devices based on atomically precise graphene nanoribbons are investigated. The computational evaluation of the traditional double‐barrier resonant‐tunneling diode NDR structure uncovers important issues at the atomic scale, concerning the need to minimize the tunneling current between the leads while achieving high peak current. A new device structure consisting of multiple short segments that enables high current by the alignment of electronic levels across the segments while enlarging the tunneling distance between the leads is proposed. The proposed structure can be built with atomic precision using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip during an intermediate stage in the synthesis of an armchair nanoribbon. An experimental evaluation of the band alignment at the interfaces and an STM image of the fabricated active part of the device are also presented. This combined theoretical–experimental approach opens a new avenue for the design of nanoscale devices with atomic precision.",

Dynamic simulation and modeling can yield an insight into the detailed conformational, dynamical, and transport properties of soft matter systems, which is necessary to understand the transport properties of biological macromolecules in living organisms. As a mesoscopic particles‐based simulation technique, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) has quickly been adopted as a promising approach for simulating dynamic and rheological properties of simple and complex fluids as well as the events taking place inside the fluidic channels. Here, the DPD method widely used in predicting the channel flow containing various soft matter systems is reviewed. The general aspect and basic formulations of DPD are introduced, and different boundary conditions are presented for wall‐bounded flows. In addition, the models based on DPD developed to simulate flow‐induced transport through fluidic channels for some typical soft matter systems are discussed, including red blood cells, vesicles, polymers, and biomacromolecules. Finally, the future directions to signify the framework in enhancing the design of novel functional systems and beyond are discussed.",

Although the generation and detection of OAM in free space is well investigated, further extensions to near‐filed surface plasmon polariton (SPP) would be crucial for miniaturing and integrating platforms. Here, based on spin‐orbit interaction, a general scheme for near‐filed generating and detecting OAM modes is numerically and theoretically demonstrated. Utilizing the proposed design scheme, SPP OAM modes with optional topological charges can be achieved, which offers a new approach to generate near‐field OAM modes. To characterize the physical mechanism of spin‐orbit interaction, an improved dipole model is established for the first time, from what is known, with which the numerical results are well reproduced. Moreover, with elaborately design, the OAM generators can be developed into a compact OAM detector. Such a device owns the capacity of simultaneously discriminating the sign, the topological charge and the helicity of the incident OAM beam via a single measurement. These results provide a general method for near‐field OAM generation and detection, indicating promising applications in optical communication, particle trapping, and integrated photonic circuits.",

This stress plays a dominant role in the mechanical, optical, magnetic, and thermal properties of nanocomposites. Here, the interfacial structure evolution and atomistic origin of intrinsic residual stress are figured out through the in situ characterization of atom arrangement and rearrangement in layered metallic nanocomposites with different interfacial misfit by using an atomistic approach. It is found that with the increment of the interfacial misfit, the interface roughens while the intrinsic residual stress increases and then reduces. The film structure dominates the evolution of interfacial structure and intrinsic residual stress when the interfacial misfit is low, whereas the effect of substrate structure on the interface and the stress is as important as the film structure with the increase of the interfacial misfit. The work demonstrates how the film structures affect the interfacial structure and intrinsic stress in layered metallic nanocomposites. Both the film and substrate structures should be taken into consideration to design layered composites with excellent properties.",

A database of small and relatively rigid compounds containing nitrogen atoms is compiled. Scaling factors for the linear correlation between experimental 15 N chemical shifts and calculated isotropic shielding constants are systematically investigated with seven different levels of theory in both chloroform and dimethyl sulfoxide, two commonly used solvents for NMR experiments. The best method yields a root‐mean‐square deviation of about 5.30 and 7.00 ppm in CHCl 3 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. Moreover, another set of scaling factors for –NH 2 chemical shifts is also proposed based on a separate database with three levels of theory. Furthermore, it is encouraging that a reasonable transferability for the linear correlation is found between these two solvents. This finding will enable broader applications of the developed empirical scaling factors to other commonly used solvents in NMR experiments.

Using an analytical/computational framework, the connectivity landscape of various shapes of colloidal molecules is examined to propose new multicomponent superstructure phases that can self‐assemble from binary mixtures of these building blocks. The identified superstructures are then investigated in terms of their tunable photonic/phononic properties. The dependence of photonic bandgaps on various features of the superstructures such as building block size and shape is studied. Each superstructure is composed of at least four different types of elements, which provides a desirable framework to obtain reconfigurable metamaterials. The calculations show that a binary superstructure of tetrahedral units can result in photonic bandgaps with sizes as large as 27% for material compositions with dielectric constant difference of 15. The new superstructures formed by colloidal molecules expand the existing self‐assembly paradigms for colloidal particles.

The permselectivities obtained by using the CGD‐MD method accurately predict that ZIF‐8 is H 2 selective over CO 2 and N 2 . On the other hand, permselectivities predicted with the GCMC+EMD approach are found to be incorrect, that is, ZIF‐8 not selective for H 2 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Exfoliation is a common route to synthesize 2D materials such as monolayered and few‐layered nanosheets. However, it is not easy to control the breaking‐down process. This work shows a new exfoliation strategy for generation of nanosheets from soft layered composites in high yield. Soft layered composites of inorganic hosts and organic guests are exfoliated into nanosheets in organic dispersion media. A simple yield prediction model is constructed on small‐scale experimental data by sparse modeling, a data‐scientific approach, combined with chemical perspective. The prediction model indicates the guest–medium combinations enabling high‐ and low‐yield syntheses of the nanosheets. The high‐ and low‐yield syntheses are actually achieved on different types of layered transition metal oxides in a minimum number of experiments. The number of experiments is reduced by 94%. The experimental optimization realizes further improvement of the yield, namely, shortening the exfoliation time. The present strategies can be applied to obtain a variety of 2D materials through exfoliation. Moreover, the present work suggests that combination of small experimental data, data‐scientific approach, and chemical perspective, i.e., experiment‐oriented materials informatics, has potentials for acceleration of materials design.",

Such simulations, however, are computationally demanding and cannot be reasonably applied to large systems containing more than a hundred atoms. Here, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to accelerate the calculation of high accuracy atomic forces and energies used during such MD simulations. After carefully training a robust ANN for four and five element systems, nearly identical lithium ion diffusivities are obtained for Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 (LGPS) when benchmarking the ANN‐MD results with DFT‐MD. Applying the ANN‐MD approach, the effect of chlorine doping on the lithium diffusivity is calculated in an LGPS‐like structure and it is found that a dopant concentration of 1.3% maximizes ionic conductivity. The optimal concentration balances the competing consequences of effective atomic radii and dielectric constants on lithium diffusion and agrees with the experimental composition. Performing simulations at the resolution necessary to model experimentally relevant and optimal concentrations would be infeasible with traditional DFT‐MD. Systems that require a large number of simulated atoms can be studied more efficiently while maintaining high accuracy with the proposed ANN‐MD framework.",

Here, approaches for in silico solubility predictions based on atomistic models are evaluated. A computationally efficient atomistic simulation procedure based on the concept of inherent structures is proposed for statistical sampling of polymer conformations. Comprehensive test simulations of several polymers and common solvents confirm the accuracy of the procedure for calculation of physicochemical properties such as cohesive energy densities, which along with the Hansen solubility parameters and the Flory–Huggins (FH) theory facilitate rapid, qualitative solubility predictions. However, the FH theory fails to model specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Therefore, more accurate predictions are obtained employing the perturbed hard sphere chain (PHSC) equation of state (EOS). As test case, aqueous poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions revealing strong hydrogen bonding are used. The physicochemical properties including the PEO‐water phase diagram calculated by the PHSC EOS show good agreement with experimental observations. Consequently, the combination of qualitative predictions using the FH theory for rapid prescreening with computationally more demanding parameterization of the PHSC EOS provides a promising tool for in silico solubility predictions with potential applications in nanomedicine.",

Ultra‐thin coated cathode particles, fabricated via atomic layer deposition (ALD), exhibit superior battery performance over that of bare particles. Therefore, it is generally believed that a coating layer protects the particles from metal dissolution of active materials, which is a critical cathode degradation mechanism. However, it is observed that ultra‐thin CeO 2 coating intensified the Mn dissolution of LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) during cycling of LIBs, whereas ultra‐thin Al 2 O 3 coating tended to inhibit Mn dissolution. A detailed density functional theory (DFT) study is carried out to explain these experimental observations by analyzing interaction of Mn atoms with neighboring electrode atoms in terms of energetic and structural aspect. All atomic and electronic analyses are consistent with the experimental observations. Several common materials are investigated as possible ALD coatings for LIBs to provide general insight, and it is found that Mn dissolution can be suppressed or accelerated depending on the material selection. This is the first report finding that depending on the coating material, metal dissolution can be accelerated, providing new insights into the impact of ALD coating materials on metal dissolution in cathode materials.",

Inverse design of the popular class of transparent conducting oxide (TCO)‐based active metasurfaces is particularly challenging, largely due to the limited choice of the active materials, and sensitive physical mechanisms that give rise to their tunability. In this contribution, a new machine learning method based on a combination of the K‐means clustering algorithm and conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (cWGANs) for broadband multi‐modal inverse design of TCO‐based active metasurfaces is developed. Multi‐objective evolutionary optimization is adopted to efficiently generate a diverse training dataset of high‐performance active metasurfaces. The training dataset includes samples that operate at specific wavelengths throughout the optical telecommunications (telecom) band. K‐means algorithm is then used to extract the clusters (modes) present in the training dataset, and exclusive cWGAN models are fit on each of them. The model is capable of generating designs operating at wavelengths that are not present in the training dataset. It also provides a clear picture of the feasibility and interplay between the design objectives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Calcium ion batteries are gaining attention as alternatives to lithium‐ion technology because they offer comparable properties at reduced cost and improved safety. However, progress has been limited because of the inability to efficiently and reversibly plate and strip Ca metal anodes in organic electrolytes. Moreover, the inorganic components of the solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) that form via decomposition of the electrolyte often do not allow for the diffusion of Ca ions. In this work, an approach combining density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations is utilized to show that the use of a preformed artificial SEI layer of amorphous can potentially prevent electrolyte decomposition. First, Ca is shown to be able to intercalate into an amorphous layer (up to Ca 1.5 Al 2 O 3 ) and diffuse through on a reasonable time scale. Through calculation of the density of states, the system is found to remain insulating up to the equilibrium stoichiometry. Finally, AIMD simulations with a realistic organic electrolyte environment are used to show that this calcinated layer completely prevents the decomposition of solvent molecules. This approach can provide a route to efficient rechargeable Ca ion batteries, paving the way for cheap large‐scale energy storage.",

It is determined that the machinability of SiC ceramics can be effectively improved by UVAM. The machining‐induced damage extent of poly‐SiC is more serious than that of mono‐SiC. It is also found that UVAM can effectively reduce the machining‐induced damage, decrease the machining resistance, and increase the possibility of ductile removal, but bring about a slightly larger tool wear.",

This study explores the hydration water ordering and its temperature and length‐scale dependencies for type‐III AFPs, and the results with hyperactive AFP and non‐AFPs are compared. The hydration layer of the IBS of globular AFP is semiclathrate‐like, which is different from the hyperactive AFPs, as it is reported to be ice‐like. In a similar environment, the solvation water surrounding the non‐ice‐binding surface (non‐IBS) is mostly liquid‐like. Surprisingly, the non‐IBS is appreciably dissimilar from the non‐AFP in terms of hydration pattern. The amino acid compositions of the non‐IBS are in contrast with the IBS. Protein–water hydrogen bonding patterns between the IBS and non‐IBS of AFP are also different. These consequences suggest the collective function of non‐IBS and IBS in the antifreeze activity. The different nature of the first solvation shell water ordering around the IBS of type‐III AFP and hyperactive insect AFP implicates a differential design of IBS that may account for their observed difference in antifreeze activity.",

To establish the battery online parameters, the forgetting factor recursive least square (FFRLS) technique is utilized, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are employed to estimate accurate SOC. Compared to the EKF/UKF method, the joint algorithm (FFRLS‐UKF) approach produces better results. The results are validated using the urban dynamometer driving schedule cycle and the ECE extra‐urban driving cycle (low powered vehicles) to determine the performance of the proposed algorithm. The error of the estimated SOC has fallen from 3.3% to 2%. The proposed adaptive joint algorithm has substantially improved the system's accuracy and provides better results than the EKF/UKF technique. Furthermore, the random variable noise is also supplied to the test data to ensure that the proposed method is robust.",

A six‐degree‐of‐freedom magneto‐hydrodynamic model is developed based on the resistive force theory (RFT) to predict the response of robots swimming through different fluids and examine their response during transitions into Newtonian–viscoelastic interfaces. Performance of the robot, while swimming in a fluid with a fixed viscosity, is quantified using sensitivity analysis based on the magneto‐hydrodynamic model. The numerical results show how abrupt changes in viscosity can affect their ability to rotate with the rotating field in synchrony. The sensitivity analysis shows that the states of the robot are mostly sensitive to variations in the actuation frequency. Open‐loop experiments are performed using a permanent‐magnet robotic system comprising a robotic arm and a rotating permanent magnet to actuate and control a helical robot at the Newtonian–Viscoelastic interface and validate the theoretical predictions of the RFT‐based sensitivity analysis.",

Traditional methods have some shortages regarding the estimation time and running efficiency. Consequently, the AQI results cannot meet the needs of personal protection and environmental management. With the popularity of smart terminals, it is easier to collect particular environmental images for AQI estimation tasks. Therefore, a real‐time and image‐based deep learning model named YOLO‐AQI is proposed. Based on the object detection algorithms, the model has better performance regarding the AQI estimation speed. By optimizing the parameter transfer and network structure, the model takes an average of 0.0582 s to perform feature analysis and achieves 75.15% accuracy on AQI estimation tasks. Comparing YOLO‐AQI with several image recognition models (VGG, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, and ResNet), it shows that YOLO‐AQI outperforms other models by 14.8% on accuracy and by 71.1% on running speed. This method can provide real‐time AQI level information for remote areas such as rural.",

Then, this new method is successfully used to simulate the pitting processes in the cases of a uniform matrix, a polycrystalline matrix, and a non‐uniform matrix with secondary phase for aluminum alloys.

The morphology has a strong influence on the performance of the final device but unfortunately, the process–structure relationship is often poorly and only qualitatively understood. This is because many different physical mechanisms (miscibility, evaporation, crystallization, diffusion, and advection) are active at potentially different time scales and because the kinetics plays a crucial role: the morphology develops until it is kinetically quenched far from equilibrium. In order to unravel the various possible structure formation pathways, a unified theoretical framework that takes into account all these physical phenomena is proposed. This phase‐field simulation tool is based on the Cahn–Hilliard equations for diffusion and the Allen–Cahn equation for crystallization and evaporation, which are coupled to the equations for the dynamics of the fluid. The behavior of the coupled model based on simple test cases is discussed and verified. Furthermore, how this framework allows to investigate the morphology formation in a drying film undergoing evaporation‐induced LLPS and crystallization, which is typically a situation encountered, is illustrated, for example, in organic photovoltaics applications.",

Motivated by this, we have used density functional theory (DFT) simulations to explore the potential applications of green phosphorene monolayer (GPM) as efficient nanobio‐sensor. We have employed van der Waals induced calculations to study the ground‐state geometries, binding strength, electronic structures, and charge transfer mechanism of pristine, vacancy‐induced and metal‐doped GPM to detect the selected AAs, such as glycine, proline and aspartic, in both aqueous and non‐aqueous media. We find that the interactions of studied AAs are comparatively weak on pristine (−0.49 to −0.76 eV) and vacancy‐induced GPM as compared to the metal‐doped GPM (−0.62 to −1.22 eV). Among the considered dopants, Ag‐doping enhances the binding of AAs to the GPM stronger than the others. In addition to appropriate binding energies, significant charge transfers coupled with measurable changes in the electronic properties further authenticate the potential of GPM. Boltzmann thermodynamic analysis have been used to study the sensing mechanism under varied conditions of temperatures and pressure for the practical applications. Our findings signify the potential of GPM based sensors towards efficient detection of the selected AAs.",

We developed a scheme that can identify which peaks are relavant to what extent by using auto-encoder technique to construct a feature space for the XRD peak patterns. Individual XRD patterns are projected onto a single point in the two-dimensional feature space constructed using the method. If the point is significantly shifted when a peak of interest is masked, then we can say the peak is relevant for the characterization represented by the point on the space. In this way, we can formulate the relevancy quantitatively. By using this scheme, we actually found such a peak with a significant peak intensity but low relevancy in the characterization of the structure. The peak is not easily explained by the physical viewpoint such as the higher-order peaks from the same plane index, being a heuristic finding by the power of machine-learning.",

The cycl[3,3,3]azine is a multiple resonance effect (MRE)‐like TADF fluorescent compound, with narrow NIR emission, inverted singlet‐triplet gaps, and low molecular weight, which is an ideal platform for biological applications.

In addition, a connection to periodic systems is made applying the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE)/Green's function many‐body perturbation theory () approach to a selected system. It is found that the brightest excitons are dominated by local excitations. The energetic location of charge transfer states in the electronic spectra of aggregates depends to a large extent on a given method and distance between nearest neighbors.

Here, through in silico experiments, in vivo tests are mimicked on a 30 g mouse and a 500 g rat, with the aim of determining the optimal treatment conditions allowing to reach the therapeutic temperature range (40−45 °C) within tumor regions. Various types of MNPs are considered with very different heating properties in terms of specific loss power, varying their administered dose, as well as the frequency and peak amplitude of the magnetic field. The analysis is performed by means of finite element models that solve the low‐frequency electromagnetic (EM) field problem and the Pennes’ bioheat transfer equation, to calculate the temperature increase in biological tissues due to the combined effects of EM field exposure and MNP activation. The methodology, which can be generalized to any type of MNPs, has permitted to identify the proper doses of MNPs to be administered to the tumor region, as a function of their heating properties and magnetic field parameters, highlighting the conditions that can lead to possible overheating, generation of hot spots or magnetic hyperthermia inefficacy.",

To address this problem, a method to automatically expand the dataset for deep learning models with fewer original images is developed. A defect detection method is also presented, YOLOv7‐EAS, that enhances YOLOv7 for camera module images with complex backgrounds and small target defects. This method introduces NewEIOU Loss, a bounding box regression loss function that extends EIOU Loss with a nonlinear compensation term. This function improves the model's convergence rate to quadratic order. Moreover, the detection head based on ASFF is redesigned to adapt the layer features and spatially filter out irrelevant information to improve the detection rate of small targets. Finally, a 3D attention mechanism is applied to increase the model's ability to extract fine‐grained features without increasing the network parameters. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv7 algorithm achieves 90.5% mAP for the camera module image dataset, which is 10.7% higher than the original algorithm, at 136 FPS. This method can perform the camera module surface defect detection task more accurately and meet the real‐time requirements of the production line.",

The additional role of the dynamic electronic polarization effects neglected in standard DFT calculations is also discussed. Interestingly, whereas the HOMO energy varies significantly among the unsubstituted oligomers in the gas phase, their alignment with respect to the Fermi level of the electrode is almost insensitive to chain size upon chemisorption, thus pointing to a strong pinning effect.

The typical development of molecular simulation software is initially inspired by a particular scientific inquiry. The softwares presented herein, MPMC (Massively Parallel Monte Carlo) and MCMD (Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics) were born out of a pursuit to simulate condensed phase physical and chemical interactions in porous materials. MPMC first began in 2005 and has been used for dozens of published results in the literature but has not yet been introduced in a standalone paper. MCMD is a more recent expansion and re‐write with some published work, focused on adding molecular dynamics algorithms for transport and other time‐dependent properties of chemical systems. Each software functions as a standalone with some unique and other overlapping features. A driving aim of this work is to consider periodic, long‐range polarization effects in classical simulation, and both codes are optimized to perform such calculations. Sample results will be presented which highlight methodically that inclusion of explicit polarization produces simulation results with predictive power which in general are in greater agreement with experiment than non‐polarizable analogous simulations.",

Intriguingly, this work shows that the concept of stress intensity factor is still valid if the atoms are modeled. Molecular statistics simulations are conducted on single‐edge cracked samples of ideal brittle silicon, varying the size until few nanometers. The local virial stress, derived as the functional derivative of the free energy of a molecular system with respect to the deformation tensor, is used as a measure of the mechanical stress at the atomic level. Then, stress intensity factor at failure is evaluated. The results show that regardless of the size, the atomistic stress field varies according to the classical 1/ r 0.5 relation, and discrete stress intensity factors can be derived for all the geometries. Continuum values, in contrast, fail to describe the fracture when the length of the singular stress field is smaller than 4–5 times the fracture process zone. Thus, this work shows that the stress intensity factor from atomic stress may be useful to describe the fracture criterion at extremely small dimensions, provided that virial stress is accepted as a representation of mechanical stress at the atomic level.",

This approach naturally involves the study of the binding properties of highly heterogeneous ligands. Such datasets challenge computational techniques to provide comparable binding free energy estimates from different binding modes. The performance of a range of statistically robust ensemble-based binding free energy calculation protocols, called ESMACS (enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics with approximation of continuum solvent), is evaluated. Ligands designed to target two binding pockets in the lactate dehydogenase, a target protein, which vary in size, charge, and binding mode, are studied. When compared to experimental results, excellent statistical rankings are obtained across this highly diverse set of ligands. In addition, three approaches to account for entropic contributions are investigated: 1) normal mode analysis, 2) weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS), and 3) variational entropy. Normal mode analysis and WSAS correlate strongly with each other-although the latter is computationally far cheaper-but do not improve rankings. Variational entropy corrects exaggerated discrimination of ligands bound in different pockets but creates three outliers which reduce the quality of the overall ranking.",

This study addresses the phenomenology of cell–implant interfaces based on experimental, theoretical, and numerical analysis of cell response to functionalized bioceramic coatings of commercial titanium implants, cp‐Ti. A variable spectrum of coatings having differing surface wettabilities, with optimized solid tension values, is obtained. Measured values are modeled and correlated to cell support ability and viabilities. The contributions of different surface aspects to cell viability are decoupled, resulting in the identification of the polar component of the surface free energy as a significant and major cell–substrate effector. Furthermore, results of this study and the suggested model establish the thermodynamic interfacial free energy as an omnipotent measure that can be fully correlated to the morphology of an individual cell under numerical simulation matching empirical observations. Collectively, the 3D model reported herein can offer a new generic theoretical framework, using implementable mathematical simulation, toward the objective of rational biomaterial design that can improve next‐generation metal and ceramic implants.",

However, these materials suffer from problems of poor thermal and chemical stability with significant dissipative losses under high‐temperature conditions. In this regard, semiconductor nanoparticles have attracted attention with their promising characteristics of highly tunable plasmonic resonances, low ohmic losses, and greater thermochemical stability. Here, the size‐dependent thermoplasmonic properties of semiconducting silicon and gallium arsenide nanoparticles are investigated to compare them with Au nanoparticles using Mie theory. To this end, experimentally estimated models of dielectric permittivity are employed. Among the various permittivity models for Au, the Drude–Lorentz (DL) and the Drude and critical points (DCP) models are further compared. Results show a redshift in the scattering and absorption resonances for the DL model while the DCP model presents a blueshift. A massive Drude broadening contributes strongly to the damping of resonances in Au nanoparticles at elevated temperatures. In contrast, the semiconductor nanoparticles do not exhibit significant deterioration in their scattering and absorption resonances at high temperatures. In combination with low dissipative damping, this makes the semiconductor nanoparticles better suited for high‐temperature applications in nanoplasmonics wherein the noble metals suffer from excessive heating.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Charge separation (CS) is a central process in the working of organic solar cells (OSC). Despite the strong electron–hole (e–h) Coulombic attraction at the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface, the bound e–h pairs do separate into free charges following an ultrafast process. To explain these results, several models have been proposed. By means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the energy bending (EB) at the D–A interface is considered as the driving force for CS against the impact of energy disorder. The results suggest that, while entropy and energy disorder alone allow for the bound e–h pairs to escape charger recombination, the efficiency of CS increases by several times and its timescale decreases significantly in the presence of EB, approaching experimental findings. The impact of external electric fields on CS efficiency is found to stem from insufficient amount of EB. Importantly, the results indicate that, in the absence of EB, simply improving charge carrier mobility in bulk has no effect on the performances of OSC, thus orienting the new materials design strategy toward preferably targeting interfacial properties. Guidelines regarding how to introduce EB at the D–A interface are also discussed.",

It is proved that in the crystalline domains of conducting polymers, due to the strong electrostatic interactions between free charge carriers and counterions, the power factor within a wide range of doping level is governed by the counterion‐induced electronic scattering. It is corroborated that in the polycrystalline domains, although the short mean free path prevents the holes undergoing grain‐boundary scatterings, the crystallite orientations relative to the conduction path and the grain sizes strongly affect the power factor, leading to the modulation of the power factor by at least two orders of magnitude.",

The lack of such a framework is due to limitations in the methods for studying nanowire meshes, in particular the lack of knowledge on the spatial distribution of the nanowires and the change of their position under strain. This hurdle is overcome by collecting 3D reconstructed X‐ray tomographies of silver nanowires embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) under variable deformations and the missing structural information of the nanomaterial is obtained by unsupervised artificial intelligence image analysis. This allowed to reveal the precise assembly mechanisms of nanowire systems and derive a precise analytical formula for the piezoresistive response of the composite and finally to simulate the behavior of arbitrary samples in‐silico.",

However, the metasurface as a diffractive device usually suffers from chromatic aberrations, which greatly hinders the design freedom at different wavelengths. In this work, it is demonstrated that this limitation can be overcome by a multifunctional metasurface with completely independent phase modulations at three arbitrarily wavelengths. Specifically, a novel single‐layer tri‐spectral meta‐atom composed of three alternatively arranged slot and metallic resonators is proposed to operate at three distinct wavelengths, where 2π geometric phase modulations under the circularly polarized incidence can be achieved independently by rotating the corresponding resonators. As proof of concept demonstrations, a tri‐wavelength vortex beam generator and a meta‐hologram are designed to verify the proposed method. First, a vortex beam generator with arbitrary topological charge numbers at three wavelengths is designed and verified through theoretical calculation and full‐wave simulation. Moreover, a meta‐hologram generated by the computer‐generated holography is designed to display three frequency selective holographic images on the same image plane. The tri‐wavelength meta‐hologram is validated through theoretical calculation, full‐wave simulation, and experiment. The experimental results agree very well with the numerical ones, demonstrating the attractive capabilities of multifunctionalities at three wavelengths.",

For example, transition‐metal and rare‐earth oxides that can tolerate a large number of oxygen vacancies, such as CeO 2 and doped CeO 2 , can split water and carbon dioxide via a two‐step, oxide‐based solar thermochemical (STC) cycle. The search for new STC materials with a performance superior to that of state‐of‐the‐art CeO 2 can benefit from predictions accurately describing the thermodynamics of oxygen vacancies. The sub‐lattice formalism, a common tool used to fit experimental data and build temperature‐composition phase diagrams, can be useful in this context. Here, sub‐lattice models are derived solely from zero‐temperature quantum mechanics calculations to estimate fairly accurate temperature‐ and oxygen‐partial‐pressure‐dependent off‐stoichiometries in CeO 2 and Zr‐doped CeO 2 . Physical motivations for deriving some of the “excess” sub‐lattice model parameters directly from quantum mechanical calculations, instead of fitting to minimize deviations from experimental and/or theoretical data, are identified. Important limitations and approximations of the approach used are specified and extensions to multi‐cation oxides are also suggested to help identify novel candidates for water and carbon dioxide splitting and related applications.",

A compositional analysis for the simulated systems is also applied to monitor the possible intermediate products during its decomposition and dehydrogenation processes. At around 1000 K, the molecular hydrogen is released via inter‐molecular interaction between B‐H and N‐H. It is also noticed that the formed NH 3 and BH 3 can react to generate BN bonds; as the temperature further increases, the isomers with a skeleton of BNB are observed, and the corresponding dehydrogenation is also increased.

Here, the activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in zinc and nitrogen codoped graphene with different zinc–nitrogen (Zn–N) coordination numbers and configurations are studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculation results show that both Zn–N coordination numbers and structure configurations affect the activities of ORR and OER on ZnN x sites. Among all the calculated structures, ZnN 4 ‐pyridine shows the lowest ORR overpotential of 0.61 V, whereas ZnN 4 ‐pyrrole and ZnN 4 ‐edge show lower OER overpotentials of 0.73 and 0.63 V, respectively. However, the other low N coordination structures of ZnN x ‐pyridine/pyrrole/edge ( x = 1/0/1–3) demonstrate poor activities. The electronic structure reveals that the O‐p orbital shows moderate hybridization strength with the N‐p and Zn‐d orbitals in O adsorbed ZnN 4 systems thus facilitates the electrocatalytic reactions. The findings shed light on the rational design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photonic propulsion of light sails using the radiation pressure of an intense laser beam is a promising route to achieve relativistic velocities for deep space exploration. A successful photonic design of such relativistic sails requires efficient acceleration and maintaining stability of the beam‐riding across a Doppler‐broadened propulsion band due to considerable red‐shift of the wavelength in the frame of the moving sail. While efficient acceleration of the sail requires maximizing the optical force along the beam propagation direction, the stability degree of the sail depends on the magnitude of lateral forces in the transverse plane of the beam. This establishes a trade‐off between these two requirements which calls for their synergistic engineering. In this work, an evolutionary multi‐objective optimization technique for the inverse design of diffractive relativistic meta‐sails with a genetic pixelated geometry is adopted. The goal is to identify a set of Pareto optimal solutions which provides the designer with an intuitive understanding of the ultimate trade‐off between acceleration and stability degree of the sail in a vast design space, and allows for a well‐informed decision on the best design given the requirements for the acceleration time and distance as well as the tolerance with respect to mispointings and misalignments.",

By utilizing the brittle cleavage and plastic slip modes, the deformation mechanism is tracked and mechanical properties of precipitate/matrix and precipitate/precipitate heterophase interfaces are induced in third‐generation Al‐Li alloys, including δ'(Al 3 Li)/α‐Al, θ'(Al 2 Cu)/α‐Al, and δ'(Al 3 Li)/θ'(Al 2 Cu) (depending on the ultrafine δ'/θ'/δ' composite precipitate). Based on bond energy and ideal stress calculations under tensile and shear deformations, it is noted that the universal interface separating the two phases is not the weakest link in these systems. In δ'/θ'/δ', specifically, the defined coherent interface I closing to the δ' may become a weak cracking point under tensile loading. Whereas, the semi‐coherent interface II on the edge of the δ'/θ'/δ' tends to undergo interplanar slip along the [001] direction at relatively low shear stress. By releasing a partial dislocation under shear deformation, the local stable stacking fault can occur in this semi‐coherent interface. And the interface‐mediated plasticity within the ultrafine δ'/θ'/δ' composite precipitate could be expected to solve the origin of the strength‐ductility conflict in modern Al‐Li alloys. Besides, the electronic structures and atomic bonding are performed to reveal the mechanism behind the improved interface strength.",

This work conducted CO 2 ‐EGR simulations in a heterogeneous gas reservoir by using isothermal and non‐isothermal models and systematically analyzed the effects of various CO 2 injection parameters on natural gas recovery, CO 2 storage, and their comprehensive benefits. The results indicate that the CO 2 injection well should be perforated in the lower position, whose overlaid layers with low permeability hinder the upward migration of CO 2 , and the larger natural gas recovery and CO 2 storage can be achieved simultaneously for better comprehensive benefits. The optimal injection rate is 137.29 m 3 ·d −1 to achieve the highest recovery factor of 64.87%. The decrease in injection temperature and the increase in injection pressure are averse to the enhancement of recovery but beneficial to larger CO 2 storage. The comprehensive benefits of natural gas recovery and CO 2 storage are insensitive to the change of injection pressure and temperature, despite that every single one of them is more subjective to injection pressure than temperature. It's hoped that the findings of this work provide some theoretical guidance for the application of CO 2 ‐EGR.",

The active control of defects in these devices is becoming more important, especially since the electrodes used to manipulate them are shrinking to nanometer length scales. In this paper, a simple subwavelength, 1D, interdigitated metal electrode structure that can be reconfigured using nematic liquid crystals aligned in the homeotropic, planar, and hybrid methods are demonstrated. Accurate electro‐optic modeling of the directors and the defects are shown, which are induced by the fringing electric fields. Applied voltages result in liquid crystal reorientation near the bottom surface, such that defects are induced between the electrodes. The height of the electrodes does not affect the lateral position of these defects. Rather, this can be achieved by increasing the biasing voltage on the top electrode, which also leads to greater splay‐bend in the bulk of the material. These results therefore aim to generalize the control of defects in complex anisotropic nematic liquid crystals using simple interdigitated structures for a range of reconfigurable intelligent surface applications.",

Compared with other Cu‐related defects, this configuration introduces the weakest tensile stress around the defects and the slightest distortion of the metal octahedron. Owing to the special Cu Ag defect, the electronic structures of Cs 2 AgSbCl 6 system change, e.g., the bandgap reduces manifestly, ascribing to the predominant contribution from Cu‐3d orbitals to the band edges. With the increase of concentration of Cu dopants, the bandgap of Cs 2 AgSbCl 6 decreases further in a monotonic but gentle way, originating from the extra interactions between the Cu‐3d orbitals. Therefore, the critical insight to understand the photoelectronic properties of Cs 2 AgSbCl 6 modulated by the Cu dopants is provided.",

Using computational chemistry methods, the structural, adsorptive, and electronic properties of selected diatomic air pollutants (CO, NO, and SO) on B N ‐BNNT (8,0), with a particular focus on the antisites, are investigated. It is found that CO adsorbs on B N with 180° angle (∠B N CO) while NO and SO adsorb with 142° angle (∠B N NO) and 116° angle (∠B N SO), respectively. This difference is ascribed to the repulsive interaction originated from lone pair electrons on N and S. Adsorption energy of CO, NO, and SO molecules dominates over that of O 2 and N 2 and is independent of their radii of B N ‐BNNTs. The practical capacity of these pollutant molecules is calculated to be ≈5 mmol g –1 (14 wt%) under ambient conditions. Therefore, our results show that B N ‐BNNT can be used as a highly selective adsorbent for diatomic air pollutants.

A growing trend is the use of stochastic solvers (e.g., kinetic Monte Carlo), but care should be taken upon inputting and outputting distributed data for the populations involved. In the present contribution, several procedures and guidelines are formulated facilitating such data treatment. The solutions are exemplified through polymerization and polymer modification case studies, taking the molar mass or chain length as core stochastic variable. It is shown that rediscretization is often necessary, as experimentally measured distributions are not directly interpretable at the input side of stochastic solvers. This rediscretization should take place both for the abscissa and ordinate values of the distributions. As stochastic solvers often display noisy data as model output, attention is paid to the smoothening of the output distributions as well. It is highlighted that the kernel‐smoothening method is very promising, as it can reliably tackle postprocessing of nonsymmetric distributions. Guidelines are formulated regarding the correct interpretation of the distribution tail both for the input and output modifications.",

To solve this problem, a high‐precision remote sensing detection method based on the advanced YOLOv4 framework is proposed. First, a clustering algorithm that combines knowledge of object scales to generate a priori anchor boxes with a higher matching degree is proposed. The feature extension module is designed to expand the receptive field of the backbone network and capture important contextual information. After that, coordinate attention (CA) is introduced to suppress the extra noise under multi‐scale fusion that is rarely noticed in previous work. In addition, a convolutional idea of self‐learning structure has also been novelly proposed and combined with a high‐resolution network to efficiently enhance the performance of the network under limited computing resources. Finally, detailed experiments are performed on the HRRSD dataset. The experimental results show that the network has a more satisfactory superiority, and it is conducive to the advancement of optical remote sensing technology.",

Thus, investigations of the fundamental properties of the double perovskite halide to search for an ideal structure are crucial. In this study, a surrogate model is developed to predict the formation energy, convex hull energy, and bandgap of A 2 BB′X 6 type double perovskite halide structures. The material properties of 13 542 candidate structures are predicted and validated through first‐principles calculations. Without double perovskite halide information during training, the prediction accuracy for the formation energy is obtained as an R‐squared value of 0.770 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.404 eV atom −1 . For the convex hull energy, an accuracy of 0.642 is obtained. For the bandgap, R‐squared score of 0.427 and an RMSE of 1.235 eV are achieved. Furthermore, the optimization process confirms that adding only 850 (6%) double perovskite halide structures to the training set increases the R‐squared value to 0.90 for the formation energy. In the bandgap, more data are needed; 3550 data (68.2%) are added to achieve an R‐squared score of 0.9.

High‐level ab initio calculations of their Δ E ST provide benchmark results, but they are very time consuming and little practical for large‐size systems. Here, the performances of hole–hole Tamm–Dancoff approximated density functional theory (hh‐TDA‐DFT) and the functional dependent accuracy of hh‐TDA are examined on Δ E ST of a large number of MR‐ and D‐A TADF molecules. The results indicate that hh‐TDA combined with the hybrid functional B3LYP can predict Δ E ST values for a wide number of MR‐TADF molecules with mean absolute error (MAE) within 0.04 eV with correlation as high as 0.75. For D‐A TADF molecules, Δ E ST is less sensitive to the nature of the functionals, with MAE as low as 0.07 eV. The larger discrepancy between Δ E ST obtained from hh‐TDA‐DFT and experimental data in several oxygen‐containing MR‐TADF molecules is assumed to stem from the aggregation tendency of these compounds in solution. These findings provide important insights on the role of aggregation in reducing the Δ E ST of MR‐TADF compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 2D materials and their heterostructures are prominent for fabricating next‐generation optical and photonic devices. The optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of 2D materials largely depend on atomic layer numbers. Although machine learning techniques are implemented to identify large‐area thickness distribution using microscopic images, the existing work mainly focuses on rough identification of thicknesses with in‐house datasets which limits fair and comprehensive comparisons of new machine learning approaches. Here, first a microscopic dataset is collected and released for three fundamental image processing tasks including multilabel classification, segmentation, and detection. Then three deep‐learning architectures DenseNet , U‐Net , and Mask‐region convolutional neural network (RCNN) are benchmarked on three tasks and their robustness is evaluated on the augmented 2D microscopic images with different optical contrast variations. Deep learning models are trained and evaluated to identify mono‐, bi‐, tri‐, multilayer and bulk flakes using microscopic images of MoS 2 fabricated on the SiO 2 /Si substrate by chemical vapor deposition. The relation between model performances and statistics of datasets is studied based on the international commission on illumination (CIE) 1931 color space and red, green, blue (RGB) histograms of optical contrast differences. Finally, the robust pretrained models are integrated into a graphic user interface for the on‐site use of full field‐of‐view images captured by bright‐field microscopes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The thermodiffusion behavior of binary Lennard‐Jones mixtures in the liquid state is investigated by combining the individual strengths of non‐equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) and equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations. On the one hand, boundary‐driven NEMD simulations are useful to quickly predict Soret coefficients because they are easy to set up and straightforward to analyze. However, careful interpolation is required because the mean temperature in the measurement region does not exactly reach the target temperature. On the other hand, EMD simulations attain the target temperature precisely and yield a multitude of properties that clarify the microscopic origins of Soret coefficient trends. An analysis of the Soret coefficient suggests a straightforward dependence on the thermodynamic properties, whereas its dependence on dynamic properties is far more complex. Furthermore, a limit of applicability of a popular theoretical model, which mainly relies on thermodynamic data, was identified by virtue of an uncertainty analysis in conjunction with efficient empirical Soret coefficient predictions, which rely on model parameters instead of simulation output. Finally, the present study underscores that a combination of predictive models and EMD and NEMD simulations is a powerful approach to shed light onto the thermodiffusion behavior of liquid mixtures.",

Different geometrical configurations are assessed with the adsorption energy, charge transfer, and density of states. The system with vacancy defects shows a large adsorption energy (19.96 eV) for the Co 5 cluster. This behavior may be associated to the overlapping of the electronic state contributions between cobalt and carbon atoms in the valence states. This indicates that the Co 5 cluster could be deposited on N‐doped γ‐GY monolayers (Co n @GYNs‐def). The lowest‐energy systems are evaluated to estimate the strength of the interaction with hydrogen molecules ( x H 2 , where x = 1–5). According to the adsorption energy values, the modified γ‐GY monolayers are allowed to be a suitable support material to capture H 2 molecules via the small Co n clusters. The hydrogen retention capacity for the supported cobalt atoms corresponding to the lowest‐energy configurations and larger systems are evaluated by using molecular dynamics simulations with the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The role played by defects in the GYNs‐def monolayers is important, since the Co n clusters remain attached to the vacancy with the absence of surface diffusion. This study may represent a guide to tailor novel nanostructures based on small cobalt clusters supported on graphyne monolayers modified to be applied in H 2 adsorption.",

Among different clean energy producers, wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are the most attractive ones due to their abundant availability, substantial power production capability, and cost effective attributes. But, their intermittent availability makes the system operation extremely vulnerable. Therefore, optimum utilization of renewable energy in hybrid power system (HPS) may not be achievable without the integration of energy storage facilities. In this context, integration of battery energy storage (BES) systems with Wind+PV+Thermal (WPT) hybrid configuration is considered in this work to meet the sudden and short term disharmony between actual and available renewable power output. Moreover, to maintain a secure system voltage of the WPT+BES system, the impact of reactive power ( Q ) capability of doubly fed induction generator has also been analyzed. The scheduling problem of the proposed HPS is solved by formulating in an optimization framework. Intelligent technique is applied to evaluate the optimal operational paradigm at multiple percentage of renewable energy penetration scenarios at which the proposed HPS may operate in a voltage secure and cost effective manner. The validation of the proposed operating strategy on the comparative performance evaluation of WPT and WPT+BES systems is portrayed on IEEE30 bus benchmark power system configuration.",

An indirect bandgap of 1.99 eV and type‐II band alignment are formed in the C 2 N/GaN heterostructure, which can facilitate the spatially efficient separation of photogenerated carrier pairs, and the band edge position matches the reduction potential of water. The catalytic performance of the HER reaction at the C and N sites is compared and that the N site is better in performance is found, but still requires a potential barrier of 0.60 eV. In order to improve the catalytic performance of the C 2 N/GaN heterostructure, an N atom is replaced by a P atom to obtain P‐C 2 N/GaN. The band alignment of the P‐C 2 N/GaN heterostructure is still type‐II, and the band edges satisfy the reduction potential of water. Fortunately, the P or N sites play a crucial role in the HER process with a relatively low overpotential of 0.38 eV, which suggests that P‐C 2 N/GaN can improve the catalytic performance of the heterojunction. Overall, the P‐C 2 N/GaN heterostructure has suitable band gap values and band edges, and efficient charge separation in the heterostructure makes it a promising HER catalyst.",

Three different donors, viz., carbazole, phenoxazine, and 5,10‐dihydrophenazine are substituted on the rim position of corannulene to alter the absorption properties. The relationship between chemical structure and TADF property is established by evaluating the dihedral angle between donor and acceptor units, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) values, the energy difference between singlet‐triplet excited states (Δ E ST ), and rates of reverse intersystem crossing ( k RISC ). The newly designed TADF emitters show absorption in the blue to near‐IR regions depending on the strength of the donor and acceptor moieties. Careful analysis of these properties delineates the relationship between SOC values and the nature of the excited states, which is crucial for achieving high k RISC .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Titanium disulfide is a quasi‐2D transition‐metal dichalcogenide relevant for various potential applications. To exploit its technological capabilities, it is important to determine its fundamental properties including the lattice dynamics. The TiS 2 phonon dispersion curves available to date do not reproduce properly the experimental data for several reasons: i) all available experimental data are not taken into consideration, thus poor theory‐experiment agreements have been obtained; ii) the (unknown) frequency of the infrared mode A 2u is erroneously assumed; and iii) such incorrect assignment has propagated in the literature, particularly in phonon dispersion calculations. It is presented here a thorough density functional theory analysis to determine the phonon dispersion curves of TiS 2 , accounting for the frequencies of all experimental phonon data available to date. These include the frequencies of nine zone‐edge Raman active modes of Ag‐intercalated TiS 2 , in addition to infrared, Raman, and neutron scattering data. An incorrect frequency assignment of the A 2u mode in the literature is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, results of attenuated total reflection terahertz spectroscopy applied to TiS 2 are provided. A self‐intercalation paradigm is presented to give a rationale for the temperature dependence of the poorly understood Raman features observed in pristine TiS 2 at frequencies above the A 1g mode.",

However, JAK3 has high homology with other members of the JAK family, making the development of JAK3 inhibitors full of challenges. Thus, here, a naïve Bayesian classification (NBC) model based on multiple JAK3 protein conformations, which integrates molecular docking, pharmacophore, and molecular descriptors, is developed to find novel JAK3 inhibitors. First, the validation set is used to prove whether molecular docking or pharmacophore, integrating multiple JAK3 conformations always has higher prediction accuracy than that of any single conformation. Second, external prediction reveals that the NBC model combining molecular docking, pharmacophore, and important molecular features could significantly improve the enrichment of active JAK3 inhibitors. Finally, the optimal NBC model is utilized for virtual screening against a large chemical database and some compounds with high Bayesian scores are identified. Altogether, the machine learning‐based virtual screening protocol not only has strong efficiency but also has high screening accuracy. It is hoped that the developed virtual screening strategy could provide valuable guidance for the discovery of novel JAK3 inhibitors.",

In response to the problems of defect‐induced nonradiative compounding and voltage loss caused by the common perovskite layer, the common strategies of interfacial engineering, altering crystal equivalence, and other modifications involve more complex processes and higher fabrication costs. In order to simplify the process and save costs, this work has omitted the electron transport layer (ETL), while still maintaining a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). This work has simulated PSCs with CsPbI 3 (electron transport layer free) and have matched Cu 2 O as the most suitable hole transport layer (HTL) material. By simulating and optimizing the thickness and defect density of perovskite absorption layer and the defect density of interface defect layer (IDL1, IDL2), and determining the most suitable operating temperature, the PCE of the device can reach 18.8%, which is consistent with the experimental data. The asymmetric effect of the interface defect layer obtained in this work is similar to previous research reports.

For the case of organic crystals, data‐guided design platforms involve two problems: the need to construct regression models that can predict solid‐state properties from molecular structures alone and the vast number of molecular structures that satisfy a targeted solid‐state property. In this paper, a new pipeline is presented for designing molecules with targeted solid‐state electronic properties. Here, the first problem is overcome by means of a novel visualization method for band structure data, which allows the user to specify their design preferences and simplify the creation of the required regression models. The second problem is overcome by allowing for user intervention in the selection of the final molecule for subsequent synthesis. The effectiveness of this pipeline is demonstrated by using it to design a simple new molecule with a targeted bandgap and impressive band dispersion. This pipeline is the first data‐guided method that can design new molecules on the basis of genuine solid‐state electronic properties, and with its emphasis on user‐inclusivity, it can easily be applied in collaborative or industry settings.",

This work investigates several heterostructure systems of typical semiconductors with zinc‐blende unit cells forming an interface in the contact plane. The purpose is to understand the trends in the electronic properties of such heterostructures regarding the strain profile, as it occurs near the interface and far away in deeper atomic planes. The local band‐gap values of each layer of atoms are calculated to demonstrate how the gaps have changed with respect to the distance from the interface. Finally, the potential energy at the interface region is parameterized. The correlation between the transmission coefficient of the one‐electron wave function is analyzed to pass through the interface and interface characteristic parameters. The primary conclusion is that the system's electrostatic potential embeds the heterostructure's unique properties. It is demonstrated how one can predict the transmission coefficient of the electronic wave function at the interface by examining the material's potential parameters at the interface exclusively.",

The comparison with the experimental values of Δ f and ΔΓ allows to estimate the stiffness of the contacts between the spheres and the resonator surface. The contact stiffness is of interest in contact mechanics, but also in sensing because it depends on the properties of thin films situated between the resonator surface and the sphere. The simulation differs from previous implementations of FreqD‐LBM insofar, as the material inside the particles is not included in the FreqD‐LBM algorithm. Rather, the particle surface is configured to be an oscillating boundary. The amplitude of the particles' motions (displacement and rotation) is governed by the force balance at the surface of the particle. Because the contact stiffness enters this balance, it can be derived from experimental values of Δ f and ΔΓ. The simulation reproduces experiments by the Krakow group. For sufficiently small spheres, a contact stiffness can be derived from the comparison of the simulation with the experiment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polycrystalline materials have shown promise in advanced optical applications because of their unique optical and mechanical properties. Most polycrystalline materials have non‐uniform optical properties due to residual porosity, secondary phases, and/or crystalline anisotropies (e.g., birefringence). These optical inhomogeneities manifest as scattering that reduces the transparency of the polycrystal. Even in the case of a single‐phase polycrystal with negligible porosity, birefringence scattering will always be present whenever the crystal is anisotropic (non‐cubic). Multiple models for predicting birefringence scattering have been suggested in the literature that are successful in describing scattering loss in specific material systems. Here a first‐principles model of birefringent scattering that is applicable to any single‐phase, unaligned transparent polycrystal is derived. The model can treat grain size distributions and is not limited to a specific material system. The derivation culminates in an equation that describes birefringence scattering coefficient spectra using the single‐crystal refractive index tensor and chord length distribution (measured from a representative polished surface micrograph). The model should be useful for designing materials and characterization. For example, it can be used to predict transmissions of transparent polycrystals for a range of grain sizes or to characterize the average grain size using a transmission measurement.",

First, the PyroSim software is used to simulate the fire scene on the sixth deck of the passenger ship. Through which the real‐time temperature, carbon monoxide (CO) concentration, and visibility of each exit are obtained, and the spread speed of the fire hazard area is determined. Then, the artificial fish swarm algorithm is improved by using the dynamic Visual and step , and the optimal path planning for the evacuation of passenger ships is achieved. The Visualized Evacuation Guidance System (VEGS) is developed to provide the optimal route for evacuees on the passenger ship. Finally, VEGS is applied to the fire evacuation of passenger ships. The results show that VEGS can provide the optimal evacuation path for evacuees and avoid detours in fire hazard areas compared with other algorithms. Seventy‐five percent of the evacuees who used VEGS in the event of a passenger ship can escape in a time shortened by up to 40.8%.",

One promising avenue is the development of heterostructured scintillators where multiple materials work in synergy to exceed the performance of each individual component. Applied to ToF‐PET detectors, one component contributes predominantly to the absorption of gamma rays and the other to the creation of ultra‐fast photons. Whilst other authors have proposed various concepts, heterostructured scintillators are still in their infancy and scientifically guiding their development remains a challenge. Toward this aim and based on simulation and modeling developments, heterostructure properties are directly linked to ToF‐PET performance. This is made possible by redefining the notions of detector photo‐peak efficiency and timing response, as defined for monolithic detectors, in the context of heterostructured scintillators. Their overall potential is then discussed as a function of the materials and design used. This provides a quantitative framework to rapidly and efficiently support the advancement of heterostructured detectors for ToF‐PET technology.",

Second, novel anchors are designed using modified k‐means clustering to accelerate the model convergence and yield superior detection precision.

    "abstract": "Abstract Transparent thermal heaters based on metallic networks have gained considerable attention in the last few years as a result of their superior response time, low sheet resistance, and low cost of manufacturing. To increase the mechanical stability and reliability of the thermal heater, it is desirable to embed the metallic network in some form of matrix. Embedding the network, however, changes the nature of thermal conduction making both in‐plane and out‐of‐plane thermal conduction important for ensuring reliability and uniform thermal distribution. The performance of embedded thermal heaters is also significantly influenced by the geometry of the metallic network, both in terms of optical transparency and thermal performance. In this paper, a coupled electro‐thermal model and an electromagnetic model are developed to investigate the properties of an embedded metallic mesh in a polymer matrix. Infrared thermal imaging and ultraviolet‐visible spectrophotometry are used to quantify thermal transport and transparency in the system and to verify the performance of finite element models. A systematic study is then performed to assess the role of network topology both on in‐plane and out‐of‐plane thermal distribution and optical performance. According to numerical analysis, a structure‐property relationship is established which can provide desirable network configurations to optimize performance.",

However, these methods often involve significant computational expenses, thereby limiting the number of feasible studies and hindering the extraction of valuable structure−property guidelines for a rational design of novel HTMs. To address these challenges, this study proposes an ultrafast predictive model that balances prediction accuracy and time efficiency, a critical aspect for predicting the hole mobility of HTMs for perovskite optimization. The model, which leverages the Random Forest learning algorithm, enables comprehensive and rapid analysis of photovoltaic features taken from previous experiments/literature and processed with the RDKit Python library. Notably, recognizing the challenges associated with high correlation in the dataset, a method to improve the calculation of feature importance in random forests is applied. The results highlight bertz_ct, chi1, and logP as key predictive features of HTM performance. However, the model underscores the need to uncover additional predictive features based on structure–property relationships to predict the optimized hole mobility. This approach significantly accelerates the discovery process, outperforming prevalent statistical methods in the prediction of hole mobility and HTM performance. This research signifies a pivotal step toward cost‐effective, accelerated stability and efficiency of HTMs, with implications for the advancement of optoelectronic devices.",

In the case of Fe@Mo 2 CO 2 , a mechanism resembling that of Termolecular Langmuir–Hinshelwood (TLH) is thermodynamically and kinetically favored, displaying very exothermic CO 2 formation, low activation energies, and easy CO 2 desorption. On Ti@Mo 2 CO 2 , the dissociation of CO 2 is almost barrierless and much more likely to occur than CO 2 desorption, barring the usage of this surface as a catalyst for CO oxidation. Finally, on Zn@Mo 2 CO 2 , a hybrid Langmuir–Hinshelwood/Eley–Rideal (LH/ER) mechanism is thermodynamically and kinetically feasible. Here, after the first CO 2 forms, with an energy barrier of only 0.62 eV, the second CO 2 is formed spontaneously, and the Zn–CO 2 interactions are weak enough to allow desorption. The calculated thermodynamic quantities and reaction rates at T = 300 K indicate that Fe@Mo 2 CO 2 should be quite active toward CO oxidation, followed by Zn@Mo 2 CO 2 , while the Ti‐based model is inactive.

    "abstract": "Abstract Since adopting 5G technology, a notable rise in the prevalence of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the environment has become a significant concern. To reduce EM interference, broadband metamaterial absorbers offer an alternative solution for protecting devices in defense, communication, and healthcare applications, unlike their narrowband counterparts. This article presents a numerical investigation of an ultra‐thin, polarization‐insensitive metamaterial absorber (MMA) that uses metasurfaces and provides electromagnetic interference (EMI) reduction, covering the FR2/mmWave licensed N258 and N261 bands with an oblique incidence angle of up to 15 degrees. Comprehensive simulations are performed within the CST Studio Suite S2 2023 to examine the absorber's performance. Under normal incidence, the proposed MMA exhibits a wideband absorbency response exceeding 90% within the frequency range of 24.30–28.12 GHz. Moreover, the physical absorption mechanism is explained with electric and magnetic field distributions, including surface current distributions. Confirmation of the lack of mutual interaction among neighboring unit cells is established through testing with 1 × 2 and 2 × 2 arrays. An equivalent circuit model is also developed to confirm the EM simulation findings. The notable features of the proposed MMA make it an exceptional candidate for EM shielding applications, providing EMI reduction and covering the N258 and N261 bands.",

This innovative technique addresses the challenges associated with trial‐and‐error‐based material design and experimental iterations. In this study, finite element‐based topology optimization is employed to achieve optimized material structural patterns that maximize the lateral expansion of previously established auxetic designs and replicate specific directional properties observed in human skin. The topology‐optimized models, including slit, I‐shape, anisotropic I‐shape, triangular pattern, and re‐entrant shapes, demonstrate material structures with lower maximum stress, reducing the likelihood of material rupture failure and enhancing lateral expansion by more than 50% compared to the initial patterns. These novel designs and their unique behaviors are verified using the theoretical model of hyperelastic auxetic materials. This study represents the first analysis of topology optimization applied to soft hyperelastic biomaterials, focusing on both maximizing auxetic properties and replicating auxetic properties of human skin. The auxetic designs and topology optimization technique developed in this research hold potential for integration into biomedical and personal protective applications.",

Additionally, the effect of alkali metal atoms decorating AuTe‐X (X = Li, Na, K) and related structural, electronic, optical, and topological insulator properties, along with the biaxial strain on the lithium‐decorated AuTe‐Li monolayer are investigated. The AuTe monolayer shows metallic characteristics, and when alkali metal atoms are decorated onto it, the resulting structures remain dynamically stable. Notably, the introduction of Li, Na, and K atoms induces bandgap opening in the decorated Li and Na monolayers near the Fermi level, causing metal‐to‐narrow bandgap semiconductor and Dirac semi‐metal transitions. Conversely, the metallic nature of the decorated AuTe‐K monolayer is retained. The emergence of a bandgap near the Fermi level, caused by alkali metal decoration, triggers a topological phase transition in AuTe‐Li, AuTe‐Na, and AuTe‐K monolayers. Optical analyses reveal that AuTe‐K decorated structure enhances light absorption in the visible spectrum. Consequently, the findings provide insights into the decoration of these two‐dimensional material monolayers, potentially advancing research and motivating the production of such monolayers for current nanodevice applications.",

It integrates acceptor moieties via thiophene to fluorene core, resulting in five novel HTMs (SFD‐1 to SFD‐5). The results exhibit that derivative HTMs show excellent coherence in excitation, dispersion, and transportation of charge carriers, ensuring robust hole mobility. The anchor moieties functionalized HTMs unveil excellent band alignment with perovskite with fitting HOMO energy levels (−4.93–−5.35 eV), less optical absorption in visible portion ( &lt; 520). This acceptor integration has improved the hole mobility in derivatives, accredited to the smaller hole reorganization energy (0.14–0.68 eV), and greater hole transfer integral (0.22–0.33 eV). The transition density matrix analysis exhibited robust electronic coupling, subtler charge carrier overlapping and greater charge transfer length (7.48–13.73 Å). This resulted in an excellent upsurge in intrinsic charge transference (70.75–92.70%) and smaller exciton binding energy, leading to easier exciton dissociation, and fewer recombination fatalities. However, an adequate variation in dipole moment (4.04 D to 16.34 D) and Gibbs solvation‐free energy (−18.06 to −21.89 kcal mol −1 ) ensures facile film formation and processability. In conclusion, this approach recommends these flourene‐based HTMs are highly desireable for forthcoming solar cell technology.",

Thus, in this scientific investigation, it delves into the intricate dynamics of Jeffery‐Hamel flow for second‐grade fluids under the influence of velocity slip, magnetic, and electric fields. A transformative journey is set out using the electro‐hydromagnetic second‐grade fluid theory as the basis. The regulating partial differential equations responsible for this fluid flow phenomenon experience a significant transformation, evolving into ordinary differential equations. Then, two distinct but powerful analytical methods are used to analyze these ordinary differential equations: the widely used Adomian decomposition method and the 4th–5th order Runge‐Kutta Fehlberg method, which is enhanced by the shooting operation. Various factors influencing the skin friction coefficient and the dimensionless velocity (represented as “f”) of the second‐grade fluid are examined. The electric and magnetic fields, the Deborah number, and the elusive velocity slip components are among the many physical variables that are observed. The behavior of the fluid inside the channel is affected by these parameters in the same way that cosmic bodies are affected by gravity. As it delves deeper into the topic of fluid dynamics, and makes some interesting discoveries. The lowest parts of the channel exhibit significantly less backflow; indicating a distinct lack of it. Similar to start alignment, this absence is observed when the Hartmann number rises, decreasing the reverse flow until it vanishes completely.

At high frequencies of 15–64.7 GHz, 10 dB RCS reduction is achieved by a phase cancellation mechanism, which is realized by arranging a perfect electric conductor (PEC) to form an arrayed structure with varying heights. At low frequencies of 6–15 GHz, 10 dB RCS reduction is achieved by the absorption mechanism, which is realized by designing a rotationally symmetric dual‐pattern absorber. The coupled mode theory (CMT) is used to explain the absorption mechanism. Additionally, it is found that a 180° phase difference is obtained by two different patterns to enhance RCS reduction in the high‐frequency band of 28–35 GHz. Finally, the phase cancellation and absorption mechanisms are combined to achieve an ultra‐wideband 10 dB RCS reduction from 6 to 64.7 GHz, which is realized by integrating the absorber into the arrayed structure to form the ultra‐wideband RCS reduction metasurface.

Therefore, in this work, the adsorption of water molecules, stability, optical, and electronic properties of double perovskites Cs 2 AgInX 6 (X = Br, Cl) are investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Theoretical analysis shows that these double perovskites are thermodynamically stable. The diffusion coefficient of water in layers of Cs 2 AgInBr 6 and Cs 2 AgInCl 6 is much lower than that of MAPbI 3 according to means square displacement analysis, and also based on values of adsorption energy, the hydrophilicity of the proposed structure is lower than that of PbI 2 ‐terminated and MAI‐terminated surfaces. These materials demonstrate better ductility and mechanical stability than their corresponding 3D perovskites. For Cs 2 AgInBr 6 and Cs 2 AgInCl 6 , direct bandgap values are 1.49 and 3.14 eV, respectively, using hybrid Perdew‐Berke‐Ernzerhof + spin‐orbit‐coupling(PBE0+SOC) functional. Calculations of key solar cell parameters predict that Cs 2 AgInBr 6 may achieve efficiencies competitive with MAPbI 3 due to its high short‐circuit current, making it a promising stable, non‐toxic perovskite absorber material.

The TBS can store excessive heat flux quickly in the shell and release it slowly when it is needed, which also has some distinctive features: first it is a buffer shell that can avoid external extremes in temperature (either high or low) and also provide a relatively stable temperature for the interior of the shell when the temperature outside the shell has some fluctuations; second the TBS is not thermally insulated (with holes connected to the outside world) and the buffering effect of the TBS originates from the heat recycling mechanics, not thermal insulation; third the TBS has a short response time and the temperature inside the shell can be quickly adjusted according to the average temperature outside the shell; fourth the TBS is a passive device. Unlike traditional air conditioning, the TBS can work without an external power supply. The TBS will have many applications in energy recycling systems, smart heat controlling systems, and passive heat self‐adaptation systems. Numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations are given to verify the function of the TBS.",

Specific guidelines on how to choose proper values for the simulation model parameters are given here. It is shown that i) the reaction interval should be chosen from the ballistic region of the diffusion profile; and ii) the first valley of the radial distribution function of reactants is a good value for the reaction capture radius for polycondensation in terms of accuracy of the calculations. Moreover, a recipe to determine the rate constant from the kinetic equation is explicitly proposed.

The different character of the constituents leads to very diverse self‐energy corrections of individual Kohn–Sham states, and thus the band structure is distinctively different from its DFT counterpart, that is, many‐body effects cannot be regarded as a rigid shift of the conduction bands. The nature of the optical excitations at the interface over a wide energy range is explored and it is shown that various kinds of electron‐hole pairs are formed, comprising hybrid excitons and (hybrid) charge‐transfer excitations. The absorption onset is characterized by a strongly bound bright ZnO‐dominated hybrid exciton. For the selected examples of either exciton type, the individual contributions from the valence and conduction bands are analyzed and the binding strength and extension of the electron‐hole wavefunctions are discussed.",

In this paper, based on the global particle‐swarm optimization algorithm and the density functional theory methods, two new novel stable SiC 7 (α‐SiC 7 and β‐SiC 7 ) was predicted, which are 22 meV per atom and 86 meV per atom lower than g‐SiC 7 in energy, respectively. Among them, β‐SiC 7 presents graphene‐like honeycomb configuration, having a direct band gap of 1.01 eV, which covers the main energy of the solar spectrum. Moreover, its hole mobility can reach ≈10 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is much higher than that of silicon. These advantages make it a promising candidate as a donor material for excitonic solar cells.

The method relies on a multi‐configurational supercell approach that takes into account the configurational and vibrational contributions to the free energy.

Overall excellent agreement with the available experimental data is demonstrated, namely: 1) zinc‐blende is energetically most favorable, 2) the solid solution energy band gap lies within the 2–3 eV range, and 3) the energy band gap of the solid solution is direct for compositions %. It is found that at ambient conditions, (GaP) x (ZnS) solid solutions with , 50% and 75% render promising hydrogen evolution photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light, owing to their favorable energy band gaps and band levels relative to vacuum.",

The aKMC results show that lighter alkali atoms can diffuse into the CuInSe 2 grains, whereas the diffusion of heavier alkali atoms is limited to the Cu‐poor region of the absorber. The key difference between the diffusion of lighter and heavier alkali elements is the energy barrier of the ion exchange between alkali interstitial atoms and Cu. For lighter alkali atoms like Na, the interstitial diffusion and the ion‐exchange mechanism have comparable energy barriers. Therefore, Na interstitial atoms can diffuse into the grains and replace Cu atoms in the CuInSe 2 lattice. In contrast to Na, the ion‐exchange mechanism occurs spontaneously for heavier alkali atoms like Rb and the further diffusion of these atoms depends on the availability of Cu vacancies. The outdiffusion of alkali substitutional atoms from the grains results in the formation of Cu vacancies which in turn increases the hole concentration in the absorber. In this respect, Na is more efficient than Rb due to the higher concentration of Na substitutional defects in the CuInSe 2 grains.",

Using OSEP, the origins of ferroelectricity in two classic ferroelectric perovskites, BaTiO 3 and PbTiO 3 , are systematically revisited. The fact that the hybridization between the Ti 3d state and the O 2p state is essential for the formation of ferroelectricity in both BaTiO 3 and PbTiO 3 is reproduced, which validates this method. Particularly, for PbTiO 3 , the Pb 6s lone‐pair electron states can also be tuned using the OSEP method, and its influence on the ferroelectricity is unveiled in detail. Surprisingly, it is found that the electric dipoles formed by lone‐pair lobes contribute only slightly to the overall ferroelectric polarization, whereas the concomitant ionic displacements and lattice distortions are prominently favorable for ferroelectricity. Indeed, it is found that the Pb–O hybridization plays an important role in the ferroelectricity of PbTiO 3 , which makes the polarization of PbTiO 3 significantly larger than that of BaTiO 3 . This study provides a simple yet straightforward way to demonstrate the mechanisms of ferroelectricity in perovskite oxides, which can be applied to the study of ferroelectric mechanism in other relevant materials.",

Phase transition phenomena at liquid–vapor interfaces are greatly governed by intermolecular‐level kinetics, which requires the use of empirical parameters in continuum‐level relations to explain the discrete nature of molecular particles. Despite its significance, it has been a great challenge to find detailed expressions of empirical parameters such as accommodation coefficients, which represent the probabilities for phase transition of liquid or vapor molecules at the interface. Here, direct statistical measurements of accommodation coefficients are reported by tracking the trajectories of liquid and vapor molecules in molecular simulations. The measurements reveal that evaporation and condensation coefficients are different by ≈50%, whereas they have been assumed to be equal in most previous studies. Then, the indirect measurement method is studied from a perspective of theoretical genetics based on the diffusion approximation. A good agreement between two approaches suggests that diffusion approximation can contribute to provide empirical parameters with a cost‐effective method.",

The presented scheme exhibits an exceptionally high accuracy. It is clearly different from other techniques that have been conventionally used to calculate the magnitude of the effective exchange interaction ( J ) and the band structure of organic radicals. This enhanced performance is explained by these facts: i) the proposed scheme allows one to estimate band structures with electronic correlation between whole molecules in the crystal, ii) no crystal cutting‐induced artifacts and errors are introduced, and iii) both spin polarization and spin contamination are treated correctly. Consequently, the discrepancy between the experimental J value and the estimated value by the scheme equals 11.1 cm −1 . The scheme can be applied to the DFT‐D method, which is mostly considered for dispersion force. The collaboration allows discussions on the relationship between the magnetic and electronic properties, and the geometric structures. Moreover, it gives useful insights for the design of new functional organic materials.

High‐throughput workflow performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) model (VCA‐DFT) is designed. The workflow is tested by predicting properties including in‐plane lattice constants, band gaps, effective masses, spin–orbit coupling, and band alignments of the Mo‐W‐S‐Se, Mo‐W‐S‐Te, and Mo‐W‐Se‐Te 2D CCTMCAs. The VCA‐DFT results are validated by computing the same properties using unit cells and supercells of selected compositions. The VCA‐DFT results of the abovementioned five properties are comparable to that of DFT calculations, with some inaccuracies in several properties of MoSTe and WSTe. Moreover, 2D CCTMCAs can form type II heterostructures as used in photovoltaics.

This allows for large‐scale simulations of PTO films on STO substrates with system sizes &gt;2000 atoms. In the ultrathin limit, the polar wave texture with cylindrical chiral bubbles emerges as an intermediate phase between full‐flux‐closure domains and in‐plane polarization. This is driven by an internal bias field born of the compositionally broken inversion symmetry in the [001] direction. Manipulation of this built‐in field informs a new principle of design for control over chiral order on the nanoscale through the careful choice of substrate, surface termination, or use of overlayers. Antiferrodistortive (AFD) order locally interacts with these polar textures giving rise to strong FE/AFD coupling at the PbO terminated surface driving a surface reconstruction.

With the classification contribution degree, OS‐CCD enables positive samples near the class boundary and located in an area with high density of positive samples to generate more synthetic samples than others. Furthermore, the neighbor selection for oversampling is no longer random but in the light of a selected probability.

The microstatic stiffness prediction models are proposed based on the radial and axial deformation mechanisms of helix wire units. The constitutive static stiffness model for predicting the macromechanical properties of MR samples is developed with consideration of the separation state, the sliding contact state, and the extrusion contact state between the metal wires based on the force interaction and the Coulomb friction. Moreover, an orthogonal experiment is designed, and subsequently the static stiffness tests of MR samples are carried out. Based on static stiffness tests, a semiempirical stiffness model with consideration of the material and process parameters, including the relative density of MR samples, the wire diameter, and the Young's modulus of metal wires is developed. Results show a good agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimental static stiffness of MR specimens with a correlation index R 2 of 0.9692.",

This criterion has significantly stimulated study on porous metallic carbon with intrinsically high electron conductivity. In contrast to the previously reported metallic T6‐carbon constructed by interlocking carbon hexagons, here a new 3D metallic carbon composed of interlocking carbon pentagons, penta‐h22, is proposed. Based on state‐of‐the‐art theoretical calculations, it is shown that penta‐h22 is energetically more stable than T6‐carbon. More importantly, different from T6‐carbon with too small pores for metal ions, penta‐h22 possesses a large specific capacity of 609 mAh g –1 , low diffusion barrier of 0.20 eV, low open‐circuit voltage of 0.63 V, and small volume change of 1.75%. These parameters clearly indicate that pentagon‐based 3D porous carbon is promising for the anode of Na‐ion batteries.",

To quantify the inherent system‐uncertainty efficiently, Monte Carlo simulation is proposed in conjunction with the machine learning based FE computational framework for obtaining complete probabilistic descriptions considering both individual and compound effect of stochasticity. A variance based sensitivity analysis is carried out to enumerate the relative significance of different material parameters corresponding to various constituting parts of the coronavirus structure.

An interesting candidate for the top cell absorber is represented by copper zinc tin sulfide Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS). In this work, the CZTS/Si tandem solar cell is optimized by using indium oxide / Cadmium sulfide (In 2 O 3 /CdS) hybrid buffer.

The added In 2 O 3 layer has a thickness of 0.022 µm and is n‐doped with a concentration of 1e20 cm −3 . Compared with a CZTS/Si in which the hybrid buffer is of CdS, the efficiency is increased from 13.5% to 28.4%. These hybrid In 2 O 3 /CdS buffers provide a promising way to reduce the V OC deficit and further boost the efficiency of CZTS/Si solar cells.",

In general, monolayered and few‐layered nanosheets are obtained by exfoliation of the precursor layered materials. However, lateral‐size distribution of the nanosheets is not easily controlled through the exfoliation because of the unpredictable down‐sizing processes. The present work shows selective syntheses of transition‐metal‐oxide nanosheets with the monodisperse and polydisperse lateral sizes by the assistance of machine learning on small experimental data. The precursor layered composites of host transition‐metal oxides and interlayer organic guests are exfoliated into the surface‐modified nanosheets in organic dispersion media. A prediction model of the size distribution is constructed by sparse modeling, a method of machine learning, on the experimental data. The host‐guest‐medium combinations achieving the monodisperse and polydisperse lateral sizes are recommended by the prediction model. Therefore, the nanosheets with the controlled lateral‐size distribution are selectively obtained in a limited number of the experiments. Moreover, self‐assembly of the polydispersed nanosheets forms the homogeneous thin film exhibiting interference color. The prediction model and its construction method can be applied to the other 2D materials. Moreover, the present work implies that sparse modeling is an effective approach for small‐data‐driven materials science.",

However, the main commercial cathode materials are semiconducting transition metal oxides suffering from low electrical conductivity, so cathode materials with good electrical conductivity are highly desirable. It is well‐known that topological quantum materials (TQMs) can exhibit robust electrical conductivity, thus providing a promising solution to this problem. The key question becomes which TQMs can have high ionic conductivity. Herein, such topological quantum cathode materials for fast charging Li‐ion battery are identified by using machine learning combined with first‐principle calculation, where the supervised regression models are trained for diffusion energy barrier prediction. Among 7385 TQMs, 20 materials are found to have a diffusion energy barrier less than 1.0 eV. Especially, LiMnAs exhibits a reversible capacity of 195.9 mAh g −1 , higher than that of commercial cathodes while with comparable diffusion energy barrier. Furthermore, LiMnAs shows high interface stability with selected solid lithium metal oxides electrolytes. This study not only opens a new path to developing novel cathode materials, but also expands the applications of TQMs.",

However, the recorded high resolution in situ videos normally have tremendous amount of data, which is challenging for quantitative analysis. In case of in situ electron diffraction (ED), the classical analysis method only tracks changes of the integral profile and ignores important information of position, intensity, and distribution angle due to the lack of a proper data processing tool. In this work, an ensemble machine‐learning‐based framework which enables the fore‐and‐after tracking of all diffraction spots of an in situ ED video is established. As demonstrated in the case of the lithiation of the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, the method precisely quantifies the changes of lattice parameters and then unveils the inhomogeneous structural evolution induced by the insertion of lithium ions. This method is generally applicable to analyze in situ ED data derived from any dynamical processes, enlarging the capability to grasp the key information from massive in situ data.",

With the advancement of data-driven methods for materials design, candidate materials can be quickly screened for the study of a desired physical property. Efficient methods to automatically analyze and identify phases present in a given pattern, are paramount for the success of this new paradigm. To aid this process, the open source python package Xray Estimation and Refinement Using Similarity (XERUS) for semi-automatic/automatic phase identification is presented. XERUS takes advantages of open crystal structure databases, not relying on proprietary databases, to obtain crystal structures on the fly, being then chemical space agnostic. By wrapping around GSASII, it can automatically simulate patterns and calculate similarity measures used for phase identification. Our approach is simple and quick but also applicable to multiphase identification, by coupling the similarity calculations with quick refinements followed by an iterative peak removal process. XERUS is shown in action in four different experimental datasets and also it is benchmarked against a recently proposed deep learning method for a mixture dataset covering the Li-Mn-O-F chemical space.

However, lithium‐ion batteries generate large amounts of heat as the battery packs are charged and discharged. If this accumulated heat is not dissipated timely, then the power supply system will fail, resulting in safety accidents. Therefore, a high‐efficiency and energy‐saving optimization strategy is required for both ensuring operating temperature of the battery and saving energy. Herein, a lumped thermal model is established on the basis of the heat generation characteristics of batteries and Newton's law of cooling, and its exactitude is proven by comparison with a liquid cooling system established using AMESim. In addition, to reduce computation time and enhance the real‐time capability, an iterative dynamic programming (IDP) method is proposed to determine the optimal values iteratively in a multidimensional search space, in view of the high nonlinearity and time‐variability of a battery thermal management system as well as the complexity of dynamic programming (DP). Thus, the results from co‐simulations performed in Matlab and AMESim verify that the proposed strategy has high cooling efficiency and can save considerable energy for cooling system compared with PID and DP.",

The semimetallic nature of phagraphene is robust against external strain and B‐N co‐doping. Being experimentally realized in a nanoribbon form, this is quite fascinating in the present scenario. In this theoretical study, optical and thermoelectric properties of phagraphene and its site‐dependent B‐N co‐doped analogous configurations are critically investigated employing density functional theory. As a consequence of inherent rectangular symmetry and direction‐dependent behavior of the structures, anisotropic optical responses are obtained. The strain‐induced optical responses further confirm these observations. Different positions of the optical peaks for distinct configurations lead to an elegant way of structural identifications. The absorption spectra of the structures reveal that low‐energy optical transitions take place due to orbitals. Besides, static dielectric constant and refractive index are enhanced for the co‐doped structures. Furthermore, the thermoelectric responses of the structures are explored by adapting the semi‐classical Boltzmann transport equation. Importantly, a significantly higher figure of merit has been perceived, which is quite uncommon among graphene allotropes.",

This study thoroughly analyzes the influence of a Cu dopant on CsPbBr 3 materials through a series of theoretical investigations. Two artificial CsPbBr 3 supercells are constructed, and their electronic properties are analyzed. Additionally, the antibonding nature of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valance band maximum (VBM) of CsPbBr 3 is elucidated. The results indicate that a Cu dopant can only alter the local lattice around it, not the entire lattice. Moreover, the CBM and VBM deformation potentials of CsPbBr 3 behave differently. Therefore, the energetic shift of VBM is more sensitive to the shrinkage of lattice due to the smaller energy difference between the constituent orbitals, leading to a bandgap reduction with the lattice contraction. This study reveals that the two critical reasons for the increase of bandgap are the contribution of Cu‐3d orbitals to the VBM and the localized lattice distortion caused by Cu impurity. Therefore, this work clarifies how Cu impurities improve the blue light emitting performance of CsPbBr 3 systems.",

The results show that four functionalized COF‐300s could create a feasible environment for CO 2 adsorption with high accessible surface area, suitable pore size, and high porosity. The CO 2 adsorption capacity in COF‐300s could be significantly improved by functionalization.

Furthermore, it is observed that the Nusselt number intensifies for the temperature ratio and thermal Biot parameters while it declines for the thermophoresis parameter and Eckert number.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study proposes an efficient method for analyzing complex fracture patterns in the cross‐sections of unidirectional (UD) composites, influenced by the volume fraction (VF) and fiber arrangement, and for predicting the corresponding transverse mechanical responses. Traditional finite element (FE) analysis incurs high computational costs when evaluating responses for every configuration. To address this, deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been applied, but these approaches have typically focused on limited VF spaces, leading to large data requirements and reduced prediction accuracy for new configurations. In this research, a novel DL approach is introduced that can be effectively extended to broader VF spaces by integrating low‐cost, physically insightful auxiliary features as multi‐modal inputs. Specifically, the Mori–Tanaka (MT) feature and stress concentration factor (SCF) are selected as auxiliary inputs and incorporated them into the conventional CNN model for comparative analysis. The results showed that the model incorporating the MT feature significantly improved extrapolation performance in unseen VF spaces while maintaining robust predictive performance as the training dataset size increased. In contrast, the SCF feature does not demonstrate similar benefits. These findings illustrate that integrating advanced features like the MT feature into the DL model can offer more effective and versatile solutions for predicting material properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advancements in gas‐sensitive materials based on metal oxides have mainly relied on experimental trial and error, which is time‐consuming and costly. To address this, a novel approach combining first‐principles calculations and machine learning is proposed to predict the gas response properties of materials. Copper oxide (CuO) is used as a representative material for validation. Six characteristic parameters are selected at the electron and atomic structure level, including adsorption energy (Eads), bandgap (Eg), distortion degree, conduction band minimum (CBM), valence band maximum (VBM), and bond length (d), to build an accelerated gas response discovery model. The results indicate that gas response is determined by changes in these parameters upon gas adsorption, though no direct correlation is found. Machine learning algorithms are applied to establish correlation models, achieving an accuracy of 83.75%. Analysis reveals that the distortion degree has the most significant impact on a gas response (28.57%), while the VBM contributes the least (4.76%). CuO exhibits a strong response to gases like C 3 H 8 O, C 4 H 10 O, CO, H 2 , and NO 2 , but minimal response to C 6 H1 5 N and C 8 H 10 , consistent with literature findings. This work offers new insights for sensor development and could enhance the efficiency of material discovery in gas sensing applications.",

Finally, the Finite Element Method is used to verify the conclusions drawn from theoretical model analysis. The results show that when −1≤ a ←1/3 (where a is the ratio of pressure flow to the sum of drag flow and slip flow), slippage on either the screw wall or the cylinder wall can reduce the extrusion flow rate, and the number of flow recirculation planes is one. When −1/3≤ a ≤1, the number of flow recirculation planes increases to two, and screw wall slip is conducive to expanding the extrusion flow rate. Conversely, cylinder wall slip may reduce the extrusion flow rate. Moreover, the simulation results are consistent with those of the theoretical model, further verifying the rationality of the model.",

The CdS, In 2 S 3 , Zn(O,S), and ZnSe compounds are employed as electron transport layers (ETLs) in conjunction with Cu 3 BiS 3 to determine the optimal condition. The n‐ZnSe/p‐Cu 3 BiS 3 structure outperforms CdS, In 2 S 3 , and Zn(O,S) ETLs by providing a short circuit current (J SC ) of 31.38 mA cm −2 , an open circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.80 V, an 81.49% fill factor (FF), and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.45%. Adding different back surface field (BSF) layers, such as AlSb, BaSi 2 , CGS, and PEDOT:PSS, on the other hand, makes J SC , V OC , and FF much higher, which eventually improves PCE. Use of AlSb, CGS, BaSi 2 , and PEDOT:PSS as BSF layers raises the V OC in the range of 0.92 to 0.96 V. The presence of each BSF layer boosts the current by ≈5 mA cm −2 .

The Fairen–Velarde model provides a theoretical framework to study the interplay between oxygen and nutrient concentrations in bacterial populations, representing a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations. In this work, how the introduction of noise affects the stability and behavior of bacterial respiration is investigated. Biological systems are inherently stochastic, with noise arising from environmental fluctuations and molecular‐level randomness. Through numerical simulations, how random fluctuations in oxygen and nutrient concentrations influence the system's stability is analyzed, particularly, the transition between limit cycles and fixed points. These results demonstrate that noise can induce a reduction in time scales, pushing the system toward a domain of fixed points, which contrasts with the noiseless case where the system exhibits a stable limit cycle. By employing statistical analysis across varying noise intensities, the likelihood of reaching the fixed domain is quantified and the area of this domain is examined under different noise conditions. These insights contribute to the broader understanding of how stochastic factors affect bacterial population dynamics, offering implications for microbial ecology and the management of bacterial processes in natural and engineered environments.",

The rationality and stability of F‐MoS 2−x are calculated by phonon spectra.

    "abstract": "Abstract Stochastic switching in resistive random‐access memories (RRAMs), while presenting challenges in digital memory applications, can be leveraged beyond von Neumann's stochastic computing and hardware security applications. In this regard, it is crucial to identify and model RRAMs where microscopic stochastic events can enable sizeable and tunable variability in macroscopic device characteristics. In this regard, chalcogen vacancy‐mediated multifilamentary switching consisting of a multitude of hotspots in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) RRAMs can be promising candidates for high‐quality, tunable stochastic sources. In this work, an efficient physics‐based model is developed to capture the behavior of stochastic switching in monolayer MoS 2 RRAMs. The microscopic origin of stochasticity, arising from clusters of sulfur vacancies transforming into metallic hotspots, is modeled using the kinetic Monte Carlo method. The rate equations designed to capture the physics of abrupt SET and gradual RESET processes provide an excellent fit to experimental data, allowing to extract key material parameters. The calibrated macroscopic model is then employed to explore multiple non‐volatile resistance states in the gradual RESET process, area scalability trends and cycle‐to‐cycle C2C variability over 100k cycles. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of HRS and LRS variability is modeled and large tunability of the distribution is demonstrated using stop voltage in RESET. Finally, it is demonstrated that these devices are excellent candidates as bit stream generators for stochastic computing applications with accuracy values comparable to an ideal source. It is envisioned that the work will induce significant interest in the deployment of 2D materials‐based RRAMs for high‐quality tunable stochastic sources.",

In this research, by analyzing the density of states curve of surface atoms in heterostructures and comparing them with atoms in the bulk material, the electronic properties of the surface atoms can be revealed. Monolayer carbon (C) atoms on cubic boron nitride (c‐BN) surface exhibit some properties of diamond‐like carbon. Conversely, the monolayer C atoms covering the Iridium (Ir) surface demonstrate distinct metallic properties. The C atoms on the surface of the 8‐layer heterostructure exhibit some properties of diamond‐like carbon. This explains why single‐crystal diamond heteroepitaxy growth on Ir film requires the bias‐enhanced nucleation process. However, on the c‐BN surface, single‐crystal diamonds can be grown directly. The method is also used to analyze the heteroepitaxy of indium phosphide (InP) on gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) on aluminum nitride (AlN), and the results have further confirmed the effectiveness.

Exploring the electronic properties such as the ‐band center () and the related catalytic properties of these materials are quite challenging due to resource consuming experiments and computationally expensive modeling of the nanoparticles. Therefore, a density functional theory (DFT) coupled recommendation system based approach is developed to predict the of the core‐shell nanoparticles. Here, the recommendation system involves completion of a core‐shell interaction matrix, where each matrix element represents the of a unique core‐shell pair. Matrix completion by predicting the interaction matrix elements is carried out using neural network. The neural network generated a low dimensional representations for each core and shell metals, which are learned iteratively to predict corresponding of the pair. The learned representations brilliantly captures the similarities and dissimilarities between metals present in shell or core. A very low train/test RMSE of 0.009/0.009 is obtained with elemental features based model. The same model is further employed to predict the ‐band width (), suggesting its transferability. This approach recommends the optimum range of / along with the combination of core‐shell metals having most efficient adsorption of species for any reaction. The results presented in this study can help experimentally design the core‐shell nanoparticles having a desired catalytic activity.",

Here, a simulation technique is described, that predicts the shifts of frequency and half bandwidth, Δ f n and ΔΓ n , of a quartz resonator operating on different overtone orders, n , induced by structured samples in contact with the resonator surface in liquid. The technique, abbreviated as FreqD‐LBM, solves the Stokes equation in the frequency domain. The solution provides the complex amplitude of the area‐averaged tangential stress at the resonator surface, from which Δ f n and ΔΓ n are derived. Because the dynamical variables are complex amplitudes, the viscosity can be complex, as well. The technique naturally covers viscoelasticity. Limitations are linked to the grid resolution and to problems at large viscosity. Validation steps include viscoelastic films, rough surfaces, an oscillating cylinder in a viscous medium, and a free‐floating sphere above the resonator. Application examples are soft adsorbed particles, stiff adsorbed particles, and a large, immobile spherical cap above the resonator, which allows to study the high‐frequency properties of the material in the gap. FreqDLBM runs on an office PC and does not require expert knowledge of numerical techniques. It is accessible to an experimentalist.",

A theoretical model is proposed that takes into account the contribution of the mechanical stresses arising due to magnetic torques applied to the particles on the part of external field. The model composite film is constructed as a layer of adjoined identical representative cells each of which is made of the PVDF polymer surrounding a single‐domain platelet ferrite particle; the calculations are performed by finite‐element method. The piezoelectric response of the model film is analyzed to find its dependence on the orientation of the particles, their positions with respect to the film boundary, and the direction of piezoelectric anisotropy of the matrix. The estimations show that, even in the case of zero magnetostriction of the ferrite, such a film is able to display the ME‐effect quite comparable with that of the conventional PVDF‐composites where the ME‐effect is driven solely by the magnetostriction of cobalt ferrite. This result points out a way to develop efficient polymer ME composites for low‐frequency applications under minimal requirements to the magnetostrictive properties of the filler.",

However, these studies were restricted to idealized, non‐physical deformations in physics engines lacking real‐world actuation like pneumatic actuation. This study addresses this gap by utilizing non‐linear finite element simulations and a custom Moore neighborhood encoding to model the deformation of primitive units for pneumatic actuation. A neural network meta‐model is trained on a large dataset of automated simulations, allowing efficient soft robot design. The efficacy of the encoding and meta‐model is demonstrated through the design of a pneumatically actuated asymmetric bending actuator. This design, though surprisingly different from conventional actuators, demonstrates high effectiveness. The meta‐model's computational efficiency enables five optimization restarts in under 3% of the time required for a single finite element simulation, highlighting the encoding's ability to efficiently explore the design space and create high‐performance soft robots.",

In this study, the piezoelectric properties of silk II β‐sheets are investigated at the microscopic level. Models existing in the literature are examined using computational methods. Shear deformation is applied to these structures, and piezoelectric coefficients are calculated. Two models provided by recent studies, Asakura A and B, form silk fibroin and are distributed with a 2:1 ratio. The overall piezoelectric property emerges with the contribution of both. It is determined that there is a six‐fold difference between the piezoelectric coefficients of the two models. This signifies that these β‐sheet crystal structure models that made up the silk has very different piezoelectric properties. Thus, the heterogeneity in the structure also exists in the piezoelectric property. Theoretically, there is a possibility to increase the silk piezoelectricity by increasing the Asakura Model A β‐sheet concentration.",

The aluminum tunnel junctions is currently regarded as one of the most high‐performing and well‐established Josephson junctions for application in quantum devices. Nonetheless, the critical current of the junctions is highly sensitive to its thickness, which significantly influences both the tunneling effect and the electrical properties of the device. This study develops a numerical model of the 3D Al/‐/Al Josephson junction employing finite element analysis. At the nanometer scale of the junction, the Cooper pairs tunneling probability of the atomically resolved electrostatic potential as well as the WKB‐equivalent barrier height of the device is calculated. The results of the model reveal a channel effect that influences the critical current of the Josephson junctions, and it is found that the probability of particles tunneling varies with the thickness of the alumina film. The probability current density distribution near the junction for various barrier thicknesses is further investigated, simultaneously employing two tunneling probability calculation methods. Moreover, a 1D square potential barrier model is also established to elucidate the quantum tunneling effect, in which the amplitude of the wave function for tunneled particles diminishes as the thickness of the potential barrier increases.",

The precise determination of complete phonon spectra and their corresponding interatomic force constants continues to present substantial computational challenges, particularly in architecturally complex material systems. In this study, using graphene as a prototypical system, theoretical derivation of the phonon dispersion relations is presented through rigorous lattice dynamics formalism. The first‐ through eighth‐nearest‐neighbor force constants in the dynamical matrix are systematically determined via a self‐consistent iterative genetic algorithm optimization framework. These derived parameters are further systematically validated through density functional theory simulations. The optimized interatomic force constants demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing both the acoustic and optical phonon branches across the entire Brillouin zone, thereby establishing a comprehensive theoretical foundation for predictive calculations of temperature‐dependent thermodynamic properties. The developed genetic algorithm optimization methodology shows significant transferability to diverse material systems, enabling precise alignment with inelastic neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy measurements.

This work presents an innovative framework that combines finite element modeling (FEM) with machine learning (ML) to improve pressure prediction and object recognition in smart gloves. FEM simulations accurately predicted contact pressure distributions during hand‐object interactions, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0184 MPa and high correlation with experimental data (Pearson's r = 0.875, Spearman's ρ = 0.971). Using this data, a backpropagation neural network (BP‐NN) was trained, significantly enhancing object classification accuracy across 21 categories. A baseline model (Model 1) performed well but struggled under noisy conditions. Model 2, incorporating noise reduction techniques such as Gaussian noise injection, grip force variability and sensor dropout, achieved a 95.05% classification accuracy, demonstrating improved adaptability to real‐world variability.

    "abstract": "Abstract Isomers of ethyltoluene are widely utilized in various industries owing to their diverse properties. However, separating the meta‐ethyltoluene (MET) and para‐ethyltoluene (PET) isomers from their mixture, often produces during industrial production, poses a significant challenge. Conventional separation methods are ineffective because of the similar properties of isomers, and the process often generates environmentally harmful by‐products. To tackle this challenge, perethylated bromopillar[5]arenes (EBP5) are employed to selectively complex with PET, facilitating isomer separation. This study investigates tuning selectivity by replacing the bromo functionality with carboxylic acid and methoxy groups (ECP5 and EMP5), utilizing density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The complexation energies confirm that EBP5 effectively attracts PET, forming a stable host‐guest complex, while MET exhibits strong stability within the ECP5 and EMP5 environments. The NCI and QTAIM studies reveal the non‐covalent interactions stabilizing the isomers within the host cavities. A 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation verifies the stability and behavior of these complexes and isomers. This findings suggest that functionalized perethylated pillar[5]arenes can selectively separate para/meta isomers, with enhanced functionality and improves encapsulation. This research contributes to the development of selective host molecules for key organic compounds.",

In order to improve its shortcomings such as poor stability and low bioavailability, it is often modified into monocarbonyl derivatives. In the present study, fluoro‐ and hydroxy‐substituted monocarbonyl curcumin derivatives (compounds 1a–1e and 2a–2e) are systematically investigated through chemical calculations. Based on the most stable geometry of each substituent, vibrational frequencies, Conceptual Density Function Theory index (CDFT), Atoms in Molecule (AIM), and molecular docking are analyzed and structure‐activity relationships (SAR) are derived. The results show that both fluorine substitution and hydroxyl substitution contribute to the reactivity of the molecules, with the hydroxyl substituents showing a stronger willingness to react. The presence of aqueous solution in the system improves the reactivity of the compounds. The results provide new and important information to further grasp the structure and properties of curcumin derivatives and also provide reference and guidance for the design and development of such drugs.",

Traditional measurement methods from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images are often labor‐intensive and subjective.

Eight machine learning models—Linear Regression (LR), k‐Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and AdaBoost—are evaluated using 5‐fold and 10‐fold cross‐validation. Performance is assessed via Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R 2 . The kNN model consistently outperformed others across three datasets: smooth nanofibers, beaded nanofibers, and a combined set. It achieves the lowest error metrics and the highest R 2 (0.950) for smooth nanofiber images while demonstrating strong generalization across morphologies. This study is among the first to integrate deep feature embeddings with machine learning for direct nanofiber diameter prediction, providing a reliable alternative to traditional methods.",

The microstructure evolution of LPBF build has been studied via imposing fixed thermal gradient and cooling rate in case of first layer, and Rosenthal equation derived temperature field in successive layers (2nd and 3rd). The formation of dendritic gamma (γ) phase is significantly influenced by local cooling rates and temperature gradients, causing solute segregation and Nb‐rich secondary phase formation in inter‐dendritic regions. Simulation of successive layers show remelting of previous layers, affecting grain orientation, and secondary phase distribution, contributing to complex thermal history, wherein the final increase in secondary/ intermetallic phases (carbides, laves, and δ) are observed at the end of 3 rd layer simulation. The developed PF model accurately predicts microstructural features of the LPBF build such as Primary (PDAS), Secondary Dendritic Arm Spacing (SDAS), and misorientation angle, validating its utility as a process control tool. Finally, EBSD analysis of the as‐built sample depicts varying grain orientations, consistent with the directional solidification, wherein the presence of fine grains and uniform distribution of intermetallic phases enhances the mechanical performance.",

Nowadays, such devices are designed in sophisticated architectures with associated models describing their behavior quite accurately. However, the different studies usually carried out on such devices mainly focus on their electrical characteristics induced by direct piezoelectric effect such as voltage gain and efficiency. In this work, a particular interest is given to the characterization of mechanical displacements induced by inverse piezoelectric effect, in a PT in vibration. For this purpose, a detailed 3D finite element analysis is proposed to examine the mechanical behavior of a Rosen type transformer made of a single bar of soft PZT (P191). At the first three modes of vibration, output voltage and mechanical displacements along the length, the width and the thickness are calculated. The amplitude of displacements varies in a range from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. The validity of the simulations is successfully confirmed by experiments carried out on a prototype using a laser interferometer. A good match is observed between simulation and experimental results despite some differences observed locally at the scanned sections. Such 3D‐simulations thus appear as a helpful tool for a better understanding of mechanical phenomena in Rosen‐type PT.",

Increasing Bi content from 0.5 to 0.6 reduces the bandgap from 1.60 to 1.43 eV, enhancing the light absorption and aligning with the optimal range for solar energy conversions. Structural analysis reveals that higher Bi substitution expands the lattice, reduces the hole effective mass, and improves the hole mobility, while the electron mobility decreases slightly. Sb 0.4 Bi 0.6 SeI demonstrates quasi‐direct bandgap characteristics attributed to Bi‐induced lattice distortion and strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC), which reduces the conduction band minimum and facilitate direct‐like electronic transitions. Enhanced absorption near the band edge and localized states contribute to higher sub‐bandgap absorption, broadening the spectral response. Reduced bandgap falls within the optimal range for single‐junction solar cells, increasing photocurrent generation. While defect‐induced recombination poses challenges, passivation and compositional tuning can optimize its performance. This study identifies the potential of Sb 0.4 Bi 0.6 SeI as a versatile absorber material in emerging solar cell architectures. The findings provide a pathway toward designing cost‐effective and sustainable materials with tailored properties for next‐generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic technologies.",

However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of complex systems, a large number of rules are often generated when complex models are constructed using the initial BRB. This results in rule base expansion and diminished modeling capability. Therefore, a multi‐dimensional rule evaluation framework is first developed in this study. The BRB is effectively screened and optimized, resulting in a significant reduction in the total number of rules and a decrease in model complexity. Furthermore, to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the simplified BRB, a composite rule activation method is introduced for model inference, and a novel evidential reasoning (ER) calculation procedure is designed. Ultimately, a projection covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (P‐CMA‐ES)‐based optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the remaining parameters of the model. The optimal model structure is selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). In this paper, through case study, the implementation of this method is demonstrated, and the effectiveness of the model in practical applications is validated.",

Employing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that under extreme pressures, amorphous graphite undergoes an irreversible transition to an amorphous diamond phase. Thermodynamic analysis confirms the first‐order nature of this sp 2 ‐to‐sp 3 transformation, with the transition predicted to occur at ≈33 GPa under experimental conditions. This transformation offers a novel pathway toward the synthesis of amorphous carbon with a high fraction of sp 3 bonding, a long‐standing challenge in materials science.

MXenes possess a combination of plasmonic characteristics and high electrical conductivity, making them an unrivaled choice for designing absorbers. In this paper, a nanostructure composed of a common MXene, Ti 3 C 2 Tx is introduced, coupled with a silver (Ag) grating embedded within a dielectric layer to enhance the plasmonic response and achieve a perfect absorber in the visible region. To optimize the performance of this nanostructure, various geometrical parameters are fine‐tuned, including the grating radius, grating center, width of the structure, thickness of the dielectric layer, and Ti 3 C 2 Tx layer. By carefully adjusting these parameters, the absorption of the structure is significantly increased, reaching up to 99.9% with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 53 nm in the visible region.",

Phosphorene, a recently emerged 2D material that has exceptional carrier mobility (≈4000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ), tunable bandgap (≈0.3 to 2 eV) and better mechanical flexibility has gained immense attention in various fields. On the other hand, MoS 2 a member of transition metal dichalcogenides possess tunable bandgap (≈1.2–2 eV), high carrier mobility (≈200 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and huge surface area making them highly suitable for a wide variety of applications.

Specifically, it can be employed in the circulatory system to locally release therapeutic agents at disease sites, minimizing systemic exposure and reducing side effects, particularly in the treatment of diseases like cancer. Previous research indicates that the design and shape of microrollers play a crucial role in safe navigation within blood vessels, with anisotropic microrollers exhibiting superiority due to favorable hydrodynamic interactions with nearby boundaries. In this study, the navigation potential of anisotropic microrollers is investigated in veins, venules, and capillaries through computational fluid dynamics analyses. These results indicate that robust locomotion is only achievable in larger vessels, such as veins. Subsequently, their performance is explored in a clinically relevant scenario – the hepatic circulation toward treating primary liver cancer or metastatic nodes of distant tumors (e.g., pancreatic cancer). Computational fluid dynamics analyses using the data from five different patients demonstrate that robust navigation can be achieved with high actuation frequencies. Overall, the findings presented in this study lay a preliminary foundation for the potential future application of surface microrollers in vivo.",

Using computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, the structure of Ir single‐atom catalysts (SACs) is analyzed across a range of oxidation states, which is influenced by electrode potential and environmental pH. The findings indicate that applying potential to Ir SAC‐supported covalent organic framework (COF) in the range of 0.5 ∼ &lt; U ∼ &lt; 1.1 can lead to the formation of an OIrOH structure, resulting in outstanding OER activity. Importantly, while applying the electrode potential is not necessary to overcome the potential‐limiting step, it is crucial for the formation and stabilization of the highly active Ir SAC structure. This work offers valuable insights to guide experimental efforts in designing high‐performance Ir SACs with enhanced OER activity.",

Defect formation energy caculations reveal that doping Nb on the Mg site is energetically favorable. Structural analysis shows that Nb doping increases in all structural parameters, attributed to the larger atomic radius of Nb compared to Mg. Electronic band structure calculations indicate a reduction in the bandgap of ML MgO, from 3.44 to 3.39 eV and 3.0 eV for 6.25% and 12.5% Nb doping, respectively. The total density of states and band structure analysis suggests a transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic behavior, along with a shift toward half‐metallic properties with Nb doping. Notably, using mean‐field theory in combination with spin‐polarized DFT, the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( T ) for 12.5% Nb‐doped MgO is predicted to be 346 K. Furthermore, optical absorption studies reveal a significant enhancement in the absorption coefficient, particularly in the visible spectrum, due to Nb doping. These findings highlight the potential of Nb‐doped MgO for applications in spintronics and optoelectronics, although further experimental validation is required to confirm these theoretical predictions.",

The lattice constants, bandgaps and bowing parameter are investigated for both corundum and monoclinic AlInO, with In‐content ranging from 0 to 100%.

    "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, which disrupt membrane integrity and contribute to neurodegeneration. Cholesterol, a key membrane component, plays a role in modulating these pathological events by stabilizing membrane structure and affecting protein dynamics. This study investigates how cholesterol influences membrane stability in the presence of Aβ1‐42, a peptide linked to AD progression. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to model a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer with cholesterol concentrations ranging from 10–50%. Aβ1‐42 is modeled to examine its interaction with these cholesterol‐rich membranes. Key parameters, including root mean square deviation (RMSD) for structural stability, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) for local flexibility, and hydrogen bonding (H‐bonding) are calculated to assess interactions between Aβ1‐42 and the lipid bilayer. Secondary structure analysis (SSA) tracked conformational changes in Aβ1‐42, focusing on transitions between alpha helices and beta sheets, which are critical for understanding peptide misfolding. Results of this study indicate that approximately (≈) 30% cholesterol concentration is optimal for enhancing peptide stability. While higher cholesterol (50%) further stabilizes the membrane, it leads to diminishing returns on peptide stability, possibly due to excessive membrane rigidity. These findings suggest that a balance between membrane rigidity and peptide flexibility is crucial for maintaining structural stability in AD.",

The research analyzes droplet distribution, contact angle changes, and maximum droplet center pressure. Results show a positive correlation between droplet equivalent diameter and distance from the pipe inlet. As condensation stabilizes, this correlation remains, while the maximum droplet center pressure negatively correlates with droplet size.

The accurately achieved reactivity parameters confirm the descent training of the model from the integrated data of organic molecules. This work confirms that chemical properties reproduced through ML approach are closely correlated with density functional theory (DFT) ‐based results, so the proposed ML approach provides reactivity information at a very cheap cost.

Results reveal that the majority of the doped GaS (MD‐GaS) exhibit thermodynamic stability. The magnetic properties of MD‐GaS nanosheets change with doping for MD = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Zn, and Se, transforming the sheets into diluted magnetic semiconductors. In contrast, doping with Sc, Cu, As, In, and Sb retains the semiconductor properties of the pristine sheet. Ge‐ and Sn‐doped GaS nanosheets show potential for 2D spintronic applications. While many dopants enhance visible light absorption, they introduce mid‐gap states or unfavorable valence band edges, making them less suitable for photocatalysis. However, As‐ and Sb‐doped GaS are promising sheets for photocatalytic Co 2 reduction and water splitting under visible light making it a potential material for clean fuel production.",

In this paper, the performance of several numerical software packages is reviewed and evaluated based on the ease of model setup, spatial dimension capability, and model accuracy. In the absence of standardized benchmark tests, a series of discharge simulations under various operating conditions, such as static and dynamic electric vehicle driving cycle loads, as well as galvanostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITTs), provide rigorous test methods to evaluate and benchmark battery modeling software packages. Two different lithium‐ion battery (LIB) parameter sets enable complete assessment of the software packages in terms of accuracy, validity, and solver sensitivity. The careful selection of actual operating condition simulations and independent evaluation tests serves as a benchmark for LIB electrochemical simulation packages and can help users of these packages develop their analyses with confidence in the validity of their results. It is hoped that this paper will serve as a reference for new and established researchers and simulation engineers in LIB simulation to gain knowledge about the capabilities of existing lithium‐ion simulation packages.",

This study aims to investigate the role of fiber length features in predicting the quality of blended yarns, particularly focusing on natural‐based fiber blends such as recycled cotton (ReCo) and Lyocell. Machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression, alongside linear and polynomial regressions, are used to predict fiber properties based on empirical data. The results show fiber length features from the Staple Diagram and Fibrogram as the most significant factors. Hyperparameter tuning has enhanced model accuracy, especially for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, showing significant reductions in error metrics. Cross‐validation is performed to ensure the reliability of the models and prevent overfitting during the predictive analysis of fiber length features. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis reveals that specific fiber length ranges have the most influence on model predictions, highlighting their importance in optimizing blended yarn properties.

Subsequently, the formation energies of oxygen vacancies on various Ru‐HEO surface states are calculated, which are typically associated with structural instability due to the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism. The results indicate that the presence of metal atoms in Ru‐HEO strengthens the Ru─O bond, possibly contributing to the long‐term stability of Ru‐HEO OER catalysts.

This is challenging due to the significant electro‐thermal coupling effect at high discharge rates. This study introduces a novel SOC estimation method that incorporates electro‐thermal coupling to enhance accuracy and robustness. An electrochemical‐thermal coupling model is developed to capture interactions between electrochemical reactions and internal heat generation. Subsequently, a reduced‐order electro‐thermal coupling model is formulated to enable real‐time co‐estimation of SOC and internal temperature. An electro‐thermal SOC estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is then designed. The proposed method's performance is validated using diverse test profiles with varying initial SOC values. Experimental results show exceptional accuracy and robustness, with a mean absolute error of 3.044% and a root mean square error of 4.658% in the challenging 15 C high‐rate pulse discharge test, despite a 40% initial SOC error.

In this article, the exotic transport features of the ‐based family of unique dumbbell‐like morphologies ( J. Phys. Chem .

A fundamental understanding from the structural and electronic points of view initially sets the tone of the analysis. The ‘light‐heavy’ admixture of primary band valleys added to the heavier secondary valley convergence entertains highly anisotropic carrier mobilities with large Seebeck coefficients. Higher weighted mobility added to substantial anharmonic scattering reduces the lattice thermal conductivity, imparting a decent thermoelectric quality factor. The applicability of acoustic deformation potential theory is thoroughly discussed and validated as sufficiently capable of yielding reasonable carrier relaxation times. Large room temperature power factors at optimum carrier concentrations lead to a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 0.81 at 300 K and nearly 1 at 900 K. All these findings critically address the waste heat management abilities of these upcoming synthesized dumbbell geometries ( J. Phys. Chem.

In addition to their diverse applications in bioimaging and biosensing, water‐soluble MPCs have shown promise as nanotherapeutics. However, in‐depth knowledge of how MPCs act as therapeutic agents remained unexplored. In this work, the inhibition mechanism of amyloid fibril growth by atomically precise gold nanoclusters functionalized with positively charged ligands, 8‐MTA (mercaptooctyltrimethylammonium) and polyphenol‐based ligands, ‐alkyl derivative of epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG) is investigated using extensive all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reveal that ligand‐coated small gold nanoclusters bind to different external sides of an amyloid fibril and stipulate its secondary structure content. Non‐covalent interactions such as electrostatic, van der Waals, –, and hydrogen bonding interactions help bind the nanoclusters in the various regions of amyloid fibril and thereby exert conformational changes on the peptides in the fibril. The pertinent atomistic insights obtained from this work will spur the design of ligand‐functionalized nanoclusters as nanodrugs that can potentially inhibit amyloid fibril growth connected to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, the fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been hindered by the poor stability and high costs of hole transport layers (HTLs) such as Spiro‐OMeTAD. 2D materials, which can be stacked via van der Waals (vdW) forces to form heterostructures, open up new possibilities for atomic‐scale engineering of perovskite devices. In this study, the electronic, optical properties of the FAPbI 3 /SnS‐vdW heterostructure are investigated using first‐principles calculations. The SnS monolayer and the FAPbI 3 surface form a stable Type‐II heterostructure with a smaller bandgap compared to their individual components. Through selective stacking of 2D‐SnS at PbI 2 or FAI interfacial atoms, the charge transfer direction is changed accordingly. The favorable interfacial polarity, smaller distance, and stronger bonding of SnS/PbI 2 interface result in a better HTL properties. Simulations demonstrate that FAPbI 3 /SnS‐based PSCs achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.30%, comparable to the traditional FAPbI 3 /Spiro‐OMeTAD structure. Moreover, interfacial effects enhance the optical absorption of the FAPbI 3 /SnS heterojunction, thus, the SnS‐based PSC exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) with an extended absorption range.

On the pristine M 2 C (M = Sc, Ti, V), HCN molecules are strongly chemisorptive to surface sites via ionic bonds with adsorption energies ranging from −3.50 to −4.40 eV. The charge density difference plot exhibits a charge accumulation around the C─H bond of HCN after adsorption, leading to its pronounced elongation. On the functionalized M 2 CO 2 surfaces, HCN molecules prefer binding to Sc 2 CO 2 via electrostatic interaction with a monodentate configuration and a high binding energy of 0.85 eV, much greater than that on other surfaces, relying on the distinguishing termination pattern of the host structure. Sc 2 CO 2 shows a relatively long recovery time of ≈235 s at room temperature, however, a high sensitivity of 306% is obtained, which is much superior to that on other investigated surfaces. A slight reduction in bandgap, i.e., 0.072 eV, originating from the down‐shift of both bonding and anti‐bonding states, is the key to this distinctive performance.

Applying the current similarity synthesis, the PDE model is translated into ODEs and the modified equations are overcome by a well‐known shooting technique.

This study models hybrid nanofluid viscosity using Radial Basis Function (RBF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and a Committee Machine Intelligent System (CMIS). A dataset of 584 viscosity data points is utilized. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Farmland Fertility Algorithm (FFA) are employed to train the RBF, while the MLP utilized Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Levenberg‐Marquardt (LM) algorithms. The CMIS is created by integrating MLP‐BR, RBF‐FFA, and RBF‐PSO networks. The AAPRE values for RBF‐PSO, RBF‐FFA, MLP‐LM, MLP‐SCG, MLP‐BR, and CMIS models are 1.7464, 1.6647, 2.6851, 2.1889, 2.1792, and 1.519, respectively. The R 2 values are 0.9689, 0.9394, 0.4794, 0.9727, 0.9404, and 0.9688, respectively, which indicates that the CMIS model with the lowest Average Absolute Percent Relative Error (AAPRE) and the highest Determination Coefficient (R 2 ) value is the most accurate model and outperforms other models in estimating viscosity, demonstrating greater accuracy than empirical and theoretical models. Sensitivity analysis showed that temperature has a significant positive impact on viscosity, while nanoparticle size has a negative effect. The CMIS model is reliable for predicting nanofluid viscosity, exhibiting a broad application range and minimal outlier data.",

The structural analysis confirms that all the studied materials crystallize in the cubic phase with space group 216 (). The phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) computations reveal dynamic and thermal stability for both compounds. In addition, the electronic structures exhibit indirect semiconducting properties, with an extensive hybridization near the Fermi level between 1s‐orbitals of hydrogen (H), and d‐orbitals of the transition metals (Rh and Ir). Furthermore, optical investigations reveal significant UV absorption, as well as a moderate refractive index and reflectivity, which can be useful in optoelectronic devices. All of the studied materials possess mechanical stability and show brittle properties. Among the compounds, KSrRhH 6 exhibits the highest gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 2.57 wt.%, while KSrIrH 6 shows a slightly lower value of 1.86 wt.%. The storage capacity decreases when the cationic atom Rh is substituted with Ir, attributed to variations in atomic radius. This comprehensive study underscores the promising potential of KSrZH 6 (Z = Rh, Ir) for both hydrogen storage and optoelectronic applications.",

Here, a combinatorial approach is developed that integrates a theoretical framework with Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the percolation behavior of penetrable rectangles by systematically exploring the effects of aspect ratio and anisotropic orientation distributions. A theoretical model incorporating a modified expression for the average excluded area is proposed, with both the model and simulations providing rigorous validation and correcting the errors in the original work. With the aid of predictive modeling and simulations, the critical area fraction and bond number have been computed by considering the aspect ratio of rectangles with a specified degree of anisotropy. These results demonstrate that the bond number in isotropic networks remains within 3.6–4.5 across a wide aspect ratio range (1–1000), in strong agreement with established benchmarks reporting convergence to 3.6 for aspect ratios above 20. Using the predicted critical area fractions, the electrical conductivity trends of two‐dimensional (2D) conductive networks are modeled by fitting power‐law curves to the reported simulation and experimental results.",

The present study uses first‐principles calculations to estimate the energy level distribution of oxygen vacancies in europium‐doped strontium aluminate while considering the valence states of the luminescent Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ centers in the emission process. The results indicate that the energy levels of the oxygen vacancies are distributed ≈ 2.5 eV for Eu 2+ and above 2.5 eV for Eu 3+ . Regardless of the charge states of the oxygen vacancies, their energy levels exhibit a relatively broad distribution owing to structural relaxation. The energy levels ε(0/1+) and ε(0/2+) of the oxygen vacancies shift toward the conduction band for Eu 3+ relative to Eu 2+ .

This study explores fullerene‐like nanocages (B₁₂N₁₂, B₁₆N₁₆, C₂₄, C₃₂) as nanocarriers to enhance HT delivery. Using DFT, QTAIM, and molecular docking, interactions between HT and nanocages are analyzed. Boron nitride nanocages, particularly B₁₂N₁₂, show the strongest binding (Eads = −25.28 kcal mol −1 in water) via Lewis acid‐base interactions, improving stability (ΔG = −11.90 kcal mol −1 ) and solubility. Carbon cages (C₂₄, C₃₂) exhibit weaker van der Waals interactions (Eads = −7.42 to −10.24 kcal mol −1 ), favoring controlled release. Electronic analyses reveal altered HT reactivity upon complexation. QTAIM confirms partially covalent B─O bonds in (BN) n = 12, 16 ‐HT systems, while carbon cages rely on dispersive forces. UV–vis spectra show redshifted peaks for BN‐HT complexes, indicating enhanced delocalization. Molecular docking demonstrates improved therapeutic effects of HT‐nanocage complexes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Many physical phenomena, such as the polarization of dielectrics and viscoelastic materials, or porous electrode/electrolyte interfaces cannot be modeled by a single relaxation time of the Debye type. To account for this fact, data analysis based on distribution functions of the Debye relaxation times (DFRT) is conventionally used. In this study, a generalized DFRT is proposed considering the Davidson‐Cole model as an elementary process instead of the standard Debye model. The distribution function can then be retrieved from the inverse of the generalized Stieltjes transform, expressed in terms of iterated Laplace transforms, applied on a given frequency function. Computable analytical expressions of the generalized DFRT are derived for some of the most known impedance (or admittance) models including the constant phase element, the Davidson‐Cole, Havriliak–Negami and the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts models. The obtained distributions will be valuable to interpret and compare with inverted frequency‐domain data using numerical methods, in addition to the usual way of equivalent circuit modeling. The proposed theory and results can be easily translated to other physical systems that are known to exhibit local frequency dispersion features.",

Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, how phonons can exhibit wave‐like interference patterns when passing through two slits in a silicon block is explored. The results indicate that phonon waves behave similarly to photons, with slit distinct interference patterns. By manipulating geometric parameters such as slit width, distance, and length, in fringe distances that align with Young's double slit formula is observed to change. Key findings include the observation of phonon interference and the sensitivity of fringe distances to geometric configurations. Although some discrepancies with theory arose due to noise in the MD simulations, these results underscore the complexity of simulating phonon behavior in nanostructures. This study demonstrates that phonon behavior at the nanoscale can mirror classical wave interference phenomena, paving the way for future work that includes conducting physical experiments for validation and ultimately aiming to engineer devices that harness phononic interference for innovative applications in thermal management, microelectronics, and quantum computing.",

Molecules characterized by large singlet–triplet gaps (Δ E S1–Tn &gt; 0.20 eV) are fluorescent OPCs and therefore could be classified as suitable for singlet‐state mediated electron transfer.

Furthermore, comparison between newly designed OPCs with reported OPCs (4CzIPN and NCz‐DPS) reveals that former have improved excited‐state redox potentials.

Initially, it has been begun with an optimized structure in terms of pillar filling ratio, pillar height, and diameter, as established in the previous study. This allows to obtain a hexagonal array of nanopillars with a surface characterized by low optical reflection. To enhance the optical absorption within the bulk of the silicon thin film, the optical scattering properties of silver (Ag) metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) has been harnessed. The integration of silver metal nanoparticles into the photonic crystal hexagonal nanopillar array involved introducing a cavity into the silicon pillar. Placing Ag MNPs near the bottom of the cavity prevented the degradation of the photonic crystal's ability to maintain low reflection within the desired optical spectrum (between 400–1100 nm). Comparison between the nanopillar hexagonal array structure with Ag MNPs and the bare silicon substrate revealed a remarkable 104.76 percent increase in optical absorption for a 1‐micron thick silicon bulk material. This triple hybrid structure exhibits tremendous potential in photovoltaic device applications, including solar cells and photodetectors, with the capacity to significantly enhance conversion efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photothermal therapy (PTT) using gold nanoparticles (GNPs) represent a promising innovation in biomedical treatment. Due to their unique optical properties, particularly surface plasmon resonance (SPR), gold nanoparticles can be activated by light to selectively destroy harmful cells, such as cancer cells, through heat generation. To enhance thermoplasmonic performance, gold nanoparticles can be combined with dielectric materials like silica (SiO₂) to form core/shell nanoparticles (). These structures show superior light‐to‐heat conversion compared to pure Au nanospheres, offering less invasive and more efficient cancer therapies. In this study, using the Finite Element Method (FEM), the optical and thermoplasmonic behavior of nanoparticles embedded in various subcellular locations—lysosome, membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellular medium is investigated. It is analyzed how structural parameters like core radius and shell thickness affect surface plasmon resonance‐induced absorption and resulting heat generation. To evaluate their photothermal efficiency, the absorption efficiency, electric field enhancement, and local temperature rise are computed. These findings show that the optical and thermal responses of nanoparticles are strongly influenced by both nanoparticle structure and cellular localization. Notably, by tuning nanoparticles geometry and choosing appropriate target organelles, one can optimize laser parameters and thermal output, enabling highly effective and customizable photothermal therapy strategies for cancer treatment.",

The optical response of the proposed PD design, operating under zero‐bias conditions, is comprehensively investigated using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations in the whole visible region (360–700 nm). The results indicate that a 10 nm Au layer in combination with a 20 nm HfO₂ layer leads to superior optical performance. Under zero‐bias conditions, the proposed design GaAs (1000 nm)‐Au layer (10 nm)‐HfO₂ (20 nm) exhibits high absorbance (A) = 0.952 a.u., quantum efficiency (η) = 0.585, and responsivity (ρ) = 299 mA W −1 at wavelength (λ) = 636.17 nm in the red band. The same design provides A = 0.808 a.u., η = 0.446, and ρ = 182 mA W −1 at λ = 506.78 nm in the green band. Further, an electrical simulation of the PD design, i.e., GaAs (1000 nm)‐Au layer (10 nm)‐HfO₂ (20 nm)–ZnO (10 nm) exhibits an ultra‐low dark current (I dark ) of 1.64 × 10 −12 A, and the corresponding detectivity (D * ) of 0.15 × 10 9 Jones in green band, and 0.26 × 10 9 Jones in red band under zero‐bias condition. These results further establish that that the proposed PD design is capable of providing superior performance compared to several recently‐reported visible region PDs. The proposed PD design with dual‐band performance provides a crucial versatility as the same design can efficiently operate across two separate spectral ranges. This capability is especially beneficial for diverse optical sensing applications that demand high sensitivity across multiple wavelength ranges.",

Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity – especially for new materials – limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials are deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz‐Ge being similar to Cz‐Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz‐Si. Various transfer learning strategies are explored, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. The results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.",

Herein, the electronic and magnetic properties of (X = S and Se) monolayers doped with (n = 1, 2, and 3) small clusters are investigated in order to introduce a new approach for the magnetism engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs). monolayers are nonmagnetic direct‐gap semiconductors. Doping with single Fe atom induces the half‐metallicity with overall magnetic moment of 2.00 and 0.08 in and monolayer, respectively. Herein, Fe impurity and its neighboring S/Se and W atoms produce mainly the magnetic moment. Meanwhile, these 2D materials are metallized by doping with single P atom. In these cases, magnetic moments of 0.71 and 0.60 , respectively, are originated primarily from P atom. The substitution of clusters leads to the emergence of magnetic semiconductor nature in monolayer formed by the semiconductor character in both majority and minority channels. Total magnetic moments of 0.99, 0.00, and 1.00 are obtained by doping with FeP, , and clusters, respectively. These values depend on the magnetic coupling between Fe atom and its neighboring S/Se and W atoms, whereas the contribution from P atom to the system magnetism is negligible. Further, the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) indicates in‐plane magnetic anisotropy of the ‐doped and monlayers, where the strength of anisotropy depends on the host monolayer and number of P atoms.

This work presents the design and analysis of a high‐performance biosensor based on a defective 1D ternary photonic crystal (TPC) for detecting acetone concentrations via refractive index (RI) changes. The TPC consists of alternating layers of Si, Nb₂O₅, and SiO₂, with a central defect layer infiltrated by water‐acetone mixtures. The transfer matrix method (TMM) is employed to investigate the transmission spectra. Detection relies on the strong correlation between the defect mode and the RI variations of the infiltrated medium.

Furthermore, the influence of graphene insertion on the sensor's performance is explored. At an incident angle of 55°, with three periods and a defect thickness of 2770 nm, the sensor achieves a maximum S of 3658.25 nm RIU −1 .

However, its non‐smooth switching operator presents challenges in parameter identification due to the nonconvex optimization involved. This paper introduces a physics‐informed hybrid neural network, namely hysteretic neural network‐long short‐term memory (HNN‐LSTM), for identifying Duhem model parameters and modeling the hysteresis nonlinearity. First, a LSTM network with an expanded input is constructed to describe the nonlinear hysteresis between input and output. The resulting LSTM sub‐model achieves universal approximation of the Duhem hysteresis and accurate estimation of the internal state. Second, a physics‐informed sub‐model, HNN, is then introduced to impose physical constraints on LSTM training by embedding Duhem model parameters into network weights. Then, by minimizing a composite loss combining numerical and physical errors, the model achieves both numerical accuracy and physical consistency. Thus, parameter identification is thereby accomplished by solving the inverse problem of the HNN‐LSTM while ensuring consistency with the original differential model. Finally, simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. This approach offers a promising solution for modeling non‐smooth systems and estimating their parameters accurately.",

The results indicate that the stability of the aggregates increases with the number of peptide chains, due to the formation of secondary structures in α‐Syn, particularly β‐sheets. Among the models studied, the tetramer is identified as the smallest stable protofibril, making it a target for ligand testing. Regarding the interaction analysis between polyphenols and α‐Syn aggregates, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that quercetin (QC) and hydroxytyrosol (HT), and genistein (GT) interact in the NAC region of the oligomer. Furthermore, the analysis of the total contacts fraction revealed that the presence of the ligand reduces the number of residue‐residue interactions within the oligomer, suggesting a global destabilizing effect on the aggregate structure. In terms of energetic parameters, QC showed the greatest destabilizing effect, followed by GT. HT, in turn, exhibited a localized destabilizing effect. Thus, the present study provides insights into the destabilization of the α‐Syn tetramer by polyphenols, which may contribute to the development of new therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

The core is characterized by a hexagonal honeycomb structure, whereas the upper and lower layers consist of FG graphene origami (Gori) metamaterial. The incompressible fluid‐microshell coupled system incorporates steady viscous forces from the fluid by utilizing time‐averaged Navier‐Stokes equations. Hamilton's principle is used to derive the system's partial differential equations, and an analytical solution is developed to examine the wave dispersion properties. The solution is validated through comparison with existing examples. The study explores how essential factors, such as foundation coefficients, material length scale, and shell geometry, influence the wave dispersion behavior. The analysis demonstrates that increasing the Gori weight fraction results in higher wave frequency and phase velocity, owing to the improved stiffness of the doubly‐curved shallow shell structure. Moreover, due to the increase in fluid pressure, which effectively enhances the dynamic stiffness of the shell, a rise in average flow velocity results in higher wave frequency and phase velocity.",

GNNs have shown a reasonable performance in the predicting properties of chemical systems. In typical applications of GNNs to chemistry‐related fields, the main objective is to create an optimal molecular representation by aggregating atomic features and pooling features in the graph. In this study, two different approaches are investigated that can possibly generate better molecular representations. First, intermolecular edges are created to predict the photochemical properties of chromophore molecules in the solution. These intermolecular edges are constructed using atomic partial charges, inspired from the fact that electrostatic interaction is the main component of solute‐solvent interaction. In the second approach, the effect of the aggregation and pooling functions is investigated. The results show that intermolecular electrostatic edges based on ground state charges prevent the GNN model from generating more effective molecular representations. On the contrary, the model demonstrated better performance when the averaging and adding operations are employed in a hybrid manner for the aggregation and pooling functions.",

The relative stability of these systems is assessed through binding energies, ligands, second‐order energy differences, and HOMO‐LUMO electronic energy gaps. The findings reveal intriguing variations in the rapid formation of planar, 2D, and 3D structures. Binding energies generally increase with larger cluster sizes, indicating that clusters gain energy as they expand. The theoretical HOMO‐LUMO gaps of the most stable MAu n (M = Ti, Pt) clusters typically decrease as the cluster size increases. Vertical electron affinity (VEA), vertical ionization potential (VIP), and chemical hardness (η) suggest that certain MAu n clusters exhibit unique properties.

This is usually done by modeling the metasurface as a combination of surface electric and magnetic polarization densities, whose parameters are determined by solving the generalized sheet transition conditions. This is a time‐consuming task, as the so‐called boundary conditions needs to be solved on a case‐by‐case basis, depending on the source polarization, angle of incidence, and intended functionality. Evermore, the task complexity increases as factors such as different media around the metasurface and more than one illumination scenario are taken into account. In this work, a general solution is provided for a uniform metasurface homogenized in terms of susceptibilities. With this model, it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the specular scattering produced by a metasurface illuminated with arbitrary polarization and angle of incidence. It is expected that the proposed model can ease the analysis and design of metasurfaces, by providing straight‐forward expressions which can be simplified by exploiting unit‐cell geometric symmetries.",

In this study, a modified SITRM‐based compartmental model is developed that integrates vaccination dynamics and a disability progression parameter (), along with treatment failure, reinfection, and awareness‐driven behavioral changes. A comprehensive mathematical analysis establishes the local stability of the disease‐free equilibrium (DFE) under suitable conditions. To simulate the nonlinear dynamics of the model efficiently and accurately, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained via the Levenberg‐Marquardt Backpropagation (LMB) algorithm is employed. The ANN is trained on numerical solutions generated by the classical RK4 method, using a data split of 85% for training, 10% for validation, and 5% for testing. Across multiple case scenarios, including DFE, endemic equilibrium, and sensitivity to key epidemiological parameters, the ANN achieves consistently low mean squared errors (MSEs) ranging from to , with regression coefficients approaching unity (). The ANN predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with reference solutions and maintain low absolute errors across all compartments. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the ANN‐LMB framework in modeling malaria dynamics and predicting severe outcomes, including neurological disability, thereby offering valuable insights for optimizing vaccination strategies and disability‐focused public health interventions.",

Mechanisms were explored using DFT+U (PBE functional, VASP code) computation. DOS patterns indicates noticeable spin polarization as transition metals are doped into lattice and various degrees of bandgap decrease and the introduction of new bands within the bandgap region. The charge density patterns indicated that the doped transition metals can form new recombination centers to inhibit the electron and hole recombination.

Through in situ annealing and cross‐sectional STEM characterization, asymmetric pore dynamics are revealed ‐ top expansion and bottom shrinkage, with a minimum aperture reduced and forming a conical geometry. Such inhomogeneous variation is proposed to be driven by substrate‐restricted molecular migration, following an energy potential gradient along the nanopore channel, distinct from the equilibrium evolution. A generalized kinetics model identifies substrate confinement as an independent variable, establishing a thickness‐dependent critical radius, validated across both single pores and pore arrays.

Utilizing a theoretical framework rooted in the effective mass approximation (EMA) and numerical simulations performed with the finite element method (FEM), the electronic states are rigorously analyzed. The analysis extends to their influence on the binding energies (BEs) of the ground and first excited states, alongside the spatial distribution of electron probability densities within the nanostructure. Subsequently, the PCS variation across a range of pressures, temperatures, polarization directions, and impurity positions is systematically examined. The findings reveal that elevated temperature and pressure profoundly impact both the energy levels and the PCS for the two transitions under investigation. Specifically, the PCS undergoes a discernible blue shift (toward higher energies) with increasing pressure. Crucially, the PCS exhibits pronounced anisotropy concerning the polarization angle. This directional sensitivity underscores promising applications in polarization‐selective optoelectronic devices and provides fundamental insights for the precise tuning of quantum dot‐based photodetectors and sensors.",

This study presents a novel PtS 2 /SiC van der Waals heterojunction designed using density functional theory. The heterojunction possesses an indirect bandgap of 1.33 eV and an interlayer electrostatic potential difference of 8.6 eV. The heterojunction efficiently facilitates the generation of photoexcited electrons and holes, driven by a work function difference of 1.439 eV, enabling the transfer of photogenerated carriers between the materials via a Z‐scheme mechanism. Electrons accumulate in the conduction band of SiC, while holes localize in the valence band of PtS 2 . This mechanism provides a high redox overpotential, which provides more energy for water splitting and spatially separates charge carriers, achieving high carrier mobility. At pH = 7 in the light, the free energy of the heterojunction is significantly reduced, demonstrating the ability to spontaneously decompose water to produce hydrogen. Additionally, within the visible light spectrum, the heterojunction reaches a peak light absorption coefficient of 3.6 × 10⁵ cm −1 at a wavelength of 387.5 nm, highlighting its exceptional potential as a photocatalytic material.",

By introducing appropriate similarity transformations, the governing equations in partial differential form are reduced to ordinary differential equations. These resulting equations are then integrated numerically using the Runge‐Kutta method of order four. This innovative approach offers both precision and computational efficiency in addressing highly nonlinear systems.

In this work, a comprehensive theoretical model is developed to explore the coupled influence of electrochemical reactions and double‐diffusion in the mixed‐mode motion of a Casson fluid within a porous, geometrically non‐uniform, and asymmetric microchannel. The formulation incorporates radiative heat transfer, internal heat generation, an oblique magnetic field, thermophoretic motion, and Brownian diffusion. Suitable non‐dimensional parameters are introduced to simplify the governing equations, enabling the derivation of an exact analytical solution for the electric potential, while the homotopy perturbation method is applied to determine velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles. Results show that increasing thermal and solutal Grashof numbers reduces the flow near one wall while enhancing it on the opposite side under electroosmotic conditions, with radiation and thermophoresis exerting significant influence on temperature distribution. Additionally, an increase in the electroosmotic velocity parameter from 1 to 2 leads to a 5.79% rise in the skin‐friction coefficient at the left channel wall. This investigation offers a novel integration of electroactive peristaltic propulsion and magnetohydrodynamic effects in a chemically reactive and radiative framework, delivering insights that can inform the development of high‐performance, energy‐efficient microfluidic systems for applications in medical diagnostics, chemical processing at micro‐scales, and thermal management in miniaturized electronic devices.",

Through multipolar decomposition, 26 ideal magnetic dipole (IMDS) and 527 ideal magnetic quadrupole (IMQS) scattering cases spanning the UV to short‐wave IR are identified. Statistical trends show that IMQS is more accessible, with Ag‐based cores and high‐index dielectric shells (e.g., GaP, Ge) maximizing modal purity. These results establish general design rules for isolating pure magnetic resonances and demonstrate that experimentally relevant material systems can realize IMMS using established nanofabrication techniques.

Using finite element method (FEM) simulations, the interplay of geometry, polarization, and leaky mode resonances (LMR) in modulating the absorption and reflection characteristics of different morphologies of silicon nanopillars (SiNPs) is investigated. Here, nanopillars with kinked morphology are introduced, a hybrid design combining features of straight and slanted SiNPs in detail, and demonstrate exceptional polarization insensitivity and superior absorption efficiency. The results reveal that kinked SiNPs outperform their counterparts by sustaining high absorption efficiency across both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations, leveraging their structural discontinuities to excite hybridized guided and leaky modes. These modes enhance light trapping by increasing the optical path length and promoting stronger light‐matter interactions. Parametric studies further emphasize the critical role of geometric factors in optimizing light absorption, including diameter, inclination angle, and interpillar distance. The kinked SiNPs may be utilized for exceptional performance as light‐trapping substrates because of the enhanced localized electric fields in their surroundings that can enhance the signal sensitivity. This enhanced functionality underscores the potential of kinked SiNPs for a variety of uses, from spectroscopy to renewable energy technologies.",

Several engineering problems, including selection of subsurface storage sites, often requires costly and complex simulations of flow fields. In this work, a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model is developed for real‐time, high‐resolution simulation of plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset derived from realistic subsurface parameters and achieves a computational speed‐up of when compared to numerical simulators used in this work, with only a minimal reduction in predictive accuracy. Super‐resolution experiments are also investigated to reduce the computational cost of training the FNO‐based models. Additionally, various strategies are proposed to enhance the reliability of model predictions, which is crucial for evaluating actual geological storage sites. This framework, based on NVIDIA's PhysicsNeMo library, enables rapid screening of sites for CCS. This work scales data‐driven models to realistic 3D systems that better reflect real‐life subsurface aquifers and reservoirs, paving the way for building next‐generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications. The workflows and strategies discussed can be easily adapted to other material systems and energy solutions, such as geothermal reservoir modeling, flow batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage.",

Since no Food and Drug Administration‐approved drugs exist to combat with Ebstein‐Barr virus, the study aims to investigate the binding properties of formerly designed ligands in dynamic environment. Thus, in addition to five ligands, study includes molecular dynamics studies of apo‐protein and DNA‐protein complex. The RMSD plots of ligand‐protein complexes revealed that while systems are reached stable states the extended loops of protein are more flexible in ligand‐protein complexes than in DNA‐protein complex. Among the ligands, B288 showed best binding properties with a binding free energy value of −58.63 kcal mol −1 which is followed by B183 with the value of −58.24 kcal mol −1 . It is defined that designed ligands B175, B183, and B288 are more favorable in blocking DNA‐protein binding than Z067 and Z108 ligands obtained from ZINC15 database. The study revealed that the binding of DNA to the EBNA1 antigen can be prevented by targeting the studied binding site of protein. Moreover, the molecular dynamics studies demonstrated the extended loop of protein which wraps up DNA closely is distorted by the ligands, which may also hamper binding of DNA to protein.",

In contrast to classic solvers that predominantly depend on normality assumptions, the framework integrates these Maxwell‐based formulations within a GARCH model structure, providing a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient alternative for risk assessment. The proposed methodology is empirically evaluated through forecasting on actual stock market data, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness in capturing tail risk dynamics. This novelty stems from the fact that, unlike the Gaussian distribution, which systematically underestimates tail events due to its thin‐tailed nature, the Maxwell distribution naturally accommodates heavier right tails and yields closed‐form expressions for both VaR and ES. This provides a new analytical alternative for risk modeling beyond classical Gaussian‐based frameworks.",

A Random Forest classifier trained on 890 curated compounds achieves superior predictive performance (AUC = 0.9458) using CDK fingerprints, enabling virtual screening of 4,564 G‐quadruplex ligands from the G4LDB. Molecular docking reveals lead compound G4L2574 exhibits stronger binding affinity (−12.11 kcal mol −1 ) to the M49I mutant Mpro than clinical inhibitor ensitrelvir (−8.92 kcal mol −1 ), with molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating enhanced complex stability and persistent hydrogen bonding.

Structural analysis shows the M49I mutation induced steric hindrance compromising ensitrelvir binding, while G4L2574 maintained critical interactions with catalytic residues His41 and Cys145.

The influence of nanoribbon width on structural stability and electronic characteristics is also examined. Bare ThNNRs exhibit metallic behavior with a zero bandgap, whereas pristine ThNNRs display semiconducting behavior, with their bandgap decreasing as the ribbon width increases. Functionalization with sensing molecules such as BF 3 , NO 2 , and CO 2 significantly alters the electronic response. In particular, NO 2 ‐ and CO 2 ‐functionalized ThNNRs undergo a semiconductor‐to‐metallic phase transition with increasing width. Sensitivity analysis reveals that sensitivity decreases with temperature, indicating an inverse relationship. Recovery time analysis shows that ThNNRs–BF 3 and ThNNRs–CO 2 configurations are minimally affected by temperature. In contrast, ThNNRs–NO 2 exhibits strong temperature dependence, with recovery times peaking at 34.13 s at 500 K.

Furthermore, a double gradient buffer layer is implemented to alleviate thermal mismatch, supported by extreme gradient boosting and an interpretive algorithm to determine CTE value of the second buffer layer as the most dominant factor. The thermal stress reduction predicted by the genetic algorithm (GA) is validated against the pre‐established simulation model in Abaqus.

The approach reproduces experimental shifts in PME for Au and Pt electrodes and provides unprecedented insights into the emergence of multiple PME values in mixed‐cation systems. The findings challenge conventional models of electrolyte structuring by revealing the presence of multiple PME values within mixed‐cation systems.

The reactive simulations reveal that increasing cross‐linking density enhances both thermal stability and ceramic yield after pyrolysis. Multiple pathways for forming siloxane oligomers are uncovered–pathways that depend on the number of unbranched units in the polymer. By simulating the release of gaseous species, the mass‐retention profiles observed in experiments are reproduced: PMSQ exhibits the highest mass retention, while PDMS is prone to substantial mass loss. Non‐isothermal simulations produce thermogravimetric studies and show that higher thermal stability and the peak of mass loss rate align with the degree of cross‐linking. Moreover, these simulations enable a kinetic analysis of TGA data, yielding an activation energy for PDMS degradation that is consistent with literature values. Finally, it is shown that PDMS domains embedded within PMSQ matrices act as sacrificial templates, carving out nanoscale voids that give rise to tailored porosity in the final SiCO ceramics. Overall, the atomistic simulations provide insights into reaction mechanisms and validate experimental trends and offer predictive guidance for tuning preceramic polymers toward tailored ceramic yields and microstructures.",

Grimme's DFT‐D3 method adds empirical dispersion corrections and performs well for molecular systems, but its reliability in solids remains uncertain. Here, DFT‐D3, including zero‐damping and Becke–Johnson variants, is systematically assessed across more than 2,000 lithium‐, potassium‐, magnesium‐, zinc‐, copper‐, and manganese‐based solid‐state binary compounds using a homegrown automated workflow integrating VASP , pymatgen , and a custom D3 interface. It is found that D3 often introduces artificial secondary minima in potential energy surfaces, particularly in metallic and densely packed solids, leading to unphysical stabilization and significant energy errors. The successor scheme D3S is also examined, and although it reduces dispersion errors relative to D3, it still produces artificial stabilization in ionic and metallic systems, indicating that its molecular‐level improvements do not fully extend to solids. Comparisons with many‐body dispersion (MBD@rsSCS) calculations show that these artifacts arise from abrupt coordination‐number‐dependent variations in the coefficients. Since the errors lack consistent correlation with structural or chemical descriptors, they remain difficult to predict. Overall, DFT‐D3 is reliable for covalent frameworks and low‐metal‐content intercalation systems but requires caution in dense, metal‐rich materials to avoid misleading overbinding.",

Additionally, the formation of new phases resulting from their combinations has become evident. This behavior may lead to potential structural modifications in the studied system. The dynamic nature of conductivity suggests that the origin of the Meyer‐Neldel energy (MNE) arises from polaron hopping through various traps due to multi‐phonon excitations. A modified version of the Correlated Barrier Hopping (CBH) model has been identified to predict the conduction paths of polarons (charge carriers) in pairs, facilitated by current transfer among localized sites at the Fermi level. A larger HOMO‐LUMO gap is likely to provide a greater resistance path for polaron conduction, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies. A schematic conduction model has been proposed to explain the nature of electrical conductivity in the current system. The rate of crystallization and nucleation may depend on the difference between glass transition temperature ( T g ) and crystallization temperatures (T CM ), which are estimated from differential scanning calorimetric study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) like WS 2 have shown immense potential for optoelectronic applications but face inherent limitations in spectral range, carrier mobility, and recombination losses. To overcome these challenges, a novel heterostructure combining WS 2 with the semimetal NiTeSe is proposed, leveraging its ultrahigh carrier mobility and near‐zero bandgap for enhanced photodetection. Through first‐principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, the electronic and optical properties of the NiTeSe–WS 2 heterostructure are systematically investigated. The hybrid system has a Schottky barrier at the interface and a smaller bandgap (0.689 eV in NiTeSe–WS 2 compared to 1.809 eV in pure WS 2 ). This helps separate charges more efficiently and absorb a wider range of light. Optical analyses reveal exceptional performance, including a 48% higher absorption coefficient (2.21 × 10⁵ cm −1 ) and 53% enhanced optical conductivity (3.91 Ω −1 cm −1 ) compared to pristine WS 2 . Device simulations reveal outstanding photoresponse performance, with a peak responsivity of 4.3 × 10 4 A W −1 and an external quantum efficiency of 1.06 × 10 5 %, representing a significant enhancement compared to pristine WS 2 . These results establish the NiTeSe–WS 2 heterostructure as a transformative platform for next‐generation photodetectors, offering unprecedented sensitivity, spectral versatility, and speed for applications in communication, imaging, and sensing technologies.",

In this study, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate the effect of the transition metals (TM) decoration on the C 2 N for Hg 0 removal applications. These findings indicate that the adsorption energy of Hg 0 on the C 2 N surface is low (−0.16 eV), however, the Mn, Fe, and Co atoms decoration on the C 2 N monolayer can enhance the adsorption energy. Specifically, the Fe@C 2 N exhibits the highest Hg 0 adsorption energy. The work function of the C 2 N monolayer increases after the adsorption of the Hg 0 and TM, due to the surface charge density redistribution. The impact of the Hg 0 coverage and the number of the Fe atoms on the adsorption energy is also studied. The optimal number of the Hg 0 atoms adsorbed on the Fe@C 2 N is two, while the Fe 3 cluster decorated on the C 2 N monolayer can accommodate three Hg atoms. The presence of the CO molecule cannot affect Hg 0 adsorption on the Fe@C 2 N, but the presence of the H 2 O molecule causes the surface to bend. This study can provide insight into the application of the C 2 N monolayer for Hg 0 removal and provides a deep understanding of the adsorption process.",

This work investigates the Mott transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three‐orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two‐site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, an analytical estimate is provided for the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. An analytical estimate of the single‐site von Neumann entanglement entropy is also provided. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. These calculations are extended to their cluster version to incorporate short‐range, spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.",

This research employed a Machine Learning‐Based Quantitative Structure‐Activity Relationship (ML‐QSAR) strategy to discover new inhibitors. Using 510 known inhibitors, predictive models—Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)—were developed. A major result was the superior performance of the PubChem fingerprint‐based ANN model, which achieved an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.9743 on the training set and 0.8059 on the test set, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This optimized model then screened central nervous system (CNS) and targeted libraries, using Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) filtering.

Proper surface passivation utilizing 2D perovskite materials, in conjunction with appropriate electron and hole transport layers, metal‐semiconductor contacts, and reduced defect density in absorber layer, may address these challenges. This study presents the proposal and simulation of a control device lacking a passivation layer, specifically FTO/TiO 2 /FAPbI 3 /PEDOT:PSS, alongside a target device featuring a 2D passivation layer of cyclopropylcarbamidine hydrochloride (CPAH), denoted as FTO/TiO 2 /FAPbI 3 /2D‐CPAH/PEDOT:PSS, and a two‐terminal (2T) monolithic tandem solar cell (TSC) configured as FTO/TiO 2 /FAPbI 3 /2D‐CPAH/PEDOT:PSS/IZO/n‐nc‐SiO x /i‐a‐Si:H/n‐c‐Si/i‐a‐Si:H/p‐nc‐Si:H.

Due to the asymmetric structure of tetrapod NPs, the polymer motion is faster compared to spherical and dumbbell NPs, respectively by creating more free volume around the NPs. This has been substantiated by the stronger local ordering of polymer chains around spherical NPs, where the simple geometry promotes tighter packing. In contrast, the complex architecture of tetrapod NPs reduces local ordering, introduces geometric frustration in the surrounding polymer matrix, leading to less efficient packing and more free volume, which enhances polymer mobility. Additionally, films with holes are healed faster in a polymer nanocomposite with tetrapod NPs than the other architecture.",

The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period , measurement distance , and feedback location of the controller. Upon increasing the feedback cycle time, the engine transitions from a high non‐equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state.

Theoretical predictions of thermal conductivity based on phonon spectra are limited as they require significant computational resources. However, recently, universal machine learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) have emerged, which allow fast and accurate prediction of interatomic forces and, consequently, the phonon spectrum. In this study, phonon spectra, Grüneisen parameters, and lattice thermal conductivities of double half‐Heusler alloys Hf 2 FeNiSb 2 and Ti 2 FeNiSb 2 are investigated using established ab initio techniques and the recently developed UMLIP MACE. The results from various methods for calculating lattice conductivity, including solving the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, the Debye–Callaway method, and the Slack formula, are compared. It is demonstrated that a pretrained UMLIP based on the MACE architecture can accurately predict phonon spectra and lattice thermal conductivity of double half‐Heusler alloys without requiring significant computational resources. It is shown that acoustic phonons in Hf 2 FeNiSb 2 and Ti 2 FeNiSb 2 exhibit strong anharmonicity, which causes low lattice thermal conductivities (1.4 W (m·K) −1 for Ti 2 FeNiSb 2 and 1.9 W (m·K) −1 for Hf 2 FeNiSb 2 at 900 K).",

Besides enhanced electric performance, graphene can also have a role in the resistance of silicon against cracking. Here, the influence of depositing graphene on the silicon surface, on the fracture properties of silicon, is investigated. To pin‐point the influence of graphene, fracture properties estimated from molecular dynamics simulations of three different cases in uniaxial tension are compared. In the first case, the fracture properties of silicon alone are estimated in relation to different initial defect sizes. Second, the same simulations are repeated by depositing graphene on the silicon surface. Atomic interactions in the composite structure are modeled using the combined adaptive inter‐molecular reactive empirical bond order (AIREBO) and Tersoff potential functions. Improvement of about 780% in the Young's modulus of silicon is achieved after coating with graphene. Furthermore, to study the influence of realistic initial defects in graphene, a third set of simulations is considered by repeating the previous tests but with initial cracks through graphene and silicon. Predictions show that graphene can be highly beneficial in strengthening and repairing micro‐cracked silicon to decrease electrical power losses caused by cracks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study introduces a more scientific comparison method to obtain an effective exhaust heat exchanger in a thermoelectric generator (TEG) system when recycling the waste heat from an engine exhaust, and evaluate the performance of different kinds of exhaust heat exchangers. Moreover, the effect of the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics on the thermoelectric performance and the dimensional optimization characteristics are analyzed. A complete numerical TEG model using the finite element method is formulated with three common plate‐type exhaust heat exchangers (i.e., smooth, offset‐strip fin, and corrugated louvered fin types) taken as examples. The results show that it is more scientific and recommended to evaluate the heat exchanger performance by comparing its maximum net power with its separate optimal heat exchange size taken for different heat exchanger types. In this study, the corrugated louvered fin type has obvious advantages. The dimensional optimization results for different heat exchanger types are also presented herein. The method used and the results obtained provide guidance in achieving an efficient exhaust heat exchanger.",

The CG model, parametrized in the melt, shows remarkable transferability properties in the crystalline phase.

A topology optimization algorithm based on the evolutionary topology optimization method to design omnidirectional bandgaps on demand is proposed. Considering an asymmetric simple cubic lattice, large bandgaps between any two neighbor bands are successfully realized and novel 3D photonic structures obtained. The topology‐optimized designs have a uniform bicontinuous character, which originates from the orthogonal distribution of electric fields at the bounds of the bandgaps. The distribution of the dielectric material follows the directions of the wave vectors of the maximum frequencies at the lower bounds. Consequently, the macroscopic effective properties, such as permittivity, exhibit corresponding directionality. The isotropy of effective permittivity indicates the flatness of the lower bound and photonic crystals with large bandgaps tend to have isotropic effective permittivity.",

While the contemporary crypto systems, relying on the premise of abstract mathematical one‐way functions, are relatively difficult to decipher with reasonable and/or finite resources, the situation is bound to change with the advent of quantum computers, necessitating physically unclonable entropy sources. As such, inspiration is drawn from the disorder that is prevalent in nature and inherent to biological systems for designing disruptive mechanisms for cryptographic key generation. It is demonstrated that the spatiotemporal dynamics of an ensemble of living organisms such as T cells can be used for maximum entropy, high‐density, and high‐speed key generation. Further, such biology based one‐way functions are oblivious to any mathematical representations and are computationally expensive to decipher even if an adversary has an exhaustive knowledge of the key generation mechanisms, which include cell type, cell density, key sampling rate, and sampling instance. The introduction of such biological one‐way functions can greatly enhance the ability to protect information in the post quantum era.",

As a testbed for that comparison, the α‐polymorph of quinacridone is chosen. This system is particularly well suited for the purpose, as α‐quinacridone intermolecular interactions in distinct crystallographic directions are dominated by the three mechanisms most relevant in organic semiconductors: π‐stacking, H‐bonding, and van der Waals stacking. Density‐functional theory‐based simulations yield a comparably complex band structure, which provides the means for demonstrating shortcomings of commonly applied approaches. These include the estimation of transport properties based on bandwidths and the calculation of electronic transfer integrals considering molecular dimers. As a particularly promising alternative, the fitting of suitably complex tight‐binding models to the DFT‐calculated bands in the entire Brillouin zone is proposed. These fits bear the advantage of directly producing intermolecular coupling constants for all relevant neighboring molecules as input parameters for hopping and dynamic disorder models. They also yield an analytic expression for the electronic bands. These allow the extraction of parameters relevant for band‐transport models (like group velocities and effective masses) in the entire Brillouin zone.",

According to mean‐field theories, the minimum number—or alphabet—of distinct monomers necessary to achieve such designability is directly related to the conformational entropy ω of compact polymer structures. Here, a computational strategy to calculate this conformational entropy is introduced and thus predict the minimum alphabet to achieve designability, for a generalized heteropolymer model. The comparison of the predictions with previous results proves the robustness of the approach. It is quantified for the first time how the number of directional interactions is critical for achieving the designability. The methodology that is introduced can be easily generalized to models representing specific polymers. A comparison between conventional polymers monomers are provided, and it is predicted that polyurea, polyamide, and polyurethane residues are optimal candidates to be functionalized for the experimental synthesis of designable heteropolymers. As such, our method can guide the engineering of new types of self‐assembling modular polymers, that will open new possibilities for polymer‐based materials with unmatched versatility and control.",

A novel computational approach based on molecular dynamics, which is able to predict the structure of nanoscale aggregates of organic small molecules on substrates as a function of growth and processing conditions, is presented. In the simulation protocol proposed, molecules are progressively added to the substrate, one by one, reproducing vacuum thermal deposition processes. The simulation parameters affect the structure of the configuration, and formation of molecular aggregates is spontaneously observed upon reaching a critical molecular density at the interface. Suitable simulation parameters allow to access different molecular aggregation morphologies on substrates, including crystalline phases, matching the structural variability observed in real fabrication conditions. This approach is benchmarked by simulating the morphology of aggregates of N , N ′‐ditridecylperylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI‐C13), a prototypical n‐type semiconductor for organic electronics, on graphene, in different growth conditions. Simulations predict structural features of aggregates of PTCDI‐C13 on graphene that are in excellent agreement with experiments and, at the same time, provide a rationale and quantitative relationship between molecular structure and observed aggregation morphologies.",

FN organization into fibrils and then fibrillogenesis can be induced with the right substrate, such as poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA), on which FN becomes extended. Interestingly, the almost identical polymer poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), which has one less methylene bridge (─CH 2 ─), does not cause fibrillogenesis. To investigate the difference in FN behavior on PEA and PMA, the two substrates are modeled using ethyl acrylate (EA) and methyl acrylate (MA) functionalized self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs). It is confirmed experimentally that the EA and MA SAMs exhibit a similar behavior in vitro to the polymers in terms of fibronectin fibrillogenesis, domain exposure, and cell adhesion. All‐atom molecular dynamics simulations of the FNIII 9‐10 domains interacting with each SAM show the adsorption of these two domains on EA SAMs and no adsorption on MA SAMs. Consistently, the experiments show that FN fibrillogenesis takes place on EA SAMs but not on MA SAMs. It is found that the extra methylene group in the EA headgroup leads to more motion within the headgroup that results in a markedly less dense hydration layer, which facilitates FN fibrillogenesis.",

The thickness of each layer is required to be subwavelength for effective medium theory (EMT) to be applicable. Therefore, each layer should be thin, forcing the aspect ratio to become extremely high. This requirement makes the fabrication of vertical HMMs difficult. Thus, it is important to determine the limit of the layer thickness for the realization of vertical HMM. In this study, the critical layer thicknesses of vertical HMMs are investigated numerically at the wavelengths of 400, 500, 600, and 700 nm. It is concluded that the critical layer thicknesses for both vertical and horizontal HMMs depend on the permittivity along the perpendicular direction of the layers. The maximum critical layer thickness of vertical HMMs, with a value of 0.22, is produced by a structure composed of gold and silicon dioxide at the wavelength of 500 nm, while the critical layer thickness tends to be smaller if silver is employed. It is believed that this study can provide a useful database as quantitative indicators which can be exploited in designing nanostructures using EMT.",

Moreover, an indirect‐to‐direct bandgap transition, and a band alignment transition can be achieved by applying the perpendicular external electric fields to the vdW heterostructures. In addition, the two built heterostructures have a good optical absorption (10 4 ), a broad optical absorption, and one competitive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The results also show that the PCE of the MoS 2 /BSe heterostructures can be improved by increasing the number of BSe layers (11.63% for MoS 2 –2BSe and 13.55% for MoS 2 –3BSe).

By using plane wave‐based density functional theory, 2D haeckelite structured so‐MoS 2 is explored as an appealing anode for lithium‐ion batteries/Na‐ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). The square MoS 2 provides multiple numbers of Li/Na binding sites with high adsorption energies. The computed diffusion pathways and ion migration barriers on the surfaces of the so‐MoS 2 probe that the diffusion process is ultrafast in nature. Moreover, at maximum Li/Na concentration, so‐MoS 2 gives rise to an electrode that manifests a larger theoretical specific capacity of 670 mAh g −1 both for Li and Na storage, equivalent to that of h‐MoS 2 . The lithiation/sodiation‐induced voltage range of the so‐MoS 2 is quite feasible to be utilized as the anode, which is another vital factor influencing the performance of the LIBs/SIBs.

This work studies the OH ⋆ stretching vibration from the gas phase for OH ⋆ ‐wn (w = water, n = 0–5) clusters to the bulk phase for OH ⋆ ‐w31 via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with B3LYP‐D3 and the maximally localized Wannier function scheme. The infrared spectrum of pure liquid water reveals from an AIMD simulation with 32 water molecules a characteristic bulk phase. The OH ⋆ stretching vibration is continuously red‐shifted from the gas phase to liquid water. This fact is supported by static DFT and RI‐MP2 calculations. A comparison of Wannier and radical Voronoi tessellation spectra leads to the same result for all clusters, which implies the absence of delocalized electrons. Despite the use of van der Waals radii, the Voronoi approach is able to distinguish between strong and weak hydrogen bonds, emphasizing the flexibility of this approach toward different hydrogen bond types. The stretching vibration of the OH ⋆ in the gas phase appears as a doublet due to the coupling of rotation and stretching.",

The present study explores the possibility of achieving electrical poling in a material, purely by mechanical means, by virtue of flexoelectricity and thereby harnessing the potential of coexistence of the two phenomena. A theoretical investigation on a functionally graded ferroelectric material sample of square shape with barium titanate and polyvinylidene fluoride as its constituents is conducted in this direction using isogeometric analysis based computational framework. Applied mechanical load on the material results in varying magnitude of electric field inside the material, which in some fraction of the material reaches a magnitude sufficient enough to yield a permanent poling. Simulation results suggest that it is possible to achieve poling of up to 75% of the material volume. This partially poled material is later considered for its contribution in the total electromechanical coupling of the material. The combination of piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects is found to enhance the equivalent piezoelectric coefficient in converse electromechanical (by up to 90%) coupling while a detrimental effect is observed in direct equivalent piezoelectric coefficient (by up to 89%) due to this combination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Borophene‐based nanocomposite is envisioned as a highly promising electrode material for nanoscale electronic devices such as light‐emitting diodes, organic solar cells, and field emitters. Therefore, engineering the work function of borophene to an optimal value is crucial for maximizing both conversion efficiency and device performance. A first‐principles density functional theory is employed to investigate the effects of Cs decoration on the structure, electronic properties, and work function of α‐borophene. The results indicate that Cs decoration effectively reduces the work function of α‐borophene (4.16 eV) to 3.05–0.11 eV at varying Cs concentrations, superior to those obtained in previous studies for Li (or other metal atom) decoration. Notably, work functions of all (but one) optimized Cs‐decorated α‐borophene configurations are lower than those of the commonly used electrode materials, Mg and Ca. Additionally, this study comprehensively investigates factors contributing to the work function reduction of Cs‐decorated α‐borophene relative to α‐borophene. Further, the results indicate that Cs decoration is a simple and effective method for decreasing the work function. Therefore, Cs‐decorated α‐borophene nanomaterials can be potentially utilized as cathode materials in electronic devices due to their metallic character and extremely low work functions.",

Specifically, this method demonstrates that ML algorithms can distinguish hidden and valuable feature information such as different gas molecules from surface‐charged activated carbon fibers. The feature information used for ML is obtained by measuring the impedance and fitting the measured values to an equivalent circuit model. The mixed gases are classified using such feature information to train various automatic classifiers. The collected data consist of the resistances and capacitances extracted from best fitting results in Cole–Cole plots, and they are 5D vectors. The data processed with unsupervised learning are clustered, evaluated with Silhouette scores, and then the unique hidden patterns of individual gases in the mixed gases are obtained. When the supervised ML algorithm, k ‐nearest neighbor classifier, is used for the analytical features, all combinations of gases have 94% classification accuracy, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed technique.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Various ferroelectric simulation models have been developed in recent decades in order to study the mechanisms and predict the behaviors of ferroelectrics by simulating their hysteresis loops. Conventional ferroelectrics have wide optical band gaps (&gt;2.7 eV), making them difficult to respond to visible light. Although their ferroelectricity can be affected by higher‐energy radiation like ultraviolet, little attention is paid to the development of their models incorporating light‐dependent factors. However, in recent years, narrow band gap (&lt;2.5 eV) ferroelectrics have been discovered and are increasingly researched. These special ferroelectrics effectively absorb visible light and hence exhibit strongly light‐dependent ferroelectricity, triggering potentially a broad range of applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a model for these ferroelectrics in order to predict their behavior under visible light. Such a model is also needed to improve the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between light and domains. In this paper, a ferroelectric simulation model based on the Jiles–Atherton theory considering light dependence is developed for the first time, and its accuracy is validated by experiments. The model shows an average error of 7.5% on polarization values compared to experimental results and thus can be employed to reliably predict photo‐induced ferroelectricity.",

The electronic transport properties of the molecule are theoretically investigated by density functional theory (DFT) combined with non‐equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). The calculated current–voltage curves show that the molecule system produces a low resistance only when the ultraviolet (UV) light and acid solution are applied, otherwise, a high resistance will be obtained. Therefore, the molecule system can behave as a single‐molecule AND logic gate which can be controlled by two orthogonal inputs: protonation and light.

In contrast, the atomic or molecular scatterers in conventional optical materials form a homogeneous distribution on the scale of the wavelength. In this paper, the transition between homogeneous and heterogeneous materials is investigated. To this end, a procedure is introduced that allows for retrieving reliable refractive index values from full wave optical numerical simulations of the underlying multibody scattering problem. Using this procedure, it is shown that the concept of an effective refractive index breaks down on multiple levels as a material transitions out of the homogeneous regime. These findings allow for quantifying how novel dispersion‐engineered nanocomposites for bulk optical applications must be designed and show that Maxwell–Garnett‐type effective medium theories are accurate tools for the design of nanocomposites. The procedure can be readily generalized to other types of scatterers, including atoms and molecules and hence guide the design of different kinds of novel materials.",

The geometrical structures of BeMF 3 are fully relaxed and stabilities are confirmed by phonon dispersions. Transport properties are determined by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory with accurate band structures. The results show that the regions of the large Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivity are overlapped with those of the small electronic thermal conductivity for the n‐ and p‐type systems and especially true for BeYF 3 , which brings about the enhanced ZT values. Moreover, the small lattice thermal conductivities also contribute to the large ZT values.",

The feasibility and flexibility to control electromagnetic waves by reflective metasurfaces depend on the recognition of their physical properties by researchers. As for bianisotropic reflective metasurfaces, however, the effective‐medium characteristics cannot be appropriately described by conventional methods, which entail both transmission and reflection coefficients. Here, a robust method based on simplex S ‐parameters is proposed to retrieve constitutive effective parameters (CEPs) for bianisotropic reflective metasurfaces. By illuminating the transverse electric‐polarization plane waves on a split‐ring unit cell normally and obliquely, the CEPs can be calculated with only S 11 parameters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval results, an analysis of small incident angles is employed to examine the consistency of both the x ‐ and y ‐directions effective impedance and determine the accurate range of the incident angles. Moreover, the sensitivity of the retrieval results to S ‐parameters is also sufficiently discussed. This method is beneficial for the applications of one‐side complex materials, e.g., dual‐function reflective metasurfaces, multichannel reflectors, excitation of spoof space plasmon polaritons, and ground‐penetrating‐radar applications.",

Introducing nitrogen dopant can regulate the morphology and improve the adsorption capacity of specific species. Due to the amorphous structure, it is difficult to understand the relationship between structural features and adsorption performance through atom‐based simulation. Here, a series of nitrogen‐doped amorphous carbon (N‐aC) models is built through reverse Monte Carlo method. The uptakes of three common gases, i.e., CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 are estimated in each constructed framework by using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC). Deep neural network is trained based on the simulated adsorption capacity with nitrogen content, surface area, pore size, atomic charge, and other factors. Through the data‐driven approaches, the adsorption capacity and the selectivity of three gases are predicted. The simulation in this study shows that the nitrogen content has less influence on the capacity and selectivity than the structural parameters, while nitrogen doping may improve CO 2 loading and separation selectivity in the nanopores with pore size close to gas molecules. This work is helpful in constructing amorphous carbon structures for further simulation and understanding the influence of various features on gas separation.",

Many intervention strategies are utilized (e.g., masks, social distancing, vaccinations), but officials making decisions have a limited time to act. Computer simulations can aid them by predicting future disease outcomes, but they also require significant processing power or time. It is examined whether a machine learning model can be trained on a small subset of simulation runs to inexpensively predict future disease trajectories resembling the original simulation results. Using four previously published agent‐based models (ABMs) for COVID‐19, a decision tree regression for each ABM is built and its predictions are compared to the corresponding ABM. Accurate machine learning meta‐models are generated from ABMs without strong interventions (e.g., vaccines, lockdowns) using small amounts of simulation data: the root‐mean‐square error (RMSE) with 25% of the data is close to the RMSE for the full dataset (0.15 vs 0.14 in one model; 0.07 vs 0.06 in another). However, meta‐models for ABMs employing strong interventions require much more training data (at least 60%) to achieve a similar accuracy. In conclusion, machine learning meta‐models can be used in some scenarios to assist in faster decision‐making.",

The only intrinsic property of the elastic tail that governs the form and rate of wave propagation along its length is the bending stiffness. Such traveling wave motion is performed by spermatozoa, which possess a tail that is characterized by intrinsic variable stiffness along its length. In this paper, the passive bending stiffness of the magnetic nanoparticle‐coated flagella of bull sperm cells is measured using a contactless electromagnetic‐based excitation method. Numerical elasto‐hydrodynamic models are first developed to predict the magnetic excitation and relaxation of nanoparticle‐coated nonuniform flagella. Then solutions are provided for various groups of nonuniform flagella with disparate nanoparticle coatings that relate their bending stiffness to their decay rate after the magnetic field is removed and the flagellum restores its original configuration. The numerical models are verified experimentally, and capture the effect of the nanoparticle coating on the bending stiffness. It is also shown that electrostatic self‐assembly enables arbitrarily magnetizable cellular segments with variable stiffness along the flagellum. The bending stiffness is found to depend on the number and location of the magnetized cellular segments.",

Artificial neural network (ANN)‐based FSD method has strong fault tolerance but it looks like a black box and lacks the interpretability to the diagnosis outputs. In addition, when the topology of power systems changes, the ANN structure needs to be reconstructed and retrained, and thus has low adaptive capability. In order to tackle these challenges, in this paper, an ANN‐based FSD method by constructing universal transparent diagnosis models is proposed. The diagnosis models are constructed for the transmission line, transformer, and bus types rather than for a specific power system section. They can express the logical relations among sections, protective relays (PRs) and circuit breakers (CBs) clearly and intuitively. In addition, fuzzy values are used to model the uncertainties of PRs and CBs, and to determine the inputs of diagnosis models. Furthermore, the differential evolution algorithm is employed to optimize the network parameters of diagnosis models. The proposed method is verified on the IEEE 30‐bus test system and an actual local power system in Jilin Province of China.",

Systematic approach includes deterministic and probabilistic framework for optimal planning, scheduling, management, and assessment of HES. During the initiation stage, major components of the HES are identified as solar, Li‐ion batteries and biomass to enable cross‐sectoral participation whereas electric vehicle (EV) charging to promote smart electric‐mobility. Through stage‐wise data collection, processing, and training, hourly solar‐radiation historical data is classified into three seasons through kernelized space‐vector approach. Similarly, probabilistic assessment of EV arrival rate and charging requests are estimated through historical charging data. Based on initial system architecture, deterministic approach includes objective function formulation and its optimal solution through aggrandized class topper optimization (ACTO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and JAYA algorithm. The objective function is realized through upper‐level economic problem and lower‐level technical sub‐problems. Analyzing the convergence characteristics, the optimal system dynamics and capacity estimated using ACTO is considered as the best with a minimum cost of energy of Rs. 4.235 per kWh.

However, the existing metasurfaces are mainly designed to control the incident waves. Herein, a coding‐feeding metasurface (CFMS) with two functions of dual‐band emission and diffusion for incidences simultaneously is proposed. The zigzag emission patch and two arc‐split triangle patches for polarization conversion are nested together on a shared aperture of a unit cell for CFMS. The genetic optimization algorithm is introduced for diffusion. A prototype is fabricated and measured to validate the proposed CFMS with dual‐function. The experimental results agree well with the simulated data, which verify the diffusion and emission for CFMS. The CFMS with the lightweight, compact, and low profile has the potential applications in imaging, detection, and wireless communication systems for stealth aircraft.",

Herein, the photophysical properties of newly proposed organic TADF molecule: [4‐(9,9‐dimethyl‐9,10‐dihydroacridine) phenyl] (pyridin‐4‐yl)‐methanone (PyB‐DMAC), are theoretically investigated by using the quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics method. The photophysical performance dependency of PyB‐DMAC molecule on its geometrical and electronic structures, and aggregation effects are systematically analyzed. The calculated fluorescence quantum efficiencies are in good agreement with the experimental results, for instance, the calculated fluorescence efficiency of 61.2% (exp. 49%) for PyB‐DMAC molecule in the crystal phase. Based on these investigations, novel organic TADF molecules can be designed by balancing the singlet–triplet energy gap (Δ E ST ) and transition dipole moment. Sixteen unexplored candidates are screened with similar structures to PyB‐DMAC molecule, while two new TADF organic molecules (PyBF‐DMAC and OSOF‐DMAC) are selected with enhanced luminescence performance. The newly designed TADF molecules reveal lower reorganization energies and reduced nonradiative decay rates. The simulation results exhibit that their luminescence quantum efficiencies in toluene solvent and amorphous state are as high as 63.7%, 53.2% and 90%, 97.4%, respectively.",

In this study, our introduced numerical methodology not only incorporates the effects of surface residual stress and surface tensile stiffness based on the Gurtin–Murdoch surface elasticity but also takes into account the bending stiffness of nanosurfaces in the numerical analysis. The computational results reveal that the stress concentration in nanoporous metallic materials is affected by the void geometry and is enhanced by the surface bending stiffness. In addition, the effect of void geometrical parameters on the elastic properties of nanoporous metallic metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio is studied and the mechanism of surface tensile/bending stiffness is revealed in detail. The results show that the surface bending stiffness increases the effective Young's modulus of nanoarchitected metallic materials with negative Poisson's ratio and randomly distributed nanopores.",

The nonclassical effects associated with the collective motion of free electrons in metals of the system are investigated by a nonlocal hydrodynamic (HD) model. Due to the HD model, three types of interfaces, that is, the dielectric–dielectric interface, the dielectric–metal interface, and the metal–metal interface, are distinguished. The scattering of light at these interfaces is described by Boundary Integral Equations (BIEs), which are constructed by using the surface equivalence principle, the concept of the Green' function and the interface conditions. The BIEs are numerically solved by the boundary element method (BEM) for 3D nanoparticles of arbitrary shapes. To validate, the computed results are first quantitatively contrasted with analytical solutions from the Mie theory for spherical core–shell structures, with good agreements being demonstrated in both the near field and the far field. Then, a qualitative study is performed for dimers consisting of spheres with various gap sizes for both the classical local response model and the nonlocal HD model.

A coupled numerical model is built to analyze the flow pattern, mixing behavior, residence time distribution (RTD), and mixing performance of the 3D micromixer. Helical elements inside could greatly enhance a secondary flow and induce chaotic advection around. Dean vortices are observed in the micromixer, enormously shortening the RTD and promoting the related mixing effect. Furthermore, the effects of various geometric parameters are systematically investigated to optimize the performance of this 3D micromixer. The optimized micromixer shows excellent mixing ability over wide Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2333.3, with an efficiency of over 94%. In addition, the numerical results are proved well consistent with analytical and experimental data correspondingly.

In the current approach the phase front is modeled as diffuse field, and its propagation is shown to be described by the advection equation, which reduces to the level‐set equation when the transformation proceeds only to the interface normal direction. The propagation is considered as thermally activated process in the same way as in chemical reaction kinetics. In addition, connection to the Allen–Cahn equation is made. Numerical tests are conducted to check the mathematical model validity and to compare the current approach to sharp interface partitioning and diffusion model. The model operation is tested in isotropic 2D plane strain condition for austenite to ferrite transformation, where the transformation produces isotropic expansion, and also for austenite to bainite transformation, where the transformation causes invariant plane strain condition. Growth into surrounding isotropic austenite, as well as growth of the phase which has nucleated on a grain boundary are tested for both ferrite and bainite formation.",

Nevertheless, the selection of components for 2D OIHPs with target bandgap is still challenging. To address this issue, a collaborative machine learning model to screen promising 2D OIHPs materials with tailored bandgap is established. Based on the high‐throughput screening via machine learning model, 18 materials with bandgap of 0.9–1.6 eV are obtained to meet the requirement of Shockley–Queisser theory. And considering the application of weak light indoor, 30 candidates with bandgap of about 2.0 eV are also screened out successfully. The prediction results are verified to be reliable by comparing with the published results. Moreover, the Shapley Additive exPlanation and statistical analysis indicate that the electronegativity of the X site, the electronegativity of B site, the vertical ionization potential of A site, and the number of inorganic layers play decisive roles in the prediction of bandgap. This collaborative prediction combining with interpretable strategies can achieve rapid and accurate prediction of bandgap, thus accelerating the development of the 2D OIHP materials in various applications.",

These materials are semiconductor in nature having indirect band gap 1.40 (1.69 eV) for PdO 2 (PtO 2 ) monolayers. These materials are chemically as well as dynamical stable. The observation of a sharp peak in the vicinity of the Fermi level indicates a high value of the Seebeck coefficient ( S ). The calculated value of S is 2269 (2734) µV K −1 with respect to n (p)‐type doping at carrier concentration of 1.12 (2.33) × 10 13 cm −2 for PdO 2 (PtO 2 ) monolayer at 300 K. Calculations reveal a lattice thermal conductivity ( κl) of 15.85 and 12.41 Wm −1 K −1 for PdO 2 and PtO 2 monolayers, respectively at room temperature. Monolayer PtO 2 shows a larger S and smaller k as compared to PdO 2 . Due to the maximum value of power factor and minimum value of lattice thermal conductivity, ZT for n‐type doped PtO 2 monolayer (1.04) is higher than PdO 2 monolayers (0.87). The findings provide a blueprint for evaluating the thermal energy conversion efficiency of XO 2 monolayers for potential thermoelectric applications.",

Here, the pycroscopy ecosystem of packages is introduced, an open‐source python‐based ecosystem underpinned by a common data model. The data model, termed the N‐dimensional spectral imaging data format, is realized in pycroscopy's sidpy package. This package is built on top of dask arrays, thus leveraging dask array attributes, but expanding them to accelerate microscopy relevant analysis and visualization. Several examples of the use of the pycroscopy ecosystem to create workflows for data ingestion and analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and scanning probe microscopy data are shown.

The primary objective of this simulation study is to mitigate recombination at the back contact and improve cell performance. It is demonstrated that incorporating Sb 2 S 3 ERL into a traditional Sb 2 Se 3 cell yields enhancements in both the short‐circuit current density (J sc ) and carrier collection rate. This enhancement is assigned to the reduced interface recombination rate at the back electrical contact. The strong electric field at the p + ‐Sb 2 S 3 /p‐Sb 2 Se 3 electrical contact creates a barrier with a height of 0.34 eV in the conduction band that hinders the electron carriers' access to the back contact. This barrier effectively improves cell efficiency. The use of this method has demonstrated a significant improvement in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) at longer wavelengths, specifically ranging from ≈800 to 1100 nm. Using this method, the Sb 2 Se 3 active layer thickness is reduced to 1 µm, which reduces the fabrication cost. After optimizing the device, the cell efficiency enhances from 9.2% to 13.1%, resulting in a significant improvement compared to traditional Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells without an ERL, thanks to the incorporation of a suitable Sb 2 S 3 ERL.",

Analysis of results predicts adsorption energies of −0.93, −1.55, −1.44, −0.98, and −1.15 eV for DDT, DMDT, FT, FNT, and RM, respectively, on C 3 N 5 monolayers. Significant charge transfers among organic pollutants and C 3 N 5 lead to distinct electronic properties of the conjugated complexes, revealed by the density of states, electrostatic potential, and work function calculations. To detect the selected pollutants in high humidity, the effects due to aqueous medium are considered. Additionally, a statistical thermodynamic analysis utilizing the Langmuir adsorption model is utilized to explore the influence of temperature and pressure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a new dual‐band terahertz absorber (DBTA) with ease of production consisting of a metallic base plane of a certain thickness, a dielectric layer on this plane, and a hexagonal metallic metasurface structure. The proposed absorber exhibits absorption band peaks above 99% at two distinct frequencies (7.51 and 8.08 THz). The absorption origin is explained as a dual‐band response using the LC resonance and dipolar response. In this way, the presented absorber facilitates production by improving absorption responses with a much simpler structure, unlike studies with complex geometries. The proposed dual‐band absorber results in sensitivity to the polarization of the incident light. Thus, it also makes the proposed structure very helpful for manipulating wave polarization and detecting waves with particular polarization. The hexagonal structure of the absorber is scaled to millimeter dimensions, and its transformation into another dual‐band absorber that can also operate in microwave frequency regions. Similarly, the hexagonal structure is transformed into a circular structure with the same geometric dimensions, and a different dual‐band absorber is obtained in the terahertz (THz) region. Moreover, the proposed concept can be extended for various applications such as bolometric sensing, thermal imaging, energy harvesting, sensing, and selective thermal emitters.",

Researchers have independently explored information propagation and opinion evolution within complex networks.

Through analyzing real‐world social hotspots on Sina Weibo, case studies and comparative analyses are conducted to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3), a member of the SMAD family, activates multiple cytokines and suggested as a therapeutic target for OA. SMAD3 variations may affect its protein structure and drug response. This study aimed to screen 195 SMAD3 variants to determine their structural consequences affecting the binding site and affinity of its known inhibitor (SIS‐3). Of these, T261I and R287W are associated with the early onset of OA causing deleterious effects. Molecular docking with SIS‐3 against native (−4.57 kcal mol −1 ) and variants shows a change in binding affinities (T261I, −5.02 kcal mol −1 , and R287W, −4.20 kcal mol −1 ). Consequently screening 3363 anti‐inflammatory compounds,N‐[[2‐(3,5‐dimethoxyphenyl)‐6‐(trifluoromethyl)pyridin‐3‐yl]methyl]‐2‐[3‐fluoro‐4‐(methanesulfonamido)phenyl]propanamide (N2P) exhibits increased affinity with native (−6.81 kcal mol −1 ), T261I (−6.91 kcal mol −1 ), and R287W (−6.90 kcal mol −1 ) along with MM/GBSA binding energy of −49.20, −50.49, and −50.46 kcal mol −1 than SIS‐3. Further, dynamics simulations reveal conformational stability of N2P with SMAD3 native and variants. The density functional theory confirms the electron transfer capability of N2P in binding with SMAD3 variants. These findings provide insights into structural consequences of SMAD3 variants, improving the understanding of its role in OA and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molluscan mucus plays vital roles in various behaviors, particularly in feeding, by capturing food particles in a net‐like structure. Recent findings underscore the role of snail saliva in particle retention by reducing particle loss following radula scraping. Given the challenges of studying snail saliva or mucus in small volumes, a numerical model using MATLAB is developed to simulate interactions between mucus, saliva, and food particles during feeding, focusing on varying viscosity, and adhesion levels. The study demonstrates that the adhesive and viscous properties of saliva are critical for particle capture, directly impacting feeding efficiency. Simulations show that higher adhesion (“stickiness”) in saliva enhances particle retention, consistent with observations that feeding efficiency depends on the physical properties of saliva. Furthermore, older viscous saliva can form boundary “belts” that direct younger, less viscous saliva with food particles toward the mouth, improving feeding efficiency by minimizing lateral diffusion. This protocol provides a flexible framework, enabling future parameter adjustments to explore how aquatic environments may select for saliva with increased shear resistance and stability, which are essential for the species' ecological adaptability. Additionally, this study presents a protocol for operating with arrays of variable lengths in numerical simulations.",

Investigating the binding selectivity of the two bromodomains BD1 and BD2 of BRD2 (BRD2‐BD1 and BRD2‐BD2) with specific inhibitors can provide valuable insights for rational design of novel therapeutic drugs. Thus, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to evaluate the selective mechanisms of three BRD2 inhibitors, Spd16, BBC0403, and SJ1461, toward BRD2‐BD1 and BRD2‐BD2. Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM‐GBSA) and Solvation Interaction Energy (SIE) methods are further employed to analyze the interaction modes and compare the binding free energies of BRD2‐BD1 and BRD2‐BD2 with these inhibitors. Although these inhibitors exert different effects on the internal structures of BRD2‐BD1 and BRD2‐BD2, their interaction patterns with these two bromodomains are similar. Phe372, Leu381, Tyr386, and Cys425 play key roles in the interaction between BRD2‐BD2 and these three inhibitors, while Pro98, Leu108, Asn156, and Ile162 are the critical residues for the binding of BRD2‐BD1 with these inhibitors. Non‐polar interactions, particularly van der Waals interactions, serve as the primary driving force behind the binding of these inhibitors with BRD2‐BD1 and BRD2‐BD2.

Recently, metal–organic framework (MOF)‐metal oxide composite materials have been explored for chemiresistive sensor applications, however their ability to detect breath compounds associated with specific diseases remains unknown. In this work, a new high‐throughput computational protocol for evaluating the sensing ability of MOF‐metal oxide toward small organic compounds is presented. This protocol uses a cluster‐based method for accelerated structure relaxation, and a combination of binding energies and density‐of‐states analysis to evaluate sensing ability, the latter measured using Wasserstein distances. This protocol is applied to the case of the MOF‐metal oxide composite material NM125‐TiO 2 and is shown to be consistent with previously reported experimental results for this system. The sensing ability of NM125‐TiO 2 for over 100 human‐breath compounds spanning 13 different diseases is examined. Statistical inference is then used to identify diseases which subsequent experimental efforts should focus on. Overall, this work provides new tools for computational sensor research, while also illustrating how computational materials science can be integrated into the field of preventative medicine.",

The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the effect of topology, in particular node connectivity, on the response of these networks. The study first defines the design space by deriving analytical expressions for geometrical dependencies and permissible parameters for each geometry Closed‐formed analytical expressions are developed subsequently to calculate the network resistance considering junction area compensation. Finally, transient coupled electro‐thermal finite element modelling (FEM) is performed across multiple topologies using automated geometry generation, meshing, analysis, and post‐processing. The analytical expressions, incorporating junction area compensation, can quickly and accurately predict the resistance of the networks. Network topology significantly impacts the resistance, demonstrating variations of up to three times over the range investigated, when compared on the same fill factor basis. Higher resistance results in a faster response time when the current density is fixed. For the same power input, however, the response time is much more similar, though spatial temperature variation remain significant. These findings provide valuable insights for designing faster, more energy‐efficient thin film heaters applicable to electronic displays, wearable technologies, energy systems, optics, photonics, and multifunctional devices.",

However, managing residential load variability during DR events is challenging, especially in smart grids with renewable energy sources like wind and photovoltaic systems.

ENN is used for precise load demand forecasting, while CLOA optimizes electricity costs by dynamically adjusting energy consumption patterns. The method is implemented in MATLAB and compared with existing approaches, including artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The ENN‐CLOA technique achieves superior cost efficiency, with a minimum electricity cost of ¥10580, outperforming ANN (¥10870), RNN (¥10780), and DNN (¥10670). The proposed method also demonstrates lower error rates in load prediction and improves peak load management. The proposed technique enhances demand response performance by reducing electricity costs, mitigating peak loads, and ensuring better energy efficiency in smart grids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates logic‐ and learning‐based wave propagation approaches for optimizing asymmetric double‐layer gold grating structures to maximize transmission and polarization performance. The logic‐based wave method (LgWM) utilizes the multiple‐layer model and transfer matrix calculations to identify optimal design parameters for specific wavelength targets, offering an efficient yet limited approach for single‐wavelength optimization. In contrast, the learning‐based wave method (LnWM) based on the explainable neural network (XNN) is developed to predict TM transmission spectra across a broad range of parameter combinations and wavelengths. By leveraging XNN frameworks, this LnWM addresses challenges of simulation domain constraints and parameter sparsity, enabling dense predictions across all design combinations. Results demonstrate that the LgWM achieves higher extinction ratios but is constrained in parameter flexibility, while the LnWM supports customizable objective functions and outperforms in multi‐wavelength optimization. Specifically, the LnWM identifies a broadband optimal design with 2.5 times higher extinction ratios across 3–5 µm wavelengths compared to the LgWM. The complementary characteristics of these wave propagation approaches provide versatile tools for optimizing asymmetric grating structures, balancing efficiency and flexibility to meet diverse design objectives.

A penetrable confinement potential is used as a model to investigate the effects of confinement on both average and orbital energies. Furthermore, this study examines how confinement influences electron probability densities inside and outside the quantum well for ground and excited state configurations. Additionally, the configuration‐average binding energy is computed at two different values of the confinement potential. The main conclusion is that the average energy and binding energy go up when the confinement radius is reduced and eventually reach at a fixed value. Other energies rise steadily until reaching their maximum values, after which they decline rapidly as the dot radius continues to decrease. For configurations , an increase in the 1s and 2s orbital energies is observed when the electron in the nl orbital begins to penetrate the quantum well.",

The M062X method, a subset of density functional theory (DFT), and the def2svp basis set are used to determine the appropriate mechanism. Three plausible mechanistic routes, labeled pathways A , B , and C , are proposed. In pathway A , triphenyl phosphite is added to the β ‐position of β ‐nitrostyrene. Pathway B involves the addition of the triphenyl phosphite molecule to the oxygen of the nitro group in β ‐nitrostyrene. In pathway C , triphenyl phosphite is added to the nitrogen of the β ‐nitrostyrene compound. Since the reaction requires the presence of two mmol of triphenyl phosphite to form the desired product, all three routes of the proposed mechanism are designed accordingly. In the gas phase, the overall energy barriers of paths A and B are 19.31 and 43.47 kcal mol −1 , respectively, while no reliable transition state is obtained for path C . For path A in different solvents, the overall energy barriers are 20.75, 20.76, and 20.76 kcal mol −1 , respectively in water, methanol, and dimethylformamide. Therefore, path A is a more favorable path, and there is not a meaningful difference between the results of the gas phase and different solvents.",

In this article, a comprehensive multiscale and multiparameter study is presented for a 3D gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) based optofluidic channel. Multiphysics simulations using finite element method (FEM), consisting of electromagnetic, thermal, and fluid flow fields are used to analyze both steady‐state spatial distribution and transient evolutions of the thermally driven fluid dynamic phenomena in the microscopic field. This study demonstrates that a nano‐scale thermal gradient can lead to nm‐scale changes in fluid dynamics and on the nano‐scale, while such convection does not significantly affect the steady‐state temperature distribution, even in the presence of injection flow, but the localized thermal‐driven convection will contribute to the flow dynamics to some extent. Given the millimetric size of the heat source in microfluidic system, convection exerts a powerful influence to control fluid motion and temperature gradient. Moreover, thanks to a comprehensive parameter study involving AuNPs temperature, channel height, and injection flow velocity, this work elucidates the role of pressure‐driven flow and thermal‐induced convection in controlling fluid and mass transport in microfluidic conditions, which will enhance the functionality of plasmofluidics for various bioapplications.",

The possibility do not import the additional error into the pre‐experimental estimation of the studied characteristics should be the goal of machine learning‐based approaches in any case limited in their accuracy by the precision and confidence of the experimental data. The representation theory and information geometry come to the fore to achieve the stated desiderates.

The methodology of regularization of the input data consistency is considered in this study in relation to the problem of the predictive modeling of the functional characteristics of family of ceramics with negative/close‐to‐zero thermal expansion (NTE or ZTE) properties. It is showed that using diffusion models as the input consistency regularization procedure allows one to achieve the reduction in predictive error for about thirty percent in its absolute value. The Hessian‐based analysis of the loss function landscape is considered as the criterion of the generalizability and model performance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, often characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation often driven by dysregulated cell cycle progression regulated by cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK4, a key regulator of the G1‐to‐S phase transition, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers. Inhibiting Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4) selectively offers a promising therapeutic strategy to induce cell cycle arrest. This study employed structure‐based pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and Molecular Mechanics ‐ Poisson Boltzmann Surface area (MM‐PBSA) analysis to identify novel CDK4 inhibitors from natural product libraries. Two lead compounds, CAP03464597 and UKR1436403, displayed exceptional binding affinity and selectivity. Detailed interaction analyses revealed strong hydrogen bonding stabilizing ligand binding within the active site and hydrophobic interactions further reinforced ligand affinity. MD simulations confirmed the conformational stability of ligand‐bound complexes, with minimal fluctuations and sustained interactions throughout 300 ns simulations. Free energy decomposition pinpointed hotspot residues contributing significantly to binding affinity. These findings underscore the potential of computer‐aided drug discovery in identifying selective CDK4 inhibitors and highlight natural products as a valuable source for anticancer therapeutics. Furthermore, the promising in silico results suggest that CAP03464597 and UKR1436403 warrant further experimental validation, including biochemical assays and cellular studies, to establish their efficacy as potential CDK4‐targeted anticancer agents.",

The material composition of nanobeam is assumed to follow a power‐law distribution along the thickness and exponential along the length. The nonuniformity in the geometry of nanobeam arises due to the linear variation of thickness along its length. The considered nanobeam is modeled as a Timoshenko nanobeam with surface layers of negligible thickness. The nonlocal and surface effects are incorporated using Eringen's nonlocal theory with Gurtin‐Murdoch's surface elasticity theory. Hamilton's energy principle is employed to derive the nonlocal equations of motion with boundary conditions. The differential quadrature method is exploited to obtain the natural frequencies and the convergence of the method is demonstrated. A parametric study is introduced to investigate the influence of critical parameters such as taper parameter, surface parameter and nonlocal parameter on the vibration characteristics of bi‐directionally graded nanobeam. This work explains that the nonuniformity in the geometry of nanobeam significantly influences the frequency range of tapered nanobeam with surface layers.

These factors contribute to widespread infection, severe health complications, and significant mortality worldwide. To understand the dynamics of the disease and control the dispersion of influenza, the existing susceptible, exposed, vaccinated, symptomatic infected, asymptomatic infected and recovered () framework is enhanced with a more complex mathematical model. This extension approach allows for the incorporation of multiple factors, including vaccination, waning immunity, and asymptomatic disease carriers. The estimation of , the basic reproduction number of the virus, is one of the outcomes vital to understanding the transmission of the virus. The virus's sensitivity to changes in control measures, such as antivirals and vaccination drives, is analyzed. The non‐standard finite difference method and Runge‐Kutta method are employed for numerical simulations. These results demonstrate a noticeable convergence and accuracy using the NSFD approach, particularly when observing different time intervals. By analyzing both disease‐free and endemic states, interventions aimed at eradicating or stabilizing the virus are assessed.

While chemically meaningful atomic charges can be obtained using a quantum chemistry method‐based charge assignment technique (density‐derived electrostatic and chemical method (DDEC6)), its application to large material datasets remains computationally demanding. As an alternative, machine‐learning (ML) models can offer the ability to determine atomic charges with high accuracy and speed. Herein, two ML models, Partial Atomic Charge Predicter for Porous Materials based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network (PACMAN) and Partial Atomic Charges in Metal‐Organic Frameworks (PACMOF), are utilized to predict atomic charges in Clean, Uniform, Refined with Automatic Tracking from Experimental Database (CURATED) covalent‐organic frameworks (COFs).

Results show PACMAN charges can more effectively reproduce DDEC6‐based charges and corresponding separation performance metrics, underscoring their suitability for high‐throughput material screening.

Although extensive experiments have been conducted on the relevant catalyst performance and reaction conditions in the practical hydrocracking process, the reaction mechanism remains unclear. Here, a first‐principles study is performed to address this long‐standing issue by taking a polycyclic aromatic naphthalene molecule as an example and choosing a typical NiMo 3 S 4 /ZSM‐5 bi‐functional catalyst for the hydrocracking reaction. By comparing the performance of various crystal planes, it is identified that the (001) plane of NiMo 3 S 4 and the (010) plane of ZSM‐5 are the most effective crystal planes for the hydrogenation and cracking processes, respectively. Based on this catalytic structure, an optimal hydrogenation pathway from naphthalene to tetralin (1 α → 4 α → 2 β → 3 β) is first revealed with the third hydrogen‐addition stage as the rate‐determining step. Then, it is disclosed that the cracking reaction occurs in the form of isomerization and energetically more favorable ring‐opening mode, and the main products are determined to include toluene, ethylbenzene, benzene, ethane, and methane. These results would deepen our understanding of the hydrocracking of naphthalene to tetralin and other products, and further promote the research of reaction mechanisms and more efficient catalysts for the utilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in heavy oil of petroleum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines significant applications across various domains, including microfluidics, biomedical engineering, and energy systems, focusing on the advancement of lab‐on‐a‐chip technologies, electrokinetic pumps, and micro‐scale filtration systems. A detailed investigation is conducted to explore the combined influence of peristaltic transport, double‐diffusive convection, electroosmosis, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), Hall current, viscous dissipation, thermal radiation, and porous medium flow in the presence of a heat source. The Poisson–Boltzmann ionic distribution is approximated using the Debye–Hückel method. The lubrication approach is adopted to make the system simpler. To solve nonlinear partial differential equations in a more sophisticated manner and to improve the reliability of models in various scientific and technical domains, this work uses the homotopy perturbation technique (HPM). A thorough investigation is conducted into the effects of key parameters on the flow characteristics using graphical representations. The results of this investigation show that, in the presence of double‐diffusive convection, the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity parameter can improve the velocity distribution of the Ree‐Eyring nanofluid. Notable variations in trapped boluses are noticed due to the influence of some influential parameters. Furthermore, the present outcomes are validated with previous discoveries under specific conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Random networks of metal oxide nanowires are of great technological interest in a variety of applications. Unveiling how the properties of the elementary components of the network, namely, nanowires and nanowire‐nanowire junctions, may emerge as macroscopic functionalities is a fundamental issue. However, the disordered nature of the network and difficulties in estimating important properties, such as the junction contact radius, hinder the understanding and exploitation of these materials. This paper develops a model suitable for discussing the electrical resistance of the network and its transition from the junction‐dominated regime to the nanowire‐dominated regime, based on the nanowire characteristic lengths and energies. The result is achieved by integrating recent network theories with the equations of semiconducting metal oxides. Constraints imposed by the thermodynamics of contact mechanics are introduced to provide a lower limit for the unknown junction contact radius. Focusing on the literature of gas sensing, the model provides a theoretical background to frame the relationship between gas‐sensing properties and the surface termination of nanowires in the context of network theories.",

The results show a significant dependence of RT on these parameters for both subband (ISB) and band‐to‐band (BTB) recombination. Specifically, radiative lifetime for ISB transitions extend to nanosecond timescales, with values reaching up to 6 ns, reflecting reduced wave function overlap and lower recombination probabilities at higher temperatures. In contrast, BTB recombination exhibits much faster dynamics in the fs range, with lifetimes as short as 10 fs, which is critical for high‐speed applications.

To address this, a novel machine learning (ML) framework utilizing decision tree‐based models and probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian network, BN) is developed.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) remains a primary therapeutic target, with donepezil as a widely used drug. However, its limited efficacy prompts the search for improved derivatives. This raises a key question: Can structural modifications to donepezil lead to analogues with improved therapeutic potential against AD? In this study, novel donepezil analogues are designed by replacing its indanone moiety with bi‐heterocyclic scaffolds to enhance binding affinity, pharmacokinetic properties, and anti‐AD activity. Molecular docking is used to identify compounds with favorable AChE interactions, followed by pharmacokinetic profiling for drug‐likeness and blood–brain barrier permeability. Molecular dynamics simulations further evaluate binding stability and free energy. Among the designed compounds, AS3 (indole‐based), AS4 (benzofuran‐based), and AS8 (coumarin‐based) showed enhanced AChE affinity and stable interactions compared to donepezil. AS4 exhibited the highest binding affinity, while AS8 demonstrated superior reactivity and chemical stability. Additionally, a new compound is designed by modifying both the indanone and piperidine moieties and introducing fluorine functionalization on the benzyl group. This compound demonstrated significantly improved binding affinity toward AChE, highlighting a promising new scaffold for further development.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) examines E. horridus setae morphology, revealing stair‐like elevations and gradual sclerotization increase from base to tip. Numerical simulations using movable cellular automata (MCA) demonstrate that optimal inclination of surface protrusions leads to vortex formation, potentially reducing friction and energy losses. Vertical protrusions cause stronger flow perturbations and higher energy dissipation compared to natural inclination. Over time, as flow self‐organizes, total power losses decrease, suggesting natural selection optimized surface structure inclination and spacing to minimize friction and energy losses. Comparisons with shark scales reveal morphological similarities but different drag reduction mechanisms, with seal louse setae utilizing a “ball‐bearing” effect and shark scales relying on a “riblet effect.” This study provides insights into surface topography's influence on fluid dynamics at small scales, with potential applications in understanding biological surfaces and designing reduced surface drag artificial surfaces.",

Its numerous potential applications in multifunctional electronic devices have sparked much research interest. However, comprehensive explanations of the high RT mobilities and transport scattering processes in the Bi 2 O 2 Te nanosheet films are still sought. Herein, measured mobility data, between 5000 and 54,074 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 2 K and 125–584 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 300 K, are examined and modeled considering several scattering sources, including ionized impurities, longitudinal optical (LO) phonon, and electron–electron interactions. The total mobility based on three scattering mechanisms provided good quantitative agreement with the experimental results from thicknesses ranging from 21.0 to 55.0 nm. Ionized impurity scattering limits mobility at temperatures lower than 50 K, but LO phonon and electron–electron scatterings dominate at temperatures between 50 and 300 K. When the thickness decreases to 21.0 nm, electron‐electron scattering strength becomes stronger and the RT mobility drops to 125 cm 2 V −1 s −1 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanofluids are employed in various heat transfer and cooling applications due to their enhanced thermal conductivity, making them valuable in electronics cooling, solar collectors, and heat exchangers. Tri‐nanofluids, which are the combination of three different nanoparticles, offer further optimization in applications such as drug delivery, enhanced oil recovery, and refrigeration systems, owing to their multifunctional and tunable properties. Therefore, the present research focuses on the magnetized convective flow of a Reiner‐Rivlin tri‐nanofluid around an extended cylinder, considering the influences of homogeneous–heterogeneous reactions, variable thermal conductivity, and entropy generation. The active nanoparticles employed in this study are silicon carbide (), silver (), and aluminum oxide (), immersed in ethylene glycol (), which serves as the base fluid. The bvp4c approach on MATALB is used to solve the dimensionless ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are obtained after the necessary transformations applied to the mathematical flow model. The effects of various parameters on fluid flow, temperature, and homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions are investigated. It is observed from the results that fluid velocity increases with higher values of the Reiner‐Rivlin fluid parameter and curvature parameter. Furthermore, as the thermal relaxation time parameter increases, the fluid temperature decreases, and also homogeneous reaction parameter leads to a notable reduction in the species concentration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The translocation of biopolymers, such as DNA and proteins, across cellular or nuclear membranes is essential for numerous biological processes. The translocation dynamics are influenced by the properties of the polymers, such as polymer stiffness, and the geometry of the capsid. This study aims to investigate the impact of polymer stiffness, activity, and different capsid geometries on the packing and ejection dynamics of both passive and active polymers. Langevin dynamics simulations are employed for a systematic investigation. It is observed that flexible polymers exhibit packing times that are faster than those of their semi‐flexible counterparts. Interestingly, for large polymers compared to the capsid size, sphere facilitates faster packing, and unpacking compared to ellipsoid, mimicking the cell nucleus and suggesting a geometrical advantage for biopolymer translocation. In summary, it is observed that increasing activity accelerates both the packing and ejection processes for both flexible and semi‐flexible polymers. However, the effect is significantly more pronounced for semi‐flexible polymers, highlighting the crucial role of polymer flexibility in these dynamics. These findings deepen the understanding of the intricate interplay between polymer flexibility, capsid geometry, and activity, providing valuable insight into the dynamics of polymer packing and ejection processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atomic trajectories from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study multi‐ion correlated transport mechanism in superionic conductors (SICs). However, it remains challenging to assess the extent of correlated migration in these materials. Here, a topology‐based method is developed to detect site‐to‐site jumps of mobile ions and analyze correlations between jumps. The host lattice of SICs is partitioned into non‐overlapping polyhedra, with mobile ions assigned to these polyhedral site regions. Such a process discretizes the MD trajectories, enabling the extraction of the sequences and timings of jumps. Through appropriate spatial and temporal criteria, correlated jumps can be identified accurately in a straightforward way. Following this, two representative SICs, and , are assembled to demonstrate its potential utility and applications. Both materials exhibit correlated transport mechanism, with the former primarily featuring two‐ion jumps and the latter involving jumps of more than two ions. This method, extendable to other SICs with rigid frameworks, can assist in designing new descriptors for ionic conductivity and accelerate the discovery of SICs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit nonradiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to the inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to nonradiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore, defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable, holds utmost importance for device applications. In this work, the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and nonradiative decay are numerically identified. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding an observable sevenfold increase in fluorescence intensity is simulated. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi‐polar effects, for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in the Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to the Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for a dielectric device environment.",

The optimum thickness of the Sb 2 (S 1‐x ,Se x ) 3 layer is 20 nm, and the ideal doping density is 10 17 cm −3 . The defect densities at the CZTSSe/Sb 2 (S 1‐x ,Se x ) 3 and CZTSSe/CdS interfaces should be controlled at 10 14 and 10 13 cm −2 or less, respectively.

This antenna is useful in the millimeter‐wave (mm‐wave), Ku‐band, and 5G mobile communications band with wearable applications in bio‐technologies. In this work, the on‐body and off‐body scenarios are studied. The off‐body flat antenna is designed for homogeneous space conditions. However, it's on body performance is studied on the surface, i.e., chest and hand. The presented design etched two vertical strips and two thin horizontal strips from ground plane, which is responsible for enhancing the isolation. The radiating elliptical patch attached to the inverted parabolic structure (mace‐like) is responsible for CP. The suggested antenna is fabricated on a Rogers 5880 (tm) substrate of height () 0.787 mm.

The increase in the complexity of the MOSFET's structure due to multiple innovations has correspondingly increased the complexity of the mathematical models used in the simulations. This results in increased computational cost, simulation time, and non‐convergence. Hence, in this work, to the best of the knowledge, for the first time, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based quantum corrected electrostatic solver is developed to simulate the Double Gate MOSFETs across cross‐section (3 to 40 nm) and gate bias (0.0 to 0.6 V). The DNN is developed to predict the spatially varying quantities that are solutions of Poisson, Schrodinger's equation, and quantum‐corrected electron concentration. The proposed DNN‐based solver has the relative mean absolute percentage error over the entire data set for electrostatic potential, and carrier concentration is 0.27% and 0.079%, respectively, at a significantly lower computational time than the traditional numerical solvers. This work opens up the possibility of performing real‐time simulations of advanced FETs, unlike the conventional simulators with much lower computational cost.",

The Caputo sense addresses the fractional time derivatives in the MD–PE and MC–HE models. The conventional collocation points switch the models to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. Newton's approach discovers the unknown coefficients of the characteristic polynomials, resulting in the novel Characteristic polynomial collocation method () solution. Despite the conventional perturbation approach, the procedure isn't contingent on certain presumptions or variable constraints. Some numerical instances serve, and their outcomes are juxtaposed visually in 2D and 3D setups.

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), offering 100% exciton utilization without the need for heavy metals. In this study, how donor and acceptor strength, as well as linkage topology, govern the photophysical behavior of a series of imidazopyridine‐based emitters using density functional theory (DFT) is explored. It is shown that strong electron donors reduce the singlet–triplet energy gap (Δ E ST ), enhance charge‐transfer (CT) character, and induce non‐negligible spin–orbit coupling (SOC)—leading to efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). In contrast, weak donors yield larger Δ E ST , higher reorganization energies, and significantly slower RISC rates. Meta‐linked isomers consistently outperform ortho and para ‐analogues in terms of RISC efficiency due to their balanced Δ E ST –SOC interplay. Cyano‐substitution on the acceptor core further tunes electronic properties by enhancing the electron‐withdrawing nature, particularly in ortho configurations. Detailed DUSHIN analyses uncover how rotational and vibrational modes modulate reorganization energies and impact triplet harvesting dynamics. Notably, weak‐donor derivatives exhibit room‐temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with phosphorescence rate constants ( k p ) ranging from 1 to 10 3 s −1 . These results provide comprehensive design guidelines for the next generation of imidazopyridine‐based TADF and RTP emitters in OLED applications.",

However, achieving high ionic conductivity at room‐temperature remains challenging due to interfacial phase effects, percolation‐threshold limitations, and processing‐induced structural defects. Moreover, the fragmentation and heterogeneity of existing literature data complicates systematic optimization, necessitating a unified database for data‐driven discovery. Here, a comprehensive and traceable database is constructed by extracting and consolidating data from peer‐reviewed literature, encompassing material compositions, processing conditions, and electrolyte performance for over 400 IPCSEs. Through Pearson correlation analysis, which quantifies a linear relationship between variables, key factors influencing ionic conductivity are identified, including filler type, content, and morphology.

Experimental results show that the ionic conductivity prediction performance of support vector regression reaches an R 2 of 0.90, demonstrating high‐quality of the dataset and the promising utility for design optimization and quantitative assessment of composition‐processing‐performance relationships.

    "abstract": "Abstract Earlier and recent findings on 2D carbon allotropes have advocated that a free standing 2D carbon form where atoms are distributed in different planes have mostly manifested themselves as semiconducting carbon allotropes. In this work, Twin Octagonal‐graphene is proposed which is a hybridized 2D semiconducting form of carbon in symmetry class where the carbon atoms are distributed in three planes. This material satisfies all stability conditions and expresses direct band gap of 1.14 eV in its band structure at the gamma point in the first Brillouin zone. The material belongs to the class of elastically soft and anisotropic category. It is observed that the material can uniquely undergo change in its electronic behavior under strain from semiconducting to metallic to semimetallic form within a range of equi‐biaxial strain without undergoing any change in its morphology. However, further increase in strain transforms the material into another stable direct semiconductor of different morphology within 10% compressive strain. The hole mobility of the original material under the acoustic–phonon approximation has been found to be ten times higher than the electron mobility of this material. The optical properties of the material for different polarization render extremely interesting features. The material has potential application in electronics, sensor, infrared detectors, night vision devices, thermophotovoltaics and optical materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The energy costs of the information services offered in data centers stand out as one of the most significant expense items. This study proposes an innovative load balance methodology that aims to reduce the energy consumption of load balancing systems serving in data centers through dynamic server management. While traditional load balancing servers have a structure that consumes energy continuously, the proposed methodology offers a system design that activates servers only when needed. This experimentally designed system consists of an administrator server and three application servers. The administrator server analyzes the instantaneous CPU utilization information from the application servers, evaluates the load trends, and activates or deactivates the servers according to the determined threshold values. At this stage, the decision to include or remove application servers from the system is made with a “rule‐based” decision system. In the study, applications are made with four different CPU utilization threshold values, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%, and the system's energy consumption is monitored. The findings show that the proposed methodology provides the highest efficiency at the highest threshold and has significant potential in terms of energy efficiency; thus, the proposed methodology can be a promising method for developing energy efficiency strategies in data centers.",

Diesel‐powered vehicles, especially in urban areas, are major sources of nitrogen and its oxides (N 2 , N 2 O, NO, and NO 2 ), which are linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To address these environmental challenges, Hydrogen‐substituted Graphdiyne (HsGDY), a next‐generation carbon‐based material, is modified through hydroxyl (─OH) functionalization to enhance gas adsorption properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to assess the structural stability and electronic properties of hydroxylated HsGDY (OH‐HsGDY) for nitrogen and its oxides adsorption. The electronic property analysis, including TDOS and PDOS, showed a reduction in energy gap (E g ) after adsorption, indicating enhanced electrical conductivity. PDOS analysis revealed orbital overlap, supporting strong adsorption. NCI‐RDG analysis confirmed the role of noncovalent interactions in gas capture. Charge density difference and Löwdin charge analysis indicated significant charge transfer during gas adsorption. Recovery time analysis showed rapid desorption, highlighting excellent reusability. Overall, these findings establish OH‐HsGDY as a promising material for the selective detection and efficient capture of nitrogen and its oxides.",

For this reason, this study proposes an improved sliding mode control method based on fractional‐order nonlinear disturbance observer (FONDOB) and extreme learning machine (ELM). First, a FONDOB is constructed to enhance the dynamic tracking ability of the mismatch disturbance by introducing fractional‐order differential operators, and a Lyapunov stability criterion is established to ensure the exponential convergence of the observation error. On this basis, a new sliding mode controller with fractional‐order sliding mode surface is designed, which is combined with the ELM algorithm to estimate the system uncertainty in order to reduce the system jitter. The numerical simulation method of the fractional‐order system is also designed in Simulink environment and simulation experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional‐order controller has better control performance than the traditional integer‐order sliding mode control.",

Tailored for X‐band applications, this BPF utilizes electromagnetic (EM) wave tunneling and strong magnetic field coupling to deliver exceptional performance. The unit cell of the BPF is composed of a square‐aperture (SA) situated between two identical layers of four‐square‐patches (FSPs), sandwiched between dielectric substrates. The experimental results reveal that the designed BPF demonstrates a transmission coefficient exceeding −3 dB within the frequency range of 9.06–11.14 GHz, achieving a relative bandwidth of 20.6%. This performance closely aligns with the predictions obtained from both the equivalent circuit model (ECM) and the finite element method (FEM) simulation, thereby validating the accuracy and effectiveness of the design approach. Additional numerical simulations have verified that the designed BPF exhibits robust performance across a broad range of incident angles, encompassing both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations.

Patients who suffer from this condition are put at risk by several surgical treatments required to replace the batteries in CIEDs. To extract the ideal feature extraction and classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from CIED records, the proposed methodology uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) along with a Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) classifier. This research work aims to solve this issue by providing a novel technique intended to improve the battery life, longevity, and energy efficiency of CIEDs. Moreover, the noise in the recorded ECG data is considerably reduced by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). A novel integrated optimization approach that combines the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) algorithm and Particle Harmonic Search (PHS) is deployed to improve constraints of the RNN‐LSTM model. The hybrid PHS‐NAG algorithm combines the generic outcomes of PHS's global search capabilities with NAG's local optimization advantages. MATLAB is used for the assessment of the formulated method's performance in improving CIED energy efficiency and extending battery life.

Only a few methods exist to measure the orthogonal in‐plane components of thermal conductivity in anisotropic films, and one that has recently been demonstrated is the pseudo steady‐state 3ω method. In this work, a computational model of pseudo steady‐state 3ω measurement chips has been developed and evaluated. Thin films of an anisotropic material are modeled with respect to the measurement of in‐plane thermal conductivity in orthogonal directions. Through modeling the measurement of an anisotropic polymer film, it is found that this method can be remarkably accurate in obtaining the orthogonal components of thermal conductivity. The measurement error, caused by heat leakage at the edge of the measurement area, can be as low as 4%. The dependence on material and measurement parameters is discussed, and it is shown that the model can also be used to correct for the heat leakage at the edge of the measurement area.",

Electronic band structure computations verify that FeCeBi is an ideal half‐metal with a semiconducting gap in the spin‐up channel and metallic behavior in the spin‐down channel, and hence, it is highly promising for spintronic devices. Elastic properties such as elastic constants (C 11 , C 12 , and C 44 ) confirmed mechanical stability based on Born–Huang criteria. Other mechanical indicators, such as the ratio B/G and Poisson's ratio, indicate a good balance of ductility and stiffness. Additionally, the electronic structure is determined to be structurally deformed sensitive; when compressed, the bandgap expands, while it reduces with dilatation. This tunability makes it easy to adapt FeCeBi to specific applications. Optical study reveals spin‐dependent effects, further confirming the compound's asymmetric half‐metallic character.

While often individual postulated GBs are considered in atomistic models, a distribution of GBs present in real ceramics should be accounted for. An often‐used method to build polycrystalline models is geometry‐based Voronoi tessellation. With it, random grain orientations generally obtain in atomistic models of GBs with non‐physically high Miller index grain surfaces. Recently, models of polycrystalline rutile TiO 2 were constructed with molecular dynamics (MD) using computational heat treatment, a procedurally nature‐like approach resulting in a distribution of GBs dominated by low‐index surfaces. It is important to understand the similarities and differences in GB‐affected properties with MD‐ and Voronoi tessellation‐based models for informed selection of an appropriate model for specific applications. Such a comparison is presented. Structural properties and the effect of grainy structures on mechanical properties and band structure are compared. High‐index surfaces prevalent in Voronoi structures lead to the formation of amorphous interlayers, and fracture stress is lower than with MD‐based structures. Band structures of GBs are analyzed in large‐scale electronic structure calculations. It is found that while low‐index surfaces do not result in trap states, high‐index surfaces and amorphous interlayers may introduce such states.",

Through variation of building blocks and, subsequently, the pore structure and chemistry, membrane performance can be tailored. This study employs nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to theoretically demonstrate the tunable selectivity of COF membranes through a bottom‐up functionalization approach. Water and salt transport are evaluated for six β‐ketoenamine‐linked COFs with varying multilayer thicknesses. For the thinnest multilayer (0.64–0.72 nm), all COFs exhibit low sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ) rejection (55–66%). However, 20 stacked sheets (6.4–7.2 nm) provide 67–98% rejection, with the sulfonated COF providing the highest Na 2 SO 4 rejection. Analysis of time‐resolved ion density profiles reveals that solute rejection is primarily governed by interfacial exclusion arising from pore size and functional group chemistry. Although increasing salt rejection compromises water permeance, the permeance of all COF membranes is at least two orders of magnitude greater than that of a commercially available nanofiltration membrane. Overall, this work guides the rational design of COF membranes for aqueous salt separation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medium‐entropy alloys (MEAs) are typically composed of three to four elements, combining the advantages of both conventional alloys and high‐entropy alloys. Different phases exhibit significant differences in structure and properties; therefore, rapidly predicting phase structures from chemical compositions can greatly accelerate the discovery of novel alloys. In this study, machine learning algorithms are effectively applied to predict the phase structures of equiatomic MEAs, enabling rapid classification into single‐phase FCC/BCC structures or amorphous structures. The dataset, based on 731 structures, is analyzed using three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Hyperparameter optimization is performed using grid search with ten‐fold cross‐validation performed on the training set. The results showed that XGBoost achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.939 on the test set. This indicates that XGBoost effectively identified key factors influencing phase stability and provides a reliable predictive tool for the rapid classification of equiatomic MEAs phases.",

Here, we illuminate that the 5f orbitals have both dual nature in superatomic bonding for protactinium, uranium, neptunium, and plutonium using density functional theory. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the partial 5f electrons are active and could be preferentially excited to 6d shells to satisfy jelliumic bonding of the 18‐electron rule (1S 2 1P 6 1D 10 ). In contrast, the extra 5f electrons are more localized for neptunium and plutonium compared with protactinium and uranium, and present antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings for the spin arrangements between actinide atoms and confined gold clusters, and largely localized at the actinide atom. This work offers not only a new recipe for breeding magnetic superatoms, but also is very promising for the designing of superconducting materials and heavy‐fermion systems.",

This DQ‐FR is excited by an asymmetric plasmonic bowtie nanoantenna array (BNA), which is based on a Au/Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 /Au trilayer. The LOF behaves in a direction in which the incident light has neither a spin‐orbit coupling nor any wave propagation. Analytical theory reveals that the LOF originates from the “hotspot” established by the DQ‐FR in the asymmetric BNA. The direction of DQ‐FR induced LOF is reversibly switched with the phase transition of Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 , which in turn pushes the achiral nanoparticle sideways in the opposite direction. A photo thermal model is used to study the temporal variation of the temperature of the Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 film to show the potential for transiting the Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 phase. Particularly, the design of hybrid nanostructure integrating a ground metal mirror can excite a strong magnetic resonance, which enhances the DQ‐FR induced LOF and reduces the Brownian motion effect on the nanoparticles. Hence, our scheme leads to a rapid and stable transportation of nanoparticles with radii as small as 10 nm.",

Proofreading and error correction generally accompany replication but also occur independently, safeguarding genetic information through all phases of the cell cycle. Advances in biochemical characterization of intracellular processes, proteomics, and the advent of single‐molecule biophysics have brought about a treasure trove of information awaiting to be assembled into an accurate mechanistic model of the DNA replication process. This review describes recent efforts to model elements of DNA replication and repair processes using computer simulations, an approach that has gained immense popularity in many areas of molecular biophysics but has yet to become mainstream in the DNA metabolism community.

However, the selectivity controlling of CO 2 reduction is still a challenging problem due to the formation of a variety of products, such as methanol, methane, formic acid, and carbon monoxide, associating with complicated reaction mechanisms. Herein, a simple and effective theoretical analysis of “reaction phases diagram” to understand the selectivity of CO 2 reduction, based on the principle of reaction free energies with sequential priority is proposed. Using this principle, the fundamental understanding of the formation of different products in CO 2 reduction is rationalized. On the basis of reaction free energies’ analysis, the selectivity trends of CO 2 reduction to methane, methanol, and ethanol from a number of experiments are discussed. At the end, the selectivity trends with a computer algorithm of searching full reaction pathways, explaining well the effects from catalyst sizes, substrate observed in experiments, are confirmed.",

The propulsion of the spermbots is simulated using a numerical model based on the method of regularized Stokeslets for computing Stokes flows in the presence of immersed obstacles. It is shown that the concentration and size of these obstacles create a pressure gradient along the propulsion axis of the spermbot; hence they influence its effective net motion.

This has aroused long‐term discussion in both theoretical and experimental fields, because this is related to whether the computationally efficient DFT can be the substitution to post‐HF. In this work, the violation to the Jacob's ladder emerges again on the boron based uranium endohedral structure U@B 40 . The proper choice of functionals has been a significant factor to predict both geometric and electronic structures of U@B 40 . Pure generalized gradient approximations (GGA) functionals give a high symmetrical singlet ground state of D 2d , while a slightly tortured C 2v triplet state is more stable when hybrid GGAs are used. Compared to pure GGAs triplet state, the spin density accumulates more obviously on its B 40 cage in hybrid GGAs triplet state. The qualitative difference originates in the proportion of exact exchange energy that can exert a tremendous influence on energy splitting between electronic states of U@B 40 . This controversial calculation is an ideal model to reestimate the role of exchange functionals in studying hZ‐EMFs. Therefore, these findings will provide important references to the benchmark experiments and future theoretical predictions.",

To rationalize the impact of chlorination versus fluorination on the electronic properties of π‐conjugated materials, quantum‐mechanical calculations have generally been carried out at the global‐hybrid becke three‐parameter Lee‐Yang‐Parr (B3LYP) level of theory. However, B3LYP suffers from drawbacks that are especially problematic in the case of π‐conjugated systems possessing a charge‐transfer character. Here, the dipole moments and energy levels of F‐ and Cl‐containing SMA fragments, that is, 1,2‐difluorobenzene and 1,2‐dichlorobenzene, are reevaluated at much more robust levels of theory. The results obtained with the (optimally tuned) long‐range corrected ωB97XD functional (coming from Head‐Gordon and coworkers and including dispersion corrections) turn out very close to those calculated with the “gold‐standard” CCSD(T) (coupled‐custer with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations) method. These results, however, both markedly differ from the B3LYP findings. This confirms that, for π‐conjugated systems, tuned long‐range corrected functionals provide a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational cost, and that much caution must be exerted when using the popular B3LYP functional.",

Thanks to the alternately and gradually changed diffusion coefficients in adjacent layers, the laminated cloak efficiently conducts the diffusive flow to shield the central region, and drastically reduces the diffusion flux in it. More importantly, the diffusion coefficients are designed following the Laplace equation instead of conventional linear transformation, hence the cloak has a very small thickness whose core/shell ratio is two magnitudes larger than traditional designs, but the diffusion flux is even one magnitude lower.

This behavior is associated with the presence of impurity phonon modes in the frequency range of 0–2 THz. The low‐frequency parts of the phonon spectra vary substantially for different divalent and trivalent RE dopants, which results in different phonon scattering events for different dopants.

In this work, a molecular dynamics simulation study is conducted to investigate water permeation through conical nanopores by considering both surface roughness and chemistry. In hydrophilic alumina nanopores, water permeability is found to increase with increasing surface roughness; however, a reverse trend is observed in hydrophobic carbon nanopores. Comprehensive microscopic analysis reveals that surface roughness in the carbon nanopores induces multiple high‐energy barriers and frequent forming/breaking of hydrogen bonding network, which impedes water permeation. In the alumina nanopores, water becomes more bulk‐like with increasing surface roughness, thus enhancing water permeation. The molecular insights from this simulation study provide quantitative understanding of water permeation in hydrophilic and hydrophobic conical nanopores and unravel the complex interplay between surface roughness and chemistry, facilitating the design of new materials for water purification.",

The electronic properties show that these materials can exhibit semiconductor to semimetal behavior depending on the phase and chemical compositions. Comparisons with other materials from the related I 2 ‐II‐IV‐VI 4 systems, which are widely explored, allow for further fundamental knowledge of chalcogenide systems to be built and for the exploration of their suitability for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Irreversible chemical reactions are responsible for limited operational lifetime of organic light‐emitting devices (OLEDs). These reactions are triggered by highly reactive polaron pairs present in the emissive layer of OLEDs. Fast recombination of the polaron pairs is, therefore, crucial for slow degradation and high stability of OLED materials. Here, a study of the formation and annihilation of close polaron pairs in binary mixtures of wide bandgap hosts and a series of blue‐phosphorescent Ir(III) complex dopants, including two novel compounds, is reported. OLED devices containing doped light‐emitting layer are fabricated, and their operational lifetimes are estimated. Although inaccessible in solid films, charge recombination kinetics inside the polaron pairs is measured in liquid solutions using nanosecond laser flash photolysis. Multiscale computer simulations are applied to connect experimental results in different media and predict recombination rates in the device, with proper account taken of the inner‐ and outersphere reorganization in nonpolar materials. Predicted rates correlate with measured operational lifetimes, which demonstrates the key role of polaron pairs in the OLED degradation process. The developed methodology is useful for the rational design of novel OLED materials with higher efficiency and stability.",

It is found that for atoms in single bonds with a large paramagnetic contribution to σ, OT‐RSH offers a significant improvement in prediction of shielding constants over popular semi‐local and hybrid density functionals, yielding non‐empirical results that are as accurate as those of semi‐empirical density functionals often used for prediction of shielding constants. This success is attributed to the improved fundamental gap prediction of the OT‐RSH approach. For atoms in multiple bonds, however, larger errors often persist. By comparing OT‐RSH and recently reported double‐hybrid functional results, the remaining difficulties are traced to significant non‐local correlation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Copper chalcogenides have attracted much attention in recent years because of their promising applications in thermoelectric conversion. However, many of them suffer from phase transformation at low temperature. Motivated by the synthesis of bulk β ‐CsCu 5 Se 3 with high phase transformation temperature of 923 K for photovoltaic applications, its thermoelectric properties using first‐principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory are systematically studied. The results show that β ‐CsCu 5 Se 3 possesses ultralow lattice thermal conductivities of 0.24, 0.41, and 0.25 W mK −1 along the x , y , and z directions at room temperature, respectively, which are further reduced to 0.09, 0.15, and 0.09 W mK −1 at 800 K. A detailed analysis of its group velocity, three phonon scattering rate, Grüneisen parameter and three phonon phase space reveals that the weak harmonicity and strong phonon anharmonic scattering are responsible for the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, leading to a high figure of merit ( ZT ) value of 1.81 along the y direction at 800 K, which is three times higher than that of known thermoelectric materials o ‐CsCu 5 S 3 (0.46 at 800 K) and t ‐CsCu 5 S 3 (0.56 at 875 K). This study suggests that β ‐CsCu 5 Se 3 is a multifunctional material promising for both photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications.",

This method uses drift velocity data of mobile charges at different lattice temperatures and applied electric fields and takes into account the effect of carrier heating. By performing time‐of‐flight measurements on single‐crystalline diamond, hole and electron drift velocities are measured under low‐injection conditions within the temperature range 10–300 K. Evaluation of the data using the proposed method identifies acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant scattering mechanism across the measured temperature range. The exception is electrons at 100–200 K where conduction‐band valley repopulation has a prominent effect. At temperatures below ≈80 K, where valley polarization is observed for electrons, transport dominated by acoustic phonon scattering is observed in different valleys separately. The scaling model is additionally tested on data from highly resistive gallium arsenide samples to demonstrate the versatility of the method. In this case, impurity scattering can be ruled out as the dominant scattering mechanism in the samples for the temperature range 80–120 K.",

One known case is that of cyclohexane physisorbed on Rh(111), in which isotope effects have been measured on the work function change and desorption energies. These effects can only be captured by calculations including nuclear quantum effects (NQE). In this paper, this interface is addressed employing dispersion‐inclusive density‐functional theory coupled to a quasi‐harmonic (QH) approximation for NQE, as well as to fully anharmonic ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). The QH approximation is able to capture that deuterated cyclohexane has a smaller adsorption energy and lies about 0.01 Å farther from the Rh(111) surface than its isotopologue, which can be correlated to the isotope effect in the work function change. An investigation of the validity of the QH approximation relying on PIMD simulations, leads to the conclusion that although this interface is highly impacted by anharmonic quantum fluctuations in the molecular layer and at bonding sites, these anharmonic contributions play a minor role when analyzing isotope effects at low temperatures. Nevertheless, anharmonic quantum fluctuations cause an increase in the distance between the molecular layer and Rh(111), a consequent smaller overall work function change, and intricate changes in orbital hybridization.",

For operation under the low light intensities that are typical for indoor application, a high shunt resistance is required calling for thick active layers in industrial processing to ensure maximum coverage. However, the thickness of an organic solar cell based on energetically disordered semiconductors is limited by space‐charge effects from charged shallow defects under nonuniform generation. While other sources of space charge such as doping and asymmetric transport have been extensively discussed in previous studies, this work offers a theoretical analysis of this photo‐induced space charge in shallow defects and visualizes how the space charge builds up with increasing light intensity with drift‐diffusion simulations. It is shown that the effect particularly deteriorates the performance of an organic solar cell with high active‐layer thickness and substantial energetic disorder. However, the simulations reveal that solar cells are less sensitive to these parameters under low light intensities due to a reduced density of photo‐induced space charge. Therefore, a wider range of material systems and absorber thicknesses can be viable for indoor applications than one may initially expect from testing under 1 sun illumination.",

An extra random variable noise is added to the system; the proposed model is suitable for the SOC at current noise factors. The convergence capability of the observer is analyzed with the linear criterion.

In this manuscript, an expression tree‐based genetic programming regression model (ETGPR) is proposed to estimate the real‐time SOC of lithium‐ion batteries. The proposed model mainly adopts the symbolic regression technique. In addition to the current–voltage curves being fed into the model, an additional approach is designed to ensure real‐time model predictions in dynamic situations, which includes the previous moment's power in the input parameters. Different seed hyperparameters in the model are set, and the model automatically performs evolutionary calculations. Subsequently, each parameter of the model is optimally adjusted to obtain a set of regression expressions that accurately reflect the relationship between the SOC and each parameter after a specified number of iterations. Finally, the generated expression is proven to perform better in terms of its ability to capture the nonlinear relationship between SOC and battery variables. Also, the model demonstrates excellent robustness in the presence of notable noise from input‐independent features compared to other models, a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.3% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 0.2% are achieved. Furthermore, the potential of the model's implement‐ability under variable temperature and real driving data conditions is verified.",

At equilibrium, the four structures in the Janus SHfAZ 2 monolayers all display indirect bandgap semiconductor properties, with the exception of the SHfGeN2 monolayer, which exhibits direct bandgap semiconductor properties. Under the influence of biaxial strain, the study observes that the electronic properties of all SHfAZ 2 monolayers can be adjusted, transitioning from semiconductor to metallic properties when subjected to compressive strain. However, the SHfSiP 2 , SHfGeP 2 , and SHfGeAs 2 monolayers show limited sensitivity to an applied electric field, with their electronic properties being modifiable solely under the influence of applied biaxial strain. In contrast, both the SHfSiAs2 and SHfGeN2 monolayers demonstrate the ability to modulate their electronic properties from semiconductors to metals when subjected to both biaxial strain and an applied electric field. Finally, the carrier mobility of these five structures is calculated.

The minimum energy pathway for the Mn diffusion is calculated, showing magnetic modifications in the substrate. A structural transition from tetragonal rock‐salt to zinc‐blende (ZB) structure as the number of MnN deposited layers increases is noticed. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the growth of MnN on CrN is feasible. The density of states for an MnN layer with an extra nitrogen layer shows a half‐metallic behavior and the remaining structures exhibit a metallic character. The ZB‐MnN structures have an antiferromagnetic behavior with a metallic character.

On the other hand, lossy mode resonance (LMR) sensors offer transducers with more alternative materials due to their flexibility, which can be excited in p‐ and s‐polarized light. In this research it is carried out a numerical investigation using the transfer matrix method on LMR sensor composed of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) as lossy layer and Cytop as matching layer. The reflectance curves for different thicknesses of MoS 2 and Cytop are numerically investigated. The results obtained show that the chip consisting of 250 nm Cytop and 4 layers of MoS 2 has a penetration depth 3 times higher than conventional SPR chips. If sensors with two types of polarization are compared, sensors with s‐polarized light have shown higher sensitivity reaching 72.13°/RIU with a wider dynamic range starting from a refractive index of 1.331 to 1.401. In this refractive index range, this sensor has displayed good signal stability where the reduction in resonance dip depth is only ≈6%. These computational results make the proposed structure very promising to be applied in the quantification of biological materials.",

The surface wave attenuation is evaluated in both waveguide and open‐space environments at high frequencies around the 28‐GHz band. Two approaches including a driven modal approach and an integrated eigenmode approach for investigating the attenuation behaviors in a metasurface waveguide operating in transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode are employed. These results show different attenuation values depending on the waveguide height due to an unavoidable coupling issue despite the same metasurface design. Thus, an alternative method for more accurately evaluating the frequency‐dependent attenuation characteristics through field distribution in open space with a customized horn antenna is proposed. A relationship between the surface wave attenuation and the propagation distance by analyzing the analytical electric field distribution at different points on the propagation path in the open space is established. Thus, this study provides an improved method for assessing surface wave attenuation characteristics, which contributes to designing surface wave control for wireless communications, wireless power transfer, signal processing, and electromagnetic compatibility.",

With the use of formal languages, the model specifications can be expressed in a rigorous and univocal way, and the model can be validated against the specifications or conceptual model. Expressing the same model in different formal languages opens the conceptual model validation to a varied number of specialists. Also, in the context of modeling a new system, where there is no data to perform validation against a real system, having pairs of models can be used to perform cross‐model verification to ensure that the model specifications or conceptual models are correctly implemented by comparing the results produced by both models. Specifically, a method is presented to translate a model conceptualized on specification and description language (SDL) to discrete event system specification (DEVS). The transformation mechanism between SDL and DEVS formalisms is described. The methodology is exemplified with a disease spread model for COVID‐19, and it is shown how the results obtained by the two models can be used for cross‐verification.",

Such a system has been previously synthetized and experimentally charachterized, showing that the incorporation of covalently bonded on bulk leads to a dramatic in‐plane lattice thermal conductivity decrease by more than two orders of magnitudes. To elucidate these experimental findings, detailed calculations of the phonon dispersion relations and scattering rates in are performed. The analysis is addressed to discern the impact of inter‐layer covalently bonded molecules on these phonon properties, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of the observed thermal conductivity decrease. Present calculations provide evidence that the observed lattice thermal conductivity reduction is attributed to two effects: the increase of inter‐layer separation and the presence of low‐frequency molecular optical modes. The first inhibits specific Van der Waals quasi‐acoustic inter‐layer vibrational modes contributing as much as in bulk . The second effect dramatically decreases the phonon group velocities as a consequence of phonon‐crossing phenomena among low‐frequency molecular modes and acoustic modes, eventually leading to a strong reduction of all phonon lifetimes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Local variations in the 3D microstructure can control the macroscopic behavior of heterogeneous porous materials. For example, the permittivity through porous sheets or membranes is governed by local high‐volume pathways or bottlenecks. Due to local variations, unfeasibly large amounts of microstructure data may be needed to reliably predict such material properties directly from image data. Here it is demonstrated that a vine copula approach provides parametric models for local microstructure descriptors that compactly capture the 3D microstructure including its local variations and efficiently probe it with respect to selected, measurable properties. In contrast to common methods of complexity reduction, the proposed approach creates parametric models for the multivariate probability distribution of high‐dimensional descriptor vectors that inherently contain the complex, nonlinear dependencies between these descriptors. Therein, material properties are offered in physically motivated distributions of microstructure descriptors rather than as normally distributed data. Applied to porous fiber networks (paper) before and after unidirectional compression, it is shown that the copula‐based models reveal material‐characteristic relationships between two or more microstructure descriptors. In this way, the presented modeling approach can provide deeper insight into the microscopic origin of effective macroscopic properties of heterogeneous porous materials.",

The hyperactivation of PI3K signaling cascades is a common occurrence in human cancers, rendering PI3K a promising therapeutic target. Although several PI3K inhibitors are already available on the market, the adverse side effects of current therapies continue to highlight the necessity for the development of novel PI3K inhibitors. In this study, a virtual screening strategy employing naïve Bayesian classification (NBC) models, based on multicomplex‐based molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling, is developed. First, the docking accuracy and scoring reliability of four docking software are assessed, and Glide demonstrated higher predictability for PI3K inhibitors. Second, pharmacophore models are generated based on the current reported PI3K‐inhibitor interactions, and five pharmacophore hypotheses displayed significant capability in discriminating active PI3K molecules from inactive ones. Subsequently, three NBC models are constructed based on molecular docking and/or pharmacophore models, and the validation results showed that the NBC model, combining multicomplex‐based molecular docking and pharmacophore, significantly improved the hit rate of virtual screening against PI3K. Finally, the optimal NBC model is employed for virtual screening against the ChEMBL database, leading to the identification of multiple molecules with high potential as active PI3K inhibitors.",

It is called structural relaxation and constitutes a local minimization problem with a non‐convex objective function whose domain complexity increases according to the number of particles involved. This work studies the performance of the two most popular gradient methods in structural relaxation, Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient. Although frequently employed, there is a lack of their study in this context from an algorithmic point of view. The algorithms are initially benchmarked on the basis of a constant step size. Three concepts for designing dynamic step size rules are then examined in detail and analyzed. Results show that there is a trade‐off between convergence rate and the possibility of an experiment to succeed. In order to address this, a function is proposed as a formal means for assigning utility to each method based on preference. The function is built according to a recently introduced model of preference indication concerning algorithms with deadline and their run time. It introduces the quantification of the optimization algorithms' performance according to convergence speed and success rate, thus enabling the appointment of a specific algorithmic recipe as the best choice for balanced preferences.",

A prominent area of research is cancer treatment through the photothermal approach. Here, numerical simulation is explored to study the impact of gold nanostructure size, shape, and laser parameters on spatiotemporal temperature patterns during photothermal therapy (PTT). Spherical, rod, star, bipyramid, and cubic nanostructures in small, medium, and large sizes underwent 150 s of laser irradiation. COMSOL software, incorporating bioheat physics, precisely gauged thermal variations. The structural characteristics notably influence the temperature profiles, with medium‐sized rod, star, and bipyramid gold nanoparticles exhibiting superior thermal properties. Experimental validation of simulations focuses on the optimal nanostructure, synthesizing through the seed growth method. Transmission electron microscopy, UV‐visible spectroscopy, and X‐ray diffraction analysis confirm its proposed characteristics. Results demonstrate a robust correlation between experimental and simulation parameters, affirming precision. Findings showcase photothermal properties in line with theoretical predictions. The aim of this study is to determine the optimal gold nanostructure for bone cancer treatment using PTT, addressing the challenges presented by the dense and resilient nature of bone tissue and deep tumor locations. By utilizing multi‐physical modeling and simulations facilitated by COMSOL software, a novel method for pre‐clinical estimation is introduced.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the study (Wang et al. 2014), an adaptive reaching law is developed for sliding mode control (SMC). However, a potential issue arises when the sliding mode surface slides at the neighborhood of the origin, causing the adaptive gain in the mentioned scheme to chatter repeatedly. This results in input command chattering and has a negative impact on the stability of the system. In order to address this problem caused by the adaptive gain and switching function in SMC, and to further improve convergence performance, a new adaptive reaching law is proposed. This proposed reaching law improves upon the previous adaptive gain and ensures stable operation as the new adaptive gain converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. This improvement prevents chattering and guarantees that the tracking error of the system converges within a finite time. Finally, comparative simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed reaching law.",

In this study, primarily simulation‐assisted analyses are conducted to explore the capacitive effect of these defects on the performance of PSCs through impedance analysis. Simulated data indicate a decrease in capacitance with increasing frequency, leading to a higher built‐in potential (ΔV bi = 150 mV). Moreover, an increase in capacitance with increasing light intensity is observed. Additionally, reducing the ionic defect concentration at the interfaces (from 10 19 to 10 16 cm −3 ) results in more significant band bending and a higher V bi . Potential solutions to mitigate interfacial ionic defects, including doping at transport layer interfaces are proposed. Doping at both interfaces introduces an energy spike (valence band offset) of 0.21 eV and a cliff (conduction band offset) of 0.16 eV, respectively, for holes and electrons, leading to an improvement in the open circuit voltage (V OC ). Finally, experimental results demonstrate a notable enhancement in V OC of 0.04 V with the introduction of Li + doping at the electron transport layer/perovskite interface. These findings provide essential perceptions for effectively mitigating the effect of interfacial ionic defects on the performance of PSCs and enhance their overall performance.",

Most of the theoretical research is based on either material or device modeling approaches.

This report combines the first‐principles density functional theory (DFT) computations and device modeling to understand the impact of structural strain, generally induced during the crystallization phase of perovskite materials, on the photovoltaic performance of methyl ammonium lead halide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 or MAPbI 3 ) based solar cell.

The impact of strain is analyzed in terms of the variations in band structure and values of optoelectronic parameters obtained using DFT calculations and further, their impact on performance metrics of solar cells is predicted using device simulations. The optimized cell efficiency under strain‐free conditions is 13% while it deteriorated to 1.6% under +2% tensile strain and improved to 22.3% under compressive strain.

The backbone network of YOLOv8n is replaced with the lightweight RepViT architecture, which is more suitable for visual tasks. This replacement simplifies the traditional structure, reduces the complexity of the backbone network, maximizes performance enhancement, and minimizes latency. Additionally, the FPN in the neck section is upgraded to Bi‐FPN, which reduces nodes and span connections and incorporates rapid normalization to achieve fast multi‐scale feature fusion. For risk grading, the algorithm infers distances and collision times, categorizing detected objects into high, medium, and low‐risk levels, and uses different colors to warn the driver. Comparative experimental results show that the optimized algorithm improves Precision by 1.7%, Recall by 2.3%, mAP@0.5 by 1.53%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 by 2.91%. In road tests, the risk warning system achieves a frame detection rate ranging from a minimum of 38.4 fps to a maximum of 59.0 fps.

The best configuration of the carbon interlayer and the required physicochemical properties of the carbon materials is identified for improved performance.

It is found that the predominant forms of these compounds at acid pH adsorb spontaneously onto the mild steel surface as the charge transfer fraction values are positive, and the aromatic rings of these forms approach the Fe (110) surface in parallel. The computed adsorption energy values exceed several hundred kcal mol −1 , thereby establishing the efficacy of the proposed dopamine derivatives as inhibitors for mild steel corrosion. To interpret the data, reduced density gradient (RDG) calculations are conducted to analyze the non‐covalent interactions (NCI) between the Fe surface and adsorbed molecules. The results of these analyses show that all proposed inhibitors interact with the surface via electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Besides, the self‐diffusivity coefficient and radial distribution function (RDF) are estimated using dynamic simulations. These calculations reveal that corrosive species ( show low diffusivity values, and therefore reduced migration in the presence of a DA2 inhibitor film, thus leading to the formation of stable protective layers, followed by DA3, while the two forms of DA1 (neutral and protonated) show the highest diffusion values.",

It streamlines the realization of ANN models characterized by diverse complexities and layer structures. The proposed method is demonstrated by developing nonlinear models for GaN HEMT on two distinct substrates. GaN‐on‐Si and GaN‐on‐SiC with respective and gate widths are characterized by S‐parameters at a grid of gate and drain bias conditions. The intrinsic gate capacitance and conductances are extracted from the de‐embedded S‐parameters, which are then integrated to find the gate charges and currents. The drain current with the inherent self‐heating and trapping effects is modeled based on the pulsed IV measurement at well‐defined quiescent voltages. Subsequently, the related ANN models of these nonlinear elements are interconnected to form the intrinsic part of the large‐signal model. This intrinsic part with all ANN sub‐models is then completely implemented using a Verilog‐A‐based code. The whole ANN large‐signal model is then validated by single‐ and two‐tone radio frequency large‐signal measurements, which shows a perfect fitting with a high convergence rate. The overall simulation time is five times reduced when the developed Verilog‐A‐based ANN is used instead of the table‐based model. Overall, the large‐signal Verilog‐A‐based ANN model exhibits an improved performance enhancement compared to the conventional table‐based models. This indicates the practical viability of the Verilog‐A integration technique in modeling the nonlinear GaN HEMTs.",

Here, a new modeling approach is presented in order to reduce the computation time of a whole VING finite element simulation. In this work, the effect of the polymer layer (Parylene C), in which nanowires are immersed, on the electromechanical behavior of the whole VING is taken into account. The active part of the VING (nanowires–polymer composite) is considered as a 1–3 piezocomposite. It is formed with ZnO piezoelectric nanowires; however, this study can be applied to any type of piezoelectric nanowires (PZT, GaN, PVDF, etc.) and matrix materials (PDMS, PMMA, Al 2 O 3 , etc.). The present method relies on the finite element method applied to a single nanowire‐composite cell in open‐circuit condition, combined with an analytical modeling of the full VING. This approach allows the computation time to be drastically reduced without inducing significant approximation errors. The expected maximum power, internal capacitance, and optimum resistance can be deduced thanks to this efficient modeling tool, offering wide perspectives for the optimization of such VING devices.",

Insufficient separation from the interface and concomitant charge pair recombination is a main limitation in improving the PCE of organic BHJ solar cells and requires an in‐depth understanding of the timescales involved. Here, a 3D kinetic Monte Carlo model of a BHJ organic solar cell is set up and the time‐dependent evolution of mutual electron–hole pair distances separating from the heterojunction interface is investigated. Large fluctuations in separation times are found, in particular in dependence of the energetic disorder and the permittivity of the organic materials. At commonly observed values of energetic disorder, slight modifications of the permittivity can drastically influence the charge separation time and even outweigh orders of magnitude of geminate recombination rates, hence help to suppress geminate recombination.

In this model, the fluid properties, the thermodynamic equilibrium of CO 2 and water steam, and an empirical CO 2 corrosion equation are systematically considered. The description by this model reasonably indicates that fast injection can decrease the corrosion risk and push the highest risk region to a deeper zone, while a longer drying time for a thicker water layer left on the well inner wall can lead to higher corrosion risk. It can also be deduced that the offshore WAG case is more aggressive than the onshore case and some mitigation strategies are suggested for reducing the corrosion risk. These should be helpful for corrosion management and leakage monitoring in the practical WAG CO 2 injection.",

The development of some fantastic properties for electrically controlling this degree of freedom encourages enormous effort to the research on magnetic systems which possess sensitive magnetic response to the electric field. Here, a giant flexomagnetoelectric effect is predicted in a typical dilute magnetic monolayer Mn‐doped MoS 2 . Combining lattice bending and magnetic doping, it is shown that the magnetic response and magnetic anisotropy can be greatly amplified under the applied electric field. Further investigations reveal that such an effect stems from the orbit‐dependent response of the single magnetic dopant. Physically, the electric field‐induced orbital polarization causes the spatial distribution change of the Mn‐3d orbital wavefunction, which is sensitive to the change of the orbital hybridization with the bent lattice. Hence the corresponding 3d energy levels can be controlled to shift near Fermi level via external electric field. These findings open a new route toward functional 2D materials design for flexible devices.",

Since the resolution of SECM imaging is directly dependent on the size of the electrode probe, the reduced surface area of nanoelectrodes allows for the imaging of smaller sample features, or more localized electrochemical reactivity. Nanoelectrodes with a radius of 130 nm are employed to image the surface of single live cells. The use of nanoscale imaging, however, introduces additional complexity into the simulation modeling of the cell surface geometry and electrochemical reactivity. The creation of tailored simulation models accounting for these specific physical conditions is utilized to overcome the additional challenges to the characterization of the electrochemical system. Methodologies for the experimental mapping and creation of 3D simulation models of single live cells have been well developed, which are presented herein. These developments include characterization of cell surface topography, tip‐to‐cell distance, as well as cell membrane permeability quantification. The advanced quantification of the complex nanoscale imaging of single live cells assisted by theoretical simulations provides increased versatility to SECM as an already powerful bioanalytical tool.",

Direct semi‐classical first‐principles‐based simulation to the case of ultra‐thin PbZrO 3 films in order to unveil the unusual electrocaloric potential of antiferroelectrics with phase competition are applied. Strong enhancement of the ECE in the vicinity of the antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transition, the coexistence of electric‐field tunable positive and negative ECE in antiferroelectrics, and a large ECE in the vicinity of lossless antipolar–polar phase transitions are predicted. Direct simulations demonstrate that phase switching, which occurs with hysteretic losses, gives rise to the irreversible heating which is explained using basic thermodynamics. A refrigeration cycle that tames the irreversible heating is proposed, tested in direct simulations, and found to outperform the conventional cycle based on fully reversible processes. Furthermore, direct simulations reveal critical misconceptions in the application of the controversial indirect approach to the case of ferroics with electric hysteresis. The route to overcoming the uncertainties with this dominant ECE investigation approach is proposed.",

Lattice mismatch between the two oxides lead to the formation of misfit dislocations, which influence vital material features. Trivalent dopant segregation to misfit dislocations at semi‐coherent oxide heterointerfaces, while not well understood, is anticipated to impact interface‐governed properties. Here, atomistic simulations elucidating the influence of misfit dislocations on dopant segregation at SrTiO 3 /MgO heterointerfaces are reported. SrO‐ and TiO 2 ‐terminated interfaces that have differing misfit dislocation structure were considered for trivalent dopants segregation. At SrO‐terminated interface, dopants tend to segregate toward but not precisely to the heterointerface, whereas at TiO 2 ‐terminated interface, dopants exhibit a thermodynamic preference to accumulate at the heterointerface. Most favorable segregation sites at SrO‐terminated interface are located within the coherent terrace, whereas those at TiO 2 ‐terminated interface are at misfit dislocation intersections. Atomic layer chemistry and the resulting misfit dislocation structure at the heterointerface, along with concomitant strain at the heterointerface due to mismatched dopants, play a critical role in influencing the observed trends for dopant segregation. Overall, the present results offer a fundamental atomic scale perspective of dopant behavior at semi‐coherent complex oxide heterointerfaces and the interplay between dopant chemistry, interface chemistry, and misfit dislocation structure.",

Following the attempted discontinuation, approximately half of the patients regress and need to return to the imatinib treatment. Interferon‐alpha monotherapy results in a cure in only a small percentage of patients. The combination of both drugs is simulated to optimize the treatment with respect to duration and schedule. This is achieved through a mathematical model in which three cell types are described: leukemic stem cells, mature leukemic cells, and CML‐cytotoxic‐lymphocyte (CML‐CTL) cells. The model is simulated in silico, under different combination treatment regimens of imatinib and interferon‐alpha. It is observed that a low level of CML‐CTL cells causes failure of the combination treatment; an intermediate level of CML‐CTL produces mixed results for the success of the combination treatment; a high level of CML‐CTL cells promotes the success of the combination treatment. According to the model, treatment can lead to low‐level persistence of CML stem cells after treatment discontinuation, even in the absence of acquired drug resistance. The model defines conditions under which imatinib‐interferon‐alpha treatment leads to CML eradication.",

The mesoscale morphology, pairwise charge transport at the donor or acceptor domains, and charge transfer reactions at the donor/acceptor interfaces are calculated. For a fundamental understanding, three prototype complexes are considered: C60@10‐cycloparaphenylene (C60@[10]CPP), C70@11‐cycloparaphenylene (C70@[11]CPP), C70@3‐cycloparaphenyleneacetylene (C70@[3]CPPA). It is found that solid state packing is crucial for the interface morphology, charge transport, and the electronic performance of the materials. While contorted and stiff packing result in small structural disorder, electron–phonon coupling is reduced, charge mobility and charge transfer is limited by the complex transport network. In contrast, a regular packing arrangement suggests an efficient charge transport; however, it is limited by the large amount of disorder and relatively large electron–phonon coupling. Hole and electron mobilities in the order of 10 −3 to 0.1 cm 2 Vs −1 and 10 −5 to 10 −2 cm 2 Vs −1 have been extracted, respectively, and electron mobilities are found to be very susceptible to intermolecular arrangements.

It is found that the incorporation of CZTS‐QDs of a single radius (1.5 nm) enhances the PCE from 9.1% to 12.34% and of 13 different radii CZTS‐QDs elevates PCE to 14.96%. This enhancement occurs mainly due to the enhancement in absorption that enhances short‐circuit current density ( J sc ) and fill factor (FF). Finally, a layer of ZnO nanowires is added on top of the glass to reduce the reflection losses and absorption of ultraviolet light in the active layer that causes degradation and reduces the stability of organic solar cells (OSCs). The hybrid structure, thus simulated, has an enhanced PCE of 16.32% and is expected to be relatively more stable.

In recent years, the 3D reference interaction site model (3DRISM), the most developed IET for solvation, has been widely applied to study protein solvation, aggregation, and drug‐receptor binding. However, hydrophobic solutes with sufficient size (&gt;nm) can induce water density depletion at the solute–solvent interface. This density depletion is not considered in the original 3DRISM theory. The authors here review the recent developments of 3DRISM at hydrophobic surfaces and related theories to address this challenge. At hydrophobic surfaces, an additional hydrophobicity‐induced density inhomogeneity equation is introduced to 3DRISM theory to consider this density depletion. Accordingly, several new closures equations including D2 closure and D2MSA closures are developed to enable stable numerical solutions of 3DRISM equations. These newly developed theories hold great promise for an accurate and rapid calculation of the solvation effect for complex molecular systems such as proteins. At the end of the report, the authors also provide a perspective on other challenges of the IETs as an efficient solvation model.",

Here, the complete substitution of Sr 2+ by Pb 2+ lone‐pair cations results in a significant loss of this ability, even though Sr 2+ and Pb 2+ have almost the same effective ionic radius. To explore the fundamental mechanism underlying this result, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on both the LaSrGa 3 O 7 ‐based and LaPbGa 3 O 7 ‐based materials, revealing a new chemical bonding effect on the incorporation of mobile oxygen interstitial defects in melilites. For LaSrGa 3 O 7 ‐based melilites, the interstitial oxygens have cooperatively weak antibonding interactions with the framework oxygen atoms (O f ). This antibonding O i ‐O f interaction pushes O i toward a 3‐linked Ga ion, enhancing the covalent bonding between this Ga ion and O i . In addition, the antibonding O i –O f interaction makes the oxygen interstitial defects and framework atoms highly active, benefiting the migration of defects. In contrast, for LaPbGa 3 O 7 ‐based materials, the 6s 2 electrons of Pb 2+ point toward the c ‐axis and form antibonding with framework O 2− . This antibonding projects into the tunnel void, thereby directly hindering the entrance of interstitial oxygen atoms into the pentagonal rings.",

The molecular origin of the fast water transport through MWCNT materials is ascribed to a synergic effect between the existence of a single water layer and low friction between water molecules and the carbon nanotube surface. Furthermore, for charged MWCNTs it is highlighted that the electrical charges on the nanotube surface result in a strong anchoring of ions and water molecules. This leads to clogging of the annular region between nanotubes and the generation of a force, which makes water transport through the central channel of the MWCNT faster.",

Predictions for ε eff are in a satisfactory agreement with the Lichtenecker and Bruggeman mixing rules, depending on whether the reaction field is ignored or incorporated into the theory. The observed differences between the Maxwell–Garnett, Lichtenecker, and Bruggeman results are interpreted in terms of the fraction of the stored dipolar energy they take into account. A novel analytical expression for the average dipolar field in the film shows a U‐shaped dependence on the filler packing fraction η, with an absolute maximum at = 1/ e . New analytical expressions derived for the average dipolar energy and dipole–dipole interaction energy in the nanocomposite depend on the cluster orientation parameter γ, and take into account the film boundary effects. It is found that the enhancement of ε eff at higher γ is associated with an increase in the inclusion dipole moment in the oriented clusters resulting from dipole–dipole correlations, which inflate the energy stored inside the inclusions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Images of molecules are widely used to predict molecule properties in teaching and chemical research. A trained chemist can easily derive molecule properties by analyzing its structure and evaluate its functional groups. To predict, for example, the water solubility of an organic compound a chemist would intuitively count the number of polar groups, consider the size of the molecule, and estimate the water/molecule interaction by counting the number of H‐bond donors and acceptors. Therefore, 2D molecule representations and their directly accessible features should provide enough information to predict the molecule's structure‐dependent properties. To support this thesis, different image‐based machine learning approaches as dense neural networks, convolutional neural networks, clustering, data augmentation, and transfer learning are compared and evaluated in this work. The influence of the image size as well as the network size is discussed. Finally, a simple yet effective dense neural network trained on expert preselected, visually accessible features, is presented and its efficiency and comparability to other more complex methods are demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Information based uncertainty measures like R{\\'e}nyi entropy (R), Shannon entropy (S) and Onicescu energy (E) (in both position and momentum space) are employed to understand the influence of radial confinement in isotropic harmonic oscillator. The transformation of Hamiltonian in to a dimensionless form gives an idea of the composite effect of oscillation frequency ($\\omega$) and confinement radius ($r_{c}$). For a given quantum state, accurate results are provided by applying respective \\emph{exact} analytical wave function in $r$ space. The $p$-space wave functions are produced from Fourier transforms of radial functions. Pilot calculations are done taking order of entropic moments ($\\alpha, \\beta$) as $(\\frac{3}{5}, 3)$ in $r$ and $p$ spaces. A detailed, systematic analysis is performed for confined harmonic oscillator (CHO) with respect to state indices $n_{r},l$, and $r_c$. It has been found that, CHO acts as a bridge between particle in a spherical box (PISB) and free isotropic harmonic oscillator (IHO). At smaller $r_c$, $E_{\\rvec}$ increases and $R_{\\rvec}^{\\alpha}, S_{\\rvec}$ decrease with rise of $n_{r}$. At moderate $r_{c}$, there exists an interaction between two competing factors: (i) radial confinement (localization) and (ii) accumulation of radial nodes with growth of $n_{r}$ (delocalization). Most of these results are reported here for the first time, revealing many new interesting features.",

The RSH‐NEGF results are also compared with alternative DFT‐NEGF combinations to highlight the importance of basing the computational study on a functional that achieves physically significant frontier orbitals.

Beyond the three prevailing structural phases of tellurene, it is further predicted 31 2D tellurium allotropes combining the particle‐swarm optimization (PSO) searches with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The corresponding dynamic and thermal stability are examined by both phonon spectrum calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Those 2D tellurium allotropes can be well categorized in terms of their intrinsic number of atomic layers, and cohesive energy. It is found that the allotropes with tri‐atomic layers are energetically most favorable, and mainly demonstrate semiconducting feature at larger cohesive energies. Four of the bi‐atomic‐layer allotropes with larger cohesive energies exhibit topological insulating feature, and two with slightly smaller cohesive energies are intrinsic superconductors with critical temperature Tc (≈8 K) competing with their bulk counterpart at high pressure. Interestingly, both topological and superconducting properties can co‐exist in one of those bi‐atomic‐layer allotropes, which is unique in the elemental 2D materials ever reported. The present study enriches the 2D tellurium allotropes and provides a viable platform for exploring novel functionalities for future device applications.",

Based on the analytical rational solutions of the governed equation, chirped first‐ and second‐order super rogue waves are engineered in the nonlinear transmission network under consideration. The effects of the dispersive elements of the network on the chirped SRWs propagating in the network system are investigated. Particularly, it is shown that the introduction of the dispersive linear capacitance of the network enhances the baseband MI and both the derived SRWs and the corresponding frequency chirp are localized in both time and space.

The similarity of absorbed PCEs on both surfaces is backbones of PCEs absorbed on the surface and the side‐chains extended to liquid phase. The difference is that side‐chains of PCEs keep a tilt angle with the C3A crystal but maintain parallel and closer to ettringite crystals. The absolute value of adsorption energy of PCEs on C3A surface is greater than that on ettringite surface, which indicate the stronger interaction between PCEs and C3A than ettringite. PCE with less side chains is favorable for the adsorption due to stronger electrostatic interaction with surface. Adsorption capacity and water‐reducing ability of PCEs are contradictory. Density of water near the solid–liquid interface is more severely decreased by PCE with more side chains. Correlation of the adsorption conformation of PCEs with the flow behaviors of fresh cement paste is summarized.",

The proposed cell can be implemented in two layers or in one, using input and output drives. According to the dimensions of the proposed model for QQCA and simulation of basic gates, designing with this cell is quite optimal; it requires five cells in the design of the AND and OR gates and two cells in the design of the NOT gate. Based on the number of cells used in the basic gates, the total area in the AND and OR gates is 576 × 10 −6 µm 2 and in the NOT gate is 276 × 10 −6 µm 2 .

Graphene nanomeshes, in particular, offer excellent platforms as filtration membranes. Molecular adsorption on pristine graphene is governed by weak van der Waals interactions, while considerable binding strengths can be achieved on defective, metal‐doped and metal‐decorated graphene. Hypothesizing that crown ether‐embedded graphene nanopores can bring in a strong electrostatic component toward molecular binding, electronic structure calculations on the binding of NH 3 , H 2 O, and HF on pristine and metal‐decorated graphene crown ethers (GCEs), latest addition to the family of graphene nanomeshes are reported. Li + and Ca 2+ decoration on crown‐4 and crown‐6 GCEs is shown to yield enhanced molecular binding strengths when compared to pristine GCEs and pristine graphene. The per molecular adsorption strengths are found to exhibit a gradual decrease upon addition of molecules. However, the propensity of the molecules to form strong hydrogen‐bonded clusters as well as exhibit favorable interactions with the GCEs contributes to a negligible decrease in the per molecular adsorption strengths in some cases. The findings indicate that metal‐decorated O‐based GCEs are potential substrates for molecular adsorption.",

Usually, the design of MA depends on the designer's professional knowledge, experience and physical inspiration. The desired optical response can be obtained by using electromagnetic simulation software to carry out hundreds or thousands of numerical calculations. Thus, it is still a challenge to quickly retrieve the optimal structure according to the desired optical response and realize the on‐demand inverse design. Besides, limited by the inner physics of the MA, it is not always possible to find the structural parameters corresponding to the desired spectrum. This paper not only takes the planar geometry and thickness of the structures into account but also realizes the probability classification of the desired spectra through the classification network.

This model is according to the normalized AlexNet Extreme Learning Machine and the Advanced Red Fox Optimization Algorithm (AlexNet‐ELM‐ARFO). The AlexNet‐ELM‐ARFO algorithm's innovation includes a formulation of an analytic relation, which doesn't attend to the established effectiveness parameter that is in the models introduced in the literature. An extended empirical dataset is utilized for defining the suggested formulation's variables. The suggested model is applied to circular columns including continuous FRP. The predictions’ validation is shown by parametric research and the precision is examined by an empirical against theoretic comparison. A supplementary comparison is demonstrated with consideration of the theoretic prediction gained from the given method and the formulations’ results using significant design codes. Outcomes prove that the used method is adapted to the FRP‐confined concrete design and ensures an improved precision in comparison with respect to the available competitors.",

The exfoliation energy of the monolayer turns out to be 37 meV Å −2 , comparable with the exfoliation energy of monolayer PdSe 2 . The HSE06 indirect bandgap of monolayer (bulk) TlPt 2 Se 3 amounts to 1.18 eV (0.63 eV). The relaxation time is calculated considering three types of scattering mechanisms. The monolayer outperforms the bulk counterpart in the Seebeck coefficient and power factor for both p ‐type and n ‐type dopings. Monolayer TlPt 2 Se 3 shows a high p ‐type Seebeck coefficient of 211 µV K −1 compared to the n ‐type Seebeck coefficient of 103 µV K −1 at maximum considered temperature (600 K) and a carrier concentration (10 20 cm −3 ). The calculated lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer TlPt 2 Se 3 is 1.92 W m −1 K −1 at 600 K which is lower than the monolayer PtSe 2 and MoSe 2 . The p ‐type figure of merit of 0.64 (at 600 K) affirms that the monolayer TlPt 2 Se 3 is an excellent thermoelectric material.",

The relative error between the calculated value of the developed grinding surface roughness model and the actual measured value is within 20%. The model and experiments show that when the grinding wheel speed is 6000 r min −1 , the workpiece speed is 70 r min −1 , and the grinding depth is 70 μm, the aspheric surface roughness increases from about Ra0.1 μm at the center of the workpiece to about Ra0.4 μm at the outer edge of the workpiece. Increasing the grinding wheel speed, reducing the grinding depth and the workpiece speed can significantly reduce the surface roughness and make the aspheric surface roughness distribution tend to be uniform.

The search for new nonlinear crystals has been extremely active due to the inherent drawbacks of existing nonlinear crystals, such as the low laser damage threshold of infrared nonlinear crystals and the phenomenon of two‐photon absorption. The stability of a material can be characterized by calculating the formation energy, and machine learning (ML) is currently the most mainstream tool to explore materials. In this paper, the digital features of nonlinear crystals are established by using only the component information. Based on the low‐variance and cross‐validated recursive feature elimination (RFECV), 11 features with strong correlation are obtained for model training. Among them, the two features related to electronegativity account for 71.44% of all features, and become the most critical factor for the formation energy predicted by the model. Three ML regression models have been proposed to predict the formation energy of nonlinear crystals. Among them, the gradient boosting regression model shows excellent prediction performance with R 2 = 0.939, RMSE = 0.205, and MAE = 0.132 eV per atom. The model provides a useful tool for fast and low‐cost prediction of nonlinear crystal formation energy.",

The analysis highlights the close relationship between charge‐spin conversion and the topological transition occurring from the low‐density, torus‐shaped Fermi surface (genus 1) to the high‐density, simply connected Fermi surfaces (genus 0). At room temperature, spin‐polarizations as large as ≈10% are obtained for input charge currents in the ≈10 2 to 10 6 Acm −2 range; at low temperature, almost full spin‐polarization can be achieved, owed to the large, impurity scattering‐limited mobilities.

Secondly, the adaptive estimations of the coefficients in the measurement equation are achieved by a linear Kalman filter algorithm, which avoids the calculation of the relationship between the open‐circuit voltage and SOC. Thirdly, an augmented state equation including the SOC, the fractional‐orders and parameters in the FOM is investigated by introducing the augmented vector method, and the state information is estimated online via the AFCKF algorithm. The algorithm requires a little computational burden while ensuring the estimation accuracy and is well adapted to complex working conditions. Besides, this study fully considers the impact of noises on the estimation effect. To better overcome the disturbances caused by unknown noises and further improve the precision and stability of the algorithm, an adaptive estimation method of the noise covariance matrices is achieved. Finally, the experimental findings are given to reveal that the proposed method can be effectively used to different working conditions and the estimation accuracy is better than the adaptive integer‐order cubature Kalman filter.",

Reinterpretation of data from the literature confirms this dependence and shows it to persist for oriented networks. Also, the number of intersections per stick at percolation, is independent of orientation for percolation perpendicular to the direction of preferential orientation; in the direction of preferential orientation, it is a linear function of an orientation parameter. For networks of sticks clustered according to a compound Poisson process, a cluster intensity, Ψ is introduced; when this is less than the percolation threshold of a random network of sticks, the percolation threshold increases linearly with cluster intensity and is independent of cluster size.

However, open questions remain about how to generate atomistic representations of amorphous surfaces that are realistic while being amenable to computational study using electronic structure methods. Here, model parameters are explored to generate accurate amorphous surface models using prototypical amorphous titanium dioxide and a melt‐quench approach. In particular, non‐standard model considerations such as minimum sample size, unit cell size, and quench conditions are varied to efficiently explore amorphous structural space. The results indicate different modeling parameters have a substantial effect on surface morphology and electronic structure that significantly alters the interpretations gained by computational study of amorphous interfaces. Critically, it is shown that the structural motifs that contribute to such differences are not detectable by short range structural analysis that has traditionally been used to assess the quality of melt‐quench derived amorphous structures.",

First, to correctly reflect the dynamic properties of LIBs, a fractional‐order system (FOS) with a constant phase component is constructed. Second, to discretize the FOS equation of LIBs, the Grünwald–Letnikov difference, Caputo derivative and Rieman–Liouville difference are employed to establish the corresponding difference equation. Third, a map function is applied to keep the order and SOC of the FOS within an appropriate interval. Further, an approach of IVC is provided for the AFOUPF to increase the accuracy of SOC estimation, taking into account that the accuracy of SOC estimation is impacted if the order of the FOS is relatively small in (0, 1). By utilizing the augmented vector approach, the simultaneous estimations of order, parameters, initial value, and SOC are resolved. Besides, an iterative approach that accommodates the noise covariance matrices is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. The AFOUPF conducts an unscented transform and resampling on each particle, resulting in a high SOC estimation accuracy in complicated situations.

Therefore, the paper proposes the YOLOv5‐ESP algorithm based on the YOLOv5 algorithm. First, the problem of poor signal quality and small data samples is addressed through data enhancement. Second, the YOLOv5‐ESP incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention‐C3 (ECA‐C3) module in the Backbone structure to enhance attention toward defect regions. The Spatial Pooling Pyramid Cross‐Stage Partial Convolution (SPPCSPC) module is introduced to extract multi‐scale features of defects. The Poly‐scale Convolution (PSConv) is applied at the end of the Neck structure to resolve the problem of imprecise localization resulting from significant differences in the scale of defect features. Soft Non‐Maximum Suppression (Soft‐NMS) is utilized in the Head structure to optimize the prediction boxes. Experimental results show that the proposed YOLOv5‐ESP achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) value of 94%, outperforming YOLOv5 and other classical algorithms. Furthermore, it maintains an average recognition time of 0.019 s per image, which meets the requirements of accuracy and real‐time performance in the industry.",

One of the methods to enhance the performance of PSCs is the optimization of the hole transport layer(HTL). In this study, COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software is employed to model and simulate PSCs, and perform coupled simulations of the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of PSCs with different HTL. The simulations analyze the carrier concentration, Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, electric field profile, and temperature distribution in the devices. The simulation results demonstrate that among the different HTL (CuO, Spiro‐OMeTAD, and NiO), NiO exhibited more favorable characteristics as a HTL for improving the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of PSCs. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency reached 17.14% with NiO as the hole transport layer, and the SRH recombination rate in PSCs based on NiO HTL of PSCs is lower than CuO and Spiro‐OMeTAD, facilitating efficient charge transport. Furthermore, the temperature distribution of PSCs is analyzed based on different HTL, and the results indicate that PSCs with NiO as the hole transport layer exhibited higher thermal stability.",

In this study, a hybrid active–passive thermal management system for a Li‐ion battery module is presented. Graphite nanopowder and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite sheets are employed to improve the low thermal conductivity of the PCM. The thermophysical properties of the nano‐enhanced PCM (NePCM) with various mass fractions are experimentally explored. A streamlined electrochemical–thermal coupled model for batteries is used to develop an air‐assisted hybrid thermal management system model. The effects of nanoparticles mass fraction, thickness of the PCM layer, and air inlet temperature on the module thermal behavior during a standard driving cycle are investigated. The hybrid system can maintain the module temperature within the safe limits and provide excellent temperature uniformity. The results reveal that an enhanced thermal conductivity is essential to recover the thermal energy storage capacity of PCM during the driving cycle. The proposed cooling approach presents a promising avenue for enhanced thermal management of Li‐ion battery modules.",

These bands have nontrivial pattern and contain regions of hyperbolic dispersion corresponding to highly anisotropic heavy fermions. Optical transitions between these bands result in the appearance of near‐threshold peaks in photoabsorption spectra.

Simulations demonstrate the formation of self‐assembled chromonic aggregates with an interlayer distance of ≈0.35 nm, with neighboring molecules showing a predominantly head‐to‐tail antiparallel stacking arrangement to minimize electrostatic repulsion between hydrophilic groups. Strong overlap of the aromatic rings occurs within the self‐assembled columns, characteristic of H‐aggregation in aqueous solution. At low concentrations, aggregates of Dye A form chiral columns, despite the presence of strictly achiral species. Chirality arises out of the minimization of steric repulsion between methoxy groups, which would otherwise disrupt the stacking of aromatic molecular cores. At higher concentrations, simulations suggest the interaction of short columns leads to the formation of an achiral‐layered structure in which hydrophobic aromatic regions of the molecule are sandwiched between two layers of hydrophilic groups. This novel lamellar structure is suggested as a likely candidate for the structure of a J‐aggregate. The latter is known to exhibit intense red‐shifted absorption peaks in solution but their structure has not yet been characterized. Self‐organization of such structures provides a route to the formation of “smectic” chromonic mesophases.",

By converting short‐lifetime singlet into long‐living triplet excitons, enhanced exciton diffusion and dissociation have been reported previously. However, only a limited increase in the OSC performance has been achieved. In this work, the interplay of the PS with both singlet and triplet excitons within organic blends is examined using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations including a comprehensive model of excitonic processes. Different morphologies of the conventional P3HT:PCBM solar cell are simulated, and the excitonic properties and their influence on the photovoltaic performance under doping are studied. The use of phosphorescent sensitization ensures high intersystem crossing and enlarges the diffusion length. An increase in the IQE of 34% is observed for a bilayer OSC. The increasing decay of triplets in proximity to the PS due to a strong spin‐orbit coupling limits the IQE. Unlike expected, triplet‐triplet annihilation does not provide a significant loss of excitons. A doped planar‐mixed molecular heterojunction outperforms an undoped bulk‐heterojunction OSC due to the enhanced exciton diffusion. A further study of optimal PS parameters predicts an increase in the IQE within bilayer solar cells by about 100%.",

In this work, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of β‐lactoglobulin (βlg) are exploited to investigate the flexibility of the individual secondary structural element of the polypeptide. The two loops and the two helices on the two sides of the molecular β‐barrel are found to be highly flexible and migrate toward the hydrophobic interior of the protein at relatively low pressures. Interestingly, there is evidence illustrating that water penetrations only occur from the loop‐side of the barrel under pressurizations, which is favored by the enlarged β‐barrel induced through the loop compression. Moreover, increased stability of βlg is attributed to the rigid regions of the protein molecule. N‐ and C‐termini of the polypeptide chain are also found to be of great importance to pressure‐induced unfolding of βlg. It is found the modeling results agree with previous experimental observations, demonstrating the validity of the applications of SMD for studies on pressure‐induced protein unfolding. Such methodology will provide new insight into HHP and be generalized for more complicated systems such as enzymes.",

Why is the proximal base round but the distal end pentagonal in adult tibiae? In this study, 3D geometrical models of the tibiae in stick insects are reconstructed aimed at investigating the buckling resistance strategy of the biological composite with different polygonal cross sections. The numerical result is consistent with the experimental observation. Based on large deflection theory, corresponding mechanical models proposed herein can accurately predict the structural response and mechanical behavior at buckling (including both Euler buckling and local buckling). Eventually, with the help of numerical and theoretical analysis, this article might have found the reason for the tibiae of stick insects naturally evolving to form the cross section with a pentagonal shape. In conclusion, the nature's choice of pentagon (S5) cross section could be a best compromise strategy to balance both Euler buckling and local buckling resistance capability.

However, a P–E loop with apparent hysteresis window can be generated from non‐ferroelectric sources such as leakage current. So far distinguishing between ferroelectric and non‐ferroelectric loops is still performed in a manual way, which can be error prone and time consuming, particularly when the loops are not easily distinguishable and the number of loops to be identified is large. Here, two machine learning (ML) approaches are developed, one using the polarization values along the P–E loops as the input dataset (termed as “value‐based” approach) and the other using the loop images as the input dataset (termed as “image‐based” approach), to identify the P–E loops as ferroelectric or non‐ferroelectric. The value‐ and image‐based ML approaches achieve identification accuracies as high as 93.08% and 87.42%, respectively. In addition, it is tested that both approaches complete an identification of about 160 loops in very short time (≈1.0 s). The high accuracy and efficiency therefore demonstrate that the ML approaches significantly outperform the manual way for distinguishing ferroelectric from non‐ferroelectric P–E loops, which may greatly facilitate the research on ferroelectrics.",

More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone. Last but not least, the declaration, for the first time in Europe, that COVID-19 epidemic ended in the two million people Slovenia may be taken as confirming the advantage of the strategy proposed in this paper.",

Here, it is shown shown that density functional theory can yield accurate band structures and time‐dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can yield accurate optical absorption spectra for these systems. This is achieved by using a screened range‐separated hybrid (SRSH) functional with a single empirical parameter, fit to reproduce the experimental band gap. By comparing TDDFT results based on the SRSH approach with those obtained based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof functional it is shown that screened long‐range exact exchange improves the accuracy of the TDDFT spectra for these systems.",

However, averaging over the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the phases can lead to incorrect estimates of the thermoelectric transport properties and the figure of merit ZT in compositions close to the percolation threshold. This is particularly true when the phases’ electronic properties are rather distinct leading to pronounced percolation effects. The authors propose an alternative model to calculate the thermoelectric properties of multi‐phased materials that are based on an expanded nodal analysis of random resistor networks (RRN). This method conserves the information about the morphology of the individual phases, allowing the study of the current paths through the phases and the influence of heterogeneous charge transport and cluster formation on the effective material properties of the composite. The authors show that in composites with strongly differing phases close to the percolation threshold the thermoelectric properties and the ZT value are always dominated exclusively by one phase or the other and never by an average of both. For these compositions, the individual samples display properties vastly different from EMT predictions and can be exploited for an increased thermoelectric performance.",

The ordering turns out to be more pronounced on calcite than dolomite due to a smaller average velocity of the n ‐alkane molecules.

The results show that functionalization is no prerequisite of structural ordering and a distinct mass density profile perpendicular to the interface.",

The uncertainties are introduced when EVs are connected to the grid, which becomes a new challenge for the load frequency control (LFC) of a power system. This paper explores the LFC of a hybrid power system (HPS) integrated with EV. The isolated HPS (IHPS) considered for this work consists of a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), a diesel engine generator (DEG), a wind turbine generator (WTG) and a solar photovoltaic generating unit. A superconducting magnetic energy storage is used to give uninterrupted power supply and to improve the dynamic stability to the system. The performance of charging and discharging of EV's battery is also analyzed. To enhance the performance of the EV, a proportional‐integral‐derivative (PID) controller is employed for controlling the pulse of the static switches. In concern with the LFC task, the PID controller is also used for WTG, CCGT, and DEG. The controller gains are tuned by the use of quasi‐oppositional whale optimization algorithm (QOWOA). The performance of IHPS model is studied under different load perturbations. A comparative dynamic response of frequency deviation profile is plotted subjected to QOWOA based PID controller.",

Yet, there lacks mechanism models to quantify the forces on the spatial distribution of the components. Here, a gradient model is explored to simulate the individual density curves of multiple types of city functional components based on the equilibria of gravitational and repulsive forces along with the urban–rural gradient. The model is concise by relying on four key variables, the attributes of components include net ecosystem service ( m ) and environmental index ( γ ); and the attributes of cities include land rent exponent ( σ ) and population attenuation coefficient ( β ). The model has been used to simulate the distribution curves of 22 types of components on the urban–rural gradients in 13 cities in two periods. The model reveals a bottom‐up mechanism that the patterns of the components in a city are determined by the economic, ecological, and social attributes of both cities and components. Strongly backed by empirical data, the model can predict the distribution curves of many types of components along with the development of cities. This model provides a general tool for analyzing the distribution of multiple objects on the gradients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the fabrication architecture employed—flat s (ubstrate) versus sharp t (ip), chemisorption versus physisorption, etc–, self assembled monolayers (SAMs) break the forward‐backward invariance even in case of homometal molecular junctions; they induce changes in electrodes' work function different from each other (). Because differences translate into internal (Volta) electric fields often exceeding those created by the highest applied biases that real junctions can withstand, one may expect effects relevant for current rectification (RR). Here, they theoretically analyze asymmetric raw I ‐ V data of benchmark junctions. Notwithstanding the large values eV, they found that the impact on rectification is completely negligible. So, the present theoretical results conveys a word of caution: not any effect that strongly breaks the inversion symmetry necessarily leads to current rectification. While their analysis indicates that per se unequal SAM‐induced 's can hardly affect RR‐values in general, it does not rule out an indirect effect for junctions where 's affect the charge transfer between the metal layer at interface and the bulk. From this perspective, using interposed narrow‐band metal adlayers may be an appealing route toward improving rectification via interface engineering.",

However, crude oil leakage image data is often difficult to obtain due to security and privacy issues in the working area. And shadow interference is also a challenge for oil leakage detection tasks. This paper proposes a crude oil leakage detection method based on the DA‐SR framework. The framework consists of two parts: the data augmentation module and shadow removal module. High‐quality synthetic oil leakage images are generated using the cycle‐consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN), and further process the synthetic images by a T‐CutMix sample processing method. To solve the problem of shadow interference, this paper uses the FlocalLoss function to calculate the confidence loss based on the YOLOv4 detection network and a hard sample retraining (HSR) algorithm to enhance the images with shadows. The experiments demonstrate that the combination of original and synthetic images when training the model can improve the performance of oil leakage detection. Finally, it is also shown that the detector built from the framework can effectively reduce the false detection of shadows.",

Here, the objective is to to explain $K$ experimental measurements by fitting to them a parameterized model of the measurement process. The model parameters are regularly determined by least-square methods, i.e., by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between the $K$ model predictions and the $K$ experimental observations, $χ^2$. The model functions often involve computationally demanding numerical simulations. Bayesian optimization methods are specifically suited for minimizing expensive model functions. However, in contrast to least-square methods such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, they only take the value of $χ^2$ into account, and neglect the $K$ individual model outputs. We present a Bayesian target-vector optimization scheme with improved performance over previous developments, that considers all $K$ contributions of the model function and that is specifically suited for parameter reconstruction problems which are often based on hundreds of observations. Its performance is compared to established methods for an optical metrology reconstruction problem and two synthetic least-squares problems. The proposed method outperforms established optimization methods. It also enables to determine accurate uncertainty estimates with very few observations of the actual model function by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on a trained surrogate model.",

Due to sensor malfunction, software inability, or human error, the gene sample value may be missing. In gene expression experiments, missing data has a massive effect on analyzing the data obtained. Consequently, this has become a crucial issue requiring an efficient imputation technique to address. This research provided a technique for predicting missing values by using clustering and top K closest neighbor techniques that consider the local similarity pattern. The K ‐means method is integrated with a spectral clustering methodology. After optimizing the clustering parameters, cluster size, and weighting criteria, missed gene sample values are estimated. The top K closest neighbor method uses weighted distance to predict the missed gene sample value falling in a specific cluster. Experimental outcomes show that the suggested imputation methodology generates efficient predictions compared to existing imputation techniques. In this research, microarray datasets comprising information from various cancers and tumors are used to experiment with the imputation performance. The primary contribution of this work is that even if the microarray dataset has varied dimensions and features, local similarity‐based approaches may be employed for missing value prediction.",

In addition, the model for engineering control is established and the stiffness characteristics are analyzed by numerical method under working conditions. The results demonstrate the nonlinear stiffness of an air spring is positively correlated with the inner pressure and compression displacement. Additionally, a finite element model is established with average relative error ratio of 0.059 and 0.074 on conditions of compression by 20 and 30 mm, respectively, satisfying engineering requirement. Moreover, the stiffness model of an air spring on any working conditions is established by fitting surfacecontaining compression displacement and inner pressure at equilibrium position then calculating its partial derivative with respect to compression displacement. The present study suggests the nonlinear stiffness prediction model of an air spring is applicable to any working conditions, only requiring inner pressure at initial and equilibrium conditions.",

These variants can be more infectious than existing strains and many of them are also more resistant to available vaccines. The appearance of these new variants cause new surges of infections, exacerbated by infrastructural difficulties, such as shortages of medical personnel or test kits. In this work, a high-resolution computational framework for modeling the simultaneous spread of two COVID-19 variants: a widely spread base variant and a new one, is established. The computational framework consists of a detailed database of a representative U.S. town and a high-resolution agent-based model that uses the Omicron variant as the base variant and offers flexibility in the incorporation of new variants. The results suggest that the spread of new variants can be contained with highly efficacious tests and mild loss of vaccine protection. However, the aggressiveness of the ongoing Omicron variant and the current waning vaccine immunity point to an endemic phase of COVID-19, in which multiple variants will coexist and residents continue to suffer from infections.",

Considering arbitrary number of input and output beams, the required amplitude and phase distributions on the metasurface plane are theoretically derived without any optimization process. How the limitation of using only passive metasurfaces poses different challenges in the practical implementation of the amplitude profile is discussed. Then, to resolve these problems, a filtering procedure is proposed which effectively produces the desired output pattern. Moreover, the design method is verified through introducing a reflective metasurface with three input beams and sixteen output beams in arbitrary directions. It utilizes a graphene‐based unit cell providing simultaneous 2/2‐bit phase/amplitude modulation, that is, totally 16 states. For validation purposes, the analytical results are compared with numerical full‐wave simulation ones in which a good agreement between them is observed. In addition, by using the proposed design method, three different practical cases for wave manipulation functionalities, including power control, beam steering, and radar cross section (RCS) reduction capabilities are demonstrated. The presented approach paves the way for efficient design of the metasurfaces for a multitude of applications, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and multifunctional surfaces.",

In this study, the feasibility of curvature engineering in manipulating the structural phase is investigated employing first‐principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and continuum mechanics analysis. With WSe 2 and MoTe 2 as TMD representatives, it is found that bending deformation can not only energetically induce 2H → T (1T, 1T′, or 1T″) phase transformation, but also kinetically facilitate the phase transition by lowering transition activation barriers. Moreover, a phase stability diagram is constructed which suggests ways of achieving both uniformly 2H → T phase transition and programming printing of T phases in 2H‐TMD membranes. The theoretical results not only suggest a new feasible experimental design strategy of phase engineering, but also sheds light on novel device design with the patterning of T phases on the 2H‐TMD membrane.",

Here, we studied h‐BN monolayer with GBs on Ni(111) and Cu(111) surfaces through a comprehensively first‐principles calculation. Our results show that for the free‐standing h‐BN monolayer with GBs, it presents a moiré pattern characteristic and its energy gap is narrowed by about 38%. When h‐BN with GBs is deposited on Ni(111) and Cu(111) surfaces, the GBs containing B‐B pairs are attracted to the TM surface while the GBs with N‐N pairs(GBs‐N) parts are repelled from the surfaces. Interestingly, the calculated Schottky barriers (SBs) for electrons between the h‐BN layer and the TM surfaces almost disappear due to the existence of GB structures. Thus, our results predicted that h‐BN with GBs may form ohmic contact with TM surfaces, which can be used in real electric devices.",

Here, the nuclear‐weighted X‐ray maximum entropy method (NXMEM) is used to study disorder and ion migration in both the β‐ and the α‐phase based on the analysis of single crystal X‐ray diffraction data. The NXMEM density calculated at different temperatures very convincingly shows an unbiased view of ion migration from copper‐rich to copper‐deficient layers eventually leading to the equal distribution in the cubic high temperature phase. This directly confirms that copper mobility and disordering is the driving force behind the peculiar phase transition. In the super‐ionic phase, no density is observed in the octahedral holes even though it is the point of lowest density in the Se anion procrystal. Thus, Cu ions neither occupy this site at equilibrium nor use this site for migration. The NXMEM density suggests an ion migration pathway between 32f sites skirting around the octahedral cavity. In Cu 2 Se, the strong cation–cation repulsion leads to cooperative effects with highly complex equilibrium disorder and ion migration paths.",

Bio‐inspired robotic micro‐swimmers require fast and reliable numerical models for robust control in order to carry out demanding therapeutic tasks as envisaged for more than 60 years. The fastest known numerical model, the resistive force theory (RFT), incorporates local viscous force coefficients with the local velocity of slender bodies in order to find the resisting hydrodynamic forces, however, omitting the induced far‐field. As a result, the power requirement cannot be predicted accurately. The question of predicting and supplying the necessary power is one of the obstacles impeding the micro‐robotic efforts. In this study, a novel strategy is proposed to improve the RFT‐based analysis, particularly for spermatozoa and spermatozoa‐inspired micro‐swimmers with elastic slender tails, in order to present a practical solution to the problem. The postulated analytical improvement and the associated correction coefficients are based on hydrodynamic impedance analysis of the time‐dependent solution of three‐dimensional (3D) Navier–Stokes equations incorporated with deforming mesh and subject to conservation of mass.",

Here, a data‐driven accelerated (DA2) sampling method is proposed, which is capable of searching new functional states of protein from a known structure with high efficiency. The key function of DA2 sampling is to drive the conformational change of protein along its intrinsic motion without introducing biased potential/force, where principle component analysis is applied on‐the‐fly to reduce the highly redundant information generated by molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, the capacity and accuracy of DA2 sampling are validated by using alanine dipeptide. This protocol is then applied to search for the closed state of N‐terminal calmodulin (nCaM) from the open one. The identified structure resembles the crystal structure of nCaM in its closed state, with a root‐mean‐square deviation between the two of only 1.8 Å. Interestingly, independent DA2 samplings disclose different open‐to‐closed transition pathways for nCaM, which is likely to have implications for its biological functions. Therefore, DA2 sampling is expected to play important roles in exploring functional states of a broad spectrum of proteins at atomic level that are not easily determined experimentally.",

However, the preparation of such materials is still a trial‐error based approach due to the lack of detailed glass structure understanding. In this work, the authors study the phase separation and potential nanocrystal formation in a series of Ba 2+ and La 3+ containing fluoroaluminosilicate glasses by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Fluoride phase separation is observed from all simulated glass samples. With gradual LaF 3 to BaF 2 substitution, the cations enrichment changes from Ba 2+ , to Ba 2+ and La 3+ , and finally La 3+ in the fluoride‐rich regions. Besides, the competition between Al 3+ and La 3+ in fluoride phase and the consequently redistribution of Al 3+ and Na + into oxide phase are observed, which can change the local environment of luminescent centers, affecting luminescence. An experimental support to this phenomenon is given. Therefore, MD simulation with effective potentials can be a practical method to study the structural origins of nanocrystal from fluoride phase separation as well as to study the structure‐property relationship in fluoroaluminosilicate glass. The simulation driven glass structure and crystal phase exploration can thus become an effective method in designing glass‐ceramics for luminescence and other applications.",

It is shown that the parallel exfoliation of graphene requires far less external forces as compared with the perpendicular exfoliation. Among different mediums, the 1:2 molar ratio of urea to glycerol solution presents the smallest or even negligible resistive force in both directions due to the less compressed steric hindrance to graphene exfoliation and the optimal hydrogen bonds formed between the binary solvents. During the dispersion process, the urea molecules first wedge into the graphene interlayer and then facilitate the glycerol to diffuse around or inside of the interstice due to hydrogen bonding. The confined solvents form stable layered structure to solvate and stabilize the exfoliated graphene.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of such fibers on foundations are performed, and crucial material parameters, such as the stiffness of the particle matrix and Young's modulus of the fibers are evaluated. Subsequently, a micro‐mechanical constitutive model is formulated, wherein fiber‐reinforced composites are characterized by a homogeneous distribution and an isotropic orientation of fibers. The fibers are modeled as beams undergoing bending and stretching while resting on Winkler‐type of elastic foundations. The 3D macroscopic network behavior is finally presented. As an example, the particle matrix used is a silica aerogel and the fibers are modeled as double‐walled carbon nanotubes.

All this stems from density functional theory (DFT)‐based quantum mechanics‐molecular mechanics and broken symmetry (BS) calculations that are extended to X‐ray‐diffraction‐caught oxodiferric and I‐type peroxodiferric systems from other subunits of the same crystal structure, validating them while determining antiferromagnetic coupling with all such diiron systems except the oxodiferric one. The latter converged, on BS, to ferromagnetic coupling under a wide variety of hybrid DFT functionals and basis sets.

Here, a combination of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of exciton dynamics with a genetic algorithm to automatically optimize the external quantum efficiency of donor–acceptor interfaces under different scenarios is employed. Simulations include phenomena from light absorption to exciton diffusion, dissociation, radiative recombination, and internal conversion, thus modeling the main physical processes that define the overall efficiency of an OPV up to charge separation. It is shown that when internal conversion is kept in check, the combination of optimal transition dipole moments and absorption energies points at low bandgap polymers as the most promising candidates for donor materials. However, when non-radiative deexcitation mechanisms are stronger, the optimization strategy shifts toward higher bandgaps, focusing rather on increasing the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor. Finally, the approach shows that adjusting the energy levels of the acceptor so that exciton transfers across the interface become negligible produces important gains in efficiency and at the same time reduces the system's dependence on large electronic couplings.

However, the existing single‐sensor‐based multispectral cameras require accurate alignment to overlay each filter on image sensor pixels, which makes their fabrication very complex, especially when the number of bands is large. This paper demonstrates a new filter technology using a hybrid combination of single plasmonic layer and dielectric layers by computational simulations. A filter mosaic of various bands with narrow spectral width can be achieved with single run manufacturing processes (i.e., exposure, development, deposition, and other minor steps) regardless of the number of bands.",

However, non‐autonomous physical systems or non‐autonomous simulation processes are becoming more and more important. A representation of non‐autonomous Markov jump processes is presented as autonomous Markov chains on space‐time. Augmenting the spatial information of the embedded Markov chain by the temporal information of the associated jump times, the so‐called augmented jump chain is derived. The augmented jump chain inherits the sparseness of the infinitesimal generator of the original process and therefore provides a useful tool for studying time‐dependent dynamics even in high dimensions. Furthermore, possible generalizations and applications to the computation of committor functions and coherent sets in the non‐autonomous setting are discussed. After deriving the theoretical foundations, the concepts with a proof‐of‐concept Galerkin discretization of the transfer operator of the augmented jump chain applied to simple examples are illustrated.",

Here, the structural and electronic properties of WCrC monolayer and its nanoribbons, and the effects of add‐atom adsorption in combination with strain engineering are presented by using first‐principles calculation. The result reveals that pristine WCrC monolayer is always dynamically stable and exhibits metallicity. Within a certain coverage range, the metallic WCrC monolayer can be transformed into semi‐metallic WCrCO 2 with dual narrow band gap by adsorbing O atoms, but adsorbed H and Cl atoms cannot change its metal behavior. Moreover, the spin‐splitting of WCrC monolayer is obvious, but when the compressive strain increases to 8%, the energy bands of WCrC monolayer achieve a singular behavior of spin degeneracy. However, neither compressive strain nor tensile strain changes the metallicity of WCrC monolayer. Meanwhile, WCrC nanoribbons with diverse boundaries configurations and edge‐terminated atoms are all metallic, which indicates that boundary configurations and edge‐terminated atoms are not the key factors affecting the metallicity of WCrC nanoribbons. These results suggest that WCrC derivatives are mainly metallic materials, which are expected to be applied in the field of spintronics and may provide new opportunities for the development of metal ion battery electrodes.",

The magnetization process is treated as a result of a joint contribution of an assembly of single‐domain particles each of which dwells inside its own elastomer cavity. Magnetization of such a particle is a complex magnetomechanical process that combines intrinsic magnetization reversal and particle mechanical rotation. Possible slippage of the particles, in the course of which they disconnect from the matrix and, on their move, rub against the cavity wall, is explicitly taken into account. The influence of the slippage effect on the macroscopic magnetization of the composite is analyzed by means of computer simulation. Occurrence of asymmetrical magnetization loops of single‐domain particles located in an elastic medium is demonstrated. It is shown that by allowing for the slippage, it becomes possible to explain the experimentally observed anomalously low but non‐zero half‐width (coercivity) of the hysteresis loops of the MAE samples.",

These results provide an enhanced understanding of the effect of the NFAs core structure (electron rich/poor group) on the photophysical and optoelectronic properties. In addition, the effect of the small ΔLUMO value (the subtle difference in energy between LUMO+1 and LUMO orbitals of NFAs; LUMO=lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) on ultrafast charge transfer and charge separation processes in OPVs, recently identified as a key factor for all top rated high performing NFAs, is studied. So far, ΔLUMO‐based theoretical studies are limited to individual NFAs; here, for the first time, the authors have extended to the respective donor/acceptor complexes as well. Finally, based on the first‐principles density functional theory calculations with the seven reported NFAs, , P3HT, and the seven newly modeled donor–acceptor complexes, this study sheds light on important factors that will provide trends and guidelines for further rational design of more efficient NF‐acceptors for OPVs.",

Other than the choice of piezoelectric material, the substrate layer material also plays an important role to increase the energy harvesting in PEH. Earlier researches have emphasized on selecting a few substrate materials than all available in literature. However, we argue that the choice of the substrate material and its mechanical properties depend on the design of the PEH. We establish this fact by designing 20 different PEH models by varying the size of cantilever, substrate layer thickness, and types of the piezoelectric materials. These models are simulated in COMSOL with every known substrate material to select the best substrate material. We also propose a greedy approach to further increase the energy harvesting by optimizing the mechanical properties of the best substrate material. In all models, the best substrate material harvests at least 2 × more energy. The greedy approach increases energy harvesting in almost 50% of the models. Some of the substrate materials with optimized mechanical properties are reported in literature, however, this research opens up a discussion to manufacture new substrate materials to increase energy harvesting in PEH.",

For regular macro‐arrays, the problem is formulated and solved numerically by using cell models. The use of rigorous cell models requires 3D numerical simulations, but a simplified (cylindrical, 2D) cell model is shown to have an excellent accuracy. Numerical as well as theoretical analyses reveal a simple far‐field behavior described by an asymptotic expression for an additional potential drop (applicable for sources whose size does not exceed about 40% of the intersource distance) dependent on just one numerical constant. This expression is used for the derivation of useful approximate formulae for several applications (diffusion resistance of composite membranes, limiting current in arrays of microelectrodes, entrance diffusion resistance in arrays of scarce and short nanopores) and compared with relevant interpolation formulae available in the literature.",

Many variables with interactions between themselves are involved in modifying these properties. This study aims to provide an accurate and effective method for predicting the magnetic properties of M‐type ferrites under the influence of involved variables. For this purpose, ferrites are synthesized by doping 17 different ions and the results of the analysis of samples form the experimental data. The support vector regression (SVR) model is selected for prediction and in order to optimize hyper parameters, genetic, particle swarm optimization, and sequential minimal optimization techniques are used. Based on the comparison between the outcomes of these algorithms, the model with the best performance is used to predict coercivity and residual magnetism in M‐type magnetic ferrites. Furthermore, with the cross validation technique, the accuracy and robustness of the model designed for new samples are evaluated. The results show that the selected SVR model, with an average absolute relative error of 2% and 0.7%, is able to predict coercivity and residual magnetism, respectively. Consequently, the prediction method presented has the capability to accelerate and develop the modification of magnetic properties for different applications.",

Without an appropriate theoretical guide, relying on expensive experimental approaches to enhance the sensitivity will significantly limit the advancement of this technology. This article proposes an efficient analytical model, with some parameters determined from experiments, to investigate the piezoresistive behaviors of microporous nanocomposites. The predicted results agree well with the analysis from finite element models as well as the experimental data. Moreover, scaling law is applied to study the effect of geometry, material, and interface on the sensitivity of the sensor.

The use of multi‐valued QCA is of interest because of its proximity to fuzzy logic, and lower power consumption. A two‐layer quinary system is proposed and the basic logic gates are examined and simulated to confirm the correct performance of the proposed cell. The proposed cell employs two layers because the presence of more than two particles per layer destabilizes the design of logic gates. The proposed Quinary QCA(QuQCA) cell can be implemented in one layer using input and output derives. Simple relationships are proposed to calculate the polarization values and the number and type of layers, so complex quantum computations can be avoided. The quantum power consumption and the proposed cell power consumption of the quinary system are calculated and compared. Finally, we present n ‐valued cells without using quantum computation, and these cells are examined in terms of the number of particles, polarization value, and cell structure. The n ‐level cell can be investigated more easily than other technologies due to its proximity to fuzzy logic and the design of the input, output, and fuzzy membership function.",

Due to the chemical interaction between electrodes and intermediates produced in charging and discharging process, the Janus‐polar two dimensional (2D) electrode materials can enhance the electrochemical performance of Li–S battery by overcoming shuttle effect and increasing diffusion rates. Here, it is explored the structural, electronic, and dynamic characteristics of Li ion, S 8 cluster, and lithium polysulfides adsorbed over Janus Phosphorus Nitride monolayer with blue phosphorene phase (b‐PN) by using first‐principles calculations. The reported findings highlight potential of the b‐PN monolayer as a good host material, given that the large absorption energies of different clusters vary from −0.47 to −3.78 eV, which can suppress shuttle effect effectively. These strong adsorptions are origin from the chemical interaction between nitrogen atoms of the b‐PN and Li atoms in lithium polysulfides in present work. Particularly, it is predicted that b‐PN monolayer has extremely small diffusion barriers for Li ion and Li 2 S 8 clusters of 0.10 and 0.03 eV, which leading to a higher battery charge and discharge rate than reported graphene and MoS 2 . It is hoped that this efficient strategy for promising host materials of sulfur‐electrode guides the development of next‐generation lithium–sulfur batteries.",

Via density functional theory, we conclude that although thermodynamically possible, 2‐PyH −* formation on CdTe(111) or CuInS 2 (112) is hindered kinetically. A different CO 2 reduction pathway, distinct from GaP's mechanism, must be operative. We predict that surface hydride (H −* ) readily forms on CdTe(111) and CuInS 2 (112) and direct surface hydride transfer (HT) to CO 2 dominates over transfer to adsorbed pyridine (Py * ). Direct HT to CO 2 has a large thermodynamic driving force and zero activation barrier on both surfaces. This reaction becomes slightly more spontaneous with adjacent Py * on both surfaces, rationalizing experiments where Py slightly enhances CO 2 reduction on CdTe and CuInS 2 . We thus conclude, Py is largely a spectator in CO 2 reduction on these electrodes, unlike its key role as hydride shuttle on GaP. HT from H −* to CO 2 also competes effectively with hydrogen evolution on these two surfaces, explaining the observed selectivity for CO 2 reduction over hydrogen evolution. Finally, formic acid readily adsorbs on CuInS 2 (112), which may facilitate the observed methanol formation.",

In this work, a strategy to design four‐channel metasurface based on a novel single‐cell quad‐band meta‐atom is proposed for the kaleidoscopic wavefront manipulations. While illuminating a circularly polarized wave, the independent 2π phase shifts at four distinct frequencies can be obtained by the single‐layered substrate meta‐atom with almost theoretically maximal transmission amplitudes. As a proof‐of‐concept demonstration, a four‐channel metasurface is designed to realize a single‐vortex beam generator, a dual‐vortex beam generator, a meta‐hologram, and a focusing metalens in channels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The experiment and full‐wave simulation results agree very well with each other, validating the design concept. The proposed strategy has increased the number of operation frequencies for a single‐cell meta‐atom while guaranteeing the electromagnetic performance, and may lead to advances in a variety of multifunctional devices with a compact structure such as ultra‐thin metalenses, beam generators, and holographic displays.",

Some of the roots of the symbolic quintic equation for this case have their isolation intervals determined and, as this cannot be done for all roots with the help of quadratic equations only, finite intervals containing 1 or 3 roots, or 0 or 2 roots, or, rarely, 0, or 2, or 4 roots of the quintic are identified. Knowledge of the stationary points of the quintic lifts this indeterminacy and allows finding the isolation interval of each root. Separately, using the complete root classification of the quintic, one can also lift this indeterminacy.

Constraints describing viscoelastic joints in the system and the phenomenon of the melt‐electrospun fiber adhering to the collector plate are implemented using the Udwadia Kalaba method. Rotational viscoelastic elements are introduced to mimic the dampening of the whipping motion observed in the unstable region.

Herein, by first‐principles calculation, an efficient p‐type doping on the c‐BN surface (areal hole density of 8.82 × 10 13 cm −2 and hole mobility of 826 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature) is realized by the surface charge transfer mechanism with the MoO 3 molecule having a high electron affinity as the dopant. The MoO 3 molecule draws electrons from the c‐BN, making the hole accumulation on the c‐BN surface. The areal hole density of c‐BN enhances with the increase of MoO 3 molecule density and reaches the maximum (1.24 × 10 14 cm −2 ) with MoO 3 monolayer adsorption. The optical absorption coefficient significantly increases in the infrared and visible regions. The superior p‐type doping for c‐BN is also achieved by adsorbing transistor metal oxides with the high electron affinity values (such as ReO 3 , CrO 3 , WO 3 , and V 2 O 5 ).

The study of a fluorophore in the presence of the nano core–shell topology is performed, by employing the following models: the hard‐wall hydrodynamic model and the generalized nonlocal optical response. The analysis is conducted by investigating the fluorescence rates of the system, while considering the fluorophore located inside and outside the nanoparticle. It is demonstrated that the rates generated by the above models may considerably differ from the ones obtained via the classical approach. The optimal fluorescence enhancements for different size and material parameters are found both inside and outside the studied topology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a significant role in enhancing the stability and durability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) by separating highly reactive lithium metal anode (LMA) from the electrolyte to avoid continuous degradation. However, the underlying reaction mechanism is still far from clear. Herein, a hybrid ab initio and reactive force field (HAIR) method is employed to extend the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to 1 ns, which provides crystal information about the reaction mechanism of elementary reactions that can explain the components and morphology evolution of SEI formation. Specifically, HAIR simulation confirms the two‐electron (2 e – ) reduction of ethylene carbonate (EC) by releasing CO and CO 2 , agreeing with phenomenal experiment observation. As the unsaturated intermediates accumulate, polymerization reactions occur, producing linear polyethylene oxide (PEO), Li 2 OCO 2 CH 2 CH 2 , Li 2 OCO 2 (CH 2 ) 4 , etc., which regulate the formation of outer organic layer (OOL) that consists of linear polyethylene oxide (PEO), Li 2 OCO 2 CH 2 CH 2 , Li 2 OCO 2 (CH 2 ) 4 , etc., and the inner inorganic layer (IIL) mainly consists of LiF and Li 2 O. Simulations at low concentration (LC, 1M) and high concentration (HC, 5M) reveal significantly different reaction pathways when HC electrolyte can significantly promote the formation of homogenous LiF that has been regarded as an important component to facilitate robust SEI.",

In this context, appropriately describing molecules and efficiently extracting patterns from electronic‐structure calculations are the core challenges for the success of the quantum‐mechanics‐based ML approaches. Here, MolNet‐3D is introduced, a strong deep learning architecture capable of mapping from a flexible and universal 3D topography descriptor to quantum‐mechanical observables of molecules of arbitrary shape. The model can learn an invariant representation without the need for the transformation of atom coordinates into interatomic distances, thus preserving the intrinsic 3D topography information of molecules. The capabilities of MolNet‐3D are shown by accurately predicting the various density functional theory calculated properties for molecules, including energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties. Compared with the previously proposed ML methods in the MoleculeNet benchmarks, our model generally offers the best performance in those quantum‐mechanical tasks, elucidating the importance of intrinsic topography information in molecular representation learning. This work may provide new insight into the construction of molecular ML models from 3D topography recognition perspectives.",

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting an unsteady crystal growth process, but its wider application is hindered by the large amount of training data required for sufficient accuracy. To address this problem, this study investigates the capability of transfer learning to predict geometric evolution in an unsteady silicon carbide (SiC) solution growth system based on a small amount of data. The performance of transferred models is discussed regarding the effect of the transfer learning method, training data amount, and time step length. The transfer learning strategy yields the same accuracy as that of training from scratch but requires only 20% of the training data. The accuracy is stably inherited through successive time steps, which demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in reducing the required amount of training data for predicting evolution in an unsteady crystal growth process. Moreover, the transferred models trained with relatively more data (no more than 100%) further improve the accuracy inherited from the source model through multiple time steps, which broadens the application scope of transfer learning.",

However, the theoretical characterization of quantitative relationship between breakdown strength and temperature has been a challenge. Herein, a theory termed energy storage capacity has been developed to generate and understand the nature of this quantitative relationship. This theory defines a limit value of stored energy associated with the material breakdown, including electric energy and the equivalent heat energy. Then, a parameter‐free theoretical model of temperature‐dependent breakdown strength of materials is developed, which takes into account the effects of dielectric constant and melting point. This non‐fitting model, without the need to carry out any destructive experiments and data fitting, is validated with excellent agreement between the predicted and measured values of both polymers and ceramics, monolithic and multilayered polymer/ceramic composites. It is shown that the failure of large classes of substances, including ceramics and polymers under heat and electrical force or mechanical force can be accurately modeled using the concept of the temperature independent limit value of the stored energy. This should become the new insight and entry point for the development of quantitative characterization of temperature‐dependent physical and mechanical properties of materials.",

A computational investigation of these derivatives clarifies that introduction of electron‐withdrawing nitrogen atoms improves the intrinsic redox potential at fully charged states, exhibiting a linear correlation between redox potential and electron affinity. However, this linear relationship between the redox potential and the density of nitrogen dopants is not fully followed during the discharging process. Consequently, it is found that doping one to three nitrogen atoms into anthracene is detrimental to the Li‐storage capacity, while doping four to ten nitrogen atoms is suggested as a suitable approach to improve the redox properties. At the end of the discharging process, electron affinity no longer plays a critical role in determining the redox potential. Each derivative is cathodically deactivated with the binding of the last Li atom, primarily owing to a sudden increase in the solvation energy, despite a negligible change in the electron affinity. These analyses assist to establish a promising approach for designing nitrogen‐incorporated anthracene derivatives for high‐performance cathode applications.",

For two typical sequences, bending persistence length, stretch, and twist modulus are analyzed and compared in detail. These results demonstrate that dsDNA has a smaller bending persistence length value than dsRNA, however, the former has about 2.6 times stretch modulus than the latter one and the twist modulus in the former is smaller than the latter. Furthermore, the microstructural parameter analysis indicates that the inclination angle of a single base pair and the dihedral angle between two bases in a base pair, as well as the slide between adjacent base pairs, influences the structural elasticities of these two types of nucleic acids. Results also show that the dsDNA has a positive stretch‐twist coupling parameter while the dsRNA has a negative stretch‐twist coupling parameter.

The interaction between both systems is exothermic showing binding energies below −4 eV. In spite of the large interaction, the structure of the (TiO 2 ) 84 nanoparticle remains unaltered. However, the metal‐support interaction promotes the deformation of the Ru 13 cluster atomic structure. This deformation is more accentuated when the Ru 13 nanocluster is situated in the facet region of the (TiO 2 ) 84 nanoparticle than when the interaction involves the edge regions. The formation of the Ru 13 /(TiO 2 ) 84 heterostructure leads to a decrease of the energy gap inherent to the bare (TiO 2 ) 84 nanoparticle, becoming almost negligible. This is due to the contribution of the partially filled Ru 4d orbitals with Kohn–Sham energies spanning in the energy range of those of the O 2p occupied and Ti 3d empty manifolds. This feature is systematically observes no matter the interaction involves the oxide nanoparticle facet or edge regions.

    "abstract": "Abstract The impact of the connection modes between donor (D) and acceptor (A) on the luminescence properties is revealed for organic D‐A‐D emitters based on triphenylamine (TPA) and 9,10‐phenanthroquinone (PAQ). When TPA and PAQ are linked via a single bond, the emitters exhibit small energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (∆ E ST ) due to the separated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions, thus featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Interestingly, for the emitters with TPA and PAQ sharing a benzene ring, the ∆ E ST are significantly increased because of the enhanced overlap between the HOMO and LUMO, which is beneficial to realize room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Moreover, upon changing the connection from β to γ‐position, high‐lying triplet states can become energetically lower than the lowest singlet excited state, thus affording additional channels to facilitate TADF and RTP. This work sheds some light on controlling of the excited state energy level alignments via modulating the D‐A connection modes to tune molecular emission from TADF to RTP.",

First‐principles calculation is utilized to study the adhesion work, interfacial energy, electronic structure, bonding properties, and tensile properties between γ phase (Ni (001)) and γ' phase (Ni 3 Al (001)). The results show that the interface energy of the NiAl‐center (0.35–1.19 J m −2 ) is the smallest and therefore it is with the highest interface bonding strength. The electronic analysis suggests that strong Ni‐Al covalent and ionic bonds as well as Ni‐Ni metal bonds at the interface of the NiAl‐center model are formed with the appearance of obvious orbital hybridization. The yield strength of the NiAl‐top model reaches up to 19.38 GPa under the uniaxial tensile test, which is further increased when doped with those atoms of Re, Ta, and W, up to 20.38, 20.42, and 20.93 GPa, respectively.

Density functional theory calculations of water adsorption on these surfaces are performed to gain insight into water adsorption and proton migration processes, as well as thermodynamics of hydrogen evolution reaction within the framework of computational hydrogen electrode. It is concluded that ridges of single‐ and double‐stepped surfaces are nearly identical in terms of adsorption configurations and energetics.

Herein, the feasibility of the N 2 O reduction reaction over pristine C 2 N and TM/C 2 N (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) monolayers are explored by density functional theory calculations with Grimme‐D3 correction. The results reveal that the existence of TM atoms indeed improves the adsorption performance of C 2 N, where the TM atoms act as both electron acceptors and donors, favoring the activation of N 2 O and CO molecules. Based on thermal stability, selectivity, and catalytic activity, TM/C 2 N (TM = V and Mn) catalysts are screened from the above transition metal atoms. In particular, N 2 O reduction is a thermodynamically and kinetically favorable pathway, which can take place with negligible energy barriers on V/C 2 N and Mn/C 2 N catalysts. The CO 2 desorption on V/C 2 N and Mn/C 2 N catalysts is the rate‐limiting step with the desorption barrier of only 13.1 and 15.1 kcal mol −1 , respectively.

With the first principle approach of density functional theory (DFT), the geometric structure, Mulliken population, partial densities of states, and electron density difference are adopted to study the adsorption characteristics and binding strength of H 3 BO 3 and LiOH on Zr matrix. The results show that when H 3 BO 3 and LiOH react on the Zr matrix, there is formation of hybrid peaks and new bonds between surface molecules and the matrix. Meanwhile, the vertical molecule has a substantial impact on electron movement between adsorbs and the matrix.

To fill this gap, this article reports a theoretical description of thermal transport in single crystals made of terthiophene as prototypical system based on the three most popular molecular dynamics approaches. A systematic comparison of the computed values of thermal conductivity and its anisotropy is carried out and the strengths and weaknesses associated with each method are discussed. Although the three algorithms give essentially the same trends, this study points to the “AEMD” approach as the most suitable compromise between accuracy and computing cost. On the material aspects, the theoretical modeling yields an anisotropic character of the thermal transport in crystals whose out‐of‐plane thermal conductivity component is approximately twice larger than the in‐plane components. The AEMD approach is further used to investigate the influence of temperature on thermal transport in terthiophene. The trends are utterly rationalized by relying on the concepts of phonon mean free paths and phonon group velocities.",

The physical model is composed of perovskite spheres based on TiO 2 and PDMS with the nanostructure. The size parameters of the photovoltaic devices are optimized and the wide‐angle absorption characteristics of PSCs with NSPC structure are investigated. Simulation results verify the superior optical performance of the new PSCs with a maximum photocurrent of 25.77 mA cm −2 , which is 2.17 mA cm −2 higher than that of the conventional flat structured PSCs (23.60 mA cm −2 ). The results of the wide‐angle study demonstrate that the novel PSCs have omnidirectional absorption of photons. To elucidate the light‐trapping mechanism of the novel PSCs, the electric and magnetic field distributions of different structural PSCs are analyzed. The physical model the authors establish provides a solid theoretical basis for the research and development of PSCs with ultra‐low surface reflection loss and ultra‐high performance.",

The analysis include the effect of 2D or 3D percolation transport (PT) and the influence of a shallow exponential trap distribution on the transport. Under these considerations, a non‐constant accumulation layer thickness along the channel can be formed, resulting in a non‐constant effective mobility. The accumulation thickness can depict 2D or 3D PT or even a transition between them. This transition can produce a non‐ideal profile between the linear and saturation regimes in the output curve, region in which a lump appears. Other analyzed phenomenon is the non‐linear behavior for low drain voltage in the output curve, even considering an ohmic contact. This phenomenon is attributed to the traps distribution profile into the semiconductor and the thin accumulation layer thickness close to the injection contact. The conditions when the linear field effect mobility is higher or lower than the saturation one is also analyzed. Finally, electrolyte‐gated organic field effect transistors and OECT experimental data are successfully fitted with this model showing its versatility.",

A novel simulation scheme is devised to characterize the effective frequency of surface diffusion and intermixing events overcoming the inherent difficulties related to their interdependency in heteroepitaxial systems. The effective energy barriers of these events encompass different atomistic mechanisms weighted by their occurrence probabilities. The overall description of surface diffusion and intermixing based on Stillinger–Weber (SW) potential is in agreement with ab initio calculations and experimental observations, though some atomistic details differ. This study is extended to Si(001) substrates with stressed Ge monolayers grown on top. It is found that Ge ad‐atom dynamics is accelerated with respect to the case of the pure Si substrate and that diffusion across dimer rows is mainly mediated by the atomic exchange of the Ge ad‐atom with a Ge atom on the surface.",

Five AA‐ and AB‐stacked bilayer and eight AAB‐stacked trilayer structures are considered. The AAB‐stacked trilayer h BN (TL‐BN) structures are constructed by mixing the AA‐ and AB‐stacked bilayer h BN (BL‐BN). It is shown that the GW approximation gives rise to different types (i.e., indirect or direct) of fundamental bandgaps from the independent particle approximation for all structures except those dominated by the B–B opposite. The stacking modes dominated by the B–B opposite have a direct fundamental bandgap in both approximations. The OPA spectra are calculated by solving the BSE combined with the GW quasi‐particle correction. The binding energy and Davydov splitting of excitons of TL‐BN strongly depend on the opposite atoms and are related to the role of the stacking BL‐BN substructure. Finally, taking the six‐layer and below AB‐stacked structures as examples, it is shown that the B–B opposite unit is helpful in constructing the turbostratic‐phase‐like stacking structures with a direct fundamental bandgap which are more suitable for optoelectronic applications.",

Additionally, the intranuclear minimal region (IMR) is set as a reference for the concept of the intranuclear domain in the microdosimetric kinetic model, and the BPA equivalent dose concentration to the IMR is estimated. The required boron delivery dose greatly varies depending on the dose assessment based on the accumulation characteristics of boron agents in intracellular organelles.

Based on coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) for behaviors, TCAD can calculate objects such as impurities, point defects, and electronic carriers in semiconductors. However, over recent years semiconductor devices have become increasingly miniaturized and complicated, resulting in much longer calculation times for TCAD. Machine learning is one technology that may be used to overcome this simulation cost problem. In this study, a neural network architecture is proposed that considers the structure of the coupled PDEs. Features representing each concentration distribution of the calculation objects are extracted by convolution operations and their reaction is modeled by channel attention. The performance of the proposed architecture and of conventional neural network models is evaluated using a simulation dataset generated by 1D coupled PDEs that models the diffusion and reaction of vacancies and interstitial atoms. In addition, the advantage of the method is discussed through the analyses of error correlations of the two predictions and attention coefficients. The machine learning method developed in this study will be applicable to other physics described by coupled PDEs and is expected to speed up the computation of simulations in various fields.",

These disadvantageous properties of FP limit its use to cases with highly controlled initial and boundary conditions. It is shown with results in simulation that these problems can be mitigated in three ways through the application of closed‐loop control. First, it is shown that a target front speed can be enforced by locally controlling the temperature field during FP via an external heat source. Second, it is shown that this method prevents unstable front propagation and quenching despite adverse initial and boundary conditions. Third, it is shown that this method minimizes cure time and energy consumption compared to bulk heating.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the challenges faced by behavioral scientists is the lack of modeling methodologies for accurately determining when a behavior becomes problematic. The authors propose “behavioral posology” as a novel modeling paradigm for quantifying the healthy limits of behaviors through the concept of behavioral dose. As an example of this paradigm, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of a hypothetical digital behavior is presented, based on opponent process theory. The generic model can be adapted to simulate Solomon and Corbit's model of affective dynamics from 1974, and the model predicts features of addiction such as hedonic allostasis, withdrawal, and apparent tolerance. A behavioral frequency response analysis (BFRA) of the model demonstrates how behavior repetition may result in a hormetic dose–response relationship that depends on the frequency of the behavior. The model can be experimentally validated using Ecological Momentary Assessment, allowing researchers to hypothesize, model, and test causal mechanisms for behavioral addictions. The potential for behavioral posology to be applied as a clinical support tool in psychological medicine is discussed, as this modeling framework may help to detect and limit behaviors being performed too frequently based on factors such as the person's moral beliefs.",

The microstructure is simulated directly from the X‐ray computed tomography data and the nanostructure is combined with the pseudo‐2D simulation approach, where the morphological parameters and the distribution of the binder, carbon, and LiFePO 4 are obtained from ex situ focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy measurements. The discharge performance shows that the lamellar structure exhibits a lower ohmic overvoltage and achieves a higher gravimetric capacity compared to the cellular structure, even though both electrode materials have the same porosity and amount of active material. The simulation reveals that the performance is not only directly influenced by the lithium‐ion transport through the porous structure but also by the current distribution through the active material. Based on these insights, lamellar electrode structures should be considered for next‐generation battery electrodes. The modeling approach can assist in electrode fabrication by identifying defects or suggesting better structural parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a novel approach to designing digital composite materials with desired mechanical properties by exploring a broad design space based on the spatial arrangements of binary constituents with a variety of materials' properties. Deep learning (DL) models that are trained on limited volume fraction (VF) ratios and limited materials' properties often struggle to accurately predict the mechanical responses of configurations that are not encompassed in the training data. To address this issue, an advanced multi‐input deep learning approach is proposed, enhanced by transfer learning and a multi‐kernel method. This approach can predict the stress field for both seen and unseen configurations in terms of the material properties and VF ratios, while accurately pinpointing stress concentrations at the interface. It can predict stress distribution from finite element method (FEM) accurately with significantly low computational cost, making it an efficient tool for the rapid design and optimization of composites. The incorporation of multiscale kernels in the model enables better capture of local and global features, resulting in more precise predictions. Transfer learning (TL) in the model proves to be an exceptional strategy for exploring new design spaces with minimal data augmentation. This research underscores the potential of DL models in advancing composite materials.",

However, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood, especially the EE dynamics, which govern reaction mechanisms. Here, using a hybrid functional‐based ab initio molecular dynamic simulation strategy, it accurately characterizes the dynamics details of CO 2 R by aqueous EEs in solution and uncovers the nature of how EEs migrate for efficient CO 2 R. The AIMD simulations reveal that the injected EEs undergo hydration with diverse hydrated forms (various pre‐hydrated/e − pre /e 2 2− pre and hydrated/e − aq /e 2 2− aq ) and multiple reaction channels due to competition of hydration versus migration. Interestingly, all pathways go through the same relay state [CO 2 2− ] aq and reach the same product (HCOO − ). The core process before [CO 2 2− ] aq is competitive electron hydration and possible e − pre ‐migration featuring either slowly flowing or fast jumping mode, while that after [CO 2 2− ] aq is proton transfer catalyzed by H‐bonding network as a proton source. The nature is how the concerted hydration dynamics of EEs and target CO 2 govern the reaction proceeding through modulating their energy gap . This study provides dynamics insights into CO 2 R in aqueous solution by diverse e − pre /e − aq and the proposed strategy can also be utilized to explore the reduction mechanisms based on pre‐solvated electrons in other media.",

To expedite the development of PSC devices, it is crucial to establish seamless connections between relevant parameters, thereby saving time and reducing the costs associated with actual experimentation. This capability can be achieved through advanced machine learning (ML) models, which are at the forefront of providing such interrelation capabilities. In this investigation, a comprehensive ML pipeline using scientific data from PSCs is established, which includes data processing methods and synthetic data generation. Various ML models such as linear, logic‐tree‐based, gradient‐based, discriminative‐based, and attention‐based neural network regressors are utilized to predict PCE of PSCs. The results indicate that the XG‐Boost ML algorithm displays a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.52, while the attention‐based neural network model TabNet also demonstrates an MAE as low as 1.62. Furthermore, the coefficient of determination for these models is as high as 0.919 and 0.915, respectively.

Multiple potential host rocks contain phyllosilicates, which have shown high efficiency in radionuclide sorption. Recent experimental studies report a heterogeneous distribution of adsorbed radionuclides on nanotopographic mineral surfaces. In this study, the energetic differences of surface sorption sites available at nanotopographic structures such as steps, pits, and terraces are investigated. Eleven important surface sites are selected and the energies of ad‐ and desorption reactions are obtained from density functional theory calculations. The adsorption energies are then used for the parameterization of a kinetic Monte Carlo model simulating the distribution of adsorbed europium on a typical nanotopographic muscovite surface. On muscovite, silicon step sites are favorable for europium sorption and lead to an increased adsorption in regions with high step concentrations. Under identical chemical conditions, sorption on typical nanotopographic surfaces is increased by a factor of three compared to atomically flat surfaces. Desorption occurs preferentially at terrace sites, leading to an overall 2.5 times increased retention at nanotopographic structures. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for heterogeneous sorption on nanotopographic mineral surfaces due to the availability of energetically favorable sorption sites.",

To inhibit its function, a potent inhibitor called NP‐G2‐044 is currently in phase II clinical trials. However, the binding mode of this inhibitor remains unclear. In this study, the binding mode of NP‐G2‐044 in fascin and predicted drug resistance mutations is investigated. The rough binding position and pose can be deduce based on information from its derivant NP‐G2‐029, whose crystal structure with fascin has been solved. Molecular docking, free energy perturbation (FEP) simulation and metadynamics simulation are performed to confirm the binding pose. Based on the molecular docking results, two binding modes of NP‐G2‐044, pose A and B, are obtained, with pose A being more favorable. For pose A, the planar indazole moiety has the same orientation as NP‐G2‐029 in the complex with fascin, while for pose B, it rotates ≈90°. FEP and metadynamics simulations indicate that both binding poses are possible. Relative binding free energies for mutation effects calculated by FEP predict E215A and R217A are drug resistance mutations. These findings are important for further drug development targeting fascin.",

To achieve this, the free energy profile is constructed along with a pre‐established collective variable within the melting transition and cleavage processes. The values of the solid surface and solid–liquid interface free energies are then extrapolated from the excess free energy related to the formation and persistence of the solid surface or the solid–liquid interface. Furthermore, this methodology is employed to calculate the temperature dependence of the free energy measurements for the (100) and (110) surfaces and interfaces of Cu.

Different control strategies are designed for the cruise mode and car‐following mode of the ACC system. A proportion integral differential (PID) controller is used to meet the need for speed control in cruise mode. For the car‐following mode, a multi‐objective ACC system distance control strategy is proposed considering the performance of car following, passenger comfort, driving safety and driving economy of ACC vehicles. The weight coefficients in the objective function are updated in real time by using the fuzzy model predictive control (FMPC) strategy to meet the needs of different road conditions and improve the driving economy. Then, the desired front wheel steering angle is obtained by preview control theory. According to the theory of sliding mode control (SMC), a lateral stability controller is designed to track the desired yaw rate and sideslip angle. Simulation results show that the electric vehicle driven by in‐wheel motors based on FMPC and SMC has better car‐following performance and lateral stability performance under variable curvature curved road conditions.",

Although much attention is paid to its material removal mechanism, producing a high‐quality SiC surface with a high material removal rate is still a challenging issue. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the material removal mechanism of SiC to improve the processing performance. In this study, the laser heating‐assisted nanocutting models are established using a molecular dynamics method. Then, a laser beam with various energies is irradiated onto the SiC. The influence of average laser power on the nanocutting mechanism of SiC is revealed in terms of the temperature of the machined region, cutting force, stress distribution state, subsurface damage, and tool wear. The results demonstrate that within the scope of this study, the using of laser irradiation methods has a positive effect on the machinability of SiC at the nanoscale, provided that the laser power density does not exceed the ablation threshold. Meanwhile, the results indicate that laser heating‐assisted methods have played an important role in suppressing tool wear.

Here, a computational method is presented to simulate network growth as a stochastic process using reaction‐diffusion master equations. The evolving diffusivity of reacting species during polymerization is modeled using effective medium method, thereby making the rates of reaction and fluctuation events sensitive to the spatial configuration of a growing network. The numerical studies show that this method can correlate fabrication parameters to polymer properties like crosslink heterogeneity, relaxation time, phonon density of states, and bulk modulus, in silico.

Adsorption of graphene on the surfaces of heavy-metals was proposed to induce the strong spin-splitting of the graphene $\\pi$-bands either via Rashba effect or due to the induced spin-orbit effects via hybridization of the valence band states of graphene and metal. The spin-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy experiments performed on graphene adsorbed on the substrates containing heavy elements demonstrate the \"giant\" spin-splitting of the $\\pi$ states of the order of 100 meV in the vicinity of the Fermi level ($E_F$) and the K point. However, the recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments did not confirm these findings, leaving the fact of the observation of the \"giant\" Rashba effect or induced spin-orbit interaction in graphene still open. Thus, a detailed understanding of the physics in such systems is indispensable. From a theory side this requires, first of all, correct modeling of the graphene/metal interfaces under study. Here we present realistic super-cell density-functional theory calculations, including dispersion interaction and spin-orbit interaction, for several graphene/high-Z-metal interfaces. While correctly reproduce the spin-splitting features of the metallic surfaces, their modifications under graphene adsorption and doping level of graphene, our studies reveal that neither \"giant\" Rashba- nor spin-orbit induced splitting of the graphene pi states around $E_F$ take place.",

In order to determine whether this improvement originates from electronic doping or surface composition changes induced by ion implantation, a theoretical approach using quantum‐chemical and force‐field methods combined with X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy is performed. The results indicate that neither an electronic effect nor a lattice distortion appear to be the primary cause of the hardness improvement. It is rather a change in the surface composition leading to a more densely cross‐linked and stiffer silica network at the top surface of the glass which is at the origin of this improvement.",

The exchanging process occurs in a large variety of natural and artificially induced phenomena which are of major relevance to several leading fields of academic research and modern technology. In this Progress Report, an overview of problems in current materials science and chemical physics is presented where the corresponding computational approaches require the concept of an electronic system with open boundaries. Quantum and quantum/classical computational techniques treat the exchange of electrons with the environment at different computational efficiency, conceptual rigorousness, and numerical accuracy. The overall emerging picture shows a rich availability of interesting ideas, some with a higher weight on the pragmatic side, others with higher weight on the conceptual side; possible combinations, in perspective, may push the field much beyond its current frontiers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The dispersion characteristics of electromagnetic waves have led to a wide range of applications, such as pulse compression, superluminal propagation, wave tunneling effect, and electron–wave interaction. The near‐cutoff wave inside a guiding system is strong dispersive. When the wave frequency reaches the terahertz band, this strong dispersive property is extremely sensitive to the losses induced by the limited conductivity of the component. This phenomenon is traditionally investigated through perturbation of boundary conditions in the frequency domain, which does not deal well with broad‐spectrum signals. Two simple and efficient time‐domain schemes to study the strong dispersive propagation of terahertz waves are proposed. One is based on relatively concise principles, called the constant frequency method. The second is the recursive convolution method, which is suitable for dealing with a wave with wider spectrum range. The reliability of both approaches is verified by the comparison of the dispersion curves. Using the proposed methods, the pulse compression of terahertz wave inside a strong dispersive waveguide is verified in principle.",

In the new last‐passage algorithm, an off‐centered point on the flat surface inside the Green's function hemisphere can also be used. To demonstrate the algorithm, the charge density on a circular disk is calculated and it is found that the result agrees very well with the analytic solution. Compared with the previous centered LP, the generalized algorithm is better in most cases and has an advantage that it can use the same potential distribution over the LP hemisphere for different locations inside of the lower flat surface including the center of the hemisphere for the charge density.",

This requires larger grain sizes in polycrystalline ceramics to reduce phonon scattering at grain boundaries. However, smaller grain sizes are preferred to minimize light scattering in the Rayleigh regime in polycrystals made from birefringent materials such as AlN and Al 2 O 3 , which are otherwise appealing for their high k . An optimization challenge arises from the opposite scaling laws governing the effects of grain sizes on k and light transmission. Here, this is tackled by introducing anisotropically microstructured materials (columnar/disk‐shaped grains) as the lasing media, and allowing orthogonal heat transfer and lasing directions. For columnar grains, larger grain sizes along the c ‐axis help maintain high k for good heat dissipation, while preserving light transmission properties in the orthogonal lasing and pumping directions. Analytical models for the thermal conductivity in such structures are presented and verified using Monte‐Carlo ray‐tracing simulations. Similarly, an approximate Rayleigh–Gans–Debye model is used to predict light transmission and verified with exact simulations using FEM software. Finally, the tradeoff between thermal and optical phenomena is captured in a new anisotropic figure‐of‐merit tensor, which is optimized for the microstructure that maximizes lasing media performance in AlN and Al 2 O 3 model systems.",

It is demonstrated that the polymer matrix should have the lowest Young's modulus and permittivity as possible, in order to maximize the output voltage and power. Four different materials, which have already been proposed in literature for such composite VING, are then compared: Parylene C, poly(methyl methacrylate), Al 2 O 3 , and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Simulation results show that PDMS, which has the lowest values of both Young's modulus and permittivity, gives the highest output performance. Finally, the sensitivity to another design parameter—the surface density of the NWs—is calculated, and it is shown that choosing a polymer material with the lowest Young's modulus and permittivity is more powerful to improve the VING performance.",

Thus, an efficient and reliable method to profile morphological differences is needed. In this study, deep learning is used in cell image analysis to demonstrate its ability to find non‐apparent cell morphology differences. The convolutional neural network can accurately classify cell images from substrates of different stiffness that are undistinguishable to the human eye or conventional statistical methods. Moreover, with analysis of feature maps, and the assistance of a fully connected neural network and a random forest classifier, morphological information in images is systematically proved as the main basis of classification for the deep learning model. The above results indicate that deep learning is valuable for the in‐depth analysis of morphology to better understand subtle changes in cells, which can provide people with deeper insights into cell biology.",

The quasi‐particle band structure and light absorbance of the C 3 B/SiC 2 can be tuned significantly under different interlayer coupling induced by the stacking modes. They both exhibit strong optical absorbance coefficients (larger than 10 5 cm –1 ) in the energy range of near‐infrared to near‐ultraviolet light. More interestingly, the observed binding energies of excitons are as large as ≈800 meV in the C 3 B/SiC 2 , which can slow the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron‐hole pairs, thus increasing the efficiency of solar energy conversion. A power conversion efficiency of ≈18.9% can be achieved in the C 3 B/SiC 2 . These results indicate that the C 3 B/SiC 2 heterobilayer has potential applications in the optoelectronic devices.",

Using this approach, the structures and stability trends of Ti n clusters in the size range previously reported, are reproduced.

The simulation results prove that servo amplifier gain, viscous friction coefficient and dead band are sensitive structural parameters that affect the dynamic performance of the gas turbines. In the proposed appropriate interval, the optimal sensitive parameters can reduce the overshoot and adjustment time by about 51% and 7%. The gain of the servo amplifier is positively correlated with the maximum opening of the VSV.

The PN is modeled by a linear elastic constitutive model. When TN polymers are taken into the PN by crosslinking reaction, the instantaneous deformation of the TN polymers are frozen, and such frozen deformations are accumulated as time goes on.

Anomalously large electromechanical responses are explored in nonlinearly graded ferroelectric thin films made of BaSr x TiO 3 , where SrTiO 3 mole fraction varies across the film thickness according to power‐law relationships. In addition, a large gradient of polarization can be stabilized in graded ferroelectric thin films, where both magnitude and gradient of polarization can be manipulated by controlling the gradient index of thin films. The remarkable enhancement of electromechanical properties originates from the large gradient of polarization in thin films, which makes the polarization field more susceptible to external excitation. An optimal gradient index for maximizing the electromechanical response is also identified. Furthermore, a consideration of energy properties of graded thin films suggests that both energy storage density and charge–discharge efficiency increase with increasing gradient index of thin films.",

Many countries have imposed export restrictions on PPE to ensure the sufficient domestic supply. The surging demand and export restrictions cause shortage contagions on the global PPE trade network. Here, an integrated network model is developed, which integrates a metapopulation model and a threshold model, to investigate the shortage contagion patterns. The metapopulation model captures disease contagion across countries. The threshold model captures the shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network. Due to the Pareto distribution in global exports, the shortage contagion pattern is mainly determined by the export restriction policies of the top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the disease contagion. To some extent, export restrictions can provide benefits for self-sufficient countries, at the sacrifice of immediate economic shocks at not-self-sufficient countries. With export restrictions, a large amount of PPE is hoarded instead of being distributed to where it is most needed, particularly at the early stage. Cooperation between countries plays an essential role in preventing global shortages of PPE regardless of the production level. Except for promoting global cooperation, governments and international organizations should take actions to reduce supply chain barriers and work together to increase global PPE production.",

The proposed tailored superlattices are stable and differ from the regular superlattices through broken and missing PO 4 tetrahedra. As a result, the p–d covalent bondings become reasonable and transition metal ions are forced to stabilize in fractional charge state instead of the integer‐charge state observed in bulk. These result in partially occupied parabolic dispersive bands to favor the metallic phase and therefore open up the possibilities to go beyond the conventional layered perovskite polar interfaces to create metallic heterostructures out of insulating oxides. Out of all M‐Mʹ combinations, we find that Cr‐Mn, Cr‐Co, Cr‐Ni, Mn‐Co and Mn‐Ni combinations yield the FM‐M phase as ground state in the tailored superlattices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Developing protocols for making thin sheet FeGa (Galfenol) with abnormally grown Goss or Cube grains, which provide maximum magnetostriction, is challenging because the mechanisms that regulate grain boundary mobility and texture development in these alloys are not yet understood. Grain boundary energy models do not account for forces caused by the control of surface energy from atmospheric annealing conditions. By characterizing the surface energy of specific Galfenol grains, we can develop a more accurate thermodynamic framework for modeling abnormal grain growth and texture development. To non‐destructively measure surface energy of specific crystal orientations and overcome passivation layer difficulties in previous studies, a two‐liquid‐phase contact angle method is utilized. A single‐crystal (1 0 0) Fe 82 Ga 18 is used as a proof of concept for its isotropic surface crystal orientation. The resultant contact angle data shows a high dependence on the use of Ar‐plasma surface preparation to remove native oxides exposing a true interaction between a sessile drop and the Galfenol surface. Experimentally measured surface energy values are in agreement with density functional theory simulations. Surface texture and composition are confirmed using EBSD and XPS measurements. This non‐destructive technique paves the way towards studying surface energies of bare metal surfaces.",

Hamiltonians are a fundamental part for studying quasiparticles and vortices, and provide models to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that describe a real physical state. By devising supersymmetry, a Hamiltonian for the description of vortices is developed forming in an 2D electron gas and study the numerical solutions under the effects of an alternating electromagnetic field. The numerical analysis shows that vorticity is formed spontaneously without symmetry‐breaking and vortices arise from the boundaries and converge toward the center of the system in a similar fashion to natural hydrodynamic phenomena in water or plasma. Additionally, the equation under damping conditions is studied, a homogenous magnetic field and under the absence of an electromagnetic field. The results and the study of the parameters indicate that the supersymmetic wave equation (SWE) may be a good model equation to describe vorticity for quantum electromagnetics, hydrodynamics, and other physical phenomena in the realm of physical and quantum physical sciences.",

In vivo animal experiments have shown that the output power of flexible device depends heavily on the patching orientations. In this paper, an electromechanical model with the effects of myocardial fiber is developed to better understand the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and therefore to choose optimal patching orientations for energy harvesting. Theoretical output voltage of the piezoelectric energy harvester under the heart motion in one cardiac cycle is calculated, and the voltage amplitudes of the harvester with varied patching orientations are compared with the experimental measurements. It is found that the output voltage amplitudes are generally the cosine function of the angle between patching orientation of the piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) and the fiber orientation of the epicardium. The results may serve as a guideline to determine the optimal patching orientation of flexible PEHs mounted on surfaces of fiber structure.",

The results indicate that 2–5 have stronger oscillator strength and higher fluorescence radiative rate ( k r ) after introducing linked bridges. But, the increased local‐excitation and decreased charge‐transfer natures in the lowest singlet and triplet excited states lead to larger singlet‐triplet energy splitting (Δ Ε ST ) for 2–5 than 1 . The potential reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) channels are speculated for 1–5 by considering the higher triplet excited state and spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) matrix element. It is concluded that the introduction of bridges noticeably enhances the SOC between singlet (S n ) and triplet (T n ) excited states. By analyzing the excited state energies and transition natures, 2 and 3 are expected to undergo a T 3 to S 1 RISC process, and 4 and 5 are expected to undergo a RISC more significantly via T 2 to S 1 because of the almost equal energy levels and strong SOC.",

Here, the electronic structures of the tunable band‐gap semiconductor of 2D InSe nanosheets and the band structure and electronic transport properties of quasi‐1D InSe nanoribbons (ISNs) are presented by using the first‐principles method. The calculated band structures show that an enlarged indirect band gap appears in 2D InSe nanosheet by external strain, and the gap reduces monotonically as the strain changing from the compression to stretch independent of the zigzag or armchair direction. Moreover, the band structures of quasi‐1D ISNs show that armchair ISNs are all nonmagnetic semiconductors, and the zigzag ISNs (zISNs) exhibit metallic regardless of the ribbon width or magnetic states. The non‐equilibrium Green's function calculation reveals the electronic transport properties of zISNs with different widths. An obvious negative differential resistive (NDR) effect is found in the current–voltage curves independent of the ribbon width due to the bias‐dependent transmission within the voltage window. The tunable band‐gap semiconductor behavior of 2D InSe nanosheet and the novel NDR effect in quasi‐1D zISNs indicate a very promising application of InSe‐based nanomaterials in electronic nanodevices.",

It is found that the three composites exhibit percolated or independent microvoids of different degrees of interconnectivity, sizes, and positions at the MOF/polymer interface that contribute to decrease the polymer surface coverage, a signature of a relatively poor adhesion between the two components. The ftw ‐MOF‐BPTC‐based composite, however, shows a partial penetration of the polymer in the MOF first pore layer, hinting a slightly higher affinity between the MOF and the polymer. These results suggest that even when considering MOFs surfaces with drastically different morphologies, finding a highly compatible MOF/polymer pair for rigid polymers remains challenging.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanism by which cell‐penetrating peptides and antimicrobial peptides cross plasma membranes is unknown, as is how cell‐penetrating peptides facilitate drug delivery, mediating the transport of small molecules. Once nondisruptive and nonendocytotic pathways are excluded, pore formation is one of the proposed mechanisms, including toroidal, barrel‐stave, or carpet models. Spontaneous pores are observed in coarse‐grained simulations and less often in molecular dynamics simulations. While pores are widely assumed and inferred, there is no unambiguous experimental evidence of the existence of pores. Some recent experimental studies contradict the mechanistic picture of pore formation, however, highlighting the possibility of a direct translocation pathway that is both nondisruptive and nonendocytotic. In this work, a model is proposed a model for peptide (linear and dendritic) translocation which does not require the presence of pores and which potentially accords with such experiments. It is suggested that a charged peptide, as it experiences an increasingly hydrophobic environment within the membrane surface, can utilize a proton chain transfer mechanism to shed its protons to counter ions or potentially phospholipid head groups in the membrane skin region, thereby becoming compatible with the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. This increases the likelihood to move into the highly hydrophobic core of the membrane and ultimately reach the opposite leaflet to re‐acquire protons again, suggesting a potential “chameleon” mechanism for non‐disruptive and non‐endocytotic membrane translocation. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal stability of peptide bridges joining two membrane leaflets and demonstrate that this can facilitate cross‐membrane transport of small drug molecules.",

After that, DAG‐SVM based classifier are used to predict the classes of PQ disturbances. The NSGA III algorithm generates optimalsolutions based on multi objective optimization and then fitness function is generated with the help of Pareto front to obtain unique features set from power signals. The NSGA III not only optimizes selected features with DTCWT but also reduces the computational time in comparison with the traditional NSGA II. The obtained unique feature vectors are used for training of Directed Acyclic Graph‐SVM to classify the power quality disturbances. The short event detection, lesser computational timing, superior classification accuracy, and high anti‐noise performance are the main advantages of the proposed method.",

They generally exhibit fluctuations of orientational order, starting with its lowest moment, the polar order, which in the isotropic phase is geometrically decoupled from density. As a contrast, quadrupolar (nematic) orientational fluctuations are inherently coupled to density fluctuations already in the isotropic system and not subject to the existence of an orientational phase transition. To capture this, it takes the tensorial description of the nematic order, leading to a geometrical coupling between density and orientational order in the form of a tensorial conservation law. This coupling implies that a spatial density variation will induce nematic order and thereby an acoustic or osmotic optical birefringence even in isotropic phase. The theory is validated by performing detailed Monte Carlo simulations of isotropic melts and comparing the results with macroscopic predictions. This also exposits a means of determining the macroscopic parameters by microscopic simulations to yield realistic continuum models of specific polymeric materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The bulk photovoltaic effect shift current (SC), a constant photocurrent generated by irradiating polar homogeneous non‐centrosymmetric materials has lately emerged as a possible option for next‐generation photovoltaic systems that may potentially overcome the Shockley–Queisser limits. The current work predicts gigantic and anisotropic SC with multiple peaks across a wide range of frequencies in pristine 2D monolayer α‐AsP and α‐NP based on first‐principle calculations. The dominant SC tensors components hosted by 2D monolayer α‐AsP and α‐NP are the in‐plane, and reaches peaks of −154 µАV −2 , and 87 µАV −2 , respectively, in the UV region. The SC magnitudes of the α‐AsP are not significantly affected by the spin‐orbital coupling, while in α‐NP, no such effect occurs. This study recommends new photovoltaic materials with strong SC peaks spread across the electromagnetic spectrum, largely within the UV region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Commensurable twisted bilayers can drastically change the magnetic properties of chromium trihalide layered compounds, which opens novel opportunities for tuning magnetic states through layer rotations. Here, a mathematical approach to obtain moiré patterns in twisted hexagonal bilayers by performing a certain commensurable rotation θ over one layer is presented. To test the approach, moiré structures with and 32.20° in the phases R and C2/m of CrI 3 are obtained via the related methodology. For comparison purposes, a non‐shifted CrI 3 structure is also considered. Electronic and magnetic properties of the so‐obtained systems are computed by ab initio methodologies. Results show the presence of rotation‐angle‐dependent magnetic configurations and steep modifications of the dispersion bands due to variations in the nearest and next nearest distances among layers of Cr atoms. Modifications obtained from these commensurable rotations are discussed on the basis of competition among different energy contributions due to changes in the atomic neighborhood.",

In this study, a data set of over 60 000 unique graphene oxide nanoflakes and supervised machine learning methods are used to predict the probability of observation (stability) with perfect accuracy, based on a limited set of structural features that can be controlled in advance. A decision tree is used to show how the features determine the stability, and a neural network provides an equation to predict the thermodynamic stability of virtually any configuration in minutes. This enables researchers to use machine learning as research planning tool or to assist in analyzing results from microanalysis.",

Semiconductor heterostructure consisting of 2D ferromagnet integrated with other suitable 2D semiconducting materials may pave the way for designing robust and sophisticated spin‐transport devices within a few nanometer scales. In this regard, a detailed understanding of the interface properties of 2D ferromagnetic materials and other 2D semiconductors is highly essential.

This study predicts that a robust spin‐dependent barrier originated at the CrX 3 /TMDC interface. It can lead to a significantly large spin‐filtering at the interface while spin‐transport through this heterojunction, which will be highly beneficial for spintronic devices applications.

The deformation and displacement parameters, describing the deviation of the structural parameters of AgGaS 2 from ideal chalcopyrite structure, are determined. It is noticed that the significant discrepancies concerning peculiarities of the band structure between initial results of the DFT‐based calculation and the experiment for the titled crystal have been efficiently eliminated by choosing the proper DFT + U approach. By utilizing the calculated dielectric function for two principal directions, the refractive indices and extinction coefficients dispersions are determined. For the first time, the linear electro‐optic properties, electrogyration coefficients, and second‐order nonlinear optical coefficients of AgGaS 2 crystals are calculated in the frame of the DES model. The elastic properties of the AgGaS crystal are analyzed in the frame of the calculated full matrix of elastic coefficients. A number of parameters, such as Young's modulus E , Poisson's ratio ν , bulk B , and shear G moduli are predicted for the crystal. The calculated anisotropy coefficients for the moduli show very good agreement with ones available from experiment.",

A challenging case is the conversion of glucose and fructose to 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Ionic liquids (ILs) are often employed to boost the activity and selectivity of this process, although the isolation of HMF from the medium remains a major drawback. To investigate such solvent effects in a realistic (dynamic) environment, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of HMF are performed in imidazolium‐based ILs with different anions. Several parameters are identified that directly control HMF–anion interactions, which may hamper product separation, as well as HMF–HMF contacts, which can promote undesired side‐reactions. These computational results would guide future high‐throughput screenings of new and improved IL media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research interest in ceramic materials increased due to their extensive environmental, biomedical, and electronic applications. Increased demand for ceramics with specialized experimental conditions and limited resources has resulted in a higher cost for scientific practices and applications. Enormous material data is accumulated from traditional and high‐tech experimentation, but the manual recording process has shown inconsistencies in the analysis results. Recently, application based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has been able to address the issues of traditional scientific experiments in material science. However, no machine learning mechanisms are proposed for sophisticated data preparation and AI‐based discovery application of ceramics. This paper proposed an intelligent material data preparation mechanism based on ensemble learning for AI‐assisted material screening and discovery. The current method can potentially resolve the problems of missing and inconsistent material data. As a case study, a material data preparation platform for ceramic material data pre‐processing is developed. For performance evaluation of the proposed mechanism, machine learning regression models are trained before and after the imputation techniques applied to the data. Performance analysis shows that the ensemble model of deep learning network (DNN) and automated machine learning (autoML) performed better as compared to previously reported imputation approaches.",

This work derives an exact analytical solution, up to a quadrature, for the stationary electric potential and charge density distributions in both the semiconductor film and the electrolyte solution, and from them the sheet semiconductor charge and the stationary differential capacitance are obtained as a function of the applied voltage. The dependence of these magnitudes on the physical device parameters, like the ionic concentration of the electrolyte, the capacitance of the interfacial compact layers and the injected hole density is then analyzed. This work shows that ionic diffusive effects in the electrolyte can play an important role in the device response, inducing a broadening of the transition from the weak to the strong accumulation regimes. This fact can make that the strong accumulation regime is not achieved in OMES within the usual voltage operation range of these devices. The analytical solution is validated by means of finite element numerical calculations. The implications of the results obtained on the physics of electrolyte gated organic field effect transistors (EGOFETs) are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic levels of inflammation lead to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. A key molecular mediator responsible for the progression of these diseases is Chemokine C–C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), a homodimerized cytokine that dissociates into monomeric form and binds to the CCR2 receptor. CCL2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 (MCP‐1), attracts monocytes to migrate to areas of injury and mature into macrophages, leading to positive feedback inflammation with further release of proinflammatory molecules such as IL‐1β and TNF‐α. Sequestering CCL2 to prevent its binding to CCR2 may prevent this inflammatory activity. Prior work adapted an α‐helical CCL2‐binding peptide (WKNFQTI) from murine CCR2 through extracellular loop analysis. Here, higher‐affinity peptide binders are computationally designed through homology modeling and energy calculations, yielding an 11‐amino acid peptide with high binding affinity. In addition, Rosetta mutations improves binding affinity in silico with blockage of the CCL2 dimerization site. Future work in analyzing binding kinetics and in vivo inflammation abrogation will confirm the accuracy of computational modeling techniques in de novo rational design of CCL2 cytokine binders.",

The influence of applied biasing conditions and structural parameter specifications on the sensing performance of CMG‐NSFET and CMG‐NSTFET are methodically analyzed from device electrostatics and carrier transport mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative maximum sensitivity variations with H 2 ‐partial pressure, ambient temperature, and the presence of ambient Oxygen are comprehensively studied. The study reveals that compared to CMG‐NSFET, the CMG‐NSTFET demonstrates a high immunity against bias and doping variations, with a notably higher (&gt; 50%) sensitivity within low H 2 partial pressures (10 −15 – 10 −10 Torr). Next, the sensing performance of CMG‐NSTFET is systematically optimized through a band‐gap and gate‐stack engineering approach, leading to a 180% to 650% sensitivity improvement from lower (10 −15 Torr) to higher (10 −5 Torr) range of H 2 partial pressure.

First, through surface simulation, inverse fitting, and three‐dimensional (3D) modeling, more realistic simulation samples are obtained, real samples are prepared, and a simulation imaging system and an actual imaging experiment to acquire surface images are designed. Second, the data distribution difference between the simulation domain and the actual domain through transfer component analysis and the use of the adjusted simulation‐domain data and its label to train a support vector regression model is adjusted. Finally, the model predicts the surface roughness of the uncalibrated actual‐domain sample. For shared features of transferable simulation images and actual images, using the high sensitivity of color information, image features are enhanced and a proportion of pure color region index is designed, strongly correlated within the domain but less differentiated between domains. The results show that the transfer learning prediction accuracy based on this index exceeds 90%, verifying the feasibility of the proposed method and providing a new improvement strategy for sample expansion in visual roughness measurement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a lightweight YOLO object detection algorithm based on bidirectional multi‐scale feature enhancement. The problem is that the original YOLOv5 algorithm does not make full use of the relationship between the feature layers, resulting in the loss of target semantic information and a large number of parameters. First, a bidirectional multi‐scale feature‐enhanced weighted fusion backbone network is constructed to extract target features repeatedly. It enhances the fusion ability of shallow detail features and high‐level semantic information to capture richer multi‐scale semantic information. Second, the NCA attention module is built and integrated into the feature fusion network to enhance the critical characteristics of the target region. Finally, the Ghost module is used instead of the convolutional blocks in the original network to lighten the model while reducing the network complexity and training difficulty. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5 algorithm achieves 78.8% mAP@0.5 for the PASCAL VOC2012 dataset, which is 1.5% higher than the original algorithm, at 62.5 FPS. The number of parameters is also reduced by 43.6%. The mAP@0.5 on the self‐made metal foreign object dataset reached 98.4%, at 58.8 FPS, which can meet the requirements of end‐device deployment and real‐time detection.",

In the active state of LOXL2, its conserved catalytic domain has a lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor and a copper ion. LTQ is post‐translationally derived from Lys653 and Tyr689 of LOXL2. In this study, well‐tempered metadynamics simulations are used to investigate the conformation modulation from the inactive state to active state and obtain the free energy landscape. Interestingly, the simulations show that LTQ precursor residues cannot get close in Zn 2+ −bound LOXL2, whereas the copper ion binding triggers a conformation change to form an optional structure for LTQ biosynthesis. It is found that a prominent loop, consisting of residues 654–658, hinders the formation of LTQ in Zn 2+ −LOXL2 by preventing Lys653 from moving into active site of LOXL2, whereas this loop is relatively flexible in Cu 2+ −LOXL2. After the formation of LTQ, it needs to be activated by adjusting its position to be exposed to the solvent, thus allowing it to react with its substrate proteins. The results indicate that this process involves an intermediate state and that the activation of LTQ overcomes an energy barrier of 5.9 kcal mol −1 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Robotic drilling through direct cochlear access for cochlear implantation (CI) is currently a prominent area in the field of CI surgery. However, the safety of drilling remains an issue due to the limited space within the facial recess. Estimation and control of drilling force are critical to prevent drill‐bit breakthrough, excessive heat generation, and mechanical damage to the facial nerve. The bone drilling process presents a favorable application scenario for finite element (FE) analysis. In this study, a 3D FE model of temporal bone drilling is established for the first time to predict the drilling force. The self‐developed CI surgical robot validates these findings through experimental drilling. The experimental results show that the drilling process can be divided into three stages, and the corresponding force curve can be divided into six zones. The overall trend of temporal bone drilling is two force peaks and one trough in the middle. The drilling force is positively correlated with the feed rate. The FE results found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Numerical simulation can be utilized as an invaluable tool for assisting in predicting the position of drilling tools and optimizing drilling parameters in the future.",

Thus, strategically issuing active exit‐choice recommendations that provide clear and concise guidance to pedestrians can help improve evacuation safety and efficiency. This study investigates how to optimally regulate pedestrian density at the exits by generating time‐multiplexed exit‐choice recommendations. The study develops a simulated crowd evacuation scenario with multiple exits, where pedestrians receive periodic sequences of exit‐choice instructions. The optimal period for each instruction is obtained through simulation‐optimization processes with three minimization objectives: evacuation time, cumulative density, and cumulative density variance. First, the effect of collective behaviors on evacuation performance is studied, which justifies the need for active mechanisms to improve exit‐choice decision‐making coordination. Then, several optimal plans for the different objectives are obtained and evaluated regarding evacuation time and cumulative density performance. Finally, the influence of adoption rate and collective commitment to instructions are evaluated. This study suggests that static plans, defined as time‐multiplexed exit‐choice instructions obtained through simulation‐optimization, reasonably represent a first step in the real deployment of intelligent crowd management systems.",

A predictive control scheme with surge‐ and choke‐constrained awareness is proposed to ensure safe and efficient operation of air compressors in this study. The proposed scheme consists of an efficiency enhancement model predictive control (EE‐MPC), and an improved active disturbance rejection control (IADRC). Surge‐ and choke‐constrained awareness is achieved by comparing predicted air flow with surge and choke limitations. Simultaneously, the EE‐MPC is constrained with oxygen excess ratio (OER) and obtains optimal solution by searching active set. The reference flow and supply manifold pressure trajectories for IADRC are generated by EE‐MPC. A designed piecewise differentiable nonlinear smoothing function is embedded in IADRC. The disturbances are estimated for coordinating flow and pressure control. Under China heavy‐duty commercial vehicle test cycle for bus conditions, root‐mean‐squared errors (RMSEs) of flow and pressure are 3.27 g s −1 and 1.88 × 10 3 Pa, respectively, and the mean efficiency can be enhanced by 13.4% compared to the MPC with fixed OER.

The wide bandgap of SiC limits these applications and necessitates bandgap tuning toward lower energy for efficient solar absorption. In this regard, the electronic properties of highly stable SiC polytype 6H‐SiC are studied by first‐principles calculations. By varying the Si composition of 6H‐SiC the electronic properties are tailored. The calculated results show that increasing the Si composition of 6H‐SiC from 50% to 66.66% reduces the bandgap from 2.98 to 1.54 eV. It is observed that this reduction in bandgap occurs due to the addition of extra Si s/p orbitals which close the conduction band and valance band. From the electronic conductivity calculations, it is found that with increasing Si composition of 6H‐SiC the conductivity is improved due to higher hole density which can be verified by the spectrum peaks shifted toward near‐infrared and visible region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rational development of organic electronic devices can greatly benefit from a molecular‐level description, where an accurate description of the Coulombic interactions among charge carriers holds paramount importance. However, the molecular‐level organic field‐effect transistor (OFET) simulations do not fully include the short‐range charge‐carrier Coulombic interactions, thus limiting their accuracy. Here, an efficient solution is demonstrated to the 3D Poisson's equation with mixed boundary conditions, optimized for integration into the simulations of organic electronic devices. It leverages the finite difference method for discretization, the Krylov subspace iterative methods for solving the linear system, the algebraic multigrid algorithm for preconditioning, and OpenMP and CUDA parallelization for acceleration. For the organic field‐effect transistors of micrometer sizes or smaller dimensions, obtaining the electric potential within the device takes less than 0.1 s, which is sufficiently efficient for molecular‐level modeling. As a result, both short‐ and long‐range electrostatic interactions are successfully incorporated in the molecular‐level modeling of OFET devices. This integration significantly enhances the robustness of OFET modeling for future applications.",

These devices are widely implemented in numerous applications such as wearable technology, structural health monitoring, and renewable energy systems. In this work, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates arbitrary metastructures into the substrate layer of cantilever beam‐based PEHs is presented. The corresponding performance of each PEH design is evaluated via an experimentally validated finite element model. This is the first systematic study to explore 3D metastructures with various unit cell configurations, unit cell numbers, and porosity levels. Compared with the existing PEH designs, implementation of a 3D auxetic metastructure with 85% porosity single unit cell design can demonstrate a substantial enhancement in output power, reaching 48.16 mW, and a high normalized power density (NPD) of 2.1131 µW mm −3 g −2 Hz −1 . Results show that there are competing requirements for improving the performance of PEHs. On one hand, low metastructure stiffness is preferred to achieve high power output at low resonant frequency. On the other hand, metastructures designs with low stiffness may induce excessive distortion in the substrate layer, leading to mechanical energy loss. This deformation mechanism adversely affects the mechanical to electrical energy conversion efficiency. Detailed guidelines for designing and manufacturing high‐performance PEHs are discussed in this work.",

The result shows that high adsorption energies for indole are obtained at the deprotonated μ 3 ‐O, followed by unsaturated Zr‐cation sites in defective UiO‐66 structures. The key interactions are the hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen donor NH group of indole with the negative charge oxygen atom of the induced μ 3 ‐O site and the dative covalent bond between the nitrogen atom of indole with the unsaturated Zr‐cation. For hydrogen bonding, the binding energies tend to increase with the increasing of defect concentrations and spread a broad range up to ≈−2.00 eV. It is also shown that the vibrational modes of indole molecules are influenced by their adsorption sites. Accordingly, the NH stretching modes of the adsorbed indole are redshifted ≈100–300 cm −1 compared to its counterpart in the isolated indole. The strongest redshift is obtained for indole adsorbed at the μ 3 ‐O site with three missing linkers. The occupation of water at the active sites may enhance or diminish the adsorption affinity of indole relying on the hydrogen bonding mechanism.",

However, it exists in a neutral state as Bn_C2, Bn_C15, and Bn_C17 by losing an H + from one of its carboxylic acids. Density functional theory (DFT) and Time‐dependent density functional theory (TD‐DFT) studies evaluate the efficiency of each betanin form and pinpoint the most probable anchoring point to TiO 2 . The Bn_C17 variant stands out as a highly promising candidate for DSSC cells, demonstrating a distinctive combination of electron injection efficiency, electrochemical performance, hole transport capabilities, and photovoltaic behavior. Considering factors like adsorption energy, binding mode, structural compatibility, electronic properties, and absorption characteristics, Bn_C17@TiO 2 emerges as the most favorable dye@TiO 2 complex among the studied betanin forms for DSSC applications. Contrastingly, the C2‐COOH anchoring point presents challenges with monodentate binding, a different orientation, and potential load distribution issues. This behavior, resembling that of a p‐type dye, differs from the n‐type behavior exhibited by the C15‐COOH and C17‐COOH forms, making the latter two more suitable as sensitizers. Consequently, C2‐COOH may not be the optimal anchoring point for TiO 2 in the investigated betanin forms, especially when compared to the more favorable C17‐COOH anchoring point.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tackling imbalanced problems encountered in real‐world applications poses a challenge at present. Oversampling is a widely useful method for imbalanced tabular data. However, most traditional oversampling methods generate samples by interpolation of minority (positive) class, failing to entirely capture the probability density distribution of the original data. In this paper, a novel oversampling method is presented based on generative adversarial network (GAN) with the originality of introducing three strategies to enhance the distribution of the positive class, called GAN‐E. The first strategy is to inject prior knowledge of positive class into the latent space of GAN, improving sample emulation. The second strategy is to inject random noise containing this prior knowledge into both original and generated positive samples to stretch the learning space of the discriminator of GAN. The third one is to use multiple GANs to learn comprehensive probability distributions of positive class based on multi‐scale data to eliminate the influence of GAN on generating aggregate samples. The experimental results and statistical tests obtained on 18 commonly used imbalanced datasets show that the proposed method comes with a better performance in terms of G‐mean, F‐measure, AUC and accuracy than 14 other rebalanced methods.",

The results indicate that for the set of selected BNFLs, their k r and values are found to be within the ranges 5.139–5.738 mdyn Å −1 and 0.645–1.217 TPa respectively. The behavior of the mechanical properties of BNFLs shows that k r values increase for larger BNFLs, whereas the predicted values increase with decreased BNFL diameters. It is notable to find that some values for these properties are found with magnitudes greater than those reported for some carbon nanostructures. The k r and values predicted by DFT can be used as an input for structural models to describe the elastic behavior of BNFLs, contributing to the understanding of the mechanical properties of BNFLs and potentiating their applications in various areas of nanotechnology.",

Various functional group substitutions on the core (fluorine, ethyl, and cyano groups) and end groups (fluorine) of NFA are introduced to elucidate the influence of chemical modifications on photodegradation pathways. The findings reveal that the core substitution can effectively suppress electrocyclization and 1,5‐sigmatropic shift reactions, which are major contributors to photodegradation. Furthermore, the electronic, excited‐state, and charge transport properties of pristine and degraded products are studied to gain insights into the impact of degradation on photovoltaic parameters. The results suggest that photodegradation leads to the formation of shallow energy trap states, hindering charge transport and increasing charge recombination, ultimately affecting the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). The study not only provides a comprehensive understanding of photodegradation mechanisms but also offers valuable molecular design strategies to enhance the stability of NFAs for future large‐scale applications of OSCs. By establishing a clear connection between the chemical structure and photostability of NFA, this research represents a pivotal contribution to the field of organic electronics and sustainable energy technologies.",

Utilizing first‐principles calculations, the stability, electronic, transport, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties of the TeMoZAZ' monolayers are investigated.

The proposed approach combines numerical simulation with a nonlinear filter. Initially, a dedicated hydrodynamic model for the deployment and retrieval of the mining vehicle is constructed. The identification process commences with simulations based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This approach utilizes CFD to simulate the motion of the deep‐sea mining vehicle during deployment and retrieval, employing an implicit solution approach to analyze its motion in Heave and Yaw degrees of freedom under periodic external forces. Consequently, this provides hydrodynamic performance data. Subsequently, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) estimator is applied to optimally solve an augmented matrix that incorporates both motion data and hydrodynamic parameters, yielding numerical values for the hydrodynamic parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to motion performance obtained by the CFD method, the hydrodynamic model derived from UKF enables an effective prediction of the motion of the deep‐sea mining vehicle, with prediction errors consistently below 6%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic degenerative disorder, is influenced by poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase‐1 (PARP‐1) since its activation is a prerequisite in dopaminergic neuronal cell death. The biocompatible agmatine‐salicylate ionic liquid (i.e., [Agm][Sal 2 ] IL) has shown promising anticancer and non‐cytotoxic characteristics. The stability of the complexes is inferred to be significantly influenced by the water‐mediated hydrogen bonding (H‐bonding) interactions of cations and anions with aromatic amino acids in the presence and absence of water molecules, as established by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the [Agm] 2+ and [Sal] − ions. To identify the structural stability of PARP‐1 in an IL medium, a series of concentrations (mole fraction 0.20–1.00) of ILs with PARP‐1 using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are studied for 200 ns. While the oxygen atoms in the ─COO − group of [Sal] − anions established strong H‐bonding interactions with the water molecules, the dicationic [Agm] 2+ cations formed H‐bonding interactions with the residues of PARP‐1. It is concluded through various analyses that PARP‐1 maintains its structural stability at 0.60–0.80 mole fractions of ILs in an aqueous medium. Thus, this finding signifies [Agm][Sal 2 ] IL as an efficient PARP‐1 stabilizer; with further in vitro studies this IL can aid in the treatments for PD.",

Precise prediction of methane concentrations is therefore of paramount importance. Owing to the complex interplay of factors affecting methane levels, existing forecasting methodologies often fall short in terms of accuracy and long‐term applicability. In response, this article leverages a multiscale time series to propose an attention‐based deep learning model. This approach synthesizes data across varied time spans, enhancing the extraction of periodic patterns and inter‐scale feature correlations. The model employs a hybrid framework and attention mechanisms to adaptively discern both short‐ and long‐term dependencies, as well as spatiotemporal correlations, capturing the intricate coupling of change mechanisms in the environment. Focusing on the Yanqing district of Beijing, a dataset integrating multiple features is developed and conduct forecasts 48 h in advance for both surface methane concentrations and the average molar fraction of total methane columns, comparing our model against several benchmarks. The model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an RMSE of 5.6123, MAE of 3.4959, and an R 2 of 0.9148, which significantly exceeded the accuracy and generalizability of all baseline models.",

The metallic nature of BPO itself is debated in the literature. A previous combinatorial experimental and theoretical study had claimed octahedral rotations as the reason for metallicity. On the contrary, a recent theoretical study has attributed the octahedral distortions for the gapped behavior. Motivated by these conflicting conclusions, the electronic structure of these two compounds is probed within the framework of density functional theory. It is shown that B2PO has a larger semi conducting gap of 1.4 eV compared to BPO, eventhough there are no octahedral distortions. Using maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) calculations, it is divulged that the reduction of Pb‐O covalency is the key to opening of bandgap in these systems. It is shown that the cubic phase of BPO is metallic and that the covalency is reduced by the octahedral rotations in non‐cubic phases leading to the opening of pseudo‐gap. Whereas in B2PO the confinement of covalency to 2D layers leads to a semi‐conducting behavior.",

To elucidate the behavior of AFPs, a series of simulations are conducted using Tenebrio molitor antifreeze protein ( Tm AFP) as a paradigm protein. This review highlights important findings obtained from those studies. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations illustrate that, in order to get adsorbed on to the ice surfaces, a very specific kind of hydration structure and dynamics are developed on the ice‐binding surface (IBS) of Tm AFP. The complementary arrangement of water molecules and protein residues in the ice‐bound state of the protein is determined from heterogeneous ice nucleation simulation on a model IBS. The result shows that the regular structure of ice is not maintained at the protein‐ice interface. Water molecules are found to form five‐membered hydrogen‐bonded rings with protein residues. It is further demonstrated that Tm AFP carries its own binding motif while it is present freely in solution. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions together contribute to form such motif on the IBS of the protein. Further, the growth of ice in presence of the protein bound to an ice plane is found to be inhibited by the Kelvin effect.",

Introducing their 2D counterparts may provide a remedy to these stability issues, as hydrophobic bulky organic cations can resist direct contact of [ sheets with moisture in the air. In addition to air and water stability, 2D perovskites offer tunable optoelectronic properties through structural modulation, similar to their 3D counterparts. In this study, six different transition metal (TM)‐based 2D hybrid halide perovskites are designed: , , , , , and as alternatives for Pb‐based perovskites. Analysis of structural and thermodynamic parameters demonstrate that these designed perovskite materials can form structurally and thermodynamically stable compounds. Additionally, optical properties analysis reveals that the intended compounds exhibit absorption maxima in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Among the designed compounds, shows a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.63%. Thus, these designed 2D perovskite materials hold potential as substitutes for conventional 3D materials in photovoltaic applications.",

For this, hexagonal sinusoidal textures with 750 nm period and aspect ratios (height‐to‐period) of 27% (moderate) and 54% (pronounced) are considered. The optical simulations are performed with the finite element method and an algorithm to correct for the thick glass superstrate. The complex refractive index data of the wide‐bandgap (WBG) and narrow‐bandgap (NBG) perovskites with spectroscopic ellipsometry is determined. Texturing between the glass superstrate and the WBG perovskite top cell has an antireflective effect across the whole wavelength region. In contrast, texturing between the WBG perovskite top cell and the NBG perovskite bottom cell has no additional effect for a moderate texture but leads to light trapping in the NBG perovskite for a pronounced texture. Moderate texturing between the NBG perovskite absorber and the metal back contact leads to light trapping in the NBG perovskite but also excites surface plasmons in the copper back contact. Dielectric interlayers between the NBG perovskite and the metal back contact can reduce the plasmonic absorption losses. Texturing potentially allows to increase the current‐matched short‐circuit current density beyond 17 mA .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Currently, low‐bandgap Mott‐insulating materials are the most promising buffer layers (BLs) for solar power conversion efficiency, unlike organic‐halide or lead‐containing perovskite materials. They can reduce interfacial recombination by field effect passivation of heterojunctions while maintaining cost‐effectiveness and high thermal and electrical stability. Moreover, it is expected to obtain a high quantum efficiency due to multiple carrier generation caused by impact ionization from a single incident photon. This study uses the SCAPS‐1D simulator to estimate and improve the efficiency of Cu 2 O‐based solar cells using Mott insulator La 2 CuO 4 (LCO) as a BL in both ideal and non‐ideal conditions. The simulations examine how BL thickness, carrier concentration, and defect density affect device performance. Also, different metal contact work functions and working temperatures are examined to improve cell performance. Considering all optimisation parameters in ideal conditions, Au/Cu 2 O/TiO 2 /Nb: STO solar cell structure without a BL has a PCE of 11.27%, while Au/Cu 2 O/LCO/TiO 2 /Nb: STO has 28.11%. By incorporating non‐idealities, the simulated solar cell can simulate actual conditions. The impact of each non‐ideality is studied in detail. These findings suggest that Mott insulating buffer materials have great potential for creating high‐efficiency photovoltaic (PV) devices, presenting a new avenue for research.",

In the recent years, bulk heterojunction OSC with a non‐fullerene acceptor /polymer acceptor shows significant enhancement in efficiency (≈19%). Efficiency of the polymer acceptor OSCs is much higher than the fullerene derivative‐based acceptors. In this work, OSC simulations are done using D18 donor and Y6 acceptor bulk heterojunction as a photoactive layer. As a first step, validity of the experimental results for ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/PDIN/Ag structure is done. To investigate efficiency, 2,8,15‐trifluoro‐3,9,14‐tris(heptylsulfonyl)diquinoxalino[2,3‐a:2′,3′‐c]phenazine (HATNASO2C7‐Cs) electron transport layer is validated in place of PDIN in the following device structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/HATNASO2C7‐Cs/Ag. Energy level matching of the HATNASO2C7‐Cs is well aligned compared with PDIN at the cathode interface. Device simulation optimization are carried out for various photoactive layer, ETL and HTL condition. Highest efficiency of 20.99% is obtained for ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/HATNASO2C7‐Cs/Ag when the HATNASO2C7‐Cs thickness, bandgap, electron affinity, carrier mobility, and defect density is matched for ≈30 nm, ≈2.8 eV, ≈4.16 eV, ≈2 × 10 −3 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , and 10 14 cm −3 respectively.

The proposed model is applied to Algeria by estimating its parameters using recent health data (from 2000). The results revealed that the disease‐free equilibrium is stable only when the basic reproduction number is less than one, indicating that controlling the spread of malaria and possibly eradicating it can be achieved by implementing appropriate preventive measures. Simulations also demonstrated a direct correlation between the rate of infection transmission and an increase in the number of infected individuals, highlighting the need for swift action when signs of an outbreak emerge. Based on these findings, a set of preventive measures is recommended, including insecticide spraying programs, widespread distribution of insecticide‐treated bed nets, and implementation of effective treatment protocols for infected individuals. This study also emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring of health data and updating model parameters to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerous natural and technological phenomena are governed by resonances. In nanophotonics, resonances often result from the interaction of several optical elements. Controlling these resonances is an excellent opportunity to provide light with properties on demand for applications ranging from sensing to quantum technologies. The inverse design of large, distributed resonators, however, is typically challenged by high computational costs when discretizing the entire system in space. Here, this limitation is overcome by harnessing prior knowledge about the individual scatterers that form the resonator and their interaction. In particular, a transition matrix multi‐scattering framework is coupled with the state‐of‐the‐art adaptive Antoulas–Anderson (AAA) algorithm to identify complex poles of the optical response function. A sample refinement strategy suitable for accurately locating a large number of poles is introduced. The AAA algorithm is tied into an automatic differentiation framework to efficiently differentiate multi‐scattering resonance calculations. The resulting resonance solver allows for efficient gradient‐based optimization, demonstrated here by the inverse design of an integrated exciton‐polariton cavity. This contribution serves as an important step towards efficient resonance calculations in a variety of multi‐scattering scenarios, such as inclusions in stratified media, periodic lattices, and scatterers with arbitrary shapes.",

Metamaterials have a distinctive ability to boost and redistribute magnetic fields inside the subject undergoing scan when integrated as accessories between receive arrays and the subject. However, the translation of most reported metamaterials into a clinical accessory is still limited and challenging due to their low sensitivity, sub‐optimal performance, and bulky footprints for integration inside MRI scanners. Herein, a metamaterial‐inspired structure is developed using coupled octa‐spiral resonators to boost magnetic field localization inside the scanned region. In addition, the high‐Q resonance of the metamaterial‐inspired structure improves impedance matching and enhances the transmit/receive efficiency of MRI coils. Theoretical analysis of electromagnetic responses and full‐wave simulations show a homogeneous boost in SNR by over times throughout a human‐properties mimicking phantom using the resonator with a maximum SNR enhancement factor (EF) of . The spatial distribution of SNR EF inside the phantom is also validated by preliminary laboratory experiments. Thus, the developed coupled octa‐spirals resonator can pave the way for developing and adopting metamaterial‐inspired devices as clinical accessories for facilitating better, faster, and cost‐effective MRI scans.",

This 2D material is metallized under effects of single Si vacancy, single S vacancy, and pair Si─S vacancies. In the latter case, significant magnetism with a total magnetic moment of 1.55 is produced mainly by S atoms around the vacancy sites. The monolayer metallization takes place also when doping with P and As atoms at Si sublattice, preserving the nonmagnetic nature. Meanwhile, P and As substitution leads to the emergence of magnetism with total magnetic moments of 0.93 and 0.99 , respectively. Herein, magnetic properties are produced mainly by the outermost orbital of pnictogen impurities. Interestingly, the results assert the emergence of the half‐metallicity, which gives evidence of new highly spin‐polarized 2D materials. Further, doping with pair P/P, As/As, and P/As atoms are also considered with different doping configurations. It is found that the nonmagnetic semiconductor nature is preserved upon doping with pair pnictogen atoms, however, the indirect‐to‐direct gap transition is induced.

    "abstract": "Abstract Photonic crystals (PtCs) can confine and guide electromagnetic waves within specific frequency ranges, forming the foundation for promising optical applications. To numerically design PtCs with broad bandgaps, materials with high dielectric constants are favored. However, fabricating these high dielectric constant materials into microstructures is extremely challenging and it suffers from limitation of low fabricating resolution. To address this problem, this paper proposes hybrid microstructures composed of an easy‐to‐fabricate core and a high dielectric constant coating layer, which leverages the strength of both materials. This paper establishes a topology optimization algorithm to generate these PtCs with maximized bandgaps. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating optimized unit cells for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes. The hybrid PtCs offer unprecedented opportunities for the fabrication of optical devices, encouraging further research on multimaterial optical systems and advanced optimization methods to explore photonic bandgap materials beyond those offered by the current photonic technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Physics‐informed neural networks (PINNs) have successfully addressed various computational physics problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs). However, while tackling issues related to irregularities like singularities and oscillations, trained solutions usually suffer low accuracy. In addition, most current works only offer the trained solution for predetermined input parameters. If any change occurs in input parameters, transfer learning or retraining is required, and traditional numerical techniques also need recomputation. In this work, a physics‐driven GraphSAGE approach (PD‐GraphSAGE) based on the Galerkin method and piecewise polynomial nodal basis functions is presented to solve computational problems governed by irregular PDEs and to develop parametric PDE surrogate models. This approach employs graph representations of physical domains, thereby reducing the demands for evaluated points due to local refinement. A distance‐related edge feature and a feature mapping strategy are devised to help training and convergence for singularity and oscillation situations, respectively. The merits of the proposed method are demonstrated through a couple of cases. Moreover, the robust PDE surrogate model for heat conduction problems parameterized by the Gaussian random field source is successfully established, which not only provides the solution accurately but is several times faster than the finite element method in the experiments.",

A comparative analysis is performed using both the original detailed balance model (ODBM) and the modified detailed balance model (MDBM). The main focus of the research is to investigate the effects of excitonic and biexcitonic effective gap energies, as well as the biexciton bound state, on the PCE in the presence of multiple exciton generation (MEG). Calculations using both ODBM and MDBM indicate that the distinct excitonic and biexcitonic effective bandgap energies, resulting from strong confinement effects in quantum dot (QD) structures, significantly affect the PCE in the presence of MEG. In addition, MDBM calculations considering the biexciton bound state show that this bound state critically affects the PCE. The discrepancy between the theoretically predicted maximum PCE and the considerably lower PCE observed in practical applications of QDSCs is also examined, along with the potential reasons for this phenomenon.",

The results show that the lateral temperature distribution within the PV module depends on the module inclination angle and may be highly inhomogeneous, with a temperature difference of ≈5 °C between its warmest and coolest solar cells. Furthermore, It is demonstrated that wind plays a crucial role in determining the operating temperature of PV devices. Specifically, it is shown that forced convection has an even more significant positive effect at higher wind speeds and larger PV module dimensions since the transformation of laminar to turbulent wind contributes to additional cooling. Finally, the power losses associated with the lateral temperature variations across the PV module are analyzed. The results show that the effect of temperature inhomogeneity plays a negligible role in the performance of standard single‐junction silicon PV modules due to a very small temperature coefficient of the solar cell short‐circuit current.",

Its popularity stems from the interesting properties of the monolayer phase, which can serve as the fundamental block for numerous applications. In this paper, an atomistic perspective on the modulation of thermal transport properties in monolayer through strategic defect engineering, specifically the introduction of sulfur vacancies is proposed. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, how various distributions of sulfur vacancies (ranging from random to periodically arranged configurations) affect its thermal conductivity is shown. Notably, it is observed that certain periodic arrangements restore the thermal conductivity of the pristine system, due to a minimized interaction between acoustic and optical phonons facilitated by the imposed superperiodicity. This research deepens the understanding of phononic heat transport in two‐dimensional (2D) materials and introduces a different point‐of‐view for phonon engineering in nanoscale devices, offering a pathway to enhance device performance and longevity through tailored thermal management strategies.",

Results indicate that the heterojunction exhibits excellent selection toward S‐series gas molecules (H 2 S, SO 2 , and SO 3 ), particularly SO 3 . The adsorption energy is determined to be −3.67 eV. Then, the adsorption properties of the heterojunction are further improved by noble metal (Ag, Au, and Pt) modification. Noble metal atoms alter the surface potential energy of the heterojunction, resulting in stronger adsorption activity. For instance, the binding energies of noble metals in the Ag‐MoS 2 /WS 2 , Au‐MoS 2 /WS 2 , and Pt‐MoS 2 /WS 2 systems are −1.03, −1.04, and −2.76 eV, respectively. Additionally, there has been a significant alteration in their bandgaps. Notably, the bandgap of Pt‐MoS 2 /WS 2 has decreased to 1.42 eV (24.16%), which is the most pronounced change. Then, the charge density difference and density of states of noble metal‐modified MoS 2 /WS 2 heterojunction adsorbed SO 3 are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the adsorption capacity of a noble metal‐modified system for SO 3 is enhanced. Finally, raising the temperature can accelerate gas molecule desorption from the system. Combining all calculation results, Ag‐MoS 2 /WS 2 in‐plane heterojunction can be used as a candidate gas‐sensitive material for detecting SO 3 at room temperature (300 K). The Pt‐MoS 2 /WS 2 in‐plane heterojunction is demonstrated to possess effective adsorbent properties for trapping SO 3 gas molecules at room temperature.

The effect of the energy‐absorbing rockbolt is analyzed based on a self‐developed numerical simulation program, and a study is conducted on the influence of five factors such as the energy‐absorption starting axial force, ultimate yielding distance on the supporting effect. The results show that: 1) Compared to conventional rockbolts, the energy‐absorbing rockbolts maintain a intact support system and continuously providing support resistance within 75 d of calculation. 2) Energy‐absorbing rockbolts significantly increase the maximum and minimum principal stresses of the roadway. The increase in maximum principal stress significantly enhances the range of the bearing arch in the surrounding rock. Energy‐absorbing rockbolts have a high capacity to compensate for radial stresses unloaded. 3) The greater the energy‐absorption starting axial force, the more significant the compensation effect of the rockbolts on the radial stress. Appropriately increasing the ultimate yielding distance and rockbolt length can effectively prevent rockbolt failure and control the area of plastic zone.",

The models consider physiological factors, such as surrounding fat tissues, vascularization, and fluids, and are developed to match rodent experiments with a scale‐up to human scale organs.

The externally attached heat sources prove more effective at achieving therapeutic temperatures with minimal invasiveness, particularly in hollow organs. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate the importance of heat source volume and density for uniform temperature distribution and reduced tissue damage. Human‐scale models demonstrate the heat source and stimulation duration required for hyperthermia in organs.

The method of choice to calculate critical points in the phase diagram is a finite‐size scaling analysis, based on a sequence of simulations with widely different system sizes. Modern, massively parallel hardware facilitates that instead cubic sub‐systems of one large simulation are used. Here, this alternative is applied to a symmetric binary liquid at critical composition and different routes to the critical temperature are compared: 1) fitting critical divergences of the composition structure factor, 2) scaling of fluctuations in sub‐volumes, and 3) applying the cumulant intersection criterion to sub‐systems. For the last route, two difficulties arise: sub‐volumes are open systems, for which no precise estimate of the critical Binder cumulant is available. Second, the boundaries of the simulation box interfere with the sub‐volumes, which is resolved here by a two‐parameter finite‐size scaling. The implied modification to the data analysis restores the common intersection point, yielding , universal for cubic Ising‐like systems with free boundaries. Confluent corrections to scaling, which arise for small sub‐system sizes, are quantified and the data are compatible with the universal correction exponent .",

However, lack of proper electronic description of the MM environment can result in electron density leakage from the QM to the MM region, an effect known as electron spill-out (ESO). ESO can be avoided by applying effective core potentials (ECPs) on MM atoms in PE (PE-ECP) or by including repulsion operators to model the orthogonality between the two regions, as in the polarizable density embedding (PDE) approach. In this study, the one- and two-photon absorptions of 4′-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen in complex with DNA and in aqueous solution are investigated. The effect of the missing non-electrostatic repulsion of the MM region on result accuracy is showcased. While ESO errors are not readily visible for one-photon absorption spectra, they become significant when computing two-photon absorption, as more than one excited state is considered. Including ECPs on environment atoms sufficiently addresses the ESO problem, yielding correct structure for excited states.

It will hence be pertinent to fathom the myriad aspect of inelastic charge transport and nanoscale thermoelectricity in single‐molecule junctions. It is examined from first‐principles, achiral and chiral quasi‐1D electrodes to understand the role of junction heterogeneity in overall thermoelectric behavior during charge transport. This calculated inelastic electron tunneling spectra exhibit intense peaks in the low‐frequency regime (&lt; 25 meV) with characteristic bending and rocking modes, which auger well with the available measured data. It is subsequently found that the thermopower can be as high as 212 µV K −1 for σ‐saturated molecular moieties, depending strongly on the configuration of electrodes. Besides, a majority of such single‐molecule junctions turn out to deviate from the Wiedemann–Franz law, leading to anomalies in the electronic thermal conductance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrathin solar cells can be a path forward to low‐cost photovoltaics due to their reduced material consumption and shorter required deposition times. With excellent surface passivation, such devices may feature higher open‐circuit voltages ( V OC ). However, their short‐circuit current density ( J SC ) may be reduced due to decreased light absorption. This mandates implementation of efficient light‐trapping structures. To design efficient ultrathin solar cells that combine surface‐passivation and light‐trapping features, accurate 3‐D modeling is necessary. To this end, a novel 3‐D optoelectrical finite‐element model is developed to analyze the performance of ultrathin solar cells. The model is applied to the case of ultrathin (&lt;500 nm) chalcogenide solar cells (copper indium gallium (di) selenide, CIGSe), rear‐passivated with nanostructured Al 2 O 3 to circumvent optical and electrical losses. It is found that such a nanopatterned dielectric passivation scheme enhances broadband light‐trapping with reduced rear‐surface recombination, resulting in an absolute power conversion efficiency enhancement of 3.9%, compared to cells without passivation structure. Overall, the work shows how 3‐D finite element modeling can aid in analyzing and developing new optical and electrical solar cell designs for ultrathin solar cells such as those based on chalcogenides and perovskites.",

However, this is challenging because of the nonlinearity of data and the uncertainty between data relationships. This paper proposes a combinatorial model based on an improved adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimization (ADPSO) algorithm to optimize a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) neural network to predict AQI time series and capture data dependence. The ADPSO method incorporates a dynamic spatial search strategy into the standard particle swarm optimization method, allowing the parameters to be dynamically adjusted to balance global and local search capabilities, thus improving the performance and effectiveness of this optimization process. Compared to the BiGRU model, the PSO‐BiGRU model, and the radial basis neural,the results of the improved algorithm reveal that the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the ADPSO‐BiGRU predicted air pollution index are smaller than the errors of the other three models. The accuracy of the ADPSO‐BiGRU prediction model is higher than that of the other models, and it aids in the development of effective regional air quality management policies to reduce the negative impacts of pollution.",

For this, ANNs with two recognition schemes are constructed. The first one is designed to recognize ensembles of dielectric scatterers. The second ANN model recognizes the dimensions of gold nanospheres in a mixture and the refractive index of a matrix. A challenge in the first scheme arises at and near the invisibility point, i.e., when the refractive index of nanoparticles is close to that of the medium. Of course, particle recognition in this regime faces fundamental physical limitations. However, such recognition near the invisibility point is possible, and this study reveals its unique properties. Interestingly, the recognition process for the refractive index in the vicinity of the invisibility point shows very small errors. In contrast, the errors for recognition of the radius grow strongly near this point. Another regime with limited recognition occurs when the extinction spectra are not unique and can correspond to different realizations of nanoparticle mixtures. The recognition schemes proposed and investigated herein can find their applications in sensing.",

SymPhas delivers two novel program capabilities: 1) User specification of models from the associated dynamical equations in an unconstrained form and 2) extensive support for integrating user‐developed discrete‐grid‐based numerical solvers into the API. The capability to specify general phase‐field models is primarily achieved by developing a novel symbolic algebra functionality that can formulate mathematical expressions at compile time; is able to apply rules of symbolic algebra such as distribution, factoring, and automatic simplification; and support user‐driven expression tree manipulation. A modular design based on the C++ template meta‐programming paradigm is applied to the symbolic algebra library and general API implementation to minimize application runtime and increase the accessibility of the API for third party development. SymPhas is written in C/C++ and emphasizes high‐performance capabilities via parallelization with OpenMP and the C++ standard library. SymPhas is equipped with a forward Euler solver and a semi‐implicit Fourier spectral solver. Sample implementations and simulations of several phase‐field models are presented, generated using the semi‐implicit Fourier spectral solver.",

The interface difference scheme of the two‐dielectric model is first derived to achieve a smooth extension of the electrostatic potential values and it is verified that it has a second‐order convergence order. In addition, it is displayed that the local iteration method greatly accelerates the efficiency of calculating the electrostatic interaction forces. However, it is found that the computational efficiency improvement of the traditional local iteration is less significant (about three times) for polymer simulations such as 3D diagonal type. Therefore, a new strategy, the banded local iteration method, is proposed and the simulation results demonstrate that it can better adapt the effects of the deformation of the polymer during its motion, where the computational efficiency is increased by 29 times at most, while the relative error is controlled to less than 5.15e−4. The work can be helpful for accelerating the solution of electrostatic forces under dielectric inhomogeneity, and confer new insights into the optimization of iteration for polymer chains with different geometries in large electrostatic systems.",

In addition, the method is coupled to the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation, describing the dynamics of the magnetic nanocrystals within the macrospin approximation. The binding of multivalent analytes to the recognition ligands of the nanoparticles leads to the formation of clusters of magnetic nanoparticles, which in turn drastically changes the macroscopic magnetic response of the solution.

The results demonstrate that when the bogie has a rear WDD, lateral displacement (LaD) of the front wheelset is the smallest. When the bogie has an anti‐phase WDD, LaD of the rear wheelset is the smallest, while when the bogie has an in‐phase WDD, LaD of the front and rear wheelsets is the largest, and LaD of the front and rear WDD is between the two, which is in line with the theoretical analysis results. Compared with LaD results of the wheelset bearing outer raceway under normal conditions, when the wheel has a diameter difference, LaD distance of the outer race increases with the WDD increasing, and the frequency of lateral movement also increases with the increase against the WDD gradation. The high‐frequency and large‐distance lateral movement of the wheelset bearing outer race under the WDD will increase the roller‐outer raceway force, and accelerate the failure of the bearing.",

All these features sparked numerous efforts to insert GNRs in nanoelectronics. As a result, synthesis routes with atomic resolution are now a reality. Recently, the rise of heterojunction (HJ) engineering pushed even further the prospects, allowing the blending of different GNRs as building blocks. However, much of the potential behind it remains untouched for some junctions. In this work, the consequences of forming a cove‐type GNR (CGNR) HJ by assembling specimens with borders of different zig‐zag/armchair ratios are explored. The nanoribbons are simulated using the extended two‐dimensional Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model with electron–phonon coupling. The findings show that manipulating the junction creates multiple routes for smooth monotonic gap tuning. Moreover, the changes in the hopping mechanism, mobility, and effective mass are reported leading to variations up to 10 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and 0.425 m e . This work reveals a pathway to expand the modularity of CGNRs through smooth control of the charge carrier's properties. Future applications can explore this feature to design devices with highly specific charge transport characteristics. The study also serves as theoretical background, potentially inspiring new tuning strategies in other GNRs.",

The impact of end group units on geometric, electronic, and excited state properties of NFAs is studied using state‐of‐the‐art density functional theory methods. Various selection criteria are used to screen potential NFAs among 18 newly designed NFAs. The interfacial electronic properties between conjugated polymer and NFAs are thoroughly studied in the excited state to analyze the potentiality of screened NFAs. More importantly, the screened asymmetric NFAs have shown improved charge mobilities with a lower charge recombination rate than prototype FRY6. It is noticed that screened NFAs have multiple charge transfer pathways through direct excitation, hot excitons, and intermolecular electric field mechanisms. Overall, the results obtained from this computational study give useful guidance for developing NFAs for high‐performance OSCs.",

Second, n‐doping levels (between 10 12 and 10 18 cm −3 ) and surface traps densities (between 10 8 and 10 12 cm −2 ) lead to variations of the generated piezopotential of two orders of magnitude.

However, their performance is heavily influenced by the terrain where they are installed. Traditional experimental methods for predicting their performance on different terrains are time‐consuming, so a computational approach is necessary to improve efficiency. To address this, a machine learning‐based approach is proposed using Artificial Neural network (ANN) and Deep neural network (DNN) with the Tanh activation function to predict piezoelectric tile performance in diverse terrains. The models are trained on an experimental dataset consisting of four terrains, including Flat terrain (FT) and Hilly Terrain (HT) 1, 2, 3 with road angles of 0, 3, 6, and 10 degrees. A finite element model is also established to optimize the piezoelectric tile and estimate the suitable parameter range to prevent damage to the tile during experiments. The results indicate that the DNN model performs better than the ANN model, achieving high accuracy in predicting piezoelectric tile performance on different terrains. These findings suggest that machine learning can provide a time and cost‐effective way for predicting the performance of piezoelectric tiles in varied terrains, thereby facilitating betters installation and maintenance decisions for piezoelectric tile systems.",

The sMC approach allows to simulate processes far from equilibrium and obtain information about the dynamic properties of the system under investigation. In the approach proposed, here the probability of accepting the final (trial) state depends on the activation energy, not on the relative energy between the final and initial state. This barrier height is probed on an ongoing basis, by generating intermediate states along the path connecting the initial and trial positions. Importantly, to calculate the activation energy, the model only requires knowledge of the Hamiltonian without having to introduce additional input parameters such as transition rates etc. The details of sMC are explained in the case of a simple spin model. The comparison of its results with the ones obtained within the frame of stochastic Landau‐Lifshitz‐Gilbert indicates the correctness of sMC. In this study's opinion, the proposed method can be applied to simulate other processes, for example, dynamics of classical atoms and complex fluids, diffusion, nucleation, surface adsorption, and crystal growth processes.",

To overcome this limitation, this paper describes a novel method for designing radiation diagrams of leaky‐wave antenna arrays based on the theory of IIR discrete filters. The proposed method relies on the design of discrete filters with the prototypes of analog low‐pass filters defined by Butterworth and Chebyshev type I polynomials, whose roots along with the bilinear transformation provide the location of the poles and the zeros of the discrete LTI system and, therefore, the parameters of the leaky‐wave antenna array. Results with different designs and a comparison with other approaches show the utility and effectiveness of this novel method to design wide‐beam leaky‐wave antenna arrays.",

Proper configuration of sintering kiln parameters directly affects the quality of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 . However, determining optimal working conditions through onsite trials is time‐consuming and expensive. A predictive model for the sintering furnace of ternary cathode material is developed. The predictive model incorporates chemical reactions, thermal conduction inside the saggars, and convective and radiative heat transfer within the furnace. It comprehensively analyzes the relationship between furnace temperature and material temperature. Radiative heat transfer within the furnace is calculated using the Monte Carlo method, and convective heat transfer properties on the surface of the saggars are obtained through computational fluid dynamics simulations. Heat transfer inside the saggars is resolved using the finite difference method. The model accounts for the effects of operational and structural parameters. Onsite experiments validate the accuracy of the model, with a simulation error of &lt;±10% under typical working conditions. Leveraging this model, the effects of loading quantity, moving velocity, and saggar size on the sintering of ternary cathode materials are compared.

Although group lasso regularization has the advantage of inducing group sparsity and handling variable selection issues, it can lead to numerical oscillations and theoretical challenges in calculating the gradient at the origin when employed directly during training. The paper addresses the aforementioned obstacle by invoking a smoothing function to approximate group lasso regularization. On this basis, a gradient‐based neuro fuzzy learning algorithm with smoothing group lasso regularization for the first order Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy system is proposed. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is rigorously proved under gentle conditions. In addition, experimental outcomes acquired on two approximations and two classification simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the algorithm with original group lasso regularization and L 2 regularization in terms of error, pruned neurons, and accuracy. This is particularly evident in significant advancements in pruned neurons due to group sparsity. In comparison to the algorithm with L 2 regularization, the proposed algorithm exhibits improvements of 6.3, 5.3, and 142.6 in pruned neurons during sin function, Gabor function, and Sonar benchmark dataset simulations, respectively.",

The diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and polyetheramine D230 are used as epoxy resin matrix and curing agents, respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract Birefringence, quantified as the maximum effective index difference of two orthogonally polarized modes, is one of the key characteristics of Lithium Niobate on Insulator (LNOI) waveguide devices. As LNOI optical properties strongly depend on the polarization of the propagating light beam, achieving the zero‐birefringence condition (ZBC) is highly desired. In this work, a rib LNOI waveguide is designed, and the influence of geometrical dimensions on the birefringence is characterized. From the result, the slab's height is found to be the dominant geometrical factor that significantly contributes to the birefringence, with an optimum slab's height found at 50 nm. For this optimized value, the influence of width and wavelength on birefringence are characterized. The analysis is extended to investigate the properties of group indices that can result in the temporal walk‐off phenomenon. This phenomenon can significantly impact the performance of single‐photon devices, as it can cause a polarization mismatch between the incident photon and the polarization properties of the medium, resulting in reduced efficiency of devices such as single‐photon detectors. In the analysis, the zero birefringence and walk‐off are achieved at narrow waveguide width, 𝑤 of 250 nm and wavelength, = 1500 nm, which is within the telecommunication region band.",

The mathematical model consists of a six spaced bar‐shaped fiber and a vortex‐control tangential entrance with protuberance radians. The vortex shedding behavior is captured by the digital particle image velocimetry technique. The velocity vectors and vorticity fields are analyzed experimentally. Meanwhile, the turbulent model is established to identify the flow stagnate point/region transformation. Investigation of wall shear stress and surface pressure distributions around circular cylindrical fibers illustrate the mechanism of drag reduction tentatively. Afterward, the novel optimization module produces higher recovery rates of up to 1.56 times as compared to that of a conventional module in equivalent filtration condition. It indicates that by means of a hydrodynamics flow control strategy, the fabricated membrane module structure could potentially improve energy utilization efficiency in filtration processes.",

Trace‐ion accumulation relies on charged nanopores that exclude coions, which gives rise to depletion of the dominant salt and high local electric fields in the region next to the nanopores. Trace ions accumulate in this region because convection carries them toward the nanoporous interface, whereas electromigration in the opposite direction is strongest next to the interface. With monovalent coions having 2% difference in diffusion coefficients, calculated accumulation selectivity factors reach &gt;1.2. Such selectivities may prove useful in separating very similar species such as isotopes or equally charged peptides.",

The result shows that MIC score fits DSW score very well. Moreover, the MIC score significantly correlates with some established biological metrics for miRNA importance, such as miRNA conservation and expression level. Finally, MIC is extended to explore miRNAs with different importance scores across species for evaluating the possibility of druggable miRNAs and estimate how single nucleotide mutants affect the importance of miRNAs.

First, the node voltage sensitivity to PV power is calculated. Next, an optimal power compensation scheme using a new compensation mechanism is obtained so that the node voltage can be acceptably regulated with minimum power curtailment. The maximum tolerable communication delay is also estimated based on PV power mutation during communication delay (CD). Because extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms exhibit fast and precise prediction, they can be used here to predict PV power. Based on the predicted power, the power compensation can be appropriately corrected to achieve effective voltage regulation under abnormal CD (ACD). Finally, the results indicate that voltage deviation can be regulated to an acceptable range of 1.00–1.05 per unit by using the proposed power compensation approach to curtail reactive power or even active power. The maximum PV power error predicted by ELM algorithm is only 2.67%, which is an acceptable basis for power compensation correction under ACD. Hence, by curtailing additional PV power again, the effective voltage regulation can be finally ensured under power mutation with ACD.",

The thiophene‐like functional group proved to be the most energetically stable, followed by the pyrrolic‐ N ‐sulfide. Typically, the sulfurized functional groups pulled out electrons from the ribbon, promoting p‐type doping. Ferromagnetic semiconducting behavior is found in thioketone, pyrrolic‐ N ‐sulfide, thiopyran‐like dioxide, and N ‐thionyl aniline functional groups. Results for the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum energies demonstrate that thiopyran‐like dioxide is energetically favorable to remove spin‐down electrons, whereas thioketone is energetically favorable to catch spin‐down electrons. This fact gives insight into future spin‐dependent electrochemistry studies on functionalized graphite materials. Results for lithium adsorption demonstrate that the donated charge by lithium and interatomic distance between Li and the functional groups are strongly dependent on the nature of the functional group.",

However, the mechanisms behind TADF and solid‐state luminescence are not clear. Recently, two diphenyl sulfone TADF molecules with quite similar structures, A1‐D1 and A2‐D1 , have been observed to demonstrate distinctly diverse photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and inverse solid‐state luminescent properties. In order to understand the origin of this phenomenon, the TADF mechanism of both molecules is studied using density function theory. The results show that strong spin–orbit coupling, low minimum energy cross point, dense triplet energy level distribution, and a mediate locally excited triplet state ( 3 LE) can facilitate the rapidly reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process in A1‐D1 . Moreover, the solid states of both molecules are characterized via the combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method. It is attributed to the compact intermolecular stacking; the nonradiative consumption of A2‐D1 is suppressed substantially by the restricted intermolecular rotation (RIR) effect. Therefore, A2‐D1 with low PLQY can exhibit an aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) phenomenon in neat films. This work may benefit the rational design of nondoped OLEDs.",

In this study, analogous waveform‐selective phenomena using only linear circuits and linear media are reported. Although such linear metasurfaces are analytically and numerically demonstrated to exhibit variable absorption performance, it cannot strictly be categorized as waveform‐selective absorption. It is due to the fact that the waveform‐selective responses in the linear metasurfaces originated from the dispersion behaviors of the structures rather than the frequency conversion seen in nonlinear waveform‐selective metasurfaces. These linear structures are thus referred to as pseudo‐waveform‐selective metasurfaces. Additionally, it is shown that the pseudo‐waveform‐selective metasurfaces have limited performance unless nonlinearity is introduced. These results and findings confirm the advantages of nonlinear waveform‐selective metasurfaces, which can be exploited to provide an additional degree of freedom to address existing electromagnetic problems/challenges involving even waves at the same frequency.",

However, how to make cyclo‐N 5 − complexes stable under ambient condition, without the presence of nonenergetic components, such as H 3 O + and NH 4 + , has always been a challenge. In this work, a fully active nitrogen energetic chain Mg 2 (N 5 ) 2 N 2 [Mg 2 (N 5 ) 2 N 2 ] n (denoted as ANEC n , n ≥ 1) is reported, which has high nitrogen content up to 78%. More importantly, first‐principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations confirm the stability of this structure without external supports. Further electronic structure analysis indicates that the charge transfer from Mg to cyclo‐N 5 − leads to strong covalent bonds, which promotes the stability of cyclo‐N 5 − in the chain structures. This finding can contribute to rational design and synthesis of novel high‐energy density materials.",

    "abstract": "Molecular Simulation is nowadays one of the most powerful tools for investigation of matter. Its results have led to fundamental discoveries with the effect of forging current technology and shaping its future beyond any expectation. From molecular docking[1] to sophisticated materials,[2] simulation can pilot the design of futuristic systems for the most advanced laboratories. However its physical models and numerical techniques need to be continuously upgraded in order to have a constructive interplay with rapidly evolving experimental techniques. Removing barriers between different length and time scales was the desired target at the beginning of the new millennium.[3] The rationale behind this aim lies in the fact that molecular simulation is a quantitative tool that can satisfactorily determine both the microscopic origins of large scale properties and the influence of large scale behavior on the microscopic scale. Only knowledge of the interplay of scales can guide the accurate design of atomic or molecular systems with properties on demand. The program put forward in Ref. [3] has been implemented in many research centers all over the world, with relevant results in several fields of advanced research, from molecular biology,[4] to materials science,[5] to the design of novel “green” substances of high technological impact such as ionic liquids,[6] to cite a few. Current molecular simulation routinely links different scales in space and time. Moreover the idea that the governing physical principles of simulated models should be framed, as much as possible, in a rigorous mathematical language is starting to become a standard procedure for many researchers, with the consequence that simulations are characterized by an increasing physical accuracy and reproducibility.[7] Such conceptual progress is taking place in parallel to what can be considered a true technical revolution in the field, the contribution of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is not only increasing in a substantial manner the numerical efficiency of simulation algorithms but is also contributing to the refinement of atomic and molecular models where the currently available ones do not offer the desired accuracy.[8] However, it should be kept in mind that machine learning approaches, while being more efficient than other numerical approaches, still need well defined physical models. In addition, there is a key question regarding the generalization properties of artificial neural networks, i.e. when and why machine learning algorithms can (or cannot) generalize from the training data. In my view the major challenge for the future consists in finding an optimal balance between the research that develops first principle models and the research that empowers the technical efficiency of machine learning. Finally, in a summary of the general state of art of the field, the progressing path of quantum computers towards performing molecular simulations in an efficient manner cannot be missed.[9] It is not yet the revolution expected,[10] but further progress in the next decade may indeed lead to a significant change of the way we are currently dealing with molecular simulations. Summarizing the concepts above, an ambitious and yet realistic program for the next decade would consist of developing simulation protocols where physical models across different length and time scales are systematically formalized in a rigorous mathematical language and are implemented in efficient numerical schemes according to the most advanced computational technologies. Within the framework of the above overview, this themed issue of Advanced Theory and Simulations presents a collection of state-of-the-art papers in the field. The papers cover a broad spectrum of subjects with the interplay of theoretical models, efficient numerical procedures and actual applications, distributed across a network of different disciplines such as physics, mathematics, chemistry and computer science. The common message of the papers reflects the principles of the ambitious program proposed above with the specific aim of promoting synergies between different subjects and disciplines. The hope is that this collection will represent a reference for newcomers and a concrete example to experienced scientists of a shared platform across subjects and disciplines that traditionally have been separated in the past.",

An emerging interlayer parallel‐to‐antiparallel magnetic transition of the twisted CFO bilayer induced by appropriate piezostrain pulses generated from the PMN‐PT membrane is discovered. Such a strain‐induced parallel‐to‐antiparallel magnetic transition is non‐volatile and reversible, arising from the synergistic interaction among spin, strain, and twisting order parameters.

In membranes with electrically conductive surface, the conductivity can be regulated by varying the surface potential. This work is devoted to the theoretical study of switchable ionic conductivity. The transport of ions is described by the 2D space charge model and 1D uniform potential model taking into account the Stern layer. The conductivity decreases with lowering the Stern layer permittivity due to enhanced screening of electronic surface charge. The growth of surface potential leads to the conductivity enhancement due to accumulation of more counter‐ions inside the nanopore. For nanopores with constant surface charge density, the ionic conductivity follows the bulk electrolyte conductivity at high ion concentrations, and becomes independent of concentration when the latter is low. In contrast, the nanopores with constant surface potential demonstrate a linear decrease of conductivity with lowering the logarithm of ion concentration. The deviation between 1D and 2D models becomes noticeable at higher values of Stern layer permittivity, pore radius, electrolyte concentration, and surface potential. The proposed models are verified by comparison with experimental data on pure water conductivity in charged porous matrix.",

More specifically, the proposed implementation combines the CN approximate factorization splitting procedure with bilinear transformation in the z ‐domain within the CFS‐PML regions. To simulate the unique anisotropic characteristic of the ferrite structure, the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method, which is modified at the integer time step, is introduced during the formulation. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency theoretically and experimentally. According to the results, it can be concluded that the proposed scheme takes full advantage of the approximate CN theory, CFS‐PML formulation, and modified ADE method in terms of the considerable computational accuracy, outstanding absorbing performance, and remarkable efficiency. Moreover, it can be demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can maintain its stability with the dissatisfaction of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition.",

Among the recombination pathways, trap‐mediated recombination due to doping and material processing is often the dominant process. Impedance spectroscopy under illumination is a popular and powerful method to investigate time constants of recombination and reaction. Traditionally, an equivalent circuit is involved in the analysis of impedance spectroscopy, nevertheless, it provides limited direct information about the microscopic quantities related to diffusion, reaction, and recombination. In the present study, a theoretical model for diffusion‐limited photocurrent under small voltage bias and its application for the simplified evaluation of equivalent circuits for impedance analysis are presented. Full numerical simulations of the semiconductor transport equations are used to validate the theoretical model for typical values of carrier lifetime. This combination of theoretical approximations, equivalent circuit models, and full simulations provides an important background for the analysis of recombination and transport properties of photoelectrode materials.",

Employing 2D multilayers as the main plasmonic substrate instead of pure metals is a relatively new concept that can provide advantages for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. In this work, the gain in sensitivity of the Au–Ag based SPR sensors is evaluated by employing 2D materials like graphene, MoS 2 , and WS 2 in a multilayer SPR system. The simulations calculate the sensitivity of such multi‐layered SPR structures and indicate that the use of WS 2 in the modified system can lead to an increased sensitivity (1.53 times) as compared to the standard Au‐based Kretschmann configuration.",

Membrane‐based separation technology provides an economical method to alleviate the current He scarcity. In this study, using a combination of first‐principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, it is theoretically demonstrated that the phosphorus carbide membrane P 2 C 3 possesses high efficiency in He separation from the natural gas (H 2 , N 2 , CO, H 2 O, CO 2 , and CH 4 ) and other noble gas atoms (Ne and Ar). In addition, the He permeance exceeds 10 –4 mol m –2 s –1 Pa –1 over a wide range of temperatures (200–500 K), which is far beyond the industrially acceptable value. Combining the zero‐point‐energy and quantum tunneling effects, the quantum analysis shows that the P 2 C 3 membrane has great potential for 3 He/ 4 He isotope separation, thus providing a combined means for both He and 3 He isotope separation.

These targets include the lattice parameters, cohesive energy, elastic constants, and surface energies as well as the cohesive energy curve, basal plane decohesion energy curve, and generalized stacking fault energy curves for basal, prismatic, pyramidal I, and pyramidal II planes. These interatomic potentials demonstrate excellent reproduction of relevant properties and enable accurate MD simulations of volumetric and plastic deformations, as well as fracture in Mg, Co, and Ti HCP metals.

A molecular model is developed containing ZnO nanowire (NW) aligned vertically on functionalized graphene sheet (FGS) and embedded in the cross‐linked epoxy matrix. The molecular dynamics simulation technique is employed to evaluate the traction‐separation behavior of FGS in both opening and sliding modes. Three different chemical groups of carboxyl (COOH), carbonyl, and hydroxyl with multiple grafting densities are explored as functional groups. The results reveal that the interfacial strength and the cohesive energy are considerably enhanced in the functionalized model compared with the pristine structure. COOH has the most impact on the traction‐separation response with a 112% improvement of interfacial strength. The enhanced effect of functionalization is more intense in the shear separation than the normal one. However, comparing the graphene/ZnO NW with graphene/no ZnO NW structures show that adding ZnO NW can compensate for the slight effect of grafting in the normal direction. The results indicate that combining the growth of ZnO NW and functionalization enhances the interfacial strength up to two‐fold in the opening and up to eight‐fold in the sliding mode of carbon fiber composites.",

The results show that the models have excellent curve fitting ability, and can be used to determine the adsorption relationship and predict the chromatographic elution curves under complex or unknown adsorption mechanism.",

In both systems, the intercalation of RE leads to the dramatic decrease of the magnetic moments of the Ni‐interface atoms and to the negligible moments of C‐atoms in a graphene layer, compared to the parent graphene/Ni(111) system. At the same time, the significant ‐doping of graphene together with a band‐gap opening is observed in both cases of the RE intercalation with a position of the graphene Dirac point reaching eV. Also the large density of states is found in the vicinity of the Fermi level () along the direction for the graphene‐derived states which can be attributed to the joint effect of the intercalated RE and interface Ni atoms. These factors – increased density of states at and absence of magnetism of C‐atoms in a graphene layer – indicate the possibility of the observation of the superconductive state in graphene in the considered RE‐based systems, which is important for the understanding of these and other electronics effects in the graphene‐based systems.",

Delayed Detached‐Eddy Simulation (DDES) approaches in combination with high order (5th) flux discretization WENO (Weighted Essentially Non‐Oscillatory) and Riemann solver are employed. Two variants of the DES length scale calculation methods are compared. The results are validated against experimental data with good accuracy. The studies provide guideline on the mesh and turbulence modeling selection for flatback airfoil simulations. The results indicate that the wake breakdown is strongly influenced by the spanwise resolution of the mesh, which directly contributes to the prediction accuracy especially for drag force and noise emission. The Reynolds normal stress and the Reynolds stress component have the largest contributions on the mixing process, while the contribution of the component is minimal. Proper orthogonal decomposition is further performed to gain deeper insights into the wake characteristics.",

The approach permits computation of compliance current without knowing the geometries of conductive filaments and switching behaviors. This avoids the need to retrain the entire dataset when additional compliance currents are considered and is thus ideal for resistive switching (RS) thin films, doped layers, and other material systems. Computation of compliance current is consistent with experimental data for a wide range of parameters and learning tasks and demonstrates switching behavior not captured by traditional models. Lesion calculations elucidate the brain‐inspired‐modification‐facilitated increase in compliance‐current‐computation‐accuracy. A state‐of‐the‐art performance on challenging compliance‐current learning tasks without storing data is achieved (“brain inspired replay (BIR) – gating based on internal context (Gat)” method, ≈89%; above a benchmark of ≈50% for synaptic‐intelligence (SI)/elastic‐weight‐consolidation (EWC) methods), and it provides a novel model for computing compliance current based on replay of the brain.

It is proposed that the shrinking effect caused by the pocket formation can effectively reduce the surface tension, and specifically, promote the rotation of the CeO 4 units at CeO 4 ‐t‐p surface to further stabilize the edge Ce cations of the units. Such CeO 4 ‐t‐p reconstructed CeO 2 (100) can also act as a promising support for the single metal atoms since the induced shrinking and rotation effects can further promote their adsorption and dispersion.

A holographic grating is achieved through in situ photopolymerization of a highly crosslinked polymer to produce nanostructured refractive index modulation. The unique swelling characteristics DP holographic sensors possess necessitate the development of system‐specific computational modelling. Hydrogel parameters, including film thickness, refractive index change, layer number, and external medium refractive index are examined for their effect on reflection spectra. Optimized computational models are utilized to study the effect of differential swelling rates of individual layer spacings on sensor response, indicating an idealized reduction in a swelling of 50% for the highly crosslinked region.

A clustering method is also used for dividing all compounds into training and external test (ET) sets. Component principal analysis is used to eliminate the redundancy between descriptors. The accuracy and predictability of the proposed models are proven by comparing their key statistical terms. The good results obtained with the internal and external validations (EV) show that the proposed models can predict high‐performance activities and that the selected descriptors are pertinent. This model is also validated using internal validation (IV), mainly using cross‐validation (leave‐many‐out (LMOCV)). The applicability domain (AD) is identified.

Similar to the structure of pressure‐densified a ‐SiO 2 , the Al‐modified a ‐SiO 2 comprises a network of Silicon (Si)‐centered tetrahedra as well as unquenchable pentahedra and, to a smaller extent, hexahedra coordination defects. Al itself acts not only as a network former, with fourfold coordination, but also as a center for fivefold and sixfold coordination defects. Al content promotes densification since it shifts the potential energy minima at densities larger than in their pristine counterpart. Calculations uncover that Young's modulus ( Y ) and static dielectric constants ( ε 0 ) can be effectively doubled through densification. Oxygen starvation promotes network polymerization, which further increases Y and ε 0 . However, the small rings formation through Si─Si bonding and presence of undercoordinated Si introduce electronic states in the electronic band gap. The results provide guidance for the bottom‐up design of amorphous silica with tunable microscopic structure and properties desirable for advancing electronic applications.",

The nanocluster model is used to obtain free energy barriers from DFT calculations, and these are used to build a microkinetic model.

The Monte Carlo method simulates the differences and distribution of independent factors among cells. Temperature‐dependent factors are modeled with empirical formulas. Simulation results show that the main factors affecting SOC consistency are differences in battery temperature, leakage current, and Coulombic efficiency.

Approximations are tested for electron exchange‐correlation (XC) and van der Waals interactions to assess their ability to reproduce experimental adsorption enthalpies of H and O on Pt(111). The vdW‐uncorrected generalized gradient approximation to XC of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) agrees most closely with experiments. Using DFT‐PBE thereafter, it is determined that the O chemisorption enthalpy on this wide range of transition‐metal surfaces is proportional to the sum of first and second atomic ionization energies, akin to a Born–Haber cycle for a redox reaction, indicating that metal redox activity controls O chemisorption strength. Then it is shown that the O and Cl chemisorption enthalpies are strongly correlated, suggesting that the transition metals considered will oxidize unselectively water and Cl – . This strong correlation appears also for crystal reduction potentials of binary oxides and chlorides, indicating a fundamental challenge for future seawater electrode materials design.",

In terms of optical and electrical performance, wedge geometry outperforms planar geometry and shows 17.18% higher efficiency.

    "abstract": "Abstract The penetrating behavior of binder droplets has a substantial effect on the dimensional correctness and strength of the manufactured components. In this article, a physical model and a mathematical model of multiphase flow are created, computationally computed, and experimentally validated to predict the spreading and penetration behavior of multi‐drop binder in a powder bed. The findings indicate: 1) The spreading diameter and penetration depth of the binder increase as the number of droplets grows. However, the size of the rise reduces as the number of droplets grows. 2) The binder is spread symmetrically in the powder bed, with greater saturation in the middle area than margins on both sides, and a higher saturation in the upper region than the lower. 3) Repeated drops of binder in various areas may improve the saturation of the peripheral region while ensuring that the core area is not oversaturated. 4) It is discovered that as the number of ink jet drops rises, the size of the sample grows, and the growth in sample size reduces with the number of ink jet drops. This paper's findings provide light on the mechanics behind light‐cured binder jet additive manufacturing.",

The ground‐state pristine graphene is not catalytically active for benzene hydroxylation, and doping and photocatalysis through excitations are employed to improve the catalyst systems, while both strategies exhibit limited effects. A combination of Be‐doping and photocatalysis through excitations results in encouraging changes, where all energy barriers are moderate, so that the whole catalytic processes proceed facilely at mild conditions. Graphene materials, especially Be‐ and O‐doped ones, are good photocatalysts due to the low excitation energies. Mechanistic studies indicate that the active sites of the excited‐state graphene, whether pristine or doped, are oxygen anion radical (O −• ) and distinct from the epoxide species for the ground state; in addition, Be‐doping pronouncedly reduces the excitation energies and enhances the interactions with the active‐site O species, which further show strong stabilization effects to transition states and reduce substantially the energy barriers.",

Here, the flow control mechanism is theoretically clarified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of graphene‐based nanoscale capillaries. The imbibition rate complies with a modified Lucas–Washburn equation. It changes non‐monotonically with the slit width due to a compromise in competition of density and slip length. Secondly, the relative scale of imbibition and evaporation rate is length dependent. From short slits to long ones, the imbibition–evaporation process alters from evaporation controlled to imbibition controlled. Finally, hydrophilic modification is employed to enhance the rates. External modification can spread the water and accelerate the evaporation. Within the slit, the flow is accelerated by a positive hydrophilic gradient but detained by a negative one. These findings can be applied in a novel nanofluidic diode.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work a novel theoretical and computational method for computing electroweak beta decay spectra of medium and heavy‐mass nuclei, as well as the electronic structure of atomic and molecular systems is developed. In particular, starting from the phenomenological electroweak interaction of the Standard Model (SM) of particles, a general expression of the beta decay rate was derived. Relativistic effects are taken into account by solving the many‐electron Dirac equation from first‐principles. Furthermore, an extension of this approach to include the nucleon‐nucleon interaction at the same level of theory of the electronic correlations has been devised. It is shown that post‐collisional effects, and to a lesser extent the electronic exchange and correlation, can modify significantly the cross‐section only at low energies (&lt;10 keV), while nuclear correlations considerably affect the lineshape of both the absorption and emission spectra particularly in odd‐odd nuclear transitions, where the independent particle approximation, on which the nuclear shell model is framed, is more likely to fail. These findings demonstrate the importance of moving beyond the independent particle picture to obtain an accurate description of the experimental data by adding the many‐body correlations between the spectator and participator hadrons and leptons involved in the decay. The application of our approach to a number of test cases, such as the modeling of beta decay of 36 Cl, 63 Ni, 129 I, 210 Bi, 241 Pu and of the electron capture of 138 La 3 + , leads to an extremely good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Finally, the extension of this method to atomic and molecular systems by calculating the electronic structures of 138 La 3 + and several isomers (MgCN, MgNC) and molecules (HMgCN, MgCNO, and BrCF 3 ) relevant to astrophysical scenarios is presented. This method, which is capable to deal with both nucleonic and electronic degrees of freedom, has far‐reaching implications also in neutrino physics and nuclear astrophysics.",

Thus, the requirement that no atom in the bulk shall experience a force from charges associated with the surface, a requirement formulated in terms of a generalized Tasker condition, leads to an interplay involving transfer of charge between different surfaces for a given sample. Through this mechanism, so‐called polar surfaces, often considered to be essentially unstable, can always be stabilized. Density functional theory slab calculations are carried out to obtain typical surface charges and associated bulk geometric displacements for an individual surface. Then the consequences of the interplay between surfaces are studied through one property that is usually considered a bulk property, namely the polarization / dipole moment per volume, and one property that is usually related to an individual surface, that is, heterogeneous catalytic activity. Model calculations illustrate the importance of charge transfer between surfaces in both cases. These calculations provide a guide for much more difficult ab initio computations that might be carried out in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of 2D materials has resulted in many platforms with promising applications. One possibility is to combine two (or more) systems in a multilayered structure. However, can such materials transition in‐plane? Here, the potential of graded transition from graphene to silicene, via 2D silicon carbide is explored. The work focuses on mechanical performance of a two‐phase gradated system under uniaxial stress. The percentage of the carbon/silicon in‐plane, to explore the resulting effects on strength and stiffness using full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) is varied. Carbon atom placement of 0% to 100% in nine increments with random substitution, is tested using both single‐bond and mixed‐bond homogeneous and two‐phase gradated models. Stiffness and strength can be predicted by a simple model accounting for proportional bond distributions. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of nominal amounts of Si–C bonding results in drastic changes in mechanical response when compared to graphene, tolerant to change across a wide range of distributions, suggesting a “weakest link” effect. For the two‐phase gradated systems, stress contour plots correlate with changes in silicon‐to‐carbon ratios. The work demonstrates the feasibility of a new class of 2D in‐plane gradated materials with tunable stiffness, predictable strength, and controlled failure.",

To this aim, a new set of Lennard‐Jones interacting parameters for the MAF structure with benzene, methanol, ethanol, and 1‐propanol is developed in order to reproduce experimental adsorption. Pure component and binary benzene/alcohol mixtures are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations. The distribution of the molecules inside the structure is studied in terms of radial distribution functions, calculated to understand the adsorption mechanisms. Adsorption selectivity provides a better understanding of the effect exerted by the adsorption of alcohols. It is found that the adsorption of benzene from benzene/methanol mixtures is similar to its pure component isotherm. However, for increasing length of the aliphatic chain of the alcohols the adsorption behavior is reversed preventing benzene to be adsorbed. The effect of open metal sites is discarded as main responsible for the preferential adsorption of alcohols, while the entropy and the molecular packing of alcohols are revealed as the reason for the different adsorption behavior of benzene.",

    "abstract": "During the past two decades, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved towards one of the most intriguing materials of current science. The main reason for the growing attention these materials receive is their inherent hybrid nature, as they are composed of both inorganic and organic fragments. The combination of these fragments into many different structures and topologies gives rise to an almost unlimited number of existing and hypothetical MOFs. Besides the large versatility in obtainable MOF structures, these materials also often possess a stable and largely crystalline structure with a high to ultra-high porosity while retaining sufficient stability. This has allowed MOFs to be proposed for a vast variety of applications, ranging from gas storage and separation, to heterogeneous catalysis and mechanical and chemical sensing, and to (opto)electronic devices. Recently, the discovery and engineering of inherent defects and structural disorder has paved the way towards other unique applications. Furthermore, many MOFs show very fascinating stimuli-responsive properties, which may be exploited for beneficial purposes. Because of the large number of hypothetical MOF structures, an experimental characterization and screening of new candidates for state-of-the-art applications has become unfeasible. Therefore, one must rely more and more on computational techniques to predict the properties of MOFs before their actual synthesis and allow for an application-oriented design of new materials (see Figure 1). This special issue therefore gathers several articles, a communication, an essay, and a review that look at the frontiers of modeling MOFs from first principles to coarse-graining techniques. Due to MOFs’ hybrid nature, the modeling of these materials requires simulation approaches that are on the crossroads of molecular and solid-state modeling. Atomistic simulations are an active area, and there is therefore a crucial need to rely on accurate force fields not only to describe the flexibility of this class of materials but also to predict their properties for a range of applications. The challenge of designing and parametrizing adequate atomic force fields is reviewed by D. Dubbeldamm et al. (1900135) along with an outlook on new developments, such the “open force field initiative” and machine learning. The development of efficient computational toolboxes is presented by B. Space and co-workers (1900113), who describe a simulation software package to capture the adsorption and diffusion properties of guests in MOFs using polarizable force fields. A. Martin-Calvo et al. (1900112) report the development of force field parameters for the MOF MAF-6 to further predict its co-adsorption performances for a series of mixtures including aliphatic alcohols and benzene. Along with atomistic simulations, quantum mechanical calculations play an important role in the actual modeling of MOFs. This special issue contains two exemplary case studies. A. Erba and co-workers (1900093) use a fully ab initio quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics approach to predict the mechanical stability and thermophysical properties of MOF-5 considered as a protoypic MOF. J. L. Mancuso and C. H. Hendon (1900126) explore the role of Ti(IV) to modulate the electronic structure of MOFs and induce a photoactive response of the materials. A continuous effort has been deployed over the past few years to devise high-throughput screening approaches to scan MOF databases containing more than 80 000 materials. This strategy aims to assist the experimentalists with the identification of existing MOFs or refined versions with optimal performances for mainly adsorption and catalysis applications. To this end, F.-X. Coudert (1900131) comments on the increasingly relevant role of materials databases in the current community of computational scientists with some emphasis on the peculiar status of MOF databases. S. Keskin and co-workers (1900109) report an illustration of a systematic study of MOFs as fillers in mixed matrix membranes for flue gas separation. Furthermore, to further advance the field, one needs computational techniques that extend simulations to longer time scales and larger length scales than typically encountered in today's simulations. This is the purpose of the work carried out by J. Keupp and R. Schmid (1900117), in which they stimulate the thermal- and pressure-induced structural transformations in DMOF-1 crystallites by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a flexible force field for the host framework. Similarly, R. Semino and co-workers (1900116) tackle the challenge of modeling complex MOF/polymer interfaces and composites using MD. Another related article is reported by A. Ozgur Yazaydin et al. (1900120) who developed a non-equilibrium MD approach to predict the perm-selectivity of different gas mixtures in a ZIF-membrane. Finally, modeling the flexibility in MOFs can be tackled by alternative strategies. L. Vanduyfhuys et al. (1900124) and P. Melix et al. (1900098) present two approaches, a semi-analytical mean-field model and ligand field molecular mechanics, to capture the guest-induced breathing behavior of flexible MIL-53 and DUT-8 MOFs respectively. This special issue clearly emphasizes how theoretical methodologies with different levels of complexity may give be a relevant contribution to the understanding of structure–property relationships in MOFs. Yet it is also clear that modeling MOFs is a very challenging field and that a synergy between theoreticians and experimentalists is of the utmost importance to further advance. We believe this special issue offers a glance at the current frontiers in the modeling of MOFs and sheds some lights beyond them to see and/or foresee what is next. We are grateful to all authors who contributed to this special issue. We would also like to thank the editor of the journal Dr. Babak Mostaghaci along with the entire editorial staff for their invaluable work to process and manage the publication of this special issue.

A strategy of using a uniform interpolation method to investigate the laws of a continuity equation is developed. There are three major findings. First, the internal fluid velocity of the variable gradient model is greater than the internal fluid velocity of the fixed gradient model. Second, the overall temperature change of the variable gradient structure is greater than the temperature change of the control group. Third, the formula of the macroscopic average temperature change of the area‐based fluid is found to be theoretically reliable.

Since a hydrogen deficiency in the row direction is denser than a hydrogen deficiency in the chain direction, hydrogen deficiency can drive lithium‐ion deposition. Thus, lithium atoms are more stable on the surface of hydrogen‐terminated diamonds with a hydrogen deficiency in the direction of the dimer row. The adsorption of lithium atoms on hydrogen‐terminated diamond films lacking three hydrogens is more stable due to the absence of dangling chemical bonds on the surface of the hydrogen‐terminated diamond. Therefore, lithium atoms cannot be adsorbed on an all‐H‐diamond surface. The low adsorption energy of lithium atoms on a clean diamond surface indicates that it is a simple physical adsorption. H termination increases the adsorption energy and migration activation energy of Li on the diamond surface. H termination changes the migration path of Li on the diamond surface. The atomic deposition of Li is driven by the center of the H defect region on the H‐diamond surface.",

This argument is extended to more complex contact models and the presence of a magic ratio is demonstrated using real data. A method is shown to identify and operate at optimal conditions in commercial AFMs. Targeting this magic ratio provides a simple, comprehensive guideline for cantilever selection, system calibration, and imaging parameter selection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Direct, instant, and quantitative detection of molecules is highly desirable, however, optical detection of dilute gas molecules in the single molecular limit is extremely challenging. According to a recent experiment, a thin CO molecule layer will be absorbed at the edge of a metallic nanoparticle when the particle is exposed to CO environment; therefore, optical sensor becomes possible with such a layer. Here, a prototype plasmonic sensor for direct CO molecules detection based on the vibrational coupling to the surface plasmon polariton resonance in a finite metal/insulator/metal (MIM) nanocavity is proposed and investigated. Thanks to the ultrahigh spectral sensitivity of the cavity plasmon and its enhanced coupling to the CO stretch vibration, the single‐layered molecules in the cavity split the plasmon resonance in its optical spectra. The molecular signal is amplified by up to three orders of magnitude, giving a detection limit of ≈800 molecules, which lowers down the detection limit of molecule numbers by more than three orders of magnitude than the traditional surface plasmon‐based sensors. In the investigation, analytical vibration/cavity–plasmon coupling model developed herein agrees well with the numerical results. The study offers a promising way toward small molecule detection with plasmonic sensors.",

The calculated band structure reveals the non‐magnetic semiconducting character of the compound. The electronic structure is described using the electronic band structure and the densities of states. A band gap of 1.14 eV is computed within standard GGA, a value which is enhanced using hybrid functional. It separates the upper part of the valence band dominated by Co‐ 3d‐t 2 g states from the lower part of the conduction band made exclusively of Co‐ 3d‐e g , above of which lie S‐ 3p and P‐ 3p ones. The obtained values are suitable for applications in solar cells, according to Shockley–Queisser theory of light‐to‐electric conversion efficiency. The origin of the larger CoSP band gap, with respect to the one of the promising FeS 2 compound, is explained and the chemical bonding properties are addressed. A comparative picture is established where several similarities are found, suggesting that CoSP could be of great practical interest in photovoltaics.",

It offers several tools for designing complex nanostructures (including nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, nanoscrolls, etc., and combinations/permutations of them) which are either lacking or cumbersome in other existing packages. Through its intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) it enables facile ways to design and modify the size/shape and relative positions of nanoobjects while observing the changes in real time. NanoMaterialsCAD is written in C++, and exploits Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) (for the GUI), Win32API (for interaction with Windows), and Assembly (for fast data management).

The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate kappa by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the \\k{appa}-value by ~15 % as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social science, our analysis of the time dependence \\k{appa} = \\k{appa}(t) may reveal an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.",

Polymers made of pure tBN are insulators as pristine h‐BN, but substituting the central B(N) by C atom in tBN(NB) spontaneously leads to the creation of a spin‐polarized ground state polymer. Moreover, the ground state of C‐doped polymer is an open‐shell semiconductor in which both Dirac and flat bands coexist nearby Fermi level while the nearest excited state is a closed‐shell semi‐metal where the Dirac cone crossed Fermi level. The triangular shape of the monomer, the nature of atomic substitution, and the relative position of C‐dopant among the 2D polymer are contributing to create a strong collective magnetism in conjunction with a significant orbital overlap between C‐dopants separated by 1.0 nm. This collective magnetism is totally suppressed in (CtBN‐CtNB) copolymer arrangement, where the material shows a semiconducting gap with no spin‐polarization and strongly localized states around Fermi level. The results predict a 2D material with long range metal free magnetic ordering, in conjunction with high carrier mobilities from Dirac bands and anisotropic shapes of topological states, that opens the door for 2D organic spintronic applications.",

Both the electric field distribution and mode parameters originating from the proposed hybrid structure are systematically studied. The simulation results show that, under the optimal conditions with r = 95 nm, h gap = 2 nm, and d = 1 nm, three key mode parameters (effective mode area, gain threshold, and propagation distance) can be determined to be 0.008 λ 2 , 0.5997 µm −1 , and 3309 nm, respectively. Moreover, the figure of merit of the proposed nanolaser is enhanced by almost 2.3 times compared with the model without BP nanosheets.

In the present study, the drift behavior of a representative electrical parameter under HTOL stress conditions is modeled, using linear splines, and a model for the determination of test limits used to ensure reliability is formulated. These test limits are computed such that for a predefined probability the electrical parameters under consideration remain within their specification limits over the whole product lifetime. Additionally, the yield loss that might be caused by this quality control procedure should be kept as small as possible. These test limits can then be used by automated test equipment to detect conforming and non‐conforming devices immediately after production.

Atomistic simulations of inter‐NW neck growth during thermal fusion of vertically stacked silver nanowires (NWs) with nonorthogonal axes are performed, a geometric configuration that is commonly seen in applications. High NW rotation during fusion is uncovered surprisingly and found that it accelerates inter‐NW neck growth beyond that explainable by conventional geometric arguments. Rotation‐regulated surface diffusion and dislocation generation are found to be the culpable mechanisms and are shown to be dominant in distinct regimes of initial NW orientation. Motivated by these atomistic observations, an original analytical model of inter‐NW neck growth is formulated and validated. The model accurately predicts the unusual trends in neck growth with six orders of magnitude lesser computational effort than atomistic simulations. Further, it can handle nonisothermal temperature histories over millisecond time scales for NWs up to 100 nm in diameter, a capability that is beyond the reach of typical atomistic simulations. The impact of the revealed spatial disparity of nanoscale neck growth on the properties of random‐packed NW assemblies, and the foundational role of the model in rational design and processing of printed multi‐NW assemblies for a range of applications are discussed.",

However, extensive applications of DSSCs are limited by the use of organic photosensitizers and liquid electrolytes, which raises strict requirements on dye synthesis and cell encapsulation. Considering the electron‐donating tendency and optical activity of Eu 2+ , EuO semiconductor is chosen as inorganic substitution of organic dyes based on Eu 2+ ↔Eu 3+ redox transition. Through first‐principle calculations, 4f‐3d composite bandgap is found in TiO 2 /EuO heterostructure, reducing the bandgap of pure TiO 2 from 3.2 to 0.99 eV. This energy corresponds to near‐infrared photon and thus covers the whole range of visible light, which will significantly enhance the light‐absorption efficiency of TiO 2 . Similar electronic feature also appears in A TiO 3 ( A = Sr, Ba)/EuO interfaces. The bandgap value is critically dependent on bonding type and geometry structure of TiO 6 octahedra at the interface. On this basis, all‐inorganic EuO‐sensitized TiO 2 solar cell is theoretically designed, where EuO serves as photosensitizer to replace dye molecules and inject electrons into TiO 2 anode under light excitation. This finding not only provides prospect for all‐inorganic DSSCs, but also sheds light on high‐efficiency TiO 2 ‐based photocatalysis and EuO‐relevant spintronics with rich interfacial physics.",

The phonon dispersion curves and ab‐initio molecular dynamics results prove the dynamical and thermal stabilities of the structures at n ≥ 6. The bandgaps of oxidized diamond nanofilms are independent of the layer number, attributed to the main contribution of surface atoms to conductance bands and valence bands near the Fermi energy. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) calculations with n from 6 to 22 show that the bandgaps of nanofilms with ether groups on both outmost sides (ether groups on one side and hydrogen functional groups on the other side) are in the region of 1.308–1.838 eV (1.803–1.884 eV).

The calculated elastic constants and acoustic velocities of nanofilms have a significantly parity‐dependent oscillatory phenomenon and increase with increasing film thickness.

    "abstract": "Abstract We investigate using finite element methods how sub‐micrometer to micrometer‐scale coplanar waveguide (CPW) can be used for the detection of fingerprint spectra of very small (of order 10 −14 mL) volumes of analytes in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The electric field distribution is investigated near the waveguide for various gap widths between the center conductor and ground plane using a finite element simulation (ANSYS High Frequency Structure Simulator, HFSS). Taking lactose monohydrate as an exemplar material, a Drude–Lorentz model is combined for its real and imaginary permittivities with this numerical simulation, finding a significant enhancement in fingerprint detection as the gap width is reduced; the electric field in the CPW is found to increase by a factor ≈14 times moving from a 20 to 0.5‐µm‐wide gap between center conductor and ground plane, while the on‐resonance THz absorption increases ≈14 times. The effective absorption coefficient of the lactose at 530 GHz is investigated as a function of the slot width for various lactose block thicknesses to understand how change in the field confinement and in the effective overlap between the lactose block and incident THz waves affect the effective absorption coefficient.",

The reliability of the model description of Ni–Zr melts is confirmed via comparison of the simulation results with the existing experimental data on diffusion properties of Ni–Zr melts. A statistical mechanical formalism is employed to understand the behavior of the cross‐correlation between the interdiffusion flux and the force caused by the difference in the average random accelerations of atoms of different species in the short time limit . This theoretical description is exploited to analyze the simulation data on the diffusion properties of Ni–Zr melts. On this basis, it is found that in the composition range both single‐particle and collective diffusion dynamics slow down homogeneously upon undercooling of Ni–Zr melts. Furthermore, it is inferred that such homogeneous dynamical slowdown is related to the enhanced stability of undercooled melt against crystallization. As a consequence, Ni–Zr alloys within this composition range are identified as viable glass formers.",

It suggests that star polymer motion is the result of two linear relaxations coinciding in time. By analogy to linear polymers, which reptate with a random walk embedded in a 3D network, we show that star polymers relax by a random walk in a 5D network.",

Via first‐principles calculations, the influence of nitrogen and erbium concentration on the stability of ZnO is investigated. The complex (Er Zn ‐ m N O ) consisting of multiple substitutional N on O sites and one substitutional Er on Zn site is a crucial stabilizer. With an increase of the concentration of N, the absorption edges redshift to lower energy due to the impurity band broadening in the bandgap. The results suggest that codoping Er‐N into the ZnO matrix is a feasible way to manufacture stable p ‐type ZnO.",

The energy storage mechanisms of supercapacitors call for a higher degree of anion transports in the polymer electrolytes. Therefore, the improvement of anions transport is critical to the performance of supercapacitors. However, the underlying transport mechanisms of different anions in the polymer electrolyte system has rarely been studied. In the present study, by molecular modeling, it is understood and demonstrated that different anions adapt to different transfer mechanisms in the polymer electrolytes during the charging/discharging process, allowing one to tune the anion transport by either adjusting the polymer structures or change the anion types. For the H 2 SO 4 ‐poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)‐based system, the diffusion of anions is more significant, while the H 3 PO 4 ‐PVA system relies on the alignment of anions to the electrical field. The fundamental understanding will guide polymer electrolyte design for the solid‐state energy storage devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, a universal scaling law for the methane gas capture quantity in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) structure is provided. The methane–MOF adsorption events are catalogued into energy and space scenario individually. The energy factor includes three types of energy forces for both bonding and non‐bonding interactions in variant type of MOFs structures: that is, 1) metal–gas interactions, 2) heteroatom–gas bonds, and 3) non‐bonding interactions, including Van der Waals as well as Coulomb interactions. The subspace factor includes: 1) geometrical void fraction volume, 2) surface area, and 3) the limiting local pore size. Under this catalogue, more than 65 000 types of MOFs with relative high gas capture are studied; a linear scaling law can be approached via the group combination of the energy and space factor. Moreover, the decomposed scaling law indicates that for the exploring of high gas storage MOFs structure, the design of spatial geometry takes more importance than the chemical bonding of gas–MOFs interactions. The linear scaling works for other gases, like nitrogen and carbon dioxide as well. This work provides a qualitative understanding for the design of MOFs materials for the gas capture utility.",

The mechanisms that produce such \"membraneless organelles\" are not understood, but are commonly thought to involve the formation of separate phases via liquid–liquid phase separation. Here, an alternative mechanism is investigated involving short‐range attraction, long‐range repulsion (SALR) fluids, applied at model biological membrane–cytoplasm interfaces. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that giant SALR clusters can form at the membrane surface even when they are unstable in the bulk, for suitably chosen model parameters. It is also found that the formation and location of giant SALR clusters at the interface can be controlled by a third protein species confined to the membrane surface. This behavior mimics that of WASP puncta at the cell membrane, thought to involve WASP and Nck protein aggregates controlled by clathrin. The SALR mechanism is thus a good model for this system, and for membraneless organelles more generally.",

In an urge to replace cobalt as a binder phase, a demand on understanding the magnetic response as a function of composition on the atomic scale is growing. In this paper, a theoretical description of the measured weight‐specific magnetic saturation of hard metals as a function of the tungsten weight fraction present in the cobalt binder phase, based on first‐principle calculations, is established for standard WC‐Co. The predicted magnetic saturation agrees well with the experimental one. Furthermore, it is proposed that the theoretical description can be extended to alternative and more complex binder phases which allows to transfer the production control to those hard metals.",

The relationship between the cantilever thermal fluctuations and its interactions with the surrounding liquid is investigated, and an analytical model to describe the interaction forces is presented. The novelty of this approach is that a very simple integral expression to describe fluid–cantilever interactions is found. More specifically, besides including fluid inertia and viscosity, an additional diffusivity term needs to be considered, whose crucial influence for the correct evaluation of the cantilever response to the thermal excitation is shown. The coefficients of the model are obtained by using numerical results for a 2D fluid flow around a vibrating rectangular cross section, so that the dynamics of a dAFM cantilever can be characterized when it also operates in tilted conditions. The analytical model is validated by comparison with numerical and experimental data previously presented in literature, and with experiments carried out by the authors. It is shown that the present model can provide an extremely accurate prediction of the beam response up and beyond the second resonant peak.",

By means of density functional theory‐based computational simulations it is predicted that polar monoclinic and orthorhombic phases of the bulk Ln 2 H 4 O may exhibit exceptional ferro‐ and piezoelectric properties as well as electromechanical coupling characteristics that are especially suitable for the piezoelectric devices working in a shear mode. It is shown that quantitative estimates of ferro‐ and piezoelectric characteristics are well matching with the specification data of advanced ferroelectric solid solutions.

For developing an unbiased potential, a finite‐temperature dynamics machine learning (FTD‐ML) approach is proposed, and its processes and feasibility are demonstrated using the Buckingham potential model and aluminum (Al) as an example. Compared with conventional machine learning approaches, FTD‐ML exhibits three distinguished features: 1) FTD‐ML intrinsically incorporates more extensive configurational and conditional space for enhancing the transferability of developed potentials; 2) FTD‐ML employs various properties calculated directly from CMD, for ML model training and prediction validation against experimental data instead of first‐principles data; 3) FTD‐ML is much more computationally cost effective than first‐principles simulations, especially when the system size increases over 10 3 atoms as employed in this research for ensuring reliable training data. The Al Buckingham potential developed by the FTD‐ML approach exhibits good performance for general simulation purposes.

    "abstract": "Abstract The optical contrast in a phase change material is concomitant with its structural transition. These two are connected by first recognizing that Friedel oscillations couple electrons propagating in opposite directions and supply an additional Coulomb energy. As the crystal switches phase, this energy acquires time dependence and the Landau‐Zener mechanism operates, steering population transfer from the valence to the conduction band and vice versa. Spectroscopy suggests that the oscillator energy E 0 dominates the optical properties and a calculation involving the crystalline field and spin–orbit interaction yields good estimates for E 0 of both structural phases. Further analysis relates the optical gap with the crystalline‐field energy as well as activation energy for electrical conduction. This last property characterizes the amorphous phase, thereby furnishing a link between the crystalline field and the activation energy and ultimately with the resistance drift exponent. Providing optical means to quantify resistance drift in phase‐change materials (PCMs) could circumvent the need for fabricating expensive devices and performing time consuming measurements.",

A cylindrically bilayered catalyst structure wherein the ion transport materials are confined by concentric outer carbon shells is adopted to increase the number of interconnected electron and ion transport paths. For reliable statistical analysis, each data point is extracted from a set of 25 catalyst layer models to achieve a 95% confidence level. The nanoscale morphologies of the ionomers, including interconnected ion transport networks, surface coverage, and electrochemically active surface areas, are quantitatively evaluated. The statistical investigations reveal that the bilayered cylindrical catalyst structures provide more uniform and improved transport paths for ions and reactants when compared with established catalyst layers. Specifically, the additional ion transport channels in the core of the concentric vertical cylinder enhance catalyst utilization under insufficient ionomer conditions. Furthermore, the bilayered catalyst structures yield remarkably enlarged electrochemically active surface areas, hence facilitating more efficient electron, ion, and reactant transfers to improve catalyst utilization.",

As it is hard to obtain the electric behavior of anisotropic gyrotropic plasma directly, numerical simulation is regarded as one of the most important ways on the investigation. Based upon higher order formulation and an alternating‐direction‐implicit (ADI) procedure, the unconditionally stable ADI perfectly matched layer (PML) is proposed in finite‐difference time‐domain lattice to solving the open region problems for anisotropic gyrotropic plasma. To decouple the updated equations in the gyrotropic plasma regions, approximate decoupling theory is introduced during the implementations. The proposed implementation takes advantages of the higher order formulation, ADI procedure, approximate decoupling theory, and PML implementation in terms of considerable absorption, efficiency, and accuracy in open region problems. Numerical examples are carried out for the demonstration of effectiveness both in theory and experimentally. Through the results, it can be concluded that the proposed implementation is effective and accurate for terminating anisotropic gyrotropic plasma in open region problems when time step surpasses far beyond the Courant–Friedrich–Levy condition.",

Both cases demonstrate the capability of the multiscale approach to reproduce the correct macroscopic hydrodynamics also in the presence of refined grids (one and two levels), while retaining the correct thermal fluctuations, embedded in the multiparticle collision method. This provides the first step toward a novel class of fully mesoscale hybrid approaches able to capture the physics of fluids at the micro‐ and nanoscales whenever a continuum representation of the fluid falls short of providing the complete physical information, due to a lack of resolution and thermal fluctuations.",

The strategy is based on incorporation into the polymeric carrier of both weak acid and weak base functionalities. The consequence of this new design is that the polymeric vector adopts negative charge at physiological pH—facilitating complexation—while at late endosomal pH of 4.5, the polymeric vector adopts a positive charge—promoting highly efficient release of the drug. To illustrate the strategy, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out for a representative system comprising of a peptide dendrimer Gly‐Lys(Arg)2 as a model cationic drug and a short poly(4‐vinyl imidazole)‐b poly(acrylic acid) (PVI‐b‐PAA) block co‐polymer vector. Simulations suggest that these coulomb‐pH switch vectors bind the cationic drug effectively at pH = 7.0 and release it decisively once the charge state is changed to reflect pH = 4.5, as indicated by hydrogen bonding, close contact, and distance correlation analyses. Complementary experiments with bespoke synthesized peptide dendrimers indicate that the complexation involves much larger aggregrates than the one‐to‐one simulation; however unambiguous evidence is provided for the dissolution of the aggregates at pH = 4.5.",

Herein, sumanene, a representative macromolecule, and its derivatives are introduced through either individual or combined incorporation of two distinct functional groups, namely carbonyls and cyanides, to understand the effects of the functionalization strategy on their electrochemical redox properties. This computational investigation reveals that the combined incorporation of the two distinct redox‐active sites would synergistically improve the open‐circuit redox potential, ultimately leading to an exceptionally high theoretical performance of a sumanene‐derivative fully functionalized with carbonyl and cyanide. Furthermore, this study enables to draw meaningful conclusions on the three discharging stages, namely the fully charged, ongoing, and fully discharged stages. Clearly, the open‐circuit redox potential of a compound corresponding to the fully charged stage depends on its electron affinity that is dominantly contributed by the charging energy. During the discharging process, the redox potentials of the compounds gradually decrease with the increase in the number of bound Li atoms because of the Li‐induced weakening of its reductive ability owing to the continuous increase in its charging energy, leading to the cooperative contribution of charging and reorganization energies to the redox potential. At the end of the discharging process, the compound loses the cathodic activity with a negative redox potential, primarily owing to a sudden increase in solvation energy.",

The Jurin's law establishes a relationship between the contact angle and the liquid rising height inside a capillary tube and is widely employed to evaluate the wettability of transparent tubes since 1717. However, it fails once encounters the opaque counterparts because of the invisible rising height. Here, an idea that correlates the contact angle with an intrinsic property of a matter, i.e., the mass is proposed. A universal equation is thus established to compute the contact angle using the liquid mass inside the capillary tube. The equation is systematically verified against the height measurement method adopting a series of quartz capillary tubes, where a good agreement is attained. An in situ approach of high sensitivity is hence derived and demonstrated to evaluate the capillary tubes regardless of the wettability, transparency, or materials. A theoretical basis is provided to assess the surface wettability inside capillary tubes in a more general way and thus a new avenue is opened to investigate the heat and mass transfer under spatial limitation with well‐defined surfaces for portable devices, flexible electronics, etc.",

Finally, non‐dominated sorting genetic algorithm‐III (NSGA‐III) is proposed to solve a constrained many‐objective optimization problem with 9 objectives, and the design space is refined through a sensitivity analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization approach can achieve significant improvements regarding both the comprehensive performances, power repartition, and system efficiency. The simulation is conducted both on Chinese Heavy‐Duty Commercial Vehicle Test Cycle (CHTC) and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule for Heavy‐Duty Vehicles (UDDSHDV).

After examining the adsorption energy, adsorption distance, variation of bond length and Mulliken charge, the results show that only NO 2 molecule present chemical adsorption on cubine monolayer. The calculated work functions and I – V curves indicate that cubine has the highest sensitivity to NO 2 molecules. The adsorption energies decrease following the increase of strain in both A and B directions, when the strain along the A direction reaches 12%, the adsorption energy decreases to −0.686 eV, which shows physical adsorption. This provides a desorption strategy for recycling.

The second and deeper layers of PhC only contribute to both 5% extinction and absorption in the far‐field, and there is almost no difference in |E| max among different layers with the coefficient variation at ≈1%.

For very small molecules, using ma‐SVP is sufficient while for larger molecules more completed basis sets are demanded. Size‐dependent effect of prediction accuracy on different molecules is revealed by using a simple strategy, that the different sizes of molecules are distinguished with three intervals and given the corresponding mean absolute errors.

The stents are designed and placed in a blood vessel model including a fatty‐plaque layer in the study. 316L‐stainless steel, CoCr‐alloy, and nitinol are assigned to the stent models considering stent manufacturing. Modeled stents are coated with a carbon‐based structure that mimics the DLC thin film. The electrochemical simulations are performed under the dynamic non‐Newtonian blood flow condition for a 1 year period. Electrolytic current densities, corrosion, and restenosis rates of the bare and coated stents are simulated using time‐dependent laminar flow and corrosion modules in multiphysics analysis software. Among the bare‐stent models, the highest corrosion rate is observed for 316L with 79 µm year −1 and the minimum corrosion rate is observed for nitinol with 9 µm year −1 . Restenosis rates increase up to 36 µm year −1 due to the charged‐particle adhesion on the bare stent surfaces. However, DLC‐thin‐film coating reduces corrosion and in‐stent restenosis (ISR) rates down to 0.94 and 0.2 µm year −1 respectively. It can be concluded that surface passivation by thin‐film DLC coating may be considered a promising candidate for novel stent designs having lower corrosion‐based issues and ISR risks.",

Atomistic traction–separation analysis is conducted using molecular dynamics simulation technique to evaluate the interface properties between the functionalized carbon fiber surface and ZnO NW/polymer matrix. The results indicate that incorporating ZnO NW can significantly enhance interface stiffness, strength, and fracture energy. The results obtained in opening and sliding modes are implemented in the cohesive zone model to simulate the interface at the mesoscale. Microhomogenization analysis is performed on a representative volume element containing ZnO NW reinforced polymer matrix to determine the effective material properties of the enhancement layer. The interface and enhancement layer properties are imported into the macroscale hybrid SFC model. Single fiber fragmentation analysis is performed employing user material (UMAT) subroutine and ABAQUS finite element analysis package. Simulation results demonstrate that the load is transferred more efficiently from matrix to fiber in the hybrid than in the bare fiber model. The fiber fragmentation is increased in the hybrid composite structure, resulting in up to 100% improvement in interfacial shear strength of SFC incorporating ZnO NW.",

Predicting energy band alignment at the interfaces is crucial for their design, but represents a challenging problem due to the large scales of the system, the energy precision required and a wide range of physical phenomena that occur at the interface. To tackle this problem, many‐body perturbation theory in the non‐self‐consistent GW approximation, orbital relaxation corrections for organic semiconductors, and line‐up potential method for inorganic semiconductors which allows for tractable and accurate computing of energy band alignment in crystalline van‐der‐Waals hybrid inorganic–organic semiconductor interfaces are used. In this work, crystalline tetracene physisorbed on the clean hydrogen‐passivated 1 × 2 reconstructed (100) silicon surface is studied. Using this computational approach, it is found that the energy band alignment is determined by an interplay of the mutual dynamic dielectric screening of two materials and the formation of a dipole layer due to a weak hybridization of atomic/molecular orbitals at the interface. The significant role of the exchange‐correlation effects in predicting band offsets for the hybrid inorganic–organic semiconductor interfaces is also emphasized.",

The methodology is applied to study pyroelectricity under nonequilibrium conditions in prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO 3 . It is found that at room temperature the nonequilibrium effects in pyroelectricity begin manifesting above 1.0 THz and originate from the overlap with the intrinsic soft mode frequency. Therefore, the proposed computational methodology can be used to predict equilibrium pyroelectric response by choosing a frequency of temperature variation below the intrinsic polar mode frequencies for the material. Probing the dynamics of ferroelectric phase transition with the proposed methodology revealed that it takes about a nanosecond for the computational supercell to undergo phase transition. It is concluded that computational techniques capable of simulating picoseconds can be used to compute pyroelectric response from nonequilibrium dynamical approach while those that can reach nanoseconds are suitable for simulating phase transitions in ferroelectrics.",

Self‐assembly of the nucleic acid bases, which are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonding, in both solution and solid have been well characterized by various experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Especially for the surface based self assemblies, the resolution of STM images is quite insufficient to reveal the dominating intermolecular interactions which lead to the formation of self‐assembled DNA bases. Moreover, it is also possible to form crystalline order self assemblies by finding suitable experimental conditions. This fact allows the application of crystal structure prediction (CSP) tools for the discovery of ordered self assemblies. In this regard, the existing CSP method called FFCASP has been extended with a new implementation allowing the prediction of 1D or 2D periodic and nonperiodic structures. The new approach, 2D‐FFCASP, has been applied to four DNA bases and the best resulting structures have been further evaluated by dispersion‐corrected density functional theory (DFT‐D) and cluster in a molecule local correlation approach at the second‐order Møller–Plesset perturbation (CIM‐RI‐MP2). 2D‐FFCASP successfully reproduced the known self‐assemblies of DNA bases in addition to many newly found isoenergetic structures.",

The order parameter P 2 , velocity, and density of 5CB are profiled as a function of distance from the walls using a block analysis method. The flow‐alignment phenomenon is reproduced, and alignment angles ranging from 11.3° to 13.9° are observed. The competition between the elastic effect of the surface and viscous effect of the flow on the orientation of the 5CB molecules is investigated. The P 2 of 5CB located in the vicinity of the grooved walls is higher than that of the flat walls, while this difference is negligible in the case of 5CB distanced from the walls. Instead of boundary slip or Couette flow, the velocity profiles reveal a boundary condition (BC) of central localization, which is very different from the assumed Couette flow BC in most analytical models of LC flow. This work enhances the current molecular‐scale understanding of the flow behavior of confined liquid crystals and provides additional insights into the phenomenon.",

To establish a remarkable structure‐property (SP) linkage, a novel concept referred to as irregular‐representative volume element (IRVE) based on panoramic image stitching technology (PIST) is proposed and a data‐driven scheme integrating irregular domain‐oriented two‐point statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and symbolic regression based on genetic programming (GPSR) is constructed. Combining with advanced image processing and genetic programming technologies, this scheme improves the microstructure quantization framework. This scheme can not only be applied in different complex conditions for extracting the information of a material microstructure, but can also to embody details of microstructure from the perspective of large scale. IRVE is demonstrated to have both strong statistical representativeness and sufficient physical interpretation, which makes the scheme robust and reliable. Performing the scheme on an example of ferrite heat‐resistant steels, it shows a powerful ability in building an equational SP linkage with high precision ( R = 0.91, RMSE = 13.17), the generalization ability of the linkage is also validated by an unseen steel (relative percentage error is 2.66%).

Sensitivity analysis has proven to be an important tool to quantify and trace this uncertainty to specific input parameters. In this study, the methodology of a prominent global sensitivity analysis method, that is, Sobol's variance‐based method, is presented for chemical modeling with a focus on microkinetic modeling. Sobol's method is developed to be used as an analysis framework, which—once set‐up for microkinetic modeling—can easily be used for different models. This analysis framework is successfully demonstrated by means of two case studies from the field of microkinetic modeling: 1) CO oxidation and 2) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the photoanode in a photo‐electrochemical cell. The results give insight into the influence of each input parameter on the output uncertainty. For CO oxidation, it is found that the temperature and chemisorption energies have most impact on the output. For the OER model, the valence band energy and solvent reorganization energy are most influential. Based on this, a workflow is proposed incorporating the sensitivity analysis into the modeling process, aimed at reducing the output uncertainty and at validating and optimizing the model.",

It is difficult to solve the wave propagation because of the spatial heterogeneity and the intrinsic viscoelasticity of solidifying metals. In this paper, a physico‐mathematical model is developed by coupling the unsteady temperature field and the integral Hooke–Kelvin model unifying various rheological models during solidification, and simplifies to wave equations by introducing memory factors. Then, the wave equations are solved by a staggered‐grid high‐order difference method. Subsequently, the propagation laws of mechanical waves in a large casting and a feeding channel during solidification are analyzed, eventually verified by casting experiments. It is shown that the viscoelasticity of solidifying metals is significant for the wave field. In the large casting, both displacements and stresses exhibit complex multi‐lobe patterns. In the feeding channel, the formation of micropores between the quasi‐liquid and the quasi‐solid phase and the feeding improvement by vibrations are well explained by simulation. The numerical model is a novel reliable method to theorize the solidification under vibration and expands the potential applications of vibration.",

The above issues may lead to the imbalance of detection accuracy and shape robustness. In order to alleviate the above contradictions, a new auxiliary network key point generation network (GPNet) is proposed to improve the performance of existing object detectors. Specifically, a series of key points are generated through ground truth (GT) supervision to obtain more global information. These key points generate pseudo boxes (Pbox) with learnable parameters. Pbox has more specific prior information than the manually designed candidate boxes. The scale information of the Pbox is embed into the classification branch to obtain a more appropriate receptive field. In addition, a novel improved strategy for label assignment by combining Pbox and GT to enhance the ability to classify positive and negative samples is proposed. Extensive experiments on multiple dense prediction methods validate the effectiveness of GPNet, with a performance improvement of 1.5 AP over baseline. In particular, with ResNext‐101‐64× 4d‐DCN as the backbone, this method achieves 49.5 AP with single‐scale testing.",

In this paper, the adsorption of a single stranded DNA molecule onto a graphene sheet is considered. Even though DNA molecules are complicated heterogeneous structures comprising several types of atoms, it is found that the repeated patterns within the DNA molecules enable the use of a continuum approach to model the DNA‐graphene sheet interaction. Here, a model is proposed such that the heterogeneity across the DNA molecule is captured by interaction functions, which are used to replace the attractive and repulsive constants in the Lennard‐Jones potential. Result from this new model shows better agreement to molecular dynamics simulations compared to the traditional continuum approach where atoms on the DNA are averaged evenly across the molecule. Finally, the paper comments on the model, its parameters, and suggests ways for improvement.",

Additionally, ω‐graphene exhibits intrinsic semimetallic characteristics with a Dirac cone located at 0.08 eV below the Fermi level. In particular, the Dirac cone of ω‐graphene persists throughout the entire strain range. A highly negative Poisson's ratio and semimetallic properties endow ω‐graphene with excellent potential for practical application to nanomechanical and nanoelectronic devices.",

Many molecular classification strategies are proposed for CRC but few studies include survival data in their models. Herein a prognosis‐oriented CRC classifier is constructed by adapting the natural partially labeled censored survival data into a customized semi‐supervised learning algorithm, which is called Monte‐Carlo K‐nearest neighbor voting (MC‐KV) classifier. Three CRC subtypes with distinct prognoses are identified by this classifier using the data from the cancer genome atlas. Furthermore, a six‐gene risk model is constructed by combining weighted gene coexpression network analysis and least absolute selection and shrinkage operator for variable selection and four algorithms (random survival forest, support vector machine, Adaboost, and logistic regression) for optimization. The optimized model shows great performance in distinguishing high‐risk from low‐risk patients with a maximum area under curve of 0.869, 0.906, and 0.921 in 1‐, 3‐, and 5‐year survival, respectively. Additionally, the six‐gene signature identified by MC‐KV exhibits great predictive efficiency for other cancer types. Overall, a tool, Monte‐Carlo K‐nearest neighbor voting (MC‐KV), is provided to identify molecular subtyping of CRC, which suggests the potential contribution of semi‐supervised algorithms and the inclusion of patient‐level survival data in cancer classification.",

The bending effect on the electronic properties and nonlinear optical (NLO) responses of linear porphyrin oligomer is explored using quantum chemistry methods by designing a series of curved structures with different bending degrees. The highest occupied molecular orbital−lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap ( E gap ) of the linear porphyrin oligomer decreases after being bended to form the curved structures, and the E gap values and orbital distributions show independent behavior on bending degree. In the electronic absorption spectra, the maximum absorptions mainly come from the S 0 → S 1 /S 0 → S 2 transitions with the characteristic of local excitation. The NLO response presents a tendency to increase and then decrease with decreasing the bending degree, which is in good accordance with the widely used two‐level model.

Three intrinsic half‐metallic multiferroic monolayers AV 2 S 4 (A = Na, K, and Rb) are predicted based on the first‐principles calculations. From the calculations, their ground states are all ferromagnetic and are completely spin‐polarized at the Fermi level. Their total magnetic moments are always 3.00 μ B per primitive cell, which origin mainly from V‐ions. The two‐center electronic structure t 2g 6 ↑t 2g 4 ↓e g 1 ↑ of V‐ions is proposed from the perspective of the crystal field theory to explain successfully the calculated magnetic moments. Interestingly, the alkali‐metal ions are non‐magnetic, but they may cause important influence on the magnetic coupling between transition ions, and then the half‐metallicity of these monolayers. Their electric and magnetic properties may be tuned by their charge states and strains. Especially, their half‐metallic stability may be evidently improved by the tensile strains. The half‐metallic gaps of these monolayers may be increased by about 67.4%, 50.8%, and 32.4% for NaV 2 S 4 , KV 2 S 4 , and RbV 2 S 4 by the tensile strain 2.0%, respectively.",

The electronic properties are calculated for the NiW 6 Se 8 and Ni 2 W 6 Se 8 compounds with thermodynamical, mechanical, and dynamic stabilities. For photocatalytic water splitting, the band gaps below 1.23 eV are excluded, and the conduction and valence band levels are determined to examine the reduction and oxidation potentials for efficient photocatalytic water‐splitting materials. An examination of the selected band gaps, along with the conduction and valence band levels, reveals that NiW 6 Se 8 is suitable for both reduction and oxidation reactions; whereas, Ni 2 W 6 Se 8 is a convenient material only for the reduction reaction. This is the first attempt, as far as the literature reveals, to study Chevrel phases in detail and to identify a suitable compound for photocatalytic water splitting.",

Less is known about how the mechanical and morphological parameters of the cellular materials influence their biologically relevant functions. A simple descriptive 2D numerical model of a cellular material based on Voronoi diagrams is presented here which aims prompt investigation how structural parameters influence its physical properties. The preliminary numerical simulations demonstrate that with an increasing wall thickness the energy dissipation increases and with an increasing cell density also an average stress increases. Other interesting results are that an increased dissipation constant of cellular material reduces the stress, and that in hierarchical foams the dissipation takes place mostly in the thick walls. The presented approach allows screening the influence of further material features and structural parameters, such as for example, different kinds of gradients or different properties of biological or biologically inspired cellular materials at different loading conditions. Direct comparison of different real biological structures could be also performed, especially when real experimental measurements are impossible.",

The concentration and spatial position of Co adatom on graphene is regulated by the architecture of SAN. The obtained optimized geometry shows that Co adatom ends up at the top of a C atom on graphene in the heterostructure. The spin‐polarized calculations upon Co‐SAN/G, illustrate that Co adsorption on top site, which is favored by the self‐assembling network, causes an alternating change in the local density of states (LDOS) of graphene that consequently gives rise to sublattice symmetry‐breaking effects reflected in the different gap opening at K valleys. It is demonstrated that a single Co atom adsorbed on top of a C atom on graphene generates similar physical properties as Co‐SAN/G and, in fact, the SAN acts as a template for patterning Co on graphene without interfering with the magnetic properties originated from the adsorbate. Furthermore, Co atoms in the Co‐SAN/G structure, which are localized on just one sublattice type and separated by 10 Å in a triangular lattice, constitute ferromagnetically aligned spin centers.",

Extending the standard simulation methodologies to the nonspherical objects is non‐trivial. To circumvent this problem, nonspherical bodies are often treated as a collection of constituent spherical objects. As the number of these constituent objects becomes large, the computational burden to simulate the system also increases. Here, an alternative way is proposed to simulate nonspherical rigid bodies having pairwise repulsive interactions. This approach is based on a machine learning (ML)‐based model, which predicts the overlap between two nonspherical bodies. The ML model is easy to train and the computation cost of its implementation remains independent of the number of constituent spheres used to represent a nonspherical rigid body. When used in MC simulation, this method is faster than the standard implementation, where overlap determination is based on calculating the distance between constituent spheres. This proposed ML‐based MC method produces similar structural features (in comparison to the standard implementation) in both two and three dimensions, and can qualitatively capture the isotropic to nematic transition of rigid rods in three dimensions. It is believed that this work is a step toward a time‐efficient simulation of non‐spherical rigid bodies.",

However, realizing a high‐Q factor in a single dielectric cavity remains a challenge especially in lossy systems such as that in plasmonics. Here, the resonant modes of a dielectric cylinder excited is explored by bessel‐type plasmon polaritons and reveal the general dependence of its eigenfrequency on the physical size. Based on this fundamental a universal and robust approach is proposed to find the high‐Q supercavity modes, which arise in the vicinity of the resonance crossing features of two coupled resonant modes in the same radiation channel. Following the proposed principle, one cannot only construct a series of high‐Q modes, but also predict their corresponding size parameters and resonant frequencies without relying on the heavy computations of parameter scanning. Such high‐Q mode can be easily extended from visible wavelengths to other frequency regime due to scale invariance of the eigenfrequency and the insensitivity of the Q‐factor to the permittivity (real part) of the plasmonic substrate. The findings provide guideline for the engineering of high‐Q modes and may open up a pathway to design resonant meta‐optics devices in lossy dielectric‐metal composite system.",

However, most existing jumping robots can only move in a plane, and achieving stable continuous steering jumping is difficult. In this study, a realization method of stable continuous steering jumping for a bioinspired jerboa robot is proposed. On the basis of the jumping mechanism of the jerboa, the robot mechanism model is established, and the factors affecting motion feasibility and performance are analyzed in detail. Then, mathematical models of the stability indices of the robot jumping on uneven ground with redundant driving are established. Based on the proposed improved bee colony algorithm, the motion parameters and driving parameters can be determined. Simulation results show that the robot can realize stable continuous steering jumping in different terrains along the expected trajectory, thus proving the feasibility of the method proposed in this study.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides accurate flow patterns, but this approach can be computationally expensive for large or complex geometries. To overcome this limitation, a new Lagrangian‐based method is developed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to forecast the flow patterns and residence time distribution of two different fluids for various reactor geometries: (laminar, fractal, T‐mixer, Hartridge–Roughton (H‐R) mixer and packed bed with a gyroid internal packing) and compared the results with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The SPH method is less accurate than the CFD analysis, but it obtained the approximate flow behavior much faster. Consequently, the SPH method has significant potential as a first screening technique to optimize reactor topologies and internal packing structures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The capacity of rechargeable battery is mainly controlled by two factors: maximum number of ions that can be held by an electrode material and its weight. In general, the weight and hence the specific capacity of a battery is mainly affected by the cathode material. In this context, Sc, the lightest transition metal, could prove helpful in achieving the goal of high theoretical capacity. Therefore, here the performance of two‐dimensional (2D) ScS 2 nanosheets (both hexagonal‐H and trigonal‐T) as cathode materials for alkali‐ion batteries (Li, Na, and K) and other multivalent metal‐ion batteries (Mg and Al) is studied. The first‐principles calculations show that 2D H and T─ScS 2 nanosheets deliver large theoretical capacity of 491.36 mA h g −1 for alkali ions and 324.29 m'A h g −1 for Mg and Al ions while maintaining good average open‐circuit voltages. Results also suggest low diffusion barriers for all metal ions except Al, with T─ScS 2 exhibiting ultra‐low barriers for alkali atoms. Overall, this study provides a fundamental and a comprehensive view on the potential capabilities of both H─ScS 2 and T─ScS 2 by defining the underlying mechanism from the perspective of a cathode material which may prove helpful in designing light‐weight and high‐capacity transition metal sulfide‐based metal‐ion batteries in the future.",

However, the stress accumulated during the continuous electrochemical cycle will cause the inevitable electrode failure, which inhibits the further improvement of battery performance. In order to eliminate/relieve the internal stress problem, a variety of battery material structures have been designed. In the design of battery material structure, the simulation technology is used to conduct battery modeling to predict the experimental results, which effectively reduces the range of parameters. For this reason, this paper first introduces the parameters that need to be considered by establishing stress model. Then, the utilization of simulation technology in the structural design of diverse battery materials is examined in this study. Finally, the future application of simulation technology in the field of energy storage is prospected. This is aimed to encourage the widespread utilization of simulation technology in the energy storage battery industry, with the goal of reducing design‐related energy consumption, enhancing experimental design feasibility, and minimizing experimentation costs.",

First, the heart sound recordings are down‐sampled, denoised by wavelet transform, and normalized. Second, a new heart sound screening algorithm is proposed. The waveform of the heart sound recording is segmented and saved as an image which is performed by the gray‐scale processing to calculate the amplitude of the heart sound. The extremely noisy heart sound segments are screened out based on the amplitude information, and the remaining heart sound segments are spliced as pure heart sound recordings. After 50% superposition segmentation of the heart sound recordings, high‐order spectral features are extracted and image data are stored. Finally, a 34‐layer mCNN is specifically designed to boost the performance of heart sound classification through multi‐layer dimensionality reduction. Experimental results show that the proposed method has superior performance compared with the existing one. For the two‐category dataset, the accuracy with and without PCG screening is 97.99% and 99.42%, respectively. For the five‐category dataset, the average accuracy is 99%.",

Various practical applications, including wearable devices, lasers, optical sensors, high‐resolution microscopy, both virtual and augmented reality, and metasails, require large‐scale metasurfaces. However, layout generation for large metasurfaces, faces challenges as up to billions of unit cells are required to create a metasurface, resulting in slow speeds and high memory demands. Here, a new framework namely ParallelGDS is proposed for fully parallel, ultra‐fast, and memory‐independent generation of graphic design system (GDSII) files for arbitrarily large metasurfaces. Compared to existing methods such as GDSTk, GDSPy, LUMERICAL's polystencil, the proposed framework significantly accelerates the layout generation process by factors of 10 to 100. More importantly, ParallelGDS drastically reduces the required memory (an problem) with an average reduction factor of where is the normalized metasurface diameter, as the framework uses only ≈2 GB of memory regardless of the size of the metasurface. The proposed framework offers complete control over memory requirements and parallelization levels of layout generation, ranging from single‐core CPU usage to multithreaded CPU utilization, and finally, full utilization of all GPU cores.",

In this paper, the interactions of corannulenes are modeled inside carbon nanotubes of various sizes using the Lennard–Jones potential and a continuum approach. The major contribution of this work is the analytical expressions for the interaction energy, which are obtained as a function of the nanotube's radius, the offset distance of corannulene from the tube's axis and the orientation of corannulene. Minimizing this energy, the range of nanotube's radii that allow the corannulene to adopt lying, tilting and standing configurations both on‐ and off‐axis of the nanotubes is determined. These results are supported by the density functional theory calculations and agree with previously published work using molecular dynamics simulations for corannulenes located on the nanotube's axis.",

Presently, machine learning research in composites primarily centers around predicting composite properties or optimizing microstructures to attain specific properties. This paper presents a data‐driven approach to predict the complete architecture of composites. A multi‐output machine learning model, based on conventional XGBoost algorithms, is developed to comprehend the intricate correlation between composite architecture and elastic wave propagation in them. The machine learning model uses input elastic wave signals collected at one face of the composite cube, induced by an actuator on the opposite face of the cube, as features. The composition labels are 3D matrices that represent the architectures of the composite cubes. The results show that the architecture of composites can be predicted using a short period of elastic wave travel through the composites, with up to 96% accuracy. This method can be readily adapted and implemented for any industry application requiring the determination of the architecture of unknown composites without destruction.",

The system's bulk‐band‐inversion is analyzed, and the ‐topological indexes are calculated using LDA and mBJLDA exchange functionals. Strong topological insulating behavior in LaBi is confirmed from bulk band inversion. Linearly dispersive Dirac‐cone in the (001)‐surface band structure is observed. The other LaX binaries also exhibit bulk‐band‐inversion under LDA+SOC settings but disappear after including the mBJ potential. The robustness of the surface Dirac cone is tested by estimating the surface band structure under uniaxial strain. The result shows that Dirac‐cone in the (001)‐surface is unaltered only for the LaBi system and destroyed in all other three binaries, concluding the topologically trivial nature of LaP, LaSb, and LaAs. The investigation is further extended to study the multilayer LaX 1 /LaX 2 systems composed of an alternate stacking of two different LaX binaries. The findings suggest that the multilayer structures exhibit topological insulating behavior only when LaBi is present in the system. Bulk‐band‐inversion and surface Dirac‐cone structures in LaBi/LaAs, LaBi/LaSb, and LaBi/LaP multilayers are observed. Furthermore, the surface Dirac cones remain unchanged under the influence of TR‐preserving perturbation, confirming these systems possess strong topological insulating character.",

Based on such an electronic characteristic, a theoretical model of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is proposed composed only of one of the 2D InX. In doing so, the two semi‐infinite pieces of 2D InX in the half‐metallic state is assumed as the opposite electrodes which are separated by a strip of the same material but in its nonmagnetic state. Owing to the 2D nature of InX, the half metal electrodes of the InX device induced by hole doping can be achieved by using split gating technique. The numerical simulations identify a proper hole doping concentration, at which 100% tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios can be realized, accompanying an appreciable conductance of majority spin electron under parallel magnetization configuration. Under a finite bias voltage, the TMR ratio remains high. Therefore, the proposed device model is an ideal candidate for future spintronics applications. It enables electrical control of TMR and circumvents the detriment of hetero‐interface disorder inevitable in conventional MTJs.",

    "abstract": "We considered the problem how to handle the exploding number of possibilities to be sorted into irreducible classes by using a clustering tool when its input capacity cannot accommodate the total number of the possibility. Concrete situations are explained taking examples of atomic substitutions in the supercell modeling of alloys. The number of the possibility sometimes amounts to $\\sim$ trillion being too large to be accommodate. It is hence not practically feasible to identify how many irreducible classes exist by straightforward manner even though there are several tools available to perform the clustering. We have developed a stochastic framework to avoid the shortage of capacity, providing a method to estimate the total number of irreducible classes (the order of the classes) as a statistical estimate. A prominent conclusion derived here is that the statistical variation of the number of classes at each sampling trial is working as a promising measure to estimate the order.",

Binding strengths of antibodies slightly differ, as further confirmed by calculating solvent accessible surface areas. Polar uncharged residues of RBD more predominantly bind to antibodies than do charged or hydrophobic residues of RBD. In particular, the binding between RBD and antibody is more significantly stabilized by multivalent hydrogen bonds of RBD residues (≈406th–505th) than by locally formed hydrogen bonds of only a few RBD residues (≈417th–487th or ≈487th–505th).

Using light to interconvert between states with distinct and externally readable features such as optical properties, these photo‐responsive phase change materials (PCMs) are ideal candidates for photonic applications. In this context, correlating macroscopic phenomena with properties at the atomistic level is crucial to systematically tailor the performance of PCMs. In particular, to establish a bottom‐up strategy to engineer PCMs based on molecular building units, a detailed understanding of the dynamic properties is needed. Therefore, an atomistic study is reported capturing the structural evolution during the light‐induced phase transition of a tetra‐(azobenzene)‐methane based PCM. This out‐of‐equilibrium dynamics is accurately represented by an atomistic potential, developed using a population swapping genetic algorithm. The molecular mechanism of the phase transition is deciphered and the refractive index of the periodic matrix is investigated. Due to an interplay of structural rigidity and flexibility, already small structural rearrangements lead to alteration of the optical properties, which is fundamental to ensure high data‐transfer rates. By correlating molecular properties with the resulting functionality, the reported work provides an important step towards in silico engineering of photo‐responsive PCMs.",

However, existing systems based on the control of pH, temperature, or nitrogen that stimulate microalgae through a culture medium face difficulties in maintaining the stress or are accompanied by complicated procedures to exert this stress, which decreases the lipid productivity. Here, the mechanobiological stimulations of algal cells via effective collisions in a soft lattice and phototaxis system are presented for energy harvesting. An energy harvesting system with a soft lattice (i.e., a micropillar array) is designed, which radiates light through a waveguide. Numerical simulations show that the average number of collisions when the distance of the soft lattice is set to be 10 mm and the intensity of light is set to 30 W m −2 is increased by up to 300% than in conditions without light. However, more interestingly, this amplifying effect disappears when the distance of the soft lattice becomes significantly small (e.g., 0.1 mm) owing to the reduced gradient and excessively enhanced intensity of light by their superposition. This analysis provides important insights into the design of mechanobiological stimulation‐based energy harvesting systems of algal cells.",

In order to understand the interaction between these, an insight onto the microscopic arrangement of molecules is needed. As a representative case, 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM] + [DCA] − ) mixtures are studied with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water in bulk phase using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Different molar fractions of DMSO and water are studied to elucidate the influence of the molecular solute concentration on the structuring of the ILs. The results indicate that DMSO‐[EMIM] + [DCA] and water‐[EMIM] + [DCA] − mixtures are defined by quite distinct molecular interactions between the species. By increasing the DMSO or water concentration, in the former the solute molecules are repelled from the ions, while in the latter they accumulate closer to the ions. The differences arise from the weakening of the interactions between the ions imposed by the presence of the water molecules whereas DMSO promotes a strengthening of these interactions. Accordingly, this study provides a deep understanding of the IL behavior in combination with neutral solute molecules and allows for a proper selection of IL‐solute combinations in view of specific technological applications.",

The ground‐state structures of Bi 2 O 2 X have been determined experimentally (in space group I 4/ mmm ). However, for Bi 2 OX 2 , only Bi 2 OS 2 has been synthesized in the experiment (in space group P 4/ nmm ). In previous theoretical studies, the crystal structures of Bi 2 OSe 2 and Bi 2 OTe 2 are assumed the same as that of Bi 2 OS 2 . Whether they can be experimentally synthesized remains an open question. Here, a swarm intelligence‐based structural prediction is employed in combination with first‐principles calculations to predict the crystal structures of Bi 2 OSe 2 . Three thermodynamically stable low‐energy phases ( P 2 1 / m , P 4/ nmm , and P 2 1 / m ′) are identified. Importantly, the newly reported P 2 1 / m phase, instead of the previously assumed P 4/ mmm phase, has the lowest energy. The P 2 1 / m ‐Bi 2 OSe 2 shows marginal stability with respect to decomposition into binary compounds Bi 2 O 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 . The predicted phases of Bi 2 OSe 2 have bandgaps of 0.67–1.19 eV and comparable small electron and hole carrier effective mass (less than 0.65 m 0 ). The different phase stability between Bi 2 OSe 2 and Bi 2 OS 2 are explained in terms of different Bi─S and Bi─Se covalent bonding characters. Our work provides theoretical guidance for discovering new phases of Bi 2 OSe 2 and an in‐depth understanding of the structure‐property relationship of Bi─O─S/Se system.",

In contrast to traditional random porous membranes with tortuous flow paths, isoporous membranes offer the opportunity to achieve a high degree of membrane customization and low pressure drop. Here, a physics‐based machine learning methodology that enables the predictive design of a single‐layer isoporous membrane in terms of the pressure drop is reported. In short, the methodology consists of a hybrid approach that includes experimental data on the variability of the pore architecture and the resulting pressure drop, training of a neural network with data from validated physics‐based simulations of laminar flow through the membrane, and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to stochastically account for the inherent variabilities of the pore architecture of fabricated isoporous membranes. Overall, the neural network and MCS predict the range of Δ p for a given single‐layer membrane well. Experimental values fall within 90% of the minimum and maximum predicted Δ p values. In addition, a sensitivity analysis with MCS is carried out to quantify how design and operating parameters affect the overall pressure drop. The methodology can be extended to membranes comprising multiple layers and to account for filtration efficiency.",

Further energy decomposition analysis indicates that the induced effect accounts for more than 18% of intermolecular interaction attraction terms in planar isomers, reflecting the indispensable covalent‐like feature of H‐bonds in energetic molecular systems. Moreover, molecular orbitals exhibit clear delocalization characteristics penetrating H‐bond regions, which also provide important evidence for covalent‐like features of H‐bonds.

As a result of segregation, the atomic rearrangements in the near‐surface environment are likely to generate additional phases to the original one such as strontium carbonate (SrCO 3 ) at high CO 2 pressure. In the current work, first principal calculations are carried out for modeling the initial formation of SrCO 3 after Sr segregation in LSFCr with CO 2 presence. It is found that the tendency of CO 2 to participate in SrCO 3 phase formation is a competing reaction to its reduction to CO on the LSFCr material, and O vacancies are needed not only to improve CO 2 reduction but also to block the competing reaction of SrCO 3 adsorption. Therefore, LSFCr successfully “raises the bar” of CO 2 reduction catalytic efficiency by preventing unwanted Sr segregation at high concentrations of surface oxygen vacancies.",

In contrast, using a numerical energy minimization approach, we find that there are multiple metastable solutions where the director profile is oscillatory. At low voltages, we find small oscillations, which evolve into standard soliton‐like domain walls as the applied voltage is increased. We predict the thickness of the domain wall with a simple analytic model that gives a good comparison to our numerical calculations, in the standard domain wall regime. For dual‐frequency nematic LCs, the occurrence of this regime can be tuned by a change of the biasing frequency. Moreover, we investigate how domain walls can affect the optical properties of LC‐based devices. For instance, we find that the transmittance curve shifts to higher voltages as domain walls are introduced. This shift can be used to create an efficient tunable filter.",

However, the calculation efficiency of applying the unstructured FE method directly to the steel casing model is poor. To this end, this article develops an FE approach based on a hybrid grid by using slender prismatic elements to mesh the steel casing area, while the remaining areas are still discretely meshed with tetrahedra. By showing numerical examples of the vertical single steel casing and L‐shaped steel casing models, the advantages of the method are tested by evaluating the response curves and the degrees of freedom. The results show that prismatic elements are suitable for discretizing steel casing areas. This approach can maintain the high accuracy of the numerical solution and reduce the number of elements required for discretizing the steel casing area. Hybrid grids can greatly increase the computational efficiency of the FE method for steel casing forward modeling.",

Devices consisting of spherical nanocrystals have been proven to be suitable components of such devices owing to their easy dispersity. However, complex geometries of the NCs and suitably controlled dispersion can facilitate large scale synthesis by reducing the requisite density of nanocrystals at the threshold of conduction. Here, simulation results are reported exploring different NC geometries. The results show that the conduction threshold is lowered depending on the complexity of the NC geometry. The effective interaction between the NCs is quantified by measuring the structure factor. The results are interesting from the synthesis point of view.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While extensive studies have been carried out on 2D crystals, their disordered counterpart, namely 2D glasses, remain poorly explored. Using molecular dynamics simulation, it is demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN) can exhibit crystallization and glass transition. Similar to archetypical glasses, it is observed that the glassy structures are disordered, marked by the absence of any long‐range order while exhibiting some short‐range order. Further, the structures obtained are stable in three dimensions, confirming the realistic nature of the 2D glasses. Interestingly, it is observed that the orientational order of the h‐BN structure with respect to density as well as ground state enthalpy follows a master curve for both crystallization and glass transition, revealing thermally accessible regions for the structure. Further, the standard deviation of orientational order provides information about the spatial heterogeneity in the structure, the rearrangement of which results in the formation of crystal/glass. This suggests that the orientational order may play a crucial role in controlling the propensity for crystallization/glass transition in systems having directional bonds.",

    "abstract": "Adv. Theory Simul. 2018, 1, 1800032 DOI: 10.1002/adts.201800032 The authors regret a mistake in their previously published paper and would like to communicate a correction. Throughout the manuscript, the values for the energetic disorder σ that had been investigated were stated to be 0 meV, 30 meV, 50 meV, and 70 meV. Due to a mistake in the implementation, these values need to be rescaled by a factor of 2 and therefore correspond to 0 meV, 42.4 meV, 70.7 meV, and 99.0 meV, respectively. These values should be replaced throughout the text and figures. For readability, we will refer to the new disorder values as 0 meV, 40 meV, 70 meV, and 100 meV in the following. The change in the values for σ affects the definition of the disorder radii r σ , i.e., the radii after which the influence of energetic disorder dominates over that of Coulomb interaction, which in turn affects the absolute and relative disorder times extracted from the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. We have re-evaluated all results with respect to the new values of σ. The results show a slight decrease in disorder times t d i s , both in absolute and relative terms, for all investigated parameter combinations with finite σ. There is no change in separation and transport times as well as in the pair lifetimes. Since the changes in t d i s are only minor, the most relevant changes in the correction represents the re-labeling of the values for σ in the text and figures. The main conclusion of the paper, namely a slow charge pair separation at large disorder and low permittivity, does not change. The re-interpretation of the absolute times with the new values for σ leads to a more realistic quantification of the time-scales involved in the dynamics of electron-hole pair separation. Table 1 shows the corrected values for r σ according to the new values of σ and replaces Table 2 of the original manuscript. Since σ was underestimated, the r σ decrease for the corrected values of σ. Figure 1 illustrates the evaluation steps at σ = 100 meV instead of σ = 70 meV and replaces Figure 2 of the original manuscript. The trajectory in Figure 1a shows a single charge pair at 100 meV including the corresponding disorder radius of 4.1 nm instead of previously 5.9 nm. The distribution of disorder times t d i s in Figure 1b, the cumulative distribution of the disorder times in Figure 1c and the 75% (disorder-) threshold times in Figure 1d, are slightly shifted towards smaller times because a smaller disorder radius is reached faster. Following this evaluation with the updated r σ , Figure 2 shows the re-evaluated absolute values of the characteristic times with the re-scaled axis description for σ ranging from 0 meV to 100 meV; it replaces Figure 3 of the original manuscript. For finite values of disorder, the results show a slight decrease of t d i s compared to the previous results. At a small disorder of 40 meV, t d i s is also of the order of ns and varies between 3.8 · 10 − 9 s at ε = 3 and 2.0 · 10 − 9 s at ε = 5 (instead of previously 5.7 · 10 − 9 s at ε = 3 and 3.0 · 10 − 9 s at ε = 5 for σ = 30 meV ). At a large disorder of 100 meV, t d i s increases to μs and varies between 3.7 · 10 − 6 s at ε = 3 and 2.7 · 10 − 7 s at ε = 5 (instead of previously 3.8 · 10 − 6 s at ε = 3 and 3.2 · 10 − 7 s at ε = 5 for σ = 70 meV ). For the separation-, transport- and lifetimes no changes are obtained compared to the previous evaluation. The decrease in disorder times shifts in favor of increased interim times. The effect of the wrong r σ on the absolute times is therefore only small and affects only the disorder and interim times. The relative times for σ ranging from 0 meV to 100 meV are shown in Figure 3 for the re-evaluation of the data; the figure replaces Figure 4 of the original manuscript. Also here, for finite values of disorder, the relative disorder time decreases and shifts in favor of the relative interim time. The sum of disorder and interim time (the relative separation time) remains unchanged, and with it the relative transport time. At a small disorder of 40 meV, the relative disorder time decreases by up to 16% compared to the previous results, while the relative interim time increases by the same ratio. At a large disorder of 100 meV, the difference to the previous results is as little as 3%, where the relative disorder time is now 68.1% (instead of 70.8%) at ε = 3 and 17.0% (instead of 19.8%) at ε = 5 . Neither the charge mobility nor the inverse transport time are affected by the updated r σ and their correlation remains. The mobility values discussed for large disorder, μ e and μ h , keep the same values but represent the mobilities at a disorder of 100 meV instead of 70 meV. Figure 4 replaces Figure 5 of the original manuscript. In the figure, only the label for the disorder axis (also in the inset) is re-scaled according to the corrected values for σ. The results about geminate recombination presented are for the large disorder case, i.e. 100 meV instead of 70 meV, but remain unchanged otherwise. The recombination times should be compared with the extracted disorder times, which are t d i s ≈ 3.7 · 10 − 6 s - 2.7 · 10 − 7 s instead of previously 3.8 · 10 − 6 s - 3.2 · 10 − 7 s . Figure 6 of the original manuscript shows the ratio between the number of geminate recombination events and the total number of pairs that can recombine (a) and the 75% time after which geminate recombination occurs (b) for σ = 100 meV instead of 70 meV.

Extensive results reported here for pitavastatin (PVT) and derivatives include the thermodynamic antioxidant descriptors (bond dissociation enthalpy [BDE], adiabatic ionization potential [IP], proton dissociation enthalpy [PDE], proton affinity [PA], and electron transfer enthalpy [ETE]) related to the three antioxidant mechanisms (hydrogen atom transfer [HAT], stepwise electron transfer proton transfer [SETPT], sequential proton loss electron transfer [SPLET]). The particular emphasis is on the PVT's hydroxylated derivatives wherein a hydroxy group replaces a hydrogen atom either on the quinoline core (Q‐hydroxylated metabolites) or on the fluorophenyl ring (F‐hydroxylated metabolites). The calculations indicate that both the Q‐ and F‐hydroxylated derivatives possess antioxidant properties superior to the parent PVT molecule. Given the fact that, to the best of the knowledge, no experimental data for the antioxidant potency of PVT and its hydroxylated derivatives exist, this is a theoretical prediction for the validation of which it is aimed hereby to stimulate companion experimental in vivo and in vitro investigations and inspire pharmacologists in further drug developments.",

The results show that the addition of benzene, 4‐iodoaniline, aniline, and benzenethiol anchoring groups causes a blueshift phenomenon in the absorption spectra of CsMA 2 Sn 2 I 7 perovskite. Furthermore, the involvement of the benzoic acid anchoring group has a minimal effect on the absorption spectra of the CsMA 2 Sn 2 I 7 hybrid perovskites, which show better absorption intensity only in the ultraviolet. The addition of other anchoring groups leads to varying degrees of redshift in the absorption spectra of CsMA 2 Sn 2 I 7 perovskite, which not only enhances absorption intensity but also lends to the improvement of the absorption efficiency in the visible range. In addition, the bandgap can be tuned by applying biaxial strain, which further effectively modulates the absorption intensity of the adsorption systems in different optical bands. Therefore, the selection of suitable anchoring groups has great potential for modulating the photovoltaic performance of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, which is helpful for the application of organic–inorganic perovskites in photovoltaics.",

By enhancing the material compositions and optimizing the structural parameters of conventional fabrics, the creation of radiative cooling fabric that offers both comfort and durability holds great potential. However, the researched simulation models are over‐simplistic, rendering it challenging to precisely portray the fine fabric's structure with the low accuracy of optical properties prediction. In this work, a high‐fidelity model is developed for fabric structure, which allows for precise control of structural parameters of fiber, yarn, texture, and doping particles. Subsequently, by utilizing the FDTD Solutions software, the optical performance of the fabric model is successfully addressed. Furthermore, the coupled heat transfer equation is employed to determine the actual cooling effect of the fabric. It is observed that doping 1% TiO 2 nanoparticles and increasing the number of fibers significantly enhances the solar reflectivity, resulting in a cooling effect of approximately 2 °C. To maintain the skin temperature of 34°C, the additional cooling energy required would be reduced by 36 W m −2 . These findings are expected to provide crucial guidance and predictions for the development of passive radiative cooling fabrics.",

One area, where ML is significantly beneficial is reducing the number of experiments needed to find the optimum combination of parameters in solar cell fabrication. Bayesian optimization (BO) provides routes for quickly identifying optimum parameters in problems with large parameter space. In this work, BO algorithms utilizing previous knowledge are demonstrated to result in faster optimization of tandem solar cells, a technology rapidly gaining more interest due to its potential to deliver record‐high performance. Namely, it is shown that in the space of all possible parameter combinations that take ≈88 years to evaluate, optimum PCE can be obtained in 20 min. Moreover, it is demonstrated that methods utilizing previous knowledge outperform those that do not by yielding an increase of ≈8.9% abs. in the 1st iteration and requiring 5× less time to reach a target PCE of 38.5% across 20 different trials. Results from this work help accelerate the development of tandem solar cells by removing the need for large numbers of experiments in identifying optimum parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although density‐based clustering algorithms can successfully define clusters in arbitrary shapes, they encounter issues if the dataset has varying densities or neck‐typed clusters due to the requirement for precise distance parameters, such as eps parameter of DBSCAN. These approches assume that data density is homogenous, but this is rarely the case in practice. In this study, a new clustering algorithm named ANDClust (Adaptive Neighborhood Distance‐based Clustering Algorithm) is proposed to handle datasets with varying density and/or neck‐typed clusters. The algorithm consists of three parts. The first part uses Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (MulKDE) to find the dataset's peak points, which are the start points for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to construct clusters in the second part. Lastly, an Adaptive Neighborhood Distance (AND) ratio is used to weigh the distance between the data pairs. This method enables this approach to support inter‐cluster and intra‐cluster density varieties by acting as if the distance parameter differs for each data of the dataset. ANDClust is tested on synthetic and real datasets to reveal its efficiency. The algorithm shows superior clustering quality in a good run‐time compared to its competitors. Moreover, ANDClust could effectively define clusters of arbitrary shapes and process high‐dimensional, imbalanced datasets may have outliers.",

The metasurfaces designed for second‐order derivative is a square lattice structure consisting of silicon cylinders surrounded by a silicon dioxide layer. Moreover, another metasurface with a square lattice structure composed of three different silicon cylinders embedded in a silicon dioxide layer is proposed to perform first‐order derivation. To achieve the best performance of the proposed metasurfaces in edge detection, the physical dimensions of the proposed structures are optimized by conducting parametric studies to reach the maximum available numerical aperture . Consequently, the second‐order derivative metasurface attains a numerical aperture with a magnitude , while the first‐order derivative metasurface achieves a numerical aperture of . Finally, the applicability of the proposed structures in optical edge detection is verified in the analog domain.

To detect energy theft more efficiently, this paper proposes an integrated energy systems theft detection (IESTD) based on variational modal decomposition‐maximal information coefficient (VMD‐MIC) and Informer.

In this paper, a lateral driver‐automation driver authority decision method considering the safety of the intended functionality is proposed to improve vehicle driving safety. Based on systems‐theoretic processes analysis, functional safety analysis of driver initiative takeover is carried out to clarify the safety of the intended functionality issues caused by the unreasonable decision. Then, a method for defining the safe driving area is developed to assess the safety level of the driving area around the ego vehicle. Taking the driver‐vehicle state parameters and vehicle–vehicle state parameters as input, a deep neural network model is constructed to determine the intention of the driver to take over the vehicle. The lateral driver‐automation driver authority decision method is designed to make the driver‐machine take‐over decisions, which considers the safety of the intended functionality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated via numerical simulation and hardware‐in‐the‐loop experiments. The results show that the designed method not only improves the control ability of the driver to the maximum extent but also integrates the perception ability of the driver into the vehicle control system to improve further vehicle driving safety.",

These bands contribute to the distinct electronic behavior, rendering Nb 3 Cl 8 a compelling subject for study. In this study, by employing ab initio calculations, the impact of pressure on the electronic properties of Nb 3 Cl 8 is scrutinized, yielding valuable insights. Under high pressures, Nb 3 Cl 8 undergoes a transition from a semiconductor state (with a 1.23 eV bandgap) to a metallic one, accompanied by electronic band restructuration. Notably, the flat energy bands are suppressed with increasing pressure. Furthermore, this investigation underscores the distinctive nature of flat energy bands in Nb 3 Cl 8 , delving into quantum effects, particularly their association with the quantum confinement of electronic states. The confinement of charge carriers in Nb 3 Cl 8 results in discrete energy levels, corresponding to specific orbitals in the density of states, indicating robust electron confinement. Pressure‐induced changes in the energy gap between these quantized levels suggest a decrease in confinement strength. Consequently, the study lays a robust foundation for future exploration, contributing to the development of innovative electronic devices grounded in quantum confinement effects.",

Contact detection is usually the start of wheel‐rail contact calculation, and detecting precision of contact patch center affect accuracy of contact force calculating results, therefore it is significant to improve detecting precision of contact patch center. An alternate search method (ASM) and an extended trace line method are proposed to improve precision and efficiency of contact patch centers detection. The proposed alternate search method applies Golden Ratio Search Method and variable intervals between grids to detect contact patch centers. To make the detected contact patch centers match rail tangential directions better, an extended trace line method is constructed based on geometrical constraints between contact points and rail tangential directions. Dynamic simulations of a bogie vehicle formed by two wheelsets and a bogie frame negotiating a rail curve are conducted to evaluate effects of the proposed methods. Calculating times of the proposed methods for finishing the simulations are compared to explain computational efficiencies of the different methods. The proposed approaches are real‐time capable and can be used for vehicle dynamics simulations.",

Leveraging molecular dynamics simulations, periodic switching of an external electric field enables targeted sorting of amino acids with near 100% precision is demonstrated. Moreover, the velocity of sorting can also be controlled by varying surface charge, the strength of the electric field, and the temperature of the system.

It is found that the solid solutions display the chemical ordering of Ta and Al atoms both residing on the metal sublattice of the material, together with the preference for partial substitution of vacancies for Al atoms.

It is further found that such formation of Al vacancies in (Ta,Al) not only enhances the stability of the solutions but also improves their elastic properties and hardness, both of which could be attributed to the effect of electronic band filling. This investigation indeed sheds light on the interplay between the mixing of Ta and Al atoms and the presence of Al vacancies on the alloying and mechanical behaviors of (Ta,Al), and it thus offers valuable insights for further research and development of these ceramics.",

A random forest machine learning algorithm is developed to predict potential KRAS G12D binders. Molecular docking and the MM/PBSA binding energy are used to identify the lead compounds. The compound NPC489264 is identified as the top candidate, exhibiting favorable docking energy for the KRAS G12D mutant (−13.16 kcal mol −1 ). A hydrogen bond between the mutated Asp12 residue in the KRAS G12D mutant and NPC489264 is found to be a key interaction between these 2 molecules. MD simulations and MM/PBSA analysis revealed the strong binding affinity of NPC489264 to the G12D mutant (−5.49 kcal mol −1 ) compared to the wild type (10.17 kcal mol −1 ).

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium‐ion batteries have been a major energy source in electric vehicles because of their strong adaptability in operating conditions. Accurate estimation of state of charge (SOC) for lithium‐ion batteries can efficiently improve the efficiency of battery energy utilization. However, SOC estimation is complicated in operating conditions with unknown model parameters. This study proposes an adaptive square root central difference Kalman filter (ASRCDKF) algorithm based on the equivalent circuit model to achieve high‐precision estimation of SOC. First of all, to avoid an open‐circuit voltage test, a linear Kalman filter is constructed to realize real‐time estimation of unknown parameters in the measurement equation. Then, to improve the stability of the algorithm, a square root method is used to ensure a positive semi‐definite of the error covariance matrix that is based on the adaptive central difference Kalman filter algorithm. Model parameters are considered as the state to be estimated, and the joint estimation of the model parameters and SOC is realized by an ASRCDKF algorithm. After that, the linear Kalman filter is coupled with the ASRCDKF to realize the accurate estimation of SOC in the case of both the state equation and the measurement equation including unknown parameters. Last, the ASRCDKF algorithm is compared with the adaptive central difference Kalman filter algorithm and the adaptive cubature Kalman filter algorithm under two sets of operating conditions. The results show that the SOC estimation of the ASRCDKF algorithm is more significantly accurate than other algorithms under different operating conditions.",

Groundwater flow is frequently simulated and predicted using mathematical models, such as Darcy's law, which governs the movement of fluids through porous media. Thus, a theoretical analysis of HT is therefore carried out for a time‐independent 3D power‐law (PL) nanofluid (NF) flow on the stretching rotating porous disc near the stagnation region, subject to convective boundary condition, using the MHD, heat source/sink, and thermal radiation effects. A numerical simulation via the Keller Box method is performed using PDEs as the mathematical model for the suggested problem. Investigations are conducted on how several classes of pertinent characteristics affect temperature, velocity, surface drag forces, and HT rate. It has been observed that the radial velocity of the disc increases with an escalation in the permeability of the porous media whereas the azimuthal velocity, however, tends to decrease. Additionally, the rate at which heat is transferred escalates as the radiation and heat source/sink parameter's strength increases whereas it decays along the Prandtl and Biot numbers. Lastly, the present study's results can be applied to understand the thermal impact on seepage of groundwater, geothermal energy extraction, containment systems for landfills and waste, design of subsurface infrastructure, aquifer thermal energy storage, and impact assessment against climate change.",

To establish the governing principles and quantify the observed behaviors, a detailed computational investigation is conducted into the electronic, vibrational, structural, and optical characteristics of K 4 Xe 3 O 12 , utilizing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The calculated elastic constants adhere to Born's criteria, affirming the mechanical stability of trigonal K 4 Xe 3 O 12 , with a bulk modulus (B o ) of ≈53.93 GPa.

Using the Tran‐Blaha‐modified Becke‐Johnson (TB‐mB) potential alongside traditional generalized gradient approximation (GGA) approach, a bandgap of ≈1.32 eV is determined. Rapid fluctuations in optical properties also suggest a propensity for photodecomposition in the visible spectrum.

It is found that the penta‐HgO 2 sheet is semiconducting with an indirect bandgap of 1.18 eV and possesses a low lattice thermal conductivity of 2.07 W m −1 K −1 (3.28 W m −1 K −1 ) along the x ( y )‐direction at 300 K.

The phonon dispersion, phonon scattering, and phonon coherence is further systematically investigated to understand the underlying physics. This results suggest that the strong intrinsic anharmonicity resulting from its unique atomic configuration with the buckled structure and the heavy element of Hg leads to a high scattering rate, resulting in the ultralow particle‐like thermal transport of 0.20 W m −1 K −1 (0.01 W m −1 K −1 ) in the x ( y )‐direction, while the narrow average frequency interval and strong phonon linewidth are responsible for the dominant coherent thermal transport and non‐monotonic variation of the low lattice thermal conductivity of the penta‐HgO 2 sheet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aiming at an efficient method to determine the transport properties of a physical system, an effective and accurate band‐counting algorithm is presented to extract the transmission spectrum of a low‐dimensional system, directly from the band structure. This approach is more efficient than Hamiltonian‐dependent formalisms such as the standard Green's function (GF) or the transfer matrix methods. The only constraint of the approach is that the bands should not be mixed, i.e., for each band in the k ‐path, there should be a set of eigenvalues. The efficiency of the approach is comparable to that of Green's function method, and it is applicable to any computational approach whose output is a band structure, whether for particles or quasiparticles such as electrons and phonons. Since the transport coefficient is calculated separately for each band, the occurrence of eigenvalues at the same k ‐point can be captured by the algorithm. The proposed algorithm will be useful for studying transmission coefficient‐dependent quantities, such as thermoelectric‐related quantities, and also the electric current within the Landauer–Büttiker formalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The primary goal of this study is to create a wavelet collocation technique that can be used to solve nonlinear fractional order systems of ordinary differential equations, which are equations that arise in modeling problems related to auto‐catalytic chemical reactions. Using the Hermite wavelet collocation method (HWCM), the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations of integer and fractional order is numerically solved. The nonlinear Brusselator system is transformed into an algebraic equation system using the collocation method and the fractional derivative operational matrices. The Newton‐Raphson method is used to solve these algebraic equations, and the approximate values of the derived unknown coefficients are substituted. Through the numerical examples, the method's computational effectiveness and correctness are illustrated with various model constraints. A numerical comparison is made between the current approach ND solver, RK method, and Haar wavelet method (HWM). The efficiency and reliability of the developed strategy's performance are shown in graphs and tables. The created Hermite wavelet collocation method is resilient and has good accuracy compared to current methods found in the literature.

    "abstract": "Abstract Actin is highly conserved and contributes to numerous cellular activities. Profilin, one of actin binding proteins, promotes the exchange rate of nucleotide of actin, which leads to a fast elongation of actin filament. To slow down the elongation of filament, chivosazole A (ChivoA) is developed as an inhibitor of blocking actin‐profilin interaction. Intriguingly, known from the solved crystal structure, ChivoA does not bind on the interface between actin and profilin. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to study the possible mechanism how ChivoA inhibits actin‐profilin interaction. First, principal component analysis and representative structures comparisons reveal that the conformation of ChivoA‐bound actin is restrained at a closed state, whereas a trend toward an open state is found in profilin‐bound actin. Then, Peptide Gaussian accelerated MD shows that ChivoA limits the ability of the DNase I binding loop (D‐loop) swings and enlarges a distance between two major profilin binding regions. On the contrary, the distance between these two regions of profilin‐bound actin decreases in a clamp‐like motion mode. Finally, binding energies are calculated by molecular mechanics/poisson‐boltzmann surface area method and display that the ChivoA‐bound actin is less favorable for profilin binding.",

Clarifying the mechanism of the work function reduction is important in developing alternative materials with higher stability. In this paper, a PEI thin film coated on a ZnO layer using all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations is analyzed. The simulations show that the entire PEI thin film induces an electrostatic potential shift of 0.30 eV, whose magnitude and sign are in good agreement with experiments. Further analysis reveals that there are two electric double layers (EDLs) at the ZnO/PEI interface and PEI/vacuum surface and that the latter plays a major role. The coil‐shell conformation of PEI at the PEI/vacuum surface forms the outer EDL and reduces the work function. At the ZnO/PEI interface, on the other hand, the coil‐shell conformation is less dominant because of the Zn‐N interaction and the inner EDL causes a small increase of the work function. This dual EDL model is different from the single EDL model for self‐assembled monolayers in that polymer conformations are essential. The report clarifies the novel polymer‐specific mechanism of work function reduction and opens up the possibility of new cathode modifiers.",

First, through DFT calculations, essential HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital), LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital), and Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) electronic attributes are meticulously dissected providing insights into the intricate charge transfer processes between the constituent donor‐acceptor moieties. Furthermore, MD simulations are employed to unveil the molecular system's multifaceted conformational flexibility and stability. The Root‐mean‐squared deviation (RMSD), end‐to‐end distance, and torsional angles quantitative analysis of conformational attributes support the carbon‐bridged oligo‐phenylenevinylene (COPV) molecular wire's ‐skeleton planar and rigid conformation. This minimal end‐to‐end distance variation (within Å) compared to the initially extended structure and the constrained torsional motion (within for ZnP‐COPV and for COPV‐) after thermalization showcases COPV's ability to maintain structural rigidity over time, aligning with the concept of effective ‐conjugation. Finally, through the lens of time dependent (TD)‐DFT, the dynamic evolution of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, TD‐DFT excitation energies and oscillator strengths are explored as the molecular structure transforms over time. The observed energy gap variation underscores the molecule's adaptability in the face of structural modifications, hinting at an intriguing connection between structural stability and enhanced electronic properties. The research provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between conformational dynamics and electronic attributes in organic semiconductors, providing quantitative insights crucial for designing stable, high‐performance materials for cutting‐edge optoelectronic applications and helping advance the collective understanding of sustainable energy conversion.",

These calculations reveal that all these materials possess a cubic lattice structure and are both dynamically and mechanically stable. Interestingly, they all exhibit indirect bandgaps, except displays a metallic character. The bandgap values for these compounds fall within the range of 3.63 to 5.14 eV. Additionally, the results of the BSE indicate that they exhibit exceptional absorption capabilities across the near‐UV to mid‐UV light region. Furthermore, studies on transport and excitonic properties suggest that they exhibit lower effective electron masses compared to holes, with exciton binding energies spanning between 0.16 and 0.98 eV. A significant observation is the prevalent hole‐phonon coupling compared to electron‐phonon coupling in these compounds.

Various metrics are currently used to measure the degree of coalescence in atomistic simulation studies, such as the radius of the neck formed between the NPs’ centers of mass, gyration radii, sphericity, and surface area changes. A common characteristic of such metrics is that they typically require additional, often painstaking, data manipulation. Here, a new descriptor is introduced, the Overall Reduced Change in Potential Energy (ORCiPE) between initially uncoalesced and coalesced configurations. To benchmark the descriptor, its definition is analogous to that of the Overall Change in Surface Area, a common and dependable metric. When no phase transition occurred, comparison with other metrics confirms the reliability of ORCiPE in coalescing Au NPs. Considering that potential energy is a standard output property in atomistic simulations, ORCiPE is proposed as a valuable and facile coalescence metric.",

Existing CFD code is significantly modified to allow for parallel asynchronous execution.

In this research a computer code for simulation of 2D flow of water through the axisymmetric channel is used as a base for development. The parallel code is executed on GPU, single, and multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU), and the execution times are compared between platforms. Even though that Jacobi solver performs worse on single core computers, compared to its Gauss‐seidel counterpart, it is used to provide a baseline for comparison. In this work, it is shown that computation on finer grids takes less time on GPU than on CPU. The computation time increase with the number of cells in grid on GPU should follow the observed linear trend until the GPUs physical limitations are reached depending on memory size and core count.",

This theoretical approach is used for the examination of a given La 0.7 Sr 0.3–x Sm x Mn 0.95 Ni 0.05 O 3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) manganites. Initially, the critical exponents (𝛾; 𝛽) of these compounds are estimated. It has been noted that the magnetic behavior of the examined materials near the phase transition deviate from the standard patterns observed in typical universality classes. Subsequently, these exponents are exploited to simulate the isothermal curves under higher magnetic fields. The predicted relative cooling power values reach 420.3, 415.7, 412.5, and 408.4 J.kg −1 K −1 under 10 T applied magnetic field for La 0.7 Sr 0.3–x Sm x Mn 0.95 Ni 0.05 O 3 with x = 0, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15, respectively.",

In this work, the stability of the insulin dimer is investigated in the presence of [Cho]‐based ILs containing three distinct anions (i.e., acetate [OAc], taurate [Tau], and geranate [Ger]). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations explore insulin's stability and structure in the presence of ILs. MD analyses reveal that the insulin dimer is stabilized by non‐covalent interactions, with hydrogen bonds and anions in ILs playing key roles. Among them, [Cho][OAc] ILs show significantly better stabilization than other anions.This is due to the hydration patterns of acetate anion, which can be compared to Hofmeister series and chemical agent effects (i.e., kosmotrope and chaotrope). Further, non‐covalent interactions index and electron density analyses from the atoms‐in‐molecules theory approach are carried out to quantify the strength of non‐covalent interaction in ILs with water clusters (Wn, n = 0–6). Analyses show the significance of water molecules in the stabilization of insulin dimer in the presence of [Cho]‐based ILs. The study elucidates the role of ILs formulation concerning insulin dimers to improve the transdermal and oral drug delivery systems.",

The study aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of solving the underlying differential equations that describe these phenomena by utilizing the proposed technique. The financial crime model is a nonlinear coupled system of ordinary differential equations. Using the Gegenbauer wavelets, the novel operational matrices of integration are created. A nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations are transformed into a system of algebraic equations using the characteristics of the Gegenbauer wavelet expansions and the operational matrix of integration, which speeds up processing. Then, this system of algebraic equations is solved using the Newton‐iterative technique to find the unknown Gegenbauer coefficients that help to obtain the approximate solution for the system. A numerical illustration is presented to show the efficacy and precision of the approach. The numerical results obtained from the projected approach are compared with the existing methods, such as NDSolve and Runge Kutta methods. These results show that the projected scheme is simple, reliable, and resilient. The findings suggest that this approach can be a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners in the financial sector, aiding in developing crime prevention and intervention strategies.

In this work, doping with non‐transition metals (M@ systems; M = Na, Mg, Al, and Si) and nonmetals (X@ systems; X = B, C, N, and F) is proposed to modify the electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer. Pristine monolayer is a 2D insulator with a large bandgap of 4.40(6.08) eV obtained from standard(hybrid)‐based calculations. The monolayer is magnetized with total magnetic moments of 3.00, 2.00, and 1.00 upon doping with Na, Mg, and Al metals, respectively. In these cases, magnetic properties are produced mainly by O atoms around doping sites. Meanwhile, Si doping induces no magnetism in monolayer, preserving its nonmagnetic nature. However, the bandgap suffers from a large reduction of the order of 22.27%. The monolayer magnetization is also achieved by doping with B, C, N, and F atoms, where total magnetic moments of 3.00, 2.00, 1.00, and 0.97 are obtained, respectively. For ‐type doping cases, nonmetal impurities produce mainly magnetic properties, meanwhile, Zr atoms generate mainly the magnetism of F‐doped monolayer. Interestingly, feature‐rich half‐metallic nature (in Na@, Mg@, C@, and F@ systems) and magnetic semiconductor nature (in Al@, B@, and N@ systems) are also obtained. By analyzing Bader charge, the roles of charge loser and charge gainer are confirmed for non‐transition metal and nonmetal impurities, respectively. The results may introduce new 2D materials suitable for spintronic applications.",

The UNiversal CLuster Expansion (UNCLE) is employed to construct high‐probability Li–vacancy configurations and the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to compute energy barriers for representative Li diffusion mechanisms. By fitting a cluster expansion model to these barriers, diffusion barriers are determined for all possible Li–vacancy configurations within a nearest‐neighbor approximation. Based on this description, Li‐concentration‐dependent diffusion coefficients are predicted for the entire Li‐concentration range. For the Li x NiO 2 crystal lattice, the computed Li chemical diffusivities well lie within experimental ranges, namely 10 – 10 cm 2 s −1 , at room temperature with activation energies around 37.9 kJ mol −1 . The maximum diffusivity of 4.23 × 10 cm 2 s −1 is identified at x = 0.63. The new analytical, self‐consistent approach here relies on configurational samplings of individual atomistic mechanisms and can be applied to investigate diffusion properties in further dilute and concentrated alloy systems more efficiently than common numerical procedures.",

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, the biphasic behavior of Cyanex301 in water–toluene binary solvents is addressed and compared to that of its two analogs, Cyanex272 and Cyanex302. The simulations shows that deprotonated ligands retard the de‐mixing of the binary solvents compared to their neutral counterparts, but display higher surface activity, and assemble in a more orderly manner at the interface. Increasing their concentrations results in the formation of microtubule‐like structures to maximize their contact with aqueous phase, which is not observed for their native states. The presence of counterion Na + “salts out” ligands and enhances their distribution at the interface. This work complements experimental studies of the ligands with details of their conformations and distributions at the molecular level, and is expected to contribute to the extensive development of their applications in hydrometallurgy.",

A femtosecond laser can drive the electron into Rabi oscillations and prepare it onto arbitrary superposition states between the ground and excited states. After the laser pulse, the electron bubble can exhibit remarkable nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and evolve toward various final states with various lifetimes.

In this case, an absorption ε‐layer is used to terminate the diffusion. Here, based on isomorphism between the electrostatic Poisson problem and the corresponding diffusion motion expectation of the first passage, a new parallel‐plates algorithm is developed without an absorption layer, which induces another diffusion error in addition to the intrinsic Monte Carlo error. As there is not an analytic closed solution for the induced charge density on the parallel plates by a charge at the center between them, a series solution is used, combined with the acceptance–rejection sampling method. Using this algorithm, even though a series solution is used, it is shown that an exact sampling can be performed, which means that the random walk jump can be performed to the parallel planes without using the detailed WOS random walk jumps. It is verified that the proposed parallel plates algorithm is significantly more efficient than the current WOS algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heterogeneous multiscale methods (HMM) capable of simulating asynchronously multiple scales concurrently are now tractable with the advent of exascale supercomputers. However, naive implementations display a large number of redundancies and are very costly. The macroscale model typically requires computations of a large number of very similar microscale simulations. In hierarchical methods, this is barely an issue as phenomenological constitutive models are inexpensive. However, when microscale simulations require, for example, high‐dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) or finite element (FE) simulations, redundancy must be avoided. A clustering algorithm suited for HMM workflows is proposed that automatically sorts and eliminates redundant microscale simulations.

Usually, the focus is on processing and evaluating the data to derive rules or to discover new materials, while less attention is being paid on the strategy to generate the data. In this work, we show that by a sequential design of experiment scheme, the process of generating and learning from the data can be combined to discover the relevant sections of the parameter space. Our example is the energy of grain boundaries as a function of their geometric degrees of freedom, calculated via atomistic simulations. The sampling of this grain boundary energy space, or even subspaces of it, represents a challenge due to the presence of deep cusps of the energy, which are located at irregular intervals of the geometric parameters. Existing approaches to sample grain boundary energy subspaces therefore either need a huge amount of datapoints or a~priori knowledge of the positions of these cusps. We combine statistical methods with atomistic simulations and a sequential sampling technique and compare this strategy to a regular sampling technique. We thereby demonstrate that this sequential design is able to sample a subspace with a minimal amount of points while finding unknown cusps automatically.",

Moreover, in equiatomic domains emerging from initially randomized disorder, an intermediate, entropy stabilized phase is identified with significantly higher magnetic anisotropy energy, being advantageous for miniaturized applications.

This paper explores the relationship between the input and output units of the simplest ANN, a single layer perceptron for the binary classification problem, from the probability point of view. If the feature variables of datasets follow independent normal distribution and outputs are activated by sigmoid function or smooth Relu function, we advocate that the probability density function (pdf) of the output variable is an exponential family distribution. Furthermore, by introducing an intermediate variable, the pdf of the output variable can be written as a linear combination of three normal distributions with same spread but different centers. Based on these results, the probability of the predicted class label can be written as a standard normal cumulative distribution function (cdf). The originality of this paper comes with interesting theoretical results to provide ANNs with a new description of the relationship between input variables to output variables, which can enable ANNs to be understood from a new perspective. Extensive experiments based on one artificial synthesized dataset and ten real‐world benchmark datasets validate the reasonability of those results.",

Here, the numerical simulation way is used to explore the potential of TOPCon technology, focused on the pursuit of higher efficiency. An exhaustive analysis concerning tunnel SiO x and doped polysilicon (poly‐Si) with field passivation effect is carried out to tailor excellent surface passivation. The simulation also suggests that the ultra‐thin SiO x with extremely low pinhole density can suppress the recombination of carriers, thus promoting the passivation quality. Additionally, simulation research is conducted on the potential of using poly‐SiO x (n + ) as the doped layer, and an efficiency of 27.60% is realized via adjusting the optimal band gap and dopant concentration. Briefly, this work presents a comprehensive computational analysis of the tunnel oxide, doped layer and their synergistic impacts on the final performance.",

Then, the difference between the states of the nominal system and the attacked system is explicitly calculated such that the impact of FDI attacks on the STMPC systems can be quantitatively analyzed. And finally, an efficient and effective algorithm to realize the desired FDI attack is proposed, and in order to maintain the flexibility of the attacker, the designed FDI attack algorithm is developed under different attacking scenarios, including attacking a single control node at each sampling time and attacking multiple control nodes each time. Finally, two simulation experiments are carried out based on a robot system and a cart–damper–spring system to verify the efficacy and optimality of the designed FDI attack strategy.",

In this work, the thermoelectric performance of Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 single crystal by using density functional theory is investigated. The optimal carrier concentration ( n ) of Mg 3 SbBi is 2 × 10 19 to 3 × 10 20 cm –3 at 100−700 K. At the n of 3 × 10 19 cm –3 , it can exhibit a high average zT of ≈1.27 at cold‐side temperature ( T c ) of 300 K and hot‐side temperature ( T h ) of 700 K, and the electrical transport performance can be further improved by increasing the n . When the optimal n is reached, the maximum average zT of Mg 3 SbBi at T c of 100 K and T h of 300 K can be up to 0.54, which is comparable to that of state‐of‐the‐art Bi 2 (Te,Se) 3 . Because the decreasing trend of the optimal n with temperature, the maximum low‐temperature thermoelectric performance is easier to be achieved by less extrinsic doping. This work reveals the great potential of Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 single crystal for thermoelectric cooling or power generation, which is expected to provide useful guidance for thermoelectric devices.",

They randomly choose direction which they strictly follow. According to previous results, the dynamic behavior of the beetle rolling dung ball is essentially defined by the complexity of the surface. The typical real surface is combined from a universal scale invariant (fractal) component and another component having a well‐defined characteristic scale. If the transported dung ball has a size comparable with the dimensions of peculiarities of the surface, it strongly influences the motion trajectory. On the flat terrain and at the absence of competitors, beetles manage to roll the ball along a nearly perfect straight path. However, even if the beetle is alone, on a more realistic terrain, the motion is more complex. The motion becomes much more complicated in the realistic situation, when the beetles complete for the balls. In this study, a numerical model is developed which combines 1) attraction of the beetles to the dung, (2) production of the balls of different sizes depending on the size/fitness of the animals, 3) the ball transportation on complex terrains, and 4) the competition between the beetles for already existing balls. A strong correlation between typical radius of the ball and the size of the relief minimums and the results of the competitions, as well as possible optimal strategies of the beetle behavior are found.",

Unfortunately, control over vacancies remains challenging with current preparation methods, motivating the search for new synthetic approaches that will allow for the prescription of specific vacancy configurations. Here, density functional theory is augmented with alloy cluster expansion to examine the structure and zero kelvin enthalpy of millions of structures across composition and pressure space. The results are used to examine how extreme pressures might be used to access novel ordered and disordered phases of ZrC, many of which have been calculated to be thermodynamically stable yet remain synthetically elusive. High pressure is shown to significantly reduce sub‐stoichiometry and drive the system toward fully stoichiometric ZrC. They examine the root of these changes and find that pressure exerts an influence over the distribution and abundance of specific nearest‐neighbor vacancy pairs. These results suggest that pressure is a powerful tool for the control of vacancies, and can offer a new synthetic handle on the bulk properties exhibited in this industrially important class of materials.",

After a brief review of the power generation mechanism, a capacitance‐fitting model of the RS‐TENG spherical electrode is proposed. By using the energy principle and differential equations of equivalent circuits, an electromechanical coupling model is established by considering the nonlinear variation in the dielectric sphere rolling angle. Using the harmonic balance method (HBM), the dynamic output characteristics of the RS‐TENG are analytically solved. Numerical integration and dynamic tests are used to verify the accuracy of HBM results. By comparing the changes in the RS‐TENG output performance with and without the nonlinear effect, it is shown that the model proposed in this study can effectively avoid the underestimation of the operation bandwidth (a relative increment of 43%) and overestimation of the maximum power density (a relative decrement of 32%), and significantly improve the accuracy of the RS‐TENG performance estimation. The influence of design parameters on the dynamic output characteristics of the system is discussed.

Most precisely, the PML is implemented by the auxiliary differential equations method. By applying the proposed scheme to a 3D electromagnetics simulation, the proposal can utilize the unconditionally stable algorithm, one‐step leapfrog formulation, and higher‐order concept in terms of attenuating low‐frequency propagation waves, enhancing the performance, and improving the computational efficiency. Numerical examples including the magic‐T waveguide model, very large‐scale integration circuits, and the structure of metamaterials are investigated to further demonstrate the efficiency, performance, and unconditional stability. The results help conclude that the proposed scheme can attain better performance and efficiency when the time step far surpasses the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy limit.

All the previous last‐passage algorithms can compute charge density at a specific point on a flat or spherical conducting surface only.

In order to content the needs of group users, the current group recommendation algorithm mainly uses users’ consensus preferences instead of personal preferences for group recommendation, which can only content the preferences of most users and ignore the preferences of a few cold users. In order to improve the fairness of group recommendation, a group recommendation algorithm based on dividing subgroups is proposed. The algorithm introduces the comprehensive trust between users to divide the group into different subgroups, and obtains the initial subgroup recommendation list according to the average strategy. The PageRank idea is used to set the weight of subgroups and assign the number of recommended items to subgroups to generate the group recommendation list. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can content the user's personalized recommendation needs to the greatest extent under the premise of improving the group fair recommendation service.",

With the aid of the control variable method, orthogonal experimental design, and stepwise linear regression method, a numerical simulation study of the deposition process of aerosol particles on the surface of a PV module is carried out in this paper. The influence laws of inflow wind velocity ( v ), particle diameter ( d ), installation angle ( α ), and particle concentration ( c ) on the deposition process of aerosol particles are analyzed, respectively. The deposition mechanism of aerosol particles on the surface of the PV module is disclosed, and the prediction model of deposition rate ( n ) is proposed. The results show that v , d , and c all positively affect n of the aerosol particles within the value ranges of each investigation variable in this study. α positively affects n of the aerosol particles when v is less than 3.65 m s −1 . α negatively affects the n of the aerosol particles when v is larger than 3.65 m s −1 . The prediction model could accurately predict the n of aerosol particles.

The model is applied to four different types of phagocytic objects: a flat surface, a microsphere, a microdisk, and a population of microspheres. For the flat surface, the model assumes that a phagocyte maximizes its contact area between the flat surface and minimizes its non‐contact surface area under a constraint exerted by the volume of the phagocyte's cellular contents. For any of the other three types of objects, the model assumes that a phagocyte completely phagocytoses the object(s) by exhausting its available membrane area. It also assumes that the post‐phagocytosis phagocyte minimizes its surface area. Moreover, the volume of the phagocyte's cellular contents and the geometry of the object impose constraints on the model. For each case, two governing equations are established and combined to derive a single explicit equation with the phagocyte's phagocytic capacity as a function of other parameters. The equations are applied to experimental data for macrophages and neutrophils in the literature. Methods for extending the model and experimentally testing it are discussed.",

The calculated results show that B‐doping has a greater effect on Si(100)‐7 than P‐doping. For 0.5 mol% P‐doping, the population difference between Si5─P bonds and Si5─Si3 bonds is 0.02. For 0.5 mol% B doping, the bond population of Si5─B is 1.8 times that of Si5─Si3 and the structure fluctuates greatly. The migration of a single Li atom from V and B sites on the structure's surface to an orthotetrahedral site inside the structure is simulated. Simulation results show that with the increase of P doping concentration from 0 to 1.0 mol%, the Li diffusion rate is ordered as 0.5 mol% &lt; 0 mol% &lt; 1.0 mol%. Furthermore, the ab initio molecular dynamics method is used to simulate the diffusion of multiple Li atoms in P‐doped Si(100)‐7. When the simulation time is longer than 0.09 ps, the Li diffusion rate is ordered as 0.5 mol% &lt; 0 mol% &lt; 1.0 mol%.

Employing the tight‐binding method in conjunction with non‐equilibrium Green's function techniques and Landauer formulas, the impact of various parameters on thermoelectric performance is explored. These findings reveal that the electrical conductivity and, consequently, the power factor exhibits an increasing trend with expanding ribbon length and width. This behavior can be attributed to heightened collision rates, particularly in narrow ribbons, induced by line edge roughness as length increases. Remarkably, the Seebeck coefficient at the Fermi energy corresponding to the maximum power factor remains nearly constant across different widths, lengths, temperatures, and transport regimes. Furthermore, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) demonstrates a positive correlation with both ribbon length and width. In narrow widths and lengths ≈1000 nm, the power factor and figure of merit exhibit an upward trend with ribbon width. However, with further increases in ribbon width, the influence of line edge roughness on thermal conductivity diminishes. Consequently, the figure of merit decreases due to the rise in thermal conductivity. Notably, the thermoelectric figure of merit is higher for short and narrow ribbons and long and wider ribbons.",

To increase the rate of convergence, the selected error transformation function is a arctangent function. The utilization of dynamic surface control method aims to decrease computational complexity by mitigating the need for repetitive differentiation of virtual signals in the conventional backstepping algorithm. In the meantime, the non‐power approximate signals of fuzzy neural network algorithms are utilized to replace the system uncertainties, effectively addressing the passivity issue associated with time‐delayed channels. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results are present to verify that the synchronization error can converge to a small neighborhood around zero in the fast finite time and the closed‐loop system remains stable.",

It can be corrected using spring‐assisted cranioplasty in which springs are compressed at both ends and inserted into the skull to expand it. Although it has advantages over open surgical techniques the surgical outcome may remain suboptimal due to the interaction of skull, spring and surgical parameters. Therefore, optimizing the surgical outcome in the correction of sagittal synostosis with spring‐assisted cranioplasty requires understanding the interaction of multiple factors. In this study, the interrelations between the surgical outcome and skull, spring and surgical parameters in sagittal synostosis treated with spring‐assisted cranioplasty are investigated. Two different statistical shape models are used to simulate skull correction with spring‐assisted cranioplasty. Forty samples for each parameter are generated randomly and spring‐assisted cranioplasty are simulated in finite element models using the combinations of the parameters. Linear regression analyzes revealed that the elastic modulus of the bones and bone thickness have significant effects on the post‐operative cranial index in sagittal synostosis after spring‐assisted cranioplasty. Therefore, quantifying the mechanical and geometric properties of a skull and planning the surgery accordingly may ultimately improve surgical outcomes in sagittal synostosis corrected with spring‐assisted cranioplasty.",

This primary bottleneck results in rapidly increasing power consumption, heating, and associated reliability/scalability challenges as more devices are packed into a small footprint. Despite significant efforts from the device community, a suitable sub‐thermionic alternative is yet to emerge. In this work, an attempt is made to understand the physics of Schottky barrier FETs demonstrating SS &lt; 60 mVdec –1 , as evident in some experimental results. Employing the in‐house TCAD tool, the electrostatic potential in the device is accurately modeled with the sweeping gate bias. Next, the Tsu–Esaki model is used to compute the tunneling current. The analysis shows that the steep SS results from an abrupt change in the tunneling barrier profile, from a step‐like to a triangular‐like. However, in the ON regime, the drift component begins to dominate the transfer characteristics. Thus, the subtle interplay between the drift and tunneling components of transport leads to SS &lt; 60 mVdec –1 in OFF‐state with improved in ON‐state. Finally, using the calibrated model, the performance metrics of an all‐2D material‐based CMOS inverter operating at a low VDD ≈ 0.6 V are projected.",

However, the formation of mixed CH 4 ─CO 2 hydrates during CH 4 ─CO 2 exchange in NGHs reduces the rate of CH 4 ─CO 2 exchange in NGHs. It is reported that molecular level insights into CH 4 ─CO 2 exchange in NGHs using quaternary‐gas systems of CH 4 , CO 2, and a mixture of flue (H 2 S and N 2 ) and noble (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) gases in heterogeneous medium using molecular dynamics simulation techniques.

The results show that Ar enhances CO 2 sequestration in NGHs in the presence of H 2 S rather than N 2 . The hydrate growth occurs due to the formation of dual hydrate cages. Among the methane molecules released from the hydrate slab in a binary‐gas (CH 4 ─CO 2 ) system, &gt; 60 % of the released methane molecules reform new cages beside the interface.

In this research, 20 drug compounds are examined using docking to identify potential drugs that can bind at the common level of the RBD‐ACE2 complex and compared the results with two standard drugs offered (Favipiravir, Arbidol). Among 20 drugs, Ozanimod and Prazosin are selected as the best drug compounds by reviewing the docking scores and drug interaction with the active position of RBD‐ACE2. The results of molecular dynamics simulation showed that Ozanimod with binding energy of −14.24 kcal mol −1 has a higher binding capability than Prazosin with binding energy of −9.55 kcal mol −1 to block the interaction between spike protein RBD and human ACE2 enzyme. Ozanimod effectively binds to the S‐protein RBD and inhibits residues critical to the spike and ACE2 protein interaction. This drug compound is expected to be a potentially effective inhibitor of the interaction between the S‐ RBD and the human ACE2 enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Synchronous grouting technology is a crucial aspect of shield tunnel construction. However, understanding the mechanism of slurry diffusion during this process is challenging due to its complexity and invisibility. Existing theoretical models often oversimplify the grouting process and do not account for multi‐stage diffusion mechanisms. By considering the radial penetration of slurry and viewing the diffusion process as the formation of annular pancakes through circumferential filling, a 3D diffusion numerical model is established using the volume of fluid (VOF)‐multiphase flow model in Fluent software. The model's validity is confirmed through calculations based on theoretical formulas and monitoring data from engineering examples. This study uncovers the patterns of slurry diffusion and examines how factors like porosity, grouting pressure, and slurry density impact diffusion radius and segment stress. The findings of this research provide a crucial theoretical foundation for shield synchronous grouting construction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ion mobility‐mass spectrometry (IM‐MS) has recently contributed to the structural analysis of molecules, including supramolecules and proteins, by determining the ion arrival time distributions correlated with the collision cross sections (CCSs), as well as the mass‐to‐charge ratios. However, its application range is still limited owing to the lack of general CCSs simulation methods based on possible molecular conformations. Here, a molecular dynamics‐based conformational search method for simulating CCS distributions using projection approximation is reported. As a case study, the gas‐phase conformations of the sodium adducts of conformationally flexible polyketones with 3,3‐dimethylpentane‐2,4‐dione as the monomer are analyzed. The sodium adduct of the hexamer ( m/z 781.4 for [ 1 + Na] + ) showed a monomodal arrival time distribution, but that of the octamer sodium adduct ( m/z 1033.5 for [ 2 + Na] + ) is multimodal. The conformational analysis indicated an unimodal CCS distribution of simulated [ 1 + Na] + conformations in which the sodium cation is mainly bound at the chain terminal. Conversely, four clusters of conformations are obtained for [ 2 + Na] + based on the Na + ‐coordination sites, which qualitatively reproduced the observed CCS distribution. This approach will extend the utility of IM‐MS for the conformational analysis of flexible molecules in the gas phase.",

Despite the simplicity of spiral microchannels, the lack of predictive models hampers real‐world applications, highlighting the need for cost‐effective computational tools. In this study, four novel data fitting models are developed using linear and power regression analyses to investigate how flow conditions influence particle behaviors within spiral microchannels. These models are rigorously tested under two different flow rates, focusing on a smaller particle representing Salmonella Typhimurium and a larger particle representing bacterial aggregates, aiming for effective separation and detection. A critical parameter, the sheath‐to‐sample flow rate ratio, is either interpolated or extrapolated using the microchannel's aspect ratios to predict particle separation. The models show strong agreement with experimental data, underscoring their predictability and efficiency. These insights suggest that further refinement of these models can significantly reduce research and development costs for advanced inertial microfluidic devices in biomedical applications.

The model integrates diffusion, reactions involving sources, excess buffers, and fluxes, including efflux through leak and SERCA mechanisms.

Quantized intrinsic spin Hall conductivity is observed in the HgX systems. Large intrinsic spin Hall conductivity is found in the systems due to a strong spin Berry curvature accumulation near the triply degenerate points in the Brillouin zone. Calculation shows that the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity for all three HgX systems has stable plateaus, with Mercury Telluride having a maximum width of up to 1.05 eV. The maximum intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of –931/e () is obtained in mercury sulfide, higher than the reported values for spin Hall conductivity and the plateau width in typical topological insulators such as , , and as well as in transition metal pnictides (TaX, X = As, P and N) and transition metal iridates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To ensure a more accurate simulation of the wheel‐rail contact state in vehicle‐track interaction, a non‐iterative contact geometry determination algorithm is proposed. This algorithm decouples lateral movement and roll, independently calculates the minimum wheel‐rail gap on both sides, and overcomes the limitation of simultaneous wheel‐rail contact on both sides. It can be applied to single‐side and two‐side wheel‐rail separation problems. Additionally, by converting track irregularity and rail deformation into the reverse displacement of the wheel, it avoids real‐time calculation of the wheel‐rail spatial position, thereby improving calculation efficiency. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through Universal Mechanism software and field measurements. Subsequently, the influence of the measured wheel‐rail profile, rail cant, and rail gauge on the wheel‐rail contact characteristics is analyzed. Finally, vehicle shaking caused by track irregularity and wheel‐rail contact is examined from the perspective of wheel‐rail matching. The study demonstrates that the non‐iterative algorithm is suitable for online simulation by pre‐processing the contact geometry parameters. When the track gauge and rail cant increase, the distribution of wheel‐rail contact points becomes more concentrated. Furthermore, when the excitation frequency of wheel‐rail matching is close to the track irregularity excitation frequency, it causes vibration amplification, resulting in lateral vehicle shaking.",

Despite advancements in deep learning, challenges such as multimodal complexity, small lesion segmentation, limited training data, and variability in tumor characteristics hinder precise tumor analysis in MRI scans. To address these issues, we propose the Three Way Multi‐Hierarchical Model (3W‐MultiHier) for tumor classification in MRI. 3W‐MultiHier employs a hybrid Capsule‐Transformer UNet (Capsule‐TransUNet) architecture, integrating capsule and transformer networks within the U‐Net framework. This enables the model to capture spatial hierarchies, long‐range dependencies, and global context, ensuring accurate tumor boundary segmentation. The model also incorporates Residual Network Version 2 ‐ Squeeze‐and‐Excitation Network (ResNetV2‐SENet), which excels at extracting complex features through deep hierarchical structures and feature recalibration. Additionally, the Vision Transformer ‐ Transfer Learning (ViT‐TL) pipeline enhances classification accuracy by leveraging fine‐grained hierarchical representations.

In order to protect the humans and animals life's, it is crucial to monitor these harmful gases. Gases like HCHO, N 2 , NH 3 , CO 2 , CH 4 , CO, and SO 2 are dangerous for human health. As a result, gas sensors have been attracted significant interest as a means to effectively detect and adsorb these pollutants. In this study, the adsorption behavior of several common gas molecules on SiB monolayers has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The study focuses on examining the most stable configurations, adsorption energies, charge transfer, and electronic properties of selected gas molecules on the SiB surface. The gas adsorption behavior on SiB monolayers has been considered for use in work function type gas sensors and conductometric sensor devices. The work function of the SiB layer is found to vary between 4.06% and 27% after exposure to the selected gas molecules, indicating its high sensitivity to these gases. The current–voltage ( I – V ) characteristics exhibit distinct responses for different gas adsorptions on the SiB surface, particularly for HCHO, CO, and CO 2 gas molecules. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of SiB to gas adsorption open up possibilities for the improvement of gas sensing devices for monitoring and detecting harmful gases in various environments",

There has been little progress in the computational modeling of these techniques and further improvement is needed in this area. In this paper, a comprehensive computational model is presented for simulating the complete mechanism of direct and plasmonic nanoparticle‐mediated infrared neural stimulation techniques in schematic samples of experimental setups. The simulation process involves three phases: 1) Simulating the light transmission and absorption in setups containing pure water or a gold nanorod solution using developed 3D, time‐independent, and time‐dependent Monte Carlo models, 2) calculating the spatiotemporal evolutions of temperature within the setup using the finite difference method and a presented novel method, and 3) simulating the thermally induced responses of lipid membranes using an improved method compared to existing theoretical models. The model is validated by comparing the computational results with existing experimental data. The effect of the laser pulse characteristics, nanofluid properties, and some other related parameters on the thermally induced membrane responses is investigated. The computational results help to optimize the parameters selection and maximize the overall efficiency of the infrared neural stimulation techniques.",

The set contains the pinwheel and square ice tilings, and thus a range of magnetic ordering and reversal properties are tested. It is found that a simple point dipole model performs relatively well for square ice, but it does not replicate the properties observed in recent experiments with pinwheel ice. Parameterization of the reversal barrier in a Stoner–Wohlfarth model improves upon this, but fails to capture aspects of the physics of ferromagnetic coupling observed in pinwheel structures which have been attributed to the non‐Ising nature of the islands. In particular, spin canting is found to be important in pinwheel arrays, but not in square ones, due to their different symmetries. The authors' findings will improve the modeling of ASI structures for fundamental research and in applications which are reliant upon the ability to obtain and switch through known states using an externally applied field.",

It is interesting to find that B 4 C 4 has a special puckered surface similar to pure borophene and exhibits robust mechanical stability even at extremely high temperature in the molecular dynamics simulation. Its elastic constant in a direction is close to the superstar graphene in 2D materials. Moreover, B 4 C 4 also meets two necessary principles as a photocatalyst, it has proper valence and conduction band positions and a proper indirect bandgap. The optical absorption edge is about 525 nm corresponding a larger range of visible light adsorption than that of g‐C 3 N 4 . Additionally, the carrier mobilities are estimated to be about 800 cm 2 V −1 s −1 of the electron and 40 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 of the hole which shows its excellent photocatalytic performance. Further calculations demonstrate that the H 2 O molecule can be stably adsorbed on B 4 C 4 sheet, only a smaller activation energy is needed and the water splitting can be carried out spontaneously. The nanoribbon structures still maintain good performances for practical applications. Generally speaking, the new monolayer B 4 C 4 is an efficient and promising photocatalyst toward overall water splitting proved by these calculation results.",

Using multiscale computations of subcellular gene expressions and cell population dynamics that are based on first principles, it is shown that cell cycles can self‐organize into periodic stripes in the development of E. coli populations from one single cell, relying on the moving graded nutrient concentration profile, which provides directing positional information for cells to keep their cycle phases in place. Resultantly, the statistical cell cycle distribution within the population is observed to collapse to a universal function and shows a scale invariance. Depending on the radial distribution mode of genetic oscillations in cell populations, a transition between gene patterns is achieved. When an inhibitor–inhibitor gene network is subsequently activated by a gene‐oscillatory network, cell populations with zebra stripes can be established, with the positioning precision of cell‐fate‐specific domains influenced by cells’ speed of free motions. Such information may provide important implications for understanding relevant dynamic processes of multicellular systems, such as, biological development.",

Although simple pillar configurations (lattice, line sequence) work well for size‐based separation of rigid particles, these have a low separation efficiency for circulating cells. The objective of this study is to optimize sequenced microstructures for separation of deformable cells. This is achieved by numerical analysis of pairwise cell migration in a microchannel with multiple pillars, where size, longitudinal spacing, and lateral location as well as the cell elasticity and size vary. This study reveals two basic pillar configurations optimized for deformability‐based separation: “duplet” that consists of two closely spaced pillars positioned far below the centerline and above the centerline halfway to the wall; and “triplet” composed of three widely spaced pillars located below, above and at the centerline, respectively. The duplet configuration is well suited for deformable cell separation in short channels, whereas the triplet or a combination of duplets and triplets provides even better separation in long channels. These optimized pillar microstructures can dramatically improve microfluidic methods for sorting and isolation of blood and rare circulating tumor cells.",

This paper proposes a novel approach of coupled neural network (NN) and cell method (CM) or NNCM for solving nonlinear electromagnetic problems with ferromagnetic domains. While the topologically linear relations of the cell complexes are mathematically assembled through a transformation in the Tonti diagram by the CM, and the constitutive nonlinear magnetic relations are dealt with by partially connected NN for the fast prediction of the permeability distribution inside the ferromagnetic domain. Since the construction of NN is directly related to the grid connections, a partially connected NN structure with a small number of neurons can reduce the computational cost of the training process. By using a compact NN, the proposed NNCM can effectively eliminate the time consuming iterations for determining the nonlinear permeability distribution, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. The NNCM is employed to analyze the transient electromagnetic field distribution inside a cylindrical ferromagnetic core. The results are compared with those obtained by the traditional iterative CM, which determines the nonlinear permeability distribution by lengthy numerical iterations, to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed NNCM.",

This interface-mediated plasticity within the ultrafine δ'/θ'/δ' composite precipitate is expected to solve the origin of strength-ductility conflicts in future Al-Li alloy design.",

    "abstract": "After a year that posed serious and ongoing challenges for many also in the worldwide scientific community, positive news cannot be taken for granted. It is therefore with deep gratitude that we acknowledge that Advanced Theory and Simulations continues to develop well. The number of manuscript submissions has increased nearly fivefold since the journal started in 2018, keeping the editorial office busy with serving so many authors and requesting the help of even more reviewers from the research community around the globe. With the wealth of selected content, the journal's visibility, usage, and citation rate increased further to new record levels (Impact Factor 4,105 in Journal Citation Reports, Clarivate Analytics, 2022). So, we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who was involved. An offspring of the Advanced Materials journal family, an initial focus of Advanced Theory and Simulations (ATS) on materials science topics was to be expected and continues to be nourished. However, the scope was intentionally defined wide enough to include research from all scientific fields, interdisciplinary studies, traditional and emerging methods, and applied as well as fundamental perspectives. And we are happy to see that the research community in various fields is taking up the offer of disseminating their excellent results in a high-level journal dedicated to theoretical methods, modeling, and simulation approaches in all natural science and medicine areas. Table 1 lists recently published work that was most accessed/downloaded in 2021/2022. It reflects the fact that besides work on materials (e.g., organic photovoltaics) and simulation methods (e.g., coarse-graining), studies on such pressing matters as Covid-spreading receive a lot of attention.

Theory Simul. 2022, 5, 2100521 ATS also benefits from its authors presenting their work in creative ways on the journal cover pages. It is tough to prioritize any of these artful graphics, therefore only a few examples of the many impressive cover pages in 2022 can be shown in Figure 1 - please make sure to have a look at the entire gallery that can be found on the journal homepage. Regarding new developments, we would also like to present some technical-editorial features that were implemented in 2022: To enhance transparency of our editorial decision-making process, we introduced a workflow where reviewers of manuscripts at Advanced Theory and Simulations and its sister journals are notified of the editorial decision for manuscripts they reviewed immediately after the decision is made. The other, anonymized, reviewer reports are also shared with them. This gives our reviewers valuable insight into their peers' evaluation of the manuscript and additional guidance as to the journal's standards. The feedback we have received from our reviewers indicates they are appreciative not just of the information provided in the notification but also how it acknowledges the important contribution they make to upholding our stringent requirements. Furthermore, to help standardize data reporting, Wiley-VCH editors have developed data reporting checklists: cover sheets that are a part of our submission process for original research articles. With input from expert researchers, each checklist indicates what we consider the absolute minimum parameters that should be reported in manuscripts for a particular field of research. These cover sheets assist authors to understand data reporting expectations and guide their manuscript preparation, as well as aiding reviewers during manuscript evaluation. Currently, we have checklists available for research involving the performance/stability of solar cells or for batteries and supercapacitors, as well as a \"Machine Learning Data Reporting Checklist\" that obviously is especially relevant for some of the work published in Advanced Theory and Simulations. In the course of this year, these checklists will be published along with the Supporting Information files for all accepted manuscripts. We trust that the research community continues to appreciate the service, and the interesting results that are collected and presented in Advanced Theory and Simulations after careful editorial evaluation and peer-review. And of course, we cannot close this brief editorial without thanking, on behalf of the entire editorial team, those most important for the success of the journal: the authors, board members, and referees. And last but not least, a big thank-you to our readers for their continuous interest!",

Any conflict and its resolution can therefore benefit from insights into trust dynamics. The deployment of computational trust management methods and agent technologies provide promising options. They have already been successfully applied in many domains, while in conflict research (and possible resolution policies) they are rather unexplored. This research paper therefore presents an approach that is based on a formalized, anthropocentric trust management method. It deploys it accordingly in agents’ simulations to obtain new insights into the dynamics of trust in cooperation–conflict interplay, and to enable derivation of strategies for managing societies to drive them toward desired states.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most of the traditional studies based on single event effects (SEEs) favor the analysis of electrical mechanisms of semiconductor devices. Professional simulation software in microelectronics requires researchers to have a solid knowledge of microelectronics theory, and the modeling threshold of the software is relatively high, the simulation speed is slow, and accurate simulation of inter‐particle and particle–material interactions is lacking. SEEs are related to linear energy transfer (LET), in this paper, a method is proposed to obtain LET datas to predict SEEs of particles incident on silicon materials by using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit in combination with a dense convolutional network to accurately and rapidly estimate the energy deposition characteristics of the particles. The proposed network structure has a high prediction accuracy with a mean square error （MSE） of only 1.77 × 10 −4 . Compared with Geant4, which takes 1 min to compute a set of data, the proposed network structure takes only 0.0817 s. The method explores the feasibility of using Geant4 to model semiconductor devices combined with deep learning algorithms, providing a new research perspective for the prediction of microelectronic devices and making it possible to explore the influence of integrated circuits by SEEs.",

A HYSYS simulation is used to calculate the separation costs, a challenge in previous models available in literature. The profitability of a 10 000 kg per day CO 2 electroreduction plant to produce ethanol is studied. An optimization of the pressure swing adsorber and distillation tower, which greatly influence the total cost of the plant (≈20% of total cost), is carried out, obtaining a total cost of separation of £1.9410 6 . The study demonstrates that reducing the voltage applied to values around 0.5 V, i.e., by increasing the pH up to 12 makes the process economically feasible with a current density over 15 mA cm −2 . It also shows that the process is economically feasible using a current density of 5 mA cm −2 if the electricity cost from renewable sources drops to 2.010 −2 £ kWh −1 . Finally, it is proved that if catalyst stability is not considered, some catalysts currently available in the literature can be used with a positive economic income. The results of this research show that the industrial electroreduction of ethanol can be feasible and can attract interest in the industrial adoption of the technology.",

The activation energy is used to describe the energy required to initiate the coalescence. The Lode–Nadai parameter's distributions of the coalesced clusters provide more insight into the loading states on the atoms during different stages. The results show that the two clusters appear to form the neck involving twist and “slip” in the initial stage of the coalescence, and the Ag atoms present significant diffusion along the facets of the Cu cluster.

Kinetic models are adopted to discuss the polarity effect of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) growth at different alloying stages. The models reveal that, before Sn solder is depleted during thermal aging, the net thermodiffusion Cu flux in Cu 6 Sn 5 is over three times larger than that in Cu 3 Sn. While coupling with current stressing, the IMCs thickness increases from parabola‐like curves to a linear‐like relationship. The degree of influence decreases in the order of Cu 6 Sn 5 on anode, Cu 6 Sn 5 on cathode, Cu 3 Sn on anode, and Cu 3 Sn on cathode. Electromigration Cu flux in Sn is the critical factor that accelerates the anode's Cu 6 Sn 5 growth, and its influence on the growth rate over 1000 times that on the anode's Cu 3 Sn. After Sn solder is depleted, Cu 6 Sn 5 gradually converts into Cu 3 Sn, and its thickness is linearly decreases with square root of annealing time. When coupling with a current density of 1.0 × 10 5 A cm −2 , the thickness ratio of Cu 3 Sn/Cu 6 Sn 5 reduces from 1:2 to 1:6. Remarkably, irrespective of whether current exists or not, the depletion of Cu 6 Sn 5 always takes much longer than that of Sn solder.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A double branch fusion network is proposed based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection images to increase the detection accuracy of vital components and defects in transmission lines. The backbone feature extraction network comprises a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Transformer network. To be specific, the CNN should extract local information, and the Transformer network is responsible for the extraction of global information. Besides, global information and local information have semantic differences, while resulting in feature aliasing after fusion. To solve this problem, a multiscale convolution module and a multiscale pooling module are proposed to solve semantic differences and feature aliasing through the interaction between two types of information. In general, the enhanced feature extraction network comprises a residual‐like convolution module, which can reduce the loss of detailed information (e.g., edge contours) and further extract high‐level semantic information from the deep network. Besides, it performs feature fusion in multiple regions in the enhanced feature extraction network, such that the multi‐scale adaptability of the neural network is effectively enhanced. Last, the fused feature information at different scales is decoded, and the final detection results are yielded.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has the potential to address technical challenges that persist in the visualization of optically inaccessible flow fields in integrated systems. However, traditional reconstruction algorithms are unable to reconstruct high‐quality images from dynamic scan data. In this paper, a neural network structure that can reconstruct high‐quality images directly using sinograms as input by combining the filtered back‐projection (FBP) algorithm and denoising convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, which is named FBP‐CNN. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and the Monte Carlo simulation platform are used jointly to generate a dataset for the flow around the bluff body problem. The dataset is then used to train, validate, and test the FBP‐CNN network, and the network after completing training is used to reconstruct the real projection data. The results show that FBP‐CNN can reconstruct high‐quality images from both simulated datasets and real projection data.",

The structural properties of the Fe chains are determined and compared with their bulk structures. The results indicate that in the lowest energy configuration, the wires crystalize in a system that belongs to the space group (No. 131, Z = 2, point group ), with antiferromagnetic arrangement. The stability is determined by calculating the phonon frequencies in the whole Brillouin zone within the supercell approach. The relative stability of the periodic chains is also determined by calculating the elastic properties and comparing them with bulk cases. The band structure, the density of states, the magnetic properties, the anisotropy energy, and topological analysis, performed with the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules approach, are also reported and discussed. The results support the idea that these Fe nanowire systems are promising materials for practical applications, like lithium‐ion batteries.",

The ventilation and pollutant diffusion conditions are investigated under the combined action between the thermal buoyancy force and mechanical wind force. When the thermal buoyancy is uniformly distributed, the upstream vortex gradually occupies the most area of the flow unit with the increase in σ H . Three configurations of green roof systems (roof, leeward, and windward cooling schemes) are assumed to represent different thermal buoyancy distributions in the street canyon. The average air exchange rate and pollutant retention time ( τ ) are proposed to evaluate the ventilation efficiency and pollutant dispersion condition. The “free airflow” phenomenon occurs and gradually expands with the increase in the standard deviation of each model. The flow structure and pollutant distribution inside the urban canopy are similar in the uniformly heated and leeward cooling scheme. The windward cooling scheme presents the least local retention time in most working conditions. The roof cooling scheme aggravates the pollutant accumulation conditions inside the street canyon. This study can provide some constructive guidelines in the urban planning process and benefit the design of urban greening with different building morphologies.",

In this study, the magnetoresistance and magnetic properties of Ni–Fe bi‐segmented cylindrical nanodots in a broad range of diameters and heights are discussed. The power of the First Principles approach, as considered in the density functional theory formulation, is used to study the structural and magnetic relaxation effects, and atomistic simulations, through the Fast Monte Carlo methodology, are employed to explore the magnetoresistance and magnetic behaviors of these systems. By means of the magnetic hysteresis and magnetoresistance signals, convoluted magnetization reversal schemes are discussed. These effects take place depending on the size of the Ni and Fe components as a result of the interplay among exchange interactions and size and shape effects induced by dipolar interactions. Since size has become an experimental controllable parameter, due to the enriched phenomena, the effects discussed in these bi‐component systems are useful for the design and production of devices for technological applications with relevance beyond the observed in the more restricted single component systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanism suggested by Turing for reaction‐diffusion systems is widely used to explain pattern formation in biology and in many other areas. The persistence of patterns in altering environments is an important property in many natural cases. The experimental study of these phenomena can be done in chemical systems using appropriately designed reactors, e.g., in two‐side‐fed open gel reactors. This configuration allows for testing the effect of time‐periodic boundary conditions that generate periodic feeding of chemicals on the dynamics of Turing patterns. The numerical approach is based on a chemically realistic mechanism and a 2D description of the reactor that reproduces the feeding from the boundaries and the corresponding concentration gradients. Depending on the amplitude and the frequency of the forcing, two basic regimes are observed, spatiotemporal oscillations and pulsating spot pattern. In between them, a mixed‐mode pattern can also develop. Spot patterns can survive large amplitude forcing. The dynamics of the spot pulsation are analyzed in detail, considering the effect of the tanks and the chemical gradients that localize the patterns. These findings suggest that periodic feeding effectively controls pattern formation in chemical systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, the effects of point defects on the electronic and magnetic properties of PAs monolayer are investigated. PAs monolayer is stable in a buckled hexagonal structure, exhibiting indirect gap semiconductor character and is metallized under the presence of vacancies due to the dangling bonds around defect sites. Meanwhile, the non‐magnetic semiconductor character is preserved upon creating antisite defects with a negligible variation of the band gap. Significant magnetism as well as feature‐rich electronic properties are induced by p ‐ and n ‐type defects. Specifically, doping with Si and Ge atoms leads to the emergence of the magnetic semiconductor nature. In these cases, the total magnetic moment of 1 is obtained, where dopant atoms are mainly responsible for the magnetization. Besides, doping with Br induce the half‐metallic nature with a total magnetic moment of 2 , where magnetic properties are produced by the dopant and its neighbor due to the strong hybridization. In contrast, weak hybridization is the main reason for the absence of magnetism in the Cl‐doped PAs monolayer. Results presented herein introduce the creation of point defects in buckled semiconductor PAs monolayer as efficient functionalization approaches for optoelectronic and spintronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Single‐stranded DNA (ssDNA) plays a pivotal role in both nanotechnology and various biological processes. Many processes and applications can be better understood with enhanced structural characterization of ssDNA; however, the dynamic nature of the molecule makes accurate characterization with atomistic resolution extremely difficult. This study uses a method that integrates experimental small‐angle X‐ray scatter (SAXS) data and molecular modeling data using a genetic algorithm (GA) to predict an all‐atom conformational ensemble of ssDNA. The results of this study also validate the performance of various AMBER force fields and implicit solvent models for ssDNA. Overall, the results are able to determine the most accurate atomistic representation of poly‐Thymine (polyT) in solution to date that closely matches the experimental SAXS observations enabling a better understanding of the behavior of ssDNA in solution.",

As oxidative stress is due to free radicals, free radical scavenging agents, such as vitamin C, are used in the hope of mitigating the severity of COVID‐19. In this paper an analytical model of free radical encounters within a cell is derived. It computes the effectiveness of free radical scavenging and the subsequent reduction in oxidative damage due to therapeutic intervention of exogenous antioxidants. Various publications make claims of success, albeit modest, treating critically ill COVID‐19 patients with high doses of vitamin C. The findings cast doubt on these claims and challenge the notion that any benefits attributed to vitamin C are due to free radical scavenging.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the full electron–phonon and phonon–phonon interaction effects in semiconductors is crucial for tuning electronic and phonon transport properties with the purpose to the enhancement of thermoelectric performances. In this work, based on the detailed investigations on 2D lead phosphorene (PbP) by using the first‐principle calculations, it is demonstrated that, in , , and PbP, the electron–phonon interactions are significantly stronger than conventional group‐IV monolayers such as silicene by five orders in magnitude, and intravalley scatterings dominate over the intervalley scattering due to less degenerate band extrema near Fermi level. Based on the selection‐rule analysis, it is found that the symmetry breaking in the janus γ phase compared to the higher‐symmetry α phase allows fewer symmetry operations, leading to more allowed scattering channels for electrons and phonons, subsequently suppressing the electron and phonon transport in PbP. Due to the low Debye temperatures, and strong four‐phonon interactions, the lattice thermal conductivities at room temperature in these monolayers are sharply decreased. Finally, it is found that the maximum thermoelectric figure of merits for these three monolayers reach 0.90/0.24/1.25 at room temperature, respectively. This work not only paves the way for the promising applications of PbP monolayers in thermoelectric devices, but also suggests that symmetry breaking and strong high‐order phonon–phonon interactions are crucial to identifying excellent thermoelectric materials.",

A new integral‐type double self‐triggered (ST) model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed by combining a novel ST strategy with MPC, which significantly decreases the sampling frequency of the system, saving computation/communication resources. In contrast to the traditional ST strategy, two integral‐type self‐triggering mechanisms are designed based on the mode of the state and the integral of the difference between the optimal and actual states. In addition, the integral‐type double ST‐MPC algorithm is developed, and the feasibility and stability of the closed‐loop system are rigorously demonstrated. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are verified by comparing the simulation results with those of existing ST‐MPC methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Density functional theory is used to compare the catalytic performance of PtPdRhFeCo(100) high entropy alloy (HEA) three‐way catalyst (TWC) to the conventional Pt(100) in the NO reduction step during NH 3 production that supplies to passive NH 3 ‐SCR. Stronger adsorption of NO on the HEA(100) surface is beneficial to capture NO. During adsorption, the catalyst surface acts as an electron donor while the adsorbate is the acceptor on both HEA(100) and Pt(100) systems. Herein, the reaction mechanism of NO reduction can be classified into two steps: 1) NO activation and 2) product formation. During NO activation, direct NO dissociation is the preferable pathway on both HEA(100) and Pt(100) surfaces with the same E a , whereas HNO and NOH pathways on HEA(100) are suppressed. For NH 3 , N 2 , and N 2 O production on HEA(100) is found to be more difficult than on Pt(100). However, the thermodynamic driving force of all reactions on HEA(100) is more spontaneous than on Pt(100). Also, the rate‐determining step on HEA(100) is found to be NH 3 formation different from the Pt(100), while difficult H diffusion on HEA(100) is the key factor that reduces NH 3 production.",

    "abstract": "The collection of articles featured in this special issue “Computational Materials Science” are meant to showcase the progress in the field of modeling nanocrystal catalysts. Most of the authors featured in this issue are members of COST Action CA18234 “Computational materials sciences for efficient water splitting with nanocrystals from abundant elements”, which is a European network of experts in computational modeling of nanostructured materials and catalysis. The purpose of this action is to connect methods at different length and time scales and integrate all of them within a united framework for modeling the complex features of nanostructured and reactive materials. This special issue presents the current status and the most recent research progress in reaching the ambitious goal of an effective and reliable first-principles and multi-scale modeling for nanostructured catalysts. In the following a short overview of the main results in the collected contributions. 1. Pourbaix diagrams can be used to provide information on thermodynamically stable surfaces under certain conditions of pH and potential U, which is critical for starting building the surface model. In a paper by Kai S. Exner, Francesc Illas, and co-workers (article 2200217), a detailed analysis is provided on how to build the diagrams from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The diagrams for a series of MXenes are provided, including Ti2C, Ti3C2, V2C, and Mo2C with single and double mixed terminations involving O, OH, H, or F surface groups. The Pourbaix diagrams for all explored MXenes exhibit similar trends in the predicted stable surface coverage at different values of pH and U. In aqueous environment, MXenes will not show their bare surface at any pH-U working conditions. The authors have shown that depending on the pH and U conditions, other terminations rather than the typically assumed fully O* or fully OH* covered surfaces should be considered. In particular, the fully H* terminated surface is of importance for U < –0.6 V versus SHE. Mixed surface phases involving –F moieties with –O or –OH groups can also appear such as in the case of Ti2C and Ti3C at strong acidic conditions and slightly negative potentials of –0.6 V < U versus SHE < 0 V, which are of relevance to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). 2. The choice of the approximate XC functional is an important step for modeling oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and HER catalysis. In a paper by Gianfranco Pacchioni and co-workers (article 2200513), the role of the XC functional was demonstrated on single atom catalysis for 16 transition metal atoms embedded in N-doped graphene. The use of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) that is commonly adopted to study single atom catalysis appears acceptable for 4d and 5d metals, while in the case of 3d systems PBE+U or PBE0 approaches are recommended, in particular for magnetic ground states. There is not only a quantitative problem in reproducing the Gibbs free energies, but also a qualitative difference, with some SACs that are predicted to be very active at the PBE level and totally inactive using the PBE0 hybrid functional. 3. What is the best method to address the materials and redox processes for effective oxidation of saltwater? To answer this question, Robert B. Wexler and Emily A. Carter (article 2200592) report a benchmark study based on DFT and least-squares linear regression on the O, Cl, and H chemisorption enthalpy trends and scaling on 3d transition metals, Pd, and Pt in the face-centered cubic (fcc) and their ground-state crystal structures. This work present a wealth of results with different DFT methods on systems that are relevant for seawater electrolysis. Beside the importance of selecting the proper methods to address these materials/processes, the authors prove that the O and Cl chemisorption enthalpies are strongly correlated, suggesting that the transition metals considered will oxidize unselectively water and Cl−. This strong correlation appears also for crystal reduction potentials of binary oxides and chlorides, indicating a fundamental challenge for future seawater electrode materials design. 4. Chemical models of complex processes involve several chemical reactions and parameters that hold some uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis is key tool to quantify and trace this uncertainty to specific input parameters. In this context, Anja Bieberle-Hütter and co-workers (article 2200615) present a work on the implementation and validation of the Sobol's global variance-based sensitivity analysis method, which can be set-up for microkinetic modeling and can easily be applied for different models. Such analysis framework is successfully demonstrated by means of two case studies: CO oxidation and OER at the photoanode in a photo-electrochemical cell. The reported results also highlight the influence of each input parameter on the output uncertainty, for example for the OER the most relevant are the catalyst valence band potential and the solvent reorganization energy. Such approach holds great potential to be integrated with atomistic tools for multiscale modelling of complex catalytic materials and processes. 5. Reactivity at a transition metal surface can be strongly affected by the exposed facets and surface steps. Eugene Kotomin and co-worker (article 2200619) present a first-principles study on photocatalytic activity toward water splitting of strontium titanate SrTiO3 (STO) and how it can be further enhanced on multifaceted nanoparticles. With periodic DFT calculations on water adsorption and proton diffusion the authors report new insights on the thermodynamics of the HER within the framework of computational hydrogen electrode, highlighting how surface morphology can impact catalytic activity toward water splitting, with flat surfaces providing best catalytic activity toward formation of molecular hydrogen. 6. One of the great obstacles for theoretical characterization is how to calculate the activation energy during heterogeneous catalysis. Usually, due to large computational time, calculations of kinetic activation barriers are avoided and catalysis is evaluated based on thermodynamic adsorption energies. In a paper by Nadav Snir and Maytal Caspary Toroker (article 2300182), a new method is suggested for calculating the inner sphere component of the reorganization energy that contributes to the activation energies. The algorithm is based on Marcus theory combined with the climbing image nudged elastic band method, which allows the calculation of the activation energy at different potentials and without simulating solvation in order to obtain the inner sphere component alone arising from the reorganization of the ionic surface. The method is simple to use and can be adopted to evaluate activation energies and to determine the rate limiting step. 7. Multiscale modeling is necessary for more realistic assessment of nanomaterials with subtle structural modifications. José R. B. Gomes and co-workers (article 2200628) presented a review with techniques that range from quantum mechanical approaches based on DFT to classical atomistic and coarse-grained force field methods as well as machine learning. Several material test cases are presented including: MOFs, LDHs, and MXenes. 8. Extended surface models retain the common flaw of lacking proper description of finite-size effects in nanostructure systems. To address this issue, Angel Morales and co-worker (article 2200670) report a relativistic, all-electron, non-periodic DFT study on the interaction between a metal cluster and a metal-oxide nanoparticle substrate. This work provides a neat example on the relevance of large model to describe realistic nanostructured catalysts. The Ru13 cluster supported on an octahedral anatase (TiO2)84 nanoparticle is used as case study. The formation of the metal/anatase heterostructure leads to a decrease of the energy gap inherent to the bare anatase nanoparticle, with the contribution of partially filled Ru 4d orbitals with Kohn–Sham energies in the same energy range of O 2p occupied and Ti 3d empty manifolds. This feature is systematic, no matter the interaction involves the oxide nanoparticle facet or edge regions. This study constitutes a first step in designing a strategy to investigate metal-semiconductor nanostructures using realistic models that go beyond the use of extended surfaces. 9. Multi-ferroic oxides show promising activity as photocatalyst for their peculiar opto-electronic properties: Bismuth Ferrite is the protypical solid of this class of materials, but further optimization of its properties are needed for an optimal catalytic efficiency. Ricardo Grau-Crespo and co-worker (article 2200673) report a DFT study on the BiCoxFe1−xO3 (x = 0; 0.0625; 0.125) solid solutions, with the aim of investigating how Co substitution at Fe site can be useful in engineering the band gap and band alignment, without losing the ferroelectric properties. The results based on bulk and surface DFT calculations and on Monte Carlo simulations of defect interaction and segregation provide a complete overview of the thermodynamic and electronic properties of the proposed solid solutions. 10. Charge transport via interfaces in materials is crucial in comprehending the constraints of many electronic devices, including electrocatalysis. Nonetheless, simulating experimental length scale structures puts a challenge in terms of computational efforts. In the work by Yair Reichman and Maytal Caspary Toroker (article 2300155), several heterostructure systems of typical semiconductors with zinc-blende unit cells were investigated. The study analyzed the correlation between the transmission coefficient of the one-electron wave function to pass through the interface and interface characteristic parameters. As demonstrated for zinc-blende structure materials under strain, the primary conclusion is that the parameters of the material's potential can be used to predict the transmission coefficient of the electronic wave function even when the potential has a complex realistic curvature. Overall, the main results from this collection of papers can be sum up in a simple message: further advances in this field call for improving the accuracy of each method (such as choosing a proper exchange-correlation function in DFT calculations) and, at the same time, combining complementary models at different scales. As the majority of the community is performing DFT calculations with continuous effort, the effective and consistent overlap between DFT and MD simulations is a first good step to improve over standard 0 K DFT calculations. The next pressing issues in catalytic design is to account for the complex nanoscale architecture of heterogeneous functional interfaces along with the necessary solvent environment. Thus, multiscale modeling with mixed methodologies is anticipated to be the required avenue to tackle such ambitious goal. Eventually, as guest editors, we are grateful to all the authors who contributed to this special issue and would like to express our appreciation especially to Dr. Stefan Spiegel, the editor-in-chief of Advanced Theory and Simulations, for providing the platform to demonstrate and showcase the latest progress in computational materials science research from a group of motivated scientists with a strong expertise in the area of nanocrystal catalysis that joined their efforts to build a common COST action network.

The spatial redistribution of electronic charge after illumination shows a strong dependence on the frequency and polarization direction of the laser pulse with a similar pattern for all thicknesses. The comparison of the layer‐resolved changes in occupation of the ground‐state orbitals after optical excitation obtained for Fe n /(MgO) m (001) and bulk Fe reveals the origin of excited carriers in the heterostructures: In the central and interface Fe layers carriers are excited from states in the vicinity of the Fermi‐level to the conduction band of MgO. Simultaneously, excitations take place from the valence band of MgO to Fe states above the Fermi‐level. This concerted mechanism allows for an effective bidirectional relocation of excited carriers between the metallic and insulating subsystems in heterostructures with a thickness of several nanometers, providing an effective accumulation of hot carriers in the insulating layers, even at photon energies in the vicinity and below the bandgap of bulk MgO.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A 3D structural model for fuel cell catalysis systems is constructed, which consist primarily of Pt and CeO 2 nanoparticles, to fit observed small angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) patterns by using the reverse Monte–Carlo (RMC) method. The observed SAXS patterns are well reproduced by those of the simulations. Pore size distributions using the obtained structure models are compared with the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis for the nitrogen gas adsorption data, and the lower quartiles and medians of the pore diameters are reasonably consistent. In addition, analysis of the SAXS patterns indicates that the number of nanometer‐size Pt particles is much smaller than that of the introduced amount. This suggests that most Pt particles are not uniformly distributed in the catalysis system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wide embankments with a width of tens or even hundreds of meters change the settlement distribution mode of soft ground. At the same time, the influence of embankment height on the stability and settlement of soft ground is quite significant. For the wide and high embankments, when the prefabricated vertical drain (PVD) is applied in the middle of the embankment and the cement‐soil mixing pile (CSMP) is implemented on both sides of the embankment, a novel determination approach of the reasonable proportion of the suitable treatment range of the PVD and the CSMP is proposed in this study. Combined with the engineering example of the Sanya Station yard of Hainan East Ring Railway, the Plaxis 2D finite element program is used to carry out the parameter analysis on the different proportions of PVD and CSMP in treatment ranges. It is confirmed that the proportion of the PVD and the CSMP in this project is between 2:3 and 4:1, which is consistent with the final design scheme provided by the design company. The on‐site monitoring results of this site show the effectiveness of the determination approach proposed in this paper.",

The “drumhead‐like” surface states exist on the (001) surface, while surface states possess the exotic single–double conversion, implying that o‐Ti 3 N 2 may process interesting surface transport properties. These features make o‐Ti 3 N 2 a new member in topological materials, with promising novel applications in electronic devices.",

Considering different situations where permittivity and permeability are obtained depending on NCG parameters, in dielectric, nonmagnetic, and magnetic cases, exotic conditions associated with metamaterial properties are obtained as the presence of negative index refraction under a generalized susceptibility depending on NCG. These results show that a class of optical metamaterials can be modeled based on NCG depending on noncommutative parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A model of the scanning‐caused soft sample deformation during atomic force microscope contact‐mode (CM) imaging is developed. CM imaging has been widely used for topography characterization of live biological samples such as live cells. However, due to the intrinsic softness of these samples, the sample surface deformation caused by the probe–sample interaction leads to significant error in the topography images obtained, and damage to the live biological sample. Although the deformation can be reduced by imaging at a rather slow scan rate (e.g., less than 0.2 Hz), such a low‐speed imaging not only is time consuming, but also inevitably induces large temporal error. In this work, the scanning‐caused surface deformation of soft samples is modeled and quantified, including live biological samples in CM imaging. Effects of both the scanning and the coupling between the vertical and the lateral deformation on the deformation are characterized. The proposed deformation model is validated by implementing it to quantify the topography image difference caused by the scanning‐caused surface deformation of live prostate cancer cells imaged at two different (high and low) speeds, respectively.",

However, the previous studies overlooked the fact that it is feasible to alter the quasi‐plasticity of SMAs at the small scale and to tune them according to various factors. Here, the feasibility of altering the quasi‐plasticity of microscale SMAs with the direction of applied stress and of tuning them according to the volume ratio of crystalline structures is reported. To achieve this, the dynamic model for SMA is developed and their quasi‐plastic behavior, including phase and crystalline structure transformations, is simulated. The simulation reveals that it is feasible to select the crystalline structure of SMA according to the direction of the applied stress and, more critically, to tune the quasi‐plastic deformation by varying the volume ratio of crystalline structures by up to approximately 600% (i.e., 0.8–5.3%). This study highlights the practical tunability in the design of small‐scale SMA‐based systems.",

We claimed that “(the journal) will expand the well-established Advanced brand of journals by providing a new platform for bringing together the underlying theoretical aspect of research areas in the general fields of materials science and natural sciences.” And we also stated that we “aim for publishing excellent results from a broad scope of research areas.” Now that nearly twelve months have passed, it does not seem too presumptuous when stating that these goals indeed have been reached. Starting in January 2018, we have published issues on a monthly basis, with an increasing number of articles (and an increasing number of submissions), covering a broad range of topics, and authored by leading experts in the respective fields. An overview of the most accessed articles from 2017/2018 can be found in Table 1, with topics including microelectronics, semiconductors, micellization, nanomechanics, CO2 reduction, resistive switching, and metamaterials—to only name a few. Another topic of growing interest is the field of machine learning and deep learning, and we have recently launched a virtual issue collecting articles published in Advanced Theory and Simulations that highlight outstanding work in these areas. More details can be found in the special features section of the journal homepage (http://www.advtheorysimul.com). “Given the advancements in simulation across all disciplines, it is almost mandatory to have a journal in which new innovative concepts and evidence-based applications can be presented and discussed. Advanced Theory and Simulations is the journal that meets these demands and I am sure it will be one of the international promoters for conceptual progress in complexity and simulation studies.” Ortwin Renn, Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, Potsdam “Theory and Simulation are now essential to virtually every field of scientific research. Advanced Theory and Simulations fills an important need in providing a new and excellent forum that showcases cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in these areas.” Leeor Kronik, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovoth “Having been an ardent supporter of Advanced Materials since its launch 30 years ago and having participated in its diversification early with Advanced Functional Materials, it is with great enthusiasm that I welcomed the extension of the Advanced family to Advanced Theory and Simulations. ATS is quickly establishing itself as a premier location for materials-oriented theoretical conceptual advances and computational applications.” Jean-Luc Brédas, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta “Advanced Theory and Simulations offers an innovative platform where the synergy of theoretical concepts and efficient algorithms qualifies simulation as a self-standing interdisciplinary field of high impact in modern science.” Luigi Delle Site, Freie Universität Berlin The journal also benefits from impressive cover designs provided by our authors. Of course, it's a matter of taste which of the covers you like best, but I trust that the selection provided in Figure 1 presents a nice overview of the different successful approaches to visualize scientific achievements and, thereby, also attracting additional attention for the presented research as well as for the journal. Last but not least, and on behalf of the entire editorial team, I would like to thank all those who made the impressive development of Advanced Theory and Simulations possible: a dedicated and truly interdisciplinary editorial board (some of its members were kind enough to share their thoughts via the quotes cited in this Editorial), our authors and referees who submit their research results and help to select and publish the best content—and of course our readers for their continuous interest. We hope that you have enjoyed the first year as much as we did and are looking forward to accompanying the journal on its way into an exciting future! Stefan Spiegel (Editor-in-Chief)",

Starting from the time‐ordered Hamiltonian for the phase of the current which flows across the junction, the propagator, the wave functions, and the joint entropy, which are crucial for quantum analyses of the nano systems, are derived. It is shown that while the propagator and the wave functions vary depending on external driving forces, the joint entropy is not affected from such forces. Interestingly, the probability densities oscillate over time on account of the influence of the time‐varying supercurrent in the junction. It is confirmed that if external perturbations on the junction‐current are more complicated, the time behaviors of the probability densities become conspicuously irregular. The properties of the joint entropy are also analyzed in detail. Due to damping of the system, the phase(ϕ) component of the joint entropy decreases linearly over time, whereas the conjugate momentum( q ) component exhibits linear increase; however, the corresponding joint entropy consequently does not vary. It is demonstrated that the joint entropy obeys the quantum minimum principle, and that there is a close relationship between the joint entropy and the uncertainty relation.",

In article number 1700018, Bin Wen and co-workers systematically investigate the electronic and topological properties of o-Ti3N2 with a combination of first-principles calculations and Wannier tight-binding analysis. The analysis suggests that o-Ti3N2 may possess interesting surface transport properties making it a new member in topological materials, with promising novel applications in electronic devices.",

    "title": "Another Successful Year for <i>Advanced Theory and Simulations</i>",

    "abstract": "Advanced Theory and Simulations (ATS) was launched only two years ago and already has developed into a fully-fledged publication platform for the highest-quality research on theoretical methods, modeling, and simulation approaches in all areas of natural science and medicine. The quality of the work published in ATS is reflected by the fact that the journal was already listed in the ESCI – Emerging Sources Citation Index of the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) at the end of its first year of publication, and in Fall 2019 it also was added to Scopus (Elsevier). The evaluation process for moving Advanced Theory and Simulations from ESCI to the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) has not been completed at the time of writing, but we hope to be able to communicate more information on this soon. Highlights of 2019 include the publication of two special issues. In March, new developments in “Computational Materials Science” were presented in an issue guest-edited by Sean C. Smith (Australian National University, Canberra), and in November “Frontiers in Modeling Metal–Organic Frameworks” were presented in an issue guest-edited by Bartolomeo Civalleri (University of Turin), Guillaume Maurin (Université de Montpellier), and Veronique Van Speybroeck (Ghent University). While the special issues are focused on more specific topics, the list of most read/downloaded papers in 2018/2019 (cf. Table 1) shows the broad spectrum of topics and of authors that were of highest interest to our readers—including themes such as deep learning, Bayesian approaches, secure key generation, and the growth of 2D materials. Another topic of continuously increasing interest and importance is the field of machine learning and deep learning, which is highlighted in a virtual issue presenting articles in these research areas. More details can be found in the special features section of the journal homepage (http://www.advtheorysimul.com). Last but not least, and on behalf of the entire editorial team, I would like to thank all those who made the ongoing impressive development of Advanced Theory and Simulations possible: a dedicated and truly interdisciplinary editorial board, our authors and referees who submit their research results and help to select and publish the best content, and of course our readers for their continuous interest. We hope that you have enjoyed the first two years as much as us and we're looking forward to accompanying the journal further on its way into an exciting future! Stefan Spiegel (Editor-in-Chief)",

As a consequence, the derived entropy contributions -TΔS to the free energy ΔA for the periodic reference case were also incorrect in the published article.The corrected Figure 6c of the original manuscript is now given in Figure 3. Due to the negligible temperature dependence of ΔU, the entropy contribution is still the dominating factor that destabilizes the cp phase at higher temperature as concluded in the original manuscript.The erroneous values for ΔU cp-op , ΔU ‡ cp-op , ΔS cp-op reported in Table S1 in the supporting information have been corrected in Table 1 and volumes for the cp and op phases were added.The Column ΔS ‡ was removed due to the absence of an entropic barrier in the corrected data.The authors would like to stress that the error only concerns the results of ΔU and -TΔS for the periodic reference calculations, whereas the simulations of the non-periodic nanocrystallites are not affected at all.Furthermore, only the three Figures and the Table inthe supporting information need to be corrected, and none of the conclusions made in the written text are affected.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work provides a detailed theoretical calculations of Fe/As K ‐edge X‐ray absorption spectra of six different iron based superconducting compounds FeSe, LiFeAs, NaFeAs, , , and , by using three distinct levels of calculations to evaluate the electron–hole interaction properly. First, density functional theory (DFT) in absence of core–hole effect which completely neglects the electron–hole interaction; second, supercell based core–hole calculations where the static electron–hole Coulomb interaction is taken into account; and finally, by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) which takes care of the dynamical screening of photo‐electron and core–hole. The characteristic peaked features and spectral weight distribution in Fe K ‐edge absorption spectrum matches well in both the theoretical methods, especially when “core–hole” effect are explicitly considered for iron chalcogenides. Hence, the electron–hole screening effect is almost equivalent in both the methods for these compounds. Occurrence of an additional higher energy peak and bifurcation of some peaks in the BSE spectrum may be attributed to excitonic effects. BSE based As K ‐edge absorption spectrum differs significantly with the DFT ones in some of the studied compounds, indicating more paramount excitonic effects for As edges. Nonresonant inelastic X‐ray scattering is also investigated at various momentum transfers and converges to corresponding X‐ray absorption spectrum at low momentum transfers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides like tantalum diselenide (TaSe 2 ) exhibit exciting behaviors at low temperatures, including the emergence of charge density wave (CDW) states. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is used to catalog influences of van der Waals interactions and reduced dimensionality on the CDW atomic structures as a function of thickness, with the former effect being most strongly present between the layers of bulk TaSe 2 , slightly reduced in few‐layer TaSe 2 , and effectively absent in monolayer (1L) TaSe 2 . To support the validity of the DFT models, experimental Raman data are provided for monolayer, bilayer, and bulk TaSe 2 in the spectral range 165–215 cm −1 . The phonons seen in the experimental Raman spectra are compared with the results calculated from the DFT models as a function of temperature and layer number. The matching of data and calculations substantiates the model's description of the CDW structural formation as a function of thickness, which is shown in depth for 1L through 6L systems. These results highlight the importance of understanding interlayer interactions, which are pervasive in many quantum phenomena involving 2D confinement.",

One of the challenges related to the use of hydrogen as a clean energy source is safety. In this study, a microwave hydrogen sensor has been presented for detection of hydrogen leakage. An analytical model is developed and the performance of the sensor is investigated using numerical analysis tools. It has been shown that with optimal geometrical parameters of the sensor structure, a wide range of sensitivity levels depending on a wide range of Q‐factor can be achieved. Utilizing a palladium disk with a radius of 750 μm can detect hydrogen with a sensitivity as high as 30 MHz per % hydrogen when μm. Average error between analytical model and numerical results is 0.23%. With reference to this work, it is believed that more compact and sensitive microwave hydrogen sensors will be produced for future uses.",

Ionic polymer metal composites are a promising class of active materials, realized through electroless plating of ion‐exchange membranes. The plating and electrode‐membrane interface play a key role on their performance, but computational tools to inform the selection of the plating material and optimize the plating process are currently lacking. Here, this gap is filled through the study of the electrode‐membrane interface in different types of ion‐exchange membranes via molecular dynamics simulations. Both commercially available cation‐ and research‐grade anion‐exchange membranes are studied here. For platinum coating, it is predicted that cation‐exchange membranes will have a superior interface than anion‐exchange membranes, in terms of metal penetration into the membrane, reliability of actuation performance, and interface stability. The results are in line with previous endeavors documenting the higher stability of the interface for cation‐ than for anion‐exchange membranes, easier plating processes, and better electrochemical performance when working with cation‐exchange membranes. The proposed computational framework offers a versatile environment for testing different types of coatings for specific membranes, toward optimizing the performance of electrochemical devices with plated flexible electrodes.",

Through this method, the vertical force of the wheel‐rail and the resonance response of the axle box vibration under different rigid–flexible combinations of wheelset axle box are obtained. The resonance response characteristics of the axle box of the wheelset and the main factors affecting the resonance characteristics are analyzed. Results show that the bending mode of the wheelset considerably affects the vibration characteristics of the axle box. The mass, the moment of inertia around the x ‐axis, and the position of the center of gravity of the axle box also greatly affect the resonance characteristics of the wheel‐to‐axle box.",

In this context we were especially happy that ATS was accepted into the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) Science Citation Index Expanded and received its first Impact Factor in summer 2020, with a strong value of 2.951. These developments, accompanied by increasing submission numbers, confirm the high quality of work published in the journal and the scientific community's recognition of ATS as an excellent channel for publishing and disseminating their newest research results—as well as Review articles—in a broad range of scientific fields but always with a strong emphasis on theory, modeling, simulation, computational, or mathematical aspects. The broad spectrum of topics and of authors that were of highest interest to our readers in 2019/2020 is documented in the list of most read papers shown in Table 1, including themes such as nanoporous materials, chaotic dynamical systems, photovoltaics, and detection of the COVID-19 virus. We also were impressed by the artistry and creativity of our authors when displaying scientific topics in an eye-catching way on the covers of ATS. The full cover galleries can be found on the journal homepage, but we would like to present a few select examples from 2020 here (Figure 1). Last but not least, and on behalf of the entire editorial team, I would like to thank all those who make the ongoing impressive development of Advanced Theory and Simulations possible: a dedicated and truly interdisciplinary editorial board, the authors and referees who submit their research results and help to select and publish the best content, and of course our readers for their continued interest.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in optical quantum computation set up a broad discussion on quantum supremacy and its practicability. Lack of programmability and extreme working conditions remain the challenges, calling for a programmable computation scheme. The quasi‐2D layered materials introduce new architectures for the optical neural networks (ONNs), which support various programmable computations following the on‐demand layer design. Compared with the traditional ONNs, Moiré ONNs architectures are more flexible to manufacture via layer number or twist angle control. A general Penn's model to demonstrate the mechanism inside is developed: the dielectric constant control through the layer and twisted bilayer angle dependence, respectively. Theoretically, this device can conduct demo computations ranging from boson sampling to image classification, where quantum computing shows its significant advantages. Instead of redundant 3D‐printing and lithography in traditional ONNs, the Moiré computation framework can train different tasks through programmable twists on single layers without replacing materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study investigates rheological properties of microphase‐separated lamellar structures formed by unentangled and weakly entangled diblock copolymer melts under a finite amplitude oscillatory shear flow and a steady shear flow. To simulate such a system, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to reproduce the lamellar structures, where a multi‐chain slip‐spring model is combined with DPD simulation to mimic entanglement effects. By imposing an oscillatory shear flow, this model enables us to measure storage and loss moduli for three different (parallel, perpendicular, and transverse) lamellar orientations with respect to the flow direction. These orientations display distinctive rheological behaviors, and especially the transverse orientation exhibits a peculiar behavior owing to a finite expansion of the lamellar interfaces, which differs from a previous study. In a steady shear flow, steady shear viscosities of parallel and perpendicular orientations are evaluated. In this case, the orientations of lamellar domains and the local orientation and stretching of bonds near the lamellar interfaces affect the steady shear viscosities. A spatial distribution of entanglements also affects the steady shear viscosities differently from another previous study.",

The random packet losses are assumed to occur in both channels from sensor to controller and from controller to actuator. Different from most of the existing studies, the information entropy is utilized to characterize the uncertainties of the random packet dropouts. A hybrid cognitive control model is designed for NCSs subject to random packet losses. More specifically, the proposed hybrid cognitive control algorithm is constructed by using the Q‐learning and backstepping control simultaneously. That is, the Q‐learning is employed for the cognitive controller to regulate the backstepping controller and meantime act on the control object. In addition, the information gap is defined based on the information entropy, and used for depicting the uncertainties of the random packet dropouts. Simulation results are performed to validate the designed hybrid cognitive control method, demonstrating that it can eliminate the effects of packet losses and thus performs better than the traditional backstepping or proportional‐integral‐derivative (PID) controllers.",

Numerical results are demonstrated for a periodic nano‐scale Poiseuille flow problem with SPC/E water. The computed time‐averaged velocity profiles are compared with the analytical solution, and the thermal velocity fluctuations are well reproduced in comparison with the equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. Several options to account for the long‐range electrostatics interactions available in GROMACS are incorporated in the model and compared. It is demonstrated that the suggested non‐equilibrium multiscale model is a factor of 4 to 18 faster in comparison with the standard all‐atom equilibrium molecular dynamics model for the same computational domain size.",

Pure adsorption and binary adsorption are performed in all silica faujasite (FAU) and Na‐FAU zeolite combined with density distributions and radial distribution functions (RDF). A new method to describe the adsorption mechanism in FAU has been proposed. One adsorbate is fixed in the center of 12 ring (12C) or the center of supercage (CSC) as the reference point. Then, RDFs represent the probability to find other adsorbates in a shell at the distance r of the reference point. Thus, the adsorption sites appeared are obtained as several ring shape areas. The intersection points, especially with high occurrence possibilities, is regarded as the main adsorption sites, showing good agreement with density distribution. Comparing RDFs of sorbate‐12C and the location of Na ions, the curve of thiophene‐12C and the curve of Na‐12C overlap can be found, which means thiophene prefers to adsorb around Na ions. On this point, the reason why the separation property of Na‐FAU zeolites is better than that of all silica FAU zeolites can be clearly explained.",

This can only be achieved through the separation of the linear alkanes from the branched alkanes or through conversion of linear to branched isomer. A separation method based on levitation and blow torch effects has been recently shown to separate neopentane from n ‐pentane. The same method has been employed here to separate n ‐hexane from 2,2‐dimethyl butane. This method provides a single step process in which the n ‐hexane can be removed completely. The method yields very high purity with minimum expenditure of energy. Several properties have been computed to quantify the separation and indicate the degree of separation. The method if implemented experimentally, will provide a generic method for the separation of molecular mixtures. The steps necessary to realize the method experimentally are discussed. The setup for scaling up of the separation using the levi–blow method for industries is also presented.",

The cover shows an ultra-wide band gap PhC device.",

    "abstract": "The picture shows a transmembrane receptor located at the surface of a cell. It is the µ-opioid receptor, which is responsible for suppressing pain sensations. It is important to know how probable it is that a pain relieve drug (pink, fentanyl) will bind to and activate the receptor. The augmented jump chain described in article 2000274 by Alexander Sikorski, Marcus Weber, and Christof Schütte offers a possible mathematical framework for answering this question.",
