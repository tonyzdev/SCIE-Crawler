    "abstract": "Genotype by environment interaction for production and fertility was studied by use of a reaction norm model. Milk recording data, comprising 927 929 records, were analysed to predict reaction norms for young bulls of the Nordic Red dairy breeds. Random regressions were estimated for each bull, regressing phenotypic values of daughters on herd environment. The phenotypic measures were 305 days kg protein production and days open in first lactation. The herd environment was defined as the herd-year average of protein production and days open, respectively. Heritability of protein production and days open and genetic correlation between the two traits were estimated as functions of the herd environment. The results showed that the genetic parameters change over environments, which are measured on a continuous scale across countries. Grouping of observations is avoided and thereby the problem of genetic connectedness between groups or countries may be avoided. Although significant genetic variation for the slope of the reaction norm was found, there was little reranking of sires, except between extreme environments. More appropriate models and methods need to be developed for further studies of genetic variation in reaction norms. Keywords: Days OpenProtein YieldRandom Regression Model",

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect on health and performance of feeding different levels of zinc (as zinc oxide) for one, two or three weeks after weaning to piglets weaned at 28 days of age. A supplement of 2500 ppm zinc for two weeks after weaning reduced the incidence and severity of non-specific post-weaning diarrhoea by up to 50%. The daily gain, but not feed intake and feed efficiency, was significantly influenced by the dietary zinc level. Piglets fed 2500 ppm zinc showed the best performance. The beneficial effect of a temporary supply of 2500 and 4000 ppm zinc on post-weaning diarrhoea was found to be coincident with an increased alkaline phosphatase activity and zinc concentration in serum. The frequency of post-weaning diarrhoea was shown to be affected by the dietary content of calcium and copper.",

Here, we briefly describe some major achievements of Welfare Quality® and identify future research priorities, potential strategies and organisational structures to build on the outcomes. Achievements include: definition of principles and criteria of good welfare; development of standardised, primarily animal-based measures for each welfare criterion and their integration in an overall assessment model. Since Welfare Quality® could not answer all the questions we recommend: Continued development and refinement of the assessment systems and extension to new species. The development of automatic measures of welfare to reduce the duration of the assessment while still retaining its holistic nature. Exploration of potential implementation strategies across food chain actors. Establishment of an independent body to manage and update the assessment and information systems, support their implementation and inform and engage stakeholders.

    "abstract": "In 16 dairy herds, a lameness scoring system which was reasonably quick and easy to use was evaluated with regard to reliability and repeatability. The ultimate aim was to include it into an on-farm welfare assessment protocol. Locomotion scores in individual cows (n = 206) were significantly correlated with the heel and sole disorder indices obtained at routine claw trimmings (e.g. index for hind limb lesions: r s = 0.40, p = 0.0001; Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients). The inclusion of lesions caused by digital dermatitis increased correlation coefficients when hind limbs and all four feet were considered (r s = 0.47/0.50). The inter-observer repeatability of locomotion scores in individual cows was high, and the variation between observers was low when calculated as a percentage of animals within each scoring class. Thus the locomotion scoring system proved to be a useful tool for assessing lameness, and as such a valuable part of on-farm welfare assessment in dairy cattle. It is recommended that scoring be performed at least twice during the housing period. Keywords: Claw LesionsLamenessOn-FARM ResearchWelfare Assessment",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to estimate genetic correlations between fertility and production traits in first, second and third lactations as well as between fertility traits measured in the same way at different ages. The fertility traits studied were: number of inseminations per service period, number of treatments for reproductive disturbances, interval between first and last inseminations, interval between calving and first insemination, and interval between calving and last insemination. Early milk production was measured as the average of the energy-corrected milk yield at the second and third monthly testdays in a lactation. The number of records was approximately 450 000, 350 000, 180 000 and 75 000 in the heifer period, first, second, and third lactations, respectively. A linear, trivariate model that included the effects of herd-year, year, month, age and sire of the cow was applied. To reduce the effect of ongoing selection, 305-days kg protein production in first lactation was included as a variate in all of the analyses. Correlations between the herd-year effects indicated that factors of herd-year level conducive to increased production had a tendency to increase the number of inseminations as well as the number of reproductive treatments, although there was an earlier start and termination of the insemination period. Genetic correlations between fertility traits and production were in the range of 0.2-0.4, all of them unfavourable and higher at later parities. The genetic correlations between fertility traits in the heifer period and the same traits in first lactation were 0.7. Genetic correlations between the first and second lactation varied between 0.7 and 0.9, and between the second and third lactation they were all 0.9 or higher. In conclusion, fertility and production traits need to be selected for simultaneously if fertility is going to be maintained along further genetic improvement on production, and such selection should include fertility results from lactating cows.",

Intestinal digestibility was obtained using the mobile bag technique on intact protein and on the samples of undegraded dietary protein from each feed. The results showed that increased degradability of the protein in the rumen decreased the intestinal digestibility, which shows that feedstuffs contain a protein fraction which is both undegradable in the rumen and indigestible in the intestine. The results thus indicate that it is possible to calculate the intestinal digestibility from information on the intestinal digestibility of the protein in the intact feed at any degradability estimated. The results clearly show that intestinal digestibility of undegraded dietary protein cannot be considered as a constant value as used in most protein evaluation systems introduced in recent years.",

Agricultural practices were evaluated within the framework set by global food demand and limited area available for agricultural production. Among options for higher C sequestration, we found minimizing the time with bare soil, improving recycling of organic materials and increasing yields through N fertilization to be efficient. Indeed, our results suggest that C stocks can increase with 1–2 kg C for each kg of mineral N fertilizer applied. Possibilities to decrease C emissions by reduced tillage were found to be limited under Nordic conditions. Options for reducing C emissions from drained cultivated organic soils are limited when used as cropland. Extensive production leads to lower soil C stocks and requires more land. Increasing photosynthesis at the global scale by intensification of crop production was found to be the most effective mitigation option and is a prerequisite for preventing further areal expansion of agriculture.",

The discussed methods are: optimum contribution selection; maximum avoidance of inbreeding and factorial matings, making use of the genetics of other, related breeds, integrating life and cryoconservation schemes; rotational breeding scheme; and the introduction of novel traits from conserved populations into commercial breeding populations. The use of dense marker genotyping reduces the necessity of pedigree recording, which is problematic in many conservation schemes. For the choice of breeds in across breed conservation schemes, the following selection criteria were considered: (i) Weitzman's diversity; (ii) gene diversity/expected heterozygosity; (iii) maximum total genetic variance; and (iv) a criterion that puts five times as much weight on between breed compared to within breed diversity. For several reasons, criterion (iii) was considered the criterion of choice.",

Three hybrids were used: Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) were kept in all three systems, Dekalb XL (DK) were kept in both aviaries and Lohmann Brown (LB) in M only. Production and feed conversion in M were inferior but not significantly different from C but significantly better than in L. Proportions of dirty eggs were significantly higher in the avaries. No significant differences were found in interior egg quality traits between keeping systems. LSL showed higher production and better feed conversion than the other hybrids and a tendency for a lower proportion of mislaid eggs. Mortality varied considerably between the aviary pens, reaching 35% in LB mainly owing to cannibalism and salpingitis. Keel bone lesions and bumble foot appeared in the aviaries, while toe pad hyperkeratosis was observed in C. Hens in aviaries had significantly stronger bones (tibia and humerus) and showed more wounds from pecks, inferior plumage condition and dirtier feet than in C. LSL had more bumble foot injuries than LB but better plumage condition than DK.

Records were available from 11 016 Yorkshire piglets from 1046 first parity litters in a Swedish experimental herd. Each mortality trait was analysed jointly with birth weight, using bivariate models. Both mixed linear models and threshold models were used. The threshold models took environmental and maternal genetic effects into account, whereas the linear models also included a direct genetic effect of the piglet on its birth weight. The estimated heritabilities were low for all mortality traits (0.01-0.15), with the lowest estimate for crushing and the highest for stillbirth. The estimated environmental correlations between the different mortality traits and birth weight were negative. The estimated genetic correlations between crushing and birth weight (both direct and maternal effect) were also negative in both models, indicating that sows with low-weight piglets are more likely to crush piglets. However, the genetic correlations between stillbirth and birth weight (both direct and maternal effect) were positive. These results suggest that stillbirth and crushing are traits with different genetic backgrounds, and that genetically increasing the birth weight of the piglets may result in more stillborn piglets.

In the experiments a variety of feeds have been used, supplying varying amounts of fat differing greatly in fatty acid composition. Generally, when de novo fatty acid synthesis, resulting in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, is predominant, the back fat will be very firm, while the deposition of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids will produce soft backfat. The relationship between the amount and composition of dietary fat and the content and profile of intramuscular fat seems complicated. Oats, rapeseed, sunflower seed, animal fat and vegetable oil should only be included in limited amounts in the diet to avoid high occurrence of unacceptable soft backfat and rancidity of the carcass. The iodine value (IV) of backfat is shown to be related to the iodine value product (IVP) of the dietary fat through the following equation: IV=47.1+0.14 × IVP/day (R 2=0.86).",

The prevalence of fresh versus severe tail biting was 11.7% and 1.3%, respectively. All forms of tail damage caused an increased risk of carcass condemnation, especially due to abscesses (RR: 4.9 for all tail damage). Severe tail biting caused a highly increased risk for condemnation (RR: 5.2 for condemnations in general, RR: 17.6 for condemnations due to abscesses). Of carcasses with severely bitten tails, 26.8% were partly or fully condemned. Between-farm variation in prevalence of tail damage was large, stressing the importance of on-farm factors. Tail biting appears to be a common problem in Finland and measures should be taken to improve the situation. Tail damage, in all its forms, needs to be taken seriously, as it has, in addition to causing lowered welfare to the animals, large economic implications for production.",

The aim of this review is to present recent knowledge of dietary fibre, particularly its effect on digestibility of protein and fat and its consequences for diet formulation for growing and fattening pigs. The authors reviewed the relevant literature from the last 15 years and concluded that each 1 g NDF/kg diet increment results in a mean reduction of between 0.03 and 0.08% of ileal apparent protein digestibility and 1 g NDF/kg dry matter reduces the digestibility coefficient of energy by approximately 0.1%. The effect of different types of fibre on nutrient digestibility has not been quantified; however, soluble fibre reduces the apparent and true ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids as well as the fat and the energy more than insoluble fibre. Therefore, it is necessary to develop regression equations that compute the reduction in ileal digestibility of nutrients as a function of different types of fibre.",

Neutral detergent fibre intake was higher for animals fed hempseed cake than for those fed soybean meal (P<0.05). In addition, the number of long particles in faeces was lower (P<0.05) and faecal dry matter content and consistency were higher from animals which were fed hempseed cake (P<0.05; steers only). Higher feed intakes in calves fed hempseed cake (P<0.05) combined with similar LWG resulted in lower feed efficiency in hemp-fed calves (P<0.05). In conclusion, hempseed cake compared to soybean meal as a protein feed for intensively fed growing cattle results in similar production and improved rumen function.",

The data consist of the results from routine milk samples collected from clinical and subclinical mastitis and submitted to laboratories all over the country. In the database, bacteriological information has been recorded on an individual cow basis. A total of 77,051 pathogen records submitted to the database from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2006 were retrieved for this preliminary report of pathogen distribution. Staphylococcus aureus (18.26% and 17.73%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (17.57% and 23.51%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens from the milk samples. Seasonal and regional differences in pathogen distribution were also found. The pathogen information is primarily used for targeting the antimicrobial treatment of the cow, but also for designing specific mastitis control strategies for the herds. Pathogen data can also be useful for national mastitis control programmes and breeding programmes of dairy cattle for the selection of more resistant animals.",

    "abstract": "A data-set with 47 treatment means (N = 211) was compiled from research institutions in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in order to develop a prediction equation for enteric methane (CH4) emissions from dairy cows. The aim was to implement the equation in the Nordic feed evaluation system NorFor. The equation should therefore be based on input variables available in NorFor. The best equation to predict CH4 (MJ/d) was based on dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d), and content of (g/kg DM) fatty acids (FA), crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The equation was CH4 = 1.36 (±0.10) × DMI – 0.125 (±0.039) × FA – 0.02 (±0.012) × CP + 0.017 (±0.005) × NDF (RMSE = 3.00 MJ CH4/d; CV = 13.8%; R2 = 0.77), where RMSE is the root mean square error and CV is the coefficient of variation. However, CP was on the borderline of being significant and did not quantitatively explain much variation in CH4 emission. Based on the present research, we concluded, therefore, that the equation CH4 = 1.23 (±0.08) × DMI – 0.145 (±0.039) × FA + 0.012 (±0.005) × NDF (RMSE = 3.10 MJ CH4/d; CV = 14.3%; R2 = 0.75) is most suited for being implemented in NorFor. However, the ability of the proposed equation to predict enteric methane emissions is uncertain until evaluated on an independent data-set.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present paper is to describe the framework of a new method for assessing dairy cows' welfare at farm level. In contrast with TGIs, the method is based on observations of animals and leads to several scores according to the needs of the animals. We started with five general needs. These were the five freedoms: freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease; freedom to express normal behaviour; and freedom from fear and distress. These were further subdivided into 16 basic needs. A list of the 49 indices, or welfare-indicators, most commonly measured in animals (behaviours, injuries etc.) was produced and the patterns each index can have were described. Each pattern was rated on a value-scale with regard to any need. On this basis frequencies within a herd reflecting a very low, low, high or very high level of welfare were determined, allowing us to attribute a score to a given herd for any pattern. We then proposed to pool the scores obtained by a herd for all patterns of a given index into a single score for that index. To this end, we defined logical rules that limited compensation between scores. Step by step, the information can be pooled to obtain a single score for indices that are closely related, for basic needs, and finally for each of the five freedoms. Ways to validate such a method are discussed. The method can be used in a survey to detect relations between environmental conditions and animal welfare. It can also be used in connection with dairy farm labelling. Keywords: Animal WelfareCattleOn-FARM AssessmentHerd",

    "abstract": "Abstract The basis for using determined values of endogenous ileal protein and amino acid losses in the protein evaluation of pig feeds is reviewed. The amounts of endogenous protein and amino acids in ileal digesta may be determined by numerous methods. These include N-free diets, regression analysis, enzyme hydrolysed casein (EHC) coupled with ultra-filtration, modifying lysine to homoarginine, isotope dilution techniques and calculations based on the difference between the in vitro and in vivo digestibility of protein and amino acids. Endogenous ileal protein loss seems to be influenced primarily by dietary dry matter intake and secondarily by the composition of the diet and can be divided into a basal and an extra loss. The basal loss after ingestion of experimental N-free diets is 10-15 kg−1 DM intake, but, under more physiologically normal conditions when protein-containing diets are ingested, the basal loss seems to be about 20 g kg−1 DM intake. When vegetable feedstuffs are ingested there is often an extra loss specifically induced by the presence of dietary fibre and/or antinutritional factors (ANFs), resulting in total losses that are typically in the range of 20 to 40 g kg−1 DM intake. The amino acid composition of endogenous protein is relatively constant for different diets and methods of determination and seems not to be influenced significantly by the amount of loss and liveweight of pig. For practical purposes, and lacking evidence to the contrary, the composition can be considered to be constant and the following general composition (g per 160 g N) of essential amino acids is pro posed: lysine 30, methionine 10, cystine 16, threonine 45, tryptophan 12, isoleucine 25, leucine 40, histidine 15, phenylalanine 30, tyrosine 20, valine 35. The composition is, compared with ideal protein and most feedstuffs, characterized by a relatively low contribution of all essential amino acids, except threonine, cystine and tryptophan.",

Diurnal variation in urinary concentration of urea, allantoin and creatinine was also studied. A total of 24 multiparous lactating dairy cows were selected from a production experiment and divided into two 12-cow groups according to their lactation stage (LG1, 14th-16th week of lactation; and LG2, 26th-30th week of lactation). Within groups, cows were fed four different rations (three cows per treatment). Four concentrate mixtures with two levels of protein [19 and 14% of crude protein on dry matter (DM) basis] and two different rumen degradabilities (72 and 52%) of the dominating protein feed rapeseed meal, were fed to the cows together with pasture silage and hay. In both groups of cows the urea concentration in plasma, urine and milk increased (p<0.05) with increasing protein intake. Based on the pooled data from both lactation groups, significant (p<0.001) correlations were found between the intake of PBV (protein balance value in the rumen) and urea concentrations in plasma (R 2=0.73), urine (R 2=0.53) and milk (R 2=0.63). Also significant (p<0.001) relationships were observed between plasma urea and urea in urine (R 2=0.78) and milk (R 2=0.73), and between milk urea and urinary nitrogen losses (R 2=0.64). In LG2 there was an increase in urinary allantoin excretion associated with an increase in DM intake. A clear diurnal pattern of concentrations in urine of urea, allantoin and creatinine was observed in LG1 and LG2. The use of allantoin to creatinine ratio in spot samples of urine appeared to be an useful index of the urinary allantoin excretion in intact animals.",

In the post-treatment period from day five until the end of their 24th week of lactation, all three groups received the same treatment (tie stalls in winter and pasture in summer). The results from the treatment period showed that calves, which were together with their dams (groups C0 and C4), grew about 100% more per day than calves in group S0. The calves in group S0 were licked less and had the highest duration of non-nutritive sucking on equipment.

A social behaviour test in weeks 3 and 11 showed that calves from group C4 preferred to spend more time near an unfamiliar heifer than calves from group S0. The results of a forced human approach test on pasture when the heifers were 15-18 months-old showed that heifers from group C4 were more difficult to approach than those from groups S0 and C0.

Hens in the furnished cage had better plumage condition, less toe pad hyperkeratosis, shorter claws, less rear body wounds and stronger humerus, but dirtier feet than hens in the conventional cage. Hens in the larger group sizes had the dirtiest feet. In the furnished cage, on average, 86% of all eggs were laid in the nests and 0.6% in the sandbaths. The rolling out efficiency from nests was best in the larger group sizes. During night less than 0.5% of the hens stayed in the sandbath and less than 2% stayed in the nest. Average use of perches was 28% during the day and 91% at night. Hens in the small group sizes used the sandbath most. Dust‐bathing behaviour also occurred on the wire floor.

The experiment was undertaken with a control feed, activated carbon, or one of three biochars: gasified, wood-based, and straw-based. The additives were dosed at 9% of the feed dry matter (DM). Half (0.5) gram feed samples, sealed in filter bags, were incubated in buffered rumen fluid for 48 hours at 39°C. Additives were put into bottles, outside the filter bags. Addition of biochar products numerically, but not significantly, reduced CH4 production between 11% and 17% compared to a control. The experiment showed that adding biochar to feed did not significantly affect the degradable DM and that biochar, used as a feed additive, might reduce in vitro rumen methane production.",

The development in tools for deriving economic values has been from simple profit equations to detailed bio-economic models simulating the whole production system or industry. The importance of including the perspective of the stakeholders is also stressed. Stakeholder perspectives can be considered by using stated preference methods such as choice experiments. Also desired gain index or selection indices can be used in combination with profit equations or bio-economic models to adjust for undesirable genetic changes in breeding objective traits.

Thermal images of the rear feet of 139 lactating dairy cows were taken with a thermal camera and evaluated using imaging software. Foot lesions identified in the study included white line disease (WLD), sole ulcer (SU) and digital dermatitis (DD). Temperatures at the coronary band (CBT) and the skin (ST) were recorded. Cows were scored for locomotion on a scale of 1–5 (1 = normal and 5 = severely lame). CBT was higher for all types of foot lesion (34.1 ± 2.3, 33.8 ± 1.6 and 33.1 ± 1.6°C for WLD, SU and DD, respectively) than for healthy (32.6 ± 1.9°C) feet. ST was higher only for WLD (33.2 ± 2.0°C) compared to healthy feet (31.5 ± 1.7°C). ΔT (temperature difference between CBT and ST) was higher for SU (2.1 ± 0.8°C) than healthy feet (1.1 ± 0.9°C). Locomotion scores (LSs) were similar between healthy cows (2.2 ± 0.7) and DD (2.4 ± 0.7) but greater for SU and WLD cows (3.0 ± 0.9, 3.0 ± 0.8) than healthy cows. The threshold values established for CBT and ST were 33.5°C (sensitivity = 77.8%, specificity = 65.2%) and 33.7°C (sensitivity = 44.4%, specificity = 92.9%) for SU, and 34.4oC (sensitivity = 28.1%, specificity = 88.6%) and 31.8°C (sensitivity = 60.7%, specificity = 55.4%) for overall lesion, respectively. These results indicate that IRT can be a useful tool for detection of SU, but not WLD and DD. In addition, CBT and ΔT were the best indicators for the detection of foot lesions.",

(2) Diets containing high Vitamin A (9000–15 000 IU/kg diet), E (150–500 mg/kg diet), C (150–500 mg/kg diet) and Zn (30/60 mg/kg diet) and Se (0.1–1 mg/kg diet) can decrease the amounts of free radicals, support enzyme activity and prevent lipid peroxidation in poultry. (3) Application of antioxidant vitamins and micro minerals in poultry nutrition is more effective in combination than separately.",

The status of these management tools is reported and their applicability under Scandinavian conditions evaluated. Aversive conditioning usually involves treating baits with an emetic compound (usually lithium chloride), and has shown inconsistent and inconclusive results. Repellents and deterrents include physical, chemical and acoustic stimuli or devices that cause predators to stop an unwanted behaviour or to retreat from an area. Chemical repellents are not particularly effective against coyotes but have been effective for wolverines and bears under some conditions (e.g. with the availability of untreated, alternative prey). Projectile repellents give an immediate, positive result with bears, but their use is limited. Visual and acoustic devices work well, but only for a limited time, as predators quickly habituate to these devices. To summarize, these methods generally show little promise in reducing livestock depredation on a large-scale or long-term basis, especially under the conditions prevailing in Scandinavia.",

The experimental design was a 3 x 3 Latin square with three rumen‐ and duodenal‐fistulated dairy cows, given a basal diet with addition of zero (0), 0.6 kg sucrose (S) or 0.6 kg lactose (L). The concentration of individual soluble sugars and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the rumen of cows was measured after introduction of a single dose of the sucrose, lactose or glucose through the rumen cannula. The rate of hydrolysis of sucrose varied from 1200 to 1404% h−1 and was not affected by addition of sugars to the basal diet. The rate of hydrolysis of lactose was 248 and 204% h−1 for treatment 0 and S, but was considerable higher (540% h−1) when lactose was added to the basal diet. The rate of glucose fermentation after glucose dosing varied from 422 to 738% h−1, and increased with both sucrose and lactose addition to the diet. The rate of fermentation of monosaccharides originating from disaccharide hydrolysis was very high, from approximately 300 to 700% h−1. Key words: cowsdigestionsaccharidessugars",

The purpose of an ethical account is to report on the consequences of individual events and routine methods on the farm for all affected parties, and to ensure that the farmer is conscious of his ethical priorities. A procedure for an annual account is presented and the concepts involved in it are explained. Welfare assessment involves information from four sources: the system, the system's application, animal behaviour and animal health. Welfare assessment is an aid for operational management as well as for strategic planning. This ethical account was developed in collaboration with twenty livestock farms over a period of three years. In the course of its evaluation farmers were interviewed by a social scientist who was not directly involved in the project. It was concluded from these interviews that the implementation of welfare assessment, in this way, in the ethical account was a success.

    "abstract": "The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the causes of variation in the reproductive performance of purebred Swedish Landrace (L) and Swedish Yorkshire (Y) sows. Data analysed comprised farrowings from 1994 through 1997 from 19 Swedish nucleus herds and included 20 275 litters from 6989 purebred sows (3598 L and 3491 Y). The main traits analysed were litter size, weaning-to-first-service interval (WSI), farrowing rate, remating rate and age at first farrowing. Analysis of variance was used for the statistical analysis of quantitative data. Logistic regression analysis was applied for binary data using the GLIMMIX macro in the SAS program. Factors included in the analyses were breed of sow, breed of boar, parity number, herd-year combination within breed, mating type (natural mating or artificial insemination), lactation length and month of the year. L sows, compared with Y sows, produced larger litters [11.61 vs 11.54 total born/litter (ns) and 10.94 vs 10.58 born alive/litter (P<0.001)] and had a longer WSI (5.5 vs 5.4 days, P<0.001), a higher farrowing rate (82.8 vs 80.9% units, P<0.05) and a lower remating rate (6.2 vs 8.8% units, P<0.001). On average, L sows were younger at first farrowing than Y sows (355.6 vs 368.6 days, P<0.001). The seasonal influence on WSI was greater for primiparous sows than for multiparous sows. Primiparous sows weaned from June to October had a longer WSI than those weaned from January to May or in November (P<0.05). Mating in August resulted in the lowest farrowing rate and the highest remating rate. The seasonal influence on farrowing rate and WSI was more pronounced in Y sows than in L sows. However, season had no significant influence on litter size in either L or Y sows.",

Each sheep received six treatments: 0, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 mmol h−1 SCFA infused for 8 h in a semi-fasted state. The infused SCFA had a molar proportion of 65:20:15 (acetate:propionate:butyrate). [1 - 13C]Na-acetate was infused intravenously during the experiment for measurement of portal drained viscera (PDV) metabolism and irreversible loss rate (ILR) of acetate. Portal blood flow was measured by ultrasonic flowprobes. Portal blood, arterial blood and rumen liquid were sampled during the last 4 h of the experiments. A model of individual metabolite fluxes in the portal drained viscera is presented. The absorption rate of acetate, measured as portal net appearance plus PDV metabolism, and irreversible loss rate of acetate showed a linear response to infusion rate and accounted for 54 ± 8% and 73 ± 9% of infused acetate, respectively. The B-L flux of arterial acetate, i.e. the flux from the blood to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, was estimated to be 5 ± 1% of infused acetate, whereas the metabolism of arterial acetate in the PDV tissues increased with increasing infusion rate only at the lower infusion rates. Portal net appearance of propionate and D-3-hydroxybutyrate showed a linear response to infusion rate and accounted for 62 ± 7% and 21 ± 3% of infused propionate and butyrate, respectively. The portal net appearance of butyrate showed a quadratic response to infusion rate of butyrate. The average recovery of butyrate reached 25 ± 2% at the highest infusion level. The implications of the results in relation to feed evaluation are discussed.",

Costs and benefits were analysed in terms of reduced livestock losses. The most common guardian animals are dogs, which have been shown to reduce predation (documented mostly for coyote) by 11?100%. Livestock guardian dogs have also been used effectively against bear, wolf and cheetah. Donkeys are also used as guardian animals, and their effectiveness lies in their natural herding behaviour and aggression, especially against canids. The effectiveness of donkeys varies considerably dependent upon the predator species and the temperament of the individual donkey. Llamas are also used as a guardian animal, with approximately the same characteristics as the donkeys, and will defend themselves against most predators. The use of guardian animals appears to be an effective tool for reducing livestock depredation and should be evaluated in areas with high predation losses against the cost of changing production systems.",

Both in ileal digesta and faecal material low concentrations of fatty acids were found in the extracted fat. The digestibility of fat as well as fatty acids increased when adding fat to the diets, indicating a strong influence of endogenous lipids. The amount of endogenous fat determined at ileum level or in faeces was calculated to be 4.7 and 4.4 g, respectively, per kg dietary DM intake. Although the values were low compared with other published data they correspond to about 10% of the fat intake from a standard Danish grower diet. The amount of endogenous saturated fatty acids in faeces was higher than that of unsaturated but lower than at the terminal ileum level, suggesting microbial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids in the hindgut. The dominating fatty acids at terminal ileum contributed about 2% of dietary fatty acids when pigs were fed a standard Danish diet.",

The experiment was a factorial design with two levels of protein (normal and high), two levels of dietary fat (3 and 15% of DM) and three levels of minerals (50, 100 and 150% of Danish Standard). Four litters, each of six female pigs, were used in the experiment. Increasing the dietary protein content resulted in a moderate but significant increase in the ileal digestibility of fatty acids. The increase was most pronounced for the saturated fatty acids. Addition of animal fat to the basal diet caused a substantial increase in ileal digestibility of all fatty acids except stearic acid (18:0). A variation in the dietary mineral content of ±50% of the Danish Standard had no significant influence on ileal digestibility of crude fat and fatty acids. Apparently, microbial hydrogenation occurred in the hind-gut, but the increase in stearic acid (18:0) excretion could not be explained solely by biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. The interactions between dietary protein and fat on the increase of faecal 18:0 showed that the dietary composition had a very complex effect on the microbial activity in the hind-gut. Consequently, determination of fatty acid digestibility should be performed at the terminal ileum, whereas crude fat (Stoldt) digestibility can be carried out on faecal material.",

The milk intake was estimated from the water turnover in the piglets corrected for the production of metabolic water. The water turnover was estimated from the water dilution space and the fractional turnover of body water, determined by the rate of D 2 O dilution. To determine the magnitude of isotopic recycling, a randomly selected piglet in each litter was not enriched with D 2 O. Milk production of the four lactating sows was also measured by the weigh-suckle-weigh (WSW) method on days 4, 11 and 18 of lactation. The average daily milk production determined by the D 2 O dilution technique (9.91 - 0.69 kg) was higher ( P <0.05) than that determined by the uncorrected WSW method (8.65 - 0.81 kg). Different procedures for selecting piglets were evaluated to obtain the best possible estimation of total milk production from three piglets in each litter. The total milk production of a sow based on three piglets in the litter was obtained from a quadratic model of the relationship between milk intake and daily gain. When the daily gain of all piglets were known the Pearson correlation between milk production determined for the whole litter ( n -1) and only three median piglets was 0.98.

At 9 weeks of age all litters were moved to standard pens for fattening pigs. Behavioural observations and recording of lesions were undertaken at 8 and 12 weeks of age. At 8 weeks piglets weaned in flat decks spent more time lying than those weaned in the farrowing pen (1080 vs. 1026 min per day, p <0.01), and piglets weaned at 6 weeks spent more time lying than those weaned at 4 weeks (1083 vs. 1026 min per day, p <0.01). Direct observations showed that piglets weaned in flat decks were sniffing/rooting pen mates, pen fittings and the floor, and chewing/nibbling pen mates and tail-biting significantly more than piglets weaned in the farrowing pen. The age at weaning was of minor importance for the frequency of these behaviours. At 12 weeks, when moved to standard fattening pens, very few of these differences persisted. However, the frequency of massaging and sucking pen mates was higher amongst piglets weaned at 4 weeks compared to 6 weeks, and also somewhat higher among piglets weaned in farrowing pens compared to flat decks. The piglets weaned in flat decks had a higher frequency of belly and tail lesions than piglets that remained in the farrowing pen. These findings suggest that the post-weaning environment has a major influence on the frequency of abnormal behaviours in weaned piglets, but that the observed differences disappear when the piglets are moved to standard fattening pens with bedding.

Both linear and threshold models were used and provided very similar results for the fixed effects. Conception rate was lowest in latest parities, before 60 days postpartum, in winter and on Mondays. With the linear model, the estimated heritability and repeatability of conception rate were 2 and 3.2%, respectively, and the service bull and herd components contributed 0.8 and 1.1% of the total variance, respectively. All variance components were 60% greater from the threshold model. The correlation between male and female fertility was small and slightly negative (−0.11). In spite of a low heritability, the genetic variability of female fertility was large, with a genetic coefficient of variation of 14%. The genetic correlations between conception rate at first insemination and 100-day yield traits were estimated by REML on 83 606 first lactation data. They were found to be antagonistic, with −0.60, −0.42 and −0.36 for milk, fat and protein yields, respectively, whereas the phenotypic correlations were only slightly negative (−0.02 to −0.04).",

Last year production records from 39 herds were used. We gathered information on specific routines as well as environmental factors by visiting every farm once. Herds practising moderate roughage feeding during pregnancy tended to have lower piglet mortality (p=0.06). Use of farrowing rails along all the sides of the pen resulted in lower piglet mortality than when no rails were present (p<0.01). Herds that hardly used any litter in the sow area at the time of farrowing had significantly higher piglet mortality than herds that used a moderate or large amount (p<0.05). Helping the piglets to obtain colostrum immediately after birth also reduced mortality (p<0.05), whereas other routines such as shutting the piglets inside the creep area while feeding the sow did not have any significant effect.",

Each experiment was carried out in a split plot design with two different forage crops and two types of supplementary feed (typical concentrate for organic layers versus whole wheat) with three replications. In the first experiment the tested forage crops were of a well-established grass/clover and a mixture of forbs (Fagopyrum esculentum, Phacelia tanacetifolia and Linum usitatissimum). In the second experiment the tested forage crops were a well-established grass/clover and chicory (Cichorium intybus cv. Grassland Puna). The results on productivity and egg quality suggest that laying hens consume large amounts of foraging material when accessible. In nutrient restricted hens (wheat-fed) the forage may yield a substantial contribution to the requirements of amino acids and metabolizable energy although productivity parameters and measurements on dry matter in albumen showed that wheat-fed hens, on a short-term basis, were not able to fully compensate for the lack of protein and amino acids by increased foraging. Of the forage crops investigated especially chicory seems to contribute to the nutrition of the hens. Measurements on eggshell parameters showed that oyster shells together with foraging material were sufficient to meet the hens’ calcium requirements. Yolk colour clearly revealed that laying hens consume large quantities of green fodder irrespective of the type of supplementary feed. Yolk colour from hens with access to chicory tended to be darker, of a redder and less yellow hue compared with grass/clover fed hens, which is considered a positive quality.",

Consequently, enteric CH4 emissions are by far the single most important emission source that can be targeted for mitigation within the ruminant production cycle. This review aims to update nutritional and management abatement strategies for enteric methane emissions. Each ruminant production system is unique, and therefore a holistic, life cycle assessment should be considered when determining the potential value of any abatement strategy. It is important to bear in mind that any abatement strategy will only be adopted if it passes regulatory requirements and if there is an economic incentive for its implementation.",

Second, the effect of cow's activity on enteric methane emissions was investigated. During drinking and feeding, cows produced significantly more (p<0.001) methane emissions than when idle. Third, effect of different micrometeorological factors on LMD measurements under outdoor grazing conditions was investigated. Wind speed, relative humidity, pressure and wind direction relative to methane point-source had significant effect on methane measurements (p<0.001) under outdoor conditions. With further validation, the LMD has potential to provide reliable estimates from ruminants and hence provide a useful technique for on-farm monitoring and decision support for greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.",

In broilers, the small-intestinal weight relative to body weight and villous height increase rapidly during the first week after hatch. After the first week, the relative small-intestinal weight decreases gradually, but the villous height continues to increase. In pigs, at 4 d after weaning, villous height decreases to about 60% of the pre-weaning height when weaned between 1 and 4 wk of age. Two weeks after weaning, this recovers to similar values as in unweaned control animals independent of weaning age. Small-intestinal development after hatch and after weaning consistently deteriorates at low feed intake levels and with suboptimal protein nutrition. These findings stress the importance of applying an optimal nutritional strategy in these phases of life to reach optimal small-intestinal development.",

Global assessments of climate change impacts on food production have been made since the early 1990s, initially with little attention to the uncertainties involved. Although there has been abundant analysis of uncertainties in future greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts on the climate system, uncertainties related to the way climate change projections are scaled down as appropriate for different analyses and in modelling crop responses to climate change, have been neglected. This review paper mainly addresses uncertainties in crop impact modelling and possibilities to reduce them. We specifically aim to (i) show ranges of projected climate change-induced impacts on crop yields, (ii) give recommendations on use of emission scenarios, climate models, regionalization and ensemble crop model simulations for different purposes and (iii) discuss improvements and a few 'known unknowns' affecting crop impact projections.",

Nine of the ewes succeeded and there were large individual differences in how they responded. In experiment 2, these nine ewes were kept in a virtual enclosure, with and without a physical fence outside the border, for four days. The ewes stayed inside the intended pasture when the border was kept stationary. Moving the border resulted in the ewes escaping over the virtual border. The results from the study indicate challenges with this virtual system. This has implications for the use of animal virtual fences for commercial sheep production.",

The content of HCl-extracted fat and the amount of gross energy was nearly equal for all the fat sources and as such not related to the variation in fatty acid composition or digestibility. Inclusion of soya oil, which is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, enhanced protein digestibility, whereas inclusion of the other fat sources did not influence protein digestibility. A curvilinear function of fat digestibility (% of intake) to dietary fat concentration was found, thus reflecting the significance of the endogenous fat losses on the determined digestibility value.

However current assessments are based almost entirely on the provision of resources and management consistent with good welfare, they give little attention to the outcome, welfare state itself.

The six diets varied in dietary content of ß‐carotene (5.1 or 10.2 mg kg−1 diet), canthaxanthin (2.0 mg kg−1diet) or retinol (8400 or 16800 IU kg−1 diet). Analyses of blood plasma taken from the live chicken showed no differences in their oxidative status, as regards haemolysis, creatin kinase (CK), glutamic‐oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px). At slaughter α‐tocopherol in plasma (P< 0.01) and liver (P<0.05) decreased with increasing dietary retinol or ß‐carotene levels, whereas analysis of breast and thigh muscles did not show any change. Dietary canthaxanthin caused a decrease in the concentration of retinol in breast muscles (P≤ 0.01), whereas γ‐tocopherol content in thigh muscles (P< 0.001) increased with increasing dietary retinol and ß‐carotene content. Most of the ß‐carotene was converted to retinol at the intestinal mucosa during absorption, and ß‐carotene was detected only in small amounts in the liver. However, canthaxanthin and natural lutein from the feed were both readily absorbed and deposited unchanged in the tissues.

Data analysed comprised farrowings during the period 1994-1997 from 19 Swedish nucleus herds and included 20 275 litters from 6989 purebred sows (3598 L and 3391 Y). Analysis of variance was used for the statistical analysis of quantitative data. Logistic regression analysis was applied for binary data using the GLIMMIX macro in the SAS program. The response variables analysed were litter size, WSI, farrowing rate and remating rate. Explanatory variables included in the analyses were mating type, lactation length, sow breed, boar breed, parity, herd-year combination within breed and month of the year. The effect of WSI on subsequent fertility performance (i.e. litter size, farrowing rate and remating rate) was also analysed. Compared with AI, NM resulted in significantly larger litters (0.2 total born per litter; P<0.001; 0.3 born alive per litter; P<0.001), and lower remating rate (1.6%-units; P<0.01). The difference between NM and AI varied according to sow breed, parity number and month of the year. Subsequent litter sizes decreased by about one piglet when WSI increased from 4 to 10 days. Thereafter, litter size increased as the WSI increased from 10 to 20 days. Farrowing rate decreased gradually when WSI increased from 4 to 7 days, but an increase in WSI from day 9 to day 20 resulted in an increase in farrowing rate. A longer lactation period led to a shorter WSI and a larger subsequent litter size for both breeds.",

We used wide system boundaries, which included all relevant processes occurring both pre-farm and on-farm. Secondly, we assessed a representative production chain for bread, including transport, milling, baking and packing processes. On-farm processes accounted for a large share of the environmental impacts attributable to the production of bread (e.g. 50% for GWP). There is thus considerable potential for environmental improvements through changes in farm management. In total, the GWP per kg of bread (freshweight) was 0.95 kg CO2-equivalent.

The main areas of concern were claw overgrowth, queuing at feeding and hindquarter dirtiness, with larger farms heading higher concerns. Additionally, this paper aimed to investigate indicators' consistency over time. Ten of the 30 farms were revisited four months later, during which no major husbandry changes were made. Our results showed an overall consistency. This study can help define intervention thresholds or minimum legal levels for each indicator, by determining their overall prevalence.KEYWORDS: Animal welfareanimal-based indicatorconsistency over timedairy goatintensive system AcknowledgmentsWe also acknowledge the farmers that kindly allowed us to visit their farms, Carla Marmelo, Inês Barão and Mónica Fonseca for help with data collection, and Inês Ajuda for her valuable comments and helpful discussion along the study.

In total 20 lactating dairy cows, ten Holstein and ten Jerseys were recorded using sniffers installed in milking robots for three weeks of lactation and subsequently in respiration chambers (RC) where they were each recorded on three occasions within the RC. Bivariate linear mixed models were used to determine the individual-level correlations (rI) between sniffer and RC phenotypes as proxies for genetic correlations. Despite differences in feeding and management, the predicted CH4 production from sniffers correlated highly with RC CH4 production rI = 0.77 ± 0.18 and CH4 breath concentration correlated nearly as well with RC CH4 production rI = 0.75 ± 0.20. These correlations between sniffers on-farm and RC demonstrate the potential of sniffers measurements as large-scale indicator traits for CH4 emissions in dairy cattle.",

The protocols differ in composition: the HWAP contains 20 animal-based (35.7%), 28 resource-based (50.0%) and 8 management-based (14.3%) measures whereas the OP has 4 animal-based (8.9%), 21-resource-based (46.7%), 16-management-based (35.6%) and 4-uncategorized measures (8.9%). The HWAP detected more welfare issues than the OP for 11 out of 12 welfare criteria. The OP took less time to assess (2–4 h) compared to the HWAP (3 h 20 min to 8 h 40 min). The added level of detail and more animal-based measures means that the HWAP provides a more thorough assessment of welfare of the individual animal than the OP.KEYWORDS: Animal-based measuresassessment guidanceequine welfarelegislationwelfare officers AcknowledgementsThe study was carried out within the Centre of Excellence in Animal Welfare Science, a Swedish collaborative research environment.

During the first 3 months, the calves were open-field tested at 2 and 10 weeks of age. Calves isolated in closed single pens (SClosed) performed more exploration during the open-field tests at 2 and 10 weeks of age than did calves housed in open single pens (SOpen). During the open-field test after the experimental period at 6 months of age, previously isolated calves (SClosed) had a longer latency to enter an open-field arena, and during a social test at this stage group-reared calves (GCalf and GCow) sniffed and mounted other calves more than calves housed in single pens (SOpen and SClosed). The results suggest that isolation increases the motivation to explore a novel environment, and that housing in groups facilitates the development of normal social responses.",

The experiments were designed to establish what proportion of the total diets the roughages can make up without refusal, and to get preliminary results on the apparent faecal digestibility of diets containing three kinds of roughage. In experiment 1 (exp. 1), the roughage consisted of either fresh or frozen (thawed) clover-grass. In experiment 2 (exp. 2), clover-grass silage and whole-crop pea-barley silage was studied. The faecal digestibility of gross energy (GE), dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), dietary fibre (DF) and crude protein (CP) were measured for pigs fed diets including these roughages. The three roughages, leaves and stems of clover-grass and the basal diets were also tested for in vitro OM digestibility. Roughage intake was similar in both experiments. The average proportion of roughage ingested was 18-19% of DM. There were no differences between fresh and frozen (thawed) clover-grass nutrient digestibility values. Glucose (cellulose) and xylose were the main constituents of the non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in the roughages, with whole-crop pea-barley silage having the highest content. The faecal digestibility of NSP was significantly lower for diets based on whole-crop pea-barley silage compared to clover-grass silage (exp. 2). In both experiments, the GE, DM, OM and CP digestibility did not differ. The in vitro OM digestibility demonstrated superior values for clover-grass leaves compared to the stems.",

The approach pursued in Austria to resolve this problem involves the so-called 'animal needs index' ANI-35. (In German this is known as 'Tiergerechtheitsindex' TGI-35.) This is an instrument for assuring defined welfare standards in livestock housing. The scoring of defined conditions leads to a sum total of points. The ANI totals are divided into ascending housing-condition grades. In this paper the historical interaction between the development of the ANI-35 system and various public attempts to regulate and promote farm animal welfare in Austria are described. It is shown how the ANI-system influenced the emergence of animal welfare norms in Austria and, in a process of feedback, how public discussion strongly improved the broad acceptance of the index. Weak points and possible improvements are discussed. Keywords: Animal Protection LegislationAnimal WelfareOrganic Livestock ProductsWelfare Categories",

In our view these criteria can only be fulfilled by applying a mixture of animal-related parameters, i.e. direct welfare indicators, and indirect housing and human-related parameters, i.e. influencing factors. However, although our knowledge of the effects of individual influencing factors on animal health and well-being is in part well developed, relatively little is known about the effects of the interaction of these factors and their relative importance within the animal's complex environment. We therefore propose to undertake epidemiological research and use multivariate analysis in order to construct assessment models relating to particular aspects of welfare.

Tail-in-mouth behaviour (TIM) among young pigs is probably the precursor of the damaging tail-biting in older pigs. Hence, this experiment aimed to elucidate the frequency of TIM in relation to gender, age and group composition regarding gender in weaner pigs. Pigs were reared in groups of 24 until 5 weeks of age and then divided into three groups: (A) eight female pigs, (B) eight castrated male pigs and (C) four female and four castrated male pigs (mixed pen). Observations was performed through video-recording 12 h per day, 1 day per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. The number of TIM events (counts) as well as the identity of the performer and the receiver of TIM were recorded. The results showed that the level of TIM activity in the single-gender pens was significantly lower than in the mixed pen (P<0.05). In the mixed pen, TIM tended to be more directed towards the opposite gender and female pigs tended to perform more TIM than the males. Finally, the frequency of TIM increased significantly with age in all three pens (P<0.01).",

However, lower litter size and pregnancy rate in group housed compared to individually housed non-lactating sows has been observed in several on-farm studies. Based upon existing knowledge, it is considered whether stress and fear caused by social interactions are possible mediators of impaired reproduction in group housed sows. A review of 15 experiments with group housed sows showed that although the results are few and inconsistent, there are indications that stress and fear may be contributory reasons for the impaired reproduction seen in group housed sows and that possible initiators of stress and fear might be the mixing of unfamiliar sows and high stocking rate levels. A suggestion for indicators of stress and fear related reproduction problems suitable for use in practice are put forward.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reviews the effect of space allowance, feeding space and floor type in loose housing and the effect of tie stalls versus loose housing on voluntary feed intake, daily gain, feed conversion ratio, carcass and meat quality, and health. Possible physiological mechanisms involved in mediating housing-induced differences in performance are discussed. Furthermore, animal well-being, practical implications and need for future research are commented. From the review the following conclusions are made: (1) Reduced space allowance from 4.7 to 1.5 m2 per animal changes feed intake, daily gain and feed conversion ratio to 92, 81 and 115%, respectively, for bulls and steers weighing 250–500 kg. (2) Only minor differences in performance are expected in animals kept on deep bedding and slatted floors when animals are compared at the same space allowance. (3) Reducing space at feed manger to less than one per animal in loose housing systems may reduce performance, but more data are needed to quantify the effects. (4) Compared to tethered animals, loose-housed animals (≥4.7 m2 per animal) eat approximately 4% more and have an approximately 4% higher feed conversion ratio, probably due to increased exercise. (5) Loose-housed animals tend to have a higher conformation score and area of longissimus dorsi, less fat, darker meat and a tendency for tougher meat compared to tethered animals. (6) Loose-housed animals have a higher risk of inflamed legs and hoof problems compared to tethered animals. Loose-housed animals also have a higher risk of liver abscesses when they are fed high amounts of concentrates. A low space allowance on slatted floors increases the risk of tail tip lesions. Differences in performance due to space allowance are probably caused by stress. Stress results in changed levels of a multiplicity of hormones orchestrated by the neuropeptides corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), somatostatin (SS) and the catecholamines. A stress-induced reduction of feed intake may be mediated by increased levels of SS, CRF and possibly insulin, glucagon and gastrin. Evidence for the involvement of GH, ACTH, cortisol and testosterone, however, is weak. The mechanisms mediating stress-induced increase on feed conversion ratios are complex and not well understood in ruminants. However, stress may change the function of the gastrointestinal tract, nutrients absorbed, partitioning of nutrients and metabolism. A number of hormones are involved in these mechanisms, including somatotropic hormones. It is concluded that a low space allowance threatens the well-being of bulls and steers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Within- and across-country genetic parameters need to be estimated prior to an international genetic evaluation of dairy bulls. A procedure based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm to produce restricted maximum likelihood estimates of such parameters, using national evaluation results from different countries, was tested by simulation. Individual performance records were generated for two populations of dairy cattle with separate breeding programmes but considerable genetic exchange to create ties between the populations. A genotype-by-country interaction effect was generated by simulating the data according to a genetic correlation of 90 between performance in the two countries. Within-country national evaluations were computed with animal models. The estimation procedure was tested using bull national evaluation results. The impact of factors such as data connectedness, time period, and bias in national evaluations on estimated parameters was investigated. When all data were included in the analysis, correct estimates of genetic parameters were obtained. When older data were excluded, within-country variance estimates were biased downwards. When national evaluations of imported bulls, often considered biased owing to preferential treatment of daughters, were excluded, the genetic correlation was underestimated by 12%. When 5-15% bias was introduced into the evaluations of imported bulls in one country and the latter were included in the estimation procedure, genetic correlations were only slightly underestimated. When genetic links between populations were weakened, the genetic correlation was seriously underestimated. A better estimate was then obtained based only on a well-connected subset of the data instead of the entire dataset. The procedure was tested on real data from five countries: Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States of America. Genetic correlation estimates between production traits in these countries ranged from .90 to .97.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of various feeding levels from weaning (day 28) to day 170 of age on growth, muscularity and technological meat quality in female pigs. From day 28 to day 90 of age (growing period) and from day 90 to day 170 of age (finishing period), the pigs were fed either ad libitum (A) or restrictively (R) in a 2 2 2 factorial design with treatments named AA, AR, RA and RR. In the growing period, the growth rate of A pigs was 35% higher than that of R pigs. In the finishing period, the growth rate was dependent on the feed intake in the growing period, i.e. pigs fed restrictively in the growing period had 6-8% higher growth rate in the finishing period (RA and RR) than pigs fed ad libitum in the growing period (AA and AR). Furthermore, despite RA pigs being 11 kg lighter at day 90 of age they produced as much muscle tissue at slaughter as did AA pigs, but less subcutaneous fat, which resulted in a 5% higher meat content of the carcass. The increased muscle growth of RA pigs in the finishing period (compensatory growth) was probably accomplished by increased satellite cell proliferation (muscle DNA accumulation) and increased capacity for protein synthesis, as indicated by a higher RNA concentration. Feeding level did not affect the lightness of meat, the ultimate pH or the drip loss. However, a change in feeding level at day 90 of age (RA and AR) led to a reduction in meat redness. The present data suggest that feed restriction in the growing period results in compensatory growth of muscle tissue in the finishing period if ad libitum feeding was applied during this period, accomplished by increased satellite cell proliferation and increased capacity for protein synthesis, without significantly affecting the technological meat quality.",

Analysis of variance was used to compare concentrations of analysed milk variables between SRB and SLB or between SLB and SDM. Concentration of total protein, total casein, β-casein and κ-casein were significantly higher in SRB milk compared with SLB milk. Concentration of α-lactalbumin and calcium were significantly higher in SDM milk than in SLB milk. The concentration of urea was higher in SLB than in SDM milk and is suggested to reflect differences in feeding regimes between the investigated Swedish and Danish herd.",

The parameters used to describe rennet coagulation of 81 milk samples were rennet coagulation time (RCT, Formagraph, and R, Optigraph) and curd firmness 30 min after the addition of rennet (E30, Formagraph, and A30, Optigraph). New Optigraph system recipes were found: R slope = 1.784 and R offset = − 2.303. Using the above Optigraph system recipes, no statistically significant differences were found in rennet coagulation time measurements in either of the studied methods. Regarding curd firmness, the best approximation to describe the relationship between the methods was polynomial: E30= − 0.0357*A30 2+2.8795*A30 −5.2991 (R 2 =0.925). Such strong correlations indicate that the two techniques for detecting milk coagulation properties are comparable and that the data obtained by these methods allow for data interpretation in studies using either method.

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of oil sources in the diet on milk yield, milk composition, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in mid-lactating dairy cows. Forty-eight Chinese Holstein dairy cows averaging 150 days in milk (DIM) at the start of the experiment (body weight = 596±19 kg; milk yield = 29.7±3.00 kg/d) were used in a completely randomized block design. The animals were assigned into four dietary treatments according to DIM and milk yield, and supplemented with no oil (control), 2% flaxseed oil (FSO), 2% soybean oil (SBO), and 2% oil from extruded soybeans (ESB). The experiment lasted nine weeks including the first week for adaptation. Milk yields, milk compositions (fat, protein, and lactose), and milk FA profiles were measured. Daily milk yield from cows fed with FSO, SBO, and ESB were higher than milk yield of the control cows (27.0, 27.0, and 26.5 vs. 25.4 kg/d). Milk fat percentage of the control cows was greater than those cows fed with oil-supplemented diets. However, increasing dietary fat content resulted with no change in fat-corrected milk yield. The FA profile of milk was changed by fat supplementation. Feeding oil reduced the proportion of both short-chain (C8:0 to C12:0) and medium-chain (C14:0 to C16:1) FAs, and increased the proportion of long-chain (≥C18:0) FAs in milk fat. Cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in milk fat was increased from 0.38% for the control to 0.79, 1.51, and 1.56% of fat for the cows supplemented with FSO, SBO, and ESB, respectively. Feeding oils rich in linoleic acid (SBO and ESB) was more effective in enhancing cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk fat than oils containing linolenic acid (FSO). There was a linear relationship between transvaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk. Overall, feeding the FSO, SBO, and ESB diets increased monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased the saturated fatty acid in milk fat.",

Supplementation with 1 g histidine per kg feed gave a 64% increase in carnosine, and about 10% increase in anserine in the muscle. The standard broiler feed concentrate now in use in Norway seems to contain less histidine than what may be needed for optimal synthesis of carnosine and anserine. These dipeptides have important roles as antioxidants, pH buffering agents and anti-glycation agents. They may have important roles in meat for increasing its stability, shelf life and antioxidant capacity, and it might be speculated that broiler meat rich in anserine and carnosine in the future will be considered a type of functional food, having possible health-beneficial effects. Histidine supplementation of standard Norwegian broiler feed concentrate should be considered.

Eleven morphological traits were measured on a total of 296 adult sheep of both sexes randomly selected in Nasarawa State, north-central Nigeria. The univariate analysis showed that Uda rams had significantly (P<0.05) higher values in nine of the morphological traits examined. Measurements that were best able to separate the rams and the ewes as revealed by the canonical discriminant analysis were head width and face length. These two variables were included in the single discriminant function used to classify the two sexes. The discriminant model was able to allocate correctly 70.8% of Uda ewes and 58% of rams to their a priori sexes. Ward's option of the cluster analysis further revealed the morphological distinctness of the population. The discriminant function obtained in the present study could be useful in management, ecological and conservation studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The influence of rapeseed oil on digestibility, energy metabolism and tissue composition in growing pigs was determined. Rapeseed oil (0, 4, 8 and 16%) was added to a soyabean meal and barley basal diet. Essential amino acids relative to net energy (NE) were kept constant by adjusting with crystalline amino acids. Rapeseed oil has a high content of the unsaturated fatty acids 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, and is rich in natural tocopherols, which act as antioxidants. The apparent protein digestibility was enhanced with increasing levels of rapeseed oil. Improving the ratio of essential to non-essential amino acids decreased nitrogen execretion in faeces and urine by 21% and 26%, respectively. The amount of digestible fat increased from 29 to 218 g day−1 from the control diet to the diet with 16% rapeseed oil, resulting in a fat retention of 195 to 213 g day−1. This demonstrates the ability of pig for de novo synthesis of fatty acids. The digestibility of the rapeseed oil was high (92.7), and the metabolizable energy (ME) content of rapeseed oil was 38.28 MJ ME kg−1. The net energy value of the rapeseed oil corresponded to 3.66 kg air dry barley. Higher intakes of unsaturated fatty acids in rapeseed oil were reflected in the body tissue composition of both depot fat and intramuscular fat of the pigs. The fatty acid composition of these tissues became more unsaturated with respect to 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 as well as 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3. Arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) increased slightly in leaf fat but tended to decrease in M. longissimus dorsi and M. biceps femoris, where docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) in leaf fat was unaffected by dietary rapeseed oil level. In the analysed muscles 22:6n-3 tended to decrease with increasing dietary rapeseed oil level.",

Despite marginal N deficiencies for the control diet (B), BU did not affect milk yield, ruminal fibre digestion or omasal total non-ammonia-N (NAN) or microbial NAN flow. In contrast, BRM and BRC diets significantly increased milk and milk protein yields and omasal dietary NAN flows. Effects of rapeseed meal (RSM) and rapeseed cake (RSC) on milk yield and omasal NAN flow were similar. The diets had no effect on rumen microbial protein synthesis. In general, non-protein N and soluble true protein comprised 0.20 of omasal total NAN flow, for all diets. Supplementary AAT from rapeseed feeds appeared to escape from the rumen as insoluble feed particles.",

Five-minute time samples were carried out on 11 days across lactation between morning feeding and afternoon milking. Cows fed the low concentrate diet spent more time eating, more time ruminating whilst standing, and less time lying, especially inactive. Genetic line did not affect the time budget of the cows. Standing and rumination decreased with time from calving, whereas the duration of lying bouts increased during the first 3 months of lactation. In this study the time budget of dairy cows was influenced by food roughage inclusion, and not by the production level of the animal.",

The cage designs were Get-away cages (GA) with 15 hens per cage, a special version of the \"Edinburgh modified cage\" called \"Modified and enriched cage\" (ME) with 4 ISA or 5 Leghorn hens per cage, conventional cages of metal (CO) with 4 hens per cage and conventional cages of plastic (PL) with 3 hens per cage.

Shaver had a significantly lower live weight than Dekalb and LSL, while ISA was significantly heavier than LSL. Production in ME was similar to that in conventional cages and, in Trial 2, birds in ME, CO and PL produced significantly better than those in GA. The highest mortality was registered in GA, where in Trial 2 it was significantly higher than in ME. GA gave a significantly higher and CO a lower proportion of cracked eggs than ME and PL. In both trials ME gave significantly lower proportions of dirty eggs than GA and in Trial 2, the lowest. Few differences between the systems were registered regarding interior egg quality.

Two groups of 19 Red Danish heifers were given the same amount of net energy in diets with either low or high energy concentration from 3 months of age. The average daily gain (ca. 500 g) was similar at the two diets. Nine heifers from each group were designated for slaughter at different live weights (range 139–383 kg) for estimation of mammary growth. Compared at the average body weight at slaughter (250 kg) the least-square means of mammary gland weights, extra-parenchymal tissue weights and parenchymal tissue weights of the groups fed low and high energy density rations were 1201±79 vs. 1162±84 (p>0.20), 789±63 vs. 698±67 (p>0.20) and 412±44 vs. 464±47 (p>0.20), respectively. In line with this there was no significant difference in the amount of milk produced by the cows raised on a low or high energy diet (16.7±1.0 vs. 16.8±1.0 kg 4% fat corrected milk; p>0.20). The amount of mammary parenchyma increased linearly with live weight (b = 3.08 g; P<0.001). Plasma concentrations of growth hormone, insulin or prolactin were not significantly affected by treatment. Plasma growth hormone concentration was positively correlated with amount of mammary parenchyma (r=0.61; p<0.01). From the results it can be concluded that mammary growth and milk production capacity in heifers is unaffected by ration energy density when the heifers are raised at a low feeding level.",

At 35 and 55 weeks of age birds were scored for the appearance of bumble foot, toe pad hyperkeratosis, keel bone lesions, claw length, foot hygiene and hygiene of perch and cage floor (Get-away cages). Birds' use of perches was recorded by visual observation. Expt. 1 made use of a circular profile perch with flattened upper and lower surfaces made of European beech hardwood or of plastic, and Expt. 2 utilized the same hardwood perch and the same design but with a reduced diameter covered with a 4 mm rubber layer. All perches had equal exterior measurements, 38 × 33 mm. Bumble foot and keel bone lesions appeared only in Get-away cages and toe pad hyperkeratosis only in conventional cages. Scores for bumble foot were significantly different between all three white hybrids and between LSL and ISA, always being inferior in LSL. In Expt. 1, the plastic perch resulted in more bumble foot than the hardwood design. In Expt. 2 there was no significant effect of perch design on toe pad hyperkeratosis, keel bone lesions or bumble foot. Hygiene of feet was better in conventional cages than in Get-away cages. Although artificial materials were easier to keep clean than hardwood perches, it is concluded that plastic is not a suitable material because it increases the incidence of bumble foot, and that a soft rubber cover does not reduce bumble foot or keel bone lesions compared with plain European beech hardwood perches of equal diameter. Significant interaction effects between hybrid and perch design/keeping system, especially regarding bumble foot and toe pad hyperkeratosis, indicate that genotypes are differently adapted to environmental designs in terms of the clinical health aspects studies.

For low-protein feedstuff's, “apparent” values relate directly to the feedstuff and are accurate estimates of net digestibility. For diluted protein-rich feedstuffs, apparent values underestimate the net digestibility, which, however, can be obtained from apparent digestibility by mathematical extrapolation. “True” digestibility values have traditionally been obtained by correcting ileal digesta flows for endogenous protein determined after feeding an N-free mixture. Such values are not affected by the protein content of the test diet (degree of dilution) but are generally underestimated and influenced by the amount of endogenous protein loss induced by the N-free mixture. True digestibility determined using enzyme hydrolysed casein includes the minimal or “basal” endogenous loss induced by protein-containing feedstuffs and is, by definition, not influenced by different N-free mixtures used to dilute the experimental mixtures. Real digestibilities (including in vitro measures) are direct measures of the digestibility of a feed protein, and are not influenced by endogenous loss. Values for apparent and real protein and amino acid digestibility are. not directly suitable for use in practical protein evaluation systems but those for net or true digestibility can be used. Both sets of values can be calculated from determinations of either real or apparent digestibility. For net digestibility, total endogenous protein loss is included in the digestibility coefficients. For true digestibility, only the extra endogenous loss is included in the digestibility coefficients while the basal endogenous loss needs to be standardized and included in the estimate of amino acid requirements.",

In littered systems the prevalence of callosities was significantly lower. Callosities were positively correlated with decubital lesions. This investigation showed that lesion patterns on the skin do act as indicators of welfare.

The latter diet was the 159 g CP/kg diet supplemented with dispensable amino acids, to study the effect of excess CP. Week 4 included use of metabolic cages. Feed intake, gain and feed utilisation were not significantly affected. Plasma urea (P < 0.001) and urinary nitrogen (P = 0.01) decreased linearly by lowering CP. The weight of the carcass tended to increase linearly by reducing CP, but neither nitrogen retention nor carcass meat percentage and back fat depth differed among treatments. In conclusion, the study indicated that CP could be decreased to 136 g/kg as-fed for growing pigs in the weight range 50–100 kg without negative impact on growth performance and carcass traits. Moreover, leanness was not affected by excess CP.",

The degree of self-sufficiency not accounting for use of imported feeds was high for most livestock products but showed a decreasing trend. Animal yields and use of concentrates (with a higher energy and protein content) increased, implying increased feed ingredients import. Agriculture is a source of greenhouse gases (GHG). Country-specific emissions ranged from 8% to 15% of total emissions. Future Nordic livestock production needs to focus on implementing climate smart agriculture to accommodate human population growth and climate change. This includes increased degree of self-sufficiency based on domestic feed resources and increased animal productivity while reducing the environmental impact by lowering GHG emissions. However, more knowledge on how to adapt to the changing conditions and the different trade-offs that are involved is highly needed.",

The results showed a higher proportion of management- and resource-based requirements than animal-based in all regulations. However, the borders between these categories were not as distinct as expected. The private standards put slightly more emphasis on the animal-based requirements and on animal welfare at herd level. It was primarily the organic standard that included higher animal welfare demands than the legislation. Due to vague wording and guideline statements it was not always clear if the welfare level achieved would be the same in practice although the requirements were similar. It will be necessary to clearly distinguish between requirements and measures to make the policy process more transparent.",

Underweight and crushing was the most common causes. For crushing, during 1–3 days after birth, an interaction between sow age and farrowing system was observed, with differences between farrowing systems only for intermediate-aged and older sows (>parity 2). There were no significant differences between systems regarding farrowing duration or number of stillborn pigs, but a significant increase in farrowing problems was recorded for TC-sows.",

Three hundred 1-day old broiler chicks were randomly distributed to four treatments as follows: positive control (without DEX), negative control (NC, with DEX) and NC + 30 and 60 mg/kg ML. Melatonin supplementation at the level of 60 mg improved the growth performance, and antioxidant status of stressed birds. The DEX-induced effect on IL-6 and IL-10 was ameliorated by ML supplementation. The heterophil, and activities of AST, ALT and ALP were decreased by ML supplementation.

The cows were divided into two groups, one early inseminated and the other late inseminated. The cows in the early group were inseminated at first oestrus 50 days after calving, aiming at a conventional 12-month calving interval, and the second group 140 days after calving, aiming at an extended calving interval of 15 months. Effects were studied by mixed-model analysis. Compared with the 12-month groups, total milk yield increased by 15-16% in the extended calving interval groups of both breeds, while fat, protein and lactose contents were slightly lower. The duration of lactation was 55-60 days longer in the 15-month than in the 12-month groups of both breeds. Given the possibility of a longer lactation, primiparous cows generally maintained their production longer than multiparous cows. SLB cows, especially those with a high peak yield, maintained their production longer than SRB cows. Average milk production per day within a calving interval tended to be slightly lower (2-5%) in both breeds when the interval was extended, owing to longer periods with low production and longer dry periods.",

Two hybrids were used: ISA Brown and Lohmann selected Leghorn. Production, interior and exterior egg quality, health, plumage, keel bone and foot condition were studied. The high-wheat diet resulted in inferior plumage condition owing to feather pecking, especially in the Leghorn hybrid, which in turn probably caused the higher feed consumption recorded. No other effects on production or egg quality traits were observed. Mortality, cannibalism, keel bone condition and foot condition were far more affected by housing system and hybrid than by diet. The highest mortality, mainly caused by cloacal cannibalism, was registered for ISA Brown in aviaries.",

The aim of this study was to investigate how these changes affect milk production and milk fat composition, in cows selected for high (HFI) or low (LFI) milk fat content producing the same yield of 4% fat-corrected milk. Furthermore, two different concentrates, with high or low inclusion of soya oil, were studied. The experiment was conducted with 44 multiparous mid-lactating cows over a 4 week period. Samples of milk and blood were obtained before turnout to pasture, during transition to pasture and when cows were adapted to pasture. Milk yield decreased with 3.6 kg energy-corrected milk (ECM) on average during the first 5 days after turnout to pasture. This decrease, together with a drop in plasma insulin and increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), indicated nutritional insufficiency at turnout to pasture. Milk fat composition changed towards more long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and fewer de novo synthesized fatty acids. This was probably caused by an increased supply of LCFA of feed and body origin to the udder. LFI cows showed higher levels of conjugated linoleic acid at pasture than HFI cows.

The absorption of intact glucosinolates in the form of active and passive transport across the intestinal wall was investigated in vitro using the intestine of rat and hamster as everted sacs. Individual glucosinolates as well as rapeseed meal with and without heat inactivation of myrosinase activity were used for the experiments. Analyses were based on HPLC and HPCE after group separation, purification and concentration of intact glucosinolates and their on-column desulfatation products. The in vivo experiments showed 3- to 20-fold lower concentrations of glucosinolates in the content from the stomach and the first parts of the small intestine compared to the concentrations in the applied feed. The glucosinolate concentrations increased again in contents from the distal part of the small intestine, and were reduced to very low values in contents from caecum and colon, with great variations between the individual animals. In vitro studies of glucosinolate degradation during 24 h periods revealed limited degradations when tissue homogenates of the stomach and small intestine and contents therein were used, whereas appreciable degradations were found when the caecum and/or colon contents were used. Heat inactivation of myrosinase activity in the rapeseed meal fed to a group of rats did not affect in vitro glucosinolate degradation in contents from stomach or small intestine, whereas the degradation seemed to be prevented in contents from caecum or colon, indicating an effect from dietary fibres or myrosinase associated to the dietary fibres. None of the glucosinolates was absorbed actively across the intestinal walls in vitro for any parts of the gastrointestinal tract investigated, as found with glucose, whereas passive or facilitated transport was found to be appreciable. The presence of glucosinolates did not affect the active glucose transport. The results obtained showed an appreciable in vivo absorption of intact glucosinolates in the upper gastrointestinal tract and degradation/transformation of the remaining glucosinolates in the distal gastrointestinal tract of rats.",

At live weights below 250 kg heifers had higher feed intake capacities (IC) than bulls, and IC of steers was intermediary. Above 250 kg live weight sex differences in IC were small and not significant. The results support the hypothesis that early maturing animals (heifers and steers) have a higher IC than late maturing animals (bulls) at low live weight. Gestation decreases IC during the last 14 weeks of pregnancy and IC was depressed by 1.5% per week. During the last couple of weeks before calving the depression in IC may be even higher. The depression in IC is due to both physical limitation of the reticulorumen and gastrointestinal tract and hormonal regulation.

Paternal half-brothers of the heifers were tested from 6 weeks to 11 months of age on a high concentrate or on a roughage diet. For prepubertal feed intake, growth and efficiency of feed utilization of heifers, breed and rearing intensity effects were important, but breed x rearing intensity interactions were non-significant or inconsistent. Breed and rearing intensity effects were important but their interaction was not for precalving weight gain, calving weight, milk yield, and feed intake and efficiency during lactation. Females of the larger breeds ate more, grew more rapidly, were heavier and produced more energy corrected milk than Danish Jerseys; but breeds did not differ for efficiency of nutrient utilization during lactation or for post-partum weight change patterns. Increased prepubertal daily gains induced by higher-energy diets were associated with lower subsequent milk yield and reduced energy intake during lactation. The RD, DF and RW bulls ate more and grew more rapidly than DJ bulls. Daily energy intake and gain were higher for concentrate-fed than for roughage-fed bulls. Breed and dietary energy level did not interact significantly for these traits. In conclusion, there was little evidence that Danish dairy and dual-purpose cattle breeds differed in the sensitivity of their subsequent milk yield to excessive rates of gain during the rearing period or in response of young bulls to high concentrate versus roughage diets.",

The present paper deals with the effects of a SCFA burst feeding strategy on epithelial transport function in dry cows. The epithelial transport capacity for [14C]butyrate and Na+ across the rumen epithelium in vitro was significantly increased by the SCFA burst feeding strategy, compared with the controls. The transport of Cl- was significantly increased by the SCFA burst feeding strategy at the high feeding level, but non-significantly decreased at the low feeding level. The increase in transport capacity could not be attributed to changes in epithelial resistance, to the concentration of Na+/K+-ATP-ase or to the epithelial surface area and structure (data on epithelial surface area and structure were published by Andersen et al., Report No. 23 from the National Institute of Animal Science, Denmark, 1994). The observed changes in transport must reflect a change in either composition of the cell membranes or processes that facilitate transport through the cell, including metabolic processes. The presented results support the existence of a saturable SCFA transport system in the epithelial cells and the results show that the capacity of this transport system can be the subject for feed-induced regulation.",

In addition, the effects of growth stage, wilting and ensiling additives on content were studied. Birdsfoot trefoil raw material and silage contained only traces of phytoestrogens. In red clover raw material and silage, the phytoestrogen content varied from 0.8% to 1.1% of dry matter. Content was affected by growth stage of the plant and wilting. Formononetin concentration decreased as the plant matured from budding to flowering stage, and wilting from 25% to 40% of dry matter content decreased genistein and biochanin A content. The phytoestrogen content of red clover silage was 18% higher than that of raw material. Silage additives also affected the content. Silage ensiled with an additive containing Lactobacillus plantarum bacterial inoculate had higher concentrations of genistein and biochanin A than silage made with formic acid.",

    "abstract": "In an experiment including 2400 layers, a diet with 40% whole oats incorporated into 3 mm pellets (experimental diet) was compared with a complete diet, also as 3 mm pellets, but containing no whole oats (control diet). These diets were examined in conventional 3-hens cages and two furnished cage systems with 8 or 16 birds per group including nest, perches and litter. The effects of diet, rearing condition and cage system on performance, plumage condition, comb lesions and rear body wounds were studied. Furthermore, the effect of feed structure on gizzard characteristics and interactions with access to litter during rearing and laying periods were examined. The hybrids LSL and Shaver 2000 were included in the experiment. Egg production was lower (P<0.05) in furnished cages than in conventional cages. No difference in plumage condition was found between diets, but a significantly poorer plumage condition (P<0.05) was observed with increasing group size. Also, the frequencies of rear body (P<0.05) wounds increased as the group sizes increased, while no such effect was observed for comb lesions. Higher (P<0.05) feed consumption was observed in furnished cages than in the conventional, causing a corresponding increase (P<0.05) in feed conversion rate (FCR). Higher (P<0.05) FCR was observed for birds fed pellets with whole oats than the control. Whole oats also increased (P<0.05) the weight of gizzard and gizzard contents. For LSL, better (P<0.05) plumage condition was found for birds reared on a deep litter floor compared to cage rearing. It was concluded that no beneficial effect of replacing high amounts of ground oats with whole oats was observed. Genotype and rearing method may interact with housing system.",

We also studied the combined effect of live weight and dietary supplement of raw potato starch (RPS) on technological meat quality for both sexes, and boar taint compounds in entire male pigs. Furthermore, we investigated pre-slaughter routines (pen-wise or mixing with unfamiliar pigs) and sexual maturity. A total of 408 growing/finishing pigs were included in this two-year study. Performance did not differ significantly between entire male and female pigs irrespective of rearing system, except for daily weight gain in the interval from 90 kg to slaughter. Mixed pigs had significantly higher daily weight gain in this interval than single-sex pigs. Entire male pigs had higher carcass lean meat content than female pigs (1.6 percentage units). Technological meat quality differed only slightly between the sexes. Females reared in mixed pens were sexually more mature than female pigs reared in single-sex pens, and mature females had higher growth rate but lower meat content in carcasses than immature females. In contrast, female contact did not influence sexual maturity of entire male pigs. Mixing entire male pigs with unfamiliar pigs at the abattoir resulted in more damaged skin compared with pen-wise keeping whereas female pigs had almost no visible skin damage. We therefore recommend that entire male pigs are not mixed with unfamiliar pigs during transport and at the abattoir, because of fighting and subsequent skin damage. The levels of skatole in fat were significantly lower in high-weight entire male pigs fed RPS compared to high-weight pigs without RPS. Androstenone levels in fat were high in all groups.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study was carried out to investigate the effects of individual versus combined housing systems on behavioural and growth responses of dairy calves in order to test the hypothesis that when calves were kept in early age individually and later in groups, they would increase growth performance and social behaviours. Twenty-four Holstein Friesian calves were allocated to two different housing systems. After three days of colostrum feeding, individually housed (IH) calves were kept in pens (1 m×1.5 m) for 60 days while combined housed (CH) calves were kept in group pens (3 m×3 m) for 30 days after individual housing during the period of 4–33 days. Each calf was monitored twice a week for a period of 1 h starting at 08.00, 10.00, 12.00, 18.00, 20.00 and 22.00 h at 10-min intervals. Behavioural activities were playing, walking, licking objects, idle standing, lying, restlessness, grooming and tongue playing. Calves' live weights, body measurements and feed intakes were determined on a weekly basis. The results were: 1) combined housing calves increased their calf starter intake (37.35±1.24 kg vs. 23.39±0.86 kg; p<0.001), alfalfa hay intake (8.76±0.35 kg vs. 7.14±0.43 kg; p<0.05) and total feed intake (46.11±1.04 kg vs. 30.53±0.86 kg; p<0.001) compared to individual housed calves; 2) combined housing increased the proportional events of playing (12.80 vs. 2.86%), walking (19.14 vs. 3.81%) and grooming (8.06 vs. 4.60%), but decreased licking objects (1.03 vs. 2.94%), idle standing (20.73 vs. 36.29%), lying (30.19 vs. 39.53%) and restlessness (1.69 vs. 3.47%) compared to individual housing systems (p<0.001) without affecting tongue rolling (6.36 vs. 6.50%); 3) combined housing system increased body weight gain by about 2.36 kg and body length by about 1.48 cm per calf compared to those kept in individual pens (p<0.05). In conclusion, combined housing system provided calves more opportunity to show their walking, playing and grooming activities, reflecting increases in feed intake, body weight gain and length compared to individual housing system.

The behaviour of 128 pigs was observed through video recordings. Pigs fed intact or chopped silage spent a larger proportion of their time active compared with pigs fed silage in pelleted form or fed only cereal-based feed. There was a trend for pigs fed silage in pelleted form or fed only cereal-based feed to respond strongly to social interactions more often than pigs fed intact or chopped silage, irrespective of initial performing pig behaviour. Pigs in groups fed intact silage had a lower number of wounds from violent social interactions on their bodies. Thus, additional provision of silage in an environment enriched with straw can further improve pig welfare.",

    "abstract": "The milk fat depression (MFD) syndrome is a phenomenon consisting in a reduction of milk fat content below the expected values according to stage of lactation and production level, even at levels below milk protein content, which is the opposite of the normal situation. Typical diets inducing MFD include the provision of significant quantities of concentrate or lipids inclusion. In grazing animals it is possible to observe MFD at certain critical times of the year, without the intervention of concentrated diets or external supply of lipids. There are particular circumstances, especially at the beginning of spring and autumn, or in grazing systems that favor a high selection in pasture by cows, that promote the appearance of MFD without the use of concentrated diets or lipid supplementation. In such circumstances a low level of fiber in pasture (or in the portion consumed by livestock) and a significant consumption of unsaturated fatty acids is expected, characteristic of young pastures, which have a higher proportion of leaves and lower levels of structural carbohydrates. This paper gives an account of the conditions that promote the syndrome and examines the mechanisms involved, under the situation of grazing cows.",

Four different feeding systems were tested: one dry feeder, four dry feeders, trough feeding or one wet/dry feeder per pen of 16 pigs, respectively. The one dry feeder treatment led to an increase in skin injuries, a more spread feed intake pattern, an increased variation in carcass meat percentage and an increased variation in daily weight gain (DWG) when the pigs were restrictively fed, compared with observations for the pigs in the four dry feeders treatment. The effect of a reduced number of feeding places was most pronounced when the pigs were fed restrictively. Besides the possible negative financial effects for pig producers, these findings indicated that competition for feed impaired the well-being of the pigs. Pigs fed in a trough had a lower DWG and higher feed conversion ratio than did those fed using four dry feeders, probably due to feed spillage and the different feed intake pattern. Giving pigs the possibility of adding water to the feed increased the daily feed intake when feeding ad libitum, resulting in a higher DWG. It also reduced the negative effects of competition on performance, but not the negative effects on skin injuries.",

Half of the pigs came from four commercial pig units with tethered or otherwise confined sows, 4 weeks' weaning, little space per piglet and no use of straw. The other half of the pigs came from another four commercial units with loose-housed sows, 5-6 weeks' weaning and liberal space and use of straw. Half of the piglets from each of the units were tail docked. At an average weight of 33.5 kg the pigs were transferred to environmentally rich experimental pens where they stayed until slaughter at approx. 100 kg liveweight. On 8 observation days evenly distributed during the fattening period the pigs' use of the straw sections of the experimental pens was recorded as well as oral activities directed towards pen mates, including tail biting. The pigs' use of the pen's straw section declined significantly (p < 0.005) during the fattening period. The rearing environment had a significant effect on nibbling on pen mates (p <0.04) but not on tail biting. The nibbling on pen mates decreased (p < 0.02) while tail biting increased (p < 0.03) during the fattening period. The tail status had no significant effect on either of the two behavioural parameters. Neither rearing environment nor tail status influenced the relative growth rate. Pigs recruited from the \"barren\" environment showed an almost statistically significant higher incidence of chronic pleuritis (p = 0.069).",

    "abstract": "The welfare of production animals can be improved by adapting the production system to the needs of the animals and/or by selecting those animals best adapted to the production system. As no documented improvements of mink welfare resulting from altered housing are readily available, a temperament test (the stick test) is now being applied for use under commercial farm conditions. The test, categorising the mink as fearful, exploratory or aggressive when a stick is inserted into the cage, has been developed and used for selection under experimental conditions. It has been demonstrated that the temperaments categorised in the stick test are related to reactions in novel object and intruder tests as well as to cortisone response to handling. In order to facilitate the use of the stick test in practice, it has been simplified and implemented on six Danish mink farms. On average, 60% of adult mink females were characterised as exploratory in August, but the percentage differed between farms. After 30 minutes of training, the farmers were able to perform the stick test with 74–100% agreement in results with an experienced tester. In order to improve welfare at farm level, a selection line of 200 exploratory females is established on each farm for the mating season in March 2000. During the first three years of selection, the effects of the behavioural selection on other welfare indicators, such as health, behaviour and production, will be monitored.

    "abstract": "Abstract Indicators of stress, behaviour in the pen, and lesions of the integument were used as indicators of sow well-being in a comparison of group housing with electronic sow feeding [GH] and confinement in gestation crates [C] in experiment 1, which included 2 × 4 groups of 20–25 sows. Effects of earlier experience with a gestation system on the indicators of stress was investigated in experiment 2, which included 2 × 3 groups of 20–25 sows. Reaction in a novelty test and reactivity in plasma Cortisol to the procedure of blood sampling were used as indicators of stress. Behaviour in the pen as well as lesions of the integument revealed that both gestation systems were suboptimal in some manner. However, following acclimatization for 1–2 weeks, young GH sows experienced less stress than young C sows as measured by reduced fear in the novelty test. In experiment 2 this interpretation was further supported by lower reactivity in plasma Cortisol. It was concluded that sow well-being was higher for the majority of the gestation period in young group-housed animals. Thus, in spite of the inadequate feeding method, well-being of sows may be improved in group housing systems with electronic sow feeding if the system is well functioning with low levels of aggression and vulva bites. One of the major determinants of vulva biting is suggested to be the mechanism of gate control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The efficacy of phytase supplement, 1200 U/kg, produced by Aspergillus niger on phytin phosphorus (P) availability was assayed in a 6 × 6 Latin square designed digestibility and balance trial with growing pigs at live weight 35–88 kg. The pigs were fed on barley-soybean meal diets without inorganic P either soaked for 3 h or without soaking. The P content of the control diet with added inorganic P was 6.5 g and that of unsupplemented diets 3.7 g/kg. The calcium content was 8.0 g/kg in all diets, and in the composition of other nutrients, the diets were equal. Soaking of the meal had no effect on digestibility of any nutrient. The digestibility of ash in a diet supplemented with phytase was improved (P<0.001). There were no differences in any organic constituent digestibility between the treatments. No effect on nitrogen utilization was found as a result of phytase addition or soaking. The addition of microbial phytase improved (P<0.001) the apparent absorption of P to 0.64 as compared to the unsupplemented 0.45. The retained P, on average 4.9 g/d in diets with supplementary phytase, was significantly higher (P<0.001) than that without, 3.7 g/d. In pigs fed a diet with additional inorganic P, the retention of P was 5.5 g/d. P retention in terms of daily amount of intake was greater (P<0.001) in diets with added phytase than without (0.58 vs. 0.44). From the diet with inorganic P supplementation a significantly lower value, 0.38 (P<0.001) was achieved than from the unsupplemented diets. Calcium digestibility and retention tended to be higher in phytase-treated diets. Owing to its effect on phytate P availability in a barley-soybean meal diet, phytase treatment of feedstuffs allows a greater proportion of the pig's P requirement to be met by P of plant origin and results in reduced losses of dietary P in faeces and urine.",

The experiment comprised the following four treatments: trough feeding, four dry feeders, one dry feeder and one wet/dry feeder per 16 pigs, respectively. Performance, skin injuries, plasma cortisol, agonistic behaviour, ingestive behaviour and activity were studied. The effect of competition for feed was most clearly evident for the small pigs. The small animals in the one dry feeder treatment were forced to eat more during the night, had more forced withdrawals from the feeder, and tended to have more scratches and skin injuries than did the small animals in the four dry feeder treatment. It was concluded that this competition led to impaired well-being in the smallest pigs. No significant differences were detected in plasma cortisol levels, when comparing the different feeding systems within each pig size category. Trough feeding greatly affected pig feed intake pattern: during the growing period when pigs had ad libitum access to feed, the pigs fed in a trough ate mostly at feeding times, while the pigs in the four dry feeder treatment ate at times spread out over the entire 24 h period. It was concluded that there was a confounding effect between pig size category (small or large) and feeding system with regard to ingestive behaviour and aggressive interactions at feeding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tail-in-Mouth (TIM) behaviour has occasionally been observed among pigs living under semi-natural conditions. It is therefore considered to be a normal, low-frequency behaviour. Under certain conditions, TIM behaviour may increase in frequency and progress into tail biting per se. Several factors, such as age, gender, and size, are believed to enhance this development. This study aimed to elucidate the frequency of TIM behaviour among slaughter pigs, specifically in relation to age, gender, size, and group composition regarding gender. Similarly, we intended to characterize the motivational context in which TIM behaviour occurs. Two batches consisting of 24 pigs each, weighing between 40 and 50 kg, were allocated into 3 groups: 1) Eight female pigs; 2) Eight castrated male pigs; 3) Four female and four castrated male pigs (mixed-gender group). Observation was performed by video recording 4 h per day, 1 day per week, for four consecutive weeks. The pigs were weighed once a week during the experiment. The number of TIM events (counts) as well as the identity of the performer and the receiver of TIM behaviour was recorded. The results showed that the frequency of TIM behaviour in the male group was significantly lower than in the female and mixed-gender groups (P=0.003). Size expressed as weight or growth rate did not influence the amount of TIM behaviour performed or received. TIM behaviour was positively related to social exploration and environmental exploration (P<0.001). Finally, TIM behaviour was most often performed while the pigs were standing still or lying down (P<0.001).

The behaviour of the animals was recorded over 24 h on video in the months of September and October. Weight and feed consumption were measured for the 66 females and the 66 male mink placed with the females. The experiment included three cage sizes (0.10, 0.27 and 1.10 m2) and cages with and without nest boxes. In the cages with nest boxes the use of wire netting cylinders and shelves was evaluated. Farm mink, fed ad libitum, had their primary activity period from 04:00 to 10:00 h. There was no food anticipatory activity, but the actual feeding at noon caused an interruption of the animals' resting period. Mink in cages without nest boxes performed more stereotyped behaviour than mink with nest boxes. There was no effect of cage size on the measured behavioural elements. Mink were passive for more than 70% of the day and night and preferred to rest together. Apart from resting in the nest box, mink preferred to rest on shelves above floor level. Lacking the possibility of using a nest box and performance of stereotyped behaviour increase the feed intake of farm mink. A large variation between animals, having a significant effect on all the measured behavioural elements, indicates different coping patterns and/or stress sensitivity.",

Cows were fed encapsulated fat sources (vegetable oil, saturated fat and fish oil). A preperiod diet was fed with no added fat. In a graeco-latin design nine diets comprising three levels of each of the three fat sources were fed. The preperiod diet contained 230 g fatty acids (FA), whereas the three other fats were fed at about 550, 850 and 1150 g FA/day. The feed-ileùm true digestibility of total FA was 95, 47 and 86% for vegetable, saturated and fish fat, respectively. The true digestibility of FA was for all fat sources independent of fat level. The FA digestibility of C16:0 was higher than that of C18:0. The experiment supports the theory that unsaturated FA has a synergistic effect on the digestibility of saturated FA. Bile acid secretion was estimated to be 282–550 g/day, with the lowest secretion for fish fat diets. Secretion was independent of the amount of fat fed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Herbage selenium (Se) concentration is generally low in Norway. It is unknown whether feeding practices on Norwegian organic farms fulfil the dietary needs of Se and vitamin E for sheep and dairy cattle. Therefore we analysed Se in soil and herbage, and Se and vitamin E in animal blood in the indoor feeding season at 14 organic dairy and 14 organic sheep farms. The herbage Se concentration was low. Approximately 50 and 35% of all samples in the first and second cut, respectively, had Se concentrations below the detection limit of 0.01 mg/kg dry matter (DM). The median (10th, 90th percentile) Se concentrations were <0.01 (<0.01, 0.03) and 0.02 (<0.01, 0.06) mg/kg DM in the first and second cuts, respectively. Whole blood Se concentrations were 0.10 (0.04, 0.15) μg/g in dairy cattle and 0.14 (0.03, 0.26) μg/g in sheep. Vitamin E concentrations were 4.2 (2.7, 8.4) mg/l in dairy cattle and 1.3 (0.9, 2.4) mg/l in sheep. None of the soil or plant variables explained the variation in herbage Se concentration, although Se in soil and plant tended to be correlated. Herbage Se concentration was inadequate to meet the dietary Se requirements. Vitamin E requirement was only met in dairy herds. We recommend Se and vitamin E supplementation to ruminants on organic farms.

The main purpose of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters of body condition score (BCS), LEG and ability to move (MOVE) in the blue fox. Heritabilities for BCS, LEG and MOVE were found to be moderate: 0.30, 0.25 and 0.22, respectively. Fast growth rate, high body weight, large gSI and fatness were unfavourably connected to LEG and impaired MOVE in the cage in less than six-month-old blue foxes.

    "abstract": "Abstract The hormone content of a birds’ egg may reflect the environmental conditions of the bird. In this study we measured hormone concentrations of eggs from hens living under different housing conditions. Eggs from 16 floor-housed and 16 singly caged hens were analysed for androstenedione and estradiol. The concentrations of these hormones were highest in the yolk of eggs from floor-housed hens (P≤0.05). The concentration of estradiol in the albumen of eggs was highest for caged birds (P≤0.0001). In caged hens, the concentrations of both hormones varied significantly over days in the egg yolk, but not in the albumen. As the concentration of androstenedione and estradiol in the yolk of chicken eggs is environmentally dependent, these hormones may provide a mechanism by which the hen signals the state of the environment to her progeny.",

Propanol concentrations in samples ranged from not detectable to 9.1 g/kg DM. Propanol concentrations were positively correlated with concentrations of propyl acetate, acetic acid, 2-butanol, propanal, ammonia, and propionate, and negatively correlated with the concentration of l-lactate. At 4 out of 20 farms, the maize silage had ≥5 g propanol/kg DM. The present study indicates that dairy cows in Denmark are commonly exposed to propanol and that approximately 20% of the dairy cows will have an intake in the range of 75–100 g propanol/d under common feeding conditions.",

Content of true whey protein was 36.8% and of casein 52.4%, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that the whey fraction contained 37.1% α-lactalbumin, 29.6% β-lactoglobulin, 16.1% immunoglobulins, 8.1% lactoferrin and 4.7% lysozyme. The content of essential AA in the protein fraction was 48.4%. Results show that composition of mare milk can be influenced by regional differences.",

Silage inclusion level was 20% on an energy basis. From 30 to 110 kg, C and SP pigs had the highest weight gain, while carcasses of SM and SS pigs had higher lean meat content. Based on the consumption of commercial feed, pigs fed silage (SM, SS and SP treatments) had better feed conversion ratio. Although pigs in the silage treatments were fed 20% less commercial feed on an energy basis compared with control pigs, their weight gain was only 5%–15% lower.

In this study, farmers’ decisions were put in the forefront through a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews. The results showed that farmers seemed well aware of biological factors related to cow longevity, that they think the demands on dairy cows have increased over time and that they correlate the higher demands to shorter longevity. However, the farmers had not worked explicitly with longevity of their own herd. There are subjective management decisions behind a culling of a dairy cow, and the reporting of culling reasons does not mirror the farmer’s reasoning behind the decisions, which is a key factor determining longevity.",

Icelandic cattle has very low levels of admixture. We observed very limited population structure in Icelandic cattle. The observed structure was due to variable sire contributions.

The extensive system included 21 loose‐housed animals fed a roughage‐based diet the first winter, allowing a daily gain of 664 g, followed by a 5‐month grazing period. Ten of these animals were slaughtered directly from pasture (live weight ∼360 kg), and the remaining 11 animals after a further 10‐week finishing period with concentrates in tie‐stalls (live weight ∼460 kg). In the intensive system, animals were housed in tie‐stalls, offered concentrates ad libitum and slaughtered at about 360 kg (n = 11) and 460 kg (n = 9) live weight. Overall, daily gain of E‐bulls was 926 g compared with 1478 g for the I‐bulls (p< 0.001). At pasture, E‐bulls gained 1108 g/day. Compared with I‐bulls of similar live weights, the E‐bulls slaughtered directly from pasture had a lower dressing percentage (p < 0.05), a higher lean content (p < 0.05), a much lower fat content (p < 0.05) and darker meat colour (p < 0.05). Finishing‐fed E‐bulls showed no sign of compensatory gain after the grazing period. The finishing period improved the carcass quality of E‐bulls, but the E‐bulls were leaner (p < 0.05) and had a darker meat colour (p < 0.05) than the I‐bulls of similar live weight (460 kg). It is concluded that a finishing period of minimum 10 weeks following the grazing period is necessary to obtain a satisfactory carcass quality of the extensively produced young bulls.",

Bulk tank somatic cell counts (BTSCC) are therefore regularly used to encourage good milk quality through price penalties and to detect mastitis problems in the dairy herd. The use of BTSCC for monitoring is complicated by variation and outliers in the data that may mask the changes that should be detected. The Kalman filter, a recursive algorithm for making short-term predictions, is suggested to reduce the noise in BTSCC data. A multi-process Kalman filter with three components applying to (1) normal variation in the data, (2) outliers and (3) abrupt changes in the level of the data is described with updating equations and an example. Retrospective smoothing of the data is also described. A graphical presentation with the smoothed level of historical BTSCC data and forecasted future BTSCC values, both with confidence intervals, is suggested for monitoring purposes.

Outdoor pigs grew faster when fed ad libitum, but slower during the second phase when restricted, with inferior feed conversion. Most technological meat quality traits (surface and internal reflectance, marbling, pHBF, filter paper wetness, cooking loss and maximal Warner-Bratzler shear force) were similar between rearing systems, whereas pHLD was higher indoors. Total work of Warner-Bratzler shear force was lower in outdoor reared pigs. Maternal sire breed (Duroc or Landrace) and sex (castrate or gilt) did not notably affect meat quality traits. RN genotype had a stronger impact on meat quality than rearing system.

    "abstract": "A small-scale experiment was conducted to examine layers' selection pattern of whole wheat (WW), protein concentrate (PC) and coarse shell meal (SM) throughout the light day. Consumption of all feed components increased prior to darkness. However, an interaction between SM and the other feed components was found (P<0.05), caused by a greater increase in SM consumption prior to darkness than WW and PC. This interaction is probably related to the requirement for calcium for eggshell formation. Energy (WW)/ Protein (PC) consumption ratio did not vary throughout the light day. In a large-scale experiment, a diet with 40% whole wheat incorporated into 3 mm pellets was compared with a complete diet, also as 3 mm pellets, but containing no whole wheat. Coarse shell meal was added in the feed trough for the experimental diet. These diets were examined in conventional 3-hens cages and two furnished cage systems. The hybrids LSL and Shaver 2000 were used. A tendency towards a lower (P=0.07) feed conversion ratio (FCR) was found in the experimental diet relative to the control diet. This may be a result of a better plumage condition for birds fed the experimental diet. Weight of gizzard and gizzard contents was higher among birds on the experimental diet. Self-selection of shell meal did not affect eggshell strength and legbone strength. Birds housed in furnished cages with 16 birds per cage unit showed higher (P<0.05) feed consumption than birds housed in furnished cages with 8 hens per cage and birds housed in conventional 3-hens cages. Egg production was similar in all cage systems, except for a tendency for lower (P=0.06) egg production in the 8-hens cages in the second half of the experiment period. Plumage condition was generally poorer (P<0.05) in the furnished cages than in the conventional 3-hens cages. Fewer comb lesions were found among birds in furnished cages, which may indicate less aggression in layers housed in furnished cages compared with conventional barren 3-hens hen cages.",

    "abstract": "Four cow routing treatments related to fully automatic milking were compared consecutively in one group of 24 Holstein Friesian cows. The objective of the experiment was to investigate how cow traffic towards the automatic milking system (AMS) should be routed and whether a preselection or a waiting area in front of the AMS should be used. The treatments were (1) free routing with selection of cows in the AMS (FREE); (2) free routing with a preselection system in front of the AMS (FREE_SS); (3) free routing with a preselection system and a waiting area in front of the AMS (FREE_WA); and (4) one-way gates resulting in forced routing with preselection and a waiting area in front of the AMS (FORCED_WA). Evaluation of the treatments revealed that FREE may be questionable with regard to the cows' visiting frequency to the AMS and that the use of a waiting area in combination with free routing (FREE_WA) may slow down the passing through the AMS. FORCED_WA may be the best option in relation to the cows' use of the AMS, but this traffic system seems to postpone or even thwart the feeding. The treatment that appears to give the best results is FREE_SS. The type of AMS visit appeared to have a marked influence on the cows' subsequent behaviour. Cows returned to the AMS sooner after non-milking visits and failed attachments (P<0.01). This increases the occupation rate of the AMS and may induce some extra unrest in the herd.",

    "abstract": "An experiment was conducted on three Danish commercial dairy farms using 70 Danish Friesian heifers over a period of 141 to 162 days beginning in November. Average body weight of the heifers was 315 kg at the beginning of the experiment. Fourteen experimental pens were established with a flock size of five and different space allowance in the deep bedding area: 1.8, 2.7, and 3.6 m2 resting area per heifer. The total space allowance inclusive of an unstrawed area at the feed manger was 3.6, 4.5, or 5.5 m2 per heifer in herd 1, 3.6 or 4.5 m2 per heifer in herd 3, and 3.0 or 4.9 m2 per heifer in herd 2. Eating space was standardized within pens to 60 cm per animal. Feed was available ad libitum. At 1.8 m2 resting area per heifer, the heifers were unable to synchronize their resting behaviour, and the variance of the daily lying time was higher compared with heifers at 2.7 or 3.6 m2 resting area. None of the heifers were lying on the unstrawed area. Total lying time was not affected by the space allowance of resting area. There was a tendency towards more aggressive interactions at the lowest resting area of 1.8 m2 per heifer. Frequency of abnormal behaviour was very low and was not affected by the space allowance. Daily gain and feed intake were increased in heifers with a resting area of 2.7 or 3.6 m2 compared with 1.8 m2, but the feed conversion ratio was unaffected. The prevalence of heel horn erosion was higher at 1.8 m2 resting area compared with 2.7 and 3.6 m2. For heifers with access to 2.7 or 3.6 m2 compared with 1.8 m2 resting area per heifer both welfare (behaviour and health) and production were improved.",

To test this the D-loop mitochondrial sequence and nuclear glucosephosphate isomerase processed pseudogene (GPIP) and melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) genes were analysed in 41 Finnish farmed Wild Boar from two farms in order to determine if there was any evidence of hybrid origins. D-loop sequences clustered with European domestic pigs and northern European Wild Boars. On one farm, animals had both European and Asian/European GPIP genotypes suggestive of crossbreeding, while on the other, animals had exclusively European GPIP alleles. One animal from the first farm also had a MC1R genotype, strongly indicative of crossbreeding with European domestic pigs while the other 40 animals showed MC1R genotypes expected for genuine European Wild Boar. Joint consideration of all markers suggests that domestic pigs may have contributed to the origins of the “Wild Boar” on one of the farms.",

Based on difference in body size and digestive anatomy, we expected the lighter short-tailed ewes to browse more on woody plants than the Dala ewes. The experiments were conducted during two consecutive summers within the flocks' usual grazing areas, and we sampled the proportion of grazing time that ewes spent feeding on woody plant species. We tested the hypothesis by applying generalized linear mixed models to the feeding behaviour data. As predicted, the short-tailed ewes spent substantially more of their grazing time browsing on trees, bushes and heather compared to the Dala ewes. We discuss the results in the context of maintaining the, now threatened, pastoral landscapes of mountainous regions of Norway; short-tailed breeds should be more effective than the Dala breed in reducing tree and bush encroachment, but more detailed studies are needed to quantify the breed differences in this respect.",

A total of 450 broilers of three different strains (I 657, Light Sussex, New Hampshire) were reared in an organic research orchard. Half of each strain was slaughtered at 91 days and the other half at 120 days. All broilers were weighed and a clinical welfare assessment was made at slaughter. A trained sensory panel evaluated the breast meat in relation to flavour, smell and texture characteristics defined by the panel. At both 91 and 120 days of age the commercial breed I 657 was significantly heavier than the slower growing strains. Males were significantly heavier than the females across strains. Weight ratios between males and females were nearly the same at both slaughter ages in I 657, whereas weight ratios increased significantly at 120 days in Light Sussex and New Hampshire. No overall effect of strain was found on the flavour and smell of the breast meat. However, the age-related changes in tenderness and toughness differed significantly between strains, since the commercial strain tended towards a tougher and less tender consistency with age, whereas the opposite was the case for the slower growing pure breeds. The positive flavour of salt was significantly improved at 120 days across strains with females having a saltier flavour than the males with age. The positive flavour of sweet corn was improved in the meat from the males, whereas the positive smell of sweet corn was significantly improved in both males and females. No negative effects of age were found. In conclusion, broilers were tastier when slaughtered at 120 days compared with 91 days. The development in meat tenderness was related to strain, and weights at slaughter were related to both strain and sex.",

The experiment included three treatments with 12 eight-week-old barrows with an average initial body weight (BW) of 8.5 kg. The piglets were fitted with a simple T cannula at the distal ileum. They were fed a basal diet (control, CON) based on wheat, barley and soybean meal alone or either supplemented with betaine monohydrate (betaine treatment, BET) or condensed molasses solubles (condensed molasses solubles treatment, CMS). Each treatment included four piglets in two repeated measurements. Titanium dioxide was added as a digestibility marker. The collection of faeces began at 20.00 h on day 7 and continued for 48 consecutive hours. Ileal digesta were collected for 24 h from 20.00 to 08.00 h on day 9 and 10 and from 08.00 to 20.00 h on day 11. The second collection period started on day 14 following the same procedure. The ileal and total tract digestibilities of NDF, ADF and crude ash were improved (p<0.05) due to supplemental BET and CMS. The supplementation of CMS increased (p<0.05) the ileal digestibilities of and most amino acids by 2 to 8 percentage units whereas BET supplementation resulted in a decrease (p<0.05) in the ileal digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids by 2 to 7 percentage units. It can be concluded that, in piglets, betaine originating from different sources promotes efficiently the fermentation of dietary NDF and ADF in association with improved mineral absorption, whereas the effects on ileal amino acid digestibility are equivocal.",

We present here a study of the genetic variation of these breeds at a nuclear level from the analysis of 30 microsatellite loci. Parameters of variability indicated a high level of variation in the breeds analysed. Mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 7.8 to 10.4 and gene diversity varied between 0.69 and 0.74. Considerable differences were detected between breeds regarding the pattern of within-breed variability. Breed-specific alleles were detected at most loci and all breeds analysed, a total of 75 private variants being identified. The Hemsin sheep showed noticeably lower genetic variation in accordance with the present status of this breed. Percentages of shared alleles (from 54.8% to 69.5%) and gene flow estimates (from 5.98 to 28.32) gave information about the relative genetic differentiation of breeds. The results presented here for nuclear DNA complement those reported for mtDNA and bear out the need to preserve this invaluable genetic material.

In total, 13 lactations on concrete and 11 on polyurethane were evaluated. The severity of skin lesions was scored and teat and claw lesions were recorded. The sand-filled coating was rougher compared to the concrete floor. Larger litter sizes were associated with a higher proportion of wounded teats in sows. Only seven of the 230 piglets had no skin lesions. The piglet skin lesions generally healed, since the number of more severe lesions decreased (p<0.001) and the number of less severe lesions (p<0.001) increased over time. Piglet lesions were associated with daily weight gain and litter size. The number of skin lesions on sows and piglets did not differ between animals kept on concrete and polyurethane-covered flooring. However, piglets kept on the latter flooring had more frequent claw lesions. On both types of flooring the majority of the piglets had skin lesions. Piglets had more claw lesions on polyurethane coating due to its roughness. In addition to the possibility of lower weight gains in piglets due to severe lesions, pig skin lesions are themselves a severe welfare problem in this type of housing system.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present paper was to study the throughput capacity (i.e. the ability of straw to drain through slatted flooring) of 15 kg of chopped straw used around the time of farrowing. A cohort study including 96 sows was conducted in two commercial herds, comparing chopped wheat straw of three length categories (mass median length 39, 70 and 130 mm). Straw with short and medium chop lengths was completely absent in 83% (plastic slats) and 85% (cast-iron slats), respectively, of the pens on Day 4 after farrowing, compared to 7% and 6% of pens provided with the longest straw category. We conclude that it is technically feasible to have an efficient throughput of straw and to maintain good pen hygiene in partly slatted farrowing pens provided with 15 kg of chopped straw at farrowing. However, straw chop lengths need to be adjusted to the type of slatted flooring used.

However, production of meat originating from dairy herds has been shown to be economically more profitable and to produce less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of product than beef production from suckler cow systems. Therefore, when safeguarding beef self-sufficiency, the intensification of beef production from dairy herds is a more promising option to consider. In this study, the possibility of different options for increasing dairy beef production was assessed by using a deterministic simulation. Increasing the use of crossbreeding in dairy herds, especially when combined with the use of Y-sorted semen, appeared to be the most efficient strategy for increasing dairy beef production. The decrease in the replacement rate increased beef production through the potential for enhancing crossbreeding.",

Samples of pasture grass, herbs, willow shrub leaves and bilberry (N = 575) from 142 locations were analysed for Cu, Mo, S and Fe. A large geographical variation was observed for Mo concentration and Cu:Mo ratio, a somewhat smaller variation for Fe, while Cu and S concentrations showed limited geographical variation. The Mo variation led to a Cu:Mo ratio <2 in 2% of the samples and >20 in 62% of samples, confirming that the trace element composition of Norwegian sheep pastures may represent a risk of Cu deficiency as well as Cu overload, depending on location. A considerable botanical variation was also observed, in particular for Cu and Mo.Keywords: Natural pasturestrace elementsCu:Mo ratiospatial distribution AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to all the participating sheep farmers for their collection of pasture plants, and to the Norwegian sheep and goat association for their active support and promotion of the project.

Increasing slaughter weight, suboptimal chilling regime, effects of post-slaughter pH and temperature on glycolysis, and protein denaturation seem to be important factors connected to water-holding and colour attributes. The presence and expression of the n allele on the RYR1 gene and the RN – allele on the PRKAG3 gene increase PSE incidence. Studies involving tissue characterization of destructured muscles have associated oxidative stress and apoptotic processes with the progression of 'PSE-like zones'. Classical PSE meat shows many histological and biological similarities with PSE-like zones, particularly in protein characteristics, but there are differences in underlying physiological mechanisms limiting PSE-like zones to deep semimembranosus muscles. Developing early detection methods, efficient carcass handling, mapping underlying physiological mechanisms, and determining genetic background are important future measures to eliminate PSE-like zones and improve pork quality.",

There were no significant differences in aggression, body lesions or production results between herds with concrete floor and herds with straw bedding.

Sixteen creep fed litters were divided at weaning (5 weeks of ages); half the litter was fed ad lib (FF), while the other half was fed restricted (RF) from day 3 to day 8 after weaning (restrictive period: 50% reduction on day 3, another 50% reduction on day 4, minimum ration 100 g pig−1 day−1, the same amount on days 5 and 6, double the amount on days 7 and 8, and then ad lib). Food intake (per pen), weight and diarrhoea (individually) were registered daily for 14 days post weaning. Studies of faecal haemolytic E. coli (days 4, 5, 6, 8 and 14), blood plama levels of total cortisol and immunoreactive cationic trypsin (IRCT) (days 2, 6, 9 and 14) and body temperature (days 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8) were done on two pigs per pen. During the restrictive period the RF pigs had significantly lower diarrhoea score, fewer number of antibiotic treatments and a lower proportion of faecal haemolytic E. coli than the FF pigs; however, the restrictive feeding also resulted in a significantly lower weight gain than for the FF pigs. Before and after feed restriction no differences were found between treatements (no peak in post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) or haemolytic E. coli among the RF pigs when ad lib feeding was resumed). No significant differences in blood plasma levels of IRCT or total cortisol were observed between the treatments. The performance of the FF pigs was also relatively poor during the restrictive period as compared with the period after, which may partly be due to a peak in PWD and haemoyltic E. coli. Thus a strategic feed restriction during days 3-8 post weaning appeared to reduce the proliferation of haemolytic E. coli and the occurrence of PWD for 14 days post weaning.",

The largest deviations between ruminal digestibility and ED were found with medium to high contents of starch in the rations owing to a more profound depression of NDF degradation in nylon bags compared to in vivo. This was caused most probably by an underestimation of rate of degradation and an overestimation of lag time in the nylon bags.",

This clearly represents a preselection process which may affect the ability to estimate the true genetic trend on the basis of mixed linear model methods. This problem was conceptually examined by stochastic simulation and the animal model by assuming positive genetic and environmental correlations between a preselection criterion and transformed earnings. Inclusion of data on started horses, only, in the analysis (a selected data approach) resulted in a severe underestimation of the true genetic trend, while addition of zero unrankable earnings for horses culled prior to races (a dummy data approach) reduced the bias from preselection. The dummy data approach appeared robust to changes in preselection intensity over time, but sensitive to increasing phenotypic variance in transformed earnings due to inflation. The latter problem was taken into account by expressing the phenotypes as standard normal deviates within birth year. Key Words: animal modelinflated varianceMonte-Carlo simulationselected data",

This effect was two-fold higher when pigs were fed the high level compared to the normal level of dietary protein (16 vs. 7%). Histochemical analysis of slow-twitch (ST) and fast-twitch fibres (FTa and FTb) of biopsy samples taken either in vivo by a biopsy needle or post mortem from M. longissimus dorsi (LD) and M. biceps femoris (BF) demonstrated an increase in the relative area of the muscles occupied by FTb fibres. This was mainly due to a reduced frequency of the smaller FTa fibres and an increased frequency of the larger FTb fibres, which indicates an FTa to FTb fibre type conversion induced by salbutamol. In BF, a reduction in the frequency of and the relative area occupied by ST fibres was also found. The changes had already occured at 45 kg body weight in the LD muscle. The extent of vascularization of the muscles was not influenced by salbutamol. The level of dietary protein did not affect muscle fibre properties, nor did it interact with salbutamol. The mechanism(s) by which salbutamol induces these related changes in protein metabolism and fibre type distribution is (are) complex, and may involve direct β-adrenergic receptor stimulation as well as interactions with other anabolic or catabolic hormones.

Pigs with observed live weight higher than a threshold weight are delivered for slaughter. The pen is emptied depending on the age and number of remaining pigs in the pen. The optimal delivery policy is relatively robust to variations in weighing precision. The value of high weighing precision decreases markedly with increasing number of pigs per pen and is generally low. With 16 pigs per pen the low value of improved weighing precision leaves little financial room for investment in weighing equipment.",

Several welfare issues may arise in tie-stall housing systems. We describe the situation in 47 farms in three villages in western Italy, trying to identify possible relationships among structural and management characteristics, animal health and behaviour traits. A long duration of the grazing period, associated with frequent manure removal during the housing period, are probably key factors for limiting the occurrence of lameness. Teat trauma is more common in narrower stalls. Getting-up behaviour is unnatural in most of the visited farms. Some lack in the farmers' knowledge of animal behaviour was noted. Some structural and management characteristics are strictly related to geographical constraints. However, circumstances permitting, some expedients may be achieved for improving welfare levels.

    "abstract": "Abstract We investigated whether feeding cows are disturbed by butting of other cows during the time they are in a concentrate self-feeder, and whether this leads to concentrate leftovers. Forty dairy cows were observed while visiting two self-feeders. If a cow was butted visiting the self-feeder, it was considered as 'disturbed visit'. When retreating from the feeder within five seconds after being butted, the visit was also considered 'interrupted'. Half of the visits were disturbed, and 42% of visits were also interrupted. Visits were disturbed particularly when cows' own feed was dispensed, and in 63% of disturbed visits concentrates were left over. The non-lactating cows, denied concentrates, won leftover concentrates after butting the previous visitor more often than lactating cows. Cows' weight correlated negatively with visiting and receiving butting. Initiated butting correlated positively with winning leftover concentrates. There is a need for further development of automatic feeders to secure individual concentrate feeding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Outdoor production on pasture is considered an option in organic pig production. The aim of the present trial was to study the influence of feeding strategies combining outdoor and indoor rearing on pig meat quality. The experiment was carried out with 245 pigs in 5 replicates, and commenced following weaning at day 52. Five treatments were compared: 1) pigs fed ad libitum and reared indoors with access to an outdoor concrete area (In-A); 2) pigs fed restrictively on pasture until 40 kg body weight and then kept indoors with access to an outdoor concrete area and fed ad libitum until slaughter (In-40A); 3) pigs fed restrictively on pasture until 80 kg body weight and then kept indoors with access to an outdoor concrete area and fed ad libitum until slaughter (In-80A); 4) pigs reared on pasture and fed restrictively during the whole period of growth (Out-R); and 5) pigs reared on pasture and fed ad libitum during the whole period of growth (Out-A). All pigs had free access to roughage (clover-grass silage/fresh clover grass). Restrictive feeding in the weight range from weaning to 40 kg body weight (In-40A) resulted in a reduced daily gain; however, following transfer to indoor facilities and ad libitum feeding these pigs compensated in growth and the overall daily gain did not differ from the In-A control pigs. Pigs fed restrictively from weaning to 80 kg body weight were unable to compensate completely following transfer to indoor facilities. Out-R pigs had the lowest overall daily gain, while In-A pigs and Out-A pigs had similar daily gain. Meat quality assessments were performed on longissimus dorsi (LD) samples from a subsample of 100 pigs (2 castrates and 2 female pigs from each treatment in each replicate). Compared to meat from either ad libitum treatments (In-A and Out-A), meat from Out-R and In-80A pigs was less red due to a lower pigmentation, and had a higher ratio of polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acids. In addition, Out-R female pigs had numerically (6–10 Newton) higher shear force than In-A and Out-A. Treatments did not affect the concentration of α-tocopherol of meat. Introducing a finishing period with free access to concentrates following 40 kg body weight until slaughter prevented the deterioration in meat quality. However, a finishing period following 80 kg body weight was not sufficient. In conclusion, ad libitum feeding in the organic production system gave superior meat quality compared to a restrictive feeding strategy. However, including a finishing period indoors with ad libitum feeding of concentrates may prevent the detrimental effect of restrictive feeding on meat quality.

Furthermore, the suitability of two breed crosses for outdoor rearing was studied. The effects on performance, carcass and technological quality traits were investigated. During two years, 240 pigs of Duroc x Large White (D*LW) and Swedish Landrace x Large White (L*LW) were allocated to three production systems: 1) Pigs kept outdoors, fed an organic diluted diet (20% alfalfa roughage) ad libitum; 2) Pigs kept outdoors, strategically fed a diluted organic diet up to a live weight of approximately 80 kg and thereafter an undiluted organic diet ad libitum; 3) Pigs kept indoors, fed an undiluted organic diet restrictively. For outdoor pigs, strategic feeding increased daily weight gain and backfat thickness, compared with feeding a diluted diet throughout (p≤0.01). L*LW pigs in both outdoor systems grew slower than in the indoor system (p≤0.001), whereas for D*LW pigs only outdoor pigs fed the diluted diet had a slower growth rate. Outdoor pigs had lower dressing percentage than indoor pigs. Glycogen content and L* values in M. longissimus dorsi were higher, whereas b* values were lower in meat from pigs in the indoor system. D*LW pigs had higher water-holding capacity (lower drip, thawing and cooking losses), lower shear force and higher intramuscular fat content compared with L*LW pigs.",

Individually fed broilers were fed by one of four different diets with different levels of selenium; from 37 µg to 185 µg selenium kg–1, for 21 days. The selenium concentration in thigh muscle, liver and excreta, and the activity of glutathione peroxidase increased with increasing selenium intake. Broiler weight and feed efficiency ratio was not affected by selenium intake. Diets based on selenium-fertilized wheat or wheat combined with selenium-enriched yeast lead to increased selenium concentration in liver and muscle of broilers. The selenium concentration was three times higher in liver than in muscle; chicken liver may therefore be a good source for selenium.",

In this study, 40 cattle for each of SAR and EAR were used. OPN in intron 4, PRL in exon 3 and PIT-1 in exon 6 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the resulting PCR products were subjected to digestion using BseNI, RsaI and HinfI enzymes, respectively, to determine the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results showed that frequencies of the OPN allele C, PRL allele B, and PIT-1 allele A which are associated with milk production tarits were found low in SAR and EAR. As a result, SAR and EAR cattle breeds have the lower allel frequencies that influence the milk production traits for three genes than high-yielding European dairy cattle breeds.

Random-regression BLUP (RR-BLUP) and Bayesian inference (Bayes-B) were compared with BLUP based on trait phenotypes and pedigree (TP-BLUP), where the genomic information consisted of genotypes at 110 or 2010 unlinked SNP loci. Of these loci, 10 were the actual trait loci. Accuracies for RR-BLUP were much higher than for TP-BLUP with 110 loci, but they were closer to TP-BLUP with 2010 loci. Accuracies with Bayes-B were close to 1 with 110 or with 2010 loci. Results for Bayes-B were also examined with a range of 3000 to 60 000 markers in linkage disequilibrium on 30 chromosomes. Increasing the number of markers did not lower the accuracy of Bayes-B. Thus, Bayes-B seems to be well suited for whole-genome analyses with large numbers of loci. This may not be the case for RR-BLUP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Only fast-growing broilers are available for organic production in Sweden, and due to organic legislations and long rearing periods feed restriction has to be practised. To evaluate the effect on welfare aspects and health, two diets, low in crude protein content, with (LPA) and without amino acid supplements (LP) were fed to 1400 Ross 308 chickens, divided over eight pens in two chicken houses, with access to outdoor pasture. Behavioural observations were conducted at 2, 6 and 10 weeks. In general, birds fed the LP diet used their outdoor pasture more, and showed a higher frequency of behaviours related to feed search, than the LPA birds. The LPA diet resulted in higher live weight, mortality and more leg problems. However, cannibalism outbreaks which are rarely seen in broiler production occurred in the LP birds. This indicates that new problems were introduced that are not beneficial for animal welfare. Furthermore, the behaviour differences related to feed search, changes between behaviours and preening might have indicated a frustration related to the qualitative feed restriction for the chickens given the LP diet.

BW on the first test-day after calving correlated negatively (r=−0.30; P<0.02) with EB, suggesting large loss of body reserves for heavier cows. FP correlated significantly (r=−0.37) with EB on the first but not on the other test-days. Thus, when a single measure of FP is used to predict EB, records on the first test-day after calving seem to be the most appropriate. Milk FP was a better predictor of EB than BCS, BW or their changes. The accuracies of predictions were moderate; the best prediction explained 39.4% of EB variation.

These are usually combined with gonadotropins. Research on these hormones indicates that CIDR, MAP, and FGA can be regarded as equally effective for induction of estrus in ewes. Prostaglandins are a suitable alternative for estrous synchronization especially considering that progestogens may have negative effects on the functionality of ovulatory follicles. Artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and the acceleration of herd genetic trait improvement are among the potential practical applications of synchronous estrus in ewes.",

A logistic regression model was used to estimate associations between herd type and herd-related factors. Large herds and herds increasing in size by more than 50% were less likely to have long PL. High average milk yield was not a risk factor for short PL, but herds with the lowest yield were more likely to be long PL herds. These herds had lower estimated breeding values for milk, most likely due to a slower herd turnover rate. A high proportion of cows culled early in first lactation had a large effect on the probability of being a short PL herd.",

A breed-specific survey was established to characterize farmers’ preferences for improvements in 10 traits, by means of pairwise rankings using the online software 1000Minds. These pairwise rankings were based on equal economic worth of trait improvements. The DR survey was filled in by 87 farmers and the DJ survey by 76 farmers. Both DR and DJ farmers gave the highest preference to improvements in mastitis, and the lowest to calving difficulty. By means of a cluster analysis, three distinct clusters of farmers were identified per breed. Comparisons of herd characteristics between clusters suggest that farmers choose to improve traits that are problematic in their herds. This study shows that heterogeneity exists in farmers’ preferences for trait improvements and that herd characteristics influence these preferences in DR and DJ.",

While these chickens are reported to grow at rates better suited to organic production than previously available strains, anecdotal evidence suggested increased fearfulness in this strain and concerns were raised that this may deter the birds from accessing the range. We subjected Rowan Rangers and fast-growing Ross 308 raised on the same organic farm to a set of behavioural tests while also tracking activity and outdoor use. The results suggest that although Rowan Rangers indeed show longer durations of tonic immobility, an index of predator-related fear, both strains made an outdoor visit on average once every 1.5 h and typically spent around 5% of their days in the range. Overall however, our results support the transition to Rowan Rangers in organic chicken production in Sweden.",

This was remarkable as this variant is only found in a very low frequency in the major Danish breeds. Novel associations were found between β-CN variant F and milk coagulation properties in the native breeds, which is an important finding for understanding the genetic background for non- and poor coagulating milk and potential exploitation of β-CN variants in selective breeding programs.

The present analysis was based on experimental data for high-yielding dairy cows showing that feeding concentrate based on byproducts gives similar milk yield as feeding concentrate based on cereal grains and soybean meal. Evaluation of the different concentrates using life cycle assessment showed that using byproducts required less cropland (−35%), reduced carbon footprint (−20%) and lowered eutrophication potential (−20%) compared with the control. Energy use was higher (+30%), due to the need for drying wet byproducts.

Eating spaces were standardized to about 50 cm per animal. Ad libitum feeding was practised and rations contained a maximum 30% concentrates (dry matter). An increase in space allowance from 1.5 to 3.0 m2 per animal in pens with fully slatted floors increased the live weight gain by 174 g day−1 or 31% (P = .04) and net energy intake per kg live weight gain was reduced by 23% (P = .04). Heifers housed in small pens lay down less than heifers in large pens. Access to bedding affected number of lying periods. Production, however, was not influenced by access to a bedded lying area. Flock size is of minor importance for heifers' production, when fed ad libitum and one eating space per animal is ensured. The prevalence of heel horn erosion was reduced and claw length was increased in heifers with access to bedding. No occurrence of tail tip necrosis regardless of pen type was found.

Four hundred growing pigs were included in the experiment. The grinding of the cereal was performed on a hammer-mill, mounted with a 3-mm screen or rolled on a roller mill. Performance was only slightly influenced by the disintegration method and the use of straw as bedding material. Ad libitum fed pigs, however, had a 5.5% higher (P<0.001) daily weight gain and a 0.6 percentage unit lower (P<0.01) lean meat percentage compared to pigs fed twice daily. Feed with rolled cereals increased (P<0.001) the empty stomach weight by 13%, but only in pigs not receiving straw bedding. Ad libitum feeding reduced (P<0.001) the empty stomach weight and volume by 15% and 37%, respectively. Feed with rolled cereals increased (P<0.001) the dry matter content of the stomach by 23%. The general level of gastric lesions in the pars oesophagea was low in this experiment, which most likely was due to the high content of barley in the feed mixture. The pigs receiving straw bedding, but also the pigs receiving rolled cereals but no straw bedding, had nearly no gastric lesions (average score=0.1), contrary to the pigs receiving ground feed but no straw bedding (average score=1.0). This interaction in gastric lesions between disintegration method and straw as bedding material indicates that feeding rolled cereals has similar preventive effects on gastric lesions as straw eaten.",

Fur damage in the neck, however, only appeared when the animals were placed two or more together, so it can be deduced that the appearance of neck damage is not self‐inflicted. It may appear as a result of normal behaviour of mink in connection with mating and aggressive interactions and also as an abnormal behaviour probably caused by understimulation. Fur damage on the tail increased when mink were separated or when females lost their kits at weaning. Tail damage is caused by an abnormal behaviour (fur chewing) that is self‐inflicted, where frustration and understimulation can be involved. It seems possible that the threshold value for the occurrence of fur chewing could be changed through selection. Key words: behaviourminkpelt bitingpelt chewingwelfare",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three rumen fistulated and catheterized sheep were meal-fed and used to study ruminal and arterial concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) as well as portal appearance rates of SCFA and irreversible loss rate (ILR) of acetate in 24 h periods on a hay and a concentrate/straw diet, respectively. Ruminal and arterial concentrations as well as portal appearance rates of SCFA and ILR of acetate were significantly affected by the intake of feed. Generally, the highest concentrations and appearance rates were obtained 2 h after feeding. The portal recovery of arterial acetate was not affected by feeding or diet. The 24 h means were 0.68 ± 0.01 and 0.67 ± 0.01 on the hay and the concentrate/straw diet, respectively. Partial correlation coefficients corrected for the effects of time, sheep, and diet were calculated for the relationships evaluated. The portal appearance rate of acetate (r = 0.52, P <0.001) and the portal net appearance rate of propionate (r = 0.68, P <0.001) were linearly related to the ruminal concentrations of the two SCFA. The logarithm of the portal net appearance rate of butyrate seemed to be linearly related to the logarithm of the ruminal concentration of undissociated butyric acid (r = 0.70, P <0.001) when the effect of time was omitted from the model. The portal appearance rate of acetate (r = 0.22, P <0.05) and the portal net appearance rate of propionate (r = 0.63, P <0.001) as well as butyrate (r = 0.55, P <0.001) were linearly related to the arterial concentration of the respective SCFA. The results show that within animal and diet the ruminal as well as arterial concentrations are good predictors of SCFA portal appearance rates in sheep fed roughage at maintenance. Ruminal and arterial concentrations of SCFA seem less reliable predictors of portal appearance rates of SCFA between diets and sheep. The portal appearance of SCFA, 5.6 ± 0.5 and 7.0 ± 0.3 mol d−1, accounted for 44 ± 4 and 43 ± 2% of the calculated metabolizable energy intake on the hay and the concentrate/straw diets, respectively.",

We chose the pregnant sow as a 'case' to develop the assessment method. First, we designed and tested a very simple prototype DSS in order to examine several basic ideas as to how welfare can be assessed on a scientific basis. In this prototype welfare assessment was based on the needs of animals. The second version of the DSS, which extended the approach taken in the first, included a wider range of housing systems and an improved knowledge base. It used a rigid formal procedure to construct the model, moving directly from scientific statements into if-then rules. However, this extended version resulted in counter-intuitive scores for the seven main housing systems for pregnant sows. In the third version of the DSS the complexity of the model was reduced, if-then rules being excluded. It was based on more general biological considerations (needs and sub-needs) and produced scores which accorded better with expert opinion. Weighting was managed in a simplified, but procedural way. For improved welfare assessment we suggest that the method of 'reflective equilibrium' should be used.",

This was followed by a large decline on the day of farrowing, when the lowest mean values of 1.07 mg, 0.15 mg and 2879 U per litre (l) of blood plasma, respectively, were recorded. During lactation the concentrations of vitamin E, GSH-Px and retinol in blood plasma of the sows increased to levels observed during late gestation. The highest mean concentrations of vitamin E (17.9 mg kg- 1 ), selenium (200 w g l- 1 ) and retinol (2.45 mg kg- 1 ) were found in colostrum, but with a large variation between sows. One week postpartum the concentrations of vitamin E, selenium and retinol in sow milk had decreased, on average by 86, 68 and 71%, respectively, after which only small changes occurred. Mean concentrations of vitamin E (1.77 mg l- 1 ), GSH-Px (682 U l- 1 ) and retinol (0.07 mg l- 1 ) were low in the blood plasma of the piglets at birth, but a large increase was observed on the next sampling occasion at the age of 3 days (vitamin E: 5.31 mg l- 1 ; GSH-Px: 996 U l- 1 ; retinol: 0.19 mg l- 1 ). The mean concentration of vitamin E in blood plasma of the piglets declined thereafter until the age of 6 weeks (1.04 mg l- 1 ), when there was a small increase, while the mean concentrations of GSH-Px and retinol continued to increase during the suckling period. A high correlation was found between the concentration of vitamin E in blood plasma and sidefat thickness of the sows (r = 0.94), and between the concentration of vitamin E in colostrum and vitamin E in blood plasma of the sows on the day of farrowing (r =0.77). High correlations were also found between the concentration of vitamin E in the blood plasma of the piglets at 3 days and 5 weeks of age and the concentration of vitamin E in colostrum (r = 0.78) and (r =0.89), respectively. The results indicate that vitamin E storage in the adipose tissues of the sow has a great influence on the supply of vitamin E via colostrum and milk to the piglet.

The observed genetic variation of the population is influenced by the biology and circumstances of the individuals through which it passes, including migration, population size and selection. Therefore, selection of appropriate genetic analysis is vital to the success of diversity studies. Neutral and non-neutral genetic markers are both used to characterize breeds for conservation purposes; selection depends on the availability, applicability and objectives of the study, as markers are highly variable in their information content. The application of DNA based markers in diversity studies is valuable for filling gaps in documentation and confirming its accuracy. However, selection of breeds for conservation should also consider more criteria including degree of endangerment, traits of economic or scientific importance, ecological, historical and cultural values.",

The two breeds included in the study were the high yielding, modern dairy cattle breed Norwegian Red (NR) and the moderate yielding, old dairy cattle breed Blacksided Tr⊘nder and Nordland Cattle (STN). Grazing behaviour included general activities such as walking, standing, lying and playing, and grazing activities such as grazing, drinking and ruminating. During the daily grazing period the cows’ grazing behaviour were recorded at fixed intervals of 10 or 15 min. Breed differences were found in three of the recorded traits. The NR cows showed a higher frequency of ‘standing’ than the STN cows (p<0.01), and the STN cows showed higher frequencies of ‘walking’ (p<0.05) and ‘playing’ (p<0.01) than the NR cows. The time spent on grazing showed no difference between the breeds. The number of observations in the present study was somewhat limited as these types of studies are very resource demanding. Longer recording periods, more animals and farms would have been preferable. However, the breed differences expressed are in line with the expectations with regard to playing, standing and walking, while grazing activity did not follow the hypothesis made.",

Sixty-four pigs (two castrated males and two females per pen) weighing 34.34±5.22 kg were assigned to four dietary treatments. During grower (35–55 kg), pigs were fed isoenergetic lysine-restricted diets. The different lysine content of diets were 0.950 (NRC recommendation), 0.760, 0.665 and 0.570%, corresponding to lysine restriction of 20, 30 and 40%. Then all pigs were fed with common finisher 1 (55–85 kg) and 2 (85–115 kg) diets. Lysine restriction during the grower phase resulted in poor performance and lower concentration of blood metabolites but improved the nutrient digestibility and efficiency of lysine utilization. Compensatory growth response in terms of improved weight gain and feed efficiency was observed in pigs previously fed lysine-restricted diets during finisher 1, but the concentration of blood urea nitrogen and total protein were lower. No differences in growth performance, digestibility of nutrients and blood metabolites were noted during finisher 2. Lysine restriction of grower diets decreased the dressing percentage (quadratic, P=0.024), and protein content of longissimus muscle (linear P=0.034, and quadratic P=0.009). Thus, it could be concluded that pigs subjected to lysine restriction during grower phase exhibited compensatory growth responses in weight gain and improved efficiency of feed and lysine utilization for weight gain and lean accretion during finisher phase.

All animals were also offered grass silage and hay. The commercial concentrate contained more crude protein than barley grain (135 g/kg DM vs. 205 g/kg DM). The data were analysed using analysis of variance and differences between the treatments were tested by orthogonal contrasts: LC vs. MC and LB vs. LC. The growth of the heifers increased and carcass conformation improved with increasing concentrate level. Commercial concentrate did not improve animal performance compared with barley grain.

The time budgets and diurnal rhythms of the UB and PAD bulls were quite similar.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Icelandic cattle breed is believed to have been brought to Iceland from Norway around 1100 years ago. Since then it is thought to have been almost completely isolated and to have gone through large fluctuations in population size. Here molecular markers were used to assess the breed's genetic diversity and the current within-population genetic structure using a randomly selected unbiased sample from the population as verified by calculations of the coefficient of relationship (R). Measures of genetic diversity suggest that there is considerable diversity within the breed despite long-term isolation and the effective population size is high considering the isolation and the breeding system used in recent years. No evidence of recent bottlenecks was found and analysis of population structure suggests that the population is uniform in structure.",

The calves fed more AFM had lower solid feed intake, higher energy intake and higher gain during pre-weaning period as compared to calves fed less AFM/MR. The calves fed MR had a poorer lifetime gain than those in the other feeding groups. There were no differences in the lifetime gain or slaughter parameters among treatments fed AFM.",

Nienty three unrelated individuals belonging to three local sheep breeds were analyzed for 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Results were used to assess population parameters. This study was carried out within the framework of ECONOGENE project, intended to help molecular characterization of Albanian local sheep breeds. Population structure analysis and the assignment of individuals to their reference population were carried out. Almost all of the genetic variations were due to differences between individuals. Mean percentage of individuals was correctly assigned using the Bayesian approach at 45.16%. Factorial component analysis and model-based clustering did not differentiate sheep breeds but displayed a high level of breed admixture. These statements were in concordance with small genetic distance between breeds. We were able to identify individuals purely corresponding to their reference population, who might be used in the breeding programs in the near future, for conserving these valuable breeds.",

In spite of an increased concentration of these vitamins in the serum of piglets, no clear effect on the rearing results was found. However, an advantageous post-effect of the vitamins fed to sows was shown. The addition of vitamin E together with vitamin C significantly reduced the body temperature of sows after farrowing and considerably reduced the number of sows culled after rearing.

The remaining three groups were differentiated by adding 0.2 mg kg−1 Se-enriched yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and/or 60 mg vitamin E to feed (grower and finisher). Our results show that the addition of organic Se to inorganic Se commonly used in pig feed caused a significant increase in hepatic Se and muscle. This indicates the possibility of using these products as functional foods to improve Se status in humans residing within regions which are deficient in this trace element.

Reciprocal crosses of Fayoumi and Sasso performed better than the remaining seven genotypes, with Koekoek and reciprocals of Fayoumi and Koekoek showing intermediate performance, but Fayoumi and White Leghorn and reciprocals involving them performed the least.

A range of haematological and hormonal parameters have been shown to be good indicators of stress. However, blood sampling, which entails the presence of humans and handling of the animals, can itself be a stressor that influences the results of an experiment. The present study shows that a group of silver foxes (n = 7) that had been regularly blood sampled (RBS-group) for a year had higher plasma concentrations of cortisol and lower concentrations of testosterone compared with an earlier non-blood-sampled group (NBS-group) (n = 7). The RBS-group also tended to have a lower number of lymphocytes. In addition, during a series of five blood samples taken at 30 min intervals, both groups showed an increase in plasma concentrations of cortisol, whereas numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophil leucocytes decreased. Plasma testosterone concentrations decreased after an initial increase. The study demonstrated that blood sampling, in both the long and short term, can profoundly affect hormone concentrations and leucocyte numbers.",

Both groups of pigs were kept at a high stocking rate (0.6 m2 per pig) and high temperatures (≥25[ddot]C). This study also aimed to show if changing the treatment a week prior to slaughter is sufficient to change the concentration of indole and skatole in subcutaneous fat. The experimental material consisted of 158 LY (Danish Land-race x Large White) zigzag crossbred and LYD (Danish Land-race x Large White x Duroc) crossbred entire male, castrate, and female pigs. With the exception of the first delivery, where half of the pigs were kept constantly clean and the other half constantly dirty from the start of the experiment, both treatments were changed to the opposite treatment one week before delivery to the abattoir. Post-slaughter the content of indole and skatole in subcutaneous backfat was determined using an HPLC method and the content of skatole equivalents was determined using an automatic spectrophotometric method. The experiment confirmed the hypothesis that heavily fouled pigs at a high stocking rate had higher indole and skatole levels in subcutaneous fat than pigs kept clean on a wholly slatted floor. It was possible within one week to increase or lower the indole and skatole levels depending on the treatment during the last week before slaughter. The experiment showed similar differences in all three sexes. The variation in skatole content between sires was highly significant, which supports the skatole level in subcutaneous fat having a genetic component.",

Measurements were taken in early lactation, at high feeding level (19.7 kg DM day−1), and repeated at late lactation (10 kg DM day−1) with the same animals and diets. The SAB contained more AA than LAB (P < 0.05), and differences in AA profiles between LAB and SAB were observed for 9 out of 17 AA studied. Feeding level affected only four AA. Increased levels of DIP in the concentrate mixtures increased the content of AA in the bacteria (P < 0.05). Addition of formaldehyde to the ruminai samples prior to bacterial isolation reduced the total AA content by 11%, on average.

    "abstract": "Discriminant analysis was used to identify combinations of variables, characterizing patterns of jaw movement (JM) during eating and rumination, that minimize errors when classifying series of successive JM of known behaviour into rumination and eating. JM data from a non-lactating jersey cow were recorded continuously for 72 h. The cow was fed 1800 g of barley straw and 1375 g of dried sugarbeet pulp pellets twice daily. Average times spent eating and ruminating daily were 294 and 462 min. Successive rumination and eating JM were grouped into series when pauses between JM were equal to or longer than a fixed time interval corresponding to the minimum time interval between successive rumination cycles. Time intervals between successive JM, amplitude (the magnitude of the jaw's movement) and number of chews per series of successive JM were calculated for all rumination and eating series and included in the discriminant analyses. The combination of the four variables, basic chewing rate (BCR), mean of amplitude/standard deviation of amplitude, ln(number of chews) and standard deviation of time intervals between successive jaw movements, gave the least minutes of misclassified chewing behaviour per day (3% of total daily chewing time) and yielded a quadratic discriminant function. The order of the variables mentioned rank the variables according to their ability to classify the series. Combinations of the variables BCR and ln(number of chews), and other variables based on mean and standard deviation of time intervals between successive JM and amplitude of JM, can be used with advantage for classifying series of successive JM into rumination and eating behaviour.",

Nine monozygotic twin pairs of Friesian or Red Danish cattle were used, and pair-fed à diet consisting of grass silage, barley and soybean meal. Within each pair, one animal was given daily subcutaneous injections of 20 IU of pituitary-derived bGH (15–20 mg), while the other animal was injected with saline (excipient). Treatments started at 179±2 kg body weight and lasted for 15.6 weeks. At slaughter, carcass composition and meat quality were analyzed. bGH treatment increased gain by 8% (948 vs. 877 g/d; P <0.03). The amount of saleable meat in carcass and lean content of four main carcass cuts were on average increased by 2% (P <0.05). Concomitantly, carcass fat trim was reduced by 12% (P <0.001), fat trim of individual cuts by 4–21% (P <0.05), and kidney fat by 13% (P <0.01). Except for a 20% reduction of intramuscular fat content (P <0.001), meat quality assessed by objective as well as subjective methods was unaffected by bGH treatment. In summary, bGH treatment of dairy heifers around puberty stimulated growth and reduced carcass fattening including intramuscular fat, while eating quality of the meat was unaffected.",

The amount of DF in the high-fibre diet was supplied by dried sugar beet pulp (20%) and oats, wheat bran and grass pellets. The intake of metabolizable energy (ME) was similar for both the low-fibre and the highfibre diet, with an average daily intake of 30.74 MJ. Digestibility of DM, organic matter, protein, fat and energy was significantly decreased by a high DF level, but no effect of the diets was observed on the stage of pregnancy. A high fibre level significantly increased the digestibility of DF, indicating that fibre from sugar beet pulp is more fermentable than fibre from cereals. Protein utilization increased during the pregnancy, but at a very low level, indicating that the protein level in diets for pregnant sows could be lower. Inclusion of extra DF in the diet significantly increased the amount of energy excreted as CH4. Heat production was affected by diet, although not significantly (28.77 vs. 29.72 MJ day-1 in the low-fibre and highfibre diets, respectively). The utilization of ME for energy retention was lower for the high-fibre diet as a result of increased hind-gut fermentation. There was similar relation between the net energy of the standard and the high-fibre diet either calculated using the official Danish feed evaluation (0.77) or experimental estimated value (0.81).",

Sham dustbathing behaviour on the wire floor is common in furnished cages despite the presence of a dustbath with litter and we tested the hypothesis that such sham dustbathing may be a result of social competition for limited dustbathing space. No support for this hypothesis was found since very little sham dustbathing took place when the dustbath was occupied by another hen.

Previous work showed that glucocorticoid hormones repress expression of CD62L and CD18, causing neutrophilia and increased mastitis susceptibility in dairy cows. The aim of this study was to determine whether bovine neutrophil sensitivity to glucocorticoids exhibits genetic variability. Test animals included 60 pedigreed Holstein bulls treated on 3 consecutive days with a synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) and five untreated control bulls. Five indicator traits of neutrophil glucocorticoid sensitivity were monitored, including circulating neutrophil counts and two measures on each of CD62L and CD18 expression. Random regression models with treatment-specific serial correlation were used to estimate genetic and non-genetic sources of variation before, during and after glucocorticoid administration. Significant genetic variation was observed for neutrophil CD18 expression, with longitudinal heritability estimates ranging from 0.10 to 0.54 and influenced by dexamethasone. Significant genetic variation was also observed for blood neutrophil counts (heritability estimates ranging from 0.11 to 0.24) but was not influenced by dexamethasone administration. Estimated genetic correlations between circulating neutrophil counts and various indicators of CD62L and CD18 expression were large and negative (-0.44 to - 0.78). These results imply significant genetic variability and pleiotropic effects for neutrophil traits that are important for stress-induced disease susceptibility in dairy cattle and might be exploited by genetic selection.",

Experiment was conducted over 16 weeks with 27-wk-old Hisex Brown laying hens. Hens were randomly assigned to five experimental diets in a single isolated control group—2 (energy level)×2 (enzyme supplementation)—factorial arrangement. Experimental groups consisted of corn diet (control), and wheat-based (600 g kg−1) diets at the normal (11.51 MJ/kg ME, identical with the corn diet) and low energy levels (11.05 MJ/kg ME) with or without enzyme supplementation. Diets were fed in mash form. No significant interactions between energy level and enzyme supplementation on hen performance were observed. However, enzyme addition to wheat-based diets significantly improved laying rate, eggs mass and feed efficiency: the results were similar to those of hens fed the corn diet. Final body weight gain, egg shape index, breaking strength, shell thickness and incidence of dirty eggs were not significantly affected by the dietary energy level and enzyme supplementation. In the wheat-based diets, dirty eggs rate (2.07%) was higher than in the corn diet (0.21%). There was no significant interaction between energy level and enzyme supplementation for egg yolk colour but enzyme addition to wheat-based diets increased egg yolk pigmentation, which was also lower than that of the corn diet. These results demonstrated that wheat can replace corn in layer diets, and the addition of enzyme to wheat-based diets improved hen performance and egg yolk pigmentation. Energy enhancement of wheat by enzyme addition should be considered to achieve production and cost improvements in the formulation of layer diets.

The method was tested during three summer seasons in a total of eight sheep flocks grazing in three different mountain ranges. In total, three inspectors and four dogs were involved. Significant reductions in the number of sheep lost were achieved in one of the study areas. Lack of significance in the other areas was mainly due to the size of the area and qualities of the dogs: the range to be patrolled by one man dog unit should not exceed 10-12 km 2 , and the dogs should be experienced guard dogs which are properly socialized for this method.",

The feeds studied were untreated and expander treated barley and oats, solvent extracted rapeseed meal (RSM) and soybean meal (SBM), lignosulfonate treated SBM (SoyPass) and fish meal (FM). The nylon bags were recovered in ileum by trapping the bags with a magnet. The functionality of the technique was considered good although a metallic slice in the bags increased intestinal retention time. Compared to intact feed, pre-incubation 16 hours in the rumen increased digestibility of dietary protein and amino acids. The indigestible residues were in general lower in bags recovered in faeces than in ileum. In addition, some variation in digestibility among amino acids within feedstuffs seems to exist. The general conclusion was that the procedure of collecting bags in ileum can be skipped when digestibility of protein and amino acid is determined on rumen pre-incubated feed, but not when intact feed is used. Except for increased digestibility in intact barley, no major effect of expander treatment or lignosulfonate treatment on digestibility of protein and amino acids was found.

Some farmers select pelt size and fur quality indirectly using live animal evaluations (grading traits). In order to be able to define breeding goals properly, heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated for size traits and fur quality traits. There were four pelt character traits (pelt size, pelt colour darkness, pelt colour clarity and pelt quality) measured on dried skins, and six grading traits (animal size, grading colour darkness, grading colour clarity, underfur density, guard hair coverage and grading quality). The data included 54,680 animals born during the years 1987–2002, originating from seven farms. The heritabilities were high for pelt colour darkness and grading colour darkness, moderate for pelt size and low for other traits. In general, heritability of a pelt character trait was higher than its corresponding grading trait. Genetic correlations within the pelt character traits were low (∼0.11) and within the grading traits mainly moderate or high (∼0.44). There was high genetic correlation between pelt darkness and grading darkness, pelt quality and grading density, pelt size and animal size; between pelt quality and grading quality and between pelt colour darkness and grading guard hair coverage. This suggests that selection of pelt character traits via grading traits in most cases is relatively effective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The genetic associations between racing performance and preselection of horses considered as the binary trait racing status (trotters without or with at least one racing performance in life were classified as 0 and 1, respectively) as well as disqualified races (disqualified and non-disqualified trotters were classified as 1 and 0, respectively) were analysed in German trotters. Variance components for racing performance traits square root of rank at finish, racing time per km, and log of earnings with racing status were estimated based on an animal model using REML. Heritabilities of racing status, racing time and rank at finish were 0.30, 0.21, and 0.06, respectively. The genetic correlations between racing status and racing time or rank at finish were −0.74 and −0.32, indicating that horses started at least once showed a higher genetic potential in racing time or finishing ability than never started horses. This showed the high preselection of German trotters especially based on racing time. To account for this preselection, it was recommended for additional use of racing status in the German evaluation system. Breeding values of the three racing performance traits were estimated by two distinct models, in- or excluding racing status and compared by using three criteria. Racing time per km showed the highest correlation (r=0.98) between breeding values evaluated by these two distinct models. Therefore, incorrect selection rate of horses using breeding values from the model without racing status, was lowest for racing time per km (9.7%). Selection response increased about 1% for this trait after including racing status in the model. For the estimation of rank at finish, inclusion of racing status in the multiple trait model was much more important as indicated by a low correlation between breeding values (r=0.29) and high percentage of incorrectly selected stallions (97.5%). The trait disqualified races was first analysed using an univariate threshold model. Heritability of this trait was low (h 2=0.12) and repeatability (r=0.43) showed a moderate magnitude. Using a linear multiple trait animal model, disqualified races showed a low heritability (h 2=0.05) and a moderate favourable genetic correlation (r g=0.43) with racing time per km. Consequently, selection on racing time per km is expected to improve indirectly the reliability of racing performance. Combined selection of reduction in disqualified races and racing time may even further improve the reliability of racing trotters.",

A multi-trait linear sire model was used for estimation of covariance components, and the efficiencies of single- versus multi-trait multi-lactation (MT) sire evaluations were compared. Heritability of SCS and CM in the first three lactations ranged from 0.11 to 0.13 and 0.02 to 0.03, respectively. Within lactation, genetic correlations between SCS and CM ranged from 0.68 to 0.72.

Residual and phenotypic correlations were low and ranged from 0.09 to 0.13 and from 0.10 to 0.13, respectively. The absolute difference between genetic and residual correlations was from 0.5 to 0.6. Within-lactation genetic correlations between traits that are much less than unity suggest a multi-trait model for genetic evaluation of mastitis resistance. Comparison of model prediction performance between single-trait (ST) and MT models using a data splitting method showed that the MT model was more stable in predicting breeding values in future records of animals. Especially, for young sires and CM, the SD of EBVs from the MT model was 14 to 23% higher than the ST model, indicating more effective use of information in terms of revealing more genetic variation.",

Mean incidences of stillbirth were low and differed little between first and second parity, 3.6% vs. 2.5%. At first calving, the heritability of stillbirth on the visible scale was 0.7–1.3% for the direct effect and 0.5–0.9% for the maternal effect. For calving difficulty, the heritabilities were around 2.5% and 1.8–2.1% for direct and maternal effects, respectively. At second calving the corresponding heritabilities for the two traits were of the same order as at first parity, albeit somewhat lower for stillbirth. The genetic correlations between first and second calving results were around 0.8 for direct and maternal effects in stillbirth and around 0.7 for calving difficulty. Univariate models for first and second calvings, analysed separately and together in a repeatability model, were compared with a bivariate model which was assumed to be the most correct. The correlations between bulls’ transmitting abilities for stillbirth were 0.94–0.96 between results for first calving analysed with a bivariate model and results from the repeatability model. It was concluded that calving traits at first and second parities could be treated approximately as the same trait. Bivariate analyses, or a repeatability model, including calving results for both heifers and cows should be preferred in genetic evaluations of SRB bulls as sires and maternal grandsires.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sixteen Swedish Red steers were fed a hempseed cake (HC) or soybean meal (SM) protein supplement. Lipid extract from fresh and cooked M. longissimus dorsi were analysed. Diet comparison showed that HC had increased monounsaturated fatty acid proportion, primarily 18:1 cis-9 in the meat (P<0.05). Additionally, HC steers had higher proportions of 18:1 trans-11 and 18:2 c-9, t-11 (P<0.05). Furthermore, HC steers had decreased n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio compared to SM steers (P<0.05). Cooking increased polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and n-6 level, particularly 18:2n-6 and 20:4n-6 (P<0.05). Cooking decreased the proportion of 17:0 and 18:0 (P<0.05). In polar lipid, HC steers had lower saturated fatty acid (P<0.05) and higher PUFA levels (P<0.05). Warner-Bratzler shear force and lipid content were unaffected by dietary treatment. Cooking decreased the triacylglycerol level of both groups (P<0.01). We conclude that HC is a viable alternate supplement for beef diets which improves the meat FA profile.

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract Breeding for larger size in the blue fox has been successful. Today, most of the animals are large and fat at pelting time, but obesity is also more common. Extreme fatness is detrimental especially for young vixens, because fattening followed by fast and pronounced weight loss for the breeding season has a negative impact on litter size and other fertility traits. Fatness needs to be taken into account in new breeding strategies, and easy ways to record it are required. We developed a simple and quick body condition scoring (BCS) method for the evaluation of stored body fat in foxes. Correlated BCS with ultrasonic measurement of subcutaneous fat thickness, whole-carcass fat content, body weight, grading size and animal length was positive. We suggest that the BCS method can serve as a useful and practical tool for assessing the degree of fatness in the blue fox.

During the last three decades, the BW, HG and BL has increased indicating change in body conformation. The BW prediction equation based on early 70s data underestimate the BW of modern Ayrshire cows. Based on current data it is recommended to use different models to predict BW for primiparous and multiparous cows. From single measurements, HG predicted BW most accurately. Inclusion of BL in model gave slight improve in BW prediction, especially for primiparous cows. An additional term of age or days in milk (DIM) for primiparous cows and BCS or DIM for multiparous cows along with HG increased slightly the accuracy of BW prediction.",

The level of inbreeding was about 12% in both breeds, with a rather wavy pattern during the past 50 years in the D⊘le. Considering the last generations only, the effective population size was found to be 152 in the D⊘le and 42 in the Nordland/Lyngen.

A model, HolosNor, was developed to estimate net GHG emissions, including soil C changes, from pig farms. Based on data from 2008 the estimated GHG intensity was 2.65 kg CO2eq kg−1 CW (range: 1.24–4.03). The production of the feed consumed by the pigs contributed most to total GHG emissions; accounting for 2.14 kg CO2eq kg−1 CW, or more than 80% of the total emissions. Our study estimated a large variation in GHG intensity among pig farms in Norway which indicates opportunity for incorporating mitigation practices. A valuable contribution of the current work is the framework of a farm-scale tool for assessing farm-specific mitigation options.",

Several population bottlenecks are known to have occurred and the population has at least twice declined below 100 animals. Here the genetic diversity of the breed was estimated using pedigree information, D-loop sequencing and microsatellite markers. The annual rate of inbreeding was estimated as 3% and the effective population size as 5.1 animals. The effective population size based on molecular markers was estimated in the range of 4.1–8.8 individuals and mtDNA D-loop sequencing identified only three haplotypes. The results presented here show the population to be highly inbred, fragmented and the level of genetic variation among the lowest found in livestock.

Given the direct farm-level costs of implementing specific abatement options as inputs, the sector model shows their likely impacts on agricultural production and land use in different regions. Most importantly, the sector-level model also includes indirect effects through product markets, i.e. changes in the balance of supply and demand. The sector model includes the endogenous structural development of agriculture, i.e. farm size growth and changes in production allocation in different regions. Hence, the dynamic sector model, while including specific descriptions of agricultural policies and markets, shows a consistent overall picture of the agricultural production development impacted by the GHG mitigation measures. The approach provides a unifying framework for farm-level analysis at multiple regions and scales.",

The glycerol/glucose mixture concentration in plasma increased markedly following an oral glycerol load. There was no increase in 1,3-propanediol, and the VFA pattern was unchanged in calves receiving ORS containing glycerol/glucose mixture, indicating that glycerol was rapidly absorbed into blood. Numbers of enterobacteria and lactobacilli were not affected by treatment, and glycerol-utilizing Lactobacillus reuteri was detected in calf feces irrespective of treatment and sampling time.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR5 gene may alter host immune response to flagellin and have an effect on susceptibility to infectious disease, as suggested by studies in humans and other animals. Here, a novel nonsynonymous SNP, G2239A leading to the transformation of Val by Met at the 747th amino acid, was first identified in TIR domain of porcine TLR5 gene. To examine whether SNP G2239A is functionally relevant, eukaryotic expression vector with site-directed mutagenesis at the site was constructed and its ability to activate the expression of TLR5-dependent reporter constructs was tested. Variant notably diminished the activation of reporter gene (p<0.05) when compared with wild type TLR5. SNP G2239A has an effect on the receptor function.",

    "abstract": "Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are long, homozygote segments of an individual's genome, traceable to the parents and might be identical by descent. Due to the lack of standards for quality control of genotyping and criteria to define ROH, Norwegian Red was used to find the effects of SNP density, genotyping quality control and ROH criteria on the detection of ROH. A total of 384 bulls were genotyped with the Illumina HD-chip containing 777,962 SNP markers. A total of 22 data subsets were derived to examine the effects of SNP density, quality control of genotyping and ROH criteria. ROH was detected by PLINK. High SNP density led to increased resolution, fewer false-positive ROH segment, and made it possible to detect shorter ROH. Considering the ROH criteria, we demonstrated that allowing for heterozygote SNP could generate false positives. Furthermore, genotyping quality control should be tuned towards keeping as many SNP as possible, also low minor allele frequency SNP, as otherwise many ROH segments will be lost.",

Samples have been analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results showed that 85.6% of sheep and 45.6% of cows had inadequate (≤100 ng/mL) level of WB-Se concentration. The WB-Se concentration was significantly higher in both Se supplemented sheep and cows than in those without any Se supplementation. The WB-Se concentration was inadequate at all farms without Se supplementation. Therefore, Se should be supplemented to the animal feed or Se-biofortified feed used to ensure adequate level of Se in cows and sheep in all the Balkan countries.",

Observations of sows drinking, standing, lying sternal and being in the drinker location decreased after induction. Lying lateral frequency, regardless of side, increased after sows were induced lame. Frequency in the home pen location increased, but no differences were observed for feed bunk location after sows were induced lame. The induced lame foot had no observed effect on lying side preference. By the end of the round, all behavioral and location frequencies returned to baseline levels.

HGP7 measures thicknesses of fat and meat layers. The HGP7 measurements of subcutaneous fat, sirloin height and interior fat layer should be included as predictor variables together with gender. For efficiency at the slaughter-line gender might be omitted. The empirical Bayes method improved prediction precision only marginally compared with the standard ordinary least-squares method when applied to the full set of data.

Generally, irrespectively of housing system, Swedish Red cows had higher CR, more intensive oestruses and longer oestrus durations compared to Swedish Holstein cows.

The values for rumen degradability of grass N corrected for microbial contamination were generally high and they decreased with increasing maturity. The intestinal N digestibility of rumen-undegradable N of grass ranged from 49% to 78%, being affected by growth stage and the duration of preceding rumen incubation time.

All diets were supplemented with vitamins and minerals except for P, calcium, zinc and copper. The apparent digestibility of P was improved by up to 13% in the mutant lines. Although all diets were very similar in their zinc content, only rats fed the mutant lines had a net absorption and a positive zinc balance, indicating the improved availability of this mineral.

During gestation the gilts had been housed in stalls (n=8) or in pens (n=8).

    "abstract": "Various behavioural, physiological and production-related parameters were examined in 200 adult female pastel and pearl mink either family housed in three-room cages with no weaning or housed singly in one-room cages after normal weaning procedures. Scanning observations of behaviour and use of the cages were performed in the nursing period and several parameters related to reproduction were registered. The adult female mink were weighed when kits were 16 weeks old (September) and again at pelting time (November). Blood samples were collected from all adult female mink in September at which time the teat condition and fur damage were evaluated. After pelting, bite marks on the leather side of the skin were counted, fur damage was graded after severity and the fur size was measured. Some positive consequences of being family housed were revealed. The familyhoused adult female mink showed a lower level of stereotypes and a higher level of defensiveness and curiosity than the adult female mink in one-room cages during the nursing period. In September and November, family-housed adult females were heavier than singly housed adult females. However, most of the physiological or production-related parameters pointed in a negative direction for familyhoused adult female mink. Reproductive success was somewhat reduced, although not significantly. Plasma cortisol levels were elevated in September, indicating higher levels of stress in these females. They showed a generally poor teat condition in September, with a high proportion of swollen or bitten teats. A high proportion of these adult females showed fur damage in both September and November, and a high number of bite marks was found on the leather side of the skins of these females, indicating that family housing had a high cost for the adult female mink. In conclusion, there seem to be some benefits, at least on the behavioural level, in keeping adult female mink in three-room cages during the nursing period, but both physiological and production-related parameters indicated that the welfare of the adult female mink was threatened if she was continuously cohoused with her litter past the normal age of weaning.",

Four blood samples were collected during the day from a catheter in the jugular vein: one sample was collected 0.5 h before morning feeding while the other three samples were collected 2, 4 and 6 h after the morning feeding. The effect from previously fed diets on the specific response from the test diet was investigated. However, only the diet fed on the previous day was found to influence the values of PUN before the morning feeding. The reported experiments included nine different diets fed to six pigs in six different feeding designs, all requiring 1 or 2 days for investigating the test diet. The diet used in the morning feeding also significantly influenced the concentration of PUN during the following 6 h. In general, a good agreement was found between the calculated biological value (BV) of the diet and the response of PUN. It was concluded that analysis of PUN can be used as a rapid response parameter for testing the protein quality of the diet and, consequently, this analysis may also be used as a rapid method for determining amino acid requirements in pigs.

In experiment I, 42 cross-bred gilts [live weight (LW) 35-40 kg] were fitted with a simple T-cannula at the terminal ileum. Seven experimental diets (four feedstuffs: barley, wheat, soyabean meal and rapeseed meal, and three mixtures with varying compositions of the same feedstuff batches) were investigated. Each diet was fed at six different CP levels, obtained after dilution with a 1:1 mixture of sucrose and dextrose. In total, 42 different diets were used and on each pig three different diets were tested. In experiment II, 12 (LW , 18 kg) plus eight (LW , 88 kg) cross-bred castrates were fitted with a simple T-cannula at the terminal ileum. Four experimental diets based on casein as the sole protein source and with CP dietary levels from 6 to 25% were used. By extrapolation to zero CP intake the basal endogenous protein loss in experiment I was 15.7 g kg -1 dry matter (DM) intake, when including all diets, and 14.3 g kg -1 DM intake after excluding the barley diets. In experiment II the basal endogenous CP loss was 11.3 g kg -1 DM intake. In experiment I a relative increase in almost all amino acids in the endogenous CP loss was found when the dietary CP level in the diets increased from zero to 17%. Exceptions were glycine, which was constant, and proline, which decreased significantly from 176 to 58 g 160 g -1 CP. However, the sum of proline and glutamic acid in the endogenous protein loss was almost constant. Similar results were obtained after correction for undigested dietary CP and amino acids, based on in vitro analyses of CP digestibility. In a supplementary study, ileal samples, selected for unusually high levels of proline were analysed for free amino acids. For proline, 36-64% was free, whereas insignificant proportions of the other amino acids were free. It is concluded that the composition of endogenous CP is generally relatively constant. However, experimental conditions with low or inappropriate dietary CP supply may influence the composition and occasionally induce unexpected high levels of proline from secretion of free proline into the lumen of the digestive tract.",

The annual cycle of the daily photoperiod has been identified as the determinant factor of this phenomenon, while environmental temperature, nutritional status and social interactions may modulate it. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge of reproductive seasonality in sheep. Following general consideration of the importance of seasonal breeding as a reproductive strategy for the survival of the species, the paper describes manifestations of seasonality in both the ram and the ewe. Both determinant and modulating factors are discussed, and special emphasis is given to the neuroendocrine base of photoperiodic regulation of seasonal breeding. Other aspects such as the role of melatonin, the progestogens and ram effects with or without anestrus period are also reviewed.",

The decline in degradability was more pronounced with increasing maturity in timothy than in red clover during spring growth, but similar during summer growth. Red clover contained more components soluble in neutral detergent solution (NDS) at all harvest occasions. The fractional degradation rate for the NDS fraction was lower in red clover compared to timothy. Red clover had slightly higher fractional degradation rate for the whole forage, but the total kinetic release of energy was similar for the two species at the same harvest time. The results indicate that timothy and red clover have different intrinsic characteristics limiting degradation. Effects of the treatments with NDS on the allocation of pectins could partially explain the differences in degradation characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient and significant safety margins have until now been included in both feeding recommendations for cattle and allocation of P in practice. However, there is a need to optimize the utilization of P in cattle and thereby minimize its allocation and excretion. This demands well-defined requirements and availabilities of P in feeds as well as fairly precise use of this knowledge in practice. The purpose of this paper is to review the current knowledge and to give proposals for feeding phosphorus to cattle in relation to physiological requirement, availability of phosphorus in feeds, and minimal excretion of P. There is scientific and practical basis for a reduction of recommendations and allocation of P to cattle in the Nordic countries. No evidence or indication is found that surplus P relative to physiological requirement is beneficial. Future P feeding recommendations should continuously be based on the factorial method. The quantitatively most important improvement will be the increase and differentiation of the TAC value (true availability coefficient), which can be raised from 0.55 to 0.65 and 0.70 for the most common feeds. However, there is still no basis for a specific TAC for an individual feedstuff. When applying the recommended P allocation, it will be possible to increase the utilization of P in, e.g. high producing dairy cows, to 35–40%.",

The following equation was proposed to predict total nitrogen excretion (TNE) (g/d) based on milk urea nitrogen (MUN) (mg/dl): TNE = 15.46(±1.83)×MUN + 193.40(±28.79).

Two experimental groups included 20 cows each and the study was carried out during two indoor periods. For cows fed the rapeseed cake diet, milk yield increased by 3.0 kg/day, but contents of milk fat and milk protein of multiparous cows decreased, resulting in similar yields of energy-corrected milk in early lactation. Milk from cows fed rapeseed cake had increased content of unsaturated fatty acids, including conjugated linoleic acid. In conclusion, it is possible to maintain milk production of dairy cows fed 100% organic feedstuffs using cold-pressed rapeseed cake as the main protein source compared to a 95% organic ration.",

However, mortality rate of twin lambs (19.2%) was significantly higher than that of single lambs (5.7%). Kivircik ewes did not increase the total maternal care to their lambs when they lambed twins, and time that the lamb received grooming attention in twin born lambs was about half of the time received grooming in single born lambs.

Oxidative off-flavor was most common during the first 3 weeks of lactation. However, when adjusting for copper concentration the odds ratio for incidence of SOF was instead highest in lactation weeks 14–39.

We found that questing tick abundance was higher in areas without sheep, suggesting that sheep alter vegetation in turn reducing tick survival. However, we cannot exclude that other mechanisms may also lead to reduced abundance of questing ticks; sheep may negatively affect the local density of red deer which is an important alternative host.

Adjusting the exponents for dietary concentration of ether extract, proportion of non-fibre carbohydrates of total carbohydrates and organic matter digestibility improved the models, and the effects of all these factors were significant (at least P<0.05) with both models.

Apart from measuring, simulations are frequently used to investigate management impacts on GHG emissions. The HOLOS model has been developed (using country specific emission factors) to explore potential mitigation practices with respect to GHG emission reduction or increased carbon storage. However, avoided GHG emissions can create nutrient surpluses, and thus other environmental hazards (e.g. for human and/or ecosystem health). We propose to expand the “Virtual Farm” concept by connecting the budgets carbon, nitrogen, and energy flows, and thus estimate environmental impacts as a function of management choices, environment, and climate influence. Initial tests to combine HOLOS with the carbon model Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) in Norway have been promising.

Pigs fed the SC diet had the lowest weight gain (P = 0.001), while pigs fed the SE diet performed similarly to those fed the control diet. Carcass weight and dressing percentage differed between the diets (P = 0.016 and P = 0.018), but there was no difference in lean meat content (P = 0.832).

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of dietary FB inclusion on diet digestibility. A further aim was to find an optimal inclusion level of locally produced unprocessed FB seeds in diets of broilers. A total of 196 male Ross 508 chicks were randomly assigned to four feeding treatments, and seven replications per treatment. FB seeds in proportions of 0, 80, 160, and 240 g/kg in the wheat- and SBM-based diets were tested in the grower period (bird age of 6–32 days). Digestibility and retention of nutrients were determined at the end of the experiment, and production performance was measured throughout the experiment. Apparent total tract digestibility of ash, nitrogen retention, apparent ileal digestibility of organic matter, and the nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy increased, with increased FB inclusion. The apparent ileal digestibilities of alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, histidine, and treonine increased by FB inclusion, while the apparent ileal digestibilities of cysteine and proline decreased. Digestibility differences were related to FB inclusion, but as well changes in proportion of wheat and SBM. Body weight, body weight gain, and feed consumption linearly decreased when dietary FB inclusion increased, while feed conversion ratio linearly improved. FB inclusion had no negative effect on the health of the broilers. In conclusion, 160 g/kg of FB can be used in broiler diets without major negative effects on production performance.",

There were no significant differences in rooting activity between genotypes; however, the 'traditional' genotype grazed significantly more than the 'modern' genotype. The vegetation cover declined significantly faster in the paddocks with restrictedly fed pigs than in the paddocks with pigs fed according to recommendations.

At the individual level across analysed populations, the formation of clusters in respect to breed's origin and particular studs was observed. The Wright's FST and genetic distances indicated genetic segregation of both colour varieties at the intraspecific level of the Kladruber breed.

Median labour time for all herds was 17 hours/cow/year with a general lower workload per cow for large herds compared to small herds. Labour demand during the grazing period was however more dependent on the structure of pastures than herd size. The calving period was the most labour-intensive period, whereas supervision on pasture was the most time-consuming task both during the grazing period and the entire year. Large variations among herds indicates that there are often great opportunities for achieving a decreased labour time, not the least in small herds.",

High-moisture barley reduced feed:grain ratio compared with dry barley, the difference being significant (p < 0.05) for the anaerobically stored barley in one experiment.

A total of 201 litters were studied. Pen hygiene in the slatted floor pens in general was significantly better in all trials, and there was a demonstrably higher amount of bacteria in the solid floor pens. Total mortality from birth to weaning was significantly higher for the solid floor treatment group, primarily due to more traumatic injuries and more infection losses. No significant treatment effects on morbidity and daily weight gain were observed. In conclusion, even in a closed herd with batch farrowing, good general hygiene level and good herd immunity, a small change such as solid flooring in the dung area can negatively affect pig health and production before weaning.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrasonic scanning was used to measure muscle depth and fat depth at the third lumbar vertebra of 556 ram lambs of the Norwegian Dala and Spælsau breeds in three ram circles in 1990. After slaughter, carcass weight, carcass grade, muscling score, fat score and weight of kidney and kidney fat were recorded. The increase in accuracy of predicting carcass weight and grade by including ultrasonic measurements in addition to weaning weight was low, whereas a considerable increase in accuracy of fat score was observed for Dala. A genetic analysis of 355 recorded progeny sired by 44 young Dala rams was made. Estimates of heritabilities from the REML procedure were: 0.46 ± 0.22 for muscle depth and 0.26 ± 0.17 for fat depth. Genetic correlations were estimated. The accuracy of the selection indexes for carcass weight, carcass grade or fat score increased significantly when ultrasonic measures were added compared to use of weaning weight and sire records only.",

Data consisted of records of 2394, 5002 and 1098 bulls of the breeds Danish Red, Danish Friesian and Jersey, respectively, which were correlated according to breed with 11846, 62875 and 10954 daughters sand their contemporaries, respectively. The bull traits included hoof measurements, horn characteristics and claw disease frequencies recorded at hoof trimming, while the data for the dairy cows contained the scores for rear leg side view, rear leg rear view, bone structure, quality of hocks and foot angle. The correlations between the claw diseases or horn characteristics on one side and the daughters' conformation on the other side were either negligible or inconclusive, while those between the bull's hoof measurements and the two conformation traits bone structure and hock quality were of statistical significance for all three breeds. Moreover, the stance of the rear leg showed a significant relationship to claw measurements in Danish Red and Jersey cattle. Small feet in bulls were correlated with a favourable expression of feet and legs in daughters. An improvement in foot and leg conformation traits in dairy cattle is possible by including claw measurements in the selection of future AI bulls.

For this purpose a questionnaire on the environmental characteristics of dairy farms and the reactions of cattle was prepared and submitted to 220 dairy farms. The data were obtained from interviews with farmers and from veterinarians' direct observations of the animals' reactions and farm structures. Preliminary data show that on the majority of the farms the animals were calm in the presence of the stockman and had no negative reactions relating to the presence of unfamiliar man. However, it is interesting to note the rapid turnover of milking personnel in 66% of the farms. Regarding abnormal behaviour, intersuckling in cows was detected on less than 20% of farms. This study, the first done at dairy farm level in Italy, is a first step towards finding a tool for veterinarians and farmers to assess dairy cow welfare.",

The research project described in this paper investigates the precision of TGI 35 L assessments. TGI scores were assessed several times on 12 dairy farms by different persons and in two investigations. The repeatability between persons was 94%. This means that animal welfare can be assessed sufficiently precisely by making one assessment per farm. The precision of the assessment could be further improved by regular training of assessors and by incorporating the results of experience gained into the index instructions.",

The treatments were four rations with a silage proportion of 15, 30, 60 and 100% of the dry matter. Records were taken of the individual intake of silage, concentrates, mineral supplements and water, and excretions by collecting all urine and faeces. All feeds, urine, faeces and water were analysed for their content of Al, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Na, Ni, P, S, Se, and Zn. Elements that were mainly excreted in faeces (Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, P, and Zn) tended to have a constant uptake in amount. As there is a fairly good correlation between DM consumption and faeces production, it is possible to estimate the amount of these elements excreted at farm level by analysing a faeces sample. Elements that are excreted in significant amounts in both faeces and urine (Cl, K, Mg, Mo, N, Na, S, and Se) tended to have a constant uptake over treatments as a fraction of the feed content. It is more difficult to estimate the amounts of these elements at farm level because it is more difficult to predict urine production than faeces production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objectives were to derive economic values (EVs) and their standard deviations for dairy cow traits in Denmark under future possible production circumstances using a stochastic bio-economic farm model. EVs were derived for three different scenarios with the first representing current Danish production circumstances. The other two scenarios were based on a report with predictions of expected developments in the Danish agricultural sector with respect to structural development and market situation. The three scenarios differed with respect to herd size, level of trait, prices and presence of milk quota. EVs for functional traits differed only slightly between scenarios, but without a milk quota the relative importance of milk yield compared to the functional traits increased. Under current production circumstances with milk quota, EVs of milk yield and body weight were 0.13 and −0.51 €/kg per cow-year. For milk fever, mastitis, retained placenta and laminitis EVs were −277, −124, −39 and −127 €/incidence/cow-year. The EVs for involuntary culling, stillbirth, conception rate and days from first calving to first heat were −5.2, −0.61, 1.69 €/%/cow-year and −0.62 €/day/cow-year. Standard deviations of EVs expressing variation in realised farm profit were lower in a situation with fixed number of cows on the farm than in a situation with milk quota.

    "abstract": "The quality of silage is of great importance because it benefits animal production, animal health and food quality. This study examined the impact of mixtures of sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite, hexamine (HMTA), sodium propionate, sodium bisulphite, and propionic acid on silage quality in low- and high-wilted grass/clover mixtures. Additionally, it was focused on the nitrite concentration in the silages. The silage (wilted to 300 or 600 g dry matter kg−1 of fresh weight) consisted of 50% red clover (Trifolium pratense) and 50% timothy (Phleum pratense). The forage was not chopped, and was ensiled in two types of silo: 25-litre stainless steel laboratory silos, stored for 120 days and 1.7-litre glass silos, stored for 14 days. The effect of silage additives in improving the fermentation process, reduction of clostridial growth and silage losses was achieved in low-wilted silages whereas the impact on aerobic stability enhancement was pronounced in both low and high dry matter silage. The combination of sodium benzoate and sodium bisulphite had an unsatisfactory effect on the reduction of nutrient losses and improvement of aerobic stability. A mixture of 672 g sodium benzoate, 425 g sodium propionate, and 1890 g propionic acid effectively improved the silage quality. The application of 465 g sodium benzoate, 360 g sodium nitrite, 240 g hexamine, and 165 g sodium propionate at a dose of 3 litres per tonne fresh matter was sufficient to inhibit clostridial and yeast growth and increase silage stability in low-wilted forages, whereas a mixture of 698 g sodium benzoate, 540 g sodium nitrite, 360 g hexamine, and 248 g sodium propionate at a dose of 4.5 litres per tonne was more effective at higher dry matter. The nitrite-N concentration in silages was far below the toxic level.",

The stochastic model used is dynamic, and simulates production and health in a dairy herd. Because of indirect effects between traits, the phenotypic levels of (related) traits can change as a result of genetic changes. Economic values for milk production and body weight were 0.28 and −0.76 [euro]/kg per cow-year respectively. For incidence of milk fever, mastitis, retained placenta and laminitis economic values were −402.1, −162.5, −79.0 and −210.2 [euro]/incidence per cow-year. The economic values for involuntary culling rate, stillbirth and conception rate were –6.66, −1.63, and 1.98 [euro]/% per cow-year, respectively and the economic value for days from calving to first heat was −0.94 [euro]/day per cow-year. Standard deviations of economic values expressing variation in realised profit of a farm before and after a genetic change were computed using a linear Taylor series expansion. Expressed as coefficient of variation, standard deviations of economic values based on 1000 replicates ranged between 0.07 (milk production) to 16 (retained placenta).",

Genetic correlations between MD and FORM, and FD and FAT were positive and favourable. It was concluded that ultrasound measures on live animals are good predictors for final carcass classification, and can be useful in a breeding programme where carcass traits are included.",

Patent law is general in form and is seldom adapted to single areas of innovation. It was initially created for the purpose of granting exclusive rights to technical inventions; and it was taken for granted that higher animals, food production and pharmaceuticals were too important for mankind to be included under exclusive private rights. When patent law now is becoming increasingly in use in the animal sector, it is an unanswered question how the law will apply to this particular field of innovation. There is legal uncertainty of how the courts will apply the general law to this particular field. Patent law has the potential to alter the existing legal conditions for competition and investments in the field of animal breeding, and needs therefore a higher level of awareness among policy makers, animal breeders and farmers.",

Three experiments were carried out to include common feeding systems and seasonal variation in slaughter for Norwegian lamb. The first experiment was conducted in September 2001 using 40 lambs subjected to grazing on the mountain ranges or cultivated lowland pastures. A follow up experiment was conducted during March and April 2002 using 107 lambs fed indoors by farmers. The third experiment was conducted during October and November 2003 using 84 lambs subjected to either ad libitum or restricted concentrate supplementation under stall-feeding. Except for the March/April experiment, meat from ewe lambs had sour odour scores comparable (P>0.05) to that of ram lambs. On the other hand, meat from ram lambs had higher (P<0.05) scores for sour taste than that of ram lambs irrespective of time of slaughter. Further, in all but March/April slaughter time, meat from ewe lambs were comparable (P>0.05) to that of ram lambs in metallic taste. Whereas meat from ewe lambs slaughtered in September had ram taste comparable to that of ewe lambs, meat from ewe lambs slaughtered in March/April and October/November had 1.2 units and 0.6 units lower (P<0.05) ram taste, respectively, than that from ram lambs. It is concluded that to avoid off-flavour in Norwegian lamb, ram lambs should be slaughtered no later than September and hence consumer demand for fresh lamb in winter, spring and summer should preferentially be met by marketing ewe lambs.",

During phase 2, daily consumption of lysine, methionine+cystine and threonine was higher for outdoor than indoor pigs independent of amino acid level (p=0.002, 0.004 and 0.006, respectively). The outdoor pigs grew faster during phase 2 than the indoor pigs (p=0.001), although feed conversion ratio did not differ (p=0.358). Dressing percentage was higher for outdoor than for indoor pigs (p=0.011) but lean meat content did not differ (p=0.904). The health status of the pigs was evaluated and showed that the incidence of pigs seropositive to erysipelas was higher outdoors. Ascaris suum was present in both production systems, whereas Eimeria sp. only was found among outdoor pigs. The results indicate a discrepancy between pigs housed in different production systems rather than between pigs directed to different dietary amino acid levels. This suggests that growing/finishing pigs fed ad libitum can compensate for dietary amino acid levels lower than the current Swedish recommendations without affecting production results.",

Accordingly, between D-2 and D0, W43 piglets increased (P<0.001) time spent in aggression, exploration and locomotion. Conversely, W21 piglets were more active than W43 piglets on D1 (P<0.01). Timing of behaviour relative to weaning day differed between treatments; W21 piglets were more apathetic than W43 piglets just after weaning indicating a delay in the reaction of younger piglets to weaning and mixing. W21 piglets also had a greater and longer decrease in post-weaning eating incidence than W43 piglets, which is likely due to both older age and previous creep feed experience.",

No significant differences were observed in feed intake, final weight, average daily gain and feed to gain ratio (P > 0.05) among different treatments. The species richness and bacterial community diversities in feces were higher for the pigs in treatment BVAI and BVAII than those of pigs in the Control (36.5 and 1.55, respectively), with a significant difference between BVAII and the Control (P < 0.05). The bacterial communities of pigs in BVAI and BVAII clustered together, forming a cluster we designated as Cluster C and separated from another cluster in pigs fed antibiotic designated as Cluster A in the Control treatment. The results indicate that the 0.4% BV and 0.25% acidifier can replace antibiotics in the diets for piglets without negative effects on production and allow for greater diversity of the intestinal bacterial community compared to antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract This paper aims at assessing the status of animal welfare in Austria and Germany as it is regulated by private, national, and European animal welfare legislation. In order to achieve this, an inventory of existing private and state-driven animal welfare certification schemes that are relevant for fattening pigs in Austria and Germany is done, and the overlap between legislative and private certification requirements for animal welfare analyzed. The paper's methodological contribution lies in the development of an assessment approach based on the Austrian \"Animal Needs Index\" that allows the evaluation of minimum farm animal welfare standards without expensive and time-consuming on-farm measures. The comparison of legislative and private certification scheme pig standards indicate slight differences between the minimum animal welfare obligations of certification schemes existent in Austria and Germany whereas the reviewed Austrian scheme obligations show in general more diversification from the evaluated legislative standards.

Samples were collected every half hour for 8.5 hours postfeeding from two horses on two consecutive days. The caecal content of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), lactate, and ammonia (NH3N), as well as microbiota composition and pH were analyzed. Mixed Sangers sequences generated from universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA gene were used to analyze the microbiota composition. Three main phylogroups were identified and classified as Clostridium cluster XIVa, Clostridium cluster III, and lactic acid bacteria. Furthermore, we found that the composition of the caecal microbiota was closely associated with the VFA profile. Our main findings were that short-term microbial fluctuations occur in healthy hindgut fermenting horses as a response to feed intake.",

    "abstract": "Models are widely used to simulate the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). They help to identify knowledge gaps, estimate total emissions for inventories, develop mitigation options and policies, raise awareness and encourage adoption. These models vary in scale, scope and methodological approach. The scale increases from field, manure storage or rumen via herd or farm to country or continent. The scope may be restricted to a single GHG or include all gases. Multidisciplinary models may include nutrients, other substances or socio-economic parameters. Mechanistic process-based models have been developed from the knowledge of how GHG are produced in soils, animals and manures. These types of models often operate at the lower end of the scale, but they are also incorporated in farm and regional models. This paper discusses how the different types of models, as well as tools for farmers, are used to develop and evaluate mitigation strategies.",

Increased indoor space results in increased lying time, more synchronized lying behaviour, less displacements and higher milk yield in sheep, and increased lying time and lower frequency of agonistic behaviour in goats. Sheep and goats spend 45–50% of their time outdoors when given access to an outdoor yard during winter. Under normal thermal conditions, fully fleeced sheep do not need solid floors of welfare reasons in Norway. Neither do dairy goats in insulated buildings. The significance of different milk feeding strategies in goat kids is poorly documented, but studies on lambs and calves show that suckling increases the growth rate, gives better social competence and more exploratory behaviour. Thus, the organic regulations in Norwegian sheep and goat production have some positive impact on behavioural indicators of sheep and goat welfare, especially during winter housing.",

The models were compared both in terms of how accurately they predicted genetic trend when applied to the same dataset and regarding difference in true genetic progress when selecting on breeding values predicted by these models. A breeding structure resembling the Icelandic dairy cattle population was used for the simulation. The single-trait model underpredicted the true genetic trend in second and third lactations quite heavily but only by 2.3% in the first lactation, while the repeatability model overpredicted the true genetic trend in the first three lactations by 9.4% on average. The multitrait animal model, however, estimated genetic trends with a high degree of accuracy. When selection was made on all three lactations with equal economic weights, the multitrait model was only about 2.5% superior to the repeatability model in terms of true genetic trend. The multitrait animal model was applied to estimate genetic trend regarding milk production using real data from the Icelandic dairy cattle population. A total of 61 621 animals were included, of which 38 014 were cows with production records. The genetic trend for milk yield was estimated at 10.4, 10.0 and 9.3 (kg per year) in each of the three first lactations respectively.

The pigs were weaned at 4 weeks of age and from the age of 115 days half of the groups were subjected to a schedule of unpredictable, inescapable electroshocks for 33 days, and half served as control. The adrenocortical reactivity to ACTH stimulation and to an emotional stressor (the procedure associated with initiation of blood collection) was measured in females, whereas the behavioural and pituitary-adrenocortical reactivity to an open field test was measured in castrates, as was the behavioural reactivity in a social test. Intermittent stress increased adrenocortical reactivity to ACTH stimulation significantly. This effect was present within the first week of intermittent stress (p < 0.06), but no difference was found after 4–5 weeks of stress. In contrast, the adrenocortical reactivity to additional emotional stressors was unaffected by stress after one week of intermittent stress, but increased after 4–5 weeks. In the open field test, centre location increased after one week of intermittent stress, whereas exploration decreased and walking and ambulation increased after 4–5 weeks of stress. In addition, 4–5 weeks of intermittent stress decreased aggressiveness in a social test. In conclusion, the change in reactivity to an additional acute stressor during intermittent stress appeared in different variables and contexts at different times during the course of intermittent stress. Thus, assessment of stress based on changed reactivity has to include several distinct measures of behavioural and hormonal reactivity.",

    "abstract": "An experiment was conducted in eight Danish commercial dairy herds, using 168 Danish Friesian heifers for 5 months, from November 1995. Three groups were established in each herd: two small, homogeneous groups (SHom) with five light heifers (130-250 kg) or five heavy heifers (250-380 kg) and one large, heterogeneous group (LHet) with ten light and heavy heifers (130-380 kg). The space allowance per heifer was 4.5 m2 including a 2.7-m2 resting area (deep litter). Four herds were fed restrictive amounts of concentrate per pen and ammonium-treated straw ad libitum (RCS) and four herds were fed one ration of either silage or total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum (OR). The group composition had no general affect on the live weight gain (LWG). When using the RCS feeding system, the daily LWG in the LHet groups compared with the SHom groups decreased by 95 g for the light heifers, whereas it increased by 31 g for the heavy heifers. The average feed intake was 7% lower in the LHet groups than in the SHom groups (P=0.02). When heifers were fed RCS, light heifers spent less time eating concentrates (P=0.01) and for heavy heifers, there was a tendency to spend more time eating concentrates (P=0.10) in the LHet groups compared with SHom groups. The effect of group composition on synchronization of resting behaviour (when all heifers lie down simultaneously) revealed a tendency towards less synchronization in the LHet groups when fed OR (P=0.09), but not with RCS feeding (P=0.16) compared with the SHom groups. For heavy heifers, the aggression was decreased (P=0.02) when fed RCS, whereas it increased when heifers were fed OR (P=0.001) in the LHet groups compared with the SHom groups. Grouping criteria regardless of the feeding system did not influence the heifers' health. Whereas productivity was not decreased by increasing group size and group heterogeneity, the welfare of light heifers seems to some extent to be affected negatively by housing in a large heterogeneous group. Contrary to expectations, this negative effect could not be diminished by offering one ration (TMR or silage) ad libitum to the heifers.",

Lambing records for 124 571 Swedish pelt ewes (P), 8140 Svea breed ewes (X) and 3299 Swedish landrace finewool ewes (F) were broken down into subsets by parity. Parities 1 to 5 for P ewes, 1 to 4 for X ewes and 1 to 3 for F ewes were analysed with a linear mixed model that included random effects of flock-year and sire of the ewe and a fixed effect of sire birth-year class. When the non-linear threshold model was used on the same material, the fixed effect of thresholds was added to the above effects. Estimates of heritability were substantial and ranged from 0.07 to 0.40 for linear analyses and from 0.10 to 0.62 for threshold analyses. Litter size at birth generally displayed more additive genetic variation than litter size at weaning. Differences between heritability estimates from linear models and threshold models were largest in the earlier parities and for litter size at birth. Threshold estimates were consistently larger than linear estimates. Heritability was largest in the first parity (for litter size at birth in P, 0.35; in X, 0.62; and in F, 0.46) and decreased after that. Averaged over birth-year class, sire of ewe breeding values for litter size at birth increased annually at a rate of 0.04, 0.04 and 0.03 standard deviation units for P, X, and F, respectively. Average breeding values for litter size at weaning showed slightly higher increases for P and F - 0.06 and 0.03 standard deviation units, respectively - while that for X was lower - 0.02 standard deviation units. In all three breeds, genetic trend in first-parity litter size at birth for rams chosen as ewe sires was seen to be higher and more consistent than in later parities.",

The other part of the loin was chilled directly to 4°C and aged until 7 days post mortem. Ageing time was the most influential factor for Warner-Bratzler shear force, but chilling rate was also highly significant. Neither gender nor LV-ES had significant effects on tenderness in this study. The combination of electrical stimulation and rapid chilling did not improve tenderness as much as moderate chilling alone. This experiment showed that chilling rate during rigor and time of ageing were the two most important factors for the tenderness of beef M. longissimus dorsi.",

Emphases were placed on nursing behaviour patterns of relevance for the piglets' growth and survival in the multi-suckling pens. Ten groups of six sows were used. Behaviour was recorded for 24 h on days 1, 8 and 15 after the introduction to the multi-suckling pen. When the sows had farrowed in the get-away system significantly more nursings were initiated in the multi-suckling pen. Furthermore, the G-sows terminated a significantly smaller percentage of the nursings in the multi-suckling pens and there was significantly less cross-suckling compared with pens with C-sows. G-sows also tended (P = 0.08) to lose fewer piglets in the multi-suckling pens than C-sows. In conclusion, the results suggest that nursing behaviour in multi-suckling pens may be improved when the sows farrow in get-away systems as compared with crates.

The calves (mean liveweight±SD, 124±24 kg and 133±24 kg on Farm I and II respectively) were supplemented daily with 3 kg energy and protein-rich commercial concentrates (group EP), 3 kg barley (group E) or kg barley (group Eres) for 8 weeks following turn-out on pasture.

However, liveweights were similar between groups at housing, although group EP had significantly higher liveweight at housing on Farm I (P<0.01). Initial liveweight had effects on daily gain in the grazing season, but supplementation with energy and protein reduced this effect on Farm I. No clinical signs of coccidiosis were observed, but markedly higher levels of oocysts per gram faeces (opg) were observed on Farm II, using pastures previously grazed by cattle compared to Farm I. Calves having a maximum oocyst count above 5 000 opg were subclinically affected by coccidiosis, as indicated by low faecal dry matter and reduction in daily gain of 222 g/day (P<0.05). It is concluded that liveweight can be increased when supplementing calves with organic concentrates rich in energy and protein in the period following turn-out compared to supplementation with barley alone. However the overall gain at the end of the grazing season is limited due to compensatory growth in the grazing period following supplementation.",

Heifers grazed semi-natural grasslands, leys or a combination of semi-natural grasslands and leys in 33, 15 and 52% of the herds, respectively. According to Swedish recommendations, calves in a majority of the herds were fed too low concentrations of crude protein from weaning to 6 months of age and calves were fed too low a metabolizable energy content inadequate for a daily weight gain of 700 g at weaning. Median live weight gain from birth to calving was only 567 g per day.

The concentrations of pigment and glycogen (r g =0.27±0.05) were interrelated. Based on the heritability values and the signs of the genetic correlations the present data suggest that it is possible to select for higher ultimate pH and improved colour by selection for either lower muscle glycogen or higher pigment concentration, respectively. However, the positive genetic correlation between these two traits may restrict the efficiency of simultaneous selection for lower glycogen and higher pigment. All genetic parameter estimates presented are calculated across three purebreds. Values for each breed are warranted for use in pig production. However, this requires more animals per breed.",

Records containing information on approximately 200 000 cows were analysed using tri-variate animal models. The genetic correlations between the udder health traits and the fertility traits were favourable and in the range from 0.17 to 0.42, whereas the genetic correlations between protein yield and the fertility traits were unfavourable and ranged from 0.43 to 0.52. These results highlight the importance of continuing to emphasize functional traits in future breeding programmes. The genetic correlation between the fertility traits was 0.82. Based on this result, it cannot be concluded that NI and FLI are measures of the same trait.

The diet was fed without or with supplementation of dicalcium phosphate (diet A), phytase (diet BP), xylanase (diet BX) and phytase + xylanase (diet BPX). Apparent digestibility of P and Ca were higher in diets BP and BPX. Apparent digestibility of crude protein (CP) was higher in pigs which were fed the BPX diet than pigs which were fed the BP and BX diets. Pigs given diet BPX, had highest daily weight gain and had higher daily feed consumption, except for pigs given diet BP. In conclusion, phytase improved the utilisation of P and Ca, while xylanase alone had no positive effects on OM, CP and NDF digestibility. The combination of the two enzymes had some benefits in terms of CP digestibility and resulted in an improved feed intake and daily weight gain, while feed conversion ratio was unaffected.",

The purpose of this study was to estimate trends in inbreeding for these breeds. All five breeds have been recording pedigrees for decades, so pedigree completeness is adequate. The rate of inbreeding is more than 1% per generation in all breeds, and more than 2% per generation in the Danish breeds, which have no options for importing, if they aim to continue pure breeding. The Danish breeds have not allowed recent animals to contribute heavily, so the rate of coancestry is not too high (∼1% per generation). However, they could use more rotation of rams between flocks to reduce the rate of inbreeding.",

The age of ewes at first service averaged 615.6±8.2 days and was not significantly affected by the year and season of birth of the ewes. The ewes born during spring season had comparatively low (613.6±7.9 days) age at first service than autumn born (617.5±9.8 days). The type of birth did not significantly influence age at first service. The least squares mean for the weight at first service was 42.10±0.24 kg and was significantly (P<0.01) influenced by the ewe's year and season of birth. The spring-born ewes were heavier (42.3±0.3 kg) at first service than autumn-born ewes (41.9±0.3 kg). The weight at first service was also significantly affected by the age at first service. The type of birth did not significantly influence weight at first service. The number of services per conception averaged 1.29±0.03 and varied significantly (P<0.01) between seasons.

The effects of years and weight at service on the number of services per conception were non-significant. The number of services per conception significantly increased with advancing age. Mean gestation period was 152.31±0.08 days and it was significantly affected by the years and seasons of lambing and the age of the ewe at lambing.

This approach is relevant to widely differing scenarios involving animals, plants, and microbes. For the family membership scenario, SNP markers are genotyped for the contributing families' parents, and quantitatively genotyped to estimate allele frequencies within the mixed-family pooled tissue. Results are used to infer proportional contributions of the different families to the pool. Different computational strategies were tested for bias and sampling error. A correlation of 99% between estimated and true genetic contributions was achieved using 20 (50) randomly chosen SNPs at a standard error of allele frequency estimates of 0.01 (0.02). Optimal grouping of families and choice of markers further increases performance markedly. Trait means and distributions of families can be quite accurately estimated by tissue sampling across the range of trait values.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated how intensively manipulated grass/clover silage (finer structure than chopped silage) fed in total mixed ration (TMR), influenced feed consumption, total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) and pig behaviour. Ten Yorkshire x Hampshire (YH) pigs were included in a digestibility experiment and 64 YH pigs in a behaviour experiment. Pigs received TMR with 20% dry matter inclusion of either intensively manipulated (SI) or chopped silage (SC). Behaviour was registered with instantaneous and continuous sampling. SI pigs consumed more silage (p = 0.001) and spent more time eating from the through (p < 0.01), however no significant difference in TTAD was found (p > 0.05). Less social interactions prior to feeding (p = 0.029) and less rooting after feeding (p < 0.05) were found among SI pigs, indicating SI pigs being more satisfied for a longer time after feeding. We conclude that TMR with intensively manipulated silage benefits feed consumption and increases the opportunities for pigs perform feed-related behaviours.",

Except for some differences in the heritability for feed conversion ratio, the heritability estimates were remarkably similar using One-step PCA or MUV. The genetic correlations obtained using One-Step PCA were more reliable due to their lower standard errors compared to those obtained using MUV. The one-step PCA had better fit than MUV and could reduce the time computing due to the reduction of the additive genetic matrix.",

The old breed group preferred semi-natural pastures, while the modern breed preferred overgrown semi-natural meadows, intermediate fen, intermediate wooded fen, and grass-rich sub-alpine birch woodland. Both breeds spent most time grazing grasses, but the modern breed showed a higher frequency of grasses and Vaccinium myrtillus in its diet, while the old breed showed a higher frequency of bushes and trees. The pilot study shows some trends supplementing and strengthening earlier results on how modern and traditional cattle breeds are differing in their impact on vegetation based on their use of space and their different diets.",

Half of the group walked outdoors 3 km/day from May through October and 400-800 m/day from November through April. From July 1986 the distance walked in the summer period was 2 km daily.Daily exercise did not significantly affect voluntary DM intake, the overall energy consumption or production of milk, ECM, fat or protein. The efficiency of milk energy and protein production did not differ between the treatments in lactations 2-4. Mean energy efficiency in these lactations was 5.6 MJ/kg ECM and mean protein efficiency 1213 g AAT/kg protein. However, in lactation 1 and at restricted feeding, milk energy and protein production was significantly less efficient for exercised cows than for non-exercised cows. The difference was 0.39±0.12 MJ/kg ECM (p<0.01) and 132 ± 28 g AAT/kg protein (p<0.001). The discrepancy between the Swedish standard for ME in milk production above maintenance, 5.0 MJ/kg ECM, and the results obtained in this and other recent studies are discussed.Concentrations of serum free fatty acids and plasma glucose were measured once a week in lactation weeks 1-8. No significant differences between the treatment groups were observed. Feeding was ad lib. in lactation weeks 4-12.It was noticed that the cows never lay down in the exercise area, which was covered with sand and soil. Behavioural disturbance in the form of tongue rolling was not influenced by exercise.",

The experiment comprised 40 growing-finishing pigs from 10 litters with an average initial weight of 23.4 kg and average final weight of 104.1 kg. The experiment consisted of a growing period from week 0 to 7 and a finishing period from week 8 to slaughter. During the growing, finishing and overall periods, the high-fat diet gave a significantly higher average daily gain (ADG) and better feed efficiency as kg feed per kg of weight gain (F/G) compared with a low-fat diet (1.5% added fat). Overall, the high-fat diet also gave higher ADG, lower total feed intake, better feed/gain and a shorter time to market of 6.3 days (P<0.01), compared with the low-fat diet. There were no significant differences between diets for P2 backfat thickness, lean percentage (GP2Q), carcass meatiness or meat area in cutlet, but the high-fat diets tended to reduce the fat area in the cutlet. Carcass quality determined by the primal cut method, however, revealed a significantly lower lean percentage and a significantly higher fat percentage of pigs fed with high-fat diets. In conclusion, the use of high-fat diets improved growth performance with only minor negative effects on carcass quality. Thus, the addition of 10% rendered fat to diets had a positive effect on growth performance, but led to a slight increase in the fat content of the carcass.",

The effects of inbreeding level on milk, fat and protein yields in each of the first three lactations were estimated by including inbreeding level in the multitrait animal model currently used for breeding value estimation of the breed. A large proportion (58.6%) of the cows with production records were inbred. Negative effects were detected, corresponding to a reduction of 0.22–0.39% of mean production per 1% increase in inbreeding.

During the first 6 weeks of lactation, the dam lost around 15% (169 g) of the body weight at parturition, the main part, 10% (112 g), during the last 2 weeks. Older dams lost more weight than yearling dams, especially during the late part of the lactation period. Dams fed ad libitum had a higher body weight during the last part of the lactation period.

Inbreeding was achieved by repeated sire-daughter matings for three generations. In addition, \"contrast matings\" in the form of inbred dams carrying non-inbred litters and vice versa, reduced the colinearity between inbreeding of dam and inbreeding of litter. Average inbreeding coefficients were: dams, 16% (range 0–41%), litters, 24% (range 0–53%) and sires, 9% (range 0–41%). Inbreeding of sire had no significant effects. The total number of pups born per mated vixen declined significantly by 0.71 pups per 10% increased inbreeding of the dam (P=0.01). Litter inbreeding caused a significant reduction of 0.47 pups per 10% increase in inbreeding (P=0.05). Maternal inbreeding did not affect ovulation rate, but caused increased loss of ova or early embryos before implantation. Litter inbreeding caused increased mortality in the post-implantation period and during the first three days after parturition. Litter size shortly after parturition declined at a rate of 0.41 pups per 10% increase in litter inbreeding (P=0.02). Litter size at weaning was not affected by inbreeding. This suggests that genes affecting prenatal and early postnatal survival exhibit a dominance effect. Key Words: Fox Alopex lagopus litter sizeprenatal motalityembryonic deathinbreeding depression",

The bags were preincubated in a pepsin-HCI solution, unserted into the duodenum of dairy cows and recovered from the terminal ileum or from the faeces. The digestibility in the lower gut was also estimated. The N disappearance was higher in bags recovered from faeces than from the ileum for most of the feeds tested; however differences were significant only in pea and barley straw. The disappearance of Kjeldahl N (NK) underestimated true N digestibility (15N) at both recovery sites. NK digestibility measured using bags recovered from the faeces generally agreed with estimates of 15N digestibility measured using bags recovered from the ileum. It is concluded that the mobile bag technique provides a true measure of intestinal nitrogen digestion.",

CB chickens had heavier live weights, grew more rapidly and had heavier carcass components at slaughter under intensive conditions, but lost more weight under extensive conditions than the other two breeds. Intensive birds showed a higher degree of maturity than extensively reared birds. Males expressed their growth capacity much less than females under extensive conditions. Size scaling narrowed the gap between the performance of CB chickens and other genotypes but the specific genetic effect still remained.

Using the monthly average daily water loss as an indicator, swimming activity showed a clear annual variation over 4 years and was positively correlated with average monthly temperature. With regard to swimming activity, a large individual variation existed: average water loss varied from 10 ml to nearly 4 litres per day, with those in large cage units having the greatest water loss. The video-recordings confirmed this variation: the number of swims ranged from zero to 177 during 24 h and there was an indication of more swimming bouts in the mink in the large cage units. The duration of swims varied from 2 to 55 s per bout. The relationship between swimming and general activity is discussed, along with the importance of water for swimming as a means of thermoregulation.",

The dataset included 48,946 Dala lambs and 38,299 Spæl lambs. The breed by environment interaction affected lamb autumn weights, and though Dala lambs were always heavier, the difference was substantially smaller at lower than at higher production levels: 1 kg increase in production level was related to Dala lambs' weights increasing 0.09 kg more than the Spæl lambs' weights.

During four consecutive weeks maize was harvested and ensiled for 60 days in vacuum-sealed laboratory silos. The content of DM in silage increased (p<0.001), whereas acetate and ethanol decreased (p<0.01) with later time of harvest. Concentrations of methanol and propanol were generally <1 g/kg DM and the content of 2-butanol <0.03 g/kg DM. The content of D-glucose was lower (p=0.03) in silage harvested the second week compared with the other harvest times (40.9 vs. 66–69 g/kg DM). Overall, silage pH was negatively correlated with L-lactate (r=−0.93). Drying increased pH, butyrate and valerate, although the numerical effect was small. A major portion of acetate was lost in drying, and the D-glucose content was reduced by approximately 45% after drying. Alcohols and esters were completely lost in drying. We conclude that ensiling of pre-mature maize does not lead to extensive alcohol fermentation in laboratory silos following 60 days of ensiling, and that dry matter correction based on fermentation products determined in dry samples may be erroneous due to inability to predict wet sample content from samples dried at 60°C.",

In this experiment six calves suckled their dams twice a day for five weeks then once a day for three weeks (DAM8). Six calves (DAM5) suckled during five weeks in the same way as calves in DAM8 and were then abruptly weaned. Six calves (TEAT8) were fed the same amount of milk from teat buckets as DAM8. Consumption of dry feed by all calves was low at the age of five weeks. Consequently, the calves abruptly weaned at the age of five weeks lost weight after weaning. Nursing times were quite similar (about 20 min) during the entire suckling period. However, reducing suckling from twice a day to once a day at the age of five weeks increased the frequency of teat changing. In conclusion, total weaning at the age of five weeks from high milk allowance seems not recommendable. Five weeks of twice a day suckling followed by three weeks of once a day suckling is likely to reduce the decline in energy intake and growth following weaning.",

A general mixed linear model was used for the analysis. Birth weight affected summer mortality non-proportionally: an increase in weight from very small towards the breed mean strongly deflated mortality risk; weigh increase above breed means had little effect. Male lambs had a higher mortality than females, and lambs born by 12-months-old dams were in greater risk than those having older dams. Increasing litter size resulted in increased mortality.

    "abstract": "Abstract In-line detection of mastitis using frequent milk sampling was studied in 241 cows in a Danish research herd. Somatic cell scores obtained at a daily basis were analyzed using a mixture of four time-series models. Probabilities were assigned to each model for the observations to belong to a normal “steady-state” development, change in “level”, change of “slope” or “outlier”. Mastitis was indicated from the sum of probabilities for the “level” and “slope” models. Time-series models were based on the Kalman filter. Reference data was obtained from veterinary assessment of health status combined with bacteriological findings. At a sensitivity of 90% the corresponding specificity was 68%, which increased to 83% using a one-step back smoothing. It is concluded that mixture models based on Kalman filters are efficient in handling in-line sensor data for detection of mastitis and may be useful for similar applications to decision support systems.

Lambs fed supplements had higher final body weight (BW), total gain, average daily gain (ADG), total dry matter intake (DMI), total tract digestion, and carcass dressing than lambs in control treatment. Final BW, total gain, ADG, total DMI, feed conversion, and total tract digestion were improved linearly as protein level in concentrate increased. Meat of lambs fed supplements was lighter, redder, and less yellow than meat of lambs in control treatment. It is concluded that supplementation improved ADG, feed conversion, carcass dressing, and meat color. Keywords: Hair lambsprotein levelstargrasssupplementation",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract This paper presents an assessment of atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and associated land use for the production of milk, beef, grain and potatoes. It compares the less intensive (i.e. organic) farming system with the more intensive (i.e. conventional) food production system. The emission sources, trade-offs with land and potential for reduction of GHG emissions were analysed. The sources for farm accounts data on inputs and outputs are representative farm types constructed from data from the Norwegian Farm Accountancy Data Network. The analysis was carried out with life cycle assessment, including processes from manufacturing of inputs to farms, and on-farm production up to the farm gate. The results show that it is worthwhile considering a greater proportion of food energy from vegetable rather than from animal products, analysing grass-based meat production in more detail and reducing mineral fertilizer use.

The polymorphism in the IGF1R gene was analyzed by a PCR-RFLP method using the restriction enzymes SacII. Two different alleles of the IGF1R gene were identified. The statistical analysis in first parity showed that the BB genotype was superior and the differences were highly significant (p≤0.01). Later parities sows with the BB genotype still had the largest litter size compared to AB and AA sows, but the difference was statistically not significant. The preliminary study suggests a possibility of using the IGF1R gene polymorphisms to improvement of litter size of sows.",

We studied the regional differences in production environment, management and selection, using the information on (1) the interviews of the managers of the reindeer herding cooperatives and (2) the official statistics on the cooperatives. In the northernmost region, there are larger herds, higher animal density and less need for extra feeding. Predation causes losses in the east and restricts the full utilization of the selection potential. Selection and the optimization of herd composition are considered in all the regions as the most important herding operations. The selection criteria are similar in the regions. In conclusion, the guidelines for coordinated selection as an integrated part of management may be common across the regions.",

Direct field observations lasted 1.5–2.5 h per session between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm, adding up to an observation time of 74 h in the first and 134 h in the second year. Behaviour, nearest neighbour identity and distance were recorded individually every 15 min by point sampling. Rank order remained very stable between years (τb = 0.91; P < 0.01). All mares showed preferences for the proximity of primarily one specific group member. K-coefficients of synchronization, i.e. non-random synchronization, were higher in the second year of observation (2010: κ = 0.22; 2011: κ = 0.54; t = 2.69; P = 0.007). Among the different parameters evaluated, the Kappa coefficient proved to be most reliable for assessment of synchronization at the group level, because it is not inherently affected by time budgets. A high degree of behavioural synchronization might be the basis of stable group cohesion. Preferences between individuals should be considered for re-groupings in managed horse groups.",

Matings between closely related animals were common. Pedigree completeness was satisfactory and inbreeding coefficient was high, 11.71% for lambs born in 2012. Relatively high values of potential and realized coancestries within flocks showed the importance of keeping more than one ram. The genetic conservation index and average relatedness coefficient, and their comparison between regions was helpful in considering management options.

VDMI was recorded in fifteen bulls, steers and heifers, respectively, fed a complete diet ad libitum. The diet was based on chopped straw formulated to secure physical regulation of feed intake. Total random variation of recorded VDMI corresponded to a coefficient of variation (CV) of 24.6%. Two thirds of this variation was due to random day to day variation in VDMI. Random variation between weeks, random variation between animals and residual random variation corresponded to a CV of 3.6, 8.0 and 10.0%, respectively, and they explained 2.5, 12.2 and 18.8% of the total random variation. In the present experiment VDMI was increased by 0.32% per hour increase in day length.

    "abstract": "Abstract In a joint Nordic project, four experiments with a total of 880 growing pigs following the same outline were conducted in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. In three of these experiments the animals were fed individually. Five dietary treatments were investigated with respect to effects on performance, carcass composition and leg condition by entire or partial dissection. The treatments were: (1) restricted standard feeding as a reference in all experiments; (2) ad libitum feeding with protein (amino acid) concentrations according to recommended allowances (RA); (3) as in (2) but RA increased by 10% (RA + 10%); (4) as in (2) but RA lowered by 10% (RA - 10%), or (5) the most common restricted feeding scale recommended in the individual countries, thus being different from experiment to experiment. Compared with the restricted standard feeding, for which daily feed intake and daily weight gain in the weight range 23–100 kg averaged 2.07 kg and 750 g, respectively (rel. value 100), the corresponding mean values for the ad libitum fed animals were 119 and 120, respectively (P < 0.001). Ad libitum compared with restricted feeding lowered carcass meat percentage by 1.5 percentage units (P < 0.05–0.01). Feeding regimen did not affect leg condition. In the weight range 23–60 kg, treatment RA - 10% resulted in a slight decrease in performance and also in a slightly lowered carcass quality at 100 kg. On restricted feeding, females and castrated males performed equally, but carcass meat percentage of the former exceeded that of the latter by 2.3 percentage units (P < 0.001). Daily feed intake and weight gain of ad libitum fed castrated males exceeded the values of females by 11% and 9%, respectively (P < 0.001). Sex did not affect feed efficiency of ad libitum fed animals. Castrated males showed a poorer hind leg condition than females (P < 0.01). Carcass meat percentage was higher in restrictedly fed than in ad libitum fed animals. The difference was 0.7 and 1.8 percentage units for females and castrated males, respectively. A main conclusion is that the daily feed intake is a major factor in the control of the development of the animals and also for the extent of fat deposition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Variance components and breeding values were calculated for litter size in three breeds of sheep, using non-linear (GFCAT) and linear (REML, BLUP) models. GFCAT heritabilities ranged from 0.09 to 0.27, with heritabilities on the outward scale which were fairly similar to the REML estimates. REML heritabilities and repeatabilities ranged from 0.00 to 0.10 and from 0.00 to 0.20, respectively. Correlations between breeding values of rams obtained by BLUP and GFCAT ranged from 0.91 to 1.00. Correlations between breeding values of daughters and rams estimated by the two methods were fairly consistent within breed. It was concluded that rams could and should be evaluated by the more justified GFCAT method, and because of the similarity between results of the two types of methods that ewes should be evaluated by BLUP until non-linear methods can be performed with an animal model.",

The digestibility of rumen undegraded protein after 24 h rumen incubation varied from 0 to 46% for grasses, from 2 to 42% for legumes, and was zero for leucaena. The results showed a generally low intestinal digestibility of rumen undegraded protein, and indicate that long retention time in the rumen is necessary to obtain maximum utilization of the protein in these feeds. The hypothesis that feeds contain a fraction which is both undegradable in the rumen and indigestible in the intestine, and that this fraction can be estimated by the mobile nylon bag technique from the intact protein, was not valid for the tropical forages tested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A total of 44 dairy cows of the Swedish Red and White dual-purpose breed were divided into 4 equal groups. Two groups were fed concentrate containing approximately 19% crude protein (high level), while two groups were fed concentrate containing 14.3% crude protein (low level). The differences were obtained by mixing either 25 or 8% 00-rapeseed meal into a basic grain-dominated mixture. Within each protein level, one half of the cows were allotted untreated rapeseed meal and the other half heat-treated rapeseed meal. The heat treatment decreased the effective protein degradability of the rapeseed meal by 20 units from 72 to 52%. The experiment was commenced as a continuous experiment, where weeks 1–3 of the lactation were a preliminary period in which all cows received the same feeding. The experimental period covered lactation weeks 4–20. When the experiment was analysed, the results from the preliminary period were used as covariates. Significant treatment effects were reached both for level and degradability. This was mainly due to a significantly lower milk and protein production on the treatment URM - low protein level. This treatment also reached a significantly lower feed energy utilization and a higher fat percentage in milk. It was concluded that evaluating the protein according to the new Nordic AAT/PBV system correlated better to milk production than did crude protein or digestible crude protein. By using the AAT-PBV system it was possible to minimize the crude protein content in the concentrate without impairing milk production. A general conclusion is that there are benefits in the form of higher milk production and better feed utilization from decreasing protein degradability in rapeseed meal.",

The mean count of mature (telogen) underfur hairs per bundle differed slightly between the groups on 1 December but the mean total hair counts (anagen and telogen hairs) were similar.

The estimation was done by use of models, which were based on detailed work studies carried out among 13 practical stockbreeders. The efficiency of the different housing systems depended on the size of herd. For herd sizes over 100 cows, the total labour requirement was between 27 and 31% lower in loose housing systems than in tie-stall housing systems. However, when the herd sizes were reduced to fewer than 70 dairy cows, the savings obtained on the tasks feeding and cleaning in loose housing systems were counterbalanced by a higher labour requirement on milking.",

The design criteria of space allowance, feeding space, pen depth and quality of the floor were integrated into a TGI-40 protocol and related to the incidence of early losses. Additionally, claws of the bulls were collected after slaughtering and examined for pathological information. Slatted floor pens were characterised by a low space allowance and a low pen depth. The dimensions of pens with deep litter and two area straw yard were clearly greater but showed a wide and overlapping variation in the different design criteria. The claws of animals from deep litter and two area straw yard were in a worse condition than the claws of animals from completely slatted floors. Early and total animal losses were greater in pens with slatted floors than in litter systems. Taking all the farms into account, it could be seen that the incidence of early losses was negatively correlated with space allowance (r = -0.31; P < 0.01 ) and quality of the floor (r = -0.27; P < 0.05 ). The integration of different design criteria into a TGI-40 protocol did not improve their meaningfulness in relation to early losses. The results indicate that the meaningfulness of design criteria in relation to early losses of fattening losses is low.",

Records from Landrace (L; 39,130), Yorkshire (Y; 33,737), and Hampshire (H; 17,832) pigs born between 1997 and 2001 from the Swedish breeding organization Quality Genetics databank were available. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied. Two statistical models were used. The first model applied for all traits, included the random effect of herd-birth year-birth month combination, the litter environmental effects, and the direct genetic effects. The second model applied only for DG0-UT and BF, and included also the maternal genetic effects. Based on the first single-trait model, estimates of direct heritability (h2) were 0.12, 0.09, and 0.43 for DG0-12; 0.16, 0.22, and 0.41 for DG12-UT; 0.18, 0.24, and 0.28 for DG0-UT; and 0.37, 0.42, and 0.43 for BF in the L, Y, and H breeds respectively. Estimates of litter environmental effects ranged from 0.05 to 0.17. Based on the second single-trait model, the maternal genetic effects were 0.03, 0.05, and 0.09 for DG0-UT, and 0.02, 0.01, and 0.04 for BF. Estimates of direct h2 from the second model were lower and ranged from 0.14 to 0.42 for all traits across breeds. Moderate-low genetic correlation between DG0-12 and DG12-UT (−0.25 to 0.40) and high correlation between DG12-UT and DG0-UT (0.84 to 0.96) were noted in all three breeds together with less maternal influence on traits expressed late in life. This indicates the possibility to treat early growth rate as a maternal trait, and late or overall growth rate as a direct trait in the breeding evaluation.",

The stochastic model used was dynamic, and it simulated production, reproduction and health in a dairy herd. Finland and Norway had the highest economic values for milk production, whereas Denmark and Sweden had lower values, assuming a fixed number of cows. Norway had the highest absolute economic values for stillbirth, retained placenta, laminitis, feed intake capacity, milking speed and daily gain. Denmark had the highest absolute economic value for milk fever and calving ease. Finland had the highest economic value for conception rate. Sweden had the lowest economic value for body weight but the highest for temperament. In most cases the differences in economic values were less than two-fold, with greater than two-fold differences for stillbirth (Sweden vs. Finland and Norway), retained placenta (Sweden vs. Norway), laminitis (Sweden vs. Denmark and Norway) and days from calving to first heat (Sweden vs. Finland). The consideration of milk quota, for most traits, caused minor (less than two-fold) changes in economic values. The differences in economic values, for most of the traits, were slight and do not seem to be a hindrance towards a closer cooperation within a joint breeding programme for the Nordic countries.",

There was no interaction between the effects of cage design and of dietary treatment on laying performance. Hens kept in FCs consumed less feed than hens in CCs (p<0.05). After the first feeding phase, hens housed in FCs produced fewer eggs (p<0.01) than hens in CCs. No differences in the feed conversion ratio were found between the housing systems. Hens on the low protein diet laid smaller eggs than hens on the high protein diet (p<0.001). No effect of dietary protein on laying rate was found.

In experiment 1 the crop was harvested when the peas were at the flat pod (cut 1) or full pod (cut 2) stage. At the first cut half of the forage was wilted and half was acid-treated with a 2:1 mixture of formic and propionic acid. At the second cut all of the forage was acid-treated. Voluntary intake was highest for the cut 2 silage. In experiment 2 the crop was harvested when the peas were at the flat pod (cut 1), pod fill (cut 2) or full pod (cut 3) stage. The crop was pre-wilted overnight and then acid-treated. Voluntary intake was highest for the cut 3 silage, although the in vivo apparent digestibility was lowest. Milk and protein yield increased with crop maturity. It was concluded that pre-wilting and acid treatment produces good quality, palatable pea-oat bi-crop silage. In terms of feed intake and milk production, the optimal time of harvest was when peas were at the pod fill stage and the oats were in the late milk to early dough stage.",

Half of the calves in each pen were relocated to an identical but strange room. Serial blood samples were taken 24 h prior to and 24 h following relocation at 20-min intervals and were assayed for GH and cortisol. Both of the hormones had a clear ultradian pulsatile variation. We detected (mean±/se) 4.6±/0.6 GH pulses/24 h. GH concentrations peaked four times during the day and pulses were higher in daytime. Cortisol peaked 5.8±0.6 times/24 h. Cortisol concentrations were highest at feeding. No overall effects of flooring or relocation were found but calves on concrete floors had greater cortisol concentrations than on rubber mats, especially during the night.

We review recent estimates, showing there is substantial genetic variation in levels of environmental and phenotypic variation. We review evolutionary forces that can affect the level of environmental variation, and find that most models lead to a predicted reduction. We thus argue that its maintenance is a consequence of factors such as the intrinsic cost of homogeneity, phenotypic plasticity to variable environments, or mutants that increase variance. We show how to construct a selection index to predict the magnitude of changes in variance as a result of artificial selection, and consider the opportunities for artificial selection to increase uniformity.",

Two levels of concentrate supplementation; restricted (0.4 kg concentrate/lamb/day) or ad libitum, two breed types; Norwegian White lamb or Nor-X and two sex types; ram or ewe lambs, were investigated. In experiment I, a 2×2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments (level of supplementation, sex, and breed) was imposed whereas a 2×2 arrangement of treatments (level of supplementation and breeds) was studied in Experiment II. Each of the two experiments lasted for four weeks. Lambs on ad libitum access to concentrate grew at 231 g d–1 and 125 g d–1 faster than those on restricted access in Experiment I and II, respectively. Moreover, ram lambs grew at 64 g d–1 faster than ewe lambs. Lambs on ad libitum access to concentrate had about 5 kg heavier carcasses than that on restricted access. Ewe and ram lambs on ad libitum allowance to concentrate had 4.2 kg and 5.6 kg, respectively, higher carcass weight than those on restricted allowance. The two levels of concentrate supplementation had limited effects on the meat sensory qualities. Meat taste intensity increased with level of concentrate supplementation. Difference in meat tenderness between ram and ewe lambs was only evidenced on ad libitum concentrate feeding. Irrespective of stage of growth (Experiment I vs. II) and concentrate supplementation level, Nor-X lambs were superior to Norwegian White lambs with respect to carcass conformation scores. Based on results from sensory assessments of meat, ram lambs should be slaughtered before October to avoid off-flavour on meat.",

Relative and absolute genetic gains obtained from VIO and VGO were used for comparison between the schemes. Results showed that village observations significantly improved genetic gains compared to the scheme without birds tested in the village. The improvement was only slightly larger with individual observations than with group observations.

Their closest relatives are Border Leicester, Galway, and Texel. Apart from gene flow between native Danish breeds, Texel admixture was most dominant. For Danish Landrace sheep, a population split into two genetically distinct sub-populations was detected. Compared to other livestock species, genomic inbreeding was moderate.

Prediction performance was evaluated for a test set including carcasses graded by Norwegian classifiers, and a separate test set for carcasses graded by international classifiers. The precision for conformation was high (Pearson correlation ≥ 0.94) for both test sets, but the precision for fat cover was lower (Pearson correlation range 0.30–0.91). High correlation for conformation, together with low bias estimates, provides indication that the objective method is equipped to replace the previous human classifier system for conformation in Norway.",

Two different sizes of woodchips (small: 2.5 cm and large: 5.0 cm) were tested in combination, both with or without Sphagnum peat. Ten groups of seven adult, pregnant ewes of the Norwegian White breed were randomly allotted to pens containing one of the bedding mixtures. Resting behaviour, animal cleanliness and the temperature development in the bedding were measured over four months. The woodchip size and peat supplement did not affect resting behaviour, although ewes housed on straw bedding were cleaner than those kept on woodchip-based bedding. The fewer the days since the addition of fresh litter substrate, the cleaner the animals. In conclusion, the welfare of sheep was acceptable when housed on woodchip-based bedding, and generally good when housed on straw bedding.

The studied traits were pelt quality, pelt size, pelt color clarity, litter size, pregnancy (barren or non-barren), and felicity (includes both aborting and females losing all pups before pups are 3 weeks). Marginal economic values of traits were estimated by the numeric approximation of the partial derivate of the profit function with respect to those traits. Economic weights of traits were obtained by multiplying the marginal economic values by genetic standard deviations. Felicity, pregnancy, and litter size had the highest economic weights (26.80, 19.74, and 18.36 EUR/σa, respectively). Economic weights of pelt quality, length, and color clarity were 7.17, 5.24, and 0.33 EUR/σa, respectively. Changes in production environment (feed and price, improvement in fertility) had only minor effect on relative economic weights. Generally, an unfavorable change in environmental variables increases the relative weight of pelt quality.",

In this review, we evaluate the effect of breed, sex, age, feeding, growth rate, slaughter method and aging on beef flavor. A common determinator for these factors is their influence on intramuscular fat (IMF) where more IMF increase the overall flavor liking. Feeding can, however, affect the flavor of beef beyond that of the amount of IMF. In several studies, pasture or pasture-based silage lead to a beef flavor characterized as fishy, gamey and grassy in contrast to concentrate-fed beef cattle. A geographical difference in flavor preferences of high-quality beef exists, most clearly illustrated among US consumers who prefer beef from concentrate-fed cattle, whereas European consumers tend to prefer beef from cattle fed a mixed diet on pasture and concentrate.",

Bacterial counts from faeces from the ewes fed with supplement which contained SW meal throughout the entire indoor winter period had significantly lower lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts (P ≈ .05). The screening of extracts from red and brown SWs showed that a number of the organic extracts had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the two Enterococcus sp. isolates. The results indicate that Ascophyllum nodosum supplementation reduces LAB counts in the ewes and the lambs, and that extracts from this SW have an inhibitory effect on the growth of Enterococcus sp. isolates.",

Information for 2 years regarding weather, milk production, and time for voluntarily passing a gate between the barn and pasture of cows milked with an automatic milking system was studied. When the THI exceeded 72 during the day, more cows spent time on pasture compared to when the THI was less than 72 (27.0% vs. 19.2% of cows on pasture, respectively). However, the time of day influenced the proportion of cows on pasture, and when the THI exceeded 72, more cows were on pasture at night and less during the afternoon compared to days when the THI was less than 72. In conclusion, even under Swedish conditions, THI might have an effect on cows’ behaviour. However, when the cows have free access to roughage and pasture, an increased THI does not affect milk production.",

Change-over designs were used during experiments 1 and 2 while a continuous design with a covariate period was used in experiment 3. The effect of fouling on intake at a herbage allowance of 30 kg dry matter (DM) per cow and day was studied by comparing herbage intake on clean, grass-dominated pastures (treatment CG), with herbage intake on fouled grass-dominated pastures (treatment FG), in experiments 1-3. In experiment 2, a third treatment was included, consisting of grazing a clean clover-grass ley (treatment CC). Pastures on treatment CG were cut and those on FG were grazed and then immediately topped at the same times throughout the grazing season until the start of the experiment. In experiment 2, the grazing area of treatment CC was the regrowth after an early season harvest. The herbage intake on treatment FG was 13.0, 13.8 and 14.2 kg organic matter (OM) per cow and day in experiments 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while corresponding intake values for treatment CG were 13.7, 15.5 and 14.8 kg (OM). In experiment 2, the herbage intake of cows on treatment CC was 15.1 kg OM. The increases in intake observed on clean pastures were statistically significant (p < 0.01) in experiments 1 and 2 but not in experiment 3. Herbage intake was approximately 5-10% higher when animals were offered clean pasture compared with fouled. Sequential estimations of areas fouled were also made in experiments 2 and 3. Dung pat sizes in 15-25% of the total experimental area were measured. The area fould per cow and day increased from an average of 0.7 m2 during the first rotation to 1.8 m2 during later rotations. In a similar manner, the proportion of the paddock covered by dung increased from approximately 0.7% after the first rotation to 1.2% after later rotations, although the average stocking density was higher at the first rotation compared with later rotations: 92 and 77 cows per ha, respectively. Topping of pastures in experimental paddocks increased the fouled area considerably and, at the start of the experiment in late August, approximately 6% of the total experimental area had been covered by dung after three rotations.",

RSM-1 and RSM-2 originated from black-seeded rapeseed varieties (Brassica campestris) and RSM-3 and RSM-4 from a variety with yellowish-coloured seeds. Heat-moisture treatment of RSM effectively reduced the content of glucosinolates and was favourable for voluntary grass silage intake. The improved animal performance could not be explained solely by the reduced rumen degradability and thereby increased supply of rumen-undegraded feed protein to the intestine. Rather, the enhanced liveweight gain of bulls on 00-RSM supplements was closely related to increased grass silage intake and thereby to increased energy intake. Differences in fatty acid composition in subcutaneous and m. longissimus dorsi fat were observed between the various RSM feeding groups.",

The annual race records were summarized to provide early career records for two- to five-year-old Standardbred trotters (n=3080) and three- to six-year-old Finnhorse trotters (n=2638). The majority (85.7%) of Standardbred trotters started racing at the age of three or four years. Most Finnhorse trotters (76.0%) had their first race as four-of five-year-olds. The most common SACL-combination was the three- to five-year-old season in Standardbred trotters and four- to six-year-old season in Finnhorse trotters, respectively. A statistically significant interaction between the SACL-combination and sex was observed for best career time. Generally, horses starting their racing career young and racing during several consecutive years were superior to other horses in both breeds. Standardbred trotters racing through three to five years of age had career times 5.6, 7.5 and 6.3 seconds better on an average than horses racing only as three-, four- or five-year-olds, respectively. In Finnhorses the differences between the SACL combinations pointed in the same direction and were even greater. Key Words: horseenvironmental factorsracehorsetrotting",

The proposed system is based on (i) an identification of those organic nutrient fractions that, according to their absorption, metabolism and utilization, are relevant for determining the value of the feed, and (ii) biochemically‐based calculations of the potential physiological value of these fractions. The system is further based on a flexible stepwise evaluation in which the fundamental properties of the feed are related to its utilization in actual situations. Step 1 is characterized by single feedstuffs according to the digestible amounts of those nutrient fractions which are relevant for feed formulation, i.e. essential amino acids, other N‐compounds, ileal digestible carbohydrates, fermentable carbohydrates, fatty acids and other lipid compounds. Step 2 involves complete diets with three complementary properties, measured according to their potential value for the pig: protein value (i.e. amount of digestible ideal protein), “fat value”; (i.e. amount of digestible triacylglycerols) and the “complemental energy value”; (i.e. potential metabolic energy generated directly from the residual digestible nutrient fractions). Step 3 predicts the production value, either a standardized value determined by standard mathematical equations, or the actual value determined by the use of computerized pig models.",

The calves were switched between pens twice, and in each case the 5 day observation period was repeated. In all three phases all calves spent significantly more time ( P <0.01) lying on the wooden floor: on average 656 min day -1 compared with 294 min day -1 on the synthetic floor. The time spent in the standing/walking position on both floors, occurrence of slip incidents and self-maintenance behaviour did not differ significantly between floors. The observations on use of the pen floor for lying and for standing/walking in combination with feeding, plus observations on fouling of the floors with excreta suggest that future pen design could be functionally divided into lying and walking/eating areas.

The growth and hepatic lipids (analysed by a thin-layer chromatography- flame ionization detection analyser) and fatty acid composition (analysed by gas-liquid chromatography) were studied. The pattern of weight gain of the mink fed the beef pork diet differed from that of the other mink. These kits reached high but delayed weight maxima compared with the other mink but then during November they lost weight rapidly. In liver, both the capelin oil- and linseed oil-fed mink had large concentrations of total lipids and triacylglycerols. The mink fed capelin oil were significantly heavier. The fatty acid analyses of hepatic total lipids and phospholipids revealed that the f -linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) of linseed oil was not efficiently metabolized to longer chain and more unsaturated fatty acids important for cellular membranes. It is discussed that 18:3 n-3 may not be as valuable for growing mink kits as the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the fish oils. Keywords: Fish DietLinseed OilLiverNutritionPhospholipidsPufa",

The cows were divided in two groups and were studied in a change-over experiment in which each group was submitted to each treatment twice.

The effects of individual dominance value (DV), age, eating rate and energy requirements were recorded on ingestive behaviour. The cows on treatment 4c visited the feeding stations more often (106% more visits and 76% more meals) and shortened their feeding times by 50%, resulting in higher consumption rates compared with treatment 1c. In addition, aggression increased, resulting in a greater number of displacements at feeding.

    "abstract": "In Denmark, organic feeding is typically based on homegrown feed with a high proportion of roughage. Which crop to grow and use as supplementary feed is investigated in this paper. In three experiments, barley (B) was compared with another type of supplementary feed: a concentrate mixture (C), grass pellets (G), or fodder beets (F). The concentrate mixture resulted in a higher (P=0.002) milk yield (25.9 vs. 23.7 kg), a tendency of a lower (P=0.07) fat content (4.08 vs. 4.25%), and a higher (P=0.006) ECM yield (25.7 vs. 24.1 kg) compared to feeding barley as supplement at the same energy level. Grass pellets resulted in a lower (P=0.01) milk fat content (3.74 vs. 4.07%), a tendency of a lower (P=0.12) protein content (3.14 vs. 3.23%), but no different milk or ECM yield compared to feeding barley as supplement at the same dry matter level. Fodder beet tended to decrease (P=0.12) the milk yield (20.7 vs. 22.0 kg), and the ECM yield (P=0.05) was lower (21.5 vs. 22.9 kg) whereas the composition of the milk was unaffected compared to the total mixed ration with barley.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal application of once-bred gilts for piglet and meat production outdoors could be a worthwhile alternative rearing form to normal commercial production. Compared with growing/finishing pigs, payment for sow carcasses is considerably reduced because of an assumed decrease in meat quality and processing properties. The purpose of this study was to compare maiden and once-bred gilts for carcass quality, and technological and sensory meat quality. The control group of 14 gilts (LW*L and LW*D) was reared indoors and slaughtered unmated at an average live weight of 145 kg. In contrast, 38 once-bred gilts of the same breeds were initially reared like the maiden control, inseminated and then housed outdoors from one month before farrowing until slaughter. Carcass traits, technological meat quality (pH, internal and surface reflectance, water holding capacity, commercial processing yield (total yield) and laboratory processing yield (Napole yield), WB shear force and chemical composition of M. longissimus dorsi were measured. Sensory meat quality (taste panel) of oven-baked M. longissimus dorsi and cured and smoked M. semimembranosus et adductor was investigated. Carcass quality traits such as higher lean meat content and lower backfat thickness were preferable with the once-bred gilts. For technological meat quality characteristics, once-bred gilts had lower thawing loss, Napole yield, dry matter and higher total work of WB shear force and intramuscular fat, compared to maiden gilts. In general, sensory meat quality was comparable between the two groups. In processed meat only, once-bred gilts had higher juiciness and salinity and unfavourable increased stringiness, compared to maiden gilts. Thus, once-bred gilts produce valuable carcasses and are suitable for an outdoor seasonal rearing system.",

The present work investigated that the addition of n − 3 LC PUFA to feed in combination with ALA would increase the LC PUFA in the meat. Two groups of reindeer were fed pellets containing either linseed cake or linseed cake combined with algae (Nannochloropsis oculata) for 6 weeks before slaughter. Dietary n − 6/n − 3 ratio had a distinct influence on meat fatty acid (FA) composition when comparing linseed and linseed algae-fed animals with animals fed a conventional diet. Increased dietary proportions of ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increased these FA in muscle and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid in the polar lipid fraction compared to the conventional-fed animals. We concluded that an increased proportion of dietary EPA might lead to an increased elongation towards DPA in muscle. Algae and linseed are possible additives to reindeer feed in order to assure a similar valuable FA composition as in pasturing animals.",

However, the continued use of soybeans as a protein source may reduce the contribution of quails to food and nutrition security. It is, therefore, prudent that alternative dietary proteins, with no direct food value for humans, be evaluated to allow for sustainable intensification of quails. One such protein source is canola meal, a by-product of oil extraction from canola seed. This review explores the potential of canola meal as a replacement for soybean meal in quail diets by presenting a comparative analysis of the composition and functional properties of the two proteins. A balanced assessment of in vivo responses to canola meal in quails and other avians is presented with the objective of enhancing the quail's contribution to food and nutrition security.",

Increasing concentration of WDDGS was achieved by replacing barley grain with WDDGS. Thirty-nine weaned crossbred lambs were completely randomized by weight and assigned to three dietary treatments (control, 200 g/kg WDDGS, and 400 g/kg WDDGS). Increasing WDDGS in the diet affected eating rate, total daily intake, and average daily gain. Total saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in subcutaneous fat were unaltered, but proportions of linolenic acid were increased.

The average duration of lambing was 18 min, and 65% of the sheep were lying down; 48.8% of the sheep tended their lambs 15–30 min before the first suckling, while 73% of lambs initiated contact with the mother through vocalisation 10 min after birth. The lambs' birth weight was 4 ± 0.6 kg, and they were weaned at 42 days with an average weight of 12.9 ± 2.2 kg. To conclude, the data gathered during the study can help us better comprehend the adaptive traits of sheep that belong to the Pantaneiro genetic group.",

We address this by mapping the frequency of four known mutations (200Q, 199 V, hal+, PHKG1) in heterogenous Norwegian and German pig populations (n = 136/61). Genotyping for mutations was done by PCR-RFLP analyses and Illumina chip genotyping. We found a high prevalence of pigs with at least one of the four tested mutations for Norwegian and German samples (60%, 77%). For Norwegian samples, we confirm known links of 200Q and PHKG1 with Hampshire and Duroc genetics, respectively. For Germany, we show that Piétrain pigs can still be heterozygous carriers of hal + . In all, our data points to a relatively high abundance of mutations that affect pork quality in both countries. The high prevalence of individual mutations may contribute to recent ham quality defects.",

Three cuts of tall fescue (TF) and meadow fescue (MF) were harvested with as similar chemical composition as possible, pre-wilted and ensiled separately in bales. Forty newly weaned intact bulls of Continental beef breeds were kept indoors and randomized to one of the two silages, complemented with 2.5–3.0 kg grain/day, and followed until slaughter. The two silages were offered simultaneously from the same cut during most of the finishing period. Bulls receiving TF had a higher silage dry matter intake than bulls offered MF (7.69 vs. 7.04 kg-d; P = 0.0026) but had lower carcass weight (370 vs. 380 kg; P = 0.0357). From this limited study it was concluded that replacing traditional MF silage with TF silage might compromise the carcass performance of finishing beef bulls.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of a change in day length and light intensity on the concentration of prolactin in milk and plasma, on milk production during the first two months of lactation, and on the daily variation in plasma concentrations of prolactin, melatonin, growth hormone, Cortisol and insulin 24–48 h after calving. The light programmes used were 9.5 L:14.5 D and 17.5 L:6.5 D. During 4–8 weeks before calving one group was on the long day programme (LL group) and the other on the short day programme (DL group) in both experiments. After calving, both groups were on the long day programme. Indoor light intensity was 150 lux at the eye level of the cows in both experiments. Outdoor light intensity during the summer was also included in the calculationsln the second experiment. In the first study, with 6 cows and 6 first calvers, the plasma concentration of prolactin increased significantly in the LL group but not in the DL group during 30-3 days before calving (b = 1.88±0.70 μg/l/d, p<0.01). During weeks 1–8 after calving there was a similar increase in the DL group (b plasma = 12.03 μg/l/w, p < 0.001 and b milk = 0.88±0.37 μg/l/w, p <0.05), but no significant change in the LL group. The first calvers of the LL group produced 10–12% more energy-corrected milk (3.14 MJ/kg) and kg milk fat than those of the DL group (p<0.05). No production traits of the cows were influenced by the light programmes (p>0.40), but both groups of cows were severely affected by illness after calving. Melatonin, growth hormone and Cortisol concentrations in plasma showed no significant daily variation and no effect of light programmes (p>0.45). There was no significant difference in the insulin concentration between groups (p = 0.28), although the group on long days had lower concentrations at all hours. The concentration of plasma prolactin was lower during the dark hours than during the light hours (p<0.05). In the second experiment, 36 first calvers were stalled 6–8 weeks before expected calving following a period of grazing. The stalling involved a substantial decrease in daily maximum light intensity for the cows. From the first day in experiment to 10 days before expected calving, the plasma prolactin concentration decreased from 41.5 ± 3.7 to 29.0 ± 3.3 μg/l, p<0.05, equally in both groups. After calving, the plasma prolactin concentration increased in the DL group (b=4.20 ± 1.93 μg/l/w, p<0.05) to a higher level than at the start of the experiment. There was no difference in milk production (p>0.50). The results indicate that a continuously increasing secretion of prolactin in the last month of gestation may promote milk production in early lactation.",

Positive assortative mating produced the highest cumulative selection response (11.61–13.24 σ P ), followed by random mating (11.00–12.48 σ P ) and negative assortative mating (10.88–11.98 σ P ). The differences between the various mating systems were highly significant (P < 0.001) after the second generation and depended on the covariance due to linkage disequilibrium (C 1) and varying rates of fixation of the favourable alleles, leading to different genic variance (V a). Positive assortative mating first caused C 1 to increase to maximum values equal to 10.8% of the base population genetic variance (V A) when the trait was controlled by 100 loci and then to decline gradually. A faster rate of change in gene frequency caused V ato decrease initially, but to return towards random mating levels later (after generations 13–17 when the trait was controlled by 100 loci), when fixation of the favourable alleles approached completion. Inbreeding coefficient and degree of homozygosity increased slightly under positive assortative mating.

Almost 95% of the variation in lifetime income and cost was due to milk income or feed cost. The relative risk of culling (hazard) was maximum at approximately yearly intervals starting at 10 months of productive life. All lifetime economic traits were strongly affected by the length of productive life. The increase in, especially, lifetime net income per year, but also in lifetime income divided by cost with increased productive life, was highly curvilinear. This resulted from the spreading of the large heifer cost over an increasing productive life. When productive life exceeded two lactations the increase was smaller and fairly linear. A higher age at first calving was associated with lower lifetime economic performance, even though productive life increased slightly. The effect of month of first calving on lifetime economic traits was similar to its effect on milk yield. Considering various characteristics, lifetime income divided by cost seems to be the best trait for use as a single trait in the breeding goal.",

    "abstract": "In this review paper, the term 'availability' is used to describe the supply of nutrients and energy from the digestive tract to the body tissues. The traditional method for the estimation of nutrient and energy availability is to determine the apparent digestibility. This method has been a cornerstone in the development of all existing feed evaluation systems, both in ruminant and in non-ruminant nutrition. The apparent digestibility of a nutrient is an underestimation of the true digestibility to the extent that endogenous secretions of this nutrient are excreted in the faeces. Other factors such as microbial degradation and syntheses in the digestive tract contribute to invalidate the apparent digestibility as a measure of nutrient availability. These problems are particularly related to protein and amino acids. Alternative methods to estimate nutrient availability have been developed. Some of these are invasive and some are non-invasive. In the first category, pigs are cannulated at various sites of the digestive tract or catheterized in an artery and the portal vein. Non-invasive methods include isotopic labelling of the feed, in vitro assays and the use of mechanistic modelling. The virtues and drawbacks of these methods are discussed and it is concluded that progress in the field of predicting nutrient availability and in the development of future, nutrient-based feed evaluation systems is most likely to occur when various experimental and modelling techniques are integrated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herbage intake by strip-grazed dairy cows was estimated, using chromic oxide as marker, during experimental periods covering different parts of the grazing season, different sward heights and different years. Herbage mass, herbage composition and the milk yield, live weight, lactation week and age of experimental animals were also registered with the objective of including those variables that were significant in a model for studying the influence of sward height and season on herbage intake. Pastures were grazed when planned target sward height was obtained. Average sward height over all experimental periods was 15.0 cm (range 7.4-21.2). The grazing season was divided into early season (May 17 to June 19), mid-season (June 20 to July 31) and late season (August 1 to August 20). The data comprise herbage intake measurements on 69 dairy cows with an average milk yield and live weight of 15.6 kg/day and 546 kg, respectively. Pasture allowance was 30 kg dry matter/cow and day. The content of metabolizable energy and the digestibility of organic matter in the pasture was 11.2, 10.2 and 10.2 MJ/kg DM and 77.8, 72.4 and 72.4% for early, mid- and late season, respectively. The variables sward height, season, milk yield, live weight and year, and the interaction between sward height and season, were significant in the statistical analysis and were thus included in the model. In early season, herbage intake increased by 0.8 kg organic matter (OM) per cm increase in sward height. In mid-season, intake was significantly lowered at pasture heights below 9 cm, while in late season there were no differences in intake at different sward heights. Least square means for herbage intake during the early, mid- and late season were 12.8, 12.3 and 10.2 kg OM per cow and day, respectively. Late season intake was significantly lower (P < 0.001 and P <0.01) compared with intake during early season and mid-season, respectively. In the model obtained, the influence of milk yield and live weight on herbage OM intake was 0.2 kg OM per kg milk and 0.5 kg OM per 100 kg live weight, respectively.",

On days 5 and 55 of the treatment, the sensitivity of the pituitary to growth hormone-releasing factor was tested. Repeated deprivation of lying down did not affect voluntary feed intake or meat quality. Likewise, feed efficiency and daily intake did not differ statistically, but numerically the reduction was in accordance with the hypothesis that long-term stress depresses performance. Between-animal variation appears to be markedly increased for traits such as daily gain and feed conversion ratio, indicating individual adaptation to long-term stress. Stressed animals tended to have lower circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I but no effect was observed on the sensitivity of the pituitary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A total of 730 dark mink, half of each sex, representing 94 paternal progeny groups originating from 16 farms were housed on a test station from about 10 weeks of age until pelting. Average daily feed consumption in paternal progeny groups was registered daily. Individual body weights were recorded five times. Feed consumption, feed efficiency and weight gain in paternal progeny groups were calculated in four subperiods corresponding to the times of weighing. These traits, body weights and length of pelts were analysed for differences between paternal progeny groups and farms of origin. A considerable difference between farms of origin and paternal progeny groups was found for most traits, indicating genetic variation. Correlations between averages of paternal progeny groups were calculated, and interpreted as approximations to genetic correlations. Feed consumption was highly correlated across periods. Feed efficiency showed low to medium correlations between periods. A favourable correlation was found between efficiency of weight gain and efficiency of longitudinal growth.

Sows of White composite, with either 1/4 Meishan, 1/4 Duroc or 1/8 Duroc were kept for up to six parities and reproductive performance and lifetime productivity of each sow breed was recorded. Progeny from these sows were analysed for growth and carcass characteristics. It was noted that Meishan genotype sows were more prolific (+1 pig/litter -1 ; P <0.05) and had greater longevity in the herd than either of the Duroc genotypes. The growth rate of slaughter pigs from 1/4 Meishan sows was slower than that of either 1/8 or 1/4 Duroc (893, 976 and 931 g day -1 , respectively; P <0.05) and they had poorer carcass lean content (56, 59 and 58%, respectively; P <0.05). The study would suggest that 1/4 Meishan sows may be useful for systems with low costs of production, small penalties for fat carcasses and where gilt replacement costs are high.",

Two ratios based on the balances of ammonia and sensible heat, and ammonia and carbon dioxide, respectively, in animal houses were determined and considered to give characteristic levels of the release of ammonia in relation to the animal density independently of the ventilation rate. This required measurements of ammonia, carbon dioxide and temperature with hand-held instruments in the buildings and in outside air. In total, 34 dairy herds were investigated in the south of Sweden. The results clearly demonstrated higher release of ammonia from free stall barn with liquid manure than from conventional tie stall barn with solid manure. There was a clear effect of the content of crude protein, gram per kg dry matter, in the total feed ration on ammonia release in tie stall barn with liquid manure.",

A total of 103 cows were divided into two groups on two farms. Before the experiment, the cows had an average milk yield of 26.9 kg ECM and they were in milk for an average of 99 days. Their average parity was 2.3 and their weight 596 kg. The cows in each group received either solely barley or an isoenergetic mixture of rape cake seed and barley as supplement. The supplement feed was fed frequently by automatic feeding. A mixture of clover grass silage and whole crop silage was fed ad libitum . The daily milk yields were not significantly different in the barley and rape seed cake treatment (22.8 vs 24.1 kg). The milk fat content was not significant different either (4.51% vs 4.35%). However, the protein content tended to be higher in the barley treatment (3.51% vs 3.45%). But the energy corrected milk yield (ECM) was not significantly different in the barley and rape seed cake treatments either (24.2 vs 24.9 kg ECM). No differences in health as indicated by clinical illness treated by the vet and somatic cell count (SCC) was seen. It was concluded that barley and a mixture of isoenergic rape seed cake and barley had similar feeding value when used as supplement with a high proportion of easily digestible clover grass silage allocated ad libitum and frequently allocation of supplementary feed.",

Different genetic models were tested, and a random regression animal model with a 4th order Legendre polynomial for the permanent environmental effect for both traits, a 1st order Legendre polynomial for the additive genetic effect of EC and a 2nd order Legendre polynomial for the additive genetic effect of SCS, gave the best fit. The patterns of the curves were similar for both permanent environmental and additive genetic variance for the two traits. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.05 to 0.12, and from 0.01 to 0.09, for EC and SCS, respectively. The estimate of genetic correlation between the traits was high, and ranged from 0.86 to 0.98.

Animals were allocated to one of four treatments: basal unpellitized concentrate diet (control) and three diets in which a portion of the concentrate in the basal diet (6.72% DM prepartum; 15.7% DM postpartum) was pelletized and amino acids were added as follows: basal pellet (PEL), PEL plus lysine and methionine (PAA), and PAA plus choline (PAC). Pelletizing a portion of the diet (PEL) results in a significant increase in milk yield compared with the unpellitized control and addition of Lys and Met (PAA) but not choline (PAC) increased the yield further. Milk composition did not differ among treatments, but their yields increased by inclusion of Lys and Met-containing pelletized concentrate. Feeding Lys and Met-containing pelletized concentrate resulted in higher N conversion and fat content of milk compared with control and PEL. Cows on pelletized concentrate containing Lys and Met with or without choline tended to have lower serum non-esterified fatty acid, but no differences were observed in other parameters. It is concluded that pelletizing of a portion of concentrate can improve milk production and there is an additional beneficial effect of Lys and Met supplementation on yield and N and fat content of milk, but no additional effect of adding choline was observed.",

An interaction between time and treatment affected weight change (P < 0.001), where all piglets lost weight during the first hour., Piglets with access to water continued loosing weight (82.1 ± 32.8 g over 8 h), milk-replacer-piglets gained 88.6 ± 53.2 g and bovine-colostrum-piglets gained 55.7 ± 66.5 g over 8 h. Overall, piglets with access to the simulated udder gained weight during their first eight hours postpartum. An interaction between temperature at first handling and time (P < 0.001) as well as an interaction between time and treatment (P < 0.001) affected temperature. Further development of the method could reduce the need for nurse sows.",

Silage replaced 20% of the crude protein (g/kg). Diet affected daily N excretion, which was higher for pigs fed Silage-Ch and Silage-Pr than for pigs in the Pellet-S and Control treatments. Ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) content in the manure and NH3 volatilization from fresh manure were higher for Control pigs than for pigs in the other treatments. Overall, these results show that pre-treatment of silage influences N utilization and excretion.

With a view to understanding the metabolic implications of this historic selection – and also laying a foundation to better interpret current commercial performance – we quantitated the cellular bioenergetic structure of modern broilers. The breast muscle of 4 64 d old Ross308 broilers was subject to morphometric analysis based on transverse Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images. This approach determined an average mitochondrial content, diameter and circularity ratio of 2.1%, 0.42 µm and 0.72, respectively. Broiler breast mitochondrial content has thus approximately halved in the last 45 years and represents one of the lowest contents recorded for the muscle of any eukaryotic species.KEYWORDS: Musclemitochondriachicken Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

Forty horses were divided into a control and three vitamin E supplementation (experimental) groups. The levels of the vitamin E supplementation in the three experimental groups were 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight (bwt) per day. The vitamin was dosed orally. The supplementation was started either at the beginning or in the middle of the indoor (winter) feeding period. There was seasonal variation in the serum vitamin E content; the serum vitamin concentration increased during the grazing and decreased during the indoor feeding period. The basal feeding and a daily supplement of 1 mg/kg bwt were not adequate to maintain or increase the serum vitamin E concentration during the indoor feeding period in an exercising horse. The minimum daily intake of vitamin E would seem to be greater than 1.5 mg/kg bwt. It is suggested that a daily supplement of 3 to 5 mg/kg bwt may be required by horses in training to increase the serum vitamin E levels. This amounts to 1500–2500 mg/day for a horse weighing 500 kg. Supplementation should be started at the beginning of the indoor feeding period.",

These reductions by salbutamol were induced at 60 kg body weight and remained unchanged. On the other hand, salbutamol did not affect the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total glycogen synthetase (GS), the glucose-6-phosphate independent form of GS, and muscle glycogen content. The activity of LDH increased by 41% from 25 to 90 kg body weight (P<0.001), with the steepest increase from 25 to 45 kg body weight, while the activities of CS and HAD decreased by 25 (P<0.001) and 19% (P<0.001) in control animals, respectively. The total GS activity was decreased at 60 and 90 kg body weight by 24% (P<0.01), whereas the independent form of GS did not change in the body weight range examined. The glycogen content was reduced by 20% (P<0.05) at 90 kg body weight compared to the other body weights. These results indicate that salbutamol treatment decreases muscle oxidative capacity.

    "abstract": "Abstract The properties of isolated sheets of bovine rumen epithelium in the Ussing chamber system were studied. The viability and time-dependent change in performance, as expressed by electrical parameters, was acceptable and comparable to what has been obtained with other epithelia in vitro. The viability and time-dependent change in performance was not influenced by transport time (5 to 45 minutes) between the slaughterhouse and the laboratory. Flux rates of 22Na+ and 14C-propionate showed that an equilibration period of 45 minutes after addition of tracers will be sufficient to obtain steady-state conditions with this epithelium. Compared with the time-dependent changes in electrical parameters, this shows that rumen epithelium cannot truly be used as its own control over time. The varying papillation caused surface enlargement factors between one and five, estimated by the dry weight of stripped epithelium. However, the dry weight was not correlated to epithelial capacitance or flux rates. It is concluded that the papillae do not contribute significantly to the fluxes measured in vitro, and that correction for surface enlargement is not essential for the evaluation of flux data. The pH was 0.27 to 0.40 units lower at the epithelial surface than in the bulk solution, and the pH difference was not influenced by glucose or SCFA free solutions, nor by Amiloride (1 mmol 1−1). The observed lower epithelial surface pH seems not to be an acidic microclimate in the traditional sense, but could be explained by a negatively charged surface potential of the epithelial cells.",

Four barrows, initial body weight (BW) 33.8 ± 1.0 kg, were fitted with a simple T‐cannula at the distal ileum and one catheter in each of the external jugular veins. The pigs were fed 1.65 kg day−1 of a wheat, fish meal and casein‐based diet, formulated to contain 180 g protein (N x 6.25) day kg−1. 15N‐leucine, dissolved in saline, was infused into the right catheter at a rate of approximately 40 mg kg BW−1 day−1 for a total of 9 days. The contribution (%) of endogenous AA, which ranged from 17.0 to 84.5%, to total AA in ileal digesta was determined from the dilution of 15N‐enrichment (atom percent excess) in the individual AA in digesta compared with free AA in blood plasma. In addition, the dilution of 15N‐enrichment in leucine in digesta compared with free leucine in blood plasma was used to predict the endogenous contribution of the other AA, which ranged from 13.9 to 36.0%, and protein (17.4%). The endogenous output of protein was 7.59 g kg dry matter intake (DMI)−1. Endogenous AA outputs ranged from 0.13 to 2.79 g kg DMI−1 and real ileal digestibilities, calculated by correcting apparent digestibilities for endogenous losses, ranged from 73.2 to 97.6%.

The study was based on digestibility trials with sheep on 17 samples of fodder galega in connection with a harvest management experiment in which cutting frequency and time of first harvest varied. The main results were, first, that the concentration of crude protein, DOM (in vivo), DE (in vivo) and feed units for cattle (FUC) decreased by delaying harvest of the first cut. The concentration of fibre expressed as crude fibre, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) increased by delaying harvest at the first and following cuts. Fodder galega differed from other legumes not included in this study by having a higher concentration of hemicellulose calculated as NDF-ADF, while the mean concentration of DE (in vivo) and FUC was nearly equal to the mean concentration in red clover, winter vetch and yellow lupins. Secondly, DOM in fodder galega may be predicted by using an equation based on the concentration of IVOMD, and DE in fodder galega may be predicted by using another equation based on the concentrations of GE and DOM. The two equations were developed on the basis of this investigation of fodder galega. Thirdly, DE predicted on the basis of the chemical composition of DOM in fodder galega deviated considerable from in vivo DE. The conclusions were that the chemical composition, digestibility and feeding value of fodder galega changed when the yield increased by delaying harvest, especially at the first cut.

Both genetic and phenotypic correlations among protein yield and protein and fat content traits were small. The genetic correlation between milk yield and protein content was -0.61, between milk yield and fat content -0.50 and between protein content and fat content 0.67. Absolute values of phenotypic correlations for the same pairs of traits were somewhat smaller than respective genetic correlations.",

The results of sequencing showed that the open reading frame of GH gene for WZSP contained 217 amino acids including the signal peptide of 26 amino acids and the coding sequence of GHR gene for WZSP contained 639 amino acids including the signal peptide of 18 amino acids. Two substitutions of amino acids found in the signal peptide of GH gene may affect the transport of GH. Five mutations found in the cytoplasmic domain of GHR may possibly influence GHR signal downstream transduction.",

We used data from 20 inbred lines and 10 control lines to test this hypothesis. Two models were used: a standard quantitative genetics model based on the infinitesimal model, and an extension of this model. In the extended model it is assumed that each individual has its own environmental variance and that this heterogeneity of variance has a genetic component. The heterogeneous variance model was favoured by the data, indicating that the environmental variance is partly under genetic control. If this heterogeneous variance model also applies to livestock, it would be possible to select for animals with a higher uniformity of products across environmental regimes. Also for evolutionary biology the results are of interest as genes affecting the environmental variance may be important for adaptation to changing environmental conditions.",

We found that bee breeders falsely classified admixed stocks based on morphometry as purebred and vice versa.

In this model, appetitive motivational state is linked to the seeking/wanting of a resource, a consummatory motivational state is linked with sensory pleasure and a post-consummatory motivational state is associated with satiety/relaxation. The study focused on foraging-related behaviours in chicks. A pen was designed with three equally sized areas, a litter, feed and dark area. The results showed that it was possible to at least partially separate appetitive, consummatory and post-consummatory behaviour and that the chicks were highly synchronized in their behaviour and their use of the pen areas.",

The addition of WDDGS in the diet increased total volatile fatty acids, in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) and slightly lowered ruminal culture pH. In the in situ study, the WDDGS diets demonstrated faster rate of neutral detergent fibre degradation (k, h−1) compared with control diet. In the in vivo study, dry matter intake was about 14% higher for sheep fed 40% WDDGS compared to control or 20% WDDGS. The inclusion of WDDGS in the rations improved greasy and clean wool production, and staple length. This study showed up to 40% WDDGS could replace rolled barley grain in Merino sheep rations to improve wool production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic variation in plasma growth hormone (GH) concentration before and after GRF (growth hormone releasing factor) stimulation was studied in young bulls (N=284) and heifers (N=212), the progeny of 53 sires of four dairy and dual-purpose breeds (Danish Jersey, Red Dane, Danish Friesian and Danish Red and White). Male and female calves were reared, fed and tested on separate experimental stations; thus sex, station and feeding were completely confounded effects. The animals were tested at about 9 months of age, after a 24 h fast. GH concentration was measured in serial plasma samples collected for 1 h before and 1 h following intravenous administration of 2.0 ug synthetic GRF(1–29)NH2/kg live weight>0.75. Prior to statistical analysis, concentrations were loge-transformed. Response variables were BASELINE (mean GH in -15, -5 and 0 min samples) and PEAK (mean GH in 10, 15 and 20 min samples). A statistical model taking at least three generations of ancestral relationships into account was used to estimate variance and covariance components for traits in male and female calves by use of restricted maximum likelihood methods. Heritability of BASELINE was low (0.04 ± 0.12) in males but high in females (0.60 ± 0.16). The heritability of PEAK was high in both sexes (males, 0.42 ± 0.16; females, 0.60 ± 0.16). Genetic correlations between the same trait measured in males and females were low for BASELINE (r g = 0.32±0.55) but high for PEAK (r g = 0.82±0.15). Within sex, BASELINE and PEAK were both highly genetically correlated (males, r g=0.62 ± 0.40; females, r g= 1.00 ± 0.07). We conclude that growth hormone concentration is a highly heritable trait in juvenile cattle of both sexes, and that GRF stimulation is benificial to the uncovering of genetic differences among animals.

    "abstract": "Abstract This investigation was performed to study the effects of restricted versus ad libitum feeding on carcass composition, on protein and fat accretion and on body development and organ weights. The carcass composition was evaluated on 168 pigs by serial slaughter at 20, 50, 80 and 110 kg LW. The chemical composition was examined in only 62 of these animals. The carcasses were partitioned into four cuts and dissected into lean meat, fatty tissue, rind and bones. Ad libitum feeding resulted in daily weight gain exceeding restricted feeding in the three weight ranges by 42%, 17% and 7% and feed conversion ratios by 3%, 15% and 9%, respectively. Castrated males exceeded daily weight gains of females by 6%. At 20 kg the carcass moisture content was 65% for both sexes, which on average over feed regimens at 110 kg decreased to 56% and 52% for females and castrated males, respectively. Correspondingly, the carcass crude fat (CF) content increased from 13% to 24% and 30%, respectively. At 110 kg LW on restricted feeding the carcass meat content of females exceeded that of castrated males by 1.7, and on ad libitum feeding by 3.9 percentage units; correspondingly, carcass fatty tissue of castrated males exceeded those values for females by 0.5 and 3.9 percentage units, respectively. Daily carcass crude protein (CP) accretion on ad libitum feeding for females and castrated males for the interval 22–111 kg LW was, on average, 95 g. Daily caracass CF accretion on ad libitum feeding exceeded that on restricted feeding by 34%. Ad libitum fed castrated males and females showed daily CF accretion rates of 231 g and 158 g, respectively. Ad libitum feeding increased weights of liver over restricted feeding by 12% (P < 0.01) and kidneys by 21% (P < 0.001). Feed regimen also influenced CF content of muscles. It is concluded that feed regimen influenced carcass CP content at slaughter only to a limited extent, but greatly influenced daily CP accretion. However, carcass CF content and daily CF accretion were largely influenced by feed regimen and sex. These differences became manifest after 50 kg LW. Feed regimen also influenced liver and kidney weights.",

In most experiments (8 out of 9; no information in 2), significant antibody formation was reported in immunized animals but antibody formation may vary between individuals. Only a few have reported data on antibody affinity, but available data indicate that the antibodies formed may act to neutralize SS rather than function as binding proteins. Meta-analysis on weighted group averages showed that anti-SS animals consumed 4.2 ± 1.4% more feed (P = 0.03), had a 11.4 ± 2.3% higher daily gain (P < 0.001) and had a 4.7 ± 2.1% lower feed conversion ratio (P = 0.06), indicating improved feed efficiency. Increased fat deposition has been observed following immunization against SS, but more studies are needed in order to quantify the changes. Immunization does not seem to affect dressing percentage or carcass conformation score. The mode of action of immunization against SS seems to be associated with IGF-I and not GH, but more studies are needed to clarify fully the mechanisms by which immunization modifies performance in cattle.",

Forage chopped by different machines to almost equal median particle length (23-29 mm) produced silage of very different quality, probably because of different degrees of tissue disruption. Forage chopped in a cutter head (CUT) or by a forage wagon (FW) resulted in silage with high clostridial activity and low lactic acid formation in contrast to PC forage, which produced high quality silage without butyric acid.

Energy and protein content varied depending on feed ingredients but requirements of essential amino acids were satisfied. Increased oats/wheat ratios caused increased feed consumption, egg mass production (g hen−1 day−1), egg weight, enhanced yolk pigmentation and increased dry matter in the excreta. A higher oats/wheat ratio also lowered the energy intake kg−1 egg produced and bird live weight. The LSL hens had a better feed conversion ratio, a lower energy intake kg−1 egg produced compared with SLU‐1329 hens. Egg quality traits showed that SLU‐1329 had heavier eggs than LSL, but lower albumen height, thinner shells and higher egg deformation values.

Three levels of silage fermentation were obtained by using a bacterial inoculant (B), Foraform at approximately 4 L t−1(F) and Maxgrass at approximately 6Lt−1 (M) as silage additives. In all 3 years treatment B produced approximately twice as much fermentation products in the silage as treatment M, and treatment F was intermediate. Treatment M successfully preserved water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) in the silage only with the high DM crop in experiment 2 (272 g kg−1). As means over the 3 years, treatment M with restricted fermentation increased silage DM intake by 1.1 kg, milk fat content by 1.9 g kg−1 and milk protein content by 0.6 g kg−1 compared with the extensively fermented silage (B). In experiment 2, when WSC were successfully preserved with treatment M, milk protein content increased by 1.2 g kg−1 compared with treatment B. It is concluded from these trials and literature that the extent of silage fermentation affects DM intake and content of milk solids, but has only marginal effects on milk yield.

Thirty-six male Wistar rats, initial liveweight (LW) 77-79 g, were allocated to six groups and housed at either 18°C (three groups) or 28°C (three groups). Three wheat starch, fish meal and pea fibre-based diets were prepared to contain 100, 200 and 300 g pea fibre kg−1 (68, 110 and 157 g dietary fibre kg−1 DM) and 160 g protein (N × 6.25) kg−1. One group of rats at each temperature was fed one of the diets for four balance periods. Gas-exchange measurements were made and urine and faeces were quantitatively collected. Food to gain ratio was higher (P <.05) at 18°C than at 28°C and increased (P <.05) as the level of fibre was increased. The weight of the visceral organs from rats housed at 18°C was higher (P<.05) than at 28°C. The empty weight of the small intestine, caecum and colon increased (P <.05) as the level of pea fibre was increased. The digestibility of DM, protein and dietary fibre (DF) was lower (P <.05) at 18°C than at 28°C. As the level of pea fibre was increased, the digestibilities of nutrients and energy decreased (P <.05). However, the digestibility of DF increased (P <.05) as the level of pea fibre was increased. The partial digested energy value for pea fibre was 11.9 kJ g−1. The metabolizable energy (ME) intake and heat production at 18°C (1128 and 974 kJ (W0.75 day)−1 respectively) were higher (P<.05) than at 28°C (831 and 674 kJ (W0.75 day)−1 respectively). As the level of pea fibre was increased, ME intake (W0.75 day)−1 and heat production (W0.75 day)−1 decreased (P <.05). Heat production as a percentage of ME was higher (P <.05) at 18°C than at 28°C: 86.6% and 81.2%, respectively. Heat production as a percentage of ME was higher (P <.05) for rats fed the 100 g pea fibre kg−1 diet than the 200 or 300 g pea fibre kg−1 diet. In conclusion, environmental temperature as well as DF influenced digestive tract and visceral organ size, digestion and protein and energy metabolism.",

The structure of the report depends on the objective of the welfare assessment. Further, the report is an integral part of the welfare assessment process, and it should be able to function as a decision support tool introducing animal welfare considerations on the farm. The report may aim to provide an overview, or an evaluation of present welfare levels in the herd, or detailed data which document the welfare situation. The overview allows priorities to be set among welfare-motivated interventions on the farm. Documentation serves to link conclusions on animal welfare to exact observations on the farm regarding the chosen welfare indicators. It thereby enables the farmer to relate to the welfare assessment. The evaluation provides a frame of reference and a conclusion as to whether the level of animal welfare on the farm is satisfactory. All three elements are important to the farmer. A prototype of the welfare assessment report has therefore been developed presenting overview, evaluation and documentation in a hierarchical structure. This ensures that the report is readable and problem-oriented.",

However, high levels of fish oil resulted in lower kit weights at weaning. These negative effects on kit growth were related to the dietary composition fed during the lactation and early growth periods and not to the diet used during the preceding winter and pregnancy periods.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary link between feelings of pleasure and aversion (affect) behaviour means that measurement of the behaviour of animals can give a unique insight into their own perception of the welfare value of potential enrichment techniques. Consumer demand theory allows ethologists to measure objectively the strength of preference for resources. The current study assessed the extent to which different methods of applying demand theory to laboratory mice would affect the order of prioritisation of four resources. Overall the two methods used showed some agreement, particularly in the prioritisation of food as the most important resource. However in other respects the methods led to different results, for example in the effect of increasing cost on the number of visits to resources. The importance of using animals' behaviour when making practical welfare assessments is emphasised.",

For bulls born from 1974 to 1990 a flat genetic trend for clinical mastitis was found. However, bull sires born from 1983 onwards, selected on a breeding goal with increased weight on mastitis relative to milk production, showed consistently larger and favourable selection differentials for mastitis relative to bull sires born earlier, which had an average selection differential of approximately zero. This will influence genetic trend in the population through their sons, which were born from 1990 onwards. Keywords: Clinical MastitisDairy CattleGenetic Trend",

Diet RGP55 promoted higher (p < 0.05) overall feed intake (934.3 g/bird) than diet RGP35 (809.2 g/bird). The NegCon diet promoted the highest breast meat lightness (L*) value (46.1) while the lowest value (42.7) was observed in RGP35 meat. In conclusion, quail birds reared on RGP-containing diets had similar physiological and meat quality parameters as those on the antibiotic-containing diet. An optimum inclusion level could not be determined using the physiological and meat quality responses, suggesting a need to investigate higher levels of dietary RGP.",

A slaughter trial was conducted with a total of 58 individually housed pigs (48–106 kg). The energetic efficiency was monitored at two energy levels; the lysine supply of the pigs was limiting for protein deposition. Control diets were fed either at two or three times of maintenance energy requirement, and the treatments were achieved by isoenergetic addition of the daily nutrient intake (0.2 MJ DE/kg0.75) derived either from fNSP, or digestible starch (dSt), or digestible fat (dFat) above the nutrients from the control diets. Chemical composition of the pigs was determined at 48±4 kg (10 pigs) or 106±3 kg body weight (BW) (48 pigs). In conclusion, under protein limiting conditions, the energetic transformation of fNSP, dSt, and dFat for fat retention (NEfat/DE) was 62%, 80%, and 57%, respectively. The efficiency of fat deposition from a specific energy source was constant, irrespective of the actual feeding level.

The use of the guideline results in colostrum with a temperature of 40–42°C, which is ideal for feeding the newborn calfs. In the analysis of IgG, we took into consideration that the dry matter content of colostrum varied from 15 to 35%. Before heating 30% of the samples had less than 50 mg IgG/ml, which is the threshold of good quality colostrum. The generally low level of IgG in colostrum indicates that it is important for the health of newborn calves, not to denature IgG during the heating process. Therefore the established guideline will help the dairy farmer to supply the newborn calf with sufficient IgG and thereby improve the health of the calf. Furthermore, we demonstrated that heating thawed colostrum gave a more homogeneous result than heating frozen colostrum.

The findings suggested moderate heritability for some temperament traits assessed by riders in BFTs and showed that the assessment method needs to be improved in order for judges to discern the variation in these traits. Furthermore, according to estimated correlations the score for spirit described only part of the general temperament of the horse, where aspects of general nerve strength was not well covered.

In a pilot experiment the keto acid diet had been fed to 5-month-old salmon during 5 weeks without adverse effects on growth and the body amino acid content. Nitrogen excretion was markedly diminished. In the major experiment the 16–17-month-old presmolt salmon were divided into four groups. After one week on the diets one control and one keto acid group were continuously exposed to 17-β-estradiol by implanting a capsule containing the hormone. After further 4 weeks the fish were killed. The vitellogenin concentration in the plasma was 50.5 ± 5.1 mg and 56.7 ± 5.2 mg/ml for the hormone treated fish fed the control and the keto acid diet, respectively. Liver glycogen content decreased during hormone treatment, but the fish fed on the keto acids were less affected. Upon exposure to estradiol the activity of tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) and malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) was diminished in both feeding groups. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) was elevated in activity after feeding the keto acid diet but was unaffected by hormone treatment. Isocitric dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) and glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) were elevated in activity after hormone treatment of the fish fed on the keto acids. Fatty acid synthetase (EC 2.3.1.38) as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) plus 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.43) were unchanged by dietary and hormonal conditions. The high vitellogenin synthesis in the liver was reflected in a decrease in protein content per g wet weight of muscle. Proteins of sarcoplasmic origin were more affected by estradiol treatment than those of myofibrillar origin. No differences between the dietary conditions were noted. Muscle glycogen content was elevated in the fish fed on the keto acids without an effect by estradiol. In summary, a utilization of dietary pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate in carbohydrate metabolism seemed to occur. Pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate can be used as an alternative carbohydrate source in the diet. The advantage of such a diet is the diminished nitrogen excretion by the fish into the water without a negative effect on growth and vitellogenin synthesis.",

Organic matter digestibility and crude protein content decreased rapidly until grain filling at maturity code 55 (range of study, 2-digit codes 37 to 91) and then remained fairly constant. The yield of digestible organic matter increased with increasing stage of maturity (2nd degree polynomial function, P < 0.001). The study at three stages of maturity (code 83, 86 and 91) showed an increase in the ear fraction (48 to 57% plant dry matter, DM) and a decrease in plant remainder fraction (whole plant without ear, NOEAR) (52 to 43%) due to maturation. However, within NOEAR the leaf sheath fraction remained unchanged and both the leaf blade and stem fractions decreased. Generally, the highest nutritive value was measured for leaf blade and sheath in the uppermost internode, but for stem in either the upper most internode or lowest internode. The most distinct maturation effects were observed in the upper leaf blades. Nutrient translocation in context with changes in internodial nutrient concentration during maturation is discussed. The present results indicate, that whole-crop barley should be harvested at yellow ripeness (code 91).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic and non-genetic sources of variation were estimated within and between populations in a progeny testing scheme with approximately 200 paternal progeny groups of mink. Animals from several populations were housed at a central test station and corresponding full-sibs were kept at the farm of origin. Body weight was recorded in the production period, and the length of the dried skins was measured after pelting. Significant environmental and genetic population differences were found accounting for 20–30% of the total variation. Environmental and genetic differences were on average up to 1.9 and 1.6 phenotypic standard deviations, indicating a potential for improved breeding schemes. Most heritability estimates varied between 0.2 and 0.4, lower than earlier estimates within populations. Maternal effects accounted for 10–40% of the variation in most cases. There was a large difference between sexes, and males and females were found to react differently to environmental effects. Furthermore, an interaction between the genetic level and sex was found.",

    "abstract": "Records of 4103 scanblack mink kits born in 1989–94 were used to estimate genetic parameters for body weight and body length during the growth season with special emphasis on the suckling period. Maternal additive and direct additive effects and effects of permanent maternal and specific litter environment were estimated, using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) in univariate and bivariate animal models. The maternal additive effect was constant during the first 4 weeks after parturition at h2 m ≈ 0.30 for weight, and decreased thereafter. The heritability estimate for direct additive effect for body weight decreased from h2 a ≈ 0.19 at birth to h2 a ≈ 0.12 at 4 weeks but increased to h2 a ≈ 0.50 in August to December. The maternal permanent environment was important only at 2 and 4 weeks, c2 p ≈ 0.10. The specific environment, common within the litter, increased from c2 s ≈ 0.24 at birth to c2 s≈ 0.40 at 2 and 4 weeks, but decreased thereafter to c2 s ≈ 0.10 in December. Estimates for body length showed a slightly different pattern, h2 a varying from 0.07 to 0.17 in the lactation period, but increased to 0.46 at pelting. The heritability of maternal additive effect (h2 m) for body length varied from 0.17 to 0.24 during the lactation period and decreased thereafter to 0.06 at pelting. The results indicate that selection for maternal traits should be based on kit body weight, or body length within 4 weeks after birth, or on growth from 2 to 4 weeks. The largest direct response for body weight would be obtained by selection on body weight in August‐December.",

In this study, effluent from ensiled direct‐cut grass was retained in closed‐drainage tower silos, such that silage and effluent were stored together but the effluent was released prior to the silage being fed. Silage quality was good, similar to that from a silo with normal open drainage. The quality of silage effluent from the closed‐drainage silo tended to be better than that of effluent stored in a separate tank. Decreased compaction of the ensilage mass, due to collection of effluent in the silo, led to a 13% reduction in the silo's crop capacity and 10% in its silage capacity, but no reduction in its total feed dry matter (DM) capacity (silage plus effluent). The total storage volume, however, was better utilized for feed DM when silage and effluent were stored together in the silo than when stored separately in silo plus tank. However, owing to problems caused by effluent leakage via trapdoors and small holes in the silo wall, the use of silos with open drainage and storage of effluent in separate tanks is recommended.",

The age traits and corresponding time records were recorded for 2–6-year-old SBT and 3–7-year-old FHT. Best career time was recorded for 3–5-year-old SBT and 4–6-year-old FHT. The heritability (h 2) estimates for AFQ, APQ and AFR were very low, those for FHT being even lower than for SBT. The traits AFQ, APQ and AFR were highly correlated both genetically and phenotypically. Generally, the h 2 estimates obtained for time records were high in Standardbred trotters, considerably higher than in Finnhorses. It is likely that the h 2 estimates for SBT were overestimated and those for FHT underestimated. The highest h 2 estimate for both breeds was obtained for the time record in the first race. In SBT, a positive genetic correlation was found between the age traits and best career time. In FHT, these correlations had higher absolute values but opposite signs, compared with the estimates observed for SBT. The genetic correlations between the time records and best career time were high in both breeds (0.94–1.00 in SBT; 0.77–0.94 in FHT). Key Words: heritabilityhorseracehorseREMLsire modeltrotting",

Based on the results for the genetic constitution, cows were grouped as (i) pure Friesian cows, (ii) cows with 25% Holstein genes and (iii) cows with 50% Holstein genes. The estimated breeding values for protein yield, days open and somatic cell count were used to investigate the effect of increasing Holstein blood in the Finnish Black and White cattle population. The results showed that the proportion of Holstein genes in the Black and White cows increased from 0.2% in 1976 to 33.3% in 1991. The proportions of genes due to the contributions of Ayrshire and Finncattle decreased from 8.8% and 3.0% in 1976 to 6.0% and 0.4% in 1991, respectively. The Holsteinization caused only a small increase in protein yield but a considerably higher increase in days open. The variation in EBVs for somatic cell count was somewhat smaller for cows with 25% or 50% Holstein genes.",

Random regression mixed models were used to evaluate changes in variances through the productive life of dairy cows in body weight and in each of the physical measures. To indicate the frame size of a cow's body, a frame index was established based on linear physical measures, which was a simple cross-product of body depth by hip width. Further analyses with a random regression mixed model indicated that the changes in the index values over age reflect well the process of growth, and were only marginally affected by stages of lactation. Frame index and body weight were highly correlated. However, if breeding for frame size was desired, the frame index would be a preferred selection criterion over the more conventional criterion of body weight, because body weight measures were affected equally by growth and body condition.",

In the first of two experiments (A), 32 yearling heifers (16 H and 16 L, at 307–424 days of age) were tested by use of four doses of growth hormone releasing factor (GRF); 0.02, 0.10, 0.50 and 2.50 μg/kg live weight, on 4 consecutive days. The animals were fed ad libitum on a silage-based ration before and during the experiment. Growth hormone was assayed in plasma from blood samples taken at −15, −5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min from stimulation. Plasma GH concentrations were log transformed before statistical analyses. Response variables were; PRIOR (mean of −15, −5 and 0 min samples) and PEAK (mean of 10, 15 and 20-min samples). In experiment B, 37 calves (19 H+18 L, 22 males and 15 females, age 114–259 days) were subjected daily to one of three intravenous stimulation tests (GRF, 0.10 and 0.50 μg/kg or thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) at 0.20 μg/kg live weight) on each of 3 consecutive days. Feeding was restricted to cover estimated maintenance requirements only. Rations were given once daily during the test days and 3 days prior to first test. Blood sampling and variables followed those of experiment A. Selection line did not significantly affect GH variables in experiments A or B at any dose of GRF or TRH. GH response increased with increasing dose of GRF up to 0.50 μg/kg. At the highest GRF dose, the response was delayed and persisted longer. Doses giving intermediate to large response increased repeatability of GH measurements. It is concluded that GH secretion in juvenile cattle can be accurately assessed using GRF based stimulation tests combined with restricted and controlled feeding, but it is not affected by selection for milk yield in Norwegian cattle.",

The piglets were housed pair-wise in pens and were fed semi-ad libitum. During feeding the piglets were separated allowing individual feeding within the pen. Four diets were tested with varying proportions of a high quality fish meal (F) and low-glycoalkaloid potato protein (P): diet A (10% F); diet B (5% F and 5% P); diet C (2.5% F and 7.5% P) and diet D (10% P). On average, in weeks 1–4, the piglets on diets C and D had higher feed intakes (17%; P<0.01) and daily weight gains (18%; P<0.05) than the piglets on diets A and B. There was no effect of diet (P>0.05) on feed conversion. It can be concluded from the present study that low-glycoalkaloid potato protein can completely replace high quality fish meal in diets for weaner pigs. The improved feed intake and daily gain with increasing inclusion suggests that low-glycoalkaloid potato protein may be superior to fish meal as a protein source for weaner pigs.",

A total of eight SSCPs patterns were detected in three of these exons in a sample of 50 Jakhrana goats, indicating that this breed has high genetic variability in the ALA gene. This result opens interesting prospects for future breeding programs and conservation strategies. These ALA gene variants can be sequenced and screened in the entire population to develop single nucleotide polymorphisms for association studies with different productive and reproductive performances and marker assisted selection. In addition, our data show that PCR–SSCP is an appropriate tool for evaluating genetic variability.",

Two statistical approaches were used; mean breed performance in extensive/intensive environments (mixed models), or as within breed regressions of cow performance on modelled cow energy intake. Aberdeen Angus produced higher weaning weight than Hereford below 12,000 MJ NE (241 kg) and Charolais below 13,000 MJ NE (244 kg) cow energy intake in the suckler period, after which the breeds re-ranked. The corresponding re-rank between Hereford and Charolais was at 14,500 MJ NE (263 kg) cow energy intake. Overall, breed by environment interactions were observed for calving interval, number/kg calves weaned/mated cow/year and energy efficiency, which emphasise that choice of cow breed should be dependent on the natural production resources available.",

We found that the lambs grew faster when grazing the mountain pasture. Spring and integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) affected only the lambs grazing in the mountains. Winter conditions (North Atlantic Oscillation) and summer temperature had a positive effect on growth in both pastures while spring temperature and spring NDVI were important only in the mountains. The positive effect of spring NDVI suggests that the mountain pasture will produce bigger lambs under future climate warming, while the lambs on the coastal pasture will be less affected.",

After the restricted feeding period, it was found that reduced intake of protein and energy or of protein alone had a significant effect on the proportion and diameter of fast-twitch glycolytic (FTG) fibres. After realimentation, no differences in muscle structure were found between the investigated groups of animals. Regardless of the feeding system, the growth of pigs was paralleled by hypertrophy of all muscle fibre types and their different transformation in the muscles.",

The entrance-exit gate eliminated displacements, but also discouraged some ewes from entering the EFS.

While there are many options to enhance profitability of dairy utilisation of local dual purpose cattle breeds, in some of them, for various reasons, milk utilisation is continuously declining and dairy herds are gradually transformed into less labour demanding suckling herds. However, sometimes there is no consensus among breeders and breeding organisations on dividing dual-purpose breeds into dairy and beef subpopulations. The paper examines the pros and cons of this approach using case studies from Poland, Norway and Austria. While there are disadvantages in turning a breed traditionally milked to beef production, sometimes it is the only valid option to continue its utilisation. Therefore, trade-offs need to be considered and conservation steps taken before starting the transformation of a breed.",

Cows were fed individually one of two diets (HSFM or LSFM) as TMR (total mixed ration) 21 d before expected calving. Prepartum dry matter intake increased significantly for cows fed HSFM diet. Cows on HSFM diet had more colostrum yield and produced more milk than did cows fed a LSFM diet only during the first week after calving. Energy-corrected milk production was higher for the cows fed HSFM. Milk compositions including fat, protein, and total solids were not affected by prepartum treatments. Plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose were not different between treatments. These data suggest that sunflower meal can improve prepartum dry matter intake and hence productive performance in early lactation.",

Digestibility of dietary organic matter (OM) by sheep fed at maintenance decreased by 3.5% as a result of maturation (silage mean 67%). In contrast, voluntary intake of OM increased by 5.5% from TD to MED (diet mean 28.5 g kg−1 body weight). The energetic feeding potential, calculated as intake of digestible OM, was not affected by stage of maturity. The main neutral cell wall sugars were β-glucose (23%) and xylose (12%) followed by arabinose (2%). The digestibilities of all cell wall fractions except β-glucose decreased with advancing maturity. The strongest effect was observed for mannose followed by arabinose, galactose and xylose. It is recommended to harvest barley for whole-crop silage at MED.",

By reparameterising in terms of canonical heritabilities and a transformation matrix, a six-dimensional problem is reduced to a two-dimensional problem. It is shown how to derive the estimate of the transformation matrix given the values for the canonical heritabilities. Maximization is then only over the two dimensions of canonical heritabilities and the transformation matrix.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aims of the present study were to investigate the relationship between sexual maturation, growth and carcass performance in gilts. The incidence of malformations of the genital organs at slaughter was also recorded. The study included 360 Swedish Yorkshire gilts slaughtered at 102 kg live weight from a selection experiment for lean tissue growth rate. Of the 325 gilts used in the analysis of carcass performance, 164 were immature, 104 prepuberal and 57 sexually mature according to their ovarian morphology. No significant differences in growth rate were found between the groups. The carcasses of the immature gilts had a significantly greater lean content, regardless of the measurement method used, than the carcasses of the sexually mature gilts. The carcasses of the prepuberal gilts ranked between these two groups. Malformations of the genital tracts were found in 51 gilts (14%).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of feeding intensity and protein source on growth, feed intake, slaughter and body measurements of 24 pre-pubertal Finnish Ayrshire heifers were studied. The heifers were fed a hay-barley diet supplemented with either urea or rapeseed meal (RSM). The treatments were: (1) LU, low feeding level+urea; (2) LR, low feeding level+RSM; (3) HU, high feeding level+urea; (4) HR, high feeding level+RSM. Hay was fed ad libitum on HU and HR diets but was restricted on LU and LR diets. The average initial weight of the heifers was 87 kg, and the final weight 220 kg. There was a significant interaction between feeding level and protein source for growth and feed intake measurements, but not for slaughter quality. Protein source had no impact on the daily gain on low feeding intensity (692 vs. 655 g/d). On high feeding intensity the heifers grew 890 g/d and 805 g/d (P <0.01) on the HR and HU diets, respectively. The carcass quality was not affected by the feeding level or protein source, but the heifers on LU and LR diets had bigger frame size at the live weight of 220 kg than heifers on HU and HR diets. The results suggest that on the low feeding level the quality of the protein was not critical for heifers weighing under 220 kg. However, on the high feeding level, the growth rate was increased when RSM was used instead of urea as protein supplement. Based on calculations done according to the Nordic protein evaluation system this is proposed to be due to the increased supply of absorbed amino acids with RSM compared to urea supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The portal recovery of SCFA (short‐chain fatty acids) infused intraruminally as a single load was investigated in sheep adapted to a hay (H) or a concentrate/straw (CS) diet. The treatments were control (saline), 1.4 mol and 2.4 mol of SCFA (in % 65:20:15 acetate, propionate and butyrate). Three rumen cannulated and multi‐catheterized sheep were used. Portal and arterial blood as well as rumen liquid was sampled during a period of 480 min following the loads. The PDV (portal‐drained viscera) metabolism of arterial acetate and the ILR (irreversible loss rate) of arterial acetate were estimated by intravenous infusion of sodium‐acetate [1‐13C]. The portal blood flow rate was measured using ultrasonic transit time flow probes. The portal blood flow rate increased by 60–70% following the intraruminal loads of SCFA compared with the preinfusion level. The portal recovery of arterial acetate increased to 0.84 ± 0.02 and 0.95 ± 0.01 in samples obtained 5 min after an intraruminal load of 1.4 or 2.4 mol SCFA, respectively. Arterial concentrations as high as 3.5, 1.0 and 0.7 mmol 1−1 of acetate, propionate and butyrate, respectively, were measured following the loads. The portal appearance of SCFA appeared to be down‐regulated during the period from 20–120 min following the load of 2.4 mol SCFA. The portal recovery of infused acetate and propionate decreased with increasing amounts of infused SCFA. Recoveries were estimated as 0.46 to 0.59 for acetate, 0.52 to 0.61 for propionate and 0.28 to 0.36 for butyrate. Only the recovery of acetate was affected by diet and the recovery increased (0.05 ± 0.02) when the sheep were adapted to the CS diet (P < 0.05). A model of the regulation of SCFA absorption from the rumen implicating a role of peripheral butyrate is discussed in the context of the results from the present study and from literature data.

The effects on mortality rate, liver fat content, liver weights, growth performance, plasma activities of alanine‐aminotransferase (ALAT), plasma concentrations of total protein, urea, creatinine and bile acids and haematocrit values were studied. The results showed that the mink has a high requirement of dietary protein besides essential amino acids, especially glucogenic amino acids. Feeding a low‐protein diet caused increased mortality rate, liver lipidosis, increased plasma activity of ALAT and reduced growth performance compared with control feeding. A dietary supplement of essential amino acids to the low‐protein diet did not improve the health status, but had a positive effect on growth performance compared with the unsupplemented low‐protein diet.",

C1 was a control group without any supplements and C2 a control group supplemented only with vitamin D 3 . Samples of inner organs were analysed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after 6 months of Cd exposure. A significant elevation in Cd levels, mainly in the liver and kidneys, was found. A significant decrease ( P h 0.01) in Cd levels in the liver was recorded after the addition of 6.0 mg CdCl 2 kg -1 body weight and vitamin D 3 , in comparison with the group without vitamin D 3 (18.76 vs. 10.33 mg kg -1 ). A similar decrease in Cd levels in the kidney ( P h 0.001) at the same supplementation dose of Cd was obtained in comparison with the group without vitamin D 3 (145.32 vs. 60.37 mg kg -1 ). The results confirmed that vitamin D 3 is able to reduce the Cd content in the organism of laying hens. The main effect of vitamin D 3 was demonstrated by decreasing Cd retention in the liver and especially in the kidneys. Keywords: CadmiumLaying HensRetentionVitamin D",

A considerable loss of dams' body weight, constituting 6.3% in group 1 and 8.1% in group 2, was noticed on the day after weaning, indicating a greatly reduced food consumption on the day of weaning. No changes in plasma aldosterone and no significant decrease in urinary sodium concentration were seen in dams after removal from their litters, whereas, irrespective of time of weaning, urinary sodium and chloride concentrations were halved a few days after weaning compared with the other group. The plasma cortisol concentration was high before and during weaning and was nearly halved 1 week after weaning, implying less strain on the dams after weaning. It is concluded that the weaning period is a most vulnerable and stressful period to the dams irrespective of the actual time of weaning.",

In total, 141 pigs were included from the three genetic groups Norwegian Landrace (lean and efficient), Duroc and Landrace 2 LP (a fat and slow-growing selection line) (LLP). Individual feed consumption was registered, and detailed body composition measured repeatedly by computed tomography. Energy consumption [MJ metabolizable energy (ME) day -1 ] did not differ between the genetic groups. In general, about 40-50% of consumed energy was partitioned to growth. The genetic groups partitioned equal proportions of daily energy consumption to growth (ME GROWTH ) and maintenance (MEm) early and late in the growth period. From 50 to 85 kg body weight Landrace partitioned more to growth and less to maintenance compared with Duroc ( P <0.05). When considering partitioning of ME above maintenance, the genetically fat LLP had the highest net energy retention relative to the heat increment of feeding and was therefore the most efficient, Duroc was in an intermediate position while the lean Landrace had the lowest proportion. The partitioning of ME GROWTH to fatty tissue and carcass lean growth differed between the genetic groups ( P <0.001) according to genetic potential for carcass lean and fatty tissue gain. Increasing proportions were partitioned to fatty tissue growth with increasing body weight. The genetic groups partitioned equal proportions of ME GROWTH to non- fat visceral components (NFVC) growth. MEm varied between 0.65 and 0.68 MJ kg -0.75 day -1 . MEm increased with increasing weight of carcass lean and viscera ( P <0.01), more so in the modern breeds than in the LLP. Keywords: Component GrowthEnergy PartitioningGenetic DifferencesPigs",

The relationship between total methane (CH4) production predicted by Karoline model and that estimated from empirical equation (='observed'), showed that Karoline model over-predicted CH4 production by 30 L/d (P<0.01) with the mean bias having the greatest contribution (59%) of mean squared prediction error (MSPE). The proportion of random error of MSPE was 40%, whereas the contribution of linear bias was small and non-significant (P = 0.11). The residuals were significantly related to dietary crude protein (CP) concentration.

The breeding goal traits were: net income per year of productive life and lifetime income divided by cost. The early economic index traits were: net income per year and income divided by cost, measured during the first lactation or the first 15 months of productive life. Economic traits were calculated on the basis of production, fertility, and disease data on around 10000 cows having an opportunity to produce for at least 5 years. Variance-covariance components were estimated by applying a multiple-trait restricted maximum likelihood procedure to a sire model. The heritability estimates were around 40% for yield in 1st lactation, 20–30% for the early economic measures, and 10–15% for lifetime income/cost. Genetic correlation estimates with lifetime income/cost were 0.75–0.9 for early economic measures, and 0.6–0.7 for 1st and 2nd lactation yields. The annual genetic gain in lifetime economic performance was greater with selection on only 1st lactation yields than when the generation interval was extended to include 120-day yields in 2nd lactation. However, selection on the various early economic measures was up to 12% better than selection on only 1st lactation yields. A potential problem with a positive bias in the estimated correlation between early and lifetime performance exists. This bias is caused by the effect of milk yield on longevity, mediated through the management system.",

Only 5 of the 8 anti-SS calves formed significant amounts of antibodies, with an average binding capacity of 24–34 picomole SS per litre plasma and an antibody affinity (K D) of 0.20 ± 0.04 nM. No difference was found in daily gain (1454 vs. 1378 g, SEM = 71) although voluntary daily energy intake of concentrates was slightly higher (P = 0.17) in anti-SS calves (6.09 vs. 5.54 Scandinavian Feed Units, SEM = 0.27).

Plasma levels of somatotropin and insulin were not altered by immunization. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was elevated in anti-SS calves following the 4th immunization (301 vs. 259 ng/ml, SEM = 13). The increased plasma IGF-I concentration is most likely a result of increased feed intake. However, a change in IGF-I secretion from liver cells owing to change in concentration of free SS is another possibility. The increased fat deposition also argues against involvement of ST.

    "abstract": "Abstract The study was conducted using about 93 000 records from the Swedish Sheep Recording Scheme (SRS) during the years 1983, 1985 and 1987. Fleece characteristics studied were: colour of fleece, size of curl, scores for colour, curl distribution and firmness, quality of hair and hair density. Litter size and age of lamb at assessment influenced almost all the fleece traits, and this was consistent over the years. The heritabilities of the fleece characteristics varied between 0.11 and 0.62. No genetic relationships were found between lamb weight at assessment and fleece characteristics. Breeding for heavier lambs can therefore be done without impairing the fleece quality. No unfavourable genetic correlations between the fleece traits were found. The results suggest that the reliability of the fleece inspection from a genetic point of view has not changed much over the last 20 years, although the fleece characteristics have been improved considerably during this period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to create operational replacement guidelines under various conditions concerning reproductive performance, supply of replacement heifers and individual milk yield. Nine culling strategies were defined by three average insemination periods and by three discrimination policies between high- and low-yield cows. The effect of the nine culling strategies was analysed with combinations of heat detection rate and time of initiation of breeding after calving under two replacement heifer purchase policies: purchase (open herd) and no purchase (closed herd). The strategies were evaluated using a stochastic simulation model that simulated production and reproductive status in herds composed of dual-purpose cattle with additional young stock. The evaluation of the strategies was made in a situation without a milk quota under typical Danish conditions in 1993. Results showed that discriminating between high- and low-yield cows improved net revenue significantly in open herds but not in closed herds. Irrespective of the purchase policy, using longer insemination periods increased net revenue significantly in herds with poor reproductive performance; whereas net revenue in herds with good reproductive performance tended to increase by using shorter insemination periods. The culling rate is a poor figure when evaluating culling strategies and culling strategies should be assessed at herd level rather than per cow.",

Further, lower dietary lysine levels resulted in higher drip loss of the meat compared with high dietary levels (5.3% vs 4.8%). Mixing of unfamiliar pigs prior to slaughter led to meat with lower internal reflectance values (28.3 vs 32.2) and glucose+G-6-P concentrations of the meat juice (46.3 vs 49.7 μmol/ml) compared with pen-wise slaughtering. In comparison with non-carriers, RN − carriers had significantly lower ultimate pH, shear force values and water-holding capacity. Mixing of non-carrier pigs prior to slaughter gave higher Napole yield compared with those handled pen-wise. Females had lower ultimate pH and higher Napole yield compared with entire males.",

The data set was used to examine the influence of age and classifier on genetic parameters of foot and leg traits by treating traits recorded at two different times or by two different people as a different characteristic in a bivariate analysis. The general incidence of foot and leg diseases was very low in young animals: only interdigital dermatitis, heel necrosis and solar bruising showed a frequency higher than 2% in 10-month-old bulls. The same traits measured on different claws yielded very high genetic correlations (rg 0.77-0.98), suggesting that the number of measurements could be reduced. Hooves increased in size with age, and the genetic correlation between the two age classes was high (rg 0.60-0.77). The agreement between classifiers was very high for objectively measured traits, especially for the younger age class, and interdigital dermatitis and heel necrosis, but inconclusive for the subjectively scored characteristics.",

Fifty-four pigs (Duroc) were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments: WCR at levels of 0 (control), 10 or 20%, respectively. Pigs were fed from about 29 to 85 kg. A digestion trial was conducted with all pigs at about 60 kg live weight. When the feeding trial was completed, six pigs from each treatment were slaughtered to determine carcass quality. In the growing period, pigs receiving the 10 or 20% WCR diet were not significantly different in daily feed intake, daily weight gain and feed conversion from the control pigs (p>0.05). In the finishing period, daily feed intake and daily weight gain of pigs fed the 20% WCR diet were significantly lower than control pigs or 10% WCR diet (p<0.05). However, the feed conversion was not significantly different among the pigs on three different diets. No significant (p>0.05) difference was shown in the apparent nutrient digestibility with the WCR substituting for wheat by-products. The dressing percentage and mean backfat thickness tended to be lower in pigs fed the 10 or 20% WCR diet than in control pigs. The meat from pigs on the 20% WCR diet showed a higher pH value at 24 h post mortem, and higher protein and lower fat content in longissimus muscles than control pigs (p<0.05). This study indicated that WCR could be an alternative feed source to replace wheat by-products in growing-finishing pig diets, but a high proportion of the WCR may result in an adverse effect on the performance traits.",

The test was optimised for broiler chickens and evaluated in a stress model in which plasma corticosterone levels were increased by the administration of 0.5 or 2 mg corticosterone/chicken/day. Keyhole limpet haemocyanin evoked a hypersensitivity type IV response, which was sensitive to increased plasma corticosterone levels. However, the inhibitory effect of 0.5 mg corticosterone/chicken/day was not significantly different from the solvent control (ethanol), because of an inhibitory effect of ethanol itself. The inhibitory effect of 2 mg corticosterone/chicken/day was mainly due to an effect on female chickens, indicating a difference in corticosterone sensitivity between gender. Our data indicate that the delayed type hypersensitivity test against keyhole limpet haemocyanin was sensitive for increased plasma corticosterone concentrations. Therefore this may be an easy and useful test for measuring cell-mediated immunity in corticosterone related immune-suppressed broiler chickens.",

The dataset included 48,946 Dala lambs and 38,299 Spæl lambs. The breed by environment interaction affected lamb autumn weights, and though Dala lambs were always heavier, the difference was substantially smaller at lower than at higher production levels: 1 kg increase in production level was related to Dala lambs’ weights increasing 0.09 kg more than the Spæl lambs’ weights.

An internet-based questionnaire was sent out to dairy farmers connected to the Norwegian co-operative breeding organization Geno (N = 8222), of which 10.8% answered (N = 888). Of the 15 suggested traits fertility had the highest overall ranking, while parasite resistance and methane emission had the lowest. Four distinct preference clusters were identified by the means of cluster analysis, of which two had a high preference for milk production. Differences in terms of farm and herd characteristics between clusters suggests a mixture of systematic and intrinsic effects on breeding goal trait priorities. This study shows that Norwegian dairy farmers' preferences for breeding goal traits fall into four distinct clusters, both affected by herd and farm characteristics along with intrinsic values.",

Quality evaluations (number of bacteria, acidity and oxidation of fat, sensoric quality) indicated that instant cooling/continuous process compared with normal cooling/batch process over 2.5 hours, both to 4°C, resulted in a slightly slower bacterial growth and a slightly slower hydrolysis and oxidation of milk fat. Instant raw milk cooled and stored at 2.5°C maintained a good quality for about one to two days more than when normal cooling over 1.5 hours and storing at 4°C was used.",

The quality of silages produced in open‐drainage silos and closed‐drainage silos was also compared. Silage and effluent were fed ad libitum with concentrate supplements. Animals readily consumed effluent at 30 kg day−1 on average, equivalent to 2.2 kg dry matter (DM) day−1. Silage intakes decreased by 1 kg DM day−1 when silage plus effluent was fed as compared with silage alone, while total roughage intake (silage plus effluent) increased by 1.2 kg DM day−1. Milk yields and fat, protein, and lactose contents tended to increase for cows receiving effluent. Increases in milk yield were small, however, relative to the increases in DM intake, indicating reduced feed conversion efficiency when effluent was fed. Intakes of silage stored in the presence of effluent tended to be lower than those of silage from which effluent had been drained, but milk yield and milk composition were unaffected.

By October, over 90% of the boxes were scored as acceptable. Fur quality tended to be lower in nest box groups, due to staining from faeces and urine. Use of the nest boxes seemed to depend more on the individual animal rather than its species. Three individuals (out of 20) accounted for almost one half (48%) of the total use, while the 12 least enthusiastic users accounted for less than 5% of the total use (as assessed by video recording). The enthusiastic users were mainly in the box at night. In the feeding and disturbance tests, more individuals from the nest box groups showed fear‐related reactions. A transparent front wall did not reduce the number of timid individuals. Fearfulness resulting from nest box history is a negative feature from both practical and animal welfare points of view.",

Both beef and milk production traits are included in the total merit index used for selection, and estimates of genetic and phenotypic parameters of these traits are therefore of interest for an optimal construction of such indices. Data on first lactation milk records from the field and beef records of potential dairy breeding bulls from the Danish performance test stations were analysed in bivariate animal-sire models using the AI-REML algorithm. Genetic correlations of 0.16, 0.25 and 0.43 between feed intake capacity and protein yield were obtained for Red Danish (RD), Danish Black and White (DBW) and Danish Jersey (DJ), respectively. These correlations were significantly different from zero for the two populations (DBW and DJ). Genetic correlations around zero between feed efficiency and protein yield were obtained for all three populations. Genetic correlations of 0.44, 0.19 and 0.47 between average daily gain and protein yield were obtained for RD, DBW and DJ, respectively. The genetic correlations between protein yield and muscle area was close to zero for DBW, while it was -0.31 for RD. Selection index calculations indicate that indices composed of different beef performance traits can be used as early predictors for milk yield. Selection on such an index could increase the breeding value of the young bulls for milk production traits by 0.8-2.0% of the population mean.",

Five multiparous sows were fitted with two catheters, in the cranial epigastric artery and anterior mammary vein. Catheterization of the cranial epigastric artery was carried out with a new surgical technique. Implanted catheters remained functional until day 15 (in two animals), day 21 (one animal) and day 27 (one animal), whereas in one case this technique failed. Sampling of arterial and venous blood took place on days 9, 15, 21 and 27 of lactation. Mean extraction rates - SEM (percent) were 31.2 - 3.1 arginine (Arg), 16.4 - 2.5 glutamine (Gln), 27.2 - 5.7 threonine (Thr), 8.3 - 2.6 glycine (Gly), 12.4 - 2.7 alanine (Ala), 20.2 - 3.4 tyrosine (Tyr), 18.1 - 2.8 proline (Pro), 28.2 - 6.2 methionine (Met), 18.5 - 2.2 valine (Val), 26.4 - 3.1 phenylalanine (Phe), 30.2 - 3.1 isoleucine (Ile), 41.4 - 3.4 leucine (Leu), 32.2 - 4.0 lysine (Lys) and 20.0 - 2.76 glucose. There was a relatively high abundance of lysine in milk compared with the amount extracted from plasma. This suggests lysine to be limiting in the present experimental situation, which was probably due to a low feed intake only providing 31.4 g Lys day -1 on average. Mean mammary plasma flow (litres plasma day -1 ), evaluated by use of Lys, Met and calcium as markers in the metabolic Fick principle, amounted to 7869 - 989 Lys, 6391 - 2139 Met and 4059 - 747 calcium. The large difference in the results implies that there is a need for other markers to measure the mammary plasma flow or novel methods based on other principles to measure mammary plasma flow, which is an important factor in quantitative studies of daily mammary uptake of nutrients.

    "abstract": "Abstract A new method for likelihood-based inference of fixed effects in mixed linear models, with variance components treated as nuisance parameters, is presented. The method uses uniform-integration of the likelihood; the implementation employs the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for elimination of all nuisances, viewing random effects and variance components as missing data. In a simulation of a grazing trial, the procedure was compared with four widely used estimators of fixed effects in mixed models, and found to be competitive. An analysis of body weight in freshwater crayfish was conducted to illustrate the feasibility of the methodology in a real situation. The method is a useful non-Bayesian alternative to maximum likelihood and estimated generalized least-squares, as it accounts for nuisance variances.

First, I summarize what has been the current trend in QTL search. The type of DNA polymorphism and the statistical techniques used have varied over the last two decades. The initial emphasis on linkage analysis using microsatellites, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), or amplified random-length polymorphism (AFLPs) and standard statistical techniques has been substituted by a recent focus in massive single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies where coalescence theory has a preeminent role. Then, I focus on new statistical approaches that are being developed (or should be). In particular, a unified framework that combines coalescence and mixed-model theory is badly needed. I finally emphasize the relevance of modelling in emerging experiments like genetical genomics approaches.",

A new panel of 101 selectively neutral SNP sites was used to interrogate genetic variation in 192 individuals sampled from 13 putatively distinctive population units. Individuals partitioned into K = 11 genetic clusters characterized by high levels of genetic diversity, strong patterns of genetic structure and low levels of inbreeding.

    "abstract": "To evaluate dietary addition of soybean oil (SBO) on growth, rumen fermentation, carcass and meat traits, 21 male Rambouillet lambs (2.5-mo-old and weighing 18 ± 1.45 kg) were distributed randomly to a diet with 0, 25 or 50 g SBO/kg dry matter. Trial lasted 60 d. Dietary SBO did not affect growth, carcass traits or muscle conformation. Energy intake, dorsal fat and fatness degree, as well as rumen pH, acetate and acetate:propionate ratio had a linear increment (P < .05) with larger amounts of SBO in the diet. Also, increased SBO levels in the diet linearly augmented (P < .05) meat brightness (L*), muscle fat content and C18:1 t11 and C18:2 proportion. Dietary SBO at 50 g/kg DM for finishing lambs may be a feeding option to reduce the amount of energy from grains in the diet and favour deposition of fatty acids in meat that can benefit consumer health.",

The more extensive animal science education, the less prone animal welfare inspectors were to give higher body condition scores. Students had a higher overall probability of rating the degree of soiling higher than the animal welfare inspectors and veterinarians/advisers. Students also recommended stricter corrective actions than did welfare inspectors and veterinarians/advisers, and veterinarians/advisers recommended less strict actions than animal welfare inspectors.",

Data from 196 feeding experiments with dairy cows, and 17 experiments of periodical data, and 135 experiments of complete data with growing cattle were used in the evaluation by mixed model regression. The feed intake by both dairy cows and growing cattle were overestimated by the models. A linear bias indicated that over prediction increased with level of intake both by dairy cows and growing cattle. Most animal and diet factors were significantly related to the residuals, which indicated that those factors did not act independently in the predictions of feed intake. This kind of errors can restrict future ration formulation and animal performance, since animal production parameters included in the prediction models will be a consequence of the diet fed at the time they were measured.Keywords: Cattledairy cowmeta-analysismetabolicphysicalprediction modelsvoluntary intake AcknowledgmentThe authors acknowledge the Regional Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research in Northern Sweden (RJN) for financial support of the project.",

Three flooring locations (Alley, Concrete and Mat) and four behaviors (lying lateral, lying sternal, sitting and standing) were recorded. Sows increased Mat frequency and decreased Alley frequency on day +1 (most lame) relative to day −1. Lying lateral frequency increased, whereas lying sternal and standing frequencies decreased between day −1 and day +1. Sows appear to prefer the Mat within 24 h following lameness induction. Lying lateral is likely a more comfortable position than standing or lying sternal in these lame sows. In conclusion, these behaviors may be reliable indicators to further ascertain if a sow is lame.",

    "abstract": "A profit function was developed to estimate economic values for new efficiency traits for fattening pigs in Norwegian Landrace. These traits were lean meat efficiency (LME) and fat efficiency (FE). LME and FE described how much feed the animal used to produce 1 kg lean meat and fat as a deviation from the mean. Both traits were derived from analysing total feed consumption in a random regression model which included lean meat and fat content of the carcass (FC) as random covariates. In addition, economic values and breeding values were calculated for days from 40 to 100/120 kg live weight (DAYS), lean meat percentage (LMP) and FC. To compare LME and FE with total feed intake (FI), two indexes were constructed. One index included LME, FE, DAYS, LMP and FC and was referred to as breeding goal A and one index included FI, LMP and DAYS and was referred to as breeding goal B. The standardized economic values for LME and FE were 8.9 and 2.9 EUR/σa, respectively. There was a larger variation in the index for breeding goal A (SD = 5.65) than B (SD = 3.97). The results suggested that the two efficiency traits had an economic importance in pork production and that there was a potential for increased genetic gain in profit by using breeding goal A compared to breeding goal B.",

Quality grade was higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3 than in C, and the ratio of high-quality grades was higher in treatment groups than in C.

The CP ranged from 51.41 to 156.09 g/kg DM, which was especially high within M. sativa and low in H. vulgare. O. ficus indica had the highest values in free condensed tannins. The most digestible plant sample was that from M. sativa and O.ficus indica. The maximum in vitro gas production was recorded with M. sativa and H. vulgare. The same trend was observed with the total gas production (144 h).

The urinary marker concentrations were strongly and positively associated with each other, and both correlated strongly and negatively with total urine volume. Creatinine excretion and chromium recovery did not vary according to diets, but chromium recovery exhibited a lower variance among animals. The evaluation of urine spot samples showed that sampling time affects both markers, with the lowest urinary concentrations obtained when samples were taken early in the morning. Both creatinine and the Cr-EDTA complex produce similar estimates of urine volume. However, despite the greater precision of the estimates obtained with chromium, the values obtained with creatinine exhibited less bias and are, therefore, more accurate.",

    "abstract": "Livestock death and disease are considered to be one of the main factors contributing to poverty in India which can be minimized by insuring the animals. An attempt is made to study livestock insurance schemes and their constraints. From each district of Tamil Nadu, 30 insured farmers who insured their animals were selected by a simple random sampling procedure, i.e. a total of 930 beneficiaries. The majority of them had covered only 1–2 of their dairy cows under the National Livestock Mission (NLM), whereas only 9.90% of the sample respondents` had applied for compensation. In the year 2014–2015, a total number of 29,539 cattle were insured for which an amount of Rs. 13,009,231 was spent under NLM. A similar pattern existed during the period 2016–2017 and 2017–2018. The claim ratio was less than 3%. The claim amount settlement data indicated that in 2014–2015 Rs. 13,612,405 amount was settled which had increased to Rs. 20,093,002 in 2015–2016 and to Rs. 18,695,765 in 2016–2017 and Rs. 15,656421 in the year 2017–2018. The study indicated that the majority of animals (57.62%) have died of metabolic diseases followed by infectious diseases (17.05) and 22.23% of the claims were due to various other diseases. Nonavailability of veterinarians was considered the first and foremost technical constraint and the high premium amount was considered the first and foremost financial constraint. The factors like the number of adult animals, the age of the farmer and the system of rearing were found to be significantly influencing the constraint score given by the farmer. The study concluded that for the scheme to be successful, the first thing to do is to make prompt settlements within a stipulated time period say 60–90 days which would create a positive impact, and the implementation mechanism has to be simpler, hassle-free and prompt to make it successful. Also, steps to make the livestock insurance services available at the doorsteps of the farmers would bring more and more farmers under the ambit of the scheme.",

A preliminary descriptive analysis of the fecundity and early embryo survival identified substantial differences in favor of G0 (year class 2016) which was partly explained by the fact that first-time 3-year-old spawners were used in G1 (year class 2019). Moderate to high heritability values (0.23–0.49) were obtained for body length and weight across both time points and generations. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the estimated breeding values was ∼0.65, while the expected genetic gain was 36 g per year. Overall, our results demonstrate the positive performance of the Swedish rainbow trout breeding program.",

Collected grass samples were subjected to nutrient and in-vitro dry matter digestibility analysis. The cultivars and harvesting stages influenced (P < 0.05) the nutrient composition, dry matter intake (DMI), invitro dryy matter digestibility (IVDMD), relative feed value (RFV), and total digestible nutrients (TDN) of grasses. There was an interaction between the cultivars and harvesting intervals on acid detergent lignin (ADL), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), K/Ca + Mg, copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn).

Landrace Finewool, a more prolific breed, peaked at 5 and 6 years of age and started to decline the year after. Flock size in itself did not significantly affect LS for any breed. The addition of an effect of flock-year increased the coefficient of determination (R 2) in a linear model. SAS Proc CATMOD estimated noticeable differences between LS distributions for different breeds and ewe ages, and smaller differences between LS distributions for individual ewe deviations from flock average lambing date. It was concluded that the effects of flock-year and age of ewe were the major fixed effects that need to be accounted for when evaluating LS within breed.",

Significant effect of breed was observed for all measures of response, with Red Danish and Danish Red & White having higher values than Danish Jersey and Danish Friesian. Variance/covariance components were estimated for effects of service sire, permanent environment (donor) and additive genotype (donor). Additive genotype did contribute significantly to the phenotypic variance of all quantitative measures of response. Heritabilities of 0.31 ± 0.06 and 0.22 ± 0.07 were found for number of ova and number of transferable embryos, respectively, when non-responders were excluded. If non-responders were included, heritabilities dropped to 0.25 ± 0.06 and 0.15 ± 0.05 for number of ova and number of transferable embryos, respectively. It is argued that systematic use of su-perovulation in cattle breeding programmes might lead to an increase in the frequency of spontaneous multiple births, owing to a genetic change in ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins.

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of level and degradability of rapeseed meal on ration digestibility, N balance, urinary purine derivatives excretion, milk production and milk composition in dairy cows were studied. A total of 24 multiparous lactating diary cows were selected from a production experiment and divided into two 12-cow groups according to their lactation stage (LG1, 14th-16th week of lactation; and LG2, 26th-30th week of lactation). Within lactation groups, cows were fed four different rations (3 cows per treatment). Four concentrate mixtures with two levels of protein (19% and 14% of CP on DM basis) and two different rumen degradabilities (72% and 52%) of the dominating protein feed rapeseed meal were fed to the cows together with pasture silage and hay. Apparent total tract digestibilities were not affected by the treatments. N balance was positive and similar between diets in both lactation groups. N partition data were similar between treatments on LG1, while on LG2 a tendency for a more efficient use of the dietary N was detected on lower protein degradability diets. Urinary excretion of purine derivatives remained unaffected by the treatments in LG1, but was higher in cows fed low-protein degradability diets on LG2 associated with a higher DM intake. A positive correlation was observed, in both lactation groups, between urinary purine derivative excretion and digestible organic matter intake. Milk production tended to increase with increasing protein intake in LG1, and with increasing DM intake in LG2. Milk composition was not significantly affected by the diets in any of the lactation groups.",

Each year, three diets containing fatty herring scrap and three diets containing fatty mackerel, supplying 30, 50 or 70% of the dietary fat were compared with a control diet supplying only 20% of dietary fat as marine fat. In one of the experiments, another three groups were fed 12, 23 or 32% of defatted herring scrap in the diet. Each experimental group consisted of ∼75 male Scanglow mink kits. The energy content of the feed was 8.5 MJ kg-1 and there was ∼360 g crude protein per kg dry matter in all diets. When supplying up to a level of 50% of the fat from marine fat, the same or better weight gain, pelt length and fur quality in male mink kits were found compared with the control group. Increasing the proportion of dietary fat from herring scrap or mackerel up to 70% reduced both pelt length and fur quality compared with inclusion of 50% marine fat. Defatted herring scrap resulted in good pelt length and fur quality compared with the control group when used in proportions up to 32% of the diet, and the product is a good alternative feedstuff for mink feed.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the role of IGF‐1 in the galactopoietic effect of somatotropin, the partition of plasma IGF‐1 between groups of binding proteins (BP) was studied in goats at different stages of pregnancy, lactation and somatotropin treatment. By size‐exclusion chromatography, total plasma IGF‐1 was divided into a 150 kDa class and a 35 kDa class. Lactation was associated with marked reduction in plasma concentrations of IGF‐1, specifically of the 150 kDa class. During lactation, BP3 concentrations were also low and BP3 circulated mainly in a “free”; or non‐complex bound form. Somatotropin treatment changed IGF‐1 concentration and distribution towards that seen in pregnancy. It is concluded that the change in distribution of IGF‐1 and its binding protein at the start of lactaion means increased turnover of IGF‐1 and probably increased availability of IGF‐1 to mammary cells and other target tissues. The observed changes may be important aspects of the homeorhetic adaptation to lactation.",

    "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to investigate how silage intake, ewe weight gains, lambing performance and floor wastage of feed were affected by ad libitum silage feeding systems differing with respect to feeder space allowance, feeding frequency and feeder design. In Experiment 1, 162 ewes of the Icelandic sheep breed were divided into three treatments. Feeding twice a day in a conventional feeder type (A) for loose silage with 0.40 m feeder space per animal (Treatment 1-1) was compared with feeding whole round bales in a new feeder type (B) with an average space of 0.11 m per animal, and also with two different leftover allowances at feeding: approximately 5 and 15% in Treatments 1-2 and 1-3, respectively. In Experiment 2, 168 ewes of the Icelandic sheep breed were divided into three treatments. Treatment 2-1 was as Treatment 1-1 in Experiment 1, but here it was compared with feeding round bales cut in half in a third type (C) of feeder, with two different levels of feeder space allowance: average 0.11 m (Treatment 2-2) and 0.09 m (Treatment 2-3) per ewe. In Experiment 1, no significant differences in ewe weight gains or lambing performance were found between treatments. However, the silage intake was, on average, 10 and 20% higher in Treatments 1-2 and 1-3, respectively, than in Treatment 1-1. In Experiment 2, ewe weight gains differed significantly (P<0.05) between treatments, being 13.1, 11.5 and 9.6 for Treatments 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3, respectively, which parallels the trend found for intake in the treatments. The feed wastage on the floor was about 0, 4-5 and 1% for feeders A, B and C, respectively. It is concluded that when ewes are fed round bale silage ad libitum, continuous access feeding regimes with restricted feeder space allowance can be an interesting alternative, especially on farms where labour is a limiting factor on productivity.",

In 1994, the plasma concentrations of insulin were also investigated. The objectives of the study were to describe the daily ME consumption and the plasma concentrations of T3, T4 and insulin during lactation and to evaluate the factors that influence ME consumption, and the concentrations of T3, T4 and insulin. The factors included were dam age, dam body weight, litter size and litter weight. The daily consumption was recorded from 72 dams in 85 lactations. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals. Dam body weights were recorded before blood sampling and at days 14, 28, and 42 post partum. Kit body weights were recorded at parturition, and at days 14, 28, and 42 post partum. Between the first and the fourth weeks post partum, there was a steady increase in daily ME consumption from 1095 kJ to 1796 kJ. During the fifth week of lactation, the concentrations of T3 and T4 and insulin were low. In adult dams, ME consumption and concentration of T3 were lower than in yearlings. Litter weight had a greater influence on dam ME consumption than the number of kits. The results imply that in the lactation period a heavy demand is put on the mink dam. Despite the increase in ME consumption during lactation, the body weight loss of the dams indicates that they mobilize body reserves, especially in the final part of lactation. During the fourth week of lactation, the dams reach an upper limit for feed consumption. Insufficient feed consumption, and the increased milk production were associated with low concentrations of T3, T4 and insulin.",

    "abstract": "Pre-pubertal (86-220 kg BW) Finnish Ayrshire heifers were used to study the effect of feeding level and nitrogen source on GH, IGF-I, and prolactin (PRL) receptors in mammary and liver parenchymal tissue. The heifers were fed a hay-barley diet supplemented with either urea or rapeseed meal. The treatments were: (1) LU, low feeding level+urea; (2) LR, low feeding level+rapeseed meal; (3) HU, high feeding+urea; (4) HR, high feeding level+rapeseed meal. The average daily gains of the heifers on LU, LR, HU and HR diets were 692, 655, 805 and 890 g. At slaughter, mammary and liver parenchymal tissue was collected for preparation of crude membranes, and ligand-binding assays were performed. Specific binding of bGH to mammary membranes could not be detected. Linear Scatchard plots were obtained showing the presence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites for IGF-I in mammary tissue. Specific binding of IGF-I to mammary membranes was unaffected by feeding level and nitrogen source. Furthermore, Scatchard analysis showed unchanged binding capacities and binding affinities of the IGF-I receptors in mammary tissue from low and high fed heifers. Specific binding of prolactin to mammary membranes was increased by high feeding level (P<0.02) and by rapeseed meal (P<0.01). No interaction between feeding level and nitrogen source was identified. Hepatic binding of bGH, IGF-I and prolactin was unaffected by feeding level and nitrogen source. However, specific binding of prolactin tended to be lower (P<0.07) in liver tissue from heifers fed rapeseed meal as diet nitrogen source. The present study shows that the previously reported negative effect of high feeding level on pubertal mammary development (Mäntysaari et al., 1995), cannot be explained by changes in binding to GH and IGF-I receptors. The importance of the increase in prolactin binding to mammary membranes from heifers at high feeding level and with rapeseed meal needs further investigation.",

An arginine supply of 2.2% of DM (8.0 g/16 g N) resulted in minimum urinary excretion of orotic acid and a supply of 1.7% of DM (6.4 g/16 g N) prevented increased plasma concentrations of NH3.

We hypothesized the existence of a threshold weight below which lambing either does not occur, or the probability of lambing is very low. We also expected heavier females to have higher probabilities of successful lambing. Using mixed-effects logistic regression analyses, we observed spatio-temporal variability in lambing success of primiparous sheep. The proportion of primiparous females giving birth between 1993 and 1999 varied from 87.4 to 92.75% (mean=91%) and from 82.02 to 90.53% (mean=87%) in Buskerud and Nordland, respectively. As expected, higher autumn weight increased the probability of lambing in the first year of life, even after accounting for the random variability between year and farm. We were unable to find a threshold weight necessary for successful lambing, probably as a result of varying management practices. We conclude that juvenile weight before oestrus is, among others, a good predictor of the probability of successful lambing in primiparous sheep.",

Variation in TLR3 may alter host immune response to dsRNA, as suggested by studies on other TLRs in humans and livestock. Here, the genetic variation in the coding sequence of porcine TLR3 gene was explored in animals belonging to western commercial and Chinese indigenous pig populations. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including four non-synonymous, were identified. Two non-synonymous fell in ligand binding region and potentially alter specificity of pathogen recognition. The 8 SNPs were found in 15 haplotypes, one of which segregated at high frequency in the whole sample. Departure from neutrality analysis highlighted the fact that demographic factors strongly influence the test. These data provide novel, informative genetic markers for future disease association studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Genotype by environment (G×E) interaction effects influence phenotypic expressions of a trait and may be of importance for sheep breeding. Interaction effects are more likely to be present when there are large environmental differences. Norwegian sheep usually graze mountain or forest pastures during summer. In this study, we estimate G×E interactions in Norwegian White Sheep as genetic correlation between area-specific traits (autumn lamb weight) in three ram circles located in two different counties; two in Buskerud in the south and one in Troms to the north of the country. Using data from the National Sheep Recording System, a bivariate animal model was fitted and genetic correlations for each trait were obtained. None of the correlations were significantly different from unity indicating the absence of G×E interaction effect for weaning weight. To gain further insight, studies should include a breeding-goal level aggregation of all traits thought to contribute to profitability.

A total of 120 male broilers (n = 30 birds/treatment) were fed four diets supplemented with 0%, 0.1%, and 1.0% sea urchin shell powder or 1% feed additives. The use of sea urchin shell powder and feed additives improved growth performance compared to the controls. When compared with the control group at four weeks, ammonia fluxes were decreased by 29.2%, 37.6%, and 27.9% for 0.1% and 1.0% sea urchin shell powder and 1% feed additives, respectively, which could be due to the reduced litter pH. The addition of 1% sea urchin shell powder was effective in improving growth and reducing negative environmental impacts. It is suggested that the decrease in the ammonia level was mainly related to the lower litter pH.",

Breast muscle total selenium concentration was significant decreased (P=0.007) in the SO compared to RO and LNO dietary groups, while no differences were observed for antiradical power, glutathione peroxidise values or sensory evaluation for the three groups. LNO resulted in an almost five times lower ratio between arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid and a three times lower n-6/n-3 ratio compared to the SO group. These results indicate that dietary fatty acid composition may affect broiler meat total selenium concentration and suggest that a lowered n-6/n-3 ratio and increased level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in broiler meat may increase total selenium in meat.",

The experiment included 100 female turkeys from each of two commercial lines, BUT9 and BIG6, which, after the 6th week of rearing, were randomly divided into two groups: the control (C) and the extensive (E), with five replications in each. In the 7th week of life, birds from the E groups were transferred to a building with an open access to runs. All birds were given balanced diets appropriate to their age. Birds from the E group were fed the balanced diets diluted with crushed wheat in various proportions and were additionally given green fodder and steamed potatoes. During the experiment, the production effects of birds: body weight gain, feed conversion ratio and survival rate were registered. Turkeys were slaughtered after 16 weeks of rearing. Before slaughter, blood samples were collected for haematological and serum biochemical indices determination. The European efficiency factor, protein conversion ratio and the mean cost of feeding were calculated. Significantly smaller body weight gains were observed in the heavier line in treatment E, suggesting the lighter birds may be more useful for the extensive rearing system. This fact could show better usefulness of middle heavy turkeys for the extensive rearing system. The influence of the rearing system on haematological parameters of turkey blood, demonstrated by a bigger number of red blood cells and the decrease of mean corpuscular volume in the blood of experimental birds, was stated. As well as the rearing conditions influenced level of aspartate, total protein and glucose; their level was higher, whereas the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, uric acid, phosphorous and iron were lower in the blood serum of birds from the E groups.",

All the new guard hairs had developed by the end of June. About 7 and 3.5 months were needed for the growth of new winter guard and underfur hairs respectively. At the end of November the winter fur was mature. The bundles with an intermediate guard hair contained more underfur hairs than the bundles with a large guard hair in the mature winter fur.

The performance of the pigs and certain chemical and physical parameters of their tibia and fibula bones were used as criteria for the effectiveness of the treatments. The variables in diet formulation were microbial phytase addition of 500 FTU kg−1 (‐/+ ) and three P levels—high (HP), medium (MP) and low (7.7, 6.1 and 4.5 g of total P kg−1 dry matter, respectively). Two additional diets were combinations of the former: MP—LP—and MP + LP —. The medium P level was sufficient for the pigs from 30 kg up to slaughter at 100 kg with the growth level of 900 g day and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 2.60, but the lowest P level led to an impaired average daily gain (ADG) and FCR. Microbial phytase improved the ADG (P < 0.05) and FCR of pigs (P < 0.05) on LP diet. No signs of leg weakness were observed in the pigs on any of the diets. The tibia densities decreased with decreasing dietary P. The ash content of fibula bones increased and their P content decreased with declining dietary P. Lowering the P content of the diet, using an appropriate phase feeding of P, and adding phytase into the diet could support the normal growth rate of the pigs and reduce the amount of P excretion in faeces.",

The heritabilities of AGE were over estimated in C-W/IN and C-OVER, and genetic, residual and phenotypic correlations became weaker. The litter variance ratio of AGE was seriously overestimated in C-W/IN and underestimated in C-OVER. A reduced model, without the litter effect included, resulted in even larger differences in parameter estimates between culling strategies.",

The trait under assortation was controlled by either 100 or 2500 loci. Twenty‐five generations of positive assortative mating in large unselected populations (effective population size equal to 1600) caused an accumulating increase in additive genetic variance (V A ) causing V A to become 440% of the base population's V A . Negative assortative mating had a small asymptotic effect in the opposite direction, causing V A to become 72% of the base population's V A . Changes in V A were due almost exclusively to gametic phase (linkage) disequilibrium. Positive and negative assortative mating were able to slightly increase or decrease the inbreeding coefficient and the degree of homozygosity. Number of loci, population size and structure had either negligible effects in combination with negative assortative mating or worked in the direction of accentuating the effects of positive assortative mating.

The concentrate was a mixture with barley, oats, wheat, soyabean and molasses as main components. In addition, the animals had ad libitum access to grass silage. As expected, the bulls fed the high concentrate diet had higher growth rate than bulls fed moderate level of concentrate. Angus 2 NRF bulls fed the high level of concentrate showed the highest growth rate of the four subgroups and were on average slaughtered at the age of 15 months. Limousin 2 NRF bulls fed the moderate level of concentrate were the subgroup with the lowest growth rate and needed 20 months to reach the target slaughter weight, which on average was 280 and 340 kg for Angus 2 NRF and Limousin 2 NRF, respectively. Although the animals at the high concentrate level had a greater intake of energy day -1 , there was no significant difference in feed conversion calculated as FUm kg -1 gain between the subgroups. The Limousin cross-breeds had significantly higher relative proportions of muscle in the carcass, but less bone and fat than the Angus cross-breeds. Consequently, the Limousin 2 NRF bulls achieved better muscularity grading in the EUROP system than the Angus 2 NRF bulls. Concentrate level yielded different fatness scores in the EUROP system, while breed did not. The correlation between carcass weight and psoas major or longissimus dorsi muscles was stronger for the former muscle. There was a tendency for Angus 2 NRF bulls fed the moderate concentrate level to have more tender longissimus muscle than the other subgroups, but this difference was not significant.",

A total of 36 yearling female mink, fitted with jugular vein catheters and raising litters of six or seven kits, was fed ad libitum lactation diets with different amounts of ME derived from protein, fat and carbohydrates (year 1:61:37:2, 46:37:17 and 31:37:32; year 2:61:38:1, 47:52:1 and 33:66:1). After 3 h fasting the dams were fed 210 kJ ME of the experimental diets. Blood samples were drawn 10 and 5 min before feeding and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min postprandially. The glucose concentration was increased 30 to 150 min postprandially in dams fed the carbohydrate-containing diets (46:37:17 and 31:37:32), whereas the glucose concentration showed no postprandial response in dams fed the carbohydrate-free diets (61:38:1, 47:52:1 and 33:66:1). Plasma insulin concentrations were increased 30 to 120 min postprandially in all dams, irrespective of dietary treatment. Plasma concentrations of glucagon were higher ( P <0.005) in dams fed the low-protein diets (31:37:32 and 33:66:1) than in dams fed the high-protein diets (61:37:2 and 61:38:1). Postprandially, the glucagon : insulin ratios decreased in dams fed the carbohydrate-containing diets, whereas the glucagon:insulin ratios tended to increase in dams fed the carbohydrate-free diets. Plasma concentrations of urea were significantly higher in dams fed the high-protein diets. Plasma concentrations of FFA, measured in the second experiment (year 2) only, showed increased concentrations postprandially, the responses being significant in dams fed the 33:66:1 and 61:38:1 diets. In conclusion, the mink is able to regulate the concentrations of blood constituents involved in maintaining glucose homoeostasis, and thereby to adapt to a wide range of dietary protein and carbohydrate supply.",

We tested these premises by assessing 2212 litters from the Yorkshire breed for litter size, while 3038 growing pigs from 550 of these litters were assessed for growth rate during the grow-out stage of production. Genetic correlations were estimated using the additive genetic (co)variances obtained from a bivariate linear animal model fitted to litter size and growth rate. The amount of additive genetic variation expressed for growth rate as a function of litter size was estimated by fitting a univariate linear animal model with random regression on litter size. Our findings did not support the first of our premises as we found that the genetic correlation between litter size and growth rate was favourable (0.28±0.27), albeit not significantly different from zero. However, we were able to support our second premise as we found that the relationship between amount of additive genetic variation for growth rate and litter size was quadratic; the amount of additive genetic variation was highest in small and large litters (h2=0.60 and 0.65), and lowest in intermediate litter sizes (h2=0.29). These findings indicate that: 1) breeding for litter size would not reduce the growth rate of growing pigs; and 2) the amount of genetic variation for growth rate changes with litter size.",

During weeks 4 through 6 of lactation, 10 cows were fed either a high protein to starch ratio (high) diet, 10 cows were fed a low protein to starch ratio (low) diet while 10 others continued on the control diet. During weeks 7 through 9 of lactation, all cows returned to the control diet. The diets were formulated to consist of 15.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% crude protein and 13.3%, 7.5% and 1.7% of starch for the low, control and high diets, respectively. Besides milk urea nitrogen, no other production or metabolic parameters were affected by treatment. In conclusion, manipulation of dietary protein to starch is not a potential strategy to combat physiological imbalance during early lactation.",

A group of approximately 80 ewes were observed for five years. The average body weight in October was 23.0 kg for lambs and 31.9 kg for ewes two years and older. The growth rate of lambs was 150–200 g/day during the first four months from birth but decreased to 51 g/day from August to October. The autumn weight increased the first five years of life. Ewes displayed weight loss and low levels of serum protein during winter, indicating moderate undernutrition. The weight loss was positively related to age and initial weight. The levels of vitamin B12 were higher than normally found in sheep on cultivated pasture. The serum levels of Ca, Mg and Cu were within the reference values, whereas the levels of inorganic P was slightly below the reference values.",

In the present study, the upstream sequence of porcine ISG58 gene was first characterized as functional promoter by luciferase reporter assay, and then two directly adjacent IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), one at −206 to −194 (ISRE-I) and a second one, directly upstream of this element at −219 to −207 bp (ISRE-II), were identified using the bioinformatics method. The subsequent site-directed deletion and transient transfection experiments showed the candidate ISREs are functional. ISRE-I works better than ISRE-II and synergistic cooperation exists between two ISREs. Additionally, the effect of porcine ISG58 on activation of NF-κB was analyzed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay.

The median-joining network diagram of MC1R haplotypes showed most Min pigs and other Asia domestic breeds own similar haplotypes to ACCGA, while the haplotypes of Europe pig breeds are similar to GTTAG. The phylogenetic analysis of the MC1R CDS further showed Min pigs are close to Laiwu pigs (Shandong, China), which indicated that the black coat color trait of Min pig might be originated and evolved from the black pig breed in Shandong Peninsula of China.",

The preheating of the samples in a water bath and prior to the analysis of SCC and composition also did not affect the levels of PAG, allowing the same sample used in the quality analysis to be used for the pregnancy test.",

The phenotypic variation in PRFC among cocks was found to be large (SD=6.19%) and the heritability of PRFC was estimated to be 0.37 ± 0.29. Factors causal to the variation in PRFC were differences in fat content, behavioural pattern and heat loss in metabolic processes. Including PRFC, recorded on cocks in one four-week period after 24 weeks of age, as a selection criterion in an index may be suggested to improve the efficiency of food utilization in layers.",

Correlated results in the residual period were generally in good agreement with expectations. Crosses of the two specialised lines were compared with index/egg mass line, and it was concluded that there is an optimum value for the number of generations that the process of crossing the specialised lines is worthwhile, i.e. generation six in our experiment.

The genetic origin of the RFLP is an insertion (I)/deletion(D) in the 3′-region of the growth hormone gene. The calves were tested at 3–4 months of age and again at 9–10 months of age for plasma GH concentration before and following three GH release tests: fasting-refeeding (n = 57), arginine injection (n = 28) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (n = 24). The RFLP typing showed 36, 19 and 2 calves of the genotypes II, ID and DD at the I/D site, respectively. The frequency of the D-allele was higher in the high than in the low selection line (0.29 vs. 0.05, P <0.01). At 9–10 months of age the GH release following TRH injection was larger in calves with genotype II (35.9 ± 4.5 ng/ml) compared with calves with genotype ID (23.6 ± 3.8 ng/ml) (P <0.05), and the calves from the high line had a higher GH release after TRH injection (42.9 ± 5.5 ng/ml) compared to low-line calves (19.7 ± 3.4 ng/ml) (P <0.001). These results may indicate that the I/D site may affect or be a genetic marker for TRH-induced GH release in dairy calves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To determine the influence of lamb presence on the dairy ewes circadian system we monitored simultaneously 16 different parameters (insulin, glucose, total protein, urea, cholesterol, triglycerides, total bilirubine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, rectal temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate). Sixteen clinically healthy Sarda breed dairy ewes, divided into two groups, group A with their lambs and group B without their lambs, were used. Data collection was done at 3 hourly intervals over a 24-h period. Our results indicate that lamb presence influences ewes metabolism, inducing modifications of the acrophase and robustness of the rhythm of some physiological variables. Most variables lost the rhythmicity that they show in not pregnant and not lactating ewes. Lamb presence also influenced urea circadian rhythm: the time of urea peak was shifted from 16:00 to 12:24±00:35 when ewes were housed with lambs, and on triglycerides circadian rhythm.

    "abstract": "Abstract The manager of a dairy herd and the affiliated consultants constantly need to judge whether financial performance of the production system is satisfactory and whether financial performance relates to real (systematic) effects of changes in management. This is no easy task because the dairy herd is a very complex system. Thus, it is difficult to obtain empirical data that allows a valid estimation of the random (within-herd) variation in financial performance corrected for management changes. Thus, simulation seems to be the only option. This study suggests that much caution must be recommended when claming effect of changes in herd management because the link between management changes (cause) and effect (measured as improvement of gross margin per cow year) is extensively blurred by a large within-herd variation in available real life accounting data and differences between herds in time to steady state following management changes.",

Serum cholesterol and triglyceride decreased, but HDL content increased parallel to the Salomega level in the diet (P < 0.05). The MDA level in the yolk of bird eggs of the 3 or 4% Salomega treatment was higher than the MDA level of the control group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the enrichment of laying hens' diet with 3 and 4% salomega can enhance egg production, elevate the levels of Omega-3 fatty acids, and decrease the oxidative stability of yolk lipids.",

In order to be useful for 25 generations a control population should satisfy the following requirements: (i) phenotypic correlation of mates, r P, close to zero; (ii) negligible amount of random drift; and (iii) large number of loci controlling the trait under consideration. It was concluded that under the assumptions of the design used in the present study the number of animals to produce a negligible amount of random drift (200 mating pairs) is much smaller than the number of animals necessary for r p to be sufficiently close to zero to exclude unconscious assortative mating (400 mating pairs). The minimum number of loci required allowing the trait to show a sufficiently large amount of genetic variation even in long‐term selection studies depends, among other things, on the selection intensity and the number of generations involved. In more intensely selected populations more loci are required. In long‐term selection experiments with 25 generations and 25% selected, the number of loci required, each with a very small equal effect, was 2500. An unselected control population fulfilling these requirements behaves similarly to the predictions of both the Hardy‐Weinberg model and the infinitesimal model.",

Ultrasonic scanning measurements of a cross‐sectional area of m. longissimus dorsi were recorded for 137 Swedish Red and White (SRB) and 246 Swedish Friesian (SLB) performance‐tested bulls. Estimated heritabilities were 0.49 for SRB and 0.36 for SLB. Body measures and muscularity scores were recorded for 638 performance‐tested SLB bulls that were divided into two age groups. Estimated heritabilities for most of the body measures and muscularity scores were between 0.2 and 0.7. Heritabilities were larger for traits expressing height than width or length of the body and larger also for older bulls. The predictive value of body measures and muscularity scores on carcass traits was investigated. Carcass and muscle weight were determined principally by live weight or age at slaughter. The coefficients of determination decreased by 5 to 12% for carcass conformation and 15% for dressing percentage when breed origin, muscularity scores and/or body measures were excluded from the model.

Some early methods for converting proofs from one population to another are based on simple linear regression. An alternative robust regression method based on the t-distribution is presented, and maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques for analysis are described, including the situation in which some proofs are missing. Procedures were used to investigate the relationship between Holstein sire proofs obtained by two Uruguayan genetic evaluation programs. The results suggest that conversion equations developed from data including only sires having proofs in both populations can lead to distorted results, relative to estimates obtained using techniques for incomplete data. There was evidence of non-normality of regression residuals, which constitutes an additional source of bias. A robust estimator may not solve all problems, but can provide simple conversion equations that are less sensitive to outlying proofs and to departures from assumptions.",

The cows were divided into two groups: zero-grazing with tiestalls, or grazing during summer. Effects were studied by mixed-model analysis. The results indicated that grazing (rather than zero-grazing) can reduce the milk yield in the following lactation in SLB cows, whereas it had little effect on the production of SRB cows. Grazing SJB cows produced more milk, but with a significantly lower fat content. Grazing before or during the postpartum period stimulated reproductive performance, indicating a higher conception rate in all breeds and a 13-27-day shorter interval from calving to conception in the SRB and SLB cows, whereas in the limited number of SJB cows, the trend was the converse.",

However, significantly more rearing pigs were affected by parameters linked to gut health (P = 0.05) and rhinitis (P = 0.02). Pathological deviations in tails of wild boars were linked to external parasites. Wild boars are not healthier than rearing pigs (or vice versa). However, causes for diseases differ. The gut seems to be challenged in the rearing pigs. This may be explained by a nutritional challenge due to early weaning and might be linked to the development of tail biting.

This study investigated time consumption and feasibility of using handheld skin temperature sensors in a dairy farm and the correlation of the recordings with indoor and rectal temperature. Skin temperatures in 21 dairy cows of two breeds were recorded monthly during one year at the neck, hip and vulva, using two techniques (infrared radiation (IR) and conduction). Rectal and indoor ambient temperature were recorded on the same occasion. Time spent recording temperature was ∼2 s/cow with IR and >1 min/cow with conduction technique. Skin temperatures did not correlate well with rectal temperature but correlated strongly with indoor temperature. Neck temperature recorded by IR best reflected indoor temperature, with no difference between breeds, and could be a tool for quick monitoring of ambient conditions in individual cows.",

The present study was undertaken to evaluate 17 linear-type traits, behavioural and functional traits for estimating the genetic parameters and to find their association with production performance in KF cattle using a multi-trait Bayesian animal model. Among linear-type traits, stature, chest girth, body length and body depth had a high positive genetic and phenotypic correlation (ranging from 0.30 ± 0.01 to 0.74 ± 0.03) with production traits (total milk yield and 305 days milk yield). The majority of the linear-type traits, milking temperament and milking speed were moderately heritable (ranging from 0.25 ± 0.04 to 0.40 ± 0.03), while days open had low heritability (0.20 ± 0.25). This study showed the importance of reliable assessment of genetic parameters and incorporation of a few linear-type traits having high heritability and genetic correlation with production traits, can be utilized for future selection and breeding programmes in KF cattle.",

A joint evaluation of bulls progeny-tested in these three Nordic countries was feasible in the presence of data from the four exporting countries. National proofs of more than 35 000 bulls from these countries were then analyzed with a linear model to rank bulls across country for milk, fat and protein yields. Results from the international evaluation were consistent with results from individual national evaluations. National proofs of bulls whose semen had been imported into the Nordic countries were found biased upwards by an average 4–5%, resulting in a substantial over-estimation of the international proofs of foreign bulls. Excluding these records from the analysis did not affect the data connectedness. Joint Nordic evaluations should be calculated using data only from the country where bulls receive their first official proof.",

The experimental chicks were from a two-directional selection experiment, in which a duplicate hatch to the second generation was performed. Two of the lines in the selection experiment were developed for low PRFC and one line for high PRFC. Mean PRFC in the chick experiment were in close accordance with the mean PRFC of the corresponding lines in the selection experiment. There was significantly higher food consumption in the first 5 weeks of age in the high PRFC line compared to one of the low PRFC lines. Moderate phenotypic correlations were found between early food consumption and PRFC as adults, which theoretically permit the possibility of using food consumption in very young chicks as a selection criterion when preselecting for PRFC.",

The adequacy of the adjustment factors was also tested within the breeds Swedish Finewool (Lf), Swedish Rya (Lr) and Crossbred group having crossbred parents (X*X). Analyses (1981–83) were based on 140681 Pelt lambs, 16785 lambs from the L-group, 25092 lambs from the X-group and 6321 lambs from the K-group. Data from 1986–88 comprised in total 11% fewer lambs. The adjusted weights for lambs after 1- and 2-year old ewes were underestimated by previous adjustment factors in all breed groups except Peltsheep. The adjusted weights were too high for single born and single reared lambs after yearlings in Peltsheep. The previous adjustment factors for litter size generally gave adjusted weights which were too high for single lambs and too low for triplets. The earlier adjustment factors gave adjusted weights for ram lambs that were too high in comparison with ewe lambs. Finally the adjustment factors for age of lamb underestimated adjusted weights by 10% in Peltsheep and the L-group, while in the X- and K-group weights were overestimated to the same degree. A new set of adjustment factors is suggested.",

A pulsatile GH secretory pattern was still present for all the 8-week-old chickens examined. Overall mean GH levels, and to a lesser extent GH baseline and GH amplitude values, were higher for FCR chickens compared with GL chickens. Mean GH concentrations, baseline and amplitudes were slightly, but not significantly, superior in males. Length and frequency of pulses were not influenced by line or sex. In view of the current knowledge on age- and sex-related changes in pulsatile GH secretion, it is argued that the line and sex differences would have been more pronounced in younger chickens. Based on this, the hypothesis that the amplitude of the pulsatile GH release is related to protein conversion efficiency and protein deposition rather than to average body weight gain is corroborated.",

An interaction of sex with population and environment was considered and found significant for traits with a large sex dimorphism.

The treatments were the percentage of probiotic supplementation on basal diet: PP0 (control/basal diet with no probiotic supplementation); PP025 (basal diet with 0.25% probiotic); PP050 (basal diet with 0.50% probiotic); PP075 (basal diet with 0.75% probiotic). The calculated amount of probiotic is then mixed to the basal diet prior to supplying to the animals. Rams fed diet with 0.50% and 0.75% probiotic supplementation had higher ADF, NDF, and cellulose digestibility compared with other treatments. In conclusion, the supplementation 0.50% probiotic in the diet is beneficial to enhance forage fibre digestibility in rams without giving any negative effect on performance.",

Costs and income were discounted and summarized to a DCLP at time of birth, converted to profit as a monthly annuity equivalent value, MEQ. MEQ was regressed on the 53 original variables (Lasso) or on factor scores (EFA) derived from the original variables. Both EFA and Lasso regressions were used to deal with co-linearity problems.

A1A1 milk products had higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and lower levels of saturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were mainly found in A2A2 milk products and were lowest in A1A2 products.

Semen from these five lines was used in a balanced scheme in four production herds with Landrace × Large White sows. About 100 litters from each line were produced, and from each litter one gilt and one castrate were selected at weaning and shipped to an early weaning unit, then to test stations, and tested from 30 kg to 115 kg live weight. Pair‐wise comparisons of lines were made, and P‐values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Daily gain (g day−1), feed conversion (kg feed/kg gain) and lean percentage of offspring from HD, DD, YD, KRUSTA, and PIC 416 adjusted for halothane genotypes were (933, 952, 942, 944, and 924), (2.84, 2.80, 2.84, 2.99, and 2.92), (58.6, 58.3, 58.5, 57.4, and 58.5). The differences in daily gain were not significant. KRUSTA had significantly lower lean content than all the other lines. KRUSTA and PIC 416 had significantly poorer feed conversion than HD, DD and YD. Sires from PIC 416 were all carriers of the halothane gene, genotype Nn, whereas all other sires except three were of genotype NN. Large differences between Nn and NN were found in this study: daily gain 24.90 g day‐1 (SE 11.5), feed conversion ‐0.168 kg kg‐1 (SE 0.031), lean percentage 2.47 (SE 0.37). In the above mentioned comparisons of the lines PIC 416 benefits from half of the Nn‐NN difference. This is a relevant comparison in the future scenario where all production sows will be of genotype NN. Key words: economic valuehalothane genemultiple comparisons",

Half of the cows were fed restrictedly according to Swedish standards (R) and half were fed ad libitum (AL). In the previous lactation three cows from each treatment had a high milk fat content (HF) and three had a low fat content (LF). Blood and rumen samples were taken in lactation weeks (lw) 8 and 21. In lw 21, the AL cows had a lower proportion of acetate in the rumen VFA, a higher plasma level of gastrin and a different diurnal pattern of insulin compared with the R cows. The LF cows had a higher plasma level of insulin after feeding than the HF cows in lw 21. Correlation analysis showed that the plasma level of somatostatin was positively related to milk fat content both in lw 8 and in lw 21. In addition, the milk trans‐C18:1 fatty acids were inversely related to milk fat content in lw 8, whereas the proportion of butyrate in rumen VFA was positively related and the proportion of propionate was inversely related to milk fat content in lw 21. A route by which somatostatin could regulate milk fat synthesis is discussed. Key words: acetatebutyratediurnal variationfeedinggastrininsulinoxytocinpropionatesomatostatin",

    "abstract": "A study of ewe performance was undertaken in 795 sheep flocks based on data from the Norwegian Sheep Recording System. Herd level data included in the annual report for 1998 were used as the basis for the study. Average flock size was 75.3 ewes. The material was considered as representative of the better and more motivated sheep farmers in the mountain valley regions in south-eastern Norway. The average number of lambs born per ewe, inclusive (and exclusive) of barren ewes, was 1.89 (2.02), and of autumn lambs (those surviving from birth in the spring to autumn) 1.60 (1.66). The average autumn weight of the lambs corrected to 145 days of age was 42.4 kg, giving an overall performance of 67.9 kg lambs live weight per ewe. When including artificially reared lambs, overall performance was 70.4 kg per ewe. Artificial rearing of lambs, mostly triplets which had been removed from the ewe, was practised on 395 of the farms. In the 74 flocks with a rate of artificial rearing of more than 10% of all lambs, overall performance per ewe was 13.3 kg higher than in flocks with no artificial rearing. Total lamb mortality from birth to autumn recording, including stillborn lambs, was 12.44%. Mortality had a skewed distribution, some flocks having very high mortality figures. The arithmetic means (and medians) for mortality were as follows: 2.75 (2.29)% stillbirths, 2.93 (2.30)% died during the indoor feeding period, 0.88 (0.00)% at spring pasture, and 6.16 (4.40)% at summer pasture. In regression models using Proc Genmod in SAS®, it was found that average number of autumn lambs per ewe was negatively associated with the rate of barren ewes, late lambing date (flock average day in year when lambing took place), and total lamb mortality. The corrected autumn weight of the lambs was positively associated with the average number of lambs born per ewe and non-fertility rate, and negatively associated with flock size and total lamb mortality. The Dala breed had a positive effect on number of autumn lambs per ewe, and Spæl breed a negative effect on corrected autumn live weight of the lambs.",

The females and kits were weighed at parturition and 2, 3, 4, and 7 weeks after parturition. Blood samples were collected from females in the second, fourth, and sixth week of the lactation period. Carbohydrate-free diets fed to lactating mink can in principle support normal performance, health of the females, and growth performance of the kits. However, mink need a sufficient supply of available gluconeogenic precursors in the form of amino acids. In the present experiment, the diet with 33% of ME from protein contained insufficient amounts of gluconeogenic precursors for lactating mink, and three weeks post partum this group was excluded from the experiment. The differences in dietary protein level (61% and 47% of ME) and fat level (38% and 52% of ME) influenced the plasma concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA) and urea, but had minimal influence on plasma concentrations of other nutrients, metabolites, and hormones.",

The calves (mean liveweight±SD, 124±24 kg and 133±24 kg on Farm I and II respectively) were supplemented daily with 3 kg energy and protein-rich commercial concentrates (group EP), 3 kg barley (group E) or kg barley (group Eres) for 8 weeks following turn-out on pasture. Daily weight gains in the 8 weeks were for Farm I: 1216 and 1042 g/day for group EP and E (P<0.01) and for Farm II: 1071, 671 and 770 g/day for group EP, E and Eres respectively (P<0.001). However, liveweights were similar between groups at housing, although group EP had significantly higher liveweight at housing on Farm I (P<0.01). Initial liveweight had effects on daily gain in the grazing season, but supplementation with energy and protein reduced this effect on Farm I. No clinical signs of coccidiosis were observed, but markedly higher levels of oocysts per gram faeces (opg) were observed on Farm II, using pastures previously grazed by cattle compared to Farm I. Calves having a maximum oocyst count above 5 000 opg were subclinically affected by coccidiosis, as indicated by low faecal dry matter and reduction in daily gain of 222 g/day (P<0.05). It is concluded that liveweight can be increased when supplementing calves with organic concentrates rich in energy and protein in the period following turn-out compared to supplementation with barley alone. However the overall gain at the end of the grazing season is limited due to compensatory growth in the grazing period following supplementation.",

We established that the later a birth occurred, the lower the number of kits in the litter. We observed that as temperature was increased and relative humidity was decreased, the percentage of dead kits in a litter became lower.

    "abstract": "The objective was to investigate the effects of the β-adrenergic agonist cimaterol (CIM) on growth and carcass quality of Friesian young bulls at different developmental stages. The study comprised three liveweight groups (WG) each of four pairs of monozygotic twins. The average initial liveweight (LW) of the animals in WG 1, 2, and 3 was 162, 299 and 407 kg, respectively. One animal of each pair was fed 0.056 mg CIM per kg LW for 90 days, while the other served as a control (C). The animals were fed concentrate and barley straw according to LW and restricted to 80-90% of the ad libitum level of intake. The animals were slaughtered on day 90 of the treatment period. Without affecting feed intake, CIM treatment increased average daily gain (ADG) by 19% (P<0.001) and thus improved feed efficiency (P<0.001). Dressing percentage, carcass gain, EUROP conformation and longissimus dorsi area were all increased (P<0.001) after CIM treatment. Carcass length (P<0.01), backfat thickness (P<0.05), and internal fat (P<0.001) were reduced after CIM treatment, whereas organ weights were only marginally reduced. Weights of all of 14 different commercial cuts were increased (P<0.002), the increase was largest in cuts from the hind region of the carcass. The percentage of carcass saleable meat increased (P<0.001) in CIM-treated animals. The effects of cimaterol were evident in all three WG. The results show that cimaterol is effective in stimulating overall growth performance and improving carcass leanness of young bulls at different developmental stages, and concomitantly reducing fat deposition in general.",

Deviations from expectations of DYD minus the pedigree index and the regression of DYD on the EBV for each of the parents were estimated. The EBV of each bull dam was calculated in several ways using different combinations of pedigree information and their own records. In all, 1693 bulls (880 Black and White (BW), 418 Red Danish (RD) and 395 Danish Jersey (DJ)) with Direct Updating indices for milk and fat yield were included in the investigation. Mean discrepancies between estimated and observed genetic merit for kg of milk yield were −348 for BW, −213 for RD and −228 for DJ, when all of the bull dams' individual records were utilized in breeding value estimation. The corresponding mean discrepancies for kg of fat yield were −14.7, −11.5 and −11.9, respectively. The discrepancies were positively correlated with the number of lactation records included in the dams' EBVs. Regression coefficients of bull DYDs on bull dam breeding values were significantly lower than expected for RD and BW regardless of the number of individual lactation records included in the dams' indexes for milk and fat yield. For all three breeds, the regression coefficients were lowest for fat yield. The most probable cause of overestimation in bull dam EBVs is preferential treatment, particularly in second and later lactations. To avoid this bias, estimation of a bull dam's breeding value should be based on pedigree information and on records from only her first lactation. Key Words: biasbull damefficiencyselection",

The treatments had a significant effect on changes in the live weight of ewes during late pregnancy and early lactation, with ewes on higher feeding levels losing less weight during pregnancy and gaining less weight on pasture. Over the whole production year, the changes during different production periods levelled out the total effect. Late pregnancy feeding also had a significant effect on lamb growth, with lambs from ewes fed on the highest feeding level growing significantly better. Lambs from ewes fed on a gradually rising feeding pattern showed significantly better growth in Expt. 1 but not in Expt. 2.",

The various collagen species were characterized using capillary zone electrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein blotting followed by antibody analysis for type I collagen. The data showed that the amount of soluble collagen declines with age. Using capillary electrophoresis it was also found that the distribution of soluble collagen differs in very young kits' skin compared with older animals' skin, whereas the skin from animals more than 2 weeks old was found to contain the same proportions of various collagen species. Antibody analysis of type I collagen found no difference in the relative amount between different age groups, and only the acetic acid-containing buffer extracted type I collagen from the mink skin.",

Pertaining to the study, data were collected from 300 market functionaries selected through multi-stage random sampling from 30 live animal markets in South India. Suitable statistical analyses were applied to achieve the objectives of the study. The market structure of small ruminants was observed to be 'Atomistically competitive'. The volume of business/number of animals transacted was found to be more or less equal among the market functionaries. The variables, such as age, sex, utility of animal and festival season, were the significant variables in the price determination of small ruminants during their sale in live animal markets. The infrastructure facilities available in selected shandies were inadequate. Necessary recommendations were made to improve the efficiency of marketing of small ruminants.KEYWORDS: Markets (shandies)structureefficiencyprice determinantsinfrastructure AcknowledgementsThe present study is the M.V.Sc., thesis of the first author submitted to the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chennai.

During concentrate consumption, feeding, drinking and displacement at the trough (when a pig changed a feeding place) were directly recorded. During hay consumption, hay chewing, resting, exploring, playing and synchronisation while hay chewing were scored. MH ate faster and drank less than KP; however, they changed their feeding places more often and showed a higher probability to chew hay (overall P<0.01). MH pigs tended to chew hay more synchronously than KP (P<0.10). The results show that concentrate and hay consumption habits vary between the Slovene KP and the MH pig.",

Blood serum concentrations of g -carotene, retinol, f -tocopherol, triacylglycerides and cholesterol, as well as liver concentrations of g -carotene, retinol, triacylglycerides and cholesterol, were included as response factors. g Carotene was not detectable in serum and liver. Serum and liver retinol concentrations were positively correlated with dietary concentrations of g -carotene and retinol acetate ( R 2 = 0.84 and 0.95, respectively).

Estimation of genetic correlations and inbreeding depression was performed on 2644 first-lactation cows and 4914 multiple-lactation cows, respectively. We found no significant genetic correlation between the loser cow score and the inbreeding level or between the loser cow score and protein yield. However, the loser cow score was favorably correlated with RPL (−0.53). This implies that the prevalence of loser cows is neither a result of inbreeding depression nor an undesirable side effect of selecting for increased production.",

Experimental treatments were two light programmes of light:dark hours in trials 1 (24:0 and 16:8) and 2 (21:3 and 16:8), and two dietary fat sources of animal fat (AF) and soy bean oil (SBO) in trial 3. Within each trial the broilers were reared in separate pens of each replicate (n = 4) in two similar houses. The total frequency of skin tears and downgraded skin tears caused by the plucking process were registered by visual examination of 325 broilers from each replicate after plucking, and all carcasses were weighed individually. Broilers with intact skin and with skin tears were removed from the slaughter line and after air chilling, breast skin samples with dermis and hypodermis were cut and used for skin tensile strength and elasticity measurement. Light programmes with long dark periods during raising of broilers reduced skin tearing at the processing plant. The use of soy bean oil as dietary fat source in comparison with animal fat increased the skin tearing frequency (P = 0.066) and showed slightly reduced skin elasticity. Skin tears were more frequent among female broilers, and they had a lower skin tensile strength (P < 0.001) and elasticity (P < 0.01). An overall positive correlation between broiler weight and skin tears was found and a negative correlation between frequency of skin tears and breast skin elasticity was found for female broilers, whereas skin strength showed less connection to skin tear occurrence.

The swine ARL3 gene was weakly expressed in lung, spleen, and kidney, hardly expressed in small intestine, large intestine, liver, muscle and fat. The swine ARL4A gene was moderately expressed in fat and lung, weakly in large intestine, liver, and spleen, and not expressed in small intestine, muscle, and kidney.

Subsequently, nine promoter segments with different base pair sizes were obtained and ligated into PGL3-Basic vectors, respectively. Lastly, the functional activity of each of the aforementioned promoters was tested separately in transiently transfected C2C12 cells via a dual-luciferase assay system. The results indicated that the sequence −199 bp to −31 bp may have the basic activity of the promoter. Further analysis demonstrated that the sequence −137 bp to −101 bp was important for the basic transcriptional activity.

The objective of this short paper is to propose some ideas on the future needs and developments in statistics and quantitative genetics in animal genetics. Several scenarios are proposed. One is more developed and assumes that genotypes will be entirely known. This would have some consequences on statistical models in animal genetics. More effort would be put on measuring the environment. Large dimensional spaces must be considered in statistical modelling, and this is a particularly challenging perspective. Modelling G×E (gene–environment) interactions in this context, epigenetics phenomena, etc. would be of prime interest.

The genetic parameters of the elk hunting traits were estimated using a repeatability animal model. Season, place, and type of the trial, weather during the trial, and dog sex and age were considered fixed effects in the models, and trial judge and dog litter were treated as random effects. Variance components were estimated with the AI-REML method using the DMU-software. Heritability estimates were generally low (0.01–0.04). The highest estimated heritability was 0.04 for searching. Repeatability estimates for elk hunting traits varied between 0.04 and 0.14. Genetic correlations varied from very weak to very strong (−0.21–1.00) and were particularly strong between the barking traits.",

The study found that duration of crops other than fodder crops and land size increases the chances to adopt, while the area under sorghum and farmers being women decrease the chances to adopt Hybrid Napier. The propensity-score matching revealed that farmers adopting Hybrid Napier had significant higher milk production than non-adopters. But at the same time the expenditure on feed(s) and cost of milk production per unit of milk for adopters were significantly higher than non-adopters. Thus farming situation(s) and gender were the major drivers for the adoption of Hybrid Napier rather than as a strategy to reduce cost of milk production.",

The average daily gain (ADG) of the 3–6 months, fattening period(12-30 months of age) and experimental period (birth-30 months of age) tended to be higher for spring-born calves than for autumn-born calves(p < 0.01). The body conformation traits almost part was higher spring-born calves than autumn-born calves(p < 0.05). Spring-born calves also had higher carcass weight and back fat thickness than autumn-born calves (p < 0.05) and net income.

DY piglets in the AP treatment spent more time in the neighbouring pen than SY (24.0% vs 19.0%), while AP piglets of both genetic lines spent less time lying down before weaning than CP. At weaning, CP piglets increased their time in the piglet corner and spent less time lying. SY piglets were less responsive to social interactions.

The data collection was done by the personal interview method with pretested schedule in two divisions of north Karnataka with 160 respondents each making a total of 320 respondents. The majority of the farmers did not build any new animal houses or flood water as the source of drinking water. The majority of livestock farmers expressed favourable opinions regarding the flood warning system. The first and foremost challenge faced by livestock farmers was fodder storage and shortage.

For adult ewes, rumen weight corrected for carcass weight, was lower (P < 0.05) for ONS compared to NWS (LSMEANS 1371 vs. 1665 g). Our results suggest that previously observed breed differences between ONS and NWS in feed intake and enteric CH4 emissions (lower feed intake and enteric CH4 emissions per kg body weight, for ONS) may be linked to differentiation in rumen size. This should however be investigated further, by measuring feed intake, enteric CH4 emissions and rumen size on the same individuals. Understanding breed-specific factors associated with enteric CH4 emissions is relevant for selection practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.",

The activity was studied using four different enzyme substrates at physiological pH levels actual in the duodenum-jejunum part of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. 5.0, 5.8, 6.6 and 7.4. The enzymatic action was tested towards four inhibitors, known to be suppressive to specific phosphatases located in other regions of the organism, in order to compare the kinetics of intestinal phosphatases versus other phosphatases. Phosphohydrolase activity in the mucosa was evident at the physiological pH levels. The scale of activity was highly dependent upon pH and enzyme substrate used. L(+)tartrate appeared to be a potent inhibitor in concentrations between 10 and 80 mmol 1−1 although the response was not consistently dose dependent. Sodium fluoride, in a 50 mmol 1−1 concentration, on average depressed phosphatase activity by 40%, while molybdate in concentrations up to 100 μmol 1−1 had only a marginal effect on the activity (mean inhibition 13%)—strictly in contrast to acidic phosphatases of bone osteoclasts. Copper ions exerted a significant depression on phosphatase activity towards three out of four substrates, even at concentrations of 2–20 μmol 1−1. This effect may be of nutritional importance, because young pigs are traditionally fed high levels of copper sulphate to stimulate growth. The consequences of this feeding practice on the phosphatases in the mucosa and the nutrient absorption are not known, and the effect upon other intestinal enzymes also remains unknown.

Storage duration for the dried raw skins was approximately one year, during which the changes in their fatty acid compositions were analysed. After the storage period the skins were dressed and the physical characteristics of the leathers were determined. The dietary background of the animals had a significant influence on the fatty acid profiles of the dried raw skins, but it did not affect their fat peroxidation during storage. Moreover, freezing at a temperature of -20 [ddot]C or the antioxidant treatments employed did not prevent lipid peroxidation in the skins. In the pickle-treated skins the changes in the fatty acid profiles were even more pronounced than in the other groups. The only skins in which the fatty acid composition stayed constant were those stored in nitrogen gas. The dietary background affected the breaking load and the elongation at break of the leather. Based on the measured physical characteristic of elongation at break, the quality of the leather decreased when the skins were stored in circumstances involving oxygen. The storage period is recommended to be kept to a minimum time, and storage temperatures above ±0 [ddot]C should be avoided, because of water condensation. The results also emphasize the importance of careful conservation and proper handling of the dried raw skins. Key Words: antioxidantfatleatherlipidperoxidation",

    "abstract": "Abstract An objective system for beef carcass classification (BCC) will be available shortly. Thus, payment based on objective parameters becomes possible. Alternative pricing systems were tested on the basis of carcass composition data and visual gradings from 403 bulls. Carcass dissection data were converted into a Danish commercial cutting standard to simulate results from an objective beef classification centre. Data represented progeny of Red Danish and Danish Friesian cows sired randomly with one of the following breeds: Angus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Piemontese, South Devon, Brown Swiss, Red Belgian, Blue Belgian, Red Danish or Danish Friesian. Bull calves were allotted at 70 d of age to three target slaughter weights (320, 440 and 560 kg) and three feeding levels (ad lib., 85 and 70% on an energy basis). The present Danish pricing system, based on EUROP grading, was compared to an alternative pricing system based on yield of saleable meat, a muscularity index, fat trim and fat/lean colour. Compared with the conventional pricing system, the most marked difference of the alternative system was that carcasses with a high percentage of saleable meat and a high muscularity index receive price additions whereas carcasses with surplus fat receive price reductions. Early matured crossbreds with high fat deposition were downgraded, whereas muscular crossbreds were upgraded. The gross margin per day was subsequently strongly dependent on the pricing model, thereby changing the optimal production strategy.",

Frequent in situ measurements of caecal pH have been used to measure short-term changes in pH. However, this method also results in a large and complex data set. Transient random influxes of alkaline content from the small intestine might result in short-time elevations in caecal pH that complicates data processing. We used two caecal-cannulated horses fed two different rations in a cross-over design experiment. We compared frequent in situ measurements of caecal pH measured with an unweighted and a weighted pH electrode. Based on our results, we recommend to use a weighted pH electrode situated in the deeper layers of the caecum compared to an unweighted. If an unweighted electrode is used, we present a peak-detecting algorithm to eliminate short-time elevation peaks caused by the ileal influx.",

Analyses including all raced horses born between 2000 and 2009 (n = 9350) showed a relationship between premie race participation with reduced career longevity and prize money earnings. However, when analyses only included horses that raced competitively (n = 7497; i.e. horses with participation in only premie or qualification races were excluded), premie race participation was associated with increased racing success. These findings indicate that premie race fields consist of both horses with good racing ability as well as horses with limited talent.

Data on harvesting practices, CO2 emission and forage costs were collected through farm visits on 184 dairy farms in all regions of Norway in 2017 and 2018. To analyze data, machine learning methods were used.The findings show that forage harvesting capacity and forage yield are associated with CO2 emissions from on-farm use of diesel fuel and harvesting costs. Factors that mitigate CO2 emissions from harvesting coincide with factors that contribute to reduced harvesting costs. Thus the findings suggest a ‘win-to-win’ relationship between the interests of the farming business and environmental sustainability. The findings have implications for dairy farmers and policy makers.",

The study included 21 scanbrown mink pelts (winter coat), representing a larger group of 87 mink pelts coming from a feeding trial with experimental and control animals. The pelts were visually graded from 1 (blue-greyish) to 5 (reddish), primarily in respect of the CS (in auction classification=clarity of colour) of the underfur seen on the edge of the pelt. Prepared samples of underfur fibres showed in visual inspection a gliding change of colour from paler to darker in a proximal-distal direction and were consequently examined at three levels above the skin surface. The means of the dominant wavelengths (hues) were 589.40, 588.00 and 586.70 nm, respectively, indicating that the variation between levels was small. Investigation of the small pelt material concerned showed that CS was significantly correlated with the measured lightness (L*) and with the yellow chromaticity coordinate (b*) of the underfur samples. In this investigation it was also shown that the underfur fibres with a visually blue-greyish colour shade were relatively dark and less yellow compared with underfur fibres with a reddish colour shade. However, data and the model estimating the colour shade demonstrated that, for the material concerned, visually very reddish underfur colour shades were not found in the lightest coloured pelts.",

Twenty pigs were fed complete feed mixtures (groups A and B) of which 10 received proportions of AL (up to 20%) (group B). Another 20 pigs received AS (up to 30%) (groups C and D) of which 10 received proportions of AL (up to 15% of the ration) (group D). Groups A and B achieved the same growth performance and carcass traits. The use of 20% AL in the complete feed seemed to be feasible. Group D showed partially significantly lower growth and carcass performances than groups A and B. The use of AL saved 27 kg of protein feed per pig in group B compared to group A.",

The first factor was two levels of energy (medium = 2900 and high = 3000 kcal/kg) and the second factor was the use of three lipoprotein supplements (L-carnitine 100 mg/kg, choline chloride 1000 mg/kg, and 2% alternative lecithin dietary fat). Results showed that experimental diets led to significant differences (P < 0.05) in production, concentrated white height, yolk height, yolk diameter, yolk index, yolk content, and weight index to the shell. The results also showed that the use of high energy levels vs medium energy levels improved the egg quality as well as other aforementioned factors. In conclusion, the use of high energy levels (3000kcal/kg) as well as L-carnitine (100mg/kg) as a dietary supplement had the greatest effects on the studied factors.",

There is an increasing interest in extending castration age to enhance the yield of desirable traits in beef, e.g. carcass weight and longissimus muscle area. The calves were divided into four groups based on their age at castration. Body length at 12 months increased with increasing castration age (p < 0.05). Average daily gain and cold carcass weight were higher in the group castrated at 11–12 months than in the group castrated at <10 months (p < 0.05). Marbling scores were higher in the groups castrated at <10 months of age than in the groups castrated at >11 months (p < 0.05).

The simulated population consisted of six herds of 100 sows each. Daily gain at test station, lean meat % at test station, osteochondrosis at test station, feed conversion at test station, daily gain in field test and backfat thickness in field test were included in the multi-trait animal model breeding values. The average genetic gain from years 0-10 was 203, 171, 130 and 194 SEK for the alternatives CTS, NOCTS, CTSO and CTS5, respectively.

Subsequent boosters in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were made on days 14, 28, 56 and 73 of the experimental period. On day 79, half of the animals within each immunization treatment were infused continuously with human GRF(1-29)NH2 (3.33 ng min-1 kg-1 BW) and the other half with saline over a 32-day period. GRF increased (P=0.01) body weight gain by 12%, whereas SRIF immunization decreased (P=0.01) weight gain by 7.5% during the infusion period (days 79-111). However, the effect of SRIF immunization on growth rate was not significant (P>0.10) when considered over the entire duration of the experiment (days 0-111). Feed intake, feed efficiency, carcass characteristics, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention and metabolizability of energy were not affected (P>0.10) by SRIF immunization or GRF infusion. However, GRF infusion increased pancreatic activity of amylase (P<0.05).

The study's objective was to examine the effect of alternative strategies under the assumption of particular biases. Bias in the evaluation of bull dam estimated breeding values (EBVs) causes an estimated reduction of 32% in their genetic superiority, compared with the theoretical potential. Biased evaluations caused selection of too many bull dams from later lactations. Two alternative strategies were developed to account for existing bias. Results suggested that the influence of bias could be reduced. The estimated improvement in selection response was 11–13% higher than current practice. Problems with biased EBVs in conventional breeding schemes are discussed and a method to counteract bias from future breeding schemes is presented.

The material consisted of 1447 young bulls with non-return rates based on at least 500 inseminations each. A reduced animal model including a full additive relationship matrix was used. Multiple regressions were fitted for the estimation of the average gene substitution effects as well as the gene-frequency-independent effects of additive gene action and dominance. To evaluate the results a multivariate analysis of variance, classical segregation analyses and marker frequency studies were performed. Significant associations were found between the F, B, Tf, S and C systems, and nonreturn rates, but the contribution of the markers to the total variation of non-return rates was small.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to determine whether adjustment factors for lamb weight (covering ewe age, litter size, sex and lamb age) should be different for different types of flocks. The appropriateness of using common adjustment factors for all flocks was studied with respect to interaction between the adjusted effects and with region, flock size and production level. The survey was based on data from the Swedish Sheep Recording Scheme from the years 1981–83, comprising the main breed groups Swedish Peltsheep (P), Swedish Landrace (L), Swedish Crossbred (X), the imported heavy breeds (K) and some minor breeds Swedish Finewool (Lf), Swedish Rya (Lr) and Swedish Crossbreds with crossbred parents (X*X). Interactions with region revealed that ram lambs (P, L, X) and lambs born to one-year old ewes (P and X) were in general given slightly too high adjusted weights in the northern part of Sweden. K-Group ram lambs tended to be slightly favoured in the western region. The adjustment factors were appropriate in the average flock size, while lambs after one-year old ewes and ram lambs were in most cases given slightly too high adjusted weights in small flocks. In Peltsheep the adjusted weights for triplets were significantly too high in large flocks. Significant interaction effects were found predominantly between production level and ewe age and between production level and sex which resulted in too high adjusted weights for lambs after both one- and two-year old ewes and for ram lambs in flocks with high production level. Interaction effects in the Lf-, Lr- and X*X-breeds were seldom observed and did not deviate from their respective breed groups. The results of this study do not motivate special sets of adjustments which consider region, flock size and production level. Key Words: management interactionflock-specific adjustments",

Significant increases in the frequency of BoLA w16 and A30, and a decrease in the frequency of A13, were found for the breeding bulls. The gene frequency of w16 exceeded 0.27 in latter years, which is higher than that reported for other breeds. BoLA typing results were associated with the young bulls' own performance test results for growth rate, conformation and semen quality. There was a statistically significant interaction effect of BoLA A8 and A10(w50) on growth rate. Animals carrying w25 had a significantly increased conformation score, while animals carrying A30 had a statistically significant decrease in the same trait. Significant negative associations of both A11 and A30 with semen characters were found. No significant associations of w16 with these performance traits were revealed.",

The size of pelt was more closely associated with general appearance graded in August than in November. The reverse situation was found for the quality of pelt. Fur defects observed in live minks reduced pelt quality. Size, quality and colour of pelts in scanblack males differed between farms, and in pastel males, differences between farms were found in pelt quality and clarity. The pelts of males with high scores in live animal grading were sold for 4–14 Finnmark more than medium or low scoring ones. Skin prices were more affected by the date of auction than by grading scores.",
