    "abstract": "Decade-scale regimes of sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis spp. have been observed in the productive coastal waters of the North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Eastern Pacific and the South-Eastern Atlantic. In each of these systems, the two genera fluctuate out of phase with each other. The subdominant genus may initiate a recovery while the other species is still abundant, so population growth is not necessarily a response to a vacant niche. Rather, it appears to be triggered by formation of one or a few powerful year-classes. At high population levels, quality of sardine and their eggs decreased in Japan, leading to decreased production and survival of eggs, poor year-classes and stock collapse. Excessive fishing of strong year-classes early in the recovery stage may prevent a species from assuming dominance, so influencing the natural succession of species. This may greatly alter the structure and functioning of an ecosystem. For example, a mesopelagic forage fish may replace an epipelagic one, with severe repercussions for predators that can only feed in the upper ocean, e.g. some seabirds. Biological factors also may influence the succession of forage fish. For example, off California, peaks in abundance of predatory species such as bonita Sarda, and chub mackerel Scomber, separate those of the planktivorous sardine and anchovy. In the Pacific Ocean, sardine distribution has change greatly. Compared with its range when scarce, a population at a high level of biomass can extend 1 000–1 800 miles farther along the coast and 400–2 200 miles farther out to sea. In different periods of high biomass, sardine did not always have the same distribution. In the 1930s and 1940s, near simultaneous fluctuations of sardine in the North-Western and North-Eastern Pacific were in phase. In the 1980s and 1990s, sardine in the North-Western and South-Eastern Pacific were fluctuating in phase. However, along the west coast of North America, sardine started their most recent increase later than in other regions of the Pacific Ocean. This increase is continuing, whereas sardine populations in the North-Western and South-Eastern Pacific have decreased both in catch and geographic distribution since the late 1980s. Therefore, the North-Eastern Pacific has moved out of phase with other major Pacific sardine populations. This may be because abundance of sardine in the California Current has not yet reached a level at which density-dependent effects exert a major influence. Sardine and anchovy in the South-Eastern Atlantic have been out of phase with populations in the Pacific Ocean, especially those off Peru and Chile. Over the last 300 years, episodic fisheries for Bohuslän herring Clupea harengus in Sweden coincide with periods of high anchovy abundance off California. Near simultaneous fluctuations of fish stocks in widely separated regions support the view that they are sometimes influenced by climate operating at a global scale. Changes of the gyre-scale circulation seem to be major factors in the decadal climate. In Australia, sardine have a wide range, but the less productive waters support a much lower biomass than is found in the other four systems. Engraulis occur in some systems from which Sardinops are absent, for example, Brazil, where they and Sardinella are segregated vertically in the water column.",

Both taxa show large expansions and contractions of range with changes in abundance. Populations of sardines also shift alongshore, possibly in response to climate change. At time-scales of several decades, fluctuations in catches of sardines and anchovies are seemingly dominated by long-term environmental variations which cause large and prolonged changes in abundance and give rise to \"regimes\" of sardine or anchovy. These long-term fluctuations are probably associated with persistent environmental changes of oceanic to global scale, there being coherence of trends in various sardine stocks on an oceanic scale and similarities between these changes and global, hemispheric and oceanic indices of the environment.",

    "abstract": "Three objective criteria for assessing sites being considered as marine nature reserves are developed and applied to a region of the west coast of South Africa, between the Groen and the Spoeg rivers, that has been mooted as a possible nature reserve. On a national and regional macroscale, zoogeographic analyses of 2 000 species of invertebrates were used to reappraise accepted marine biogeographic provinces. On a mesoscale and local scale, the intertidal community composition of rocky shores was examined and related to the physiographic habitat diversity. Five major zoogeographic regions are identified around the southern African coast, including a distinct Namaqua province. The Groen-Spoeg area, which receives no adequate conservation, is representative of both the major zoogeographic province that it falls in and the Northern Namaqua sub-province. A long period of limited human access as a result of diamond-mining has kept the shore near-pristine. On a global scale, the region is unique in the extent to which the system is dominated by dense assemblages of limpets. The species-composition of intertidal rocky-shore communities varies greatly according to the degree of wave exposure, and this small-scale variation, reflecting physiographic heterogeneity of the shore, can exceed large-scale zoogeographic variations. Therefore, in order to be representative, a reserve will need to incorporate small-scale variations in physical conditions and biotic composition, as well as large-scale geographic representativeness. The approaches used demonstrate that the Groen-Spoeg has a high priority for conservation; they are also generally applicable to the objective assessment of potential reserves, although they need to be coupled with other criteria, including socio-economic issues.",

    "abstract": "A total of 772 bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas was caught in Natal's protective \"shark nets\" between 1978 and 1990. Confusion in distinguishing C. leucas from C. amboinensis resulted in their catch data being combined from 1966, when data collection began, to 1977. The catch rate of the species pair declined until 1977, recovered until the mid 1980s, but subsequently declined again. The trend in catch rate of C. leucas alone for the period 1978–1990 was similar, with minima of 0,70 sharks·km-net−1·year−1 in 1978 and 0,95 in 1990, and a maximum of 2,08 in 1986. Recaptures of six tagged sharks suggest that the species is not highly migratory. Catches, particularly of immature sharks, were highest at the northernmost beaches. Most bull sharks were caught in summer and in turbid water (mean water clarity 2,0 m). The sex ratio of the catch was 1 male to 1,3 females. Sizes ranged from 74 to 213 cm precaudal length, with modes of 141–145 cm (males) and 171–175 cm (females). Size at maturity for both sexes was between 180 and 190 cm. The mating season was prolonged but with a summer peak. Seven gravid females were examined; the mean litter size was 8,7 embryos and size at birth was approximately 55 cm. Fluke infections were observed on 9 per cent of animals examined. As size increased there was a shift in diet, in terms of frequency of occurrence, from teleost to elasmobranch predominance. There was a high incidence of benthic and demersal species in the stomachs. Minor prey groups included mammals, birds, turtles, molluscs and crustaceans. Scavenging appeared to be important.",

The basis of knowledge of cephalopod phylogeny was formulated by Naef in the early 1920s, and his ideas and the progress made in the intervening 75 years are investigated. In the process, the roles that transitions between pelagic and benthic habitats played in the evolution of cephalopods are noted, and the possibility is advanced that the most recent \"oceanic anoxic event\" may have established a time marker for the divergence of some oegopsid families. The major advances since Naef's work are: 1. The unusual nature of Vampyroteuthis has been recognized; 2. The sister-group relationship between the Neocoleoidea and the Belemnoidea has been established, but requires further confirmation; 3. Monophyly has been confirmed for the Decapodiformes (new name), Octopodiformes and Octopoda by molecular and morphological methodologies; 4. The dates of origin of the Belemnoidea, Neocoleoidea, Sepioidea and fossil teuthoids have been extended to considerably earlier times. The major unsolved phylogenetic problems in need of immediate attention are the position of the Myopsida, relationships within the Sepioidea, the identification of the basal nodes within the Oegopsida, and the relationships of most \"fossil teuthoids.\"",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Cape commercial linefishery, established during the first half of the 19th century, currently consists of about 2 500 vessels (±20 000 crew), which land some 15 500 tons of fish each year. In spite of a long history, a lack of a long-term catch and effort data series has severely hindered the management of the fishery. This paper providcs commercial catch and effort data for three periods during the 20th century: 1897–1906, 1927–1931 and 1986–1998. Trends in catch per unit effort (cpue) were verified with additional data from the inshore trawl-fishery, from fishery-independent surveys and, where possible, stock assessment. According to a Linefish Management Protocol developed for the Linefishery, any stock demonstrating a historical reduction in cpue or catch contribution of more than 75% is to be regarded as overexploited. Evaluations based on present datasets support this arbitrarily determined reference point for cpue, but reveal that catch composition is a poor indicator of stock status and should be used with caution. In spite of technological advances such as the advent of combustion engines, nylon lines. echo-sounders, electronic navigational aids, onboard freezer facilities and larger vessels, declines in catch rate indicative of severe overexploitation (i.e. 75–99%) were observed for many important linefish species during the 20th century. Most of these were higher-trophic-Level species from the warm/temperate East Coast, several of which are also endemic. Life-history characteristics of the vulnerable species (i.e those demonstrating declines in cpue of >75%) include predictable location in time and space (either coastal migrant or resident), longevity (>15 years) and late maturity (relative to maximum age). Apart frorreduced productivity associated with stock depletion, other setbacks, such as ecosystem alteration, loss of genetic diversity and shor-term commercial extinction, are also anticipated. In order to rebuild depleted linefish stocks it is deemed essential to create additional marine reserves, dramatically improve enforcement, develop extensive public awareness programmes and substantially reduce commercial effort.",

Of these, only the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the European shore crab Carcinus meanas have become invasive. M. galloprovincialis, probably introduced in the late 1970s, is already the dominant mussel throughout the Cape west coast. As a result, indigenous intertidal mussels Aulacomya ater have been largely displaced, mussel standing stock has increased and the upshore limit of mussel beds has become considerably elevated. Implications include competitive exclusion of large limpets but enhanced recruitment of juvenile limpets, increased habitat availability for mussel infauna, reduction of habitat for algal infauna and enhanced food availability for predators, particularly terrestrial species. C. maenas was first recorded from Table Bay Docks in 1983 and currently ranges from Camps Bay to Saldanha Bay. Although it is a voracious predator, it appears unable to colonize wave-swept shores, so is unlikely to displace indigenous crabs, or to severely impact prey species on the open coast. Valuable conservation areas and mariculture sites in sheltered lagoonal areas are, however, threatened by it.",

However, the maturity scales used in ecological studies define some morphological categories which can be linked directly to microscopic development. Therefore, the overlap of GSI ranges for each morphological maturity category may be used to judge how well the GSIs represent the histological stages. Results have shown that the overlap is large and that GSI cannot be recommended as adequately reflecting the maturation process in squid. A morphological scale of maturity with possible broad applications in exploited families of squid is proposed as a better representation of the maturation process than GSI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The 1991 Benguela Ecology Programme Workshop on Seal-Fishery Biological Interactions outlined an approach to examine the qualitative effects of culls of a seal population on catches and catch rates of commercial fisheries. This paper applies that approach to examine the effects of possible culls of Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus on catches and catch rates of the bottom-trawl fishery for the Cape hakes off the South African west coast. The approach involves constructing a ?minimal realistic model? of the hake-seal system. The model considered here includes the two species of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, the Cape fur seal and an ?other predatory fish? component. Values for parameters of the model are derived from biological studies and by fitting to abundance indices for the hake and seal populations. The model is able to mimic the catch rate information for hake satisfactorily for a range of scenarios for the carrying capacity of the seal population, although the trend in hake abundance indicated since seal harvests commenced some four centuries ago until the start of the hake fishery in 1917 is, of course, questionable. The impact of the seal culls examined on the hake fishery is minimal (and can even be detrimental) for the base-case model, which takes account of both hake species and assumes that seals do not prey on the deep-water hake species M. paradoxus. This result is insensitive to changes to the values of most of those parameters of the model that are not well known. However, increasing the extent of predation by seals on M. paradoxus leads to greater projected benefits for the hake fishery under a future seal cull. It seems likely that a change in the future pattern of fishing to reflect a greater relative fishing intensity uponM. capensis would have a similar result. The conclusions of the paper will not necessarily apply to other southern African regions where the M. paradoxus : M. capensis is much lower than on the South African west coast.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Available data on phytoplankton and bacterial abundance and production off the coasts of southern Africa (to the 500 m depth contour) have been assembled and analysed for a network analysis of carbon flow in the Benguela ecosystem. Phytoplankton carbon biomass (from measurements of chlorophyll a) in the northern Benguela (2 558 300 tons) was considerably higher than in the southern Benguela (671 420 and 516 400 tons for the West and South coasts respectively). However, overall annual production (from C14-uptake measurements) was similar, 77 416 608, 76 399 973 and 78 988 020 tons C·year−1 respectively. Phytoplankton respiration and sedimentation losses were calculated as functions of primary production and therefore followed similar trends. From the most conservative estimates (mean bacterial biomass of 10 mg C·m−3 and average P:B of 0,2·day−1) bacterial biomass is 2–7 per cent of phytoplankton biomass in the northern and southern Benguela, and bacterial production is 3–5 per cent of primary production. Assuming a net growth yield of 30 per cent, bacteria would need to consume 9–15 per cent of the total primary production in order to meet their requirements for carbon consumption. Calculations based on a mean bacterial biomass of 40 mg C·m−3 and a mean growth rate of 0,5·day−1 in the upper 30 m of the water column show bacterial biomass to be 8–27 per cent of phytoplankton biomass and bacterial production to be 26–44 per cent of phytoplankton production. Bacterial carbon consumption requirements at these rates amount to 86–147 per cent of total primary production.",

Although salinity data suggest that the front may extend to a depth of at least 200 m, it is particularly marked in the upper 50 m where it can be defined in terms of both temperature and salinity. A horizontal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient of 4°C per 1° of latitude is typical near the coast, and the position of the zone of maximum gradient varies seasonally between, on average, 15 and 17°S, i.e. off southern Angola. The front corresponds to the convergence zone between the north-moving surface waters of the Benguela (modified Central Water) and the south-flowing Angola Current, which is of mixed tropical/equatorial origin and, as such, marks the northern boundary of the Benguela and the southern boundary of the intense shallow thermocline which is a permanent feature off Angola. An analysis of many observations by season shows that mesoscale poleward-directed tongue-like intrusions are a feature of the front. These are evident also in the synoptic SST distribution. Two case studies, one spanning a week in summer and the other a similar period in winter, of the SST show substantial short-term variability in the surface expression of the front, evidently related to the meteorology of the area. Double fronts are evident, on occasions, from satellite thermal infra-red imagery of the area. Their origin is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The upper ocean temperatures in the Angolan-Namibian coastal waters were anomalously high during March 1995, with positive temperature anomalies of up to 8°C. Maximum temperature differences were 30–50 m deep, reflecting a deepening of the thermocline from normal depths of 10–30 m. The unusually warm water mass covered the Angolan coast from Cabinda (5°S), the northern limit of the survey area, to at least 24°S off central Namibia. Higher than normal temperatures were observed as far south as Lüderitz (27°S). Satellite-derived SST and direct observations indicated that the seaward distribution of warm water extended more than 300 km from the coast. Surface drogues released inshore along the central Namibian shelf suggested a maximum southward extension by 3 March 1995. The warm event was associated with observed mortalities in sardine Sardinops sagax, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis and kob Argyrosomus inodorus off the coast. It also caused a southward displacement of sardine stocks from Angola, resulting in an increased availability of pelagic fish in Namibian waters. Conditions have occasionally been anomalously warm in Angolan and Namibian waters in the past, with the last major event in 1984. These events are known as Benguela Niños, because of their resemblance to the well known Pacific El Niño The 1995 Benguela Niño appeared to be associated with a positive subsurface salinity anomaly of 0.5 × 10−3 in Namibian waters and a negative (−4.0 × 10−3) surface salinity anomaly in Angolan waters, thought to be derived from the freshwater input of the Congo River.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium Catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. Catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.",

In females, however, there was a decline in concentrations of all three residues in animals with between 8 and 10 dentinal growth layer groups. A significant difference was found between residue levels in females before and subsequent to their first or second ovulation, suggesting that first-born calves receive the majority of the mother's load through lactation. Evidence is presented to indicate that primiparous females impart the majority of their load within seven weeks post-partum. Levels of PCBs, t-DDT and dieldrin differed significantly in different geographical areas, suggesting a degree of isolation of sections of the population.",

Statistical analysis indicated that the dispersion patterns of organisms within and between patches, and patch size and shape, explained most of the observed variability.

The investigation shows that the Angola–Benguela front is a permanent feature at the sea surface and is maintained throughout the year in a narrow band of latitude, between 14 and 16°S, with a general west to east orientation. Seasonal fluctuations of the front occur with regard to geographical location, width, seaward extent, temperature gradient and eddy formation in the frontal zone. The position of the front comes about as a result of a combination of factors, the most notable being wind stress, coastal orientation, bottom topography and north and south movements of warm and cold water associated with the Angola Current and the Benguela upwelling system.",

Seven species complete their entire life cycles in estuaries, 13 breed in the sea and migrate into the estuaries as juveniles, and two were freshwater species. Classification and ordination showed that the structure of the communities changed markedly during heavy freshwater flushing in the Palmiet and Kleinmond estuaries but not in the Bot. This was related to a massive emigration of species and individuals in the former two systems. Spawning by the permanent residents in spring/summer ensures minimal loss of eggs and larvae from the estuaries and allows juveniles to benefit from favourable summer and autumn conditions. Winter spawning by the marine migrants allows juveniles to enter the estuaries in the spring and early summer, after the winter floods but before the estuaries close. Differences in the species composition of the three estuaries are related to differences in the duration of connection between the estuaries and the sea.",

The results of these surveys are currently used to determine catch limits for anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax. Two main surveys are conducted annually, in winter to determine the strength of the year's recruitment and in summer to estimate the size of the adult stock. The results of the surveys conducted between 1990 and 1997 are presented and discussed in the context of the time-series of stock abundance. Distribution patterns, size structure and biomass levels are related to general trends in the life-history strategies of anchovy and sardine, as well as the major environmental features in the southern Benguela in the 1990s. The biomass of adult anchovy appears to be driven largely by the strength of the early recruitment, corresponding to fish spawned in the first half of the summer spawning season. The biomass of adult sardine, however, is better explained on the basis of the biomass of 2-year-old and older fish in the previous year's survey. Anchovy tend to move east with age, whereas sardine appear to move both north, along the south African west coast, and east with increasing age.",

    "abstract": "The life history of Argyrosomus japonicus off the east coast of South Africa was studied using biological, size composition and tagging data from fish caught in the estuaries, surf zone and nearshore marine environment of three coastal regions. Capture methods included hook and line (all habitats), seine-netting (estuaries and surf zone), and gill-netting and trawling (estuaries only). Median total length (TL) at maturity was 920 mm (5 years) for males and 1 070 mm (6 years) for females. All males > 1 100 mm TL (7 years) and all females > 1 200 mm TL (8 years) were mature. Adult fish are found predominantly in the nearshore marine environment, but they also frequent estuaries and the surf zone. Spawning takes place in the nearshore environment, from August to November in KwaZulu/Natal, and from October to January in the Southern and South-Eastern Cape regions. A large proportion of the adult population migrates to KwaZulu/Natal to spawn, although spawning may continue on their return to the Cape. Early juveniles of 20–30 mm (∼4 weeks) are recruited into turbid estuaries along the entire East Coast. They remain in the upper regions of the estuaries until they grow to about 150 mm. Juveniles > 150 mm are found in estuaries and in the surf zone. Fish < 400 mm are found throughout estuaries, but larger specimens are less abundant in the upper reaches. Fish < 1 000 mm generally do not migrate long distances, remaining as separate allopatric populations around their natal estuaries until they reach maturity. It is postulated that the protection from predation afforded by estuarine and surf-zone nursery areas has allowed A. japonicus to evolve a life history with a large size at maturity, thereby \"pre-adapting\" it to a migratory life-style. The life history of A. japonicus, including late maturity, the use of estuarine and surf-zone nursery areas, and a migratory adult population which forms concentrated spawning aggregations, is particularly vulnerable to the activities of man.",

During the spawning season, an important oceanographic characteristic of the Bight is the onshore intrusion of nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW). This feature favours larval survival by acting as a retention mechanism for both the prey and spawning products of sardine. The recruitment failure during the 1974/75 spawning season is attributed to the lack of penetration of the SACW, which resulted in high mortality of larvae during that period.",

The species composition of the prey items reflected the onshore-offshore distribution (and possibly the foraging depths) of different Odontoceti. Tursiops truncatus and Cephalorhynchus heavisidii were closest to shore and D. delphis and L. obscurus over the continental shelf.

Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to be attacked) is correlated with crab size. Larger species, such as the mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and Aulacomya ater and the periwinkle Turbo sarmaticus, clearly achieve a refuge in size, but predation on their recruits may influence their abundance and size structure. C. maenas rejected only the urchin Parechinus angulosus as a source of food. While it is conceivable that shifts in community structure, selection for thicker shells in molluscs and localized extinction of certain species may occur at high crab densities, it is predicted that C. maenas will only have a significant impact in areas protected from wave action.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper gives an overview of the main living marine resources of Namibia. It focuses on the scientific research conducted during the past decade as input to the management of these resources. The distribution and habitats of the most important harvested species and the main seabird populations are briefly described and discussed. The life histories of the major exploited species are summarized, with emphasis on spatial and temporal spawning patterns, dispersal of early life stages, migration patterns of recruits and adults, and diet, the latter particularly as it relates to potential competition between species. A number of commercially important species, such as the hake Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, deep-sea red crab Chaceon maritae, West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii, skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, southern albacore Thunnus alalunga and to a lesser extent Cape horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, southern African sardine Sardinops sagax and Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis, are distributed across national boundaries, requiring regional cooperation in research and management. The history and current status of the major fisheries is discussed. Over the past 30–40 years total annual catches have declined from a peak of around 2 million tons in the late 1960s to less than a million tons in the 1990s. This decline has been due, mainly, to a collapse in the sardine stock in the late 1960s and 1970s, and a reduction in the catches of hake and horse mackerel under a conservative management strategy in the past decade. Changes in the abundance and distribution of commercially important species, as determined by acoustic and trawl surveys and catch-based analytical methods, are presented. The effect of major environmental anomalies on the distribution and abundance of the resources in recent years is discussed. The most dramatic anomaly in recent years was the wide-scale advection of low-oxygen water into the northern Benguela from the Angola Dome in 1994, and the subsequent Benguela Niño of 1995, which appear to have severely impacted the Namibian sardine population and many other resources. The present socio-economic value of the Namibian fishing industry is given together with the broad policy, legislation and formal structures for managing the living marine resources.Keywords: BENGUELAEXPLOITATIONFISHERIESMANAGEMENTMARINE RESOURCESNAMIBIA",

    "abstract": "Roving creel surveys and aerial surveys of shore-angling were undertaken as part of a national investigation into linefishing in South Africa. Shore patrols utilized a random stratified sampling procedure to collect catch-and-effort data, and a questionnaire provided information on fishing effort, angler demographics, economics and attitudes towards current regulations. A total of 1 677 patrols, covering 19 616 km, was conducted between April 1994 and February 1996, during which period 9 523 anglers had their catches checked and 4 490 were interviewed. A further 16 497 km were covered by aerial surveys, when 22 609 anglers were counted. From the aerial surveys, angler densities were highest on the KwaZulu-Natal coast (4.65 anglers·km−1), followed by the Southern Cape coast (2.29 anglers·km−1), the Eastern Cape coast (0.36 anglers·km−1) and the West Coast (0.12 anglers·km−1). Catch rates varied from 1.5 kg·angler−1·day−1 on the Southern Cape coast to 0.45 kg·angler−1·day−1 on the KwaZulu-Natal coast. Total effort was estimated at 3.2×106 angler days·year−1 and the total catch was estimated at 4.5×106 fish·year−1 or 3 000 tons·year−1. Targeted species varied regionally, with elf Pomatomus saltatrix (29%) being the most sought after species on the KwaZulu-Natal coast, kob Argyrosomus japonicus (18%) on the Eastern Cape coast and galjoen Dichistius capensis on the Southern Cape coast (30%) and along the West Coast (50%). The catch composition by mass was dominated by P. saltatrix on the KwaZulu-Natal coast (29%), the Eastern Cape coast (26%), and on the Southern Cape coast (56%) and by white stumpnose Rhabdosargus globiceps (40%) on the West Coast. Although anglers generally supported the regulations currently governing the linefishery, the questionnaire results showed that knowledge and compliance of them was poor. A low level of law enforcement was found, except for in KwaZulu-Natal. Management of the linefishery is discussed in relation to the findings of this study.",

The relative dietary importance of prey size and prey type was assessed by calculating the carbon content of prey items. Sardine is an omnivorous clupeoid, ingesting both phytoplankton and zooplankton, with the relative importance of these two food types varying both spatially and temporally. Stomach contents were numerically dominated by small prey items, principally dinoflagellates, followed by crustacean eggs, cyclopoid copepods, calanoid copepods and diatoms. Virtually all prey items ingested by sardine were <1.2 mm maximum dimension, the particle size below which sardine only filter-feed. Despite the numerical dominance by phytoplankton, zooplankton contributed the major portion to sardine dietary carbon, small calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, anchovy eggs and crustacean eggs being the primary prey types. These results indicate that, like anchovy Engraulis capensis, sardine in the southern Benguela are primarily zoophagous, and contrast with earlier dietary studies on sardine in the region. However, the two species appear to partition their prey on the basis of size; sardine consume small zooplankton, whereas anchovy consume large zooplankton. This difference has been observed in other upwelling ecosystems where the two genera co-exist and is likely to contribute to the regime shifts observed between sardine and anchovy.",

    "abstract": "A total of 2 077 records of approximately 49 000 small cetaceans, including dedicated and incidental sightings and specimens, was analysed to define distribution patterns of the 28 species found within southern African waters. Distribution analyses reveal distinct component patterns, including cosmopolitan (found in all waters) and pelagic cosmopolitan (found in all pelagic waters) components, tropical, subtropical and warm temperate components of the Agulhas Current system, an Agulhas Bank component, a South and East Coast inshore component, and West Coast neritic and pelagic components. While the offshore distribution appears to be determined by water depth, possibly through distribution of the principal prey, longshore distribution appears to be determined by water temperature. The high diversity of small cetacean species found within the relatively small study region results from the wide range of zoogeographic components present. These components arise from the wide range of water temperature resulting from the warm Agulhas Current and the upwelling Benguela system.",

Under normal conditions, equilibrium states are possible with any one of these species dominating. A Mesodesma community south of Lima in Peru was investigated over 2,5 years, covering periods prior to, during and after the El Niño (EN) of 1982–83. It was revisited several times later. Growth, recruitment and mortality and, therefore, production of Mesodesma and Donax varied to some extent before EN. However, during the event Mesodesma became locally extinct and had not recolonized the area by July 1986, three years after the return of normal temperatures. Donax, which took over immediately after EN, never reached the densities of the former dominant Mesodesma. Emerita remained a rare species as well, whereas spionid polychaetes increased in importance. The medium-term effect of the exceptionally strong EN of 1982–83 appears to have been very marked on Peruvian sandy beaches. A comparison is made with other shallow-water communities of the upwelling system, and the importance of EN in terms of oscillations of clam stocks off Peru and Chile is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recent research developments on the ecology, dynamics and trophic position of copepods in the Benguela ecosystem are synthesized. Attention is focused on herbivorous species of the southern Benguela and how they cope with the physical and biological variability characteristic of this upwelling region. Copepods constitute on average approximately half of the total zooplankton carbon and. are most abundant during the upwelling season. They are able to maintain large population densities within local coastal upwelling areas by combining ontogenetically based vertical migration behaviour with features of the current system. Some species have developed finely tuned strategies to overcome periods of starvation between upwelling bouts by storing lipid reserves or by entering temporary developmental arrest. In situ measurements of production rates of local species are among the highest recorded for copepods. Despite an apparent excess of food, copepods exert only limited impact on the phytoplankton, removing on average <25 per cent of that available daily. Indirect estimates of carbon flux indicate that 11–25 per cent of copepod daily ration is used for egestion of faecal pellets. Copepods are the preferred prey of a wide variety of invertebrate and vertebrate predators. Large copepods in particular are important in the diet of commercially exploited pelagic fish. Localized areas of low abundance of copepods have been found in association with high densities of anchovy during peak spawning and recruitment periods. Copepods may therefore constitute a central limiting factor for pelagic fish production in the southern Benguela.",

The advective juxtaposition of these water masses establishes an arealy extensive vertical thermocline of remarkable intensity over the shelf. Temperature differentials of 8–10°C over depth intervals of as little as 10 m are not uncommon. Several manifestations of upwelling, viz. coastal, midshelf and shelf-edge, are evident in the results of three CTD-surveys made since 1982. Advective maintenance of the thermocline appears to compete with turbulent breakdown, a seasonal change of dominance occurring in parts remote from Agulhas Current influence. The gravitationally unstable salinity distribution could facilitate double-diffusive diapycnal mixing as well as ease turbulent mixing with winter cooling of the surface mixed layer.",

Its breeding distribution extends from Sylvia Hill, South West Africa (Namibia), to Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa. The non-breeding range extends from Sette Cama, Gabon, to Inhaca Island, Moçambique. Jackass penguins do not usually occur far off shore. The minimum total breeding population in 1978/79 was estimated to be approximately 134 000 birds. Numbers halved between 1956 and 1978 alone as a result of collapses in the South and South West African pilchard populations. Numerical decreases at Possession and Dassen Islands were particularly severe. Prior to 1956 numbers had also decreased, primarily because of large collections of eggs. Sealing activities and guano harvests may also have influenced trends. Only colonies at the periphery of the breeding distribution have increased numerically in recent times, and such increases appear to be related to the availability of suitable prey. Although the species breeds in captivity and is unlikely to become extinct, its continued survival in the wild probably relies on the continued good state of the pelagic fish resources.",

    "abstract": "In the face of ever-increasing requests for the proclamation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in South Africa, there is a need to develop an objective protocol for their evaluation. To achieve this, a methodology is described for which the acronym \"COMPARE\" (Criteria and Objectives for Marine Protected ARea Evaluation) is coined. COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, 14 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objectives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it compels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa.",

Neither multispecies fisheries models nor ecosystem models have yet proved more useful than single-species models to help manage fisheries, but they are considered to have the potential to provide better advice in both the long- and short-term. This paper addresses the impasse between the single-species, statistical approach and the multispecies, ecological approach. Will understanding ever lead to better management models? A comparison of the spatial dimensions, primary productivity, zooplankton biomass and fishery yields in different productive areas of the world indicates mat the Benguela, the Canary and the California currents are much less \"efficient\" in terms of fish production than the Humboldt Current or shallow shelf systems in temperate regions such as the North Sea, Georges Bank or the Bering Sea. Reasons for the discrepancies are advanced and the forcing mechanisms and limitations of fish production in the Benguela are outlined in terms of food limitation, critical gateways, mismatch of phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton and advective losses. The high apparent variability of key processes at small scales of space and time, equivalent to weather fluctuations, to some extent mask longer-term variations. Some suggestions on monitoring, based on good understanding of food production and consumption processes related to pelagic fish, are proposed to modify the assumption of average recruitment in exceptional years, and to provide data on the effects of longer-term climatic changes on productivity in South African coastal waters.",

Such results question the existence of a unified theory relating recruitment with the environment in upwelling areas. However, positive and negative correlations may both be valid if the relationship between recruitment and upwelling intensity is dome-shaped, as suggested by the \"optimal environmental window\" hypothesis. New evidence for such a relationship is presented for the Moroccan sardine Sardina pilchardus and the northern anchovy Engraulis mordax. Recruitment success increases with upwelling intensity when wind speed is low to moderate. In areas or periods of strong wind, recruitment success decreases with upwelling intensity. Using a comparative approach, the spatial and temporal reproductive dynamics of West African coastal pelagic fish are investigated. In some areas, the spawning season coincides with the upwelling season, but in other areas spawning and upwelling are out of phase. High reproductive activity coincides with the seasonal occurrence of wind speed of about 5–6 m·s−1, which is the value defined as the \"optimal environmental window\". This pattern is hypothesized to be the response, from an evolutionary point of view, of a long-term reproductive adaptation to the environment that maximizes recruitment success.",

The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore-anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus Sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A \"recruitment - spawner-biomass\" function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option. With the availability of site-specific data, the model can be applied to evaluate the effect of existing or proposed marine reserves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite high primary productivity, the yield of pelagic fish in the southern Benguela is relatively low compared to that in the Humboldt system. Part of the constraint may be the ability of pelagic fish to reproduce successfully in a strongly pulsed upwelling environment, where enrichment, retention and concentration mechanisms are less compatible than in Peru-Chile. Anchovy Engraulis capensis spawn upstream of the main upwelling centres on the food-poor, thermally stratified western Agulhas Bank, over a protracted summer season (October–February) when high wind speeds of 7–8 m˙s−1 are prevalent. Eggs spawned farther east, on the central or eastern Agulhas Bank, may be subject to increased cannibalism and advective losses, whereas those spawned farther west could be susceptible to heavy advective losses offshore during periods of strong southerly winds. Copepod concentrations are negatively correlated with spawner biomass on the western Bank and are inversely linked to high rates of gonad atresia in anchovy and reduced subsequent recruitment. There is a restricted area of suitable spawning temperatures (l6–19°C) on the western Bank, and fish outside that range appear to have less successful spawning, affecting recruitment; a reduction of the duration of spawning appears to decrease the chances of good recruitment. Oil content of pelagic catches on the west coast of South Africa suggests that good feeding conditions for adult fish are also favourable for growth of young fish in the nursery area. An inverse correlation between the numbers of recruits estimated in June and the strength of upwelling-favourable winds over the previous summer indicates the importance of advective loss of eggs and larvae in the transport and nursery areas. The presence of Agulhas Rings close to the shelf-edge, predators on juvenile anchovy, and the strength of upwelling on the West Coast could also be important factors affecting recruitment success. There seem to have been changes in the inshore-offshore distributions of spawning anchovy and/or their eggs over the past three decades, resulting in different recruitment responses to south-easterly winds.",

Adult C. brachyurus occur in the same geographic area but usually deeper, although there is some overlap in juvenile and adult depth ranges. Adult C. obscurus prefer the warmer subtropical and tropical waters north of the study area. Adult S. zygaena are found over deep reefs at the edge of the continental shelf. There was considerable dietary overlap between the three species, the prey of all three being dominated by small schooling fish, such as pilchard, and squid. For the three species, animals of total length >2 m took larger prey, such as elasmobranchs, with greater frequency, although they continued to prey on squid and schooling fish. It is postulated that the nursery areas are in the study area because of the abundance of food there, and that avoidance of cannibalism would be enhanced by the use of such nurseries.",

Observations on the feeding behaviour of the sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus over a seven-year period revealed this species to display at least four distinct foraging strategies. A particular strategy, or a combination of two or more, was employed depending on the size and type of prey being subdued. The four primary factors that appear to influence prey selection were prey size, availability and density, and scavenging. The behaviour of a prey species influences the predator's foraging and hunting behaviour. The success of the sevengill shark as an apical predator can be attributed, in part, to the feeding strategies it employs to subdue prey.",

    "abstract": "Sandy beaches constitute nearly 46 per cent of the coastline between the Cape of Good Hope and the Orange River along the west coast of South Africa. In addition, shores of mixed sand and rock make up a further 24 per cent although these are not considered here. Sandy beaches are therefore the dominant shore type along the coastline, and most are subject to high wave energy. There are two main ecological beach types along the study coastline: those that receive a high input of organic matter in the form of stranded kelp and those that do not. Neither type appears to support large stocks of surf-zone phytoplankton, but despite this, even beaches receiving no stranded kelp bear high standing stocks of infauna. This fact may be related to the location of the beaches alongside a highly productive upwelling region. Existing ecological information on sandy beaches along the Benguela coastline is reviewed and integrated to form a composite picture of present understanding of these beaches. The definition of a sandy beach includes not only the sandy intertidal zone but also the surf zone and sand dunes associated with it. Sandy beaches are characterized by the absence of attached primary producers, although in some parts of the world primary production by surf-zone phytoplankton has been found to be important. Secondary production by the infauna usually depends on matter imported into the system, except on beaches supporting important stocks of surf-zone phytoplankton. Imported organic matter is retained by beach sediments which act as a physical sieve, filtering large quantities of water with each wave and tide.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThere are two types of interactions between seals and commercial fisheries in South Africa: biological (potential competition for shared resources between the two \"predators\") and operational (conflicts during fishing operations). Using data for the 1980s, a comparison is made of relative consumption by different predators in South African waters. Seals and fisheries are not the major consumers in the system, but they do take comparable amounts. This has resulted in calls for a reduction in the seal population, but to date, no studies have shown that reducing seal predation of commercial species will make more fish available for the fisheries. Most fisheries are subject to some form of operational interaction with seals. These interactions include consumption of catches (operational consumption), disturbance of fishing operations (operational disturbance) and damage to fishing gear (operational gear damage); they vary in degree of severity, both seasonally and regionally. Estimates of the consumption by seals from fishing operations in South Africa show it to be a minimal percentage of fishery catches and a small proportion of the total predation by seals. Preliminary calculations of overall economic losses resulting from seal interference show this to be small in comparison with the wholesale value of the catches. Seals die as a result of fishing operations, and estimates of the potential mortality through entanglement, drowning and deliberate killing indicate this mortality to be of a magnitude that should be monitored.",

The community was investigated on the basis of distribution, abundance and diet of 51 species, constituting 95 per cent of the demersal fish biomass. Dietary studies revealed the existence of three major trophic groups, one containing species that prey on pelagic and nektonic organisms, a second dominated by predators that feed on benthic polychaetes and copepods and a third group containing predators of benthic crabs, demersal shrimps and fish. Well differentiated from these groups are a few species that prey mainly on jellyfish and ophiuroids. Because for most of the species, their trophic level changes with growth, they were divided into size classes which are analysed independently. To describe interactions between the size classes, a similarity index combining diet affinity with spatial coincidence was applied. Cluster analysis showed that, for Merluccius capensis, Raja straeleni, R. clavata and Trachurus trachurus, there is a large difference in both geographic distribution and dietary preference between the size classes. For species such as Hoplostethus atlanticus, Austroglossus microlepis and Coelorinchus flabellispinis, the different size classes seem to share the same ecological niche. Variation in the number of species and the parameters mean abundance and niche width are described to enhance knowledge of the general structure of the community.",

The response of copepods to changes in their food environment, as manifested by changes in rates of egg production, is compared for two different time-scales: seasonal-to-weekly in Long Island Sound, New York, and event-scale-to-daily off the coast of central Chile. The data sets discussed include a time-series of hydrographic and chlorophyll samples along with measurements of copepod egg production (made using an incubation technique) carried out each week in Long Island Sound during 1985 and a 25-day time-series of daily measurements of the same variables at a fixed station in the nearshore coastal upwelling zone off Concepción, Chile, in January 1986. Egg production was often low, suggesting food-limitation. Temporal variations in the fecundity of the copepods Temora longicornis and Acarlia tonsa in Long Island Sound did not follow changes in total phytoplankton biomass, but rather changes in the concentration of chlorophyll in the > 10 μm and > 20 μm size fractions. Off Chile, changes in fecundity of Calanus chilensis mirrored changes in both total phytoplankton biomass and the > 20 μm size fraction. This fact demonstrates that herbivorous copepods follow closely changes in their food environment and suggests that there is a close coupling between food quality of phytoplankton (in terms of particle size), ingestion and egg production by adult females.",

Two distinct communities of skates could be recognized on the basis of depth zonation, the boundary between these communities being at approximately 380 m water depth. These two skate communities have similar species components: the so-called biscuit skate community (the shallow one) has two crustacean specialists (Cruriraja parcomaculata, Raja wallacei), one fish specialist (R. alba) and two generalists (R. pullopunctata, R. cf. clavata); the so-named grey skate community has two crustacean specialists (Raja caudaspinosa, R. confundens) and two generalists (Bathyraja smithii, R. leopardus). The grey skate community appears to be a more complex and dynamic assemblage with higher diversity (at least 13 species) than the biscuit skate community (five species). In both communities the most common prey items were crustaceans and small demersal fish. Cephalopods and polychaetes were uncommon prey in most species. Other potential prey items commonly trawled but absent from the skates' diet included bivalve molluscs, gastropods and echinoderms. Although their importance has hitherto not been recognized, skates are important predators on the demersal crustacean and fish fauna in the Benguela ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The surface and subsurface waters of the Angola and Agulhas Current systems significantly influence the Benguela region and its living resources, and it is probable that the movement of Central Water, which plays a key role in the coastal upwelling process, is controlled by circulation of underlying Antarctic Intermediate Water (AIW) as well as by the dynamics of the overlying subtropical water. The movement of AIW can be inferred from a study of the t-s characteristics, and the data holdings and data base of the South African Data Centre for Oceanography facilitated this investigation. Key findings of the investigation, some confirming earlier theories and hypotheses, are as follows. The mean depth of the AIW core in the South-East Atlantic is 750 m, and in the South-West Indian Ocean, 1 100 m. Agulhas Current AIW, which is modified by Red Sea Water, becomes fresher en route because of entrainment and mixing of water from the south and west. Most of the Agulhas Current AIW per se retroflects east of 18°E. A poleward movement of AIW along the West Coast to around 32°S may be inferred from the salinity and oxygen data, with a freshening en route analogous to the Agulhas Current. Relatively fresh AIW (s < 34,35 × 10−3) is present off the South-Western Cape, the only part of the Benguela where the overlying virgin Central Water upwells. No statistically significant seasonal differences could be resolved.",

The main prey of seals above the age of one year was teleost fish, of which at least 28 species were identified. Overall, 74,6 per cent of the diet was teleost fish, 16,7 per cent cephalopods, 4,8 per cent crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, amphipods and isopods and 3,2 percent rock lobster. Within this overall dietary pattern there were marked regional differences. The importance of individual fish species in the diet was investigated from the numbers and the sizes of otoliths occurring in the stomachs, from which the identity and size classes of the prey species could be calculated. Again there were regional differences in the importance of different prey species. On the west coast of South Africa the most important species were anchovy and Cape hakes (each 23% of total diet), whereas on the south coast the important species were anchovy (17%), horse mackerel (14%), pilchard (12%) and Cape hake (14%). Off South West Africa the two dominant species were pelagic goby (52%) and horse mackerel (23%), anchovy and Cape hake constituting only 4 and 5 per cent respectively of total diet.

The former view has been employed to explain their abundance in upwelling areas because of their purported ability to utilize the primary producers efficiently, thereby shortening the food chain by one or two links. The literature regarding the trophic ecology of commercially important clupeids is reviewed, and it is concluded that there are few true phytophagists in the group. Most are omnivorous microphagists which derive the bulk of their energy from zooplankton. Results showing that these fish are herbivorous are deemed to derive from inadequate sampling strategies and the use of subjective analytical methods for the examination of stomach contents.",

On the Agulhas Bank, it is more likely that the low oxygen water is stabilized by shelf-edge upwelling, which causes a \"ridge\" of dense cold water to advect onto the Bank. This allows a semi-stagnant pool to develop to the west, where local decomposition can occur over a period of months below the stable intense thermocline.",

The model is based largely on studies conducted within the framework of the Benguela Ecology Programme and updates the results of an expert workshop held in Cape Town in September 1989. Small pelagic fish other than anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax, mainly round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi and mesopelagic fish, were important components of the food web in the southern Benguela. Severe balancing difficulties were encountered with respect to the semi-pelagic resources (hake Merluccius spp.) and demersal top predators (sharks), indicating the need for further research on the interaction of these groups with their ecosystem. The model is compared to other existing trophic flow models of ecosystems in major upwelling areas, i.e. the northern Humboldt Current (4–14°S), the California Current (28–42°N) and the southern Canary Current (l2–25°N), and to two independently constructed models of the northern Benguela ecosystem. These models are compared using network analysis routines of the ECOPATH software, focusing on the interactions between the five dominant fish species (anchovy, sardine, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus and hake) that support important fisheries in all systems. The upwelling systems rank by size rather than species dominance. The ratio of catches and primary production differs between systems, partly because of differences in fishing regimes. Predation on the five dominant fish groups by other fish in the system was the most important cause of fish mortality in all models. Fishery catches are generally a larger cause of mortality for these groups than predation by mammals. The ecological cost of fishing appears to be comparatively low in the southern Benguela, because catches are low compared with the primary production, but also because the fishery is relatively low in the foodweb. However, in view of the very tight foodweb demonstrated in the model. it is likely that an increase in fishing pressure would cause severe trade-offs with respect to other components of the southern Benguela ecosystem.",

Males mature at 950–1 300 mm TL and females at 1 250–1 400 mm TL. Reproduction is seasonal, and each cycle may take one year or longer, if there is a resting period between pregnancies. Litter size was correlated with female size and varied between 2 and 23. The largest embryo measured 425 mm TL. The hepatosomatic indices were negatively correlated to embryo length in both species. Prey was dominated by crustaceans, although cephalopods became important in larger M. mustelus. There was a good relationship between prey size and fish size. Free swimming malé M. palumbes measured 275–1 008 mm TL, whereas females were recorded up to 1 126 mm TL. M. palumbes males were most often taken from 100–180 m deep and females from 60–140 m. Males mature at 750–850 mm TL and females at 800–100 mm TL. Reproduction appears to be aseasonal in M. palumbes and litters of 3–15 young were recorded, with larger females having larger litters. The largest embryo recorded measured 340 mm TL. The timing of reproductive cycles could not be established, but a high proportion of non-pregnant females suggests that there may be a resting period following pregnancy. Crustaceans were the dominant prey type recorded, although larger prèdators ate a wider variety of prey types than smaller individuals. Although there was overlap in the prey taken by the two shark species, the composition of the diet was strongly influenced by the prey available in different habitats.",

    "abstract": "Long-term trends in the abundance and species composition of zooplankton are described. These trends are based on retrospective analysis of zooplankton samples collected in the St Helena Bay area off the South African west coast since the development of the pelagic fishery in the 1950s. Samples were selected from seven sampling programmes (1951–1967, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988–1996) that monitored the main commercial fishing grounds during peak recruitment (March–June). Abundance data are presented for size-based taxonomic groups, which include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates. Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996. Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2×103 to 7.2×105 ind·m−2 over the same period. Multiple regression analysis of the log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed long-term increase in zooplankton abundance could be a response to a long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area and augment their retention.",

In the 1950s, sardine dominated the pelagic fish component of the Benguela system. Abundance of this fish decreased in the 1960s and early 1970s and it was replaced by anchovy. Beginning in the early 1980s, sardine started to increase and anchovy to decrease in abundance. The decrease of the sardine resulted in collapses of colonies of African penguins between Lüderitz and Table Bay. Although colonies east of Table Bay increased, the overall population of African penguins fell by 25%. As the Benguela system started to revert to one dominated by sardine, penguin colonies between Lüderitz and Table Bay stabilized. Three new colonies were established in the vicinity of Table Bay, but the large colony at Dyer Island underwent a massive decrease. As a result, overall numbers of African penguins decreased by a further 19%. During shifts between regimes dominated by sardine and anchovy, African penguins that are breeding for the first time immigrate to colonies where food is plentiful. Inability of African penguins to cope with recent shifts between regimes may have resulted from increased competition for food with fishermen and seals during the 20th century.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOn 23 June 2000, the bulk ore carrier MV Treasure sank off western South Africa between Dassen and Robben islands, which individually currently support the largest and 3rd largest colonies of African penguins Spheniscus demersus. Subsequently, more than 19 000 penguins were oiled, almost twice the previous highest number of seabirds oiled during a single event in southern Africa (10 000 penguins after the sinking of the Apollo Sea in June 1994). About 19 000 oiled penguins were collected for cleaning and care and about 150 oiled adults died in the wild. Some 19 500 unoiled penguins were caught at Dassen and Robben islands and relocated to Port Elizabeth, 800 km to the east, to remove them from waters affected by the oil. Of all penguins caught, which amounted to 20% of the total species population, less than 2 000 died within the first month, considerably less than in the Apollo Sea spill. This can be attributed to improved transport of penguins and the rapid arrival at rescue centres of experts able to administer emergency care. However, resources were severely extended and mortality would probably have been considerably higher had large numbers of birds not been removed from the area affected by the oil. Many relocated birds returned to their home islands within a month of being released, but considerable disruption of pair bonds is expected to result from mortality, different periods in captivity and disruption of moult cycles. This is likely to result in decreased breeding success. Recruitment to colonies will also be reduced by substantial loss of chicks and eggs. Although more than 3 000 orphaned chicks were collected for captive rearing, an estimated 4 000 died at the islands before they could be rescued. Up to 20% of bank cormorants Phalacrocorax neglectus at Robben Island, the 3rd largest colony of the species in South Africa, died. There was low success in catching oiled cormorants and in saving those that were caught. Of 53 grown birds of four species of cormorant that were oiled and caught, only 17 survived. Captive rearing of bank cormorant chicks, which it was feared may have been orphaned, proved more successful. Spilt oil had minor impact on gulls, terns and shorebirds in the region.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAvailable information on direct measures of nitrate and ammonium assimilation by phytoplankton populations in the southern Benguela over the past 10 years has been synthesized into a convenient framework for comparison with other major coastal upwelling ecosystems. Based on a recent model, the southern Benguela and Peruvian upwelling systems are characterized by the highest potential for new production of the four systems analysed. Realization of this production potential is determined by biological and physical factors. The effects of ammonium and phytoplankton size on the f-ratio (and new production) have been considered. The proportion of ammonium in the inorganic nitrogen pool suppresses the f-ratio in a manner similar to that described for a number of other coastal regions. Related to the effect of ammonium and its supply by microbial processes is the partitioning of nitrogen resources among different size-classes of phytoplankton. Netplankton are characterized by higher f-ratios than both nanoplankton and picoplankton over the entire environmental range of nitrate encountered in nearsurface waters. A large netplankton component would appear to be essential for new production potential to be fully realized. Similarly, a comparison of two foodweb scenarios illustrates the positive effects of netplankton on production of higher trophic levels. The southern Benguela is apparently dominated by small (<10 μm) phytoplankton. This fact is illustrated in the calculation of regional f-ratios of 0,2–0,3, nearly half of what might be expected for a major coastal upwelling system. Such crude, size-based calculations may well be indicative of underlying causes for the lower pelagic fish yield in the southern Benguela than in other coastal upwelling ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modern threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries. Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are administered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.",

    "abstract": "African penguins Spheniscus demersus live in the Benguela and western Agulhas ecosystems off southern Africa. Their numbers decreased throughout the 20th century from at least 1.5 million to about 0.18 million adults, although different regional trends were apparent. They feed to a large extent on shoaling epipelagic fish, notably anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax, and regional trends in the abundance of penguins are associated with trends in the abundance and distribution of these prey fish. Many first-time breeders emigrate from colonies where feeding or other conditions at the time are unfavourable to more favourable breeding localities. This has led to both the extinction and formation of colonies. Food now may limit colonies at relatively small sizes, a fact attributable to industrial fisheries reducing the densities of forage fish. African penguins share their habitat with several other predators, with which they compete for food and breeding space. One of these, the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus p. pusillus, increased through the 20th century to 1.5 – 2 million animals at its close. Reported observations of predation by fur seals on seabirds have increased in recent decades and threaten the continued existence of small colonies of penguins. Stochastic modelling suggests that colonies of 10 000 pairs have a 9% probability of extinction in 100 years, so smaller populations should be regarded as \"Vulnerable\". However, in a period of prolonged food scarcity off southern Namibia, the regional population decreased from more than 40 000 pairs in 1956 to about 1 000 pairs in 2000, and many colonies numbering less than 1 000 pairs became extinct. The minimum viable population for African penguins is currently considered to be >40 000 pairs, likely of the order of 50 000 pairs, a figure equivalent to its level in 2000. The chance of survival of the species through the 21st century is tenuous.",

    "abstract": "A description is given of the research undertaken to provide a broad overview of the distribution and numbers of people who are subsistence or artisanal fishers and their activities along the coast of South Africa, to assist in the formulation of management protocols and to refine the existing definition of subsistence fishing. In total, 200 people were interviewed during the study, resulting in the identification of about 147 fishing communities, an estimated 28 338 fisher households and 29 233 people who potentially could be considered as subsistence fishers. Most of these fishers were found on the East Coast, more than 75% in southern KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transkei. They live in both rural and urban settings and harvest a variety of different species from intertidal, shallow subtidal and nearshore environments. Intertidal harvesting was the dominant activity along most of the East Coast, followed closely by subtidal harvesting. Harvesting nearshore resources that require the use of a boat was relatively unimportant there. By contrast, harvesting of nearshore resources was the most important activity on the West Coast, intertidal and subtidal resources being of lesser, but equal importance. Fish, rocky intertidal invertebrates and sandy beach invertebrates are harvested by subsistence fishers around the entire coast, whereas estuarine invertebrates feature prominently on the southern and northern regions of the East Coast. Certain high-value resources such as oysters (mainly Striostrea margaritacea), rock lobsters Jasus lalandii and Palinurus homarus and abalone Haliotis midae are also taken. These are not usually consumed by the fishers themselves, but are rather sold to generate income, and the people undertaking these activities should more accurately be considered as small-scale commercial fishers than subsistence fishers. A high proportion of the fishers in the South-Western Cape make use of motorized vessels. Fishers there also range over longer distances than those in other parts of the country. In general, however, subsistence fishers tend to live close to their point of harvest, mostly within 10 km. These results are discussed in the light of existing perceptions about what constitutes a subsistence fisher, and some of the difficulties in identifying criteria to define subsistence fishers and in developing appropriate management strategies are highlighted.",

Most previous descriptions of the West Coast (Benguela) system, including the baroclinic jet currents off the Cape Peninsula and Cape Columbine, the latter clearly diverging into a dominant offshore arm and a weaker inshore arm, have been confirmed. This baroclinic flow originates along the south-western margin of the Agulhas Bank. Measurements of the inshore features of the Agulhas Current have shown strong WSW – SSW flow aligned with the bathymetry, but with significant shelf-edge north-eastward return flows. The velocity differences between the surface and depth reveal barotropic dominance in all inshore areas and over the central Agulhas Bank. The West Coast outer shelf displays variable baroclinic effects, reflecting the importance of frontal features and cross-shelf flow. SSW flow on the outer eastern Agulhas Bank appears responsible for an offshore loss of eggs from this region. The funnelling of anchovy eggs from the western Agulhas Bank to the West Coast was clear, but this \"funnel\" was found to have holes through which substantial loss of eggs offshore is also probable. The currents on the Agulhas Bank and the West Coast are discussed with regard to the life histories of various commercially fished species, in addition to anchovy. The study concludes that hypotheses relating environmental factors and recruitment need to consider the variety of potential options in terms of life history contained within the prevailing current system.",

Distribution maps from all surveys are presented and the biomass estimates considered most reliable documented. A series of distribution maps tracing movements of three anchovy year-classes over a four-year period is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the surveys in migration studies. The major findings of the survey programme have been that anchovy are generally considerably more abundant and widespread than was thought to be the case prior to the surveys, that the pilchard resource has recovered substantially in recent years, and that the round herring resource, about which little was known prior to the surveys, is probably of the same order of magnitude as the anchovy resource and is probably underexploited. The anchovy and pilchard resources are currently managed through procedures based largely on the acoustic estimates of biomass and their estimated precision. The role of these estimates in the management procedures is discussed in some detail.",

These studies were of two forms, random sampling of the dietary preference and constituents of the hake caught during daylight only and intensive sampling of stomachs with food throughout a 28-hour cycle. From the index of relative importance, crustaceans were shown to be most important in the majority of length classes of hake studied, with mesopelagics (fish and cephalopods) and other hake also important. Differences by hake species, by predator size, by geographical location and by season were evident. The Cape hakes, which constitute some three-quarters of the demersal fish biomass in the area, are deduced to play a major role in the marine faunal environment, both as predators and prey, and some base-line figures of the quantities of different food items consumed by the resource are presented. Hake are largely opportunistic feeders and it is concluded that they can adapt to perturbations in the availability of prey, whether they be triggered by environmental cause or by, for example, purse-seining of particularly mesopelagic fish.",

Anchovy was the most important prey item, contributing about 31 per cent of all food eaten, followed by pelagic goby (18%), hakes (15%) and zooplankton (8%). Virtually all the hake component of the diet is scavenged from fishing vessels, and of the other main prey items only anchovy is targeted by commercial fishermen. It is estimated that African penguins decreased in abundance by about 400 000 birds between the mid 1950s and the mid 1980s and Cape gannets by 180 000, but that Cape cormorants increased by some 500 000 birds. The overall consumption by these three species decreased by about 35 000 tons wet mass between the two periods. Past estimates of consumption by seabirds off south-western Africa are reviewed. In the 1980s there were estimated to be, on average, about 2 million locally breeding seabirds and 3 million migrant seabirds in the region. The overall biomass of seabirds was about 5 000 tons live mass and the annual gross production about 700 tons live mass.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since commercial use of southern African seaweeds began in the early 1950s, six genera (Ecklonia, Laminaria, Gracilaria, Gelidium, Gigartina and Porphyra) have been collected or harvested, and most of this material has been exported for use in various colloid industries. Several other genera show potential for either harvesting (e.g. Hypnea) or mariculture (e.g. Suhria). Currently, the southern African industry earns more than 2,3 million US $ per annum and provides employment for approximately 2 000 people (half of them part-time), mostly in economically depressed rural areas. In this article, available data on commercial and research aspects of the seaweed industry and the regulations governing exploitation of natural populations on the coasts of southern Africa (South Africa, Transkei, Ciskei and Namibia) are considered. Where there is a lack of biological information necessary for further development of the local industry, future research directions are suggested.",

The combination of differential diel vertical movements of the various stages, seasonal ontogenetic migration and the resultant differential exploitation of cross-shelf advective processes and longshore current regimes play an important role in the maintenance of populations within the coastal upwelling areas of the southern Benguela ecosystem. At lower latitudes, C. carinatus utilizes true diapause in its life-cycle strategy to bridge the 8–10 month period between upwelling seasons. In the Benguela, however, the presence of an inshore active and an offshore resting component enables local C. carinatus populations to maintain a perennial presence. Because of a protracted upwelling season and occasional upwelling in winter, seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of C. carinatus in the Benguela ecosystem, ranging from 4 700·m−2 in winter to 11 200·m−2 during peak upwelling, are not as striking as they are in tropical upwelling regions.",

With recently developed methods it was possible to determine that 21,9 per cent of this egg mortality was the result of egg cannibalism by anchovies. Some 76,4 per cent of 1 500 anchovy stomachs contained anchovy eggs and the mean number of anchovy eggs in such stomachs was 14,2. Of 577 sardines Sardinops sagax caught in the anchovy spawning area, 62,1 per cent contained anchovy eggs in their stomachs, the mean number of eggs present being 19,1. When considering only collections in which sardines and anchovies occurred together, 77,0 per cent of the anchovies and 86,2 per cent of the sardines had eggs in their stomachs. The mean number of eggs per stomach was 6,6 in anchovies and 27,6 in sardines in these collections. The mean number of anchovy eggs per kilogramme wet fish mass was 335 and 757 for anchovy and sardine respectively. Although the contribution of egg predation by sardines to the total anchovy egg mortality could not be estimated quantitatively, it was obvious that it is important.",

The spawning surveys were conducted each November between 1983 and 1985, predominantly on the Agulhas Bank. Recruit surveys were conducted in autumn 1985 and 1986, mainly on the West Coast. The spawning fish were widely distributed across the continental shelf, whereas recruit concentrations were highest close inshore. Employing a target strength per kilogramme expression for herring Clupea harengus, the spawning biomass in 1984 was estimated at 1,06 million tons and that in 1985 at 0,98 million tons. Similarly, recruit biomass in May/June 1985 and June 1986 was estimated at 310 and 466 thousand tons respectively. From an analysis of error in the latter two estimates, it was considered approximately 80 per cent certain that the recruitment in 1986 was greater than in 1985. The estimates of spawning biomass are 3–4 times higher than earlier estimates made by Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) of commercial catch data, and suggest that the stock is less seriously threatened by present catch levels than was indicated by VPA. It is concluded from the distribution and age structure of the spawning population that the VPA estimates are invalid because of the failure of commercial vessels to sample the major part of the adult population.",

The otoliths of all three species displayed distinct daily growth rhythms. Starting from the core, regular microstructural patterns of deposition produced distinct increments which could be enumerated from the rugose surface of prepared otoliths. During the early stages of growth, deposition of the increments was daily, but this regularity was lost with age. Checks or discontinuities, which may record periods of perturbation or stress of the fish, are frequent in both species of hake and in kingklip. In the two Merluccius species the growth increments contain sub-daily units and patterns of increment deposition, probably dependent upon the combined effect of temperature variation and migratory behaviour. Sub-daily units were not found in the increments of kingklip otoliths. As kingklip always remain close to the bottom, the absence of sub-daily units may be related to the day-to-day stability of the benthic environment combined with their infrequent feeding periodicity. The greater intensity of the seven-day cycles in the rings laid down in winter would seem to indicate that such cycles may be related to environmental fluctuations produced by changes in upwelling intensity.",

Available physical oceanographic data, particularly the seasonal distribution of temperature and cube of the wind speed, are examined and reference is made to two case studies consisting of images derived from NOAA-7 and NIMBUS-7, to demonstrate mesoscale variability in sea surface temperature, near-surface chlorophyll and the surface circulation pattern. Surface distributions of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll revealed no significant longshore gradients in the region that could explain the biological boundary, but the wind data suggest that the rate at which kinetic energy is supplied to the surface layers, and hence the turbulent mixing, decreases substantially north of 24°30′S. The effect is seen in vertical temperature profiles along the coast as appreciably stronger stratification on the equatorward side of 24°30′S. The NIMBUS-7 imagery provides evidence of a complex surface circulation pattern in the same region, a factor which may further increase turbulent mixing. It is therefore suggested that it is the combined effect of changes in circulation and turbulence/stratification which causes the biological discontinuity.",

The first principal component, accounting for over 55 per cent of the variability in monthly mean sea level, was a near uniform rise and fall everywhere along the west coast of southern Africa. The spectrum of this large-scale structure showed a strong interannual trend, which correlated well with long-term trends of temperature anomaly over the entire South-East Atlantic, and a high-frequency term, which could not be resolved at a time period of one month. The second principal component showed the contrasting response of the northern and southern sites on a seasonal scale, and it could be correlated with seasonal wind data.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Cape gannet is endemic to the southern African coast where it currently breeds at six islands: Mercury, Ichaboe and Possession off South West Africa and Bird (Lambert's Bay), Malgas and Bird (Algoa Bay) off South Africa. Previously, breeding also occurred at Hollams Bird, Halifax and Seal (False Bay) Islands. Equivocal records for Marcus, Dassen and Dyer Islands are not accepted. Off South West Africa, gannets were breeding at Hollams Bird, Mercury and Ichaboe Islands at least as early as 1828, but they only occupied Halifax and Possession Islands sometime between that date and c. 1885, possibly as a result of displacement of gannets from Ichaboe Island during exploitation of accumulated guano deposits in the early 1840s. Gannets bred at Hollams Bird Island until at least 1938, but had ceased breeding at Halifax Island by 1928. Off South Africa the earliest records of breeding are 1648, 1687, 1755 and 1912 for Malgas, Seal (False Bay), Bird (Port Elizabeth) and Bird (Lambert's Bay) Islands respectively. Gannets have not been reported at Seal Island since the late 17th century. On the west coast of Africa the Cape gannet is a regular nonbreeding winter visitor as far north as 4°20′N 6°00′E, but west of 6°E it is rare. On the east coast of Africa it is a common winter visitor as far north as Delagoa Bay, but farther north it is rare. Within its normal range the Cape gannet seldom occurs farther off shore than 100 km; it hardly ever moves inland. Aerial censuses of Cape gannets at breeding islands in 1967, 1969, 1978, 1980 and 1981 are compared with an aerial census conducted in 1956 and other published estimates of abundance. Between 1956 and 1980 the estimated number of breeding pairs at all colonies decreased from c. 150 000 to c. 80 000 and numbers decreased at all three extant gannetries off South West Africa. These decreases are attributed to a greatly diminished food resource following the collapse of the South West African pilchard stock after the late 1960s. The number of gannets decreased at Bird (Lambert's Bay) and Malgas Islands between 1956 and the late 1960s but subsequently increased, trends that are related to performances of the Western Cape pilchard and anchovy resources respectively. At Bird Island (Algoa Bay) gannets were up to 3,5 times more abundant in the late 1970s than in 1956. Other marine resources located east of Cape Point have shown similar large increases in recent years. Rates of increase of gannets at islands off South Africa during the 1970s would have required an unrealistically high survival for the first year had other population parameters remained constant. It is possible that birds emigrated from the South West African Islands. Few gannets have been reported oiled, and conservation of the species seems to be mainly affected by greatly reduced prey availability and injudicious guano harvesting. Human exploitation of juvenile gannets off the West African coast is difficult to assess.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Upwelling regions are the most complex habitats in which dinoflagellates produce red tides, but the flora is not unique. Many species also bloom in nutrient-enriched, non-upwelling systems, share the collective dinoflagellate trait of low-nutrient affinity, and can achieve relatively fast growth rates. Blooms occur over the range of nutrient – mixing – advection combinations found in upwelling habitats, rather than being restricted to the high-nutrient high-irradiance low-turbulence conditions posited by Margalef's classical Mandala and its Bowman et al. and Pingree versions. The bloom species are primarily ruderal strategists (R-species), which typify \"mixing – drift\" life-forms adapted to the velocities associated with frontal zones, entrainment within coastal currents, and vertical mixing during upwelling relaxations. Collectively, dinoflagellates appear capable of surviving fairly high turbulence spectra formed at representative Kolmogorov length scale – wind speed conditions. This biophysical protection might be the result of cell size-facilitated entrainment within the micro-eddies formed during turbulent energy dissipation. The swimming speeds of 71 clones of dinoflagellates are compared and related to reported rates of vertical motion in coastal upwelling systems. There are slow and fast swimmers; many exhibit motility rates that can exceed representative in situ vertical and horizontal water mass movements. At least four dinoflagellates from upwelling systems form chains leading to increased swimming speeds, and may be an adaptation for growth in coastal upwelling habitats. Red tides are frequent and fundamental features of upwelling systems, particularly during intermittent upwelling relaxations, rather than dichotomous (sometimes catastrophic) interruptions of the diatom blooms characteristically induced by upwelling. Successional sequences and the \"red tide\" zone may differ between upwelling and non-upwelling systems. In the latter, red tides diverge from the main sequence and are appropriately positioned in the Mandala's ecological space of high nutrients and low turbulence. An amended Mandala based on Pingree's S-kh model and the Smayda and Reynolds life-form model is presented to accommodate the range of red tide development and their successional routing found in coastal upwelling systems. Ecophysiological data support the Pitcher and Boyd seeding mechanism model, which can lead to red tides in upwelling systems. Nutrients, phyto-stimulation and grazing pressure as triggering factors in upwelling-system red tides are considered. Some red tides may be stimulated by nutrients and growth promoting factors excreted by migrating shoals and \"boils\" of c1upeoid stocks, with selective zooplankton grazing contributory. Substantial collapses in grazing pressure may be essential in anoxic red tide events. The mass mortalities that accompany anoxia, common to the Benguela and Peru upwelling systems, may be a trophic control mechanism to maintain biogeochemical balance and regional homeostasis, which are vital to upwelling ecosystem dynamics. Some traditional concepts of phytoplankton ecology may not completely apply to dinoflagellate bloom events in coastal upwelling systems.",

There has been long-term stability in numbers of Peruvian boobies Sula variegata, whereas the numbers of Cape gannets Morus capensis decreased as sardine decreased in southern Africa. Numbers of Peruvian pelicans Pelecanus (occidentalis) thagus are significantly related to the combined biomass of anchovy and sardine in Peru. They have been stable in the long-term. There have been ongoing severe decreases in populations of the Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti and the African penguin S. demersus, both of which are now Vulnerable. Common causes for the decreases have been collection of eggs, loss of habitat through exploitation of accumulated deposits of guano and competition with fisheries for food. Short-term decreases in guanay cormorants, Peruvian boobies, Peruvian pelicans and Humboldt penguins have followed El Niño events. Time-series of indices of the abundance of guano-producing seabirds date from 1908 in Peru and 1896 in southern Africa. They are significantly, negatively correlated in the period prior to the development of intensive fisheries on sardine and anchovy, suggesting that the out-of-phase nature of the anchovy and sardine populations in the Peru and Benguela systems pre-dated commercial exploitation of these fish resources.",

Results show that more than 90% of shore-anglers have incomes which lie in the highest two quintiles of the distribution of incomes, and that <5% of rock-and-surf anglers were members of a household that was in poverty. Estimated mean income of commercial skiboat operators also fell into the upper 40% of incomes, but the estimated incomes earned by their crew barely exceeded the poverty line. A low income elasticity of demand was estimated for fishing trips by recreational anglers, predicting that the growth in demand for recreational fishing trips will slow with economic growth. The price elasticity of demand was also estimated to be low, indicating that the levying of an annual licence fee will not be effective in reducing effort. The macroeconomic importance of the recreational and commercial fishery was estimated from expenditures on fishing trips and income earned by commercial operators and crew, and when multiplier effects are taken into account, the fishery is estimated to contribute 1.3% of the GGP of the coastal economics, and to generate employment for 131 500 people. Shore-angling was found to be most significant, contributing 76% of the GGP attributable to the fishery.",

    "abstract": "The dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus is an important linefish species that is abundant in South African waters between Cape Agulhas and the Moçambique border. The juveniles (<1 070 mm) occur inshore, where they are targeted by surf-zone and estuarine anglers, and the adults are caught mainly beyond the surf by recreational and commercial linefishermen. Yield-per-recruit (Y/R) and spawner biomass-per-recruit (SB/R) models were applied to the South African dusky kob stock, with accommodation for different inshore (F inshore ) and offshore (F offshore ) fishing mortality. It is shown that, as a result of high juvenile mortality (F inshore = 4–6-fold F SB25 and 6–10-fold F SB40), dusky kob were exploited far beyond optimal (F SB40) and threshold (F SB25) fishing limits, and that SB/R was 1.0 – 4.5% of the pristine value. This is indicative of severe stock depletion and of recruitment overfishing. Based on the bag frequencies of 16 367 angler outings, it is clear that the current recreational bag limit of 10 fish·angler−1·day−1 does not limit fishing effort. Three alternative management scenarios (combinations of F inshore and minimum size at first capture) are discussed, which elevate SB/R above 25%SB/R F=0, increase Y/R beyond current levels, and equitably apportion Y/R inshore and Y/R offshore . Whereas it would take about 41 years for any of the alternative scenarios to attain maximum SB/R, a 3-fold increase is expected after 9 years and a 6.0 – 6.4-fold increase after 20 years. The increase in spawner biomass associated with the alternative strategies is expected to increase both inshore and offshore yield dramatically (as a result of higher recruitment), even though Y/R inshore would be 69 – 70% of its current value. It is concluded that, because of the susceptibility of A. japonicus to recruitment overfishing, the species may have been overexploited in fisheries throughout its wide distributional range, and that accurate life history data and assessment-based regulations are essential for successful long-term management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To develop a management strategy for informal fishers, a necessary first step is information about the nature of these fishers, their numbers and their socio-economic status. To accomplish this, a survey of socio-economic conditions and use of marine resources was undertaken in 1999 at 20 localities where fishing occurs around the coast of South Africa, concentrating on subsistence or small- to micro-scale artisanal commercial fishers. In each locality, 16–31 \"fisher households\" were surveyed by questionnaires, focus-group discussions and interviews with key informants. Demographic analyses revealed a low level of migrancy (∼5%), an average of 5.3 persons per household and a mean age of 27. Only ∼20% of fishers were women and ∼15% were children. Poverty was prevalent: unemployment averaged 40.3% (much higher than the national norm of 29.3%). Mean adult equivalent income per month spanned R193–R735 among regions, and was not correlated with size of settlement. Education levels were low, only ∼33% of people >20 years old having completed primary school. Migrancy was highest in rural areas (but still much less than the national norm), intermediate in towns and least in metropolitan areas. Household size, participation of women and poverty all followed similar trends. Comparing regions, the East Coast and the province of KwaZulu-Natal had higher migrancy rates, larger household sizes, greater poverty, and greater participation by women in fishing, than on the South and West coasts. Household expenditure on food was ∼R450 per month on the South-East and KwaZulu-Natal coasts and ∼R750 on the West Coast, and exceeded 60% of income (a measure of \"food security\") in about half the households surveyed. Harvested resources were sold, consumed or used as bait. In all regions, the two most frequently harvested resources were fish (mostly sold, predominantly fished by men) and intertidal rocky-shore invertebrates (largely consumed, and involving women to a greater degree). On the West Coast, rock lobster Jasus lalandii was the third-most important resource, but on the South and KwaZulu-Natal coasts this species was replaced by estuarine invertebrates. Abalone Haliotis midae, oysters, sandy-beach invertebrates and kelp or seaweeds made up the balance. Diversity of harvested resources increased west to east, following biogeographic trends. The resources could be divided into those of high value (rock lobsters, abalone and, to a lesser extent, fish) and those of lower value (such as limpets, mussels and bait organisms). It is argued that high-value resources are best used to create micro- and small-scale commercial enterprises that can serve to uplift poor fishers. Low-value resources constitute subsistence resources, for which preferential rights should be established for subsistence fishers, including development of exclusive-use zones where necessary. Emerging characteristics of fishing communities that were helpful in defining subsistence fishers in the South African context were poverty, harvest for self-use (whether by consumption or sale to meet basic needs of food security), use of low-technology gear, and concentration of effort on or from shores or in estuaries. At least portions of the catches of all resources are sold, and the majority of equipment is purchased, so any definition of subsistence fishers cannot exclude those who sell part of their catch or do not use hand-made equipment. Some success was evident with co-management, encouraging further exploration of this style of management for subsistence fishers.

Seven endemic species were recorded, the remainder having Indo-West Pacific or western Indian Ocean distributions. Most sharks were between 0,5 and 1 m long and most of the Myliobatiformes were 0,5 m in disc width. The small sizes of trawl-caught elasmobranchs indicates that the Tugela Bank functions as a nursery area for several species. None of the species examined exhibited diel patterns in frequency of occurrence, but Gymnura natalensis, Himantura gerrardi, Dasyatis chrysonota chrysonota, Sphyrna lewini and the rhinobatids occurred more frequently in warmer months. One species, Halaelurus lineatus, was more frequently taken during cooler months. Himantura gerrardi, Sphyrna lewini, Mustelus mosis and Rhizoprionodon acutus were recorded more frequently in shallower trawls (20–33 m) and G. natalensis and D. c. chrysonota more frequently in deeper trawls (33–45 m). Trawl-induced mortality was shown to be species specific, S. lewini having the highest mortality (98%). Based on catch rates recorded and trawl fleet effort, it is calculated that 44 600 elasmobranchs were caught by Tugela Bank trawlers from 1989 to 1992. About 57% of these were returned to the water alive. These figures are compared to catches made by recreational anglers and the Natal Sharks Board during the same period.",

The estimation of growth parameters in wild octopus populations is essential to management of the fishery. As there are problems with methods based on length-frequency modal analyses for describing growth from field data and there is a lack of age determination techniques for octopod species, estimation of the growth rates of natural populations is currently difficult. The present work describes the use of beaks to determine the age of O. vulgaris, using a new method based on a sample of beaks from 25 animals caught in the area in 1993. After sectioning different planes of the beaks embedded in resin blocks, they were analysed to select the best with which to observe growth increments. The sagittal plane (from outer to inner) revealed a pattern of increments of similar width in the internal rostral area of all the beaks analysed that are possibly related to the age of the animal. The number of these increments does not exclude daily deposition.",

    "abstract": "Orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus are unusual fish. They form dense aggregations that have fuelled lucrative fisheries at great depths (600–1 400 m), especially off Namibia, New Zealand and Australia. They are thought to be very long-lived (>100 years, maturity at 22 – 40 years), and to have exceptionally low natural mortality (M = 0.045–0.064 year−1) and slow growth rates (K = 0.055–0.070 year−1). In addition, they spawn large eggs and have low fecundity. These factors combine to make orange roughy highly susceptible to overfishing; most stocks are below 30% of pristine levels. Assessments are obtained from indices of catch rate and trawl, acoustic and egg surveys. Acoustic estimates are the most direct, but are confounded by the species' low target strength (−50 to −53 dB)–attributable to the wax-filled swim bladder. Extracellular wax esters are stored in abundance and comprise mostly mono-unsaturated fatty acids, with low concentrations of the ω-3 fatty acid family. This unusual composition (resultant from the species' diet) ensures neutral buoyancy. Stock separation has been inferred mainly from biological studies, but genetic studies have also found differences among stocks within New Zealand and Australia. Deep-water habitat may be damaged by trawling operations and may take many years to recover, so in some quarters there is a call for a portion of suitable habitat to be set aside for preservation. Although Namibian orange roughy are shallower, smaller and younger than those in other stocks, the Namibian fishery sustained high catches for only a few years before quotas were reduced, from 12 000 to 1 875 tons. Three management lessons are suggested for developing orange roughy fisheries based on the Namibian experience: (1) imposition of catch limits during exploratory fishing; (2) starting the acoustic surveys earlier in the fishery, if possible; (3) greater reliance on trends in catch rate until a survey series has been established.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA). Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this, the Chief Director of Marine & Coastal Management (MCM), the authority responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the following definition: Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food security. This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of \"commercial fishing\" in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and the SFTG defined \"small-scale commercial fishers\" as a distinct component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.",

    "abstract": "There are currently three dominant approaches to fisheries stock assessment: analysis of catch-at-age data; simple models of biomass dynamics (often called surplus production models) that rely only on catch and some index of abundance; and analysis of length frequency data. A key characteristic of all these methods is that they rely primarily on one type of data and ignore most of what is known about the biology of the species in question and what has been learned from fisheries elsewhere. Other information is sometimes included subjectively after the stock assessment is complete. The first major trend in assessment methods is developing ways of incorporating all that is known about the biology of a species into a single unified assessment procedure. The second major development is in methods of incorporating uncertainty in stock assessment, using statistical decision theory. At present few agencies have formal methods for treating the uncertainty inherent in stock assessment, and therefore uncertainty is often ignored. A number of trends in fisheries management are reviewed, including adoption of formal harvest strategies, recognition that fisheries management is a matter of decision-making and risk-taking, and the use of Monte-Carlo evaluation of fisheries management options. Future trends in stock assessment and management will likely include more attention to the behaviour of fishermen in response to regulations, more involvement of user-groups in decision-making, much more allocation of property rights, including complete privatization of some fisheries, and demand for evaluation of cost effectiveness of research and management activities. Threats to commercial fisheries as now known are discussed, including growing allocation to recreational and aboriginal users, environmentalists and the impact of aquaculture.",

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the relative importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid- to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed.",

In terms of numbers removed, bait-collecting is thus no threat to the prawn populations at Langebaan Lagoon, although there are signs that sandprawn densities and modal body sizes have been reduced in areas of intense bait-collecting. In addition, bait-collecting disturbs large quantities of sediment and, inadvertently, this results in the disturbance of other components of the biota. Approximately 54 g of macrofauna is disturbed with each bag limit of 50 prawns, amounting to an estimated maximum of 1 300 kg of macrofauna being disturbed annually by bait-collectors. Although the fate of this disturbed macrofauna has not been completely determined, the results of predation experiments suggest that approximately 80 per cent of the biomass is subsequently preyed upon by scavenging gulls.",

In all, 51 690 fish larvae, representing 44 families and 85 species, were collected. The Gobiidae and the Clupeidae were the two dominant families, representing 74 and 19% of the larvae respectively. The most abundant species were the river go by Glossogobius callidus and the estuarine round herring Gilchristella aestuaria, which contributed 67 and 19% respectively. The proportion of species which are dependent on estuaries to some degree contributed 54% of the total number of taxa. Environmental variables correlated with larval densities in each estuarine-association group and were species-specific. Turbidity and salinity accounted for 45% of the variation in larval densities in the estuarine-dependent group, where densities were greater at higher turbidities and lower salinities. Densities of larvae peaked between November and April (late spring, summer and autumn) and declined to a minimum between the end of May and August (late autumn and winter). Densities of larvae of estuarine-spawning species were much higher than those of marine spawners and peaked in spring, summer and autumn. Densities of larvae of species spawning in the sea were greatest during autumn. A significant proportion of the larvae of marine species recruiting into the St Lucia Estuary is at the postflexion, developmental stage. It is concluded that the St Lucia Estuary fulfils an impol1ant role as a nursery ground for early life history stages of many of the fish utilizing the St Lucia estuarine system.",

A striking source of interannual variability in this upwelling ecosystem, El Niño, results in large population and community variations. During El Niño the seasonal upwelling ceases and warm, clear oceanic waters occur close inshore, setting a unique oceanographic scenario in which the performance of populations and communities can be studied. While most attention has been focused on the pelagic components of such systems, numerous changes occur in inshore, benthic populations. Likewise, little attention has been paid to the critical role of humans as predators or active users of inshore, benthic resources. Humans as components of the ecosystem can impose significant alterations on population and community structure. In this paper the fishery statistics of three economically important inshore, benthic resources (the gastropod Concholepas concholepas, the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris and the kelp Lessonia nigrescens) are analysed in relation to the strong 1982/83 El Niño event. In particular, trends are described for landings in the far northern regions of Chile, where the marked effect of El Niño was concurrent with high levels of exploitation of C. concholepas and L. nigrescens.",

Fishery observers accompanied 13 fishing trips and observed 108 sets (143 260 hooks) during the period 1998–2000. Despite most lines being set at night, seabird bycatch rates were high, with a mean of 1.6 birds killed per 1 000 hooks. Japanese vessels (1% effort observed) had a higher bycatch rate (2.6 birds per 1 000 hooks, range per trip 0.1–5.4) than South African vessels (0.8, range 0.0–4.3; 17% effort observed), possibly as a result of gear differences. Bird bycatch differed regionally in relation to the numbers of birds attending vessels. In international waters off the Northern Cape and southern Namibia, where there are few birds, only one bird was caught on 93 600 hooks (0.01 birds per 1 000 hooks). Shy Thalassarche cauta, black-browed T. melanophris and yellow-nosed T. chlororhynchos albatrosses, and white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis were killed most frequently. Based on 1998–1999 fishing effort, simple extrapolation suggests that 19 000–30 000 seabirds are killed annually in South Africa's EEZ, of which 70% are albatrosses. Confidence in these estimates is low, given the small proportion of effort observed, but it is clear that urgent steps are needed to reduce seabird bycatch within South African waters.",

Three species dominate, Euphausia lucens over the shelf region of the southern Benguela, Euphausia hanseni over the outer shelf off Namibia and Nyctiphanes capensis in the neritic and shelf regions of the northern Benguela. Various models of interactions between biological processes and physical features are considered to explain likely mechanisms whereby these species can remain spatially segregated. All three species breed throughout the year, produce multiple broods and large numbers of eggs per brood and have high turnover rates. These strategies enable them to maintain high production in terms of both somatic growth and reproductive output throughout the year. Biomass of euphausiids in the northern Benguela is about double that of the west coast of the southern Benguela, consistent with similar geographical differences in phytoplankton abundance. Adult euphausiids are opportunistic omnivores and the larval stages are primarily herbivorous. Alternative feeding patterns are reflected in differences in the vertical migratory behaviour of various ontogenetic stages and ambient food type. Factors causing a switch from herbivory to carnivory are considered. Grazing of euphausiids is considered to play a minor role in phytoplankton losses, but euphausiids could exert considerable predatory impact on mesozooplankton and therefore compete directly with pelagic fish. Combined predation by various fish species has an appreciable impact on euphausiid production.",

New observations from moorings off Quoin Point during summer 1986/87 permit a fuller description of the dynamics of circulation and stratification and the identification of three subregions. The inner shelf is dominated by wind-forcing, as in eastern boundary upwelling systems, whereas the outer shelf is dominated by oceanic forcing, as over western boundary shelves. The mid-shelf is characterized by strong stratification separating near-surface oceanic water from near-bottom upwelling Central Water. A lack of correlation between currents and temperatures in these three subregions of the western Agulhas Bank suggests that they function independently. This synthesis of the physical oceanography, which includes discussion of the hydrodynamic coupling of the western Agulhas Bank with shelf regions to the east and west, leads to a discussion of the importance of circulation and stratification to the anchovy-related ecology of the region. This centres on the availability of food and transport for spawning anchovy Engraulis capensis on the western Agulhas Bank.",

Biological and physical processes acting alone and in concert give rise to the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton distribution, making categorization by causative mechanisms both difficult and artificial. Nevertheless, all scales and types of patchiness in the southern Benguela are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic process of upwelling, both through redistribution of existing biological variability and through the creation of spatial variability in the richness and suitability of the physical and chemical environment. Physical influences override biotic interactions during upwelling whereas, with the onset of stratification, physical processes become less dynamic, allowing biological and chemical factors to become the major determinants of phytoplankton variability. These observations are spatially confirmed, with physical forcing dominant close to the source of upwelling and biological influences more important downstream of upwelling.",

Long-term measures, such as fleet limitation, seasonal closures and de facto closed areas and size limits, all appropriate in the early stages of a fishery when knowledge is limited, should be replaced by more-flexible alternatives as knowledge improves. Methods of stock assessment, stock-recruitment studies and further basic biological analyses are recognized as being crucial to improving management methods. An explanation embracing physical oceanographic features and plankton productivity in the vicinity of the spawning grounds is advanced for the mechanisms underlying hatchling survival. The possible contribution of trophic studies to squid management is recognized. Effective management of the chokka squid resource is concluded to be possible provided that the specific areas needing attention be addressed by means of goal-orientated research. Rational, but not necessarily optimal, management decisions can, however, be made even in the absence of stock-recruitment data, by the employment of common-sense measures which generally include some form of effort control.",

Juvenile fish live in tidal pools and in shallow subtidal waters, where they feed on a variety of small invertebrates and chlorophytes. Larger fish are more common in deeper water down to about 30 m, but they also feed inshore, consuming large invertebrate prey such as gastropods, pelecypods, solitary ascidians, crustaceans and amphineurans. They are rudimentary hermaphrodites, mature at approximately 350 mm fork length and have a restricted breeding season between August and January, during which period they spawn small pelagic eggs. Growth studies based on sectioned sagittal otoliths reveal musselcracker to be slow-growing and long-lived, that both sexes grow at a similar rate and that they can survive to at least 31 years of age. The species is likely to be highly susceptible to overexploitation even though the fish are not commercially exploited, and more stringent management measures are called for to ensure the survival of the species as a recreational angling resource.",

Densities off Transkei and Natal are greater than they are off the Eastern Cape, but this may only be an artifact of the narrowness of the continental shelf in the north.

These macrophyte beds are utilized predominantly by small teleosts, both species which breed in the estuary and juvenile marine fish. By far the most abundant of the 97 species of fish recorded in these beds were Atherina breviceps, Gilchristella aestuaria, Liza dumerilii, Liza richardsonii and Rhabdosargus holubi. Classification grouped the ichthyofaunas of the six warm-temperate estuaries in the South-Eastern and Southern Cape at a similarity level >50 per cent. Ordination produced a similar clustering and also demonstrated that the subtropical Richards Bay and warm-temperate Mngazana estuary, together with the cold-temperate Langebaan Lagoon, were outliers. Classification and ordination showed that, within an estuary, the ichthyofaunas of dense and sparse Zostera areas were more similar than either was with those of non-vegetated areas. The species richness (R) of fish within eelgrass habitats along the southern African coast tended to decrease from north-east to south-west, a trend attributable to an attenuation in the number of tropical/subtropical Indo-Pacific species. The numerically dominant fish families in eelgrass beds in South Africa showed a greater degree of overlap with those of south-eastern Australia than with those of either southern Japan or eastern North America.",

Growth rates vary greatly with location and tidal elevation, but as they grow, the mussels compete intensively for space, consequent mortality rates being proportional to growth rate. Because growth declines with tidal elevation and as terminal size is approached, losses attributable to competition tend to be greatest in lowshore and sublittoral regions and early in life. There are many predators of mussels, each differing in its feeding rate and technique. The quantities and size distributions of C. meridionalis taken by communities of natural predators at selected sites are estimated. Total predator consumption is compared with rates of loss as individual mussels increase in size and compete for space. Fast-growing populations with large terminal sizes can support dense predator communities with little deleterious effect. Slower-growing ones with a smaller adult size have lower rates of competition-induced mortality and remain vulnerable to predators for longer. They are thus more likely to be predator-controlled. Predators such as gastropods (Natica and Nucella species), which preferentially select small mussels and have low consumption rates, have far less impact than those, such as Octopus spp. and birds, with higher energy demands and capable of taking larger mussels subject to less mortality from other causes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The biology of the chokker squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudii on inshore grounds in the South-East Cape was studied by examination of trends in jig catches, length frequency analyses, length/weight relationships, analyses of maturity stages and SCUBA diving transects in a spawning area. Commercial catches probably reflected the influx of squid into shallow waters to spawn. Modal length at spawning was between 265 and 305 mm mantle length (ML) in males and between 175 and 195 mm ML in females. There was no modal progression to indicate growth, nearly all squid were mature, a percentage of males were spent, the level of feeding on the grounds was very low, and mantle walls were thinner than those of squid offshore. These factors all indicate that the squid population inshore had reached the end of its life cycle and was in the spawning phase. The sex ratio was biased towards males, an indication either of differential inshore migration or of greater longevity in males than in females. The frequency of occurrence of trawled egg capsules was highest in summer and all eggs were between 18 and 25 m deep. The preferred substratum for spawning appeared to be low-relief reef interspersed with coarse sand, and the stalks of egg capsules were always embedded in the sand to form individual clusters, as in most other loliginids. No evidence was found of post-spawning mortality in the areas examined.",

    "abstract": "Six species of skates were trawled commonly on the continental shelf off the Southern Cape during routine surveys of demersal fish between 1986 and 1990. Raja miraletus is a small skate found principally in shallow (<50 m) water that feeds mainly on small crustaceans, such as mysids and macrurans. The large Raja alba occurs over most of the continental shelf, is a piscivore throughout its life and preys heavily on flatfish, especially Cynoglossus zanzibarensis. R. cf. clavata is ubiquitous on the shelf but most abundant between 50 and 150 m deep. Feeding predominantly on crustaceans, this skate switches from carids, penaeids and mysids when small to brachyurans and small benthic fish when larger. R. pullopunctata is found over a similar depth range but attains a much larger size. It eats small mysids and macrurans when small, but brachyurans and fish become more important in the diet with increasing size of the predator. R. wallacei is most commonly taken at depths of 80–>200 m, feeds initially on small crustaceans, but switches to fish, including eels, as it grows. The small Cruriraja parcomaculata is found at the edge of the continental shelf and over the upper slope; it preys on small crustaceans, including mysids, isopods and macrurans. The distribution pattern of the skates and their prey suggest overlap in prey taken, the overlap being greatest in those species which feed on crustaceans. The large biomass of skates in the area suggests that they are an important component of the demersal faunal assemblage of the continental shelf there, and also that they may have a significant impact on the benthic fauna.",

Growth in bronze whalers appears to be slower than in any Carcharhinus spp. previously studied. Maximum size recorded during this study was 294 cm total length (TL) for a male and 288 cm TL for a female, and the maximum ages recorded were 30 and 25 years respectively. Age at sexual maturity has been calculated at 13–19 years for males and 19–20 years for females. Differential mortality rates appear to operate on juveniles (Lee's phenomenon). Arguments are presented that indicate two separate populations: one distributed from the Western Cape eastwards and the other from just south of Walvis Bay northwards.

The 1986 survey revealed the distribution of the three species to be almost continuous between Cape Town and East London, with about 13 per cent of the pilchard, 21 per cent of the round herring and 4 per cent of the anchovy biomass east of Cape Town occurring on the East Coast. Abundance and distribution of pelagic fish off the East Coast was similar in 1986 and 1987. All three species spawn off the East Coast. Few temperate pelagic fish were detected off the Natal coast during either the 1986 or 1987 surveys, but during June 1990, pelagic fish targets, thought to have been mainly temperate clupeoids, were encountered over most of the shelf from East London to some 70 nautical miles north-east of Port St Johns, and along the shelf-edge in the vicinity of Port Shepstone. During all three surveys, pelagic fish in the vicinity of Port St Johns had descended into the cool water underlying the Agulhas Current. It is proposed that the annual \"sardine run\" off Natal is a phenomenon arising from an expansion of pilchard habitat during the cooler conditions that prevail during winter. The expansion brings the fish east into Transkei waters at roughly the same time each year. Phenomena such as current reversals, upwelling of cool water onto the narrow shelf or even pursuit by predators then results in \"leakage\" of schools along the shelf between Port St Johns and Durban.",

    "abstract": "Alternative harvesting schemes for the South African anchovy resource are considered. For this preliminary study, strategies in which quotas are simply related to the pre-catch survey estimates of spawning biomass and recruitment are investigated, using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The schemes evaluated are the strategies of a constant catch, a constant proportion of the recruitment estimate, and a variant on constant escapement. The relationship between modal recruitment and spawning biomass is assumed known, and the values of parameters such as natural mortality and mass-at-age are initially taken to be exact. True recruitment is assumed log-normally distributed about its modal value. The annual survey estimates of recruitment and spawning biomass are generated with typical measurement errors included. The results show the cost (expressed as a loss of potential annual yield) of imperfect survey information, natural recruitment variability, and constraints on year-to-year catch variability. The analysis is extended to integrate the outcome of specific harvesting strategies over the current estimates of the probability distributions for the model parameters, assuming that these are not updated as harvesting is continued. The final results suggest that the mean annual yield of the South African anchovy resource could be increased by about 40 per cent through use of a more flexible harvesting strategy than is the current practice, without at the same time increasing the risk of collapse.",

In these systems many of the more numerous fish, birds and mammals are opportunistic feeders having catholic diets. As a result species often have overlapping diets, and when a particular food item is plentiful it may be consumed by a wide variety of organisms at higher trophic levels. Frequently the performances of predator populations have been related to the availability of forage species, but predators have not always been influenced similarly by gross changes in the systems. Predators with the most generalized feeding strategies appear best buffered against collapses of particular prey resources. Although seabirds are generally opportunistic feeders, limitations in their foraging range may make them more susceptible than most other predators to system perturbations. Opportunistic feeding by species at lower trophic levels suggests that they could be advantaged by an increased food supply, and it may not be unreasonable to interpret species replacements in catches as reflecting shifts in the dominance of species. Overall catches from the systems have usually been more stable than the catches of individual species, which have shown wide fluctuations. Shifts in the dominance of species in the catches have often been sustained over a number of years. Generalized feeding creates the possibility that more than one species may benefit from energy made available by the collapse of an abundant resource, and there is evidence that species more abundant in former years have in some instances been partially replaced by a number of organisms. The likelihood of a particular organism becoming the main replacing species will probably be influenced by the degree to which it is utilized during and after the collapse of the originally dominant resource.",

Over a period of 10 days, concentrations of salps increased by as much as 25-fold in the thermocline, which amounted to a daily increase of zooids of 50 per cent. Doliolids increased five-fold during the same period. Both increases resulted from asexual reproduction and indicate that Thaliacea, through asexual reproduction, can respond almost instantaneously to favourable food conditions.

The drogue moved over distances of 67 – 200 km within 4–7 days at mean speeds of 18–39 cm·s−1. Drogue movement was variable and generally in the direction of the prevailing wind. However, significant \"up wind\" movement occurred when the drogue was entrained in counter-currents. Variations in hydrographic parameters at the start of each sequence, and in the bottom mixed layer along the drogue tracks, indicate that upwelling source waters are not always uniform. However, nutrient concentrations in source water were high (mean concentrations for nitrate, silicate and phosphate were 20,8, 16,6 and 1,88 mmoln·m−3 respectively), whereas oxygen (4,0 dm3·m−3) and chlorophylls a (0,6 mg·m−3) concentrations were low. Once conditions stabilized, phytoplankton blooms developed rapidly in the upper layers, the cycle of bloom development and decline being completed in about 6–8 days. Nutrients decreased rapidly (and oxygen and chlorophyll a increased) with nitrates sometimes reaching concentrations of < 1 mmol·m−3, and oxygen and chlorophyll a peaking at concentrations of up to 9,8 dm3·m−3 and 21,2 mg·−3 respectively. Only once did light-limitation (due to deep mixing) influence bloom development. In this case, only moderately high chlorophyll a concentrations (∼ 10 mg·m−3) were attained. Bloom decline was usually associated with low nutrient concentrations and can be attributed mainly to sinking and dispersion of the phytoplankton, because zooplankton grazing appeared to have had an insignificant impact on the phytoplankton blooms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The highly active squid which inhabit the pelagic zones of continental seas are characterized by high energy requirements and have been termed invertebrate athletes. In this paper, the physiological and biochemical background of muscular performance in squid from different environments is reviewed and the physiological and environmental factors limiting performance levels are addressed. One important factor is the highly concentrated haemocyanin which, in ommastrephid squid, and by virtue of their extreme pH dependence, helps to load oxygen efficiently in the gills and unload it fully into the tissues. Squid regulate their extracellular pH more efficiently than intracellular pH, so protecting the haemocyanin from fatal pH changes. However, a large proportion of the oxygen requirement in the mantle muscle must still be provided by oxygen uptake through the skin. Anaerobic mechanisms become involved beyond critical swimming speeds once oxygen supply to mitochondria becomes limiting. Onset of anaerobiosis also characterizes the limits of long-term tolerance to progressive hypoxia at a critical P O2 and to high, above-critical temperatures. In general, anaerobic energy production reflects an inability to meet oxygen demand and indicates transition to a time-limited situation. The development of energy-saving locomotion strategies therefore shifts critical thresholds and extends tolerance periods in species exposed to environmental extremes, typically in coastal areas. There, negatively buoyant squid make greater use of the fin for economical swimming, which is also advantageous because of the complexity of the environment. In Lolliguncula brevis, the rate at which anaerobic resources are used above the critical swimming velocity is minimized by oscillating between periods of high and low pressure jets, thereby extending the period during which the animal can dive into hypoxic or warm water. However, only jet propulsion can economically attain the high velocities necessary in the open sea. Accordingly, the highest performance levels are seen in squid inhabiting the open sea, and they are only made possible by the uniform environmental parameters. Some squid may be able to operate at their functional and environmental limits, revealing a trade-off between oxygen availability, temperature, performance level and, possibly, body size.",

    "abstract": "In upwelling ecosystems, fish tend to avoid spawning in areas dominated by strong offshore transport and strong wind-mixing. Spawning grounds are usually located downstream of the main upwelling centres and spawning is mostly tuned to avoid the peak of the upwelling season. However, in areas such as Peru, Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire-Ghana, spawning and upwelling occur simultaneously. What are the mechanisms that allow such reproductive strategies to be successful? To attempt to answer this question, some environmental characteristics of the spawning ground of Sardinella aurita in the Senegalese upwelling system are investigated. S. aurita adults migrate from Mauritania to Senegal in early winter, following the southward extension of upwelling along the coast. Intense spawning in late spring is concentrated south of Cap Vert. There, the surface distribution of several environmental parameters is quite unusual for an upwelling area. Sea surface temperature is minimum over the shelf and increases towards and away from the coast. Chlorophyll distribution peaks nearshore. This unique surface structure is interpreted as the result of a \"double cell\" structure in the upwelling vertical circulation: a first cell located at the shelf break, the main upwelling cell that brings cold and nutrient-rich subsurface water to the surface, and a second cell located inshore of the shelf break. A nearshore convergence tends to trap and retain phytoplankton and other biological components. In an upwelling system with a double-cell circulation structure, the coastal cell represents a very favourable environment for fish to reproduce: eggs and larvae do not spread offshore, but are retained in the productive and relatively stable coastal waters. Clearly, therefore, upwelling is not always detrimental for larval survival. Rather, upwelling and retention can occur simultaneously and together provide a favourable reproductive habitat.",

    "abstract": "Size is the single most important biological attribute of organisms, and it is the interplay of body mass and some limiting surface which determines the maximum size organisms can reach. In animals, the limiting surface depends, among other things, on whether they are terrestrial or aquatic, so breathing in air or water. In squid, fish and other water breathers, the limiting surface is that controlling respiration, i.e. gill surface area. A theory constructed from this is then presented along with six of its major corollaries, which are shown to be corroborated by available evidence. The key implication of the theory so articulated is that comparative approaches, such as used to infer or check the values of vital statistics in fish, should also work in squid. Also, current, very low estimates of longevity in large squid should be revised upwards.",

Spawning appears to be localized on the Transkei and Eastern Cape coasts during a short period in late winter. Small juveniles (<50 mm) enter estuarine nursery grounds along the Cape coast between September and November, remaining there for at least their first year of life before re-entering the marine environment. The post-estuarine juveniles (>150 mm) are semi-resident in the surf zone of sandy and mixed shores for about five years until maturing at a length of 650 mm, when they commence annual migrations. During autumn and early winter these mature fish migrate eastwards to near the north-eastern limit of their distributional range, to spawn during late winter. The return migration takes place during spring and large numbers of mature fish arrive in the South-Western Cape during summer. The high degree of estuarine dependence, the confinement of juveniles and subadults to the surf-zone, the large size at maturation and the predictable aggregations of mature individuals in particular areas are considered to render L. lithognathus particularly vulnerable to estuarine degradation and exploitation by fishermen.",

Shore-angling catches were analysed from (i) data gathered from roving creel surveys conducted in the open access areas from Kei Mouth to Stil Bay between April 1994 and February 1996, and (ii) monthly research fishing conducted in the TNP between February 1995 and January 1997. Results from a tag and release study conducted within a small area (c. 5 km) of the TNP revealed that the four study species were resident. Size frequency analyses revealed that the mean individual length (and mass) of the four species was significantly higher in the TNP than in the open access areas. Catch per unit effort data suggest that the species were between five and 21 times more abundant in the TNP. Analysis of anglers' daily catches revealed that the current bag limits (five per person per day) were seldom reached or exceeded even within the TNP, indicating the ineffective nature of this restriction. This study confirms the value of marine protected areas as an effective tool for the management of these and possibly other resident reef-associated fish that are vulnerable to overexploitation.

    "abstract": "Cape hake in Namibian waters are demersal and mesopelagic spawners, spawning peaking offshore between 100 and 400 m deep, depending on local environmental conditions. The cross-shelf circulation, low-oxygen layers and mesoscale gyres are three important environmental factors influencing hake spawning behaviour and subsequent transport of the spawning products. Normally, hake spawn offshore near the bottom at depths of 150–400 m. However, during one cruise, spawning was concentrated below several subsurface mesoscale gyres, resulting in reduced dispersion of the eggs and larvae. When the low-oxygen layer above the bottom is pronounced, hake spawning has been observed close to the top of the layer at oxygen concentrations as low as 0.2–0.3 mℓ ℓ−1. The relatively small size of the eggs and their high specific gravity make them ascend quite slowly from the spawning depths, 10–40 m per day. Consequently, hake eggs spawned deeper than 200 m hatch before they reach the upper mixed layer. The newly hatched larvae are relatively undeveloped, without functional eyes or mouth, and display little swimming activity during their first hours, but laboratory observations have revealed subsequent periods of downward swimming activity. Based on current field observations, on buoyancy measurements of eggs and larvae and on observed larval behaviour, it is concluded that hake eggs and larvae are transported onshore by features of the upwelling subsurface circulation that compensate for offshore movement of surface water. This may be the basic mechanism concentrating early juvenile hake nearshore. Spawning activity near the low-oxygen layer might be a behavioural adaptation to minimize egg predation, because few other species are expected to survive such low concentrations of oxygen.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A dataset is presented on the diversity of South African seaweed species and their distribution in contiguous 50-km coastal sections, to demonstrate current knowledge of the flora in various coastal regions. The coastline has a rich flora, consisting of some 800 species. The South Coast has the highest species diversity (between 250 and 300 species in each section) relative to the West Coast (about 140 species per section) or the East Coast (about 200 species per section). There is a considerable increase in the number of species (>240 species per section), particularly in the green algae, in the easternmost regions that border the tropics. An analysis of seaweeds present in six small stretches of coastline shows that these sites contain 80–90% of the species in the West and South coastal sections, but only 60% of species over the entire coastline. Therefore, successful conservation of relatively few sites could theoretically preserve the majority of the seaweed flora. Many of the species missing from these detailed collections are subtidal, a habitat that is generally undersampled, particularly on the South and East coasts. Although species diversity is becoming relatively well known, systematic studies on many groups, using modern techniques, are needed. Detailed core distribution data for many species are lacking, and there is no national plan for seaweed systematics or herbarium collections. The distributions of green algae are particularly poorly known. Detailed systematic and biogeographic investigations on the overlap between the seaweeds of the temperate South Coast and those of the tropical Indian Ocean are necessary, and these should include subtidal collections and vegetation descriptions.

An approach is outlined which can be used to account qualitatively for the consequences of a stock-recruitment relationship. The model is used to make predictions for the stocks of slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus off South-East Africa. Model predictions of sex ratios compare favourably with field observations. Predictions of yield-per-recruit models that ignore any relationship between spawner stock size and recruitment can be misleading. Three scenarios concerning recruitment to the Natal stock of slinger can be postulated from the present robust nature of the stock to a high level of fishing mortality. Either recruitment is not dependent only on the number of males in the stock, or there is sufficient migration of 0-year-olds from nearby regions into the Natal stock, or recruitment is related to spawner stock size by the Ricker relationship. If lack of males is a limiting factor for recruitment, intensive exploitation of the virtually pristine stocks in the St Lucia Marine Reserve and off southern Moçambique could collapse the Natal stock and even the entire resource.",

    "abstract": "St Lucia is one of the largest estuarine systems in Africa, and attracts thousands of anglers each year. Catchcard data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986–1999 were analysed to determine catch composition, catch per unit effort (cpue) and seasonality of catches by recreational anglers. Because not all anglers completed catch cards, estimates of total catch were made using additional data on the number of private boat outings, the number of boat trailers at boat slipways and the number of boats recorded entering the campsite gates during 1992 and 1993. In all, 27 fish families, constituting 55 species, were recorded by recreational anglers. Dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii, perch Acanthopagrus berda, Natal stumpnose Rhabdosargus sarba, springer Elops machnata and mini-kob Johnius dorsalis were the most prominent species caught in terms of numbers and mass. Catch rates expressed numerically (fish angler−1 h−1) peaked during the summer and early winter. However, in terms of mass, catch rates peaked during late winter and spring, when there were increased landings of large dusky kob. Fluctuations in cpue were linked to salinity and estuary mouth conditions (i.e. mouth closure). Despite annual fluctuations in cpue, regression analysis revealed an overall downward trend for the dominant species (dusky kob and spotted grunter) and a gradual increase for stumpnose, perch and springer, but with the exception of stumpnose, these trends were not significant. Socio-economic aspects of the fishery were also investigated by conducting an independent boat-angler survey. The value of the recreational fishery, in terms of accommodation and direct angler expenditure, was estimated to be in the region of R9 million during 1992. Angler attitudes towards fishing regulations were positive and anglers generally had a good knowledge of the regulations for target species. Based on this assessment, a number of suggestions are made regarding the future management of the recreational fishery at St Lucia.",

C. nasutus is a benthic carnivore, feeding on a wide variety of prey, particularly molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. Preliminary observations suggest that they are protogynous hermaphrodites, females changing sex at approximately 700 mm fork length. Growth studies based on age determination from otoliths showed that they grow slowly and are long-lived, the oldest aged fish being 45,5 years. These facts suggest that they are susceptible to over-exploitation, and more stringent conservation measures are recommended to ensure survival of the species as a recreational resource.",

    "abstract": "A link is proposed between the processes that led to the evolution of large species of squid and the highly variable, cyclic recruitment seen in squid fisheries. Maximum growth requires maximal feeding and minimal routine metabolism at optimum temperatures, which decrease as squid grow. Topographically induced upwelling zones, inshore of western boundary currents, provide productive environments with appropriate temperatures for all life stages. Most squid are small and live in the tropics or subtropics; locomotor constraints prevent them from swimming long distances. Long annual migrations to spawn upstream in current systems require short-lived squids to maximize rates of growth. Therefore, such systems provide the opportunity and a powerful selective advantage for large size and rapid growth. Increased fecundity and cannibalism provide additional directional selection for large individuals. Current systems show food production peaks (blooms); paralarval release must match these to increase survival. Because squid are semelparous, disruption of delicately balanced lifecycles by physical events can virtually annihilate stocks. Recovery probably requires that populations of large squid \"re-evolve\" from smaller, more-stable tropical populations of small squid. This recovery phase may extend the \"down-side\" of abundance cycles. Studies of squid/current systems have focused on western boundary currents, but the Illex complex also associates with eastern boundaries. Such populations are generally smaller than in larger systems, supporting the hypothesis, but more detailed comparisons are required.",

These differences are most likely exaggerated by the formation of resting spores. Although the water column was dominated by vegetative cells, the flux to the sediment occurred largely in the form of resting spores. The results suggest rapid formation and settling of resting spores from the water column. These transient events may be missed by typical field sampling procedures, thereby underestimating frequency of spore formation. High concentrations of resting spores dominated the phytoplankton assemblages of the sediment/water interface, suggesting that seeding by spores from the sediment is possibly an important factor resulting in the success of Chaetoceros species and the consistently high phytoplankton standing crops in this region.",

It is surmised that wind-forcing plays a major role in water circulation in the Bay and over the inshore continental shelf remote from the influence of the open ocean. The predominantly barotropic current flow, of the order of 0,5 m·s−1, was downwind and influenced by topographic features and coastline shape. The Agulhas Current influences the ocean structures by long-term (large episodic meanders) and short-term (upwelling forced by the Current, core upwelling in frontal eddies and warm frontal plumes at the surface) fluctuations. Temperature structures showed well mixed water in Algoa Bay and a strong thermocline over the continental shelf, and were typical of a western boundary current in the Agulhas Current itself. The presence of a thermocline at 30–50 m over the shelf prevented upward mixing of nutrients. The Current exerted a dominant effect on shelf waters north of Algoa Bay.",

The aragonite is arranged in prismatic structures radiating from the centre to the margin of the otolith. Each prism contains aggregates of crystalline fibres, which are in turn made up of numerous microcrystals. The constituents of the otoliths are laid down in a regular manner associated with growth, typical of all teleosts, each increment being composed of a continuous and discontinuous unit. The discontinuous unit is relatively less calcified. The width of the increment depends upon when it was formed. The chemical composition of the protein (otolin) seems to change with age. The acidic and the hydrophobic amino acids increase, the basic amino acids decrease and the polar amino acids and glycine remain stable. This increase in the rate of deposition of the acidic amino acids is probably related to the enhanced mineralization in the otoliths of older fish.",

    "abstract": "The boat-based linefishery is the most important marine fishery along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal, producing 40% of the total annual mass of fish landed there. Since 1900, the fishery has supported commercial and recreational sectors that compete for more than 120 species, using similar methods in the same fishing areas. Catch-and-effort data have been collected sporadically from the commercial linefishery since 1910 and the recreational linefishery since 1970. The number of commercial vessels increased from 10 in 1910 to 140 in 1995, and effective commercial effort continues to increase, despite a limit placed on the number of vessels in 1985. Recreational participation escalated from 20 skiboats in 1948 to 2 000 in 1995 and entry to this sector remains unlimited. Introduction of the beach-launched, trailable skiboat in 1945 resulted in a rapid expansion of effort to coastal areas that previously functioned as harvest refugia for resident reef fish. Total catch has declined, despite increased effort, as has catch per unit effort (cpue) There have also been substantial changes in catch composition and catches have been sustained by sequential target switching from large endemic reef fish such as seventyfour Polysteganus undulosus, red steenbras Petrus rupestris and rockcods Epinephelus spp., to smaller sparids. such as slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus, santer Cheimerius nufar and blueskin Polysteganus coeruleopunctatus, and shoaling migrants, such as king mackerel Scomberomorus commerson, geelbek Atractoscion aequidens and kobs Argyrosomus spp. The linefish resources off KwaZulu-Natal have long been incapable of sustaining the fishing effort in the region and most resident species are now overexploited. Existing linefish management measures have not been successful in limiting fishing mortality to sustainable levels and existing limits on commercial permits and recreational launches will have to be substantially reduced if this is to be achieved. Bag limits may also have to be substantially reduced, particularly for endemic reef fish, to rebuild stocks to sustainable levels. Given the difficulty of implementing such controls, the maintenance of a number of large, suitably sited marine reserves appears to offer one of the few practicable chances of conserving the endemic reef fish stocks of KwaZulu-Natal.",

Loligo spp. were present throughout coastal waters of the United Kingdom, but distribution was patchy and highly variable over space and time. The relationship between squid distribution and sea temperature and salinity in the North Sea was examined by overlaying maps of squid abundance (landings per unit effort lpue) and oceanographic variables, and using correlation and multiple regression analysis. Bottom temperature was most frequently correlated with lpue, with correlations between squid and oceanographic parameters occurring most often in January and February of a given year. Monthly changes in distribution patterns are consistent with squid undertaking seasonal migrations around the coast of the U.K. It is at present unknown whether temperature and salinity influence squid distribution directly (e.g. reflecting physiological tolerance limits), through effects on recruitment, growth or mortality, or indirectly as a result of passive movement of squid into the North Sea during inflow of warmer Atlantic water.",

Results demonstrate that the baroclinic coastal upwelling jet (and associated front), which was over the shelf poleward of Cape Blanco in all three cruises, separates from the continental shelf, providing an important mechanism for transporting material across the continental margin to the deep ocean. This flow-topography interaction mechanism is a universal phenomenon, and is likely to be important in other eastern boundary current regions of the world. The observations from the two August cruises show two different phenomena. In 1994, cyclogenesis was observed, during which the coastal jet was connected with a cyclonic eddy offshore before the connection was severed and the jet again flowed continuously around Cape Blanco but shifted eastwards. In 1995, the coastal jet meandered in the vicinity of Cape Blanco and then continued equatorward as an oceanic jet in deep water, but it was stronger and displaced farther seawards than the previous year. Drifters released early in the upwelling season (May 1995), when the strengthening longshore upwelling jet was only minimally perturbed by the Cape, were transported rapidly equatorwards and were swept through a large portion of the eastern boundary current region. Drifters released later in the upwelling season (August) were initially swept offshore and equatorwards near the Cape, but after interaction with the spatially complex mesoscale circulation, eventually returned to the continental margin with the seasonal reversal in winds and near-surface currents. These differing flow trajectories are likely to have a significant impact on the biology of eastern boundary currents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhytoplankton models generally do not consider the initial phases of seed stocks and deal only with the vegetative growth phase, ignoring life history strategies. Some quantitatively important diatoms, such as species of Chaetoceros and Skeletonema, have special strategies with respect to the timing of the planktonic phase that cannot be explained purely on the basis of environmental clues. In Norwegian waters and elsewhere, the first Chaetoceros bloom of the growth season usually starts in mid March, initiated by C. socialis. Other Chaetoceros species appear in the water column later. Species of dinoflagcllates like Alexandrium also bloom at certain times of the year. In many cases, phytoplankton inocula originate from resuspension of bottom-dwelling spores or cysts rather than from residual planktonic vegetative cells, and it is probable that, in some species, inoculation events are controlled by endogenous biological clocks. The sequential appearance of different Chaetoceros species may be related to day-length-regulated germination of spores. Most Chaetoceros species have few generations, but they appear at opportunistic times in the plankton. In contrast, Skelelonema costatum and Scrippsiella trochoidea appear at any time of the year. Some modelling results can be improved by including the dynamics of phytoplankton seed stocks in the sediments.",

In all, 3 387 lower beaks were found in the stomach contents. A total of 15 families was identified from 117 tiger sharks with cephalopod lower beaks in their stomachs. Sepiidae, Octopodidae and Ancistrocheiridae were most numerous and dominated in terms of mass.

The cephalopod prey items of 258 smooth hammerheads were dominated by Loliginidae. Sepiidae and Ancistrocheiridae were also major components of the 12 families identified. The prey items of seven great hammerheads were dominated by Ancistrocheiridae and Octopoteuthidae, and only six families were recorded. Neritic cephalopods were relatively more important in smaller sharks of each species analysed, whereas pelagic and epibenthic taxa from offshore were more dominant in larger individuals, these findings thus supporting information on shark behaviour derived from previous feeding and telemetry studies. There was overlap in cephalopod taxa taken by these sharks and by marine mammals in the same area, and the high numbers of some of the cephalopods in stomach contents, such as Sepiidae, Octopodidae, Ancistrocheiridae and Octopoteuthidae, suggest that they may be very abundant in the study area.",

    "abstract": "The study synthesises current understanding of the predominant physical processes responsible for the seasonality of harmful algal blooms, notably Alexandrium catenella and Dinophysis spp., in the nearshore environment of Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa. Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa. Mussel farming started there in 1985 and the present level of production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the continental shelf to the north between 32°S and St Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate build-up of intense blooms during late summer. Offshore dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation. Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is established. Evidence suggests that the near surface component of the flow occurs as a sudden \"flood\" event. These dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in turn advected into Saldanha Bay when upwelling relaxes, when the density gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow. Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in the bay relative to the shelf.",

The diets of male rock lobsters were compared between two different depths, different seasons, across the moult cycle, and among eight sites along the South-Western Cape coast. There was no significant difference in diet between male and female rock lobsters for any of the size-classes examined. Male rock lobsters showed large differences in diet between small and large size-classes. The diet of small lobsters (<75mm CL) consisted of a wide range of species, which included, in order of importance, coralline algae, barnacles Notomegabalanus algicola, sponges and ribbed mussels Aulacomya ater. However, prey items rich in inorganic material were not dominant in their diet, as had been predicted. By contrast, large rock lobsters (>80mm CL) fed on few species, and fish and ribbed mussels were their most abundant prey items. There were some dietary differences between individuals captured at 20 m and those collected at 50 m, but these differences were less marked than between the two sampling sites (the Knol and Olifantsbos). There was seasonal variation in diet at the Dassen Island and Olifantsbos sites. Cannibalism was highest during the moulting periods. Gut fullness varied seasonally at Dassen Island, and was consistently high at Olifantsbos. However, the proportion of the population feeding showed marked seasonal trends at both sites, tracking the commercial catch per unit effort of rock lobster. Ribbed mussels were a ubiquitous and dominant component of the diet at the eight sites sampled. However, south of Dassen Island, black mussels Choromytilus meridionalis were scarce in the diet of rock lobster and sponges predominated. Gut fullness was lowest at the northernmost sites.",

The model used in the analyses is age- and sex-structured, and assumes density-dependence in the survival rate of pups. Uncertainty is assessed by conducting sensitivity tests and estimating 90% confidence intervals by the percentile method. The results confirm the increase of the seal population since the introduction of legal controls at the end of the 19th century, and the estimate of 1,7 million animals of Age 1 and older at the start of 1993 is relatively robust to model assumptions and values for biological parameters. The food consumption by the seal population is estimated to have almost doubled between 1973 and 1993, and to be roughly 2 million tons annually at present. Future trajectories of seal numbers and annual consumption of food cannot be determined with great precision and are sensitive to the values assumed for the post-first-year survival rate and the degree of compensation in density-dependence. Depending on such assumptions, the seal population could already have reached its pre-exploitation equilibrium level or still be well below this level. Data from the 1993 aerial survey have considerable influence on the model results, and particularly on inferences concerning whether the population is now approaching its pre-exploitation level. This suggests that further surveys should be conducted to ascertain the reliability of the changed trend in pup abundance indicated by that 1993 count.",

The surveys, which were performed primarily during routine fisheries law enforcement patrols by a regional conservation agency, recorded the catch and effort of 2 468 individual angler outings (12 840 angling hours) during 337 angler-count patrols. Although 26 species were recorded, a large proportion of the catch (85%) comprised only four species. Spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii (43%) was most commonly caught, followed by Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi (16%), dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (14%) and white seacatfish Galeichthys feliceps (12%). In terms of mass, the overall catch was dominated by A. japonicus (50%) and P. commersonnii (33%). Overall catch per unit effort (cpue) by number was highest during summer and lowest during winter, and vice versa for cpue according to mass. Angler counts showed the Sundays Estuary had the highest mean angling effort for both weekdays and weekends (10.1 and 22.9 anglers count−1 respectively). The Gamtoos Estuary had the lowest count for weekdays (5.5 anglers count−1) and the Kariega Estuary the lowest for weekends (9.8 anglers count−1). Shore-based was more popular than boat-based angling (59% compared to 41%), and all estuaries had substantially higher angling effort on weekends than on weekdays. Angling with bait (93.3%) was more popular than lure- or fly-angling (6.7% combined). Considerations for management of A. japonicus in the Eastern Cape estuarine linefishery are presented.Keywords: CATCHESEASTERN CAPEEFFORTESTUARIESRECREATIONAL LINEFISHERY",

Data were collected by moored thermistors and during a ship's cruise, and wind measurements were made at Cape Recife and Bird Island. Results confirmed upwelling off the southern shoreline of Cape Recife during easterly or north-easterly winds. When the wind switched to westerly or south-westerly, upwelling relaxed and cold water that had broken the surface during upwelling was dispersed eastwards towards the point of Cape Recife. Within a few hours of the change in wind direction to westerly, cold water was observed along the Algoa Bay shoreline of Cape Recife. The influence of wind-forcing and Kelvin waves on upwelling and the emergence of cold water along the Bay-side shoreline of the cape are discussed.",

This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investigates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20–30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 × 20 m lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system. Keywords: ECKLONIA MAXIMAHARVESTINGFRONDSKELPREGROWTHSOUTH AFRICAUNDERSTOREY BIOTA",

    "abstract": "Many top predators in the Benguela ecosystem feed on prey species targeted by commercial fisheries. Their roles as indicators of the state of exploited prey resources, as competitors with commercial fisheries for resources, and as susceptible to impact from commercial fishing on those resources are briefly considered. Trends in the occurrence of anchovy Engraulis capensis and pilchard Sardinops ocellatus in the diet of Cape gannets Morus capensis off South Africa's west coast are related significantly to survey estimates of the abundance of these fish species, and they provide useful confirmation of those estimates. In the 1980s, anchovy decreased in the diet of Cape gannets, but pilchard increased. In both the northern and southern portions of the Benguela system, groundfish were thought to eat most (66–73%) of the total quantity of cephalopods and vertebrates consumed by predators and man in the 1980s. South African fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, predatory pelagic fish and man removed roughly equal amounts, with squids, seabirds and cetaceans having a smaller impact. In the 1980s, man and seals removed about two million tons live mass more than in 1930. Indices of the rate of natural mortality of anchovy and pilchard attributable to Cape gannets are not related to biomass of the prey species. That for anchovy was high in 1989 when a poor anchovy year-class was formed. Decreased abundance of anchovy led to poor breeding by Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis in 1989 and 1990. A model linking the Cape cormorant population with anchovy is used to explore the impact of possible exploitation strategies for anchovy on Cape cormorants.",

Some bins had consistently higher densities of whales than others, cither of cows with calves or of unaccompanied adults. Apart from an overall increase in density, the centre of distribution shifted 40–60 minutes of longitude to the west over the 30-year period. Most (>93.4%) female calves born on the South African coast returned there to have their first calf, but only 52.9% were photographed with their first calf in the same or an adjacent bin as that of their natal year. This compares with 60.9% of multigravid females that occurred in the same or an adjacent bin as that of their previous calf, with significantly more west-ward (368) than eastward (255) shifts in distribution between calves. Approximate residence times for cow-calf pairs in the De Hoop region were 12–105 (average = 59.0 ± 3.9) days: dispersal rates were low between July and September but increased thereafter. Incidental records of coastwise movement were mainly to the west, but were probably influenced by the survey direction. Distances moved ranged from 6 to 202 km. at average speeds of 0.08–2.89 km·h−1. Theodolite tracking of undisturbed groups of right whales from Cape Columbine produced a similar range of swimming speeds. Inter-calf movements of cows between the survey area and the coasts to both east and west indicated that the entire South African coast could be considered as one homogeneous winter assemblage area for right whales.",

Sardine CF showed a seasonal cycle in the southern but not in the northern Benguela. Time-series of GSI showed high interannual variability but no trends in either subsystem, and the seasonal pattern was similar for both stocks. The lack of coherence between the CF time-series for sardine in the two subsystems further suggests that sardine stocks in the northern and southern Benguela subsystems are independent.",

The composition of the zooplankton between 17 and 27°S was similar each year. Among the 20°30 most abundant species, 3°4 copepods dominated, influencing the distribution of total zooplankton biomass. During quiescent upwelling, zooplankton abundance was low and there were no significant differences in the inshore-offshore distribution of zooplankton biomass, the maximum occurring over the slope. During active upwelling, zooplankton biomass increased significantly, the maximum over the shelf being constituted almost entirely of developmental stages of herbivorous copepods. Over the inner shelf, all stages of the copepod Calanoides carinatus were feeding actively, removing up to 5 per cent per day of the standing stock of phytoplankton. Comparison of daily ration, respiration rate and biochemical composition of C. carinatus revealed active storage of energy inshore. Offshore populations of C. carinatus, found deeper than 200 m, comprised mainly copepodite stage V, which were not feeding and were characterized by decreased mobility and respiration and a high lipid content. It is estimated that the energy stored during active upwelling enables copepods to survive up to six months without any additional source of energy.",

One of these communities, at Marcus Island, has prolific beds of the black mussel Choromytilus meridionalis (35 954 g wet weight·m−2) accompanied by a large number of other species, notably sea urchins, holothurians, brittle stars, whelks and barnacles. In contrast, the other site, Malgas Island, is dominated by a large population of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii together with a dense seaweed flora (3 866 and 4 402 g wet weight·m−2 respectively). The numbers of species are similar at both sites (102 at Malgas Island and 107 at Marcus Island) but only 34 per cent are common to both localities. Although preliminary research indicates that the two sites have fairly similar physical conditions and bottom topography, they maintained their contrasting communities for the whole research period (1983–1986) and have probably done so for at least nine years, suggesting that they represent two stable alternative states of the same ecosystem. In the absence of rock lobsters at Marcus Island, wave action and inter/intraspecific competition are the main forces structuring the benthic community. Stability is maintained here by the resilience and rapid recovery of the mussel population after disturbance by storms. Where rock lobsters are abundant, as at Malgas Island, intense predation pressure is the main force controlling the structure of the benthos, and it is continually maintained because the rock lobsters are resistant to the effect of storms. Therefore, the presence or absence of high densities of rock lobsters is fundamental to the maintenance of these two contrasting communities.",

There were no significant differences in allele-frequency among areas for nine polymorphic loci. A gene-diversity analysis showed that most of the genetic variation was contained within areas (99,62%), and that only a fraction of the total (0,38%) could be attributable to geographic differences among locations. Combining the data shows that the slight morphological differentiation among areas does not have a genetic basis.

Rates of copepod production were similar in both water types, 4,1 and 3,6 mg C·m−3·day−1. Food-chain efficiency (FCE), the ratio of secondary to primary production, ranged from 3,5 to 12,5 per cent. Copepods consumed 12–42 per cent of the primary production. The FCE and the absolute proportion of phytoplankton consumed were dependent upon which sizes of phytoplankton were assumed eaten by the grazers.",

    "abstract": "Discussion of mesopelagic fish within the southern Benguela system necessitates recognition of both oceanic and neritic realms, demarcated by the continental shelf-break. In the eastern South Atlantic (FAO Area 47), the stock size of two oceanic, mesopelagic families (Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae) have been estimated at 8–12 million and 750 000 metric tons respectively. Each possesses pseudoceanic species, populations of which constitute a possible alternative fishery resource to conventional pelagic stocks. Of these upper-slope/shelf derivatives, Lampanytodes hectoris (Myctophidae) and Maurolicus muelleri (Sternoptychidae) are most abundant. In the southern Benguela system (Orange River mouth to Cape Point), both species appear to be restricted mainly to the region east of the offshore divergence, corresponding roughly to the continental shelf-break. Maurolicus muelleri has not been taken by the fishery, but purse-seine landings of Lampanyctodes hectoris have accounted for up to some 10 per cent of the total South African pelagic catch. Anomalies in the commercial catch (sexual disparity, sexual immaturity) have been linked to expatriatism. This phenomenon is re-examined in the light of more recent data from research sampling in the southern Benguela region, and alternative biological hypotheses are presented to explain the anomalies. It is suggested that the energy \"bonus\" derived from vertical migration in summer is enhanced both by a physical component, termed \"cycle riding\", and by a biochemical component, linked to long-chain wax esters. Seasonal variation in percentage lipid concentration also appears to be associated with reproductive activity in the late winter-spring spawning period. Vertical migration may be reduced at this time, in tandem with the cessation of upwelling within the system and paucity of food in the upper water column. Comparative data for Maurolicus muelleri are presented.",

The meso- and macrozooplankton communities consist chiefly of copepods and euphausiids respectively. Although geographic and seasonal differences in standing stock are reasonably well described for the inner shelf (<200 m), knowledge of production and rate processes affecting standing stock is limited, and extrapolation to the whole shelf area (<500 m) provides only a crude appraisal of the real situation. Despite the uncertainties, direct measurements have improved on estimates previously inferred. It seems likely that grazing by meso- and macrozooplankton plays a minor role in phytoplankton losses in the Benguela system. However, it would appear that predation by macrozooplankton, particularly under swarming conditions, has an appreciable impact on mesozooplankton biomass.",

During the 1985 cruise, active upwelling was apparent in all sections, but during 1986, upwelling was moderate. On both surveys, lowest inshore temperatures were found around 26°S. In spring 1985, chlorophyll-rich tongues were recorded off Lüderitz and Meob Bay and north of Walvis Bay, between 23 and 20°30′S. Concentrations of chlorophyll a were, in general, fairly homogeneous throughout a layer of 40–60 m depth, and correlation between surface chlorophyll a and integrated values for the water column was good. In April 1986, concentrations of chlorophyll a of 40 mg·m−3 were found off Walvis Bay; from there, bands of surface chlorophyll a concentrations exceeding 10 mg·m−3 extended towards the north and south-west. The vertical sections in April 1986 showed a certain degree of stratification, and in the northern one (at 17°30′S) there was a marked subsurface chlorophyll maximum offshore. Photosynthetically active irradiance and primary productivity (14C method) were measured at selected stations. The depth of the 1-per-cent light level ranged from 11 to 40 min 1985 and from 12 to 57 min 1986. Integrated primary production estimates at midday ranged from 0,04 to 0,10 g C·m−2·h−1 (down to the 3-per-cent light level) in spring 1985 and from 0,05 to 0,34 g C·m−2·h−1 (down to the 1,5-per-cent light level) in autumn 1986. The productivity indices (mg C·mg chlorophyll a−1·h−1) for comparable concentrations of chlorophyll a and the slope of the regression lines of integrated primary productivity on integrated or surface chlorophyll a were higher in autumn 1986 than in spring 1985.",

The model serves to close the temporal gap between models of the system for the 1970s and 1990s. The aim is to provide a workable model, with the intention of encouraging scientists working on different components of the ecosystem to collaborate to improve and update the model for more recent years. Ultimately, this type of model may form a basis for multispecies management approaches in the region. By the 1980s, sardine Sardinops sagax and hake Merluccius spp. stocks in the northern Benguela had both undergone a decline, yet were still heavily fished. Horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis had increased over the previous decade and was the dominant pelagic species during the 1980s, with high catches. Production by some groups, such as goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, mesopelagic fish and demersal fish, was insufficient to sustain other components of the system. In all, 1.5 million tons of goby, 1.7 million tons of mesopelagic fish and 0.7 million tons of demersal fish (excluding hake) were required to support predators in the northern Benguela. Total biomass in the northern Benguela during the 1980s was high, comparable to that of the Peruvian system in the I960s and almost double that of the northern Benguela during the 1970s. Horse mackerel and hake catches were both high, with fishing on hake being ecologically more expensive. Biomass of benthic producers, meio- and macrobenthos were a quarter of the total biomass of these groups in the southern Benguela. The sensitivity of the model to parameter estimates is highlighted. Uncertainty about some of the parameters, thought to have major influences on the functioning of the model, is explored.",

Results indicated that the spearfishery is the smallest sector of the linefishery, with an estimated 7 000 participants and an annual compounded growth rate of 6.14%. Regional comparisons of catch composition and catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) were made, although spearfishing data stored on the NMLS were biased in favour of KwaZulu-Natal. Analysis of the data from KwaZulu-Natal showed little evidence of a decline in cpue or significant changes in species composition between 1984 and 1995. However, considerable overlap was noted between catches of spearfishermen and those made by other sectors of the linefishery. Of the 950 postal questionnaires sent to KwaZulu-Natal licence-holders, 152 (16%) were returned. A further 38 personal interviews and 74 creel inspections were completed during shore patrols and boat inspections in the Eastern and Western Cape. Spearfishermen interviewed generally showed a positive response to the current linefish management measures and, other than for minimum size limits, compliance with the regulations was good. A number of suggestions for improving management of the spearfishery are discussed.",

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-Western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrata, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong, positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98% were found beneath sea urchins. All small (3–10 mm) and medium-sized(11–20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (∼10%) of larger juveniles(21–35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone, because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins. The long-term consequences for the industry may be crucial.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Information on the vertical chlorophyll structure in the ocean is important for estimating integrated chlorophyll a and primary production from satellite. For this study, vertical chlorophyll profiles from the Benguela upwelling system and the Angola-Benguela front were collected in winter to identify characteristic profiles. A shifted Gaussian model was fitted to each profile to estimate four parameters that defined the shape of the curve: the background chlorophyll concentration (B 0), the height parameter of the peak (h), the width of the peak (σ) and the depth of the chlorophyll peak (zm ). A type of artificial neural network called a self-organizing map (SOM) was then used on these four parameters to identify characteristic profiles. The analysis identified a continuum of chlorophyll patterns, from those with large surface peaks (>10 mg m−3) to those with smaller near-surface peaks (<2 mg m−3). The frequency of occurrence of each chlorophyll pattern identified by the SOM showed that the most frequent pattern (∼12%) had a near-surface peak and the least frequent pattern (∼2%) had a large surface peak. These characteristic profile shapes were then related to pertinent environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, mixed layer depth and euphotic depth. Partitioning the SOM output map into environmental categories showed large peaks of surface chlorophyll dominating in water with cool temperature, high surface chlorophyll concentration and shallow mixed layer and euphotic depth. By contrast, smaller peaks of subsurface chlorophyll were in water with warmer temperature, lower surface chlorophyll concentration, intermediate mixed layer and deep euphotic depth. These relationships can be used semi-quantitatively to predict profile shape under different environmental conditions. The SOM analysis highlighted the large variability in shape of vertical chlorophyll profiles in the Benguela. This suggests that an ideal typical chlorophyll profile, as used in the framework of biogeochemical provinces, may not be applicable to this dynamic upwelling system.

A general perspective is that the roles of space and time are reversed in the two groups, suggesting that management strategies also should differ. The space/time reversal appears to be more marked in the wide-ranging commercial ommastrephids than in the loliginids, which are more localized and have less extreme strategies. Fish have large energy reserves and efficient lifestyles, allowing stocks to produce numerous co-existing year-classes; as larvae surviving a wide range of potentially limiting conditions in different years, they store genetic diversity and stabilize recruitment in time. Squid are primarily annual species, so stocks can only achieve such diversity and stabilization by spawning microcohorts throughout the year to disperse widely in space into equally variable microhabitats. This behaviour would link recruitment more tightly to environmental variability. The population dynamics and the tactics used appear quite complex, possibly including kinship, school cohesion and cannibalism.",

The filled generalized Von Bertalanffy growth equations were: L t = 1 473[1−e−0.22R(t+2.620)]2.468 for females, L t = 1 372[1−e−0.26M(t+2.620)]4.619 for males. Growth was faster in females, but in both sexes it slowed down after the age of 8. The relationships between otolith dimensions (length, height, mass and ostium to cauda distance) and fish length, in each of three regions, suggested that South African A. japonicus exist as three or more stocks.",

With data from the northern and southern Benguela, a negatively correlated regression was established between sea surface temperature (SST) and NO3-N integrated over the depth zone of the biologically productive surface layer. This permitted quantification of the NO3-N available for production for a specific upwelling event from a NOAA satellite image of SST covering the whole Benguela. The regressed value was considered equivalent to the potential new production of that particular upwelling event and was expressed in carbon terms via the Redfield ratio. This figure was extrapolated to an annual figure by the identification of the number of upwelling events in that year from daily METEOSAT images and supported by synoptic weather maps. The result (4,7 × 1013 gC·y−1) compared well intra- and inter-regionally and globally. Assumptions implicit in the estimation method and ways of improving the data set upon which the regressions were based are discussed. Any refinements resulting from this would fine tune the result but are thought unlikely to alter the order of magnitude estimation.",

Differences in the species composition of catches, catch rates and seasonality at the two sampling sites are attributed to differences in the seasonal distribution of sampling effort and exploitation histories. Despite the fact that comparisons with other angling catch data from around southern Africa are complicated by a number of factors, a clear relationship between catch per unit effort and degree of exploitation is evident, suggesting that abundance of angling fish is particularly sensitive to exploitation and that marine reserves are a viable management option.",

Standing stocks were quantified and population parameters (growth, mortality and recruitment) determined for both species. These data were used to derive empirical estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for P. granatina and P. argenvillei (7,4 and 1,5 tons wet foot mass respectively). The population parameters were also used in the development of a length-based simulation model to provide a second estimate of MSY for P. granatina (up to 12,9 tons). Small-scale experimental harvesting showed that both species recovered extremely slowly if all limpets were removed (total clearance). When the harvest was size-selective (partial clearance), with P. granatina >60 mm and P. argenvillei >75 mm being removed, P. granatina failed to recover after 13 months but P. argenvillei recovered within 15 months. Partial and total clearance led to enhanced growth and survival of the remaining limpets. Partial clearance of P. granatina had no effect on other species in the community, but partial and total removal of P. argenvillei resulted in increased cover of sessile filter-feeders and macroalgae as well as a decrease in the cover of encrusting coralline algae. It is concluded that the potential exists for the development of an economically viable and ecologically sustainable fishery. Empirically derived quotas and minimum size limits of 60 mm for P. granatina and 75 mm for P. argenvillei are suggested as the chief mechanisms for regulating a potential fishery. The need for a holistic approach to the management of living (particularly intertidal) resources is stressed.",

    "abstract": "Management action for the South African fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus varied considerably in the 1980s, as did numbers of pups, bulls and cows killed, their products (pelts, bull genitalia, meat and oil) and product prices. Since 1900, 2,7 million seals have been killed, the majority in Namibia. Most of these (92%) were pups. Numbers of pups have fluctuated, but-the average annual rate of growth has been approximately 3 per cent since 1972. Approximately two-thirds of the present seal population is on the Namibian coastline, and the remainder on the South African coast. In 1985, there was a large decrease in pup numbers, which was partially attributable to disturbance effects associated with bull-sealing, and to the removal of cows in preceding years. Estimated rates of sealing over the past two decades show that the rate at which pups have been killed has decreased from above 40 per cent to a few per cent, whereas that of bulls has increased but has not exceeded 8 per cent. The rate at which cows have been killed is negligible. Simulation modelling shows that a population : pup ratio used to provide rough estimates of total population size from pup numbers should be over 5:1, higher than the 4:1 or 4,49:1 previously used. In addition, variability in annual trends in both pup numbers and population size is much greater if there is disturbance associated with sealing. The analyses in this paper provide two recommendations for consideration by managers of the South African fur seal stock. First, a long-term management plan needs to be adopted and adhered to. Second, bull-sealing, if it involves disturbance at the colony, makes determination of the real extent of reduction of pup production difficult. Managers should be aware of this.",

Within these large systems, upwelling rate, primary production and fish production are all positively correlated, as would be expected on trophodynamic grounds. Existing measurements suggest that the Benguela and the Peru Current systems are 2–4 times more productive than the California Current in terms of primary production and support 2–10 times more fish per square kilometre. The Benguela and Peru Current systems are 2–3 times more efficient in production of fish and harvestable yield to man as the California Current. The California Current appears to be less efficient primarily because a greater fraction of the annual primary production is transported offshore from the major upwelling sites by the prevailing winds and meandering structure of the currents. The strong seasonal variability in upwelling off California probably also results in poor trophodynamic coupling between the herbivores and phytoplankton. Consequently, less of the phytoplankton is consumed and, potentially, more can be exported out of the system. Hake (Merluccius spp.) are opportunistic, apex predators of euphausiids and pelagic and demersal fish in the three upwelling systems. The striking dominance of euphausiids in the diet of hake in the California Current probably reflects the lesser abundance of demersal fish in that highly advective region.",

Prior to 1960, beach-seining was the most important source of fishing mortality, but angling catches have become increasingly important since then. Total annual catch for the period 1985–1990 is estimated at 30 000–35 000 fish, approximately 70% of which was taken by recreational anglers and 30% by commercial fishermen. In terms of mass, the catch was divided equally between the two fisheries. Long-term catch data indicate major declines. The reported mean annual commercial catch for the period 1983–1991 was only 14% of that for the years 1897–1906. The catch rate of recreational anglers has declined by 90% since the mid 1970s. Modelling of the responses of yield per recruit, spawner biomass per recruit and mean mass to altered fishing mortality (F) and age at recruitment into the catch (tc ) suggests that die stock is overexploited and that a substantial decrease in F and an increase in tc would benefit the fishery. It is suggested that benefit would accrue from increasing the minimum size limit to 65 cm (the length at 50% maturity) and restricting the \"Russman\" seine fishery on the western shores of False Bay to a 4–6 week season. All other restrictions on the commercial fishery ought to revert to the 1989 situation.",

Although catches were temporarily boosted to artificially high levels by reductions in minimum size, evidence is presented which suggests that sustainable yields may have declined largely as a result of environmental changes during and after the 1960s. It is postulated that a progressive expansion of oxygen-deficient shelf water may have forced lobsters to occupy a much-reduced habitat in shallow waters, where overcrowding has resulted in reduced growth and survival, and production and yields have declined accordingly. It is suggested that increased competition for food and space in the better-oxygenated shallows has led to a diminution in the size at sexual maturity of female lobsters and reduced adult growth rates. In addition, low levels of dissolved oxygen may have direct physiological effects on rates of feeding, growth and mortality. Possible reasons for the likely change in oxygen concentrations after the mid 1960s are discussed. Reduced grazing of phytoplankton by planktonic herbivores (zooplankton and clupeoid fish) as well as increased phytoplankton production per se are considered to be possible causative factors leading to the carbon-overloading prevalent in the central and northern Benguela system during the past two decades.",

    "abstract": "Rhinochimaera africana, a new species (Chondrichthyes, Chimaeriformes, Rhinochimaeridae), is described from five specimens from the Western Cape and KwaZulu coasts of southern Africa and from the Moçambique Channel between South-Western Madagascar and Europa Island. Two more specimens are known from off the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. It differs from the partially sympatric R. atlantica Holt and Byrne, 1909, and the Pacific R. pacifica (Mitsukuri, 1895) in its darker coloration, longer, broader, paddle-shaped snout, tooth plates of different shape, a more elongate-oval clasper glans, a shorter caudal fin with very short filament, and possibly a smaller dorsal fin and longer interdorsal space. R. africana males are mature at 568 mm body length (BDL), females adolescent at 476 mm BDL. A large, probably adult female of 650 mm BDL is larger than any recorded R. atlantica or R. africana. Wounds on two specimens indicate possible \"cookie-cutter\" bites by squaloid sharks, and one has a possible bite by another Rhinochimaera. Data on R. pacifica and R. atlantica, including 45 specimens from off Namibia and South Africa, are presented for comparison with R. africana. Caudal tubercle counts of R. africana (40–46) are intermediate between those of R. atlantica (most with 19–33, rarely up to 43) and of R. pacifica (41–68, rarely as low as 25–34). Southern African R. atlantica agree with North Atlantic R. atlantica in having few caudal tubercles, but there is slight overlap with R. pacifica in the case of higher counts recorded for R. africana. The systematics and distribution of the genus Rhinochimaera are reviewed, a terminology and abbreviation system for morphometries presented, and a key to species provided. The separation of R. atlantica and R. pacifica on caudal tubercle counts is provisionally accepted but considered problematical until adequate samples of both species can be critically compared. Proportional measurements and counts of caudal tubercles were highly variable in Rhinochimaera, with much allometry in proportions with growth and much individual variation. Selected morphometrics are plotted to show allometric trends in proportions that separate R. africana from other species.",

    "abstract": "The open-sea pelagic ecosystem is often thought of as a homogeneous environment allowing little room for biological accommodation between species — hence Hutchinson's \"paradox of the plankton\". By contrast, intertidal rocky shores are regarded as areas of high variability, both spatially and temporally, in which physical fluctuations result in biological patchiness and make it difficult to detect changes in community structure caused by biological interactions. The aim of this overview is to show that, in upwelled systems, particularly the Benguela, the pelagic ecosystem is far from homogeneous and that physical variation dominates many of the biological processes. Under these conditions, biotic interactions seldom determine the abundance or presence of particular species. To illustrate this fact, examples are drawn from the interaction between phytoplankton and zooplankton and between fish species. Nearshore and intertidal rocky coasts present an entirely different picture, in which (despite temporal and topographic variability) tightly knit biotic interactions may radically modify community structure. As one example, the role of birds (as predators and guano producers) is discussed. Another case, the relationship between rock lobsters, mussels and whelks, illustrates the principle that alternative stable states can be reached, depending entirely upon biological interactions.",

During August 1975, approximately hourly profiles of temperature, salinity and currents measured from a ship in 49 m of water over a period of six days permitted details of the bottom boundary layer (BBL) to be established. The height of the logarithmic layer was between 14 and 24 m, while Ekman veering took place over about 35 m. The BBL probably encompassed the whole water column, but processes at the sea surface also affected the conditions. Temperature and current data from a mooring in the vicinity compared favourably with the mean values obtained and indicated that conditions at the time were associated with an expected south-westward flow of the Agulhas Current. The results in the BBL, and an observed high-energy pulse, could be important in assessing mechanisms for sediment transport across the shelf.",

The gene products of 19 protein-coding loci in P. perna. C. meridionalis and in the newly recognized mussel were examined by means of horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis. The results showed that there was no allele-frequency overlap between any of these mussel taxa, thus implying little or no genetic relatedness between them. A morphological examination showed that the previously unreported mytilid has a pitted resilial ridge (similar to that of Perna), an anterior adductor muscle (unlike either Perna or Choromytilus), and an undivided posterior foot retractor-muscle scar (unlike Perna). Such features are diagnostic of the genus Mytilus. The South African Mytilus has morphological traits that are more characteristic of M. galloprovincialis of the Mediterranean Sea than of the more cosmopolitan M. edulis. which occurs in the northern and southern Pacific and Atlantic oceans. A large heterozygosity in Mytilus sp. argues against a recent dispersal from the Mediterranean Sea via a small founder population. Rather, the presence of Mytilus sp. in South Africa may represent a relict population of a wider geographic distribution of M. galloprovincialis resulting from Pleistocene cooling. However, the warmer water at lower latitudes could have still prevented dispersal of M. edulis, a species adapted to colder waters.",

Three distinct zones were evident, an inshore zone influenced by upwelling, an offshore warm oligotrophic zone and a transitional frontal zone separating the two. Salinity proved to be a useful indicator of recent water movements. There was evidence of intrusions and mixing of water types within the frontal zone, possibly accounting for the elevated phytoplankton biomass recorded there. Floral and faunal changes occurred between the frontal and offshore zones, corresponding to the thermal front. The predominant flow was alongshore, with strong equatorward jet currents, making the interpretation of cross-shelf gradients difficult in this dynamic area. Aspects of the distributions of organisms and their productivity across the upwelling front are described with respect to the hydrographic parameters and associated flow-field.",

It is, however, considered to be economically important in terms of equipment outlay (± R17 million) and running expenses (± Rl,65 million). Sampling of catches in 1979 and 1980 showed that of 79 recorded species only 17 were important. Ski-boaters compete with commercial line fishermen for target species, but there is little overlap with the trawl fishery. The paucity of historical line-fish catch records, the multispecies nature and the seasonality of the fishery make management problematical.",

The requirements for obtaining clear, truly rational understanding of any patterns of change that are caused by climate-driven ocean variability or any subsequent ecological processes are: (1) recognition that at least some basic hypotheses must be examined over a fairly long term, i.e. more than only some short portion(s) of usually cyclic processes; (2) that ecological interactions must be accounted for in a similar, reasonably coherent manner; (3) time-series and information collection must include all the habitat, including all boundaries and their perturbations, as well as specific events and processes that have impacts on local fishery production. It will always be necessary to expect that there are several potentially perturbing processes going on at any one time, but the dominant process will vary in time and space, frustrating applications of simplistic, one-process models. These models tend to overintegrate the effects of many perturbing factors and to underemphasize relative effects of what in specific cases are of potential high impact compared with usual considerations.",

Mesoscale patches of tar-ball concentrations appeared to move onto the Agulhas Bank from the south between 20 and 21°E, under the influence of prevailing winds and currents. Substantial concentrations were observed inshore and offshore in the region east of Cape Agulhas. Data of a hydrological and meteorological nature, on ship's drift and from drift cards have shown the existence of a zone of surface divergence extending southwards from Cape Agulhas. Surface water east of Cape Agulhas (20°E) tends to move slowly eastwards and northwards and water west of the same longitude has a predominantly westerly component. The surface currents east of Cape Agulhas would tend to move the tar balls, which accumulate in eddies in the area, on shore, whereas west of Cape Agulhas on-shore flow is less pronounced. The residence time of tar balls on the Agulhas Bank appears to be substantial, in the range 2—8 weeks. It is concluded that the beaches between Cape Agulhas and Mossel Bay are highly susceptible to pollution by oil and tar balls.",

Otoliths (n = 750) were selected from fish ranging between 60 and 1 310 mm total length. Ages of 0–25 years were recorded, but fish older than 13 years were uncommon. Marginal increment analysis indicated that for fish of age 2–11 years, one opaque and one translucent zone were deposited annually. The first annulus was validated using daily rings. Observed lengths-at-age were highly variable. There was no statistical difference in growth rate between fish taken in the Southern and South-Eastern Cape. Growth rates between sexes did not differ significantly on the East Coast. Fish in the South-Western Cape initially grew faster than those in the other two regions, but the growth rate showed earlier and a smaller maximum size was attained. The growth models which best fitted the observed length-at-age data were the Richards for the East Coast (South-Eastern and Southern Cape combined) and the logistic for the South-Western Cape. Growth is described by the equations: Lt = 1 141,8 (1 + 0,261 e−0,646(t−6,928))−0.261 mm for the East Coast, Lt = 1 087 (1 + e−0,409(t−3,339))−1 mm for the South-Western Cape. The relationships between otolith dimensions (length, height, mass, and ostium to cauda distance) and fish length in each of three regions suggested that South African A. inodorus exist as at least three stocks. The nature of growth zones in the sectioned otoliths supported this conclusion.",

At that early stage it was realized that few, if any, recognized management procedures existed for newly developing fisheries, especially with the paucity of data such as existed on Namibian orange roughy. The development of the Namibian orange roughy fishery is reviewed to document the management strategies implemented and how the management of the fishery evolved. The first six years of the fishery are described, including the three-year exploration phase, several years of profitable exploitation, and the severe decline in catch rates. Whether the decline is attributable to fishing mortality or to change in the aggregating behaviour of orange roughy, or both, is not clear. Although many aspects of the precautionary approach were followed, a risk analysis applied and a number of innovative management methods implemented (e.g. incentives to promote exploratory fishing, use of Bayesian statistical methods, implementation of a management plan for long-term total allowable catches), the aggregating biomass declined to between 10 and 50% of virgin levels within the six years. The management methods applied are evaluated in the light of the severe decline in catch rate experienced in 1998 and 1999, so that others may learn from the experience.",

    "abstract": "The impact of climate on the fishery for jack mackerel Trachurus declivis off Tasmania has been traced to an interaction of the 40-day oscillation in the Zonal Westerly Wind (ZWW), driven by latitudinal changes in the position of the subtropical high pressure cells over south-eastern Australia, with ocean circulation and water column stability. Nitrate concentrations are strongly correlated with temperature in these waters. High ZWW stress causes advection of colder, nutrient-rich subantarctic water up the eastern side of Tasmania and reduces water column stability. The result is periodic overturn of the water column and increased new production. Spring blooms tend to be later, but stronger, as a result of periodic mixing and restratification. Reduced ZWW stress (under the influence of high pressure) leads to incursions of subtropical water, increased water column stability and reduced biological production. In calm years spring blooms tend to be earlier, but weaker, because of the reduced nitrate availability. Changes in the strength of the 40-day oscillation cause changes in the dominant zooplankton populations: from salps in windy periods, through a mixture of krill and salps in normal years, to copepods in calm periods. Reduced nutrient availability in warm years leads to reduced new production and a drastic reduction in the biomass of larger zooplankton, especially krill. In summer, jack mackerel feed on krill in coastal waters. If krill are rare and do not swarm in sufficient numbers, the jack mackerel do not school in commercial quantities and the fishery fails. These events have occurred at about 10-year intervals during anti-ENSO events. This is a very clear example of climate-induced, \"bottom up\" control of the distribution of a commercial fish stock.",

    "abstract": "Following the legal recognition of subsistence fishers in 1998 through the promulgation of the Marine Living Resources Act, a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) was appointed by national government to provide recommendations on the management of subsistence fishing in South Africa. To achieve effective management, the SFTG recognized that fishers' needs, perceptions and concerns must be understood and incorporated into future management strategies. As a result, information from fishers was gathered through a five-month research programme that included questionnaire surveys, focus-group meetings, a \"roadshow\" and a national workshop. Research findings indicated that the fishers' responses centred on four key themes related to (1) the criteria for defining a subsistence fisher, (2) current management practices, (3) resource use and (4) livelihood strategies. Feedback from fishers revealed several issues that have led to uncertainty and dissatisfaction among informal and subsistence fishers. However, these perceptions need to be contextualized within the historical circumstances of fisheries management in South Africa, and it must be recognized that attitudes will only change when management approaches embrace the needs, perceptions and concerns of the users. The information outlined in this paper was instrumental in guiding the formulation of the SFTG recommendations regarding the definition of subsistence fishers and their future management in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, sardine Sardinops sagax spawning has been recorded inshore off central Namibia. Field observations on eggs and laboratory measurements show that spawning, demonstrated by the distribution of newly spawned eggs, takes place just below the upper mixed layer. The high positive buoyancy of the eggs causes them to ascend rapidly to the surface layer, where they are moved offshore by upwelling-induced offshore transport. However, increased wind-induced mixing also influences the vertical distribution of eggs, causing them to be partly mixed down below the layer moving offshore and into the layer moving inshore. This mechanism acts to retard the transport and offshore loss of eggs from the spawning areas. The vertical distribution of sardine larvae, with highest concentrations deeper than 20 m, indicates active movement out of the layer moving offshore, and this tendency seems to be more pronounced for older larvae. Hence, vertical migration of larvae is an additional factor mitigating their loss from nearshore. Taken together, these features seem to minimize the offshore loss of offspring, particularly in periods of low stock biomass when spawning close to the shore seems to be common.",

The average total biomass of G. aestuaria in the estuary was 219 kg, with a maximum value of 723 kg dry mass recorded in November 1986. Daily food consumption by the estuarine round herring ranged from 0,6 mg·m−3·day−1 in the lower reaches to 20,4 mg·m−3·day−1 in the middle reaches. On average, G. aestuaria consumed almost 19 kg dry mass of food per day in the Sundays Estuary during 1986/87, or 6,9 tons dry mass per year. Most food consumption occurred during summer (37 kg·day−-1), compared to only 1 kg·day−1 in winter. The higher summer consumption coincides with increased zooplankton abundance in the Sundays system during the warmer months. Calculations indicate that production by the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei in the Sundays Estuary could provide at least 50% of the food requirements of the resident G. aestuaria population.",

The otoliths were viewed burnt and unburnt, the former giving slightly clearer zone patterns under reflected light. The otoliths have a crenulated edge and exhibit stacking of growth zones, which prevented accurate measurement of zone growth and back-calculation of age. Seasonality of zone formation was not determined because interpretation of the crenulated margin was difficult. Data analysis included down-weighting age-length points for which the age estimates were determined imprecisely. Von Bertalanffy and Schnute growth models were fitted to the data. The best fit to the whole data set was obtained with the Schnute model. Differences in growth between males and females were not statistically significant, possibly because of the poor precision of the fit to the data set for females. Red steenbras live to at least 33 years and attain sexual maturity at approximately 7,2 years. Per-recruit analysis suggests that they are highly susceptible to overfishing, particularly because juveniles are effectively unprotected by current minimum size regulations. The consequences of this include the possibility of growth- and recruitment-overfishing.",

In all, 32 teleost and two cephalopod species were recorded. The pelagic shoaling pilchard Sardinops ocellatus, anchovy Engraulis capensis and saury Scomberesox saurus scombroides were identified as the main prey species. The diet composition showed marked interannual fluctuations during the sampling period, which appear to be related to changes in the abundance of the main prey species. The relative abundance of pilchard, anchovy and saury was also found to change intra-annually, the first two species occurring more frequently in the diet during the breeding season and saury dominating the diet in the non-breeding season. These changes are thought to originate from temporal variation in the oceanographic regime within the foraging range of the gannets.",

The western Agulhas Bank is largely driven by the Benguela system and derives its higher nutrient values from coastal upwelling; the shelf-edge of the eastern Agulhas Bank is under the influence of the Agulhas Current, which only contributes nutrient-poor water at the surface, whereas the major part of the eastern Agulhas Bank is under the influence of the far-eastern Agulhas Bank upwelling cell, which provides nutrient-rich bottom water. Seasonal changes in nutrient distributions over the whole Agulhas Bank are driven by strong vertical stratification in summer and the erosion of this stratification, by vertical mixing, in winter. During summer, nutrient concentrations in the surface layers are characteristic of Subtropical Surface Water; those in bottom water derive from Central Water.",

Just 10 species accounted for 75, 83 and 90% of the catch of the shore, recreational and commercial skiboat fishery respectively. The average catch per unit effort (cpue) was low in all sectors, 1.15 kg fisher−1 day−1 in the shorefishery, 9.4 kg fisher−1 day−1 in the recreational skiboat fishery and 21.5 kg fisher−1 day−1 in the commercial skiboat fishery. Catch data showed that professional and club anglers are more successful fishers. Comparisons with historic records for Port Elizabeth revealed that the cpue in the shore fishery had declined markedly, whereas the total effort increase was negligible (0.1%). In addition, the species composition of the fishery has changed.",

Intraspecific increase in density resulted in reductions in growth and tissue mass of C. capensis and increased mortality of both species. Sublethal effects of competition on S. concinna were not studied. Survivorship and growth of C. capensis were not significantly affected by the presence of S. concinna. Interspecific effects on tissue mass, however, were noted, particularly at high densities; they were attributed to interference competition. Inclusion of C. capensis in enclosures did not affect mortality of S. concinna. The intensity of interactions varied seasonally, highest mortalities and the greatest reduction in growth and tissue mass being observed during summer/autumn. Considerable variation in the level of chlorophyll a measured within enclosures reflects major differences in the feeding methodologies of the two species, differences that are undoubtedly a major factor in determining the outcome of competitive interactions between these species.",

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal \"small-scale commercial\" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches. Co-management, involving both authorities and users in joint management, is advocated in preference to previous top-down approaches, because of its potential to improve communication and compliance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAnchovy biomass and copepod standing stocks and growth rates on the Agulhas Bank were compared during the peak spawning period (November) in 1988 and 1989. In 1988, copepod biomass over the western Agulhas Bank was low (1,0 g dry mass·m−2) relative to anchovy biomass there (14,7 g dry mass·m−2). In November 1989 in the same area, fish biomass was much lower (5,7 g dry mass·m−2), following a recruitment failure, and copepod biomass was higher (2,4 g dry mass·m−2), possibly as a result of lesser predation by anchovy. By contrast, the eastern Agulhas Bank had a larger biomass of copepods (4–6 g dry mass·−2) and a lower biomass of anchovy during both years. Knowing, from laboratory studies, that a prey biomass of 0,78 g·m−2 is required for fish to obtain their daily maintenance ration, it is suggested that spawning on the western Agulhas Bank was food-limited in 1988. Copepods on the western Bank may be replaced by local growth or transport from the eastern Bank. Growth rates of copepods on the western Bank were 10–50 per cent of maximum in 1988, but total production (c. 100 mg dry mass·m−2·day−1) was low, primarily because biomass was low and less than the rate of consumption by anchovy (243 mg copepod dry mass·m−2·day−1). On the eastern Bank, copepod production exceeded anchovy consumption and it is concluded that the flux of copepod biomass onto the western Bank may be as important as local growth in replenishing copepod stocks there. Feeding conditions for anchovy on the western Agulhas Bank are often marginal compared to the situation on the eastern Bank, and it is suggested that the selection of the western Bank as the major spawning area is related more to the success of transport and survival of eggs and larvae on the West Coast recruiting grounds than to feeding conditions per se.",

    "abstract": "Carnivorous zooplankton in the Benguela system have tended to be ignored by all but early taxonomists and a handful of recent researchers. An attempt is made here to address the importance of carnivores in this system but, because the database is poor, it was necessary to apply material from outside the region. The taxa covered include ctenophores, cnidarians (Scyphozoa and Hydrozoa, including Siphonophora), chaetognaths and hyperiid amphipods as well as such minor groups as pelagic gastropods and decapods. Most groups of carnivores within the Benguela are represented by only one or two \"common\" species. These tend to be epiplanktonic and generally concentrated inshore of the shelf-break, where their distributions are influenced by changes in local hydrography. Their densities frequently exceed those of herbivores. The dominant carnivores share a number of attributes: wide-ranging diets, high assimilation and growth efficiencies and mostly a Type I functional response to food concentration. They fall into two categories. The first is the gelatinous species, which have short lifespans and exhibit rapid growth and often massive reproductive response to high concentrations of food. They are patchily distributed and some appear to have behavioural traits that enable them to stay within localized patches of prey on which they may be dependent because of high metabolic costs. In the second category are crustacean predators and chaetognaths which have slower response times to the food environment but may have longer lifespans, lower daily maintenance needs and an ability to store lipids. They are less dependent on high densities of food organisms and can survive throughout winter, when gelatinous predators are rare. The effect of predation on abundance of copepods is estimated on the basis of both published and unpublished data. Should swarms of predators coincide with a critical gateway of zooplankton or larvae, then there may be total depletion. This applies especially to the nearshore zone of the West Coast and to semi-enclosed bays. The role of carnivorous zooplankton in the diets of commercially important fish species is stressed, but their importance in the regeneration of nutrients may be insignificant.",

Upwelled water is derived from South Atlantic Central Water, which is heated at the sea surface to a maximum of 23°C. A volumetric analysis for the same geographic area shows that, for the area as a whole, South Atlantic Subtropical Surface Water is dominant at the sea surface and that, furthermore, the volumes of Central Water available for upwelling are invariant with bivariate t/s class. This suggests that the origin of upwelled water, and the intensity of upwelling, may be estimated from salinity readings only.",

There was no salinity gradient in the system during any of the surveys, but between the surveys there were considerable salinity differences. Summer turbidities were higher than those of winter and spring, and turbidity along the eastern edge of the system was lower than elsewhere. Chlorophyll a was present over a wide range of salinities and turbidities and was generally highest in summer. However, there was no relationship between salinity and concentrations of chlorophyll a, and the concentrations were not significantly higher along the less turbid eastern shore. Concentrations of total paniculate matter (TPM) and particulate organic matter (POM) in the < 100 μm fraction were significantly correlated with turbidity throughout the year, but chlorophyll a and POM (< 100 μm) were significantly correlated only in summer. Concentrations of TPM in the > 100 μm fraction were two orders of magnitude lower than those in the < 100 μm fraction, but the organic content of the former fraction was very much higher. There was no relationship between turbidity and TPM (> 100 μm), nor between chlorophyll a and POM (> 100 μm) concentrations. Under conditions of high TPM load and in the salinity range 2–25 × 10−3, phytoplankton would probably still occur in St Lucia. Estimates of phytoplankton production ranged between 218 and 252 mg C·m−2·day−1. A comparison of estimates of the standing stocks of carbon from phytoplankton and suspended POM < 100 μm indicated that carbon input from sources other than phytoplankton may be important.",

Females of both species tend to mature at a greater length and age than their male counterparts, 50-per-cent maturity being achieved at some 470–480 mm and 360–380 mm (∼ 4.8 and ∼ 3.8 years) respectively. For both species, females undoubtedly and males probably shed all sexual products at each spawning, but there is evidence from the long spawning season of serial spawning or of spawning of different batches offish at different times. It is concluded that Cape hakes in the study area spawn in a double wave, the first wave in November/December sustained by both species and the second one in February/March mainly by Merluccius paradoxus. Females dominate the sex ratios by 1,5: 1 and 1,7: 1 for M. capensis and M. paradoxus respectively. In mature, larger fish, the dominance is even greater, particularly so in M. paradoxus, of which species males were scarce. The rate of instantaneous natural mortality M was calculated from age at maturity. M for males was higher (0,42–0,44) than for females (0,33–0,34) and an unweighted mean value of 0,4 was calculated for Cape hake in the study area.",

Off the Cape of Good Hope, M. capensis was never found deeper than 440 m, and there was significant species overlap between 150 and 440 m. M. paradoxus was numerically dominant except at the shallowest station sampled (150 m). Little overlap of mature specimens of each species was recorded. The research data were applied to commercial trawl statistics, revealing that M. capensis accounted for only 12,9 per cent by mass and 4,8 per cent by number of the commercially caught hake in the years 1955–1974.

Results were compared with Clarke's analysis of cephalopod beaks collected in 1963 (Clarke 1980). There was no significant difference in the incidence of food in the stomachs between whales taken in the morning (07:15–11:15), at midday (11:15–15:15) or in the afternoon (after 15:15). The incidence of food remains was less in medium-sized (12.2–13.7 m) and large (≥ 14 m) males than in small (≤ 11.9 m) males and females, and their stomachs more frequently contained the beaks of cephalopod species from the Antarctic or subAntarctic. These phenomena were related to a winter migration of medium-sized and large males into the whaling ground from south of the Subtropical Convergence. Medium-sized and large males fed more frequently on larger species of endemic cephalopods than females or small males, whereas males in general ate larger individuals of a cephalopod species than females. Because larger and older individuals within a cephalopod species are frequently distributed deeper than other individuals, males may feed lower in the water column than females. Evidence from catch positions and the incidence of non-cephalopod prey items suggests that some males within the West Coast whaling ground moved into the continental slope water (200–1 000 m deep), where they dived to the sea floor and took benthic organisms such as rajids, crabs, Lophius sp. and Allocyttus sp. Females stayed farther offshore, where both sexes fed mesopelagically, consuming mesopelagic-bathypelagic cephalopods, Ruvettus sp., mysids and ceratids. Some of the differences in distribution and feeding behaviour between males and females may reflect adaptations to the social organization of the species.",

Catch per haul of the target species Liza richardsonii in May (autumn) and October (spring) was double that recorded in summer, even though effort was only half of that during summer. Effort was largely dependent on the frequency of occurrence of patches of the surf-zone diatom Anaulus birostratus, on which L. richardsonii feed and around which the nets were set. Species important in recreational anglers' catches, namely Lithognathus lithognathus, Diplodus sargus capensis, Rhabdosargus globiceps, Seriola lalandi, Dichistius capensis, Pomatomus saltatrix, Umbrina canariensis and Argyrosomus hololepidotus, were also more abundant in spring, summer and autumn. It is concluded that the present winter closed season, during which \"angling\" fish have to be released, is not having the desired effect of reducing the total catch of these species because they are more abundant in summer. A possible alternative to the present partially closed season would be to disallow seine-netting on weekends and public holidays. This may reduce the total catch of \"angling\" species by 30%.",

Fish prey consisted of 51% pelagic, mainly anchovy (33%), round herring (11%) and pilchard, 24% horse mackerel and 17% demersal fish, mainly M. capensis. This dietary composition contrasts with that documented for the same species on the West Coast, where crustaceans and mesopelagic fish are more important in the diet of small and medium-sized (<50 cm) M. capensis, and horse mackerel are of minor importance in the diet of larger hake. Cannibalism was a more prominent feature in M. capensis on the South Coast (accounting for up to 25% of the diet) than it is on the West Coast, where interspecific (hake-on-hake) predation on Merluccius paradoxus is common. On the South Coast, M. capensis adapt their diet not only to exploit larger prey species but also larger prey items within a species, the length and size range of prey increasing significantly with predator length. The maximum ingestible prey size was around 50% of body length. Hake as small as 15 cm were piscivorous and cannibalistic, but the minimum length at which hake preyed on horse mackerel was 30 cm, and generally fish >15 cm were consumed at that length. Horse mackerel was an important food source for large M. capensis (>50 cm) on the South Coast.",

The energy ingestion equations are converted to equations of biomass ingestion using the calorific content of prey. The calorific contents of 14 of the major species in the diet were estimated using bomb calorimetry and ranged between 3,65 and 7,73 kJ·g−1.

The cool temperature signal was restricted to a shallow surface layer, and the filament was entrained around a large cyclonic eddy. Offshore transport in the filament, in excess of 1 Sv, may be a major influence in dispersal of material originating in the region of active coastal upwelling. The location of the filament studied appears repeatable from year to year, suggestive of a strong relation with the topographically trapped eddy, which was situated downstream of a lateral ridge between the Canary Islands and the African coast.",

    "abstract": "The South African sardine Sardinops sagax resource is subjected to both directed fishing that targets adult fish, and bycatch of both juvenile and adult fish taken in the directed fisheries for anchovy Engraulis capensis and round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi. Two separate TACs (Total Allowable Catch) for sardine are calculated in the management procedures considered. The first is a directed TAC linked to sardine abundance, and the second is a bycatch TAC with an \"anchovy\" component coupled to the anchovy population dynamics as a proportion of the anchovy TAC, plus a \"round herring\" component reflecting a fixed tonnage independent of round herring abundance. Requirements from the pelagic industry, such as a minimum economically viable annual directed catch and a maximum percentage decrease in the directed TAC that could be tolerated from year to year are also incorporated. The selection of a single management procedure for implementation is based on the comparison of performance statistics such as risk of severe depletion and average annual catch, which incorporate the consequences of random error in survey estimates of abundance and random fluctuations in recruitment from year to year. Sensitivity tests are carried out to ensure robustness over a range of alternative assumptions concerning resource dynamics. A description is given of the development of the management procedure for sardine that was implemented in 1994, and the rationale for its selection. A wide range of variants to this procedure, including those that consider alternative approaches for handling bycatch, are investigated. Performance of the management procedures considered demonstrates extreme sensitivity to the choice of the proportion of the anchovy TAC used in the sardine bycatch TAC calculation. A lack of robustness of the selected management procedure to possible bias in estimates of spawner biomass from hydroacoustic surveys, and poor precision of recruit survey estimates are argued as justification for adopting a conservative approach for managing sardine.",

When visually assessed, 82.1% of the I. coindetii stomachs and 73.4% of the T. eblanae stomachs had no food remains present. In both I. coindetii and T. eblanae stomachs with prey, crustaceans, particularly euphausids, are relatively more important as prey in smaller squid. As the squid grow, fish and squid become increasingly important prey. The small mesopelagic fish Maurolicus muelleri is a particularly important prey item of both species, occurring in 48.3% of I. coindetii and 34.7% of T. eblanae stomachs with prey remains. M. muelleri otoliths were also often found in high numbers. In one I. coindetii stomach, 43 pairs of otoliths were found. However, this great abundance may be an over-representation of their importance in the diet as a result of the techniques used to identify prey remains in squid stomachs. Three other pelagic fish, Gadiculus argenteus, Micromesistius poutassou, Argentina sp. and the euphausid Meganyctiphanes norvegica, are also important prey of both species. Data on possible trawlnet-associated feeding are also presented, although the importance of this as a source of error in diet studies is unclear. Using data from research vessel surveys, there seems to be a peak in feeding intensity in the early morning in I. coindetti.",

Selectivity indices showed that recruits occurred exclusively on encrusting coralline algae and showed preferences for strongly textured corallines, rather than those with smooth texture. On smooth corallines, around 80% of recruits were under urchins, compared with about 25% on textured corallines, suggesting that any need for shelter beneath urchins is greatest on smooth surfaces.",

The coast was subdivided into 20 ?beats? to provide high spatial resolution on catch and effort of the shore-based recreational fishery. An observer recorded the number of anglers in each fishery sector, and their catch, during shore patrols over a two-year period. Catch-and-effort data for the commercial boat-based fishery were obtained from an historical database at the turn of last century and from the extant National Marine Linefish System database. Catch per unit effort (cpue) of shore-anglers was low and many of the species caught earlier in the century have disappeared from catches. Compared to the early records, contemporary commercial linefish cpue had dropped by approximately 80%, despite a greater fishing capacity. It is argued that most targeted stocks have been overexploited (notwithstanding indications of environmental change) and many are severely depleted. Poor management of the fishery, including a lack of control of commercial effort and inadequate enforcement, contributed to overexploitation.",

Just 23 years later the number of known species has doubled to an estimated 195, represented in the South African Museum collection by 4 252 accessioned lots (15 434 specimens, excluding many paralarvae). In 1995, cephalopods constituted the sixth most valuable fisheries resource worldwide (after shrimps and tunas). Only one subspecies, Loligo vulgaris reynaudii, is targeted in South Africa at present, but it is important commercially because of the high prices it commands internationally. A number of other species constitute alternate resources of potential commercial interest, including at least 12 sepiids, 7 loliginids, 6 ommastrephids and 9 octopods. Cephalopods are also important in the trophic relations of marine fish, birds and mammals. Knowledge of the southern African cephalopod fauna is important not only for regional biodiversity studies but also from a wider perspective. The region is strategically placed between the Atlantic, Indian and Southern oceans and the faunal composition is complex. The southern African cephalopods include about 20–30% of the known world cephalopod species. Resolution of taxonomic problems in the southern African context goes a long way towards global resolution, particularly among the oceanic species. The size and complexity of the South African Museum's cephalopod collection prompted the holding of a systematics workshop to produce a guide to southern African cephalopods. This paper provided a basis for that Biodiversity Workshop. A provisional checklist for the region is provided, species constituting a potential resource for either artisanal or larger fisheries are identified and unresolved problems in the systematics (including an undescribed genus and at least 12, but probably more than 20, new species) are indicated.",

This fraction is interpreted as a potential reduction of fishing mortality. The effectiveness of DBLs on the recreational shore-fishery of the Western Cape is assessed using catch data of competition anglers. Only Dichistius capensis, Lithognathus lithognathus, Diplodus sargus capensis and Argyrosomus spp. were species recorded frequently enough for a DBL evaluation. Data from the period 1971-1984 suggest that the DBLs introduced at the end of 1984 were likely to have reduced fishing mortality (F) by 5% for D. capensis, but by no more than 1% for any of the other three species. Data from the period 1985–1992 suggest that the revised DBLs introduced in 1992 further reduced F by 1,9% for L. lithognathus, 0,1% for Argyrosomus spp. and 2,4% for D. sargus capensis. A reduction in the DBL of these three species is proposed. For several species, the reduction of F as a result of a DBL is correlated with the mean annual cpue, indicating that this restriction loses its effectiveness with decreasing fish density. An estimate of the annual increase in effort is essential for deciding on appropriate DBLs. Multispecies DBLs are disadvantageous in several respects, and it is suggested that they be abolished in favour of individual species DBLs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The availability of resources and their suitability for subsistence and small-scale commercial fishers in South Africa were assessed and appropriate options for the management of resources recommended. Assessment of current resource utilization and recommendations for future subsistence and/or small-scale commercial use were based on information gathered during a nationwide survey of 144 subsistence fishing communities in South Africa and a review of relevant published and unpublished literature. Current patterns of resource use in three regions of the coast (West, South and East coasts) revealed that most true subsistence fisheries occur in the eastern half of the country. These fisheries are primarily focused on invertebrate species found on intertidal rocky shores and sandy beaches, or in estuaries. Fish are harvested by rod or handline, netting or traditional fishing methods (fishtraps, spearing, baited baskets). No \"new\" or previously underutilized resources were identified as suitable for subsistence fishing in any of the three regions. The potential for several new small-scale commercial fisheries was identified, but the need to retain certain resources for subsistence fisheries (rather than converting them to small-scale commercial fisheries) was evident in certain areas. Resources with high commercial value were not considered suitable for subsistence fishing, but rather for the introduction of small-scale commercial fisheries. The overall management strategy for the subsistence sector, which is currently in the process of being developed, must ensure sufficient flexibility to be able to take into account regional and site-specific requirements. It will also need to develop co-management structures, protect traditional fishing practices, avoid user conflict and provide for no-take areas, all within the framework of sustainable resource utilization.

Species which may prove important as a result of further research are Lolliguncula mercatoris, Ommastrephes bartramii, Todarodes filippovae, Histioteuthis miranda and Abraliopsis gilchristi. \"Importance\" is defined on the basis of \"survey abundance\" (including commercial fisheries) and their trophic links with other organisms. Use of the latter criterion indicates that Sepia australis, Todaropsis eblanae and Lycoteuthis ?diadema are sufficiently abundant to be exploited by fisheries. Unknown factors are dispersal, availability and market considerations. The only examples of cephalopods feeding on commercial species of fish are Loligo v. reynaudii feeding on anchovy Engraulis capensis and Cape hakes Merluccius capensis and/or M. paradoxus in the southern Benguela and Todarodes angolensis preying on Cape hake in the northern Benguela. Such feeding is opportunistic and is not believed to threaten the fish stocks. Predators of cephalopods are mostly opportunistic, switching to other prey when cephalopods are not available. There is no evidence that such predators pose a threat to the Loligo fisheries. The opportunistic nature of cephalopods as prey and predators makes quantification of predation (in both directions) difficult. Data for such quantification are, as yet, unavailable.",

Light-tackle boat competition data and shore-angling data from the South African National Marine Linefish System for the years 1976–1991 were used to analyse angler catch rates and catch per species for the Harbour. A total of 85 species of both marine and estuarine-associated ichthyofauna was caught. The Harbour is used as a nursery area by juvenile fish and as a feeding ground and refuge by adult fish. The catch composition varied inter-annually, but it was dominated by the Haemulidae, particularly Pomadasys commersonnii, and the Mugilidae. The majority of fish caught by light-tackle boat anglers were above the minimum legal size, but fell within small size-classes. The catch rate declined over the 16 years, probably attributable to a combination of loss of habitat, flooding in 1987, poor water quality, disturbance by harbour traffic and possibly overexploitation of fish stocks. It is concluded that careful management and efficient policing of the Harbour are essential prerequisites to ensure sustainable catches in the future.",

    "abstract": "Subsistence fishers were first recognized as a formal fishing sector in South Africa when new fishing legislation, aimed at redressing past inequalities, was enacted in 1998. Little information was available about these fishers, their activities, and the resources upon which they rely. Recognizing the imperative to gain an understanding of the fishers and to consult broadly, the national agency responsible for the management of marine living resources, Marine and Coastal Management (MCM) of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) in December 1998 to provide advice on the implementation of appropriate management systems for subsistence fisheries. This paper describes the process followed to formulate recommendations that were presented by the SFTG to MCM in February 2000. The activities of the SFTG fell into two categories: research aimed at identifying subsistence fishers and gaining an understanding of their activities and socio-economic profiles; and consultation aimed at ensuring that the needs and aspirations of fishers and the experience of local managers were incorporated. Research included both field-based studies and synthesis of information about comparative fisheries elsewhere. Consultation took the form of local interviews and focus-group discussions, meetings with fishers and a national workshop. A pivotal activity was the development of a clear definition and qualifying criteria for subsistence fishers. A significant outcome was the identification of a separate small-scale commercial sector, previously erroneously lumped with subsistence fishers. Needs of fishers and problems identified during the process provided the basis for recommendations in the following areas: definitions, assessment and categorization of resources, management systems, communication mechanisms, application and allocation procedures, capacity building, compliance, research and monitoring, and funding and staff required for the management of this new sector. An evaluation is made of the opportunities presented by the SFTG process, constraints experienced and lessons learnt, giving important insights that are applicable to other similar processes, yet seldom documented in formal literature.",

Tagging studies indicated consistent inter-island differences in lobster growth rates and size composition which were unrelated to fishing intensity. A combined diving/trapfishing survey was conducted during March/April 1989 to investigate possible reasons for observed differences in lobster growth, size composition and sizes at maturity at Nightingale and Inaccessible, two small islands just south of Tristan da Cunha. Differences in water temperature were not considered to be relevant owing to the two islands' proximity to each other. Although it was thought that food availability to the lobster stocks might be the underlying cause for the inter-island differences, an intensive diving survey failed to reveal any obvious differences in the benthic biota of the two islands. Predation by fish on small lobsters is intense at all islands, but at Inaccessible the topography of the shallow subtidal zone (where most puerulus larvae settle) affords more shelter to young lobsters than at Nightingale. Survival of juvenile lobsters is thus relatively enhanced, resulting in higher densities of recruiting lobsters at Inaccessible, a feature confirmed by diving as well as analysis of trap catch per unit effort and size composition. The observed inter-island differences in lobster population structure therefore appear to be caused by differences in density-dependent growth and survival of young lobsters. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to yield per recruit, egg production per recruit and the effects of minimum size regulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Between 1978 and 1990, 209 Java sharks Carcharhinus amboinensis were caught in the shark nets that protect the swimming beaches of Natal, thereby constituting 0,5 per cent of the total shark catch. The catch rate was relatively constant at about 0,4 sharks·km net−1·year−1. Catches were highest at the northernmost beaches in summer and autumn and they consisted mostly of juvenile, but not newborn, and adolescent sharks. Specimens ranged from 99 to 176 cm PCL, with a mode of 131–135 cm for males and 131–145 cm for females. Males matured at 150 cm and females at 160 cm. Of the eight mature females caught, five were pregnant. Mating takes place in late summer and gestation is thought to last approximately 12 months. The largest embryo found was 53 cm. Teleosts were identified in 62,1 per cent of the 103 stomachs that contained food. Elasmobranchs (44,7%), crustaceans (12,6%) and cephalopods (11,6%) were the other major prey groups. Most of the fish prey were demersal, associated with soft bottoms.",

The 37 most abundant species selected for analysis represented 78-&ndash96 per cent of the total estimated biomass. The biomass of most of them decreased over the period of study. However, the decreases were only substantial for winter cruises; the fluctuations recorded on the summer cruises appeared to be more closely related to hydrographic conditions. In relatively cool summers the estimated biomasses of seven species (including Merluccius capensis and Lophius vomerinus) were quite similar to, or lower than, the biomasses estimated six months earlier. In contrast, the estimated biomasses of the same seven species during relatively warm summers were distinctly higher than the estimates made the previous winter. In all, 10 species, including the commercially important Austroglossus microlepis, Lophius vomerinus and Merluccius capensis, were more available to bottom trawls in summer than in winter. Multivariate analysis revealed several distinct assemblages separated by latitude and depth, but with seasonal variation. Similarity indices between cruises were high (mean Schoener index around 0,7), indicating that changes in biomass do not affect the structure of the demersal fish community. It is suggested that, although the high levels of fishing effort deployed in the region lowered the total fish biomass, community stability, expressed as absence of change in species assemblages, was significantly high.",

Multivariate analysis revealed a clear distinction between cephalopods of the upper and lower continental slope in both benthic and epibenthic habitats. Todaropsis eblanae and Todarodes angolensis were indicator species for the upper slope benthic, from 300 to 500 m, but on the lower slope, in 700–900 m of water, they were replaced by Histioteuthis miranda and Opisthoteuthis agassizii. In the epibenthic, both upper and lower slopes were dominated by Abraliopsis gilchristi and Lycoteuthis ?diadema, but other species characteristic of the lower slope were the oceanic species Mastigoteuthis hjorti, Ctenopteryx sicula and Taonius sp. A. Cranchia scabra indicated the presence of oceanic water at stations 700–900 m deep. Other species of significance in the catches were Todarodes filippovae, Histioteuthis macrohista, Rossia enigmatica and Bathypolypus valdiviae. Species affinities indicate that the cephalopod fauna of the southern African continental slope includes the following zoogeographic components: southern African endemic, circum-Subantarctic species associated with Antarctic Intermediate Water, circum-global southern tropical/subtropical, tropical Indo-Pacific and cosmopolitan tropical/subtropical.",

The mean monthly production of chlorophyll a, which ranged from 0,3 to 2,0 μg·cm−2. was inversely correlated with tidal elevation. Highest rates of production (3,5–6,0 μg·cm−2) were recorded in winter at all tidal levels. The amplitude of seasonal fluctuations decreased with tidal height. At the middle and upper levels standing stock usually exceeded monthly production, whereas the opposite often occurred in the lower balanoid. No temporal or spatial trends in standing stock were evident. The intertidal distribution of grazing gastropods (excluding littorinids) correlated positively with primary production but showed no relationship with standing stock. No clear seasonal trends in grazer abundance were evident. The fact that standing stock exceeds monthly production suggests that grazing pressure is insufficient to balance primary production in the middle and upper balanoid zones on these shores. Grazers do, however, remove most of the primary production in the lower balanoid zone. Possible mechanisms underlying the observed patterns are discussed.",

Juveniles aggregate inshore, where they school together with juvenile anchovy Engraulis capensis and other pelagic species. Juvenile round herring on the West Coast migrate southwards and, as they grow, gradually occupy deeper water and perform diel vertical migrations. The diet and distribution of round herring overlap extensively with those of the commercially important anchovy and pilchard Sardinops ocellatus populations.

Counts of dolphin schools and numbers were made in a 1 km wide strip-transect flown northwards along the water's edge, and a narrow transect flown southwards 600 m offshore. Three independent tests failed to detect any drop in sighting efficiency across this strip, although the power of the tests was low because of small sample sizes. Count variability between transects was high, probably reflecting movement of dolphins beyond the strip surveyed and failure to sight all the schools within the strip. The average count over a number of transects provides an index of population size for determination of future population trends, but this index was estimated with poor precision. Nevertheless, estimates of average density from the counts indicate that densities of bottlenose dolphins on the Natal South Coast are an order of magnitude less than those off the Natal North Coast and the coast of Transkei. The maximum counts on transects over areas \"preferred\" by bottlenose dolphins provide underestimates of absolute abundance (population censuses) of 433 and 219–249 for the Natal North and Natal South coasts respectively. Low estimates on the Natal South Coast may reflect offshore movements due to water turbidity. If this is not the case, available data on catches of dolphins in shark nets along the Natal coast suggest that present catches probably exceed the level that the South Coast population can sustain, and so would be causing this population to decline. The Natal South Coast should be accorded urgent priority for future studies on the species, and specific recommendations for such studies are made.",

The thermoclines are advectively maintained and as such are dynamically stable, but they do exhibit short-term variations in absolute temperature gradients. There are corresponding variations in subsurface phytoplankton biomass maxima. The water-column phytoplankton production maxima are generally situated in the biomass maxima because these are sufficiently shallow to ensure adequate light. Self-shading becomes a limiting factor with the development of high phytoplankton biomasses. Western Agulhas Bank waters are characterized by deeper thermoclines and less intense subsurface maxima of phytoplankton biomass. Due to the depth of the thermoclines the biomass maxima are generally situated below the depth of the 1-per-cent surface light intensity and, consequently, phytoplankton production is limited. Possible mechanisms for the maintenance of these deep chlorophyll maxima are discussed.",

Into this was integrated potential environmental influences. To determine quantitatively the impact of environmental factors on the spawning process (and ultimately catches), a theoretical methodology was developed based on the use of underwater video images to estimate the rate at which egg pods were deposited. Results from a pilot study undertaken off the Tsitsikamma coast of South Africa demonstrated the viability of this quantitative technique, and while not intended to be a definitive experiment, showed that: (i) an upwelling event was coincident with the formation of a spawning aggregation, supporting the hypothesis that changes in temperature trigger spawning; (ii) biological activities such as egg deposition, predator-induced interruptions in egg deposition, and absence of squid from the egg bed, occupied 19, 22, and 59% of the event time respectively, and (iii) spawning was completed in about 33 h in the absence of female immigration. An overall decline in the deposition rate, combined with the absence of adverse environmental conditions, indicated that spawning was terminated by the ovaries of female squid becoming partially or fully spent, rather than by environmental stimuli. Based on this experience, hardware was then designed and manufactured to realize the methodology, and it is currently being used in a new series of squid spawning experiments.",

Within each of the adult and juvenile sub-groupings, no seasonal differences or size-specific dietary patterns were apparent. Based on algal availability and frequency of occurrence in gut samples, adults selected Ralfsia verrucosa, Ulva spp. and five of the red seaweeds, namely Plocamium corallorhiza, Calliblepharis fimbriata, Spyridia cupressina, Hypnea rosea and Hypnea spicifero. Algae rejected by adults included several coralline species and the spined kelp Ecklonia radiata. Of the six algal types consumed by juveniles, only two were selected, i.e. Ralfsia verrucosa and Corallina sp. Adults exhibited a higher degree of selectivity and their diet generally reflected the most abundant available seaweed. Although the three most available algal types were consumed by juveniles, their level of selectivity was lower than for adults, and many of the available seaweeds were rejected.",

Autotomy of an arm is achieved by breaking off at a predetermined site, or by biting off by the animal itself. Biologically, autotomy is a meaningful behaviour. It is well known, e.g. in male Argonauta during reproduction; it has also been described in several octopod species as a survival strategy. Autophagy, in contrast, is more puzzling; it is distinct from cannibalism because the animals eat (parts of) their own arms. This paper is based on 161 cases of autophagy in Octopus vulgaris. Although the data are still limited, they indicate that autophagy is not caused by hunger or stress, but is an infectious, deadly disease. Incubation time is between one and two weeks; death occurs 1–2 days after autophagy starts. Some data suggest that autophagy is caused either by a (so far unknown) substance released by the animal itself or, more likely, by viruses or bacteria; these, in turn, seem to affect the nervous system. Stress (often thought to be the reason for autophagy) may contribute to it but it is not its primary cause.",

The importance of predation by marine mammals can be evaluated crudely by considering the marine mammal as a rival fishery whose operation is constrained by physiology and energetic requirements, rather than by catch limits and gear restrictions. Evidence collected from grey seals Halichoerus grypus in the United Kingdom, southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina and beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas shows that published information on distribution, based on the location of breeding sites and sightings in shallow water, may give an unrealistic picture of foraging distribution. Studies of diet and distribution can give an impression of the static nature of the inter-action between a marine mammal and the fishery. However, it is the dynamics of the interaction which are important.

    "abstract": "Abstract The diet and predators of Loligo sanpaulensis (Cephalopoda: Loliginidae) on the southern Brazilian shelf were studied by examining the stomach contents of 668 long-finned squid (12–184 mm mantle length) caught by bottom trawl and the stomach contents of 47 potential predators, including stranded penguins and marine mammals as well as fish and cephalopods caught with diverse fishing gears in the region. Of 313 long-finned squid stomachs containing food, fish occurred in 36.4% of stomachs, crustaceans in 23.3% and cephalopods in 6.4%. Identified prey included demersal fish, shrimps and conspecifics. Loligo sanpaulensis was preyed on by 31 of the 47 potential predatory species examined. The frequency of occurrence (FO) was high (>20%) in the stomach contents of La Plata dolphins Pontoporia blainvillei, penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, fur seals Arctocephalus spp., the benthic shark Mustelus canis and the benthic finfish Astroscopus sexpinosus and Percophis brasiliensis. It was less important (5–20% FO) for the benthic and demersal fish Helicolenus lahillei, Paralichthys isosceles, P. patagonicus, Merluccius hubbsi and Urophycis mystacea, and of minor importance (2–5% FO) in the diet of the finfish Trichiurus lepturus, Cynoscion guatucupa, Macrodon ancylodon, Pagrus pagrus and Pomatomus saltatrix. Loligo sanpaulensis seems to be a link in the pelagic and benthic foodwebs of the southern Brazilian shelf, because it is preyed on by such high-level predators as marine mammals and penguins, and by several of the most abundant fish found in the region.",

A stratified sample of 240 anglers was surveyed to determine expenditures. Results showed that, between October 1996 and September 1997, some 8 800 anglers spent around 173 000 days angling and had direct expenditures of N$29.7 million. In all, 93% of angling took place in the West Coast Recreational Area. Some 44% of anglers were foreign visitors who contributed 55% of the expenditures. Value added to gross national income within the shore-angling fishery was N$14 million, equivalent to 3.6% of the value of the whole fisheries sector. The expenditures ultimately amounted (through a multiplier) to a gross national income of N$3 069 per angler, or N$27 million in aggregate. These amounts could be sustainable if policies to reduce fish mortality without affecting angler numbers are implemented.",

Anchovy eggs and larvae were found from October 1995 to February 1996, with most intense spawning from mid-October to early December, Peak abundances of anchovy eggs (717·m−2) and larvae (342·m−2) were encountered during mid-November. Sardine eggs and larvae were found throughout the year, but were most abundant from August 1995 to February 1996. Numbers were greatest during late September, reaching 630 eggs·m−2 and 142 larvae·m−2, with secondary peaks of >200 eggs·m−2 during August, October and January. Spawning products were low from March onwards, but increased slightly during July 1996. Current vectors indicated that spawning prior to December was most favourable for transport of eggs and larvae to the West Coast nursery area. January and February were characterized by increasingly complex flow patterns, while the frontal jet current was positioned offshore of the transect for most of March and April as a result of prolonged periods of upwelling. Monthly length-frequency distributions of larvae indicated spawning by both species farther east on the western Agulhas Bank later in the season, or more complex transport from that region to the sampling area. Mean monthly (August–March) anchovy and sardine (September–February) egg abundances were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with the estimated birthdate distribution of recruits, suggesting that frequent monitoring of egg abundance along the transect may be useful for forecasting recruitment strength.",

It is proposed that, in the southern Benguela during the upwelling season, there is a temperature window from 12 to 15°C when conditions are generally good for diatom population development and chlorophyll concentrations exceed 3 mg·m−3. At lower (<12°C) or higher (>15°C) temperatures, chlorophyll concentrations are <mg·m−3. There is generally a shift in size structure of the phytoplankton population at about 15°C, high biomass, diatom-dominated populations being replaced by low biomass, flagellate-dominated populations. At temperatures between 12 and 15°C when chlorophyll concentrations exceed 3 mg·m−3, the nutritional requirements for egg production by a common herbivorous mesozooplankter will be satisfied. Conversely, at lower (<12°C) or higher (>15°C) temperatures and lower concentrations of chlorophyll, the fecundity of this same mesozooplankter will be reduced severely. These parameters, in conjunction with satellite imagery, may be used to assess minimum potential secondary production of mesozooplankton in South African west coast shelf waters.",

The existence of possible environmental borders for zooplankton populations was explored and discussed in relation to the main hydrographic features of the Benguela upwelling system. Three main boundaries were identified: the shelf-break zone; the area between 19 and 20°S; and the northernmost extension of the Lüderitz upwelling cell (24°30′S). The first boundary separates inshore and shelf species from shelf-break and oceanic species, revealing the boundary between shelf and oceanic circulation. It is reinforced by the strong equatorward and poleward flows that occur over the shelf-break at different depths. The boundary at 19–20°S was related to the general surface, wind-driven flow of the Benguela and its interaction with the Angola Current. Knowledge of the temporal variability associated with this boundary may well be enhanced by monitoring the extension of the proposed indicator species, Euphausia americana and E. gibboides. The turbulent regime associated with the perennial activity of the Lüderitz upwelling cell defines the third main boundary zone. It partially separates inshore species of the northern and southern Benguela and reflects the relative dominance of cross-shelf or alongshore currents.",

Recreational catch information, based on permit sales only, are presented for the 1995/96 fishing season. Permit sales increased by 30% from 1991/92 to 1995/96, with a marked increase in 1992/93. The majority of the recreational permit holders were males (80%) between the ages of 25 and 49 years (68%), who were resident in areas close to the resource. Most of the permit holders (74%) fished throughout the season (as opposed to holidays only), mainly (70%) over weekends. Diving and the use of hoopnets from powered boats were the most popular methods of capture, with shore-based methods and the use of hoopnets from rowing boats of lesser importance. The bulk of the recreational catch was landed within the first three months of the start of the season (by the end of January), which was consistent with the trend in permit sales. The total recreational catch of rock lobster increased from 159 tons in 1991/92 to 469 tons in 1992/93, probably because of an increase in the length of the season and a decrease in the minimum legal size limit, and was estimated at 379 tons for the 1995/96 season. The total recreational catch, as a percentage of the commercial Total Allowable Catch, increased from 7% in 1991/92 to 21% in the 1992/93 season and was estimated at 25% in 1995/96.",

Whichever of these stock-identity hypotheses is selected, the spawner stock size is estimated to be below the harvesting target of 50% of its estimated unexploited size. Assessments conducted for each coast suggest that the West Coast stock is more depleted than that of the South Coast. The results of the analyses are relatively insensitive to a number of variations of the assumptions. The assessments show that the kingklip stock was in all likelihood already depleted below 50% of its pristine level on the West Coast as a result of trawling before the start of the demersal longline fishery. Retrospective analysis indicates that the poor status of the resource would have been evident by 1985 for a West Coast stock, but only by the end of the decade for a South Coast stock.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of remote sensing, it has become clear that the frontal region of eastern boundary current upwelling systems is not smooth and unvarying, but rather has a convoluted, ragged edge consisting of mesoscale plumes, jets and filaments. Such long, narrow, cold, upwelling filaments have been observed to extend seawards of the Benguela frontal system in numerous satellite infra-red images. Recently, cruises have been made to specific filaments in the northern and southern Benguela to sample their physical and biological properties. The data collected have indicated that the features sampled were of the order of 50–100 m deep and more identifiable in their salinity and biological properties than in the temperature fields. Evidence has been found of an Agulhas ring in the South Atlantic Ocean acting as the driving force for an exceptionally long filament in May 1989. Plankton community and size structure and copepod gut fluorescence and rate of egg production were employed to assess the origin and trophic status of water bodies within and on either side of filaments. Complex mixtures of water bodies occur, but large-scale losses of productive coastal water to the oceanic province were not detected. Nitrogen uptake in different size-classes was measured as a function of depth and available light level in filaments off Lüderitz and the Cape Peninsula, and the results are discussed in the context of the thermohaline and biological properties of the filaments. Field studies of cold water filaments have shown that there can be active offshore transport away from the Benguela frontal system. The structure of the filaments appears to be qualitatively different from those reported from the California Current system, especially in the southern Benguela upwelling system, where the possibility of the filaments being forced by passing Agulhas rings has been confirmed.",

Annual bottom trawl surveys conducted in spring provide estimates of the abundance of fish close to the bottom over trawlable grounds. Between 1991 and 1994, hydroacoustic surveys conducted in spring have been used to estimate the pelagic portion of the stock, as well as the portion over untrawlable grounds. These two research datasets, as well as data from purse-seine, mid water and bottom trawl commercial landings, are reviewed to elucidate distribution patterns of horse mackerel and their migratory and spawning strategies. The problems and advantages of bottom trawl and acoustic surveys are discussed in the context of fluctuations in estimates of the size of the stock between 1991 and 1994 and the prevailing environmental conditions. It is concluded that combined acoustic and bottom trawl surveys are the only effective means of surveying horse mackerel, and that effort should be concentrated east of 22°E to assess the spawner stock. It is suggested that research effort directed at improving understanding of exchanges between West Coast (including Namibia) and South Coast population of horse mackerel, as well as of the role of vertical migrations in modulating these exchanges, would be beneficial.",

The new model is based on analyses of outputs of simulation models. These include a size-based micro/mesoplankton model of a Benguela upwelling community and a model of euphausiid grazing. On average, large-celled phytoplankton are responsible for only one-quarter to one-third of total primary production, the remainder occurring by cells <25 μm. Trophic transfers of carbon in the models take place chiefly via one or two steps, after which carbon is lost through respiration and the sinking of faecal material. Trophic efficiencies can be high, generally 40–50 per cent for the first transfer, 15–20 per cent for the second, and 5–10 per cent for remaining transfers. A first attempt is made at linking two models of processes occurring on different scales of time and space. Of the problems encountered, potentially the most difficult to overcome appears to be the manner in which feedbacks can be incorporated from the large to the small scale. C:N ratios of predator and prey are important in determining C:N ratios of faecal material. In a model of a euphausiid population, these ratios vary from 6 to 17 depending on whether animal or plant material respectively is being consumed. This is important in determining rates of carbon export from surface waters through sinking of faecal pellets. The effect of the mesoscale physical environment on plankton distributions and transport needs to be addressed through modelling studies, in order to link planktonic processes to macrozooplankton- and fish-feeding.",

Gonad indices in mature males were highest during December and January and in females during February and March. Mating takes place between January and March. The hepatosomic index of pregnant females was highest at the onset of pregnancy and lowest at parturition. Evidence suggests a two-year reproductive cycle in females, with a gestation period of 13–18 months. The average litter size was nine, with an estimated length at birth of between 50 and 60 cm. Near-term pregnant females were caught mainly in the north, indicating the possibility of a nursery there. Both large and small pregnant females produce pups of the same length, but larger females general1y have larger litters. Regional, seasonal and size variations were evident in the diet, with teleosts being the most frequently eaten prey.",

The fishery only became established in the early 1980s and landings have subsequently stabilized at approximately 800 tons per year, almost one-third of which is a by-catch of trawling operations. The gillnet fishery is centred in St Helena Bay and takes very little by-catch. Both trawl and gillnet operations take place in nursery areas of C. capensi and some species of true shark. C. capensi occurs widely off the southern African coast, from 1 to 366 m deep, but large numbers are only caught inshore (<50 m), the only area where immature fish are found. The fork length at 50% sexual maturity is 435 mm in males (3,3 years) and 496 mm in females (4,2 years). Mature fish have an annual onshore/offshore migration, most mature fish aggregating inshore in summer to breed and lay eggs. They then disperse to deep water where unlaid eggs are resorbed and energy reserves accumulated. The largest number of viable eggs recorded was 22. C. capensi primarily live over soft substrata and their diet consists principally of 1 invertebrates associated with such substrata. The relatively fast growth, early sexual maturity and reasonably high fecundity of the species make it a safer fisheries target than most other chondrichthyans.",

On the basis of migratory patterns determined from tagging and catch data, and on differences in growth rate and size-at-maturity, it is concluded that these areas of abundance represent four separate stocks. Each stock apparently disperses offshore in winter (to c. 130 m depth) and concentrates inshore (<60 m depth) in response to ocean ographic patterns during summer. Growth rate and size-at-50% maturity (L 50) increased clinally from the South-Eastern Cape through to the South-Western Cape, and in all three regions males matured at larger size than females. Sizes at maturity for male and female R. globiceps were respectively 18.6 and 15.3 cm (fork length, FL) in the South-Eastern Cape, 22.1 and 18.1 cm in the Southern Cape and 24.3 and 23.6 cm in the South-Western Cape. The fitted Von Bertalanffy growth equations for the three regions were: Lt = 349 (1−e−0.114(t+3.60)) mm for the South-Eastern Cape; Lt = 337 (1−e−0.207(t+1.05)) mm for the Southern Cape; and Lt = 379 (1−e−0.290(t+0.16)) mm for the South-Western Cape. Maximum ages recorded in each region were 21 years for the South-Western Cape, 20 years for the Southern Cape and 10 years for the South-Eastern Cape. Lack of older fish in the South-Eastern Cape sample, attributed to inadequate sample size, has probably resulted in overestimates of both L ∞ and K in this region. Spawning is from August to February, with a peak in spring (September–November). Early juvenile R. globiceps recruit into estuarine and surf-zone marine nursery areas at around 2–5cm (±3 months), but move progressively farther offshore with growth; those trawled deeper than 50 m east of Cape Agulhas were predominantly adults (20–35 cm FL). Because of cooler water temperatures west of Cape Agulhas, adults there are found from the surf zone to depths of only 20 m in summer.",

Analysis of dolphin catches in the nets indicated that they are caught at random along the coast, although there was an association between catch and sighting rates. Mean water clarity at each beach was not correlated with either sighting or capture rates at the same beach for the period 1984–1988.

    "abstract": "Abstract Monthly monitoring in 1975 of the hydrology of the south-western coast of South Africa revealed a strong seasonal cycle, with both upwelling and stratification most intense in summer and almost uniform conditions in winter. Uplift of cool, low-salinity Central Water (with typical t = 12°C, s = 35,0 × 10−3) to within 20–40 m of the surface occurred from January to April and from September to November, months in which SE winds were dominant. However, this water was observed to have upwelled to the surface only between February and April, and in winter it remained beneath 80 m. The upwelling response to wind was apparently not as rapid as off the Cape Peninsula to the west. Stratification was best developed offshore in summer, largely because of the uplift of cooler Central Water and the onshore advection of a layer of Subtropical Surface Water and Agulhas Bank water with salinities > 35,3 × 10−3. These conditions were concurrent with a subsurface front from Danger Point to Cape Point. This front, which would enhance westward flow at the surface, was on occasion modified by upwelling west of Danger Point and Cape Hangklip and by upwelling eddies in Sandown Bay and Walker Bay. Inorganic nutrients upwelled with the Central Water in spring and summer, but generally did not penetrate through the thermocline into the warmer, more-saline and nutrient-poor surface layer. In late autumn and winter, strong NW winds caused vigorous vertical mixing to 60–80 m deep, and nutrient concentrations in the upper layer increased. On the upper shelf maximum nutrient concentrations occurred from January to April, whereas on the lower shelf they occurred in April and May. These maxima were both largely concurrent with oxygen values of less than 3,5 mℓ·ℓ−1. Nutrient regeneration was indicated on the upper shelf, but on the lower shelf there was evidence of a continuation of the oxygen-poor undercurrent from the West Coast at a depth of 120–150 m. Very low oxygen content and associated nitrate-reduction were not encountered, probably owing to the limitations on the productivity of the region, and to the substantial vertical mixing in winter.",

Cpue, too, has decreased in recent years. The current size at first entry to the fishery is below that at which females mature, a situation which could lead to overfishing of the spawner stock.

Shifts in the locality of peak spawning of anchovy often coincided with that of pilchard, although sometimes anchovy were slower to respond to an environmental change. With negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies spawning shifted northwards, whereas with positive anomalies spawning took place both in the north and farther south. With a transition from negative SST anomalies early in the spawning season to zero or positive anomalies later in the spawning season, the impact on anchovy and pilchard spawning differed. Anchovy spawning was either reduced or absent during the negative phase of transitional seasons, thus avoiding unfavourable conditions. Pilchard, on the other hand, were spawning mainly in the north during the negative phase of the transitional seasons, but also in the south during the zero to positive phase. The shifts in spawning locality in response to environmental anomalies outside the spawning area imply that explanations for such shifts need not be sought in changes in biomass or age structure or in the fact that stocks may be genetically different, all theories previously advanced.",

In terms of carbon, different components of the phytoplankton were found to be associated with different stages of the upwelling circulation. The variation and peaks in the biomass were primarily attributable to the diatom fraction of the total carbon, with the microflagellates and dinoflagellates maintaining a relatively stable background level. Phytoplankton carbon: chlorophyll a ratios exhibited a coherent spatial pattern. Chlorophyll a values from different locations and depths were therefore not a comparable index of biomass.

The model is based on the assumption that equal biomasses occur in logarithmically equal size classes in the pelagic marine environment. Phytoplankton, with an equivalent spherical diameter ranging from 1 to 128 μm, occupy 21 size classes on the logarithmic scale. Two different size ranges are assumed for some commercial, pelagic fish species, equivalent to exploitation with two different purse-seine mesh sizes. A mesh of 12,7 mm would catch 8 size classes of pilchard, horse mackerel and anchovy whereas a mesh of 32 mm would catch only 3,3 size classes of pilchard and horse mackerel. From the model, the potential biomass of these commercial pelagic fish is estimated, after allowing for the presence of other commercial and non-commercial fish and other taxa in the exploited size range. Total pelagic fish production is estimated by assuming constant turnover rates of 1·y−1 and 1,5·y−1 when exploited with 32 and 12,7 mm mesh nets respectively. Consideration of the maximum and mean reported catches in the exploited areas indicates that only some 25 per cent of pelagic fish production is exploitable by man. On this basis, the unexploited Agulhas Bank region may yield some 400 000 metric tons (wet) of pelagic fish of the species considered, and the East Coast region some 90 000 tons. Exploitation in these regions cannot be recommended, because the Agulhas Bank is an important spawning ground for many pelagic species, and the fish in both regions probably act as a reserve buffer for the heavily exploited pelagic resource of the Western Cape.",

Adult fish are more selective, taking larger prey such as crinoids, cephalopods and crustaceans, and they can crush prey. Comparisons between roman and other co-occurring juvenile sparids indicate considerable dietary overlap.",

The samplers compared were a vertically towed WP.2 net (200 μm mesh), a double obliquely towed Bongo net (300 and 500 μm mesh), a horizontally towed Miller net (300 μm mesh) and a 7,6-cm diameter centrifugal pump (200 μm mesh). The variability in the biomass and the size and numbers of seven copepod taxa and one euphausiid species were examined in respect of avoidance, mesh size and mode of fishing. There was no evidence of avoidance of any sampler by either the cope pods or euphausiid larvae. Avoidance appeared to be partly responsible for the lower catches of juvenile and adult euphausiids by the WP.2 net and the pump when compared with the catches of the Miller and Bongo nets. Despite their different modes of sampling, the Miller and Bongo nets caught similar numbers and size ranges of juvenile and adult euphausiids. Total retention only occurred if the width of the copepods was considerably larger than the mesh width. Factors to correct for mesh selectivity are given and their limitations discussed.",

Follicular atresia lowers the number of maturing and mature eggs in the ovary, so previous fecundity estimates for cephalopods may have been too high. To correct potential fecundity estimates for losses arising from atresia, it is necessary to estimate the duration of each atresia stage in relation to the total spawning period.",

Fish larvae were collected from a sample site adjacent to a rocky reef within the estuary, 200 m upstream from the mouth, on six occasions between January 1988 and March 1989. A total of 2 418 fish larvae, representing 60 families and 154 taxa, was collected. The catch was dominated by the families Myctophidae (13,8%), Gobiidae (10,1%), Tripterygiidae (8,2%), Engraulidae (6,4%), Blenniidae (4,7%), Labridae (4,4%), Pempheridae (4,4%), Apogonidae (3,7%), Sparidae (3,6%) and Schindleriidae (2,6%). The most abundant larval species were the engraulid Stolephorus holodon and the tripterygiid Euneapterygius clarkae. The larval assemblage in the estuary reflected the nearshore coral reef fish community and was determined by oceanic and tidal conditions. Larval densities were significantly greater (p < 0,05) on flood tides than on ebb tides. Most larvae (50%) were reef-associated, estuarine-associated species contributing 28% of the total taxa. The presence of oceanic taxa, in particular myctophids, was attributed to shoreward intrusions of Agulhas Current surface water. The Kosi Estuary possibly plays an important role as a retention area and the associated reef functions as a settlement site for recruiting reef fish.",

Previous work suggested that anchovy spawn on the western Agulhas Bank in temperatures between 16 and 19°C, where they feed predominantly on copepods. This study shows that the western Bank is a more suitable spawning area for anchovy, having greater thermal stability, a larger area of 16–19°C water and a more consistent food environment than off the South-Western Cape. Also, copepod production on the western Bank was highest in 16–19°C water. To identify factors controlling the area of this water mass, a cluster analysis was used on a suite of hydrographic variables. Three periods were identified: winter (August-September), spring (October-December) and summer (January-March), reflecting changes in the extent of the 16–19°C water and anchovy spawning, both of which peaked during spring. Spring was further characterized by infrequent surface upwelling. During summer, upwelling frequently reached the surface and the upwelling front migrated offshore, constricting the area of 16–19°C water. It is hypothesized that spawning success in anchovy is dependent upon the extent of suitable spawning habitat, both spatially (l6–19°C water) and temporally (spring). To put this concept into a predictive framework, the number of anchovy eggs was regressed against the area of 16–19°C water; a significant, positive relationship (p < 0.001, r 2 = 0.56, n = 17) was found. An implication of the hypothesis is that the duration of spawning may be important to recruitment.",

Fish (mainly pelagic) were infrequent < 10%) in the diet of fish from both coasts. The feeding periodicity, rate of gut evacuation and vertical migration of horse mackerel were investigated from midwater and bottom trawl collections taken during five diel sampling periods between 1993 and 1995 at fixed positions on the South Coast. Horse mackerel feed only during the day, mostly in late afternoon prior to their ascent into midwater at around sunset. Based on the exponential rate of decline in stomach fullness throughout the night, the rate of gut evacuation by horse mackerel was estimated to be 0.22·h−1. Using the Elliott and Persson method, the daily ration was estimated as 3.8% of wet body mass. Horse mackerel appear to migrate vertically for reasons other than feeding, and selective advantages of this behaviour are discussed.",

The crucial data required are those on species distribution (preferably on distribution of species concentrations) and on the basic life cycle itself. The survival strategy of cephalopods is spatially orientated (i.e. how and to what extent individuals are distributed is directly linked to the success or failure of the next generation). The use of basic life-cycle parameters in management application is emphasized, and comparisons in this regard are drawn with the management of teleost stocks.",

No single explanation can be used to account for these results, and it is suggested that they are the product of differences in gill-raker morphology, feeding behaviour and within-shoal position.

Three squid groups were detected through study of the distributional area, size, maturity stage, age and hatching month. North of 41°S, there were immature individuals of 14–21 cm mantle length (ML) that had hatched mostly in June. Small mature, spawning and spent squid (males 14–22 cm ML, females 18–26 cm ML) were found on the inner and intermediate shelf between 40°30′ and 46°30′S. They had hatched from January to April, with a clear peak in March. South of 45°S, males of 17–25 cm ML and females of 17–29 cm ML were found over the intermediate and outer shelf; most males were mature whereas the majority of the females were immature. They had hatched from May to July, with a peak in June. The relationship between statolith increment and size showed that the growth rates of the later-hatched individuals were faster than those of individuals hatched earlier.

Prey selection varied intraspecifically with growth. There was considerable overlap in prey taken by different predators, although the dominant food differed between the two coasts and according to habitat (soft substrata or hard reefs). Prey selection varied with depth, probably as a result of the influence of depth and other physical features on prey species distribution. Small crustaceans were taken by all the predators and constituted the single most important group, especially for small predators. Brachyurans were important as prey, particularly in those species inhabiting hard substrata. Fish were of minor importance as food, except in Chelidonichthys capensis, Malacocephalus laevis and Helicolenus dactylopterus. Commercially important species of fish and cephalopods were preyed on only occasionally. It appeared that prey were selected according to their abundance, size, behaviour and habitat use. The use of benthic and epibenthic prey constitutes an important pathway for energy to return from the benthos to the foodweb.",

Sampling results in an increase in the number of circulating haemocytes per mℓ and in the percentage of haemocytes containing cytoplasmic granules, and a change in the staining pattern of the haemocytes. It also causes a decrease in the quantity of copper in the haemolymph. The haemocytes phagocytose bacteria (Vibrio anguillarum) in vitro in the absence of haemolymph, but there is enhanced phagocytosis in the presence of haemolymph. Haemocytes migrate towards low concentrations of various blood preparations, to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to preparations that had contained live bacteria. They also have an apparent bacteriostatic effect on the growth of live bacteria. Haemocytes produce intracellular reactive oxygen species after incubation with dead bacteria in particular, but also live bacteria and LPS. E. cirrhosa haemolymph agglutinates the bacteria V. anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas salmonicida and exerts a bacteriostatic effect on them. The haemolymph, haemocytes and certain tissues from E. cirrhosa exhibit lysozyme and antiprotease activity. Injection of live V. anguillarum causes an increase in lysozyme activity in the branchial heart (after 48 h) and a decrease in the number of circulating haemocytes (after 24 h). Antiprotease activity increases in the haemocytes (4 h) after injection of bacteria but decreases in the haemolymph. Live bacteria cause an increase in the number of circulating haemocytes, but are cleared from the circulation in about 4 h by both the haemocytes and tissues (branchial heart, branchial heart appendage and white body), where they are degraded. Ultrastructural changes were observed in the branchial heart cells and the haemocyte nucleus after injection of bacteria. Following injection, colloidal graphite is aggregated in blood vessels only.",

There was considerable overlap in type of prey taken, particularly by the smaller specimens from a specific area. Locality had a profound effect on predation because of its influence on prey availability. Swarming crustaceans, especially euphausiids and mysids, constituted the bulk of the prey of all the smaller fish. Larger prey, notably fish and cephalopods.were favoured by the bigger predators, particularly adult Lepidopus caudatus and Zeus capensis, although the species selected varied according to locality. Abundance and availability of prey of suitable size and exhibiting appropriate behaviour appeared to be critical factors in prey choice. Commercially important species were taken mainly by the larger fish analysed and were chiefly hake, clupeoids and squid. In all cases, the feeding adaptations exhibited by the predators were indicative of the prey taken, despite there being wide variations in body morphology between the species.",

    "abstract": "Pelagic fish catch statistics are used as surrogates to evaluate the potential fish productivity in upwelling ecosystems. A comparison between 10 upwelling areas of the world shows that the Peruvian ecosystem is three- to ten-fold more productive than the others. The size of the ecosystem, estimated by the surface of the continental shelf, does not by itself explain the observed disparity. Upwelling systems are characterized by different combinations of two different environmental variables: the upwelling intensity and the mixing generated by the wind. Using generalized additive models, an exploratory analysis is performed in order to identify the environmental conditions that maximize the total pelagic fish catch productivity (mainly sardine, sardinella and anchovy). The analyses consider fish catch as the dependent variable and the two environmental factors as the independent variables. Optimal environmental conditions appear to be a combination of: a high upwelling index (∼ 1.2 m3·s−1m−1) and moderate wind-mixing (∼250 m3·sm−3). The Peruvian ecosystem is the only upwelling system that has these characteristics, making it unique and singularly productive. These empirical results stress the importance of considering a combination of environmental factors when explaining pelagic fish productivity in upwelling systems.",

Differences among basic biological parameters of the population (e.g. length frequency) indicate that jigging is a more selective, and therefore biased, method of sampling than midwater trawling or purse-seining. This has important consequences for stock assessments that take commercial catches into account. The selectivity curve indicates that squid of mantle lengths (ML) 28–33 cm are over-represented (in terms of the situation in the population) in fisheries conducted by jigging and that squid <26 and >34 cm ML are under-represented if purse-seine results are considered to be representative of the population.",

The contributions of the different species in the catches varied seasonally and annually. Clear unimodal seasonal trends in catch rates were evident for most species, although catches of D. sargus and U. canariensis were bimodal. There were no consistent trends in the mean mass of any individual species. Catch rates of the six most abundant species, and all species combined, showed considerable long-term variation. The marked improvements in the catch per unit effort (cpue) of D. sargus and A. hololepidotus after 1985 could not be attributed to the restrictions imposed in that year. Cpue of L. lithognathus declined consistently after 1975 and was unaffected by the restrictions. A moderate but sustained improvement in the cpue of D. capensis, which corresponds with the predicted beneficial effects of catch restrictions, indicates that the current legislation may be effective for this species. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the restrictions should be enhanced by further research and improved enforcement.",

Cyclic variations in the annual yields of seabird products evident at decadal long time-scales may reflect fluctuations in prey populations at similar periods. However, no such relationship has been demonstrated and consequently the value of such annual yields as indicators is not proved. More recently, interannual variation in diets, foraging effort, breeding success and chick growth of two of the three most abundant species of seabird in the ecosystem have been examined in relation to changes in prey abundance. Although the relative abundance of important forage species in the diets of both species of seabird have reflected regional changes in the absolute abundance of these prey, changes in the values of other parameters thought to reflect food availability were not consistently correlated between and within species. This indicates poor potential for their use as indicators of change at least over the range of abundances experienced in this study. Under present management protocol, data from seabirds do not nor are likely to provide abundance indices that may be used directly in stock assessment of commercially important species. To date, insights into distribution and migration of pelagic fish provided by seabird-derived data probably represent the most valuable contribution of birds to fisheries scientists studying the Benguela system.",

Growth of the colony slowed in 1995 and 1996 and reversed in 1998, coinciding with periods of low abundance of Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis off South Africa. In December 1996, penguins were excluded from a portion of land where they had formerly bred. They responded by increasing the density of their nests in other areas and expanding their area of breeding longshore. These patterns indicate that food and not space are currently controlling colony growth rate. Much of the colony growth probably results from immigration of first-time breeders from other colonies. Of immigrants, 70–80% may be from Dyer Island to the south-east, where numbers of penguins have decreased. Boulders also is frequently visited by penguins from other colonies, and by rehabilitated birds.",

The pelagic community of the South African west coast is dominated by clupeiform fish, which are the principal prey of snoek, the dominant piscivorous teleost in the area, and other fish, including tuna and pelagic sharks. Keystone prey species are broadly similar on the South African south and west coasts, but predator composition differs. Studies of rocky reef fish suggest that the fauna of the South Coast is more diverse than that of the West, the West Coast having fewer species and only two reef fish species being taken in linefisheries. Feeding interactions of some of the dominant species have been established, but the status of commercially less important fish such as elasmobranchs and small species is poorly known. The community and feeding interactions of fish living over soft substrata are better known and part of this fauna is taken by demersal trawlers. The two species of Cape hake dominate the communities on both coasts, but the fauna is more diverse on the Cape south coast. Generally, much of the present ichthyological knowledge is derived from the ecologically narrow perspective of commercial fisheries. Nevertheless, the patterns of diversity appear to conform to previous work, which has indicated a lower species diversity in the Atlantic than in the Indian Ocean. Knowledge of commercially unimportant fish is fragmentary, and understanding of the ecological interactions on the South Coast generally lags that of the West.",

There were significant correlations (p < 0,05) between the abundance of pilchard in gannet diet at Lambert's Bay and Malgas Island combined, and the total catch and CPUE at annual, though not monthly, time-scales. Trends in levels of correlation are discussed in relation to short-term variability, sampling intensity, statistical chance and the distribution of pilchard. Gannet diet and commercial catches reflect regional, but not local, changes in biomass. The 1983 pilchard year-class was relatively strong. Gannet diet is suggested to be a reliable monitor of the trend in pilchard biomass at low pilchard biomasses, a time at which direct surveys are least reliable.",

Freezing is apparently a viable method for preserving samples destined for analysis of nitrate and low silicate (<30–40 mmol·m−3), but phosphate samples are seemingly not well preserved when frozen. In the latter case, the deficits between analysis of fresh samples aboard ship and frozen duplicates ashore vary randomly. To determine normal trends in nutrient distribution it seems feasible to store samples in the frozen state, but for highly accurate work, as would be necessary for WOCE studies, it is advisable to analyse samples at sea immediately after collection.",

Information on water level, temperature, salinity and currents was collected. Estimates of dimensionless Reynolds and Richardson numbers indicate a three-layered structure. Apart from periodic localized turbulence near the mouth, inter-layer exchange occurred by extensive entrainment. Flushing times of the order of 12 hours, 2 days and 2 weeks were found for the surface, intermediate and bottom layers respectively. Extreme spring tides during the dry season (volume flow in excess of 20 m3·s−1 during flood) may allow the system to degenerate into a single saline layer partially covered by a very thin layer of freshwater. Extreme river flow during the wet season (volume flow in excess of 100 m3·s−1) may flush the estuary so that it only contains pure freshwater. It is suggested that five \"fluvial-marine\" states may be identified: very dry, dry, dry-wet, wet, very wet. The Palmiet functions as a highly stratified fjord-type system under average conditions but, owing to its limited capacity relative to the potential fluxes of water, the stratification pattern can change dramatically.",

Seven cartilaginous species were caught, of which Mustelus mustelus (16,6 g·h−1) was the most important. Sharks were either discarded or returned to the sea. Catches of most species were seasonal, a result of both availability of fish and targeting of angler effort.

Results from 27 birds engaged in chick rearing showed that the mean maximum dive depth was 33.9 ± 2.6 m, with a deepest dive of 74 m. A large flock of non-breeding guanay cormorants (about 140 000 birds) foraged only during daylight, with modal departure and arrival times of 09:00 and 16:00 respectively. Arrival times were more variable than departure times. Cormorants flew almost exclusively parallel to the coast (92% of cases), with feeding frenzies observed mainly within 1–3 km of the coast. Duration of foraging trips averaged 6.2 h (CV = 34%), and increased significantly throughout the season. There were interannual differences in diet composition, but generally Peruvian silverside Odonthestes regia regia, Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens and mote sculpin Normanichthys crockeri were the main food delivered to cormorant chicks, accounting for 45, 29 and 16% of the overall number of items respectively. Maximum dive depths suggest that guanay cormorants not only feed just below the surface, but that they can also exploit much of the water column. Short-term variations in the timing and duration of foraging trips of guanay cormorants probably reflect the unpredictable and patchy distribution of their main prey.",

However, Loligo vulgaris cpue was clearly seasonal, with a distinct peak in November and an evident decline from winter to spring. Temperature, rainfall and local wind records were used in making a preliminary investigation into meteorological factors that may affect beach-seine catches of squid. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that temperature is a highly significant explanatory variable for cpue variation, whereas the intensity of the wind plays an important role, but mostly during winter. Rainfall was significantly related to variation in cpue in one zone. Cpue was generally negatively correlated with air temperature and rainfall. Most significant correlations of cpue with wind were also negative.",

Relative abundance (cpue) series up to 1993 from the Republic of China, Japan and South Africa are used in the model-fitting process. Coefficients of variation and confidence intervals for the estimates are obtained using the (conditioned) parametric bootstrap and the percentile methods respectively. The sensitivity of the results to violation of some of the assumptions made by the model, changes to the values of its input parameters, and changes to the abundance series used in the model-fitting process are examined. The results of the age-structured production model are contrasted with those of an age-aggregated observation-error estimator and those of a Bayesian estimator which allows also for fluctuations in recruitment. The resource was estimated to be markedly depleted — to probably slightly above 20% of its pre-exploitation level expressed in terms of exploitable biomass — and to have an annual maximum sustainable yield of slightly less than 25 000 tons. Qualitatively, the results are insensitive to the changes examined. Risk analyses are carried out for a variety of future harvesting strategies. These suggest that recent average annual catches of almost 29 000 tons need to be reduced to below 25 000 tons to prevent continued depletion of the resource. It appears that there would be almost no benefit from the introduction of a minimum size in the fishery. Careful monitoring of the situation is required to allow refinement of these estimates with time, and to check the effectiveness of any management action taken.",

Two larger juvenile specimens have now been obtained, one collected near the surface in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the other rehydrated from a dried specimen originally recovered from the stomach of an Alepisaurus. A photograph of the latter specimen before dehydration was found among the unpublished notes of S. S. Berry. The squid are characterized by very large fins that dwarf the rest of the animal. The fins are terminal in position, mostly posterior to the mantle muscle. The tentacles are similar to the arms in general form, but are much more robust. Tentacle suckers are in eight series, whereas the crowded arm suckers constitute more than two series on some arm pairs. The distal portions of the arms and tentacles taper abruptly to thin vermiform filaments. The funnel cartilage of the net-collected juvenile is oval and the buccal connectives to Arms IV are ventral. Although some characters indicate a likely relationship with the chiroteuthid/mastigoteuthid group of families, the brachial crown differs from that found in any known family. Based upon these three specimens and the photograph, it is concluded that the squid represent a family not previously recognized by science. This family is named Magnapinnidae, with the type species Magnapinna pacifica n. gen., n. sp., the holotype of which is the net-collected juvenile. Although all three specimens are included in the family and genus, the possibility exists that the paralarva and the rehydrated specimen are not conspecific with the holotype. Therefore, paratypes are not designated.",

The population increase in the past 10 years was too fast to be explained solely by breeding production; immigration also may have been involved. Increased number of coastal water bodies, some stocked with introduced fish, availability of agricultural offal, and lack of disturbance at the breeding site on Dassen Island likely contributed to the population increase. Dassen Island and a number of the coastal water bodies where pelicans roost and forage in the Western Cape are now proclaimed nature reserves. It is suggested that the few important water bodies not yet afforded legal protection should also be proclaimed. Research is needed on the role of offal in the diet and to show whether there has been immigration of pelicans from areas outside the Western Cape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The South African abalone Haliotis midae resource is widely perceived as being under threat of over-exploitation as a result of increased poaching. In this paper, reservations are expressed about using catch per unit effort as the sole index of abundance when assessing this fishery, particularly because of the highly aggregatory behaviour of the species. A fishery-independent survey has been initiated and is designed to provide relative indices of abundance with CVs of about 25% in most of the zones for which Total Allowable Catchs (TACs) are set annually for this fishery. However, it will take several years before this relative index matures to a time-series long enough to provide a usable basis for management. Through a series of simple simulation models, it is shown that calibration of the survey to provide values of biomass in absolute terms would greatly enhance the value of the dataset. The models show that, if sufficient precision (CV 50% or less) could bc achieved in such a calibration exercise, the potential for management benefit is improved substantially, even when using a relatively simple management procedure to set TACs. This improvement results from an enhanced ability to detect resource declines or increases at an early stage, as well as from decreasing the time period until the survey index becomes useful. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that basic modelling techniques could usefully indicate which forms of adaptive management experiments would improve ability to manage the resource, mainly through estimation of the level of precision that would be required from those experiments. The results of this study are particularly applicable to fishing zones for which there are insufficient other data to perform a standard stock assessment.",

Dogfish are relatively slow-growing and long-lived. The maximum ages observed were 29 years for males and 32 years for females. Growth was best described by the Von Bertalanffy growth model and a significant difference in the growth rates for each gender was demonstrated. Females attained larger sizes (largest aged was 782 mm TL; L ∞ = 932.145 mm, K = 0.0328) than the males (largest aged was 572 mm TL; L ∞ = 525.878, K = 0.0893). Males attained 50% maturity at about 9 years of age (400 mm TL) and females at approximately 15 years (490 mm TL). Estimates suggest a high biomass of S. megalops on the Agulhas Bank, possibly making it appropriate for exploitation. However, its life-history characteristics necessitate a cautious management approach should it become a target species, particularly because it is already taken as a bycatch of the trawlfishery. A feasibility study of age validation showed that oxytetracycline was absorbed by the dorsal fin spine of captive specimens, although laboratory conditions were inadequate to maintain this species over a prolonged period.",

In all, 8 797 fish larvae, representing 144 species and 64 families were collected. The Clupeidae and Gobiidae were the dominant families, representing 30 and 15% of the total catch respectively. The most abundant larvae were the blueline herring Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus, which contributed 29.7% of the total catch. Larvae of estuarine-independent species dominated the total catch, both in terms of density (78%) and number of species (81%). In all, 28 species dependent on estuaries at some stage in their life cycle were recorded; of these 13 were species totally dependent on estuaries. Temperature and salinity accounted for 31% of the variation in larval densities of estuarine-dependent species. Turbidity was a significant variable for estuarine-independent species, larval densities of the abundant species being negatively correlated to turbidity. Larval density peaked mainly in August 1992 (winter), with a mean larval density of 118 larvae·100m−3. Larvae of estuarine-associated species were mainly at the flexion and postflexion developmental stages, whereas most larvae of estuarine-independent species were at preflexion and flexion stages. Larval densities of certain estuarine-associated species (e.g. Argyrosomus sp.) were significantly higher in bottom samples, mainly on flood tides but also on ebb tides, suggesting that selective tidal stream transport is a recruitment mechanism used by these species. The impact of harbour development is shown by the dominant marine component of the larval fish assemblage in the harbour. However, despite the seminatural estuarine environment of Durban Harbour, the high species diversity of fish larvae in the system indicates that the harbour is in a relatively good ecological condition.",

Recruitment is therefore assumed to be equal to the observed median. This TAC may be revised in May or June, after the actual recruitment has been estimated. This procedure incorporates a risk that, if recruitment is below the median, the stock could be adversely depleted before the mid-year recruitment survey. A simulation approach is used in this paper to assess the possible benefits, in terms of average annual catch and interannual fluctuations in catch, of three different methods of predicting recruitment earlier in the season, if such methods were available. The results show that the average annual catch could be increased theoretically by up to 48 per cent if a very precise prediction (CV = 0,1) could be made at the start of the fishing season. In practice, more modest improvements of 21 per cent by prerecruit surveys undertaken in March each year, or 16 per cent by means of a two-class ordinal prediction with 70 per cent success, may be attainable. However, these improvements would result in increased interannual fluctuations in catch, a situation which may be detrimental to the fishing industry.",

Behavioural patterns observed in the absence of fishing continued in the presence of large numbers of jigs in the water column, although the behaviour of individuals and paired squid occasionally altered in the immediate vicinity of the jigs. Squid reacted to the jigs in three ways, approaching them rapidly and grabbing them in their arms, approaching with caution and using the tentacles to touch them, or on occasion ignoring the jigs completely. Spawning at night continued in the presence of lights. At times lights attracted squid around the vessel, and on other occasions squid moved away from the area at dusk, returning at daybreak. Anchors and anchor chains did minimal damage to the egg beds during the study period, only 0.08% of the eggs located within 2 m of either side of the anchors and chains being damaged. Distribution of egg mops within a spawning site appeared to differ according to substratum type and not fishing pressure. Noise from large numbers (>24) of fishing vessels jigging in water 18 m deep had no discernible effect on spawning behaviour, although the presence of fishing vessels over a spawning site where egg beds were not yet established may have resulted in termination of spawning activity.",

    "abstract": "A proposal is made to classify the pools of biogenic carbon in the oceans by reference to their turnover times. Break points in the continuum of turnover times, located at 10−2 and 102 years, distinguish between short-lived organic carbon, long-lived organic carbon and sequestered biogenic carbon. The three pools of biogenic carbon are discussed by reference to the more usual oceanographic concepts of new v. regenerated production, and export v. recycled production. Short-lived organic carbon is mainly associated with the microbial food-loop, long-lived organic carbon is relevant to renewable marine resources, and sequestered carbon is pertinent to global climate change (greenhouse effect). Recycling, export and sequestration are controlled by the proportions of primary production effected by small (<5 μm) and large (>5 μm) phytoplankton respectively, and by the selective grazing pressure experienced by cells in the various size-classes. These ecosystem processes are in turn governed by hydrodynamics. At low levels of auxiliary (mechanical) energy, the physical environment is stable, so that pelagic ecosystems are dominated by the microbial food-loop and biogenic carbon is mainly short-lived. Transitions from high levels of auxiliary energy to more stable conditions favour the production of large phytoplankton. When this takes place along predictable regular modes, primary production may be channelled into the long-lived pool, whereas stochastic transitions may lead to carbon sequestration. This theoretical framework may help the modern approaches of fisheries oceanography and biogeochemical oceanography to converge.",

Two entirely different methods of valuation, the travel cost method and contingent valuation, were applied. Results for the two methods indicate convergent validation. On aggregate, anglers spent between N$23 million and N$31 million on angling trips in Namibia during 1998, and they were willing to pay between N$24 million and N$27 million more than this for the experience. The fishery contributed between N$11 million and N$15 million to gross national income. Anglers in the fishery were found willing to pay some N$1 million annually towards conservation of the fish resource, as well as some N$340 000 annually for licences. Demand for angling experiences is generally price inelastic, suggesting that rents might be captured through donations and licence fees, without reducing angler numbers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Total catch and effort for the inshore net-fisheries in the Western Cape, South Africa, were estimated by means of face-to-face questionnaire, telephone and access point surveys, analysis of factory records and compulsory catch returns. In most areas, gillnet fishing effort was confined to summer, with highest average catch per unit effort during months of low effort. Records of monofilament gillnet sales show that approximately 180 illegal nets are sold annually (20% of all sales). During the period 1994–1999, only 26 illegal mesh size nets were confiscated annually (14% of those sold) on average, indicating that few illegal fishers are apprehended. Beach-seine fishers appeared to operate opportunistically throughout the year along the West Coast, whereas South-West Coast permit-holders concentrate their activity during summer. Sources of survey error in effort and catch-rate estimation are discussed. Approximately 25 000 gillnet days and 3 200 beach-seine hauls made annually land around 6 000 tons of fish, substantially more than the mean annual reported catch of 1 369 tons. Comparison of observed or documented catches with compulsory catch returns confirmed that as little as 21% of the actual effort and only 8%of the fish caught are reported. Despite the fact that catches are much greater than those reported, the lowercatch rates, smaller average size of fish caught and historical and anecdotal evidence suggest that the harder Liza richardsonii stock is regionally over exploited in areas with high fishing effort. It is concluded that the inshore net fishery in the Western Cape is oversubscribed in most regions and a reduction in latent and \"recreational\" effort is therefore recommended. A suitable reduction in total effort may allow the L. richardsonii stock to recover, reduce the ecosystem effects of the fishery by reducing the amount of bycatch and improve catch rates for bona fide commercial fishers. It would also facilitate improved monitoring and policing of the fishery and hopefully improve compliance with regulations.

    "abstract": "During the 1980s, there was a major shift in the understanding of the structure of marine foodwebs. As a result, the microbial loop has been incorporated into the classical concept of the planktonic food chain. Heterotrophic bacteria and Protozoa have been shown to be important components of the plankton biomass in many parts of the world's oceans, and their role in the trophic dynamics of pelagic foodwebs has been studied intensively. In the southern Benguela, field, laboratory and modelling studies have been combined to calculate carbon and nitrogen fluxes through the microheterotrophic portion of the pelagic foodweb. A size-based simulation model incorporating recent hypotheses on the structure and functioning of the pelagic foodweb after upwelling predicts rapid growth of a phytoplankton community dominated by netphytoplankton and chain-forming nanophytoplankton cells. After nitrate-depletion the bloom declines, to be followed by a bloom of single nanophytoplankton cells dependent upon regenerated nitrogen. During conditions of high nitrate availability and a netphytoplankton-dominated community, mesozooplankton ingest 44 per cent of the total primary production through herbivory and 1,4 per cent through carnivory. During periods of low nitrate availability and a nanophytoplankton-dominated community, mesozooplankton ingest 0,6 per cent of the total primary production through herbivory and 5 per cent through carnivory. Food chains are longer and microheterotrophs are an important link between primary producers and the larger heterotrophs. Simulation results show that microheterotrophs are an important component of the pelagic foodweb, primarily as regenerators of nitrogen, which sustains phytoplankton growth, and as a food source for larger heterotrophs of the metazoan foodweb during the nanophytoplankton-dominated bloom.",

A single shallow-water oceanic island spiny lobster (Jasus tristani) has similar egg characteristics (size and E/R values) to those of the deep-water lobsters. The hypothesis is presented that large E/R values in the shallow-water spiny lobsters and crabs may be an evolutionary response to high rates of mortality of larval and juvenile stages in the nearshore coastal environment. Small size of eggs is considered to be an adaptation to allow for larger brood sizes and greater egg production in the shallow-water species.",

Males mature earlier than females, but there is little difference in length at different levels of sexual maturity for the two species. The Schnute, Von Bertalanffy and linear growth equations are fitted to the age-length data by maximizing the likelihood function. The Schnute growth equation occasionally provides a statistically superior fit to the data than the Von Bertalanffy equation. However, both these equations provide a reasonable fit over the age ranges considered. The growth curve is near linear for females, but less so for males. It appears that females grow slightly faster than males. However, the difference in growth rate is less than that suggested by some previous age-and-growth analyses. It is not possible to determine whether or not the values of the growth and maturation parameters have changed in response to changes in abundance because of differences in the estimation procedures used by different authors and the lack of estimates of the precision of historical estimates. As the difference between the two species for both maturation and growth is not particularly marked, it seems justified to use one set of growth/maturity parameter values when performing assessments.",

The fishery now spans four decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, hake were exploited heavily by mainly foreign fleets, total catches peaking at more than 800 000 tons in 1972. The first control measures, the use of a minimum mesh size of 110 mm and the allocation of quotas to each member country participating in the hake fishery, were implemented by the International Commission for the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries in 1975. In 1990, the Namibian Government took action to control fishing activities in Namibian waters, and the enactment of its Fisheries Policy (1991) and Sea Fisheries Act of 1992 provided for the control measures to be taken. The conservative management strategy adopted between 1990 and 1993 resulted in gradual increase in hake biomass, but thereafter the stock declined. The hake fishery is currently managed on the basis of a total allowable catch that takes into consideration the rate of increase or decrease in the size of the resource. Since 1990, the demersal trawl fishery has accounted for approximately 90% of the total hake catch. The resource is subjected to both directed fishing and bycatch, the latter taken in directed fisheries for species such as horse mackerel, monkfish and sole.",

At offshore islands, where colonies of seabirds breed and roost, intertidal waters are enriched with nutrients from dissolved guano, and the growth rate of algae is enhanced. Comparison of mid-intertidal communities from island and nearby mainland shores showed that mainland communities were characterized by the absence of foliose algae and sessile filter-feeders, and the presence of large areas of \"vacant\", rocky surface. On island shores, mats of foliose algae dominated mid-intertidal communities and herbivorous limpets grew more rapidly and attained larger sizes. Dense populations of African black oystercatchers, which feed on limpets, occurred on island shores, but they were absent from mainland shores. The effects of nutrient enrichment at islands were evident, not only in the rate of primary production, but also in interactions between organisms at higher trophic levels and in the structure and functioning of the intertidal community as a whole.",

The pilchard length frequency distribution in gannet diet and research midwater trawl samples in this area provided a clear linkage, through the known juvenile growth rate, with fish of an average 6 months of age, which were abundant off the West Coast during May 1983. Pilchard in this year-class were subsequently found to be widely distributed over the Agulhas Bank, with a tendency for them to inhabit deeper water towards the shelf edge as they reached the age of first spawning (about 18 months). During 1985, a noticeable increase in the abundance of large, two-year-old and older pilchard in the diet of West Coast gannets and in West Coast commercial catches indicated a movement of 1982/83 year-class fish into that area.

Counts were made from sectioned vertebral centra by two readers. There was a statistically significant difference between the growth functions of both sexes and Von Bertalanffy growth functions were L∞ = 196.3 cm, k = 0.146 year−1 and t0 = −2.3 year for males; L∞ = 232.8 cm, k = 0.1 year−1 and t0 = −2.9 year for females. This difference was thought to be attributable to initially faster growth rate of males until maturity, after which their growth rate slowed below that of females. Number of growth rings at maturity was 8–10 for both males (150 cm PCL) and females (160 cm PCL). The oldest female and male in the sample had 17 (213 cm PCL) and 19 growth rings (192 cm PCL) respectively. Annual growth ring deposition could not be validated using marginal increment ratio analysis because of the small sample size. Geographic variation in growth rate and maximum attainable size was evident between the spinner shark populations of the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Although C. brevipinna grow slowly, the protective nets off the KwaZulu-Natal coast do not appear to have any detrimental effect on the population.Keywords: AGECARCHARHINUS BREVIPINNAGROWTHKWAZULU-NATALSHARKVERTEBRA",

    "abstract": "Stomach content analyses were performed on the Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi. The contents were identified to species level and the dietary importance of each component assessed by employing unrelated quantifying methods, which were subsequently combined to determine an index of relative importance (IRI). The index was determined on a seasonal basis as well as for individual sampling stations. The aquatic macrophyte Zostera capensis was the single most abundant item and, together with filamentous algae, constituted the major proportion (IRI = 7 314) of the diet. Crustacea were the next most abundant (IRI = 6 534), followed by Mollusca (IRI = 160). Stomach contents from the sampling stations in the lower reaches were dominated by aquatic macrophytes and algae, whereas those from the middle and upper reaches had a higher incidence of Crustacea. Mollusca in the diet were uniformly distributed throughout the estuary. There was considerable flexibility in the feeding pattern of R. holubi.",

Some 48.3% of juvenile lobsters (carapace length <65 mm) but only 2.1% of larger lobsters migrated further than 20 km. Movements were mostly north-eastwards (91.7% of migrants), for both sexes, and the migration rate of the fastest 5% of migrants was 0.43 km day−1.

The commercial fishery uses traps covered with 90-mm mesh. In order to be able to use the density results obtained by this survey from traps covered with 60-mm mesh, a preliminary mesh selectivity study was carried out. The carapace width at 50-per-cent retention for 90-mm mesh was estimated as 72 mm. Based on the EFA results, it seems that most commercial fishing takes place in areas of crab density varying between 46 and 231 crabs·ha−1, but that densities can reach ∼510 crabs·ha−1. It is suggested that crab traps would fish more efficiently on the northern South West African crab grounds if longlines were set across the depth contours rather than in a longshore direction.",

Specimens were sampled between 1978 and 1981, and they ranged in size between 226 and 1 701 mm total length. Largest line catches were recorded between spring (August) and late summer (March) in inshore areas (<40 m depth). Trawl catches of kob made in deeper water (54—117 m) peaked in winter and summer. Long-term trends in the trawl fishery suggest that the stock size decreased greatly after the mid-1960s. Estimates of mortality of line-caught kob were high, with Z values of 1,52 between ages 2 and 5, and 0,50 between ages 5 and 11. An overall sex ratio of 1 male to 1,8 females was recorded. Sexual maturity is attained by 250 mm total length, and evidence of spawning was found throughout the year, with a major peak from July to December. Atractoscion aequidens (geelbek) of 283—992 mm fork length were also caught by the line fishery, but sporadically throughout the year. A sex ratio of 1 male to 1,2 females was recorded. First sexual maturity of males apparently occurs at ± 590 mm and of females at ± 650 mm, although this should be viewed with discretion because spawning probably occurs outside the study area between May and July.",

    "abstract": "By simulating an upwelling event in a laboratory microcosm, it was possible to promote the development of a natural and diverse planktonic community. An initial bacterioplankton community which developed in response to phytoplankton growth was dominated by small coccoid forms (0,14–0,2 μm3) of the genera Vibrio and Pseudomonas. This group was heavily exploited by the heterotrophic microflagellate Pseudobodo sp. (30 μm3). Later, the bacterioplankton community was dominated by large rods (0,7 μm3) which the flagellates seemed unable to exploit. A Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model fitted to the observed data indicated that the flagellates consumed 2,4 times their carbon body mass per day or 19 bacteria·flagellate−1·h−1 when prey were not limiting. Clearance rates were inversely proportional to prey density and ingestion rate, ranging from 2 × 10−3 to 20 × 10−3) μℓ·flagellate−1·h−1. At typical field densities of bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates in the southern Benguela region, between 5 and 30 percent of the water column could be cleared per day. Specific growth rates of the flagellates were positively related to prey density, the maximal rate being 0,84 · d−1. Their initially faster growth rates allowed bacteria to increase in numbers despite predation. The growth yield of the flagellates (34–36 per cent) was also positively related to food density. Such low values suggest inefficient transfer of carbon to higher trophic orders but considerable nitrogen regeneration. Nitrogen excretion rates were approximately 6–7 μg N·mg dry weight−1·h−1, comparable to other flagellates but faster than ciliates. These rates are comparable with in situ measurements of NH+4-N excretion in pycnoclinal regions based on 15N isotope studies but are only about 20 per cent of measured rates in surface waters. This is interpreted to mean that, in pycnoclinal regions where the relative input of \"new\" nitrogen is high, there are few regenerative steps and the model describes them satisfactorily. In surface waters, observed rates of excretion can only be accounted for by many regenerative steps in a highly complex food chain in which the cumulative total of nitrogen excretion at each step amounts to that based on 15N labelling studies.",

Samples were taken monthly between August 1993 and March 1994 and September 1994 and March 1995. A comparison of eggs and larval distributions with current features from selected months supports previous studies, indicating that the frontal jet plays an important role in the transport of the early life history stages of anchovy and sardine, but that the position of such transport can vary between the 200 and 500-m isobaths. During October 1994, November 1994 and February 1995, the greatest concentrations of eggs corresponded with areas of strong north-north-westerly flow just beyond the 200 m isobath off the Cape Peninsula, whereas in November 1993 and January 1994 eggs were concentrated farther offshore, increasing the vulnerability of developing larvae to further dispersion offshore. Offshore concentrations, intensified by strong south-easterly winds, occurred during January 1994. Areas of probable egg loss include the western Agulhas Bank, where currents flowing south-south-west can remove eggs before they are transported to the West Coast. Offshore currents also can develop west of the Cape Peninsula, but onshore currents are able to return eggs to the region of the jet, from where they are transported northwards. Other losses may result from offshore transport in the outer branch of the frontal jet off Cape Columbine. Variations in the ability of the jet current flowing north-north-west to transport eggs and larvae to areas favourable for growth and survival may influence recruitment success.",

Four records (Lüideritz, Port Nolloth, Simonstown and Mossel Bay) approach 30 years in duration. An exploratory statistical analysis revealed the presence of high frequency fluctuations, a distinct seasonal signal and a slowly varying interannual structure. The serial correlation suggested the use of Box-Jenkins models to separate out the various contributions and enabled statistical estimates of underlying trends in sea level with realistic error estimates to be made. A linear trend at Port Nolloth was significantly different from zero, and its consistency with the trend from the two other West Coast sites led to the conclusion that, over the past 30 years, sea level has been rising on the west coast of Namibia and South Africa at a rate estimated at 0,12 ± 0,04 cm·year−1. By contrast there was no consistent upward trend at Mossel Bay on the South Coast. These estimates agree with recent published estimates of a global rate of rise in sea level, tempered by the movement of the land surface relative to the ocean to compensate for ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment. Consequently, estimates of future rise in sea level attributable to global warming can be extrapolated to the coasts of Namibia and South Africa.",

In all, 27 new host records were established. N. yamagutii and N. africana were the most abundant parasites, infesting seven and six of the examined fish and cephalopod species respectively. The squid Todarodes angolensis and the teleost Ventrifossa nasuta had the highest prevalence of infestation (79 and 75 % respectively). Whereas the teleost Saurida undosquamis was infested with four different Nybelinia species, most hosts harboured a single species only. To date, a total of 47 different Nybelinia species are known. Of these, 43 are considered to be adequately described. N. beveridgei sp. nov. can be distinguished by its large scolex and its homeoacanthous heteromorphous tentacular armature and its characteristic basal armature. For further taxonomic work and to simplify Nybelinia identification, a new subdivision of the species is proposed, based on the following 3 characters: metabasal tentacular armature; tentacles with or without a characteristic basal armature; and size of basal hooks in comparison to metabasal hooks.

The micro-incremental pattern of deposition in the otoliths conformed to the general pattern of otolith structure described in the literature. Sparid otoliths consist of a central opaque nuclear region, composed of a nucleus and multiple accessory primordia. Daily increments surround the nuclear region, which decrease in width as the distance from the nucleus increase. At the macroscopic level, under transmitted light, narrow opaque and wide translucent annual growth zones were identified in sectioned otoliths. Scanning electron microscope analysis of the annual growth zones revealed that the micro-increments within the opaque zones are narrowly spaced with prominent discontinuous phases (D-zone). This results in a higher protein content and greater optical density of the zone. The translucent zones are composed of widely spaced, daily increments with prominent incremental phases (L-zone), accounting for the translucent nature of this zone. Opaque-zone formation was shown to be indicative of slow growth and was correlated with periods of reproductive activity in some of the species studied. The translucent zone is formed after the spawning season and represents fast growth.",

The accuracy of dietary descriptions for dusky kob depends on sample size, sampling frequency and sampling period. A. japonicus in the marine environment fed on a wide variety of organisms, including benthic, epibenthic and pelagic crustaceans, cephalopods and teleosts. Teleosts were by far the most important taxon, but at the species level the principal items varied with environment. There was a general increase in the importance of squid and teleosts, and a concomitant decrease in the importance of crustacea with growth. Feeding frequency and intensity were generally higher in the surf zone than in nearby estuaries, which demonstrates the importance of the former as a foraging area. Dusky kob from surf zones with mixed reef/sand substrata fed more regularly, ate larger meals and consumed a wider variety of organisms (38 v. 28) than did those from predominantly sandy substrata. It is concluded that A. japonicus is a top predator that influences the pelagic and demersal food chains of estuaries, the surf zone and the nearshore environment, and that its currently depleted condition has almost certainly had an impact on the foodwebs of all three of those habitats.",

At a site dominated by recruits of anchovy Engraulis capensis, the hake were almost exclusively piscivorous.

The material was collected in the course of several cruises carried out off Namibia during winter and spring. The coastal area was under the influence of strong upwelling, characterized by surface isotherms running parallel to the coast and, except for some slope stations, the water column from the surface to 200 m deep showed almost no stratification. Analysis of vertical distributions showed that eggs and larvae of all species were widely distributed throughout the water column, with a maximum within the upper 100 m. Spatial patterns of ichthyoplankton distributions in the northern Benguela during intense upwelling seasons show clear segregation into coast and slope (oceanic) areas. Two species, lanternfish Lampanyctodes hectoris and lightfish Maurolicus muelleri, dominated the oceanic area. In the coastal area, the most abundant species was Sufflogobius bibarbatus. During one of the surveys, large numbers of eggs and larvae of slope species were found much nearer the coast than usual south of 26°S.

Research over the past 20 years into the causes of population changes of some abundant fish species, some southern pinnipeds and the most important guano-producing seabirds is briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to populations off south-western Africa. Fish populations have been influenced in a complex manner by a variety of factors, including fishing, biological interactions and environmental change. Climate, operating at a basin scale, is probably an important cause of large and long-term changes in the abundance of some sardine populations. The impact of anticipated climate change on sardine-rich ecosystems is expected to receive emphasis in the future. The populations of some pinnipeds and seabirds were drastically reduced by former excessive harvests. Whereas pinnipeds have tended to recover under regimes of controlled exploitation, the numbers of some seabirds have continued to decrease even in the absence of exploitation. Various factors have contributed to the ongoing decreases, including competition with fisheries for prey resources and competition with pinnipeds for breeding space. The 1980s saw the introduction of legislation specifying conservation of marine ecosystems as a management objective in Antarctica and South Africa. Means of achieving this objective, given the biological interactions at the upper end of the trophic pathway, are expected to provide another focus for future research.",

    "abstract": "The Namibian linefishery is a multisector fishery, with recreational and commercial sectors targeting overlapping species. Prior to 1990, catch data were recorded for the boat sector, but little research was done on the population dynamics of any of the species. Hence, none of the stocks were assessed owing to the lack of parameter estimates for fisheries modelling. Current management regulations for the Namibian linefishery are therefore not based on scientific investigations but, for historical reasons, were adapted from South African legislation for similar species. From 1994, linefish research in Namibia focused on the life history and population dynamics of silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus and West Coast steenbras Lithognathus aureti, important species in both commercial and recreational sectors. A roving-roving creel survey was used to determine effort and catches of recreational shore-anglers. Both species were assessed using yield-per-recruit models. Based on the results, reduced daily bag limits and the implementation of size limits for the recreational sector were proposed. For the commercial sector, the introduction of a total allowable catch would seem to be the best option. Results from an economic survey indicated that the recreational sector earns six times more for the country annually than the commercial sector.",

Of the elasmobranchs, 12 species had squid in their stomachs, nine of these with a high incidence (>33% frequency of occurrence). The squid were in spawning condition when taken and no spent squid were recovered from stomach contents. There was no evidence that squid had been moribund when ingested and no dead or moribund squid were encountered while diving during the two-year study. Cannibalism by squid was observed.

    "abstract": "The pulsing of the southern Benguela ecosystem ensures repeated replenishment of nutrients during active upwelling and phytoplankton blooming when the wind relaxes. Upwelling cycles are associated with the passage of coastal trapped waves in the shelf water. Under most circumstances, these are closely matched with an overlying coastal low. The irregular passage of coastal lows, in response to ridging high pressure cells driven by southern hemisphere mid-latitude Rossby waves, induces a system of opposing winds which propagates southwards along the west coast of southern Africa. The detail of this mechanism is examined through time-series of environmental variables over the southern Benguela shelf. The time-series displays considerable variability in the duration and the amplitude of upwelling events. An optimum pulse frequency of some 10 days is suggested. At that frequency, the free and forced modes of coastal trapped waves match and the amplitude of change between active and passive upwelling phases is greatest. Also, the 10-day pulse frequency is sufficiently short to ensure a continual resupply of nutrients and primary productivity to the fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Data collected by questionnaire and telephone surveys conducted during 1998 and 1999 are used to describe the socio-economic characteristics of inshore netfishers in the Western Cape. Approximately two-thirds of netfishers work or have worked in other fishing sectors and a further 6–50%, depending on the area surveyed, are retired. Very few (0–11%) permit-holders in most areas classified their occupations as netfishers and the majority claimed to make <5% of their income from netfishing. Estimated costs and returns to net permit-holders suggest that, in most areas, commercial netfishing at current levels of catch and effort is not economically sustainable in the long-term. Only Saldanha-Langebaan gillnetters and beach-seine permit-holders, on average, manage to cover their opportunity costs and make an economic profit. The lack of profits in other areas is compelling evidence that the net fisheries are at or beyond the open access equilibrium point, suggesting that effort reduction in the order of 60% is necessary if maximum economic yield is to be obtained from the fishery. The netfisheries provide part-time employment for approximately 2 000 crew in the Western Cape. Additional economic benefits and employment directly related to the fishery in the form of equipment and fuel purchases made by fishers, maintenance of fishing gear and the sale of fish are estimated to contribute at least R15 million to the regional economy annually. Between 42 and 76% of respondents felt that their catches had declined since they had started netfishing and most felt that no new permits should be issued. Knowledge of catch restrictions among respondents was low (53–73%), indicative of a lack of communication between management and fishers, poorly defined permit conditions and a lack of enforcement. Many fishers interviewed feel it is unfair that they are restricted to catching only low-value target species and do not adhere to the catch restrictions, even if they do know them. The importance of the netfishery for participants varies greatly between and within areas. In order to reduce effort equitably, current and potential new permit-holders should be assessed on an individual merit basis.

Sei whales were usually encountered off the edge of the continental shelf, with males being caught closer inshore than females and mature females furthest of all from the station. Females reached puberty at an average length of 46.1 ft(14.1 m) and an age of 8.2 (95% CI = 7.3, 9.0) years (assuming one growth layer group is formed in the ear plug per year). Males reached sexual maturity at an average length of 45.3 ft(13.8 m) and an age of 8.6 (95% CI = 7.8, 9.4) years. Mean lengths at which growth ceased were 52 ft(15.8 m) in females and 48.6 ft(14.8 m) in males. Most (∼90%) conceptions occurred over a 70-day period with a peak in June, and primigravid females conceived six days later than multigravid females. Observed pregnancy rates were as high as 86.1%, but with ovulation rates averaging only 0.47 a year, the catch could not have been fully representative of the population. There was no significant decline in the observed pregnancy rate with age. During the northward migration (May–July), fewer whales were taken in water shallower than 2 000 m than in the southern migration, and the catch was largely composed of immatures. The few adult males taken at that time of year had significantly heavier testes than males of an equivalent size on the southern migration. The southward migration (August–October) was markedly structured, such that pregnant females and immatures of both sexes were in the vanguard, followed by mature males and lastly lactating females and calves. The availability of sei whales off Donkergat declined rapidly from 1965 to 1967, following an episode of massive catching by pelagic whalers in higher latitudes.",

Data were derived from trawl surveys conducted on board the R.V. Dr Fridtjof Nansen during the period 1991–1999. In addition to trawl surveys, acoustic methods were applied concurrently to quantify fish biomass off the bottom (above the headline). The pelagic component of hake was variable in both time and space – it was denser in the north and at depths of 200–500 m. Pelagic densities also correlated well with the density of adult fish (≥30 cm) at the bottom, but not with that of young hake (>18 and <30 cm) at the bottom. Pelagic densities were lowest at midday and highest at night, early morning and late afternoon densities being intermediate between the two. Incorporation of acoustic methods allows for at least partial account to be taken of diurnal variation in determining catchability. The fraction of the biomass off the bottom was not the same each year, thus affecting assessment and management advice for the stock, even if the survey results are treated only as relative indices of abundance. More field studies are needed to investigate the size range and species of hake active in vertical migration.Keywords: ACOUSTIC CORRECTIONBOTTOM TRAWL SURVEYSCAPE HAKEVERTICAL MIGRATION",

In all, 83% of the specimens collected were found in shelter. Small octopuses were more active than large individuals during the day, 37% of the former and 8% of the latter being found outside of shelters. All males >170 g were mature, the smallest male being 136 g. No mature females were found in the study area, and maturing females spanned a broad size range caught (275–3 600 g). Average size at spawning is probably between 1 500 and 2 500 g. Although there were no significant overall differences in mass between sexes (p > 0.05), the average mass of octopus in winter (766 g) was significantly smaller than in summer (1 161 g) and spring (964 g). Fluctuations in the average size of octopus tracked subsurface water temperature. The overall sex ratio was significantly biased towards males (0.6F:1.0M, p < 0.01), largely because fewer females were caught during spring and summer. Spawning likely occurs throughout the year. However, significantly higher (p < 0.01) female gonadal somatic indices of 0.52 and 0.46 found in spring and summer respectively (periods of warmer water in False Bay) may indicate peak spawning during those seasons.

The possibility that the observed trend was an artifact of changing distribution of fishing or shifting seasonality of spawning relative to the three-month period of sample collection was rejected following analysis of variance on spatially disaggregated data and inspection of seasonal patterns in ovary mass. Other causes of the increase in mean ovary mass could have been density-dependence, declining age structure, changes in the environment and selection for early maturity under prolonged high rates of mortality.

    "abstract": "The biomass and productivity of phytoplankton populations inshore on the west coast of South Africa were investigated towards the end of the upwelling season, a period when high-biomass dinoflagellate blooms are common. Productivity was estimated from natural fluorescence measurements (PNF ), using photosynthesis (P) v. irradiance (E) relationships (PE ) and by means of the in situ 14C-method (PC ) A linear regression of PNF productivity against PC and PE productivities yielded a slope of 0.911 and an r 2 of 0.83 (n = 41). Physical and biological variability was high inshore, reflecting alternating periods of upwelling and quiescence. Mean chlorophyll inshore (within a 12 m water column) ranged from 0.7 to 57.8 (mean = 8.9) mg·m&minus3, mean PNF productivity ranged from 8.4 to 51.0 (mean = 24.6) mgC·m−3·h−1 and daily integral PNF productivity from 0.8 to 4.8 (mean = 2.3) gC·m−2·day−l. Transects sampled during active and relaxation phases of upwelling had different chlorophyll distributions. High chlorophyll concentrations (sometimes >50 mg·m−3) were associated with surface blooms within the region of the upwelling front. Estimates of daily water-column PNF productivity within these frontal blooms ranged from 4.0 to 5.6 gC·m−2·day−1. With relaxation of wind stress, blooms dominated by dinoflagellates flooded shorewards and often formed red tides. Chlorophyll concentrations of > 175 mg·m−3 and productivity rates > 500 mgC·m−3·h−1 and 12 gC·m−2·day−1 were measured during a particularly intense red tide. Offshore, the water column was highly stratified with a well-defined subsurface chlorophyll maximum layer within the pycnocline region. Estimates of daily water-column PNF productivity ranged from 2.4 to 4.0 gC·m−2·day−1 offshore. The high productivity of shelf waters on the West Coast in late summer can be ascribed largely to dinoflagellate populations and their success in both upwelling systems and stratified conditions.",

Data, for anchovy Engraulis capensis were considered to be more accurate than those available for other species and are examined in some detail. The average monthly biomass of this species during the years 1984–1988 was estimated to be 352 000 tons off the West Coast and 754 000 tons off the South Coast. The biomass of anchovy peaked in May off the West Coast and in December off the South Coast. The rate of intake of food by the anchovy population was estimated to be 1,88 per cent of dry body mass per day, and some 90 per cent of the diet consisted of meso- and macrozooplankton. The average monthly biomass of the total fish assemblage (anchovy, pilchard Sardinops ocellatus, round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi, lanternfish Lampanyctodes hectoris and lightfish Maurolicus muelleri) was estimated to be of the order of two million tons off each coast. The total annual consumption of carbon by these fish in the two regions was 2,0 and 1,6 million tons respectively, some 95 percent of this meso- and macrozooplankton.

Significant differences in growth rate were recorded between months, the slowest growth rates occurring in anchovy which had hatched during the period of peak spawning in late spring and early summer. Growth rates of juvenile anchovy of the 1986 recruiting year-class were approximately 25 per cent lower than those of previous year-classes sampled for daily growth analysis.",

Results revealed sea temperature and wind to be correlated with catches during part of the summer upwelling season (October and December) in 1988. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that sea temperature was a highly significant explanatory variable (p = 0,0000) for catches from three boats, as well as for the overall catch. Wind direction also played a significant role (p = 0,0085) in the overall catch. A statistical linear multiple regression model is proposed for each boat and for the total catch. Upwelling events are suggested to play a major role in the availability of squid on the inshore spawning grounds (<50 m) during summer. With further study, other independent physical variables, such as currents, swell height and turbidity, are likely to be introduced into the proposed model.",

Over the studied temperature range and at standard rates of oxygen consumption, J. lalandii had a Q 10 value of 2,5. Plotted for five temperatures, the graph of oxygen consumption rates had a typical sigmoidal appearance, with a flatter response (Q 10 = 1,7) between 10 and 13°C, which coincides with the modal habitat temperature. At 19°C, the animals appeared stressed and showed an easing in respiration rate, with Q 10 = 1,4. Respiration is mass-dependent, metabolic rate being inversely proportional to body mass. Responses to a short-term drop in temperature of 5°C produce a rapid decrease in consumption rate of oxygen, with no undershoot occurring and with no suggestion of acclimation taking place. An increase of 5°C also induced a rapid response which resulted in an overshoot, followed by a gradual return over 2–5 days to the predicted rate, which could not be interpreted as one of acclimation. For a population of rock lobsters off Robben Island, north-west of Cape Town, at a mean annual temperature of 13°C, animals metabolize, on average, the equivalent of their body mass of carbon each year. This represents an irreversible energy loss to the biotic community and is equivalent to the oxidation of 26 g C·m−2·year−1.",

The sand sharks were concentrated in specific areas of the lagoon, and their distribution appeared to be correlated with that of prey biomass. Crustaceans constituted the major portion (88,12%) of the diet. Calculations suggest that 26–77 per cent of the annual invertebrate production is consumed by sand sharks, so it is evident that R. annulatus has a substantial impact on the macrofauna and thereby plays an important role as a predator in Langebaan Lagoon.",

Monthly variations within each zooplankton group differed between the West Coast and the Agulhas Bank. Euphausiids did not respond to seasonal changes characteristic of the three areas. In the copepod group seasonality was found, principally in the Cape Peninsula area, and also in the St Helena Bay/Cape Columbine area where there was evidence of offshore displacement during the upwelling season (September-March). There was limited evidence of biomass being highest nearest the coast. Biomass variability (coefficient of variation) was highest nearest the coast and decreased markedly with distance offshore. Euphausiid biomass was generally more variable than copepod biomass.",

The present study provides a descriptive and statistical evaluation of monthly oil-to-meal ratios of pelagic fish landings processed at different ports of both the northern and southern Benguela systems, i.e. two in Namibia, four on South Africa's west coast, and one on the South Coast. These time-series, and an aggregate of four Western Cape ports, are described and analysed statistically for seasonally, temporal trends and coherence between ports, covering the period since 1950/51. The seasonal signal was important at all ports, explaining about 25% of the variance and having an amplitude of about 45% in relation to average. Both percentages were higher in the earlier part of the time-series. A significant negative trend was also apparent at all ports over the whole time-series, but it was manifested most strongly from 1980 to 1993. A model producing year-factors identified outliers in the time-series and these often coincided with known environmental anomalies. Also, cross-correlation showed highly significant coherence in the data from the northern and the southern Benguela but less coherence between the southern Benguela and the adjacent South Coast. The extent to which the oil data reflect environmental factors as opposed to fishing and technological factors is discussed, and some associations with recruitment patterns are noted.",

Algoa Bay, South Africa. Foraging trip durations were bimodally distributed. Most foraging trips of Cape gannets were completed within 24 h. Metered gannets spent c. 40% of this time flying. In all, nine prey species were recovered from the stomachs of metered birds. The diet was dominated by the commercially important sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis capensis. Food mass intake by foraging Cape gannets was not correlated with foraging trip duration or time flying, consistent with a patchy distribution of food. Cape gannets returning with sardine tended to have shorter foraging trips and spent significantly less time flying than birds returning with other prey, thereby maximizing net energy intake. Sardine seem to be the preferred (most profitable) prey and, consequently, their relative proportion in gannet stomachs may reflect their absolute availability at spatial scales equivalent to the bird's foraging range.",

It is suggested that only two significant sources of new nitrogen were available to the Ulva: the natural nitrate flux from coastal upwelling and the fish factory nitrogen effluent. A significant difference (1.9‰) was found in the mean δ15N values between Ulva samples from a control site at Langebaan Lagoon (8.9‰) and those from Saldanha Bay (10.8‰). The latter value, which is relatively enriched in 15N, is consistent with the view that the nitrogen taken up in Saldanha Bay originated from a trophic position corresponding to pelagic fish in the southern Benguela system.

Data on the prevalence and intensity of these infections are presented. A geographic survey indicated that, whereas the parasite is of widespread occurrence in southern African populations of the brown mussel, the prevalences of infection were relatively low, ranging from 2 to 12%. More detailed studies of bucephalid infections in mussels from the Dwesa Nature Reserve showed that prevalence of infection was independent of the tidal elevation of the mussel population but was not independent of season. The latter observation probably reflects seasonal differences in the size composition of the mussel populations. Although the distribution of mussels is generally aggregated, infected animals were apparently distributed at random. The majority of parasitized mussels were at an advanced stage of infection, reflected by significant differences in the condition of infected and non-infected mussels at certain times of the year. As heavy infections are associated with destruction of the host's gonadal tissues, the reproductive potential of infected populations may be impaired. The implications of these observations for the mariculture industry are also discussed.",

Escapement was high, 95% of the combined catch being caught in the cover net. Escapees were numerically dominated by the \"baitfish\" species Engraulis capensis (52%) and Atherina breviceps (36%). A relatively low proportion of \"angling\" species was lost from the commercial net. These species, namely Lithognathus lithognathus, Rhabdosargus globiceps, Pomatomus saltatrix and Diplodus sargus capensis, become vulnerable to capture by commercial beach-seines well before they reach two years of age and long before maturity. It is argued that the substantial increase in mesh size needed to reduce the by-catch of these juvenile \"angling\" species would drastically lower the total catch of Liza richardsonii, the principal target species of the commercial beach-seine fishery.",

    "abstract": "Physical processes in the ocean influence biological processes at all scales from microns to thousands of kilometres. The viscous boundary layer around phytoplankton limits nutrient uptake; partial relief is obtained by sinking or swimming. During the progress of an upwelling event, diatoms, which sink, tend to be replaced by flagellates, which swim. The formation of a dense layer of flagellates in a stratified water column may be critical to the survival of first-feeding fish larvae. At the scale of 10–100 m, vertical mixing brings nutrients to the surface, but stratification holds phytoplankton in the euphotic zone. Alternation of these two processes in an upwelling system is critical to high productivity. On an interannual scale, the productivity of upwelling systems may be limited by the intrusion of anomalous warm surface waters. This process is well documented for the Peruvian upwelling system (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) and a similar process has been observed in the Benguela system. There are tentative correlations between these events and changes in the population dynamics of pilchard, anchovy and hake. In general, physical factors tend to dominate marine ecosystem function, and prediction of fish productivity requires an ability to predict physical events.",

    "abstract": "During 1997, considerable scientific differences arose about the status of the Namibian hake (Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus) resource, and as to whether the hake Total Allowable Catch (TAC) should be substantially decreased or increased. These differences revolved primarily around whether or not abundance estimates from the swept-area trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen should be considered as reliable measures of biomass in absolute (as distinct from relative) terms. The paper relates the computations underlying the Interim Management Procedure (IMP) approach that was put forward at that time as a basis to resolve this impasse. The anticipated performance, in terms of catch and risk of resource depletion, of a number of simple candidate IMPs for the Namibian hake resource is evaluated. The IMPs depend on two parameters, whose values are to be chosen by decision-makers, and adjust the TAC up or down from one year to the next according to whether trends in recent commercial catch rate and survey indices of abundance are positive or negative. Performances are evaluated across the then current wide range argued for resource abundance and status. Trade-offs in performance across the candidates considered are discussed. One of the candidates was subsequently selected by a joint meeting of scientists, industry and Ministry officials in February 1998 and served as the basis for scientific recommendations for the TAC for the hake resource for the following three years.",

    "abstract": "Some problems of cephalopod biodiversity are discussed. Many squid species are represented by 2–4 intraspecies groupings that may be wholly or partly sympatric, but differ in spawning season and size at maturity. They may be genetically distinct stock units, but their taxonomic status remains unresolved. Discovery of a biochemical or molecular key to distinguish between intra- and interspecific differences may help to solve the problem of subspecific taxa in cephalopods, as stated by G. L. Voss in 1977. Electrophoretic study of allozyme differentiation is a good method for clearing up relationships between taxa within a family, but this method cannot be used in situations when the concept of subgenus or subfamily is necessary. The problem of suprafamilial taxa needs urgent attention. However, restructuring only one family or group of families leaving others unrevised may lead to skewing the entire system. Examples are splitting the Enoploteuthidae into three families (as proposed by M. R. Clarke in 1988) and raising the rank of the Sepiidae and the Sepiolidae to ordinal, a proposal by P. Fioroni in 1981. In such cases the method of common level should be applied: subdivisions in a large taxon shall be separated by approximately similar characters. Many attempts to select natural groups of families, for example in the Oegopsida, failed primarily because they were based on analysis of a single organ or system of organs when study of other organs/systems may lead to different natural groupings. The use of molecular techniques in cephalopod phylogeny may be profitable, but initial attempts have led to results that are not easily interpretable. The evolution of Recent Cephalopoda has probably proceeded with such large variations in rates among different clades that it is impossible to construct a non-contradictory system based on any single organ or system. No single organ/system-of-organs nor single methodology currently exists that will solve every problem in taxonomy. An integrated approach, based on analysis of as many organs and different taxa as possible, is necessary to construct an accurate picture and not a mosaic of dispersed random pieces.",

They are found in a water column that includes myctophids and other mesopelagic fish, euphausiids and cephalopods. Together with their cohabitant potential prey, hake are known to undertake diurnal vertical migrations, aggregating near the bottom during daylight, but migrating off the bottom at night. An attempt to determine the underlying mechanisms of this diurnal migration by means of underwater acoustics and trawling was made at a single location on the central Namibian shelf at a depth of 350 m during four consecutive days in April 1996. Large M. capensis, 50–75 cm total length, dominated just over the sea bed, whereas 30–40 cm M. paradoxus were most abundant 5–50 m off the bottom, suggesting that the smaller M. paradoxus had to remain higher in the water column to avoid being eaten by the larger M. capensis. Large hake of both species preyed preferentially on fish, whereas the smaller hake preferred euphausiids, although there was some evidence of euphausiid consumption by most hake. There was no distinct daily feeding rhythm in either species of hake, although there was some evidence of evening predation dominating. This may indicate a feeding strategy where vision is not important.",

The impact of such gradients was addressed by analysing the gladius growth of 1585 juvenile squid collected across the Gulf Stream and shelf/slope fronts during research cruises conducted between 1979 and 1989. Temperature- and size-specific growth potential, as estimated by a bioenergetics model, were compared to measured gladius growth rates and revealed that young Illex were energetically expensive and food-limited in Gulf Stream waters (their hatching environment). Growth condition improved inshore, where metabolic costs decreased and more food became available. Similar patterns were observed when size-specific growth rates of squid caught across the temperature and food gradients were directly compared. In addition, transport processes in the Gulf Stream and slope water played an important role in providing access and retention in favourable areas. Juvenile onshore migration seems to be driven by elevated food requirements and involves physiological adaptations to compensate for decreasing temperatures. The individual \"success\" in terms of growth and survival may depend, however, on access to concentrated patches of food which, in turn, will be determined by timing and the transport dynamics of the main water masses.",

This indicates that distribution on the South Coast may be different from that in other areas, possibly because of the presence there of offshore reefs, the continued degradation of the Natal inshore environment and the 1987 floods. There were probably fewer than 350 bottlenose dolphins off the South Coast, an apparent decline since the last survey of the area in 1985. Incidental captures of bottlenose dolphins on the South Coast average 24 animals per year, more than 7 per cent of the estimated maximum number.

Their presence in bottom trawls at depths of 333–879 m, but their absence from benthopelagic and pelagic trawls, is consistent with a primarily benthic habitat. The largest single sample, 40 animals, came from a soft mud bottom and highlights the patchy nature of the distribution. Males tended to be bigger in total length and mass than females of similar mantle length. The males, however, were mature at a smaller size. Mature males have tiny sperm packets, rather than typical cephalopod spermatophores, in their distal reproductive tract. Mature females have large, smooth eggs in the proximal oviduct, in the huge oviducal gland and in the distal oviduct. Eggs in the distal oviduct have a thick, sticky coating that hardens in seawater into a secondary egg case. Ovarian eggs vary greatly in size, possibly indicating protracted egg laying. Observations on live animals indicate that the species swims primarily by fin action, rather than by jetting or medusoid pulses with the arm/web complex. It may be capable of limited changes in colour pattern, especially on the oral surface of the web. Three pairs of surface structures that appear superficially to be white spots anterior to the eyes and near the bases of the fins are actually transparent patches in the skin. When considered in association with the transparent subdermal layer and the anatomy of the eyes, optic nerves and optic lobes, these clear patches seem to function in detecting unfocused light on the horizontal plane of the benthic animal.",

Field observations of larvae and settlement in the California Current by recent workers are an example of the increasing research on the biological/physical mechanisms underlying larval transport. In particular, these studies identify physical/biological interactions that control the spatial distribution of larvae settling successfully. The current study demonstrates how the results of such studies contribute to (1) better understanding of population dynamics, and (2) better population management, using the cyclic covariability in the Dungeness crab Cancer magister population as an example of the former and management of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus population as an example of the latter. Earlier modelling studies have shown that dispersal influences the stability and synchrony of variability in metapopulations such as the Dungeness crab, and that the spatial scale of covariability is roughly the scale of dispersal. The mechanism identified by recent research implies that the spatial scale of dispersal should be the distance between promontories in the California Current, roughly 100–200 km. Analysis of covariability between time-series of recruitment at different locations along the coast confirm that this is the spatial scale of longshore variability in the Dungeness crab. The spatial pattern in red sea urchin settlement caused by the identified mechanism provides: (1) the basis for spatially explicit management, and (2) an explanation for the observed spatial variability in the degree of overfishing. Research on larval dispersal is also providing the information necessary to design spatially explicit management strategies involving either permanent or temporary fishery closures. Both population dynamics and management require further research to describe the origins of larvae and the early larval phase, in addition to the transport just before settlement.",

The first three principal components accounted for 87% of the total variance in the standardized input images and were the only components retained for interpretation. Principal Component I (PC I) represents the mean spatial structure of the system in terms of relative SST gradients, PC II represents the balance in dominance between inshore-offshore v. longshore SST gradients and PC III highlights patterns associated with the warming of the central Namibian region (19–23°S) in conjunction with the maintenance of cooler conditions to the north and/or south. These results are interpreted within the context of previous findings on the behaviour of the system, and their relevance to clupeoid recruitment is discussed. Strong negative loadings on PC II indicated conditions which would promote the longshore \"retention\" of clupeoid eggs and larvae and \"concentration\" of planktonic food across thermoclines and thermal fronts, whereas strong positive loadings on PC III indicated conditions which would promote onshore retention and concentration. Conditions promoting onshore retention would, on occasion, have also been reflected by positive loadings on PC II whenever there was a uniform contraction of the offshore upwelling front, as a result of reduced, but similar, levels of upwelling along the entire coast.",

The earliest name for blue stingrays is the generally overlooked Trigon chrysonotus Smith, 1828 from South Africa, which is revived, redescribed and has a neotype designated for it. The southern African blue stingray is a separate species from D. pastinaca and differs in coloration, disc length and vertebral and radial counts. However, the southern African blue stingray is considered conspecific with D. marmorata but differs slightly in snout angle and snout-to-vent length. These two are tentatively ranked as subspecies, Dasyatis chrysonota chrysonota (Smith 1828) for the blue stingray of South Africa, Namibia and Angola and D. c. marmorata (Steindachner 1892) for the Senegal blue stingray. Nominal records of blue stingrays exist from Tunisia, Spanish Sahara (Morocco) and Mauritania, tropical West Africa from Liberia to Nigeria, and off Congo, but their status is uncertain. It is uncertain if the known differences between the Senegal and southern African blue stingrays are representative of a north–south clinal gradation, or if there are two or more discrete populations of blue stingrays in the northern and southern hemispheres.",

A wind reversal, to northerly winds in the north and north-westerly winds in the south, followed upwelling and persisted during sample collection. This resulted in the development of a distinct thermohaline front off Cape Columbine. Another consequence was the advection of oceanic water shorewards in the south, disrupting the original pattern of species zonation and redistributing cnidarian assemblages in a longshore pattern. Three different assemblages are differentiated: one north of Cape Columbine, consisting of coastal species, one south of Cape Columbine with a mixture of neritic and oceanic species, and one single-species community with coastal affinity inshore north of Cape Columbine.

The resulting standardized series indicated that resource abundance declined at a rate of 0.4% per annum over the period 1978–1994. Further investigation revealed that the model applied did not adequately adjust for effort being directed away from hake towards other species. This was because, for low bycatch cpue, there was a positive rather than the expected negative correlation with hake catch rates. A method to correct for this inadequate adjustment, taking account of an assumed underlying reason of positively correlated fluctuations in catchability of hake and bycatch species, was developed and tested by simulation. This resulted in a more optimistic view of resource status, indicating a 0.6% per year increase in abundance over the period considered. This result remained contrary to general perceptions in the industry that there was a substantial improvement in resource abundance over the 17-year period considered, as suggested by a 4% increase in abundance per year in nominal cpue. The reasons that the GLM indicated a lesser increase in resource abundance were that the effective average power of the fleet increased, the fleet moved over time to deeper water, where catch rates were higher, and the increase in fish density in deeper water was more than offset by a simultaneous decrease in density in shallower waters. The inadequate bycatch adjustment arose from the analyses inappropriately including bycatch species that co-occur with hake, and hence are taken incidentally in hake-directed fishing, instead of only species whose capture requires a different targeting of effort.

    "abstract": "Regeneration of nutrients from Benguela sediments taken between Lüderitz and Walker Bay, on the leeward side of upwelling centres, was studied by means of two methods. First, porewater samples were taken from sediment cores and analysed for nutrients. The observed concentration gradient was used to estimate the potential flux by diffusion of nutrients across the sediment/water interface. Second, intact sediment cores were incubated at the temperatures and concentrations of dissolved oxygen found at the interface, and the rate of increase of nutrients in the overlying water was monitored. The systems where samples were taken may be classified as semi-closed, as there is preferential settling of particulate organic carbon and regeneration of nutrients from the sediments. Here, the nutrient concentrations in bottom waters exceeded those in upwelling source water by up to 100 per cent, probably because of the regeneration process. More stable water-column conditions on the leeward side of upwelling centres may inhibit exchange of nutrients between bottom waters and the euphotic zone: implications of this possibility are discussed. A mechanism is proposed as to the manner in which nutrient-rich bottom water from St Helena Bay may be advected southwards during current reversals associated with coastal trapped waves. This mechanism would prime the upwelling centre at Cape Columbine and could result in advection of nutrients back into St Helena Bay euphotic zone waters.",

During the November 1996 survey, seven such targets were observed near the bottom at depths of 115–125 m, directly south of the traditional inshore spawning grounds of chokka squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudii at Cape St Francis. The targets were close to prominent seabed ridges and extended 30–40 m off the bottom. In May 1998, three similar targets were observed at depths 55–80 m off Plettenberg Bay, another well-known squid spawning site. The shallowest target was identified, by means of a midwater trawl, as a mixture of mature male and female chokka. During the November 1998 survey, nine similar targets were again observed on the squid spawning grounds at Cape St Francis, also adjacent to seabed ridges. Drawing on fisheries hydroacoustic experience and knowledge of chokka squid spawning behaviour, the targets are believed to be aggregations of spawning squid.

More than 75 per cent of the non-seasonal SST variability was accounted for by the first three principal components. Principal component 1 (PCI) demonstrated region-wide warming and cooling trends, centred within the main shipping lane. Major \"events\" revealed by this component included a strong but fairly short-lived warm event in 1963, a cold period from 1969 through 1971 and a warm period from 1972 to 1975. PC2 isolated SST behaviour at the extreme southern sites which contrasted with that farther north. PC3 was dominated by events in the upwelling regions north of 30°S where warm and cool events differed somewhat in timing and amplitude in comparison with those offshore. Furthermore, this component revealed a warm event in 1967/68 and a pronounced and sustained cool event from 1981 to 1983. Major warm events were accompanied by reduction of average equatorward wind speed and cool events by its augmentation. Heat flux anomalies contributed to the generation and maintenance of SST anomalies offshore. Although local changes in wind forcing accompanied warm and cool events, more remote forcing from the tropical Atlantic was crucial to the evolution of nearshore warm and cool events north of 30°S.",

    "abstract": "It is argued that, in the more productive areas of the world, fish production appears to be based on relatively short food chains. The dynamics of energy transfer are therefore largely concerned with the dynamics of relatively short food chains and in particular with the dynamics of short chains when these are seasonally perturbed. To investigate the process, extensive simulations have been made with models of the marine ecosystem in which simple food webs have been constrained within a closed nitrogen model consisting of animals, plants, inorganic nitrogen and dead organic nitrogen. Within such a closed system, when seasonally perturbed, food limitation at some time or other seems unavoidable, and consideration is given to differences in the ways this might affect larval, juvenile and adult stages. The principal conclusion from this study is that the efficiency of transfer of energy from primary production to fish can be improved in the model by modifications to the inputs that take advantage of seasonal variation in biomasses. The corollary of this finding is that, in nature, efficiency is likely to be gained by adaptations that benefit from, instead of being disadvantaged by, the effects of seasonal variations in biomass at different trophic levels. Factors that may be important in this context are: Migratory habits that can ensure that individuals are located in geographical areas of predictable high food concentrations, at different times of the year; omnivory, which permits an individual to change from feeding at one trophic level to feeding at another trophic level at different times of the year; horizontal displacement of trophic levels, as occurs, for example, in upwelling areas, which could be advantageous because this should avoid many of the difficulties that are expected theoretically when all trophic levels are present in the same vertical column. This study is consistent with classical thinking about species replacement. Thus, if the stock of one species is reduced, by fishing for example, other species cannot be expected to benefit from food that would otherwise have been consumed to the same extent, i.e. it is unlikely that any one species would be able to take over fully the ecological niche of any other species. Differences in behaviour and geographical location are likely to lead to a less efficient use of a resource by species other than those which had evolved to utilize that resource in the first place.",

    "abstract": "Fishing can affect the structure of fish communities, but the size of the effects is difficult to measure and they can easily be confounded with environmental effects. The simplest effect is the increase of prey species when large predators are reduced, but these effects are seldom large. Changes in the balance within a group of ecologically similar species can be much more dramatic, especially in the case of stocks of small pelagic species, and several large fisheries on sardine, herring and anchovy have collapsed, sometimes accompanied by a rise of other species. Part, not all, of these changes can be ascribed to the effects of competition, and of selective fishing directed at one preferred species. Other changes, such as the gadoid outburst in the North Sea in the 1960s, may have involved less obvious mechanisms. Because few of the changes in the community structure can be reliably predicted, although they can have dramatic effects on the success of the fisheries, difficult management problems are raised. Managers have to recognize uncertainty and take a range of possible consequences into account when setting policies.",

There is normally a cyclical pattern of high sexual activity during winter and spring and lesser activity during autumn. During summer, the proportion of sexually active animals is at its lowest and juveniles are at their maximum. During winter, juveniles are at their minimum. However, a major disruption of the pattern occurred at the end of 1982. The proportion of sexually active animals in the population increased dramatically during summer and settlement of larvae did not take place. In addition, there was no settlement of larvae from the abnormal summer breeding event. The normal cycle was resumed towards the end of 1983, with an extensive period of sexual activity followed by a major larval settlement. The period over which the abberations in the breeding cycle occurred, i.e. late 1981 and early 1982, coincides with the Benguela warm event, when surface seawater temperatures were significantly higher than normal. It would appear that the above-average summer water temperatures induced a period of sexual activity akin to that normally observed during winter and spring, while having a deleterious effect on larval survival and settlement.",

Advances in technology now make it possible to determine seabird catch per unit effort very accurately.

Quantification of where, when and how much prey is caught is determined by a complementary autonomic unit residing in the bird's stomach. From this equipment, the spatial distribution of seabird prey can be monitored.

    "abstract": "Beaks of 133 specimens of Todarodes sagittatus caught in the central East Atlantic were studied. Relationships between several measurements of the upper and lower beaks and dorsal mantle length (DML) and total mass were calculated. The darkening process or pigmentation of both beaks was investigated and a qualitative scale of eight degrees of pigmentation developed. Except for the hood of the lower beak, the growth of both beaks was allometrically negative in relation to DML in males, whereas the growth of several parts of both beaks of females was allometrically positive. The hood grew faster than all other parts of the male beak and faster than all parts of the lower beak of females. Regression coefficients calculated for the growth of the beaks revealed differences between the growth patterns of females and males (p < 0.05). The results relating to darkening and the maturing process suggest that they are related and that they take place over a very short period in the life of the squid.",

    "abstract": "South Africa's Tsitsikamma National Park is within the general spawning area for Loligo valgaris reynaudii. Spawning squid use at least 10 areas within its boundaries, sporadically throughout the year, but mainly in early summer. Spawning occurred either on sand or low-profile rocky reef at depths between 22 and 35 m. Concentrations varied between a few hundred spawning pairs, with small and scattered egg mops, to thousands of spawning pairs with a large central egg bed surrounded by smaller egg mops. Squid paralarvae were captured within the boundaries of the Park, and squid tagged there moved to other spawning sites generally eastwards of it, where they were recaptured by commercial fishermen. The Park provides protection and undisturbed breeding sites for a portion of the spawning stock for part of the spawning period, and exports squid biomass through larval dispersal. It is unlikely that the Park markedly enhances the squid fishery, because spawning there is much less frequent than in open fishing areas.",

The filament carries nutrients and weakly motile biological organisms from the shelf zone towards the coastal transition zone, where eddies are observed. In order to probe the dynamics of the filament and its generating mechanism, a cruise was undertaken from 7 to 10 February 1996. At that time, there appeared to be a filament in retreat, following an upwelling episode. There were two apparent eddies beyond the shelf edge observed in the satellite-derived SST. The southern feature did not have a clear hydrographic structure, but the northern one did, and it appears to be a semi-permanent feature. The region is forced by a number of oceanic and meteorological boundary conditions, none of which is entirely predictable. One is the sporadic advection of warm water from the Agulhas Bank onto the southern shelf. The cruise took place following such an event. The anticipated shelf-edge jet was greatly diminished and forced inshore. The possible effect of barotropic shelf waves on the configuration of the upwelling tongue and the formation of filaments is discussed.",

The details of such an approach are developed. The approach involves deterministic forward projection of the biomass trajectory implied by each assessment for a period (e.g. 10 years) under the TACs or target levels of effort indicated by that and the other assessments. Within the framework developed, it is possible to allow for the effects of \"learning\" (i.e. updating parameter estimates as more data become available). The approach is relatively simple computationally and allows for quick and sometimes revealing comparisons between assessment/management procedures to be made. It is applied to the variety of assessments available for the stock of Cape hake off northern Namibia. The implication of the analyses conducted is that application of the f 0.1 harvesting strategy in combination with either the Spanish assessment procedure and the ICSEAF \"revised\" data set, or the South African assessment procedure using the Spanish OTB-8 data series, could lead to rapid resource depletion, so that use of these procedures would seem to be inappropriate for this stock.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen the rapid development of sophisticated, eddy-resolving models of ocean circulation. What has been missing thus far in creating realistic descriptions of ocean flows is the availability of sufficient synoptic data that can be incorporated into such models to initialize the models and keep their forward integration on track. Observation of the ocean from space provides such a possibility for assimilating the dynamic signal needed to steer the models towards reality and to allow oceanographers to create a synthesis and description of time-varying currents in a region of interest. The very large eddy signal present in the region south of South Africa makes that area ideal for studies of the assimilation of data derived from the Geosat (the U.S. Navy's geodetic satellite) altimeter. Maps of the eddy variability have been constructed over a few hundred days of the repeat orbit mission (December 1986 – February 1988) for data-assimilation purposes. The method of successive corrections was used to carry out the optimal interpolation from the track data to a regular ¼-degree latitude/ longitude grid. These data are then assimilated into a regional ocean model of the Agulhas Retroflection region. The model is a five-layer, ¼-degree horizontal resolution, quasigeostrophic model that covers the region from 20 to 54°S and from 2,5°W to 65°E, including the southern part of the African continent. Open lateral boundary conditions allow for inflows and outflows appropriate to this region. Numerical experiments, with and without assimilation of the altimeter data set, are carried out and a variety of assimilation techniques examined. The best of the results provides a four-dimensional description of the ocean circulation in the region for the time period covered.",

Prevalence of infection was high (15–50%) in Mugil cephalus, Liza richardsonii, L. tricuspidens, Valamugil buchanani and V. robustus, but low (<5%) in Myxus capensis, L. dumerilii and V. cunnesius. No infected L. alata or L. macrolepis were found. Intensity of infection was high (up to 19 worms) in M. cephalus but low (<4 worms) in the other mullet species. Infection was restricted to adult fish and prevalence increased with size of fish. The parasites recruited to fish annually during spring. Infection varied between estuaries. Mullet in the Kei Estuary had a lower prevalence of Grillotia than conspecifics in the Mbashe and Mntafufu estuaries, where infection patterns were similar. These differences are partly accounted for by regional variations in the abundance of the final hosts, the sharks Carcharhinus leucas and C. plumbeus. C. leucas is a new host for G. perelica. Inter- and intraspecific variations in infection of the mullet species are discussed in relation to their diet and spawning seasons and areas.",

The focus has been principally the biological interactions, although there has been an increasing tendency to consider technical interactions too. Most of the work on biological interactions has been carried out by two working groups — the ad hoc Working Group on Multispecies Assessment Methods and the ad hoc Multispecies Assessment Working Group. In this paper, a brief overview of the work of those groups is given, but with emphasis on the latter over the most recent years. The difficulties and problems of the assessment methods are highlighted as well as the progress and successes. The contrast between single-species and multispecies assessments and steady-state forecasts is made and the consequences for management decisions are discussed. It is concluded that, whereas multispecies management approaches might not yet be the all-powerful tools that many people imagine or hope for, they will, with suitable caution and communication, become routine vehicles for investigating fisheries management options.",

Whole and sectioned otoliths were used to determine the age of kingklip and the three-parameter Von Bertalanffy model to describe and compare growth. Greater availability and wider distribution of samples of larger fish, obtained from the demersal longline fishery, and more robust and advanced statistical analyses, have resulted in improved estimates of kingklip age and growth. Kingklip are relatively slow-growing and long-lived. Males on the South Coast (L ∞ = 130,1 cm; K = 0,149) attain larger size than males on the West Coast (L ∞ = 125,4 cm; K = 0,148). Female kingklip reach a greater size than males on either coast, though those on the West Coast (L ∞ = 132,9 cm; K = 0,135) have a slower growth rate and shorter maximum theoretical length than those on the South Coast (L ∞ = 141,5 cm; K = 0,138). The length : weight ratio of kingklip on the West Coast is greater than for fish on the South Coast. Differences in the growth rate and length: weight ratio between kingklip on each coast are not considered characteristic of discrete stocks or sufficient evidence alone to discriminate between stocks. Until other evidence of stock differences become apparent, the kingklip resource on the South African coast should be considered a single stock.",

Frond elongation rates showed marked seasonality, with optimum growth during the summer season. Regrowth of sheared tufts was much faster in the lower eulittoral zone. After 12 months there was no recruitment of G. pristoides in quadrats from which all visible plants had been removed, stressing the importance of vegetative regeneration in the short-term maintenance of natural populations after harvesting. The results lead to the following recommendations for commercial harvesting: (i) the period between successive harvestings should be sufficient for regrowth of individual tufts, (ii) excessive damage to the regenerative holdfast is to be avoided and (iii) harvesting should be limited to the lower eulittoral zone. Harvesting should coincide with the spring and summer seasons when frond elongation rates and regrowth after harvesting are maximal, to allow the optimum number of harvests per annum and to maximize the returns from the resource.",

Drogues were left to drift for either 6 or 24 h, while recording position and time. The majority of drogue movements were longshore, either eastward or westward; they usually travelled with similar direction and velocity. In most instances, westward movements were slightly offshore and were sometimes associated with a rise in the thermocline. Eastward movements were, on average, slightly slower, with an onshore component, sometimes associated with a lowering of the thermocline. The remaining trials showed some variability between drogues and were characterized by reduced velocity and unstable direction, indicating either the presence of horizontal turbulence or a current reversal. Current and wind were poorly correlated. Current directions were sustained for at least four days, indicating that short-lived ichthyoplankton, originating in the 70-km park, may be dispersed beyond its boundaries.Keywords: CURRENTSDROGUESLARVAL DISPERSALMARINE PROTECTED AREAS",

Autocorrelation statistics identify an irregular upwelling-downwelling cycle with periods of >20 days in winter; summers exhibit a faster 10-day pulsing. The average time between successive upwelling pulses is 23 days. Relationships between large-scale atmospheric Rossby wave structure and the local shelf response are analysed on the basis of selected hemispheric weather charts at the 500 hPa level. Cohesive hemispheric waves of length 8 000 km (Wave 4) contribute significant energy to the pulsing. The shorter westerly waves (5 and 6) induce rapid and less distinct oscillations.",

Despite the relative proximity of the sites, considerable temporal and spatial heterogeneity were evident. Although the major settlement of barnacles in undisturbed quadrats occurred in late winter (August–October), settlement intensity varied by up to two orders of magnitude, not only between sites but also between years. A heavy settlement of Tetraclita serrata in 1984 changed the structure of the community at two of the sites and reduced diversity. Recolonization of experimentally denuded rock was also found to be variable. In the upper balanoid, recruitment of the rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata was poor with no significant recovery recorded after 36 months. Although the lower balanoid was ultimately recolonized by barnacles, there was a delay of 15–24 months during which grazing gastropods were the dominant organisms. Recruitment patterns were different at each site, possibly reflecting differences in nearshore water movements. The rugged nature of the coast and the variability in population size and community structure found during this study preclude all but the broadest comparisons between sites and emphasize the need for continuous long-term monitoring in such systems.",

The factors responsible for these species successfully colonizing and dominating are examined with respect to their specific selective adaptations for growth. An attempt is made to determine the mechanism whereby these species dominated, by proposing several possible adaptations in terms of cell size, growth, nutrient absorption and buoyancy. Increase in cell size along the drogue trajectory is considered as a strategy in adapting to the changing environmental conditions.",

Measurements from small vessels were made by means of tracking drogues by GPS (sometimes differentially corrected) and by an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) when sampling from large vessels. The currents responded to the presence of Agulhas water, to wind-forcing and to barotropic shelf waves. The results suggest a marked seasonality in the position and amount of equatorward and poleward flow, which needs to be confirmed. Strong north-westward flow close inshore was measured in spring (August–October), turning into the \"classic\" formation of an equatorward jet, with variable barotropic flow inshore in early summer. In summer, circulation patterns became more complex, with marked southward flow. From February to April, the front was generally far offshore and often not encountered on the transect. Examples of the variability of the flow on a week-by-week basis are provided and are related to the thermal structure and to the wind record from Cape Point. The seasonality of the flow is summarized in terms of estimated mean surface transport per two-month period, and a series of northward and southward components for each cruise throughout the year is provided.",

The duration of Stages VII and VIII deviated most with temperature, varying from 2 to 13 hours over the temperature range of the experiment. Two models, an exponential and a power function, were assessed to describe the development of the stages in relation to temperature. At lower temperatures, the power function fitted the observed data better than did the exponential function, and it was therefore chosen as the appropriate model for ageing pilchard eggs.

Peculiarities of cephalopod life cycles and the fact that cephalopod fisheries can benefit from management experiences gained in other fisheries may help to preclude mistakes and management failures. During a three-day workshop, features of cephalopod biology, recommended areas of research and key conclusions for management were identified and points of differences between cephalopods and fish were highlighted. Among these, life-cycle understanding, spatial distribution, stock-recruitment relationship and age determination/growth studies were identified as key priorities for research. Physiological and genetic approaches to understanding basic aspects of the life cycle, and their importance for understanding population dynamics, were stressed. Similarly, theoretical ecology has a role to play in management, e.g. the role of a spatial distribution strategy in survival. Environmental studies are also emerging as being important in the possible prediction of population trends through links that operate at the level of spawning biology. In the interim, cephalopods can be managed using similar principles to those applied to short-lived fish species. Among these, constant proportion harvest strategies were identified as the most effective.",

However, many current fisheries models have only short-term datasets available, whereas those of suitable duration often lack reliability. As resources are placed under increasing pressure, all available information should be used to assist management. Two simple rule-based deterministic modelling approaches are described, which use semi-quantitative and qualitative rules to relate recruitment success of South African anchovy Engraulis capensis to physical and biological indices. The first model relates recruitment success to indices of wind and sea surface temperature by way of a rule-based decision support system. In the second model, significant environmental and biological factors were identified and related to anchovy recruitment by way of an expert system approach. These two approaches are evaluated and compared. It is suggested that these types of models, when satisfactorily validated, have great potential in supporting the future management of the South African anchovy fishery in the dynamic environment of the Benguela Current.",

Annual growth increments at Port Alfred were significantly smaller than at Agulhas Bank, St Francis and Port Elizabeth, but growth did not differ significantly between the last three areas. Growth models based on moult increment-at-size and intermoult period-at-size gave realistic descriptions of growth, but Von Bertalanffy L ∞ parameters underestimated observed maximum carapace lengths.

    "abstract": "There is much current interest in fisheries management policy which centres around the introduction of rights-based management systems, the devolution of control from central regulatory authorities, and the concept of co-management. In order to address the complexity of the last of these, key principles of co-management arrangements need to be identified. In the process of establishing these arrangements, rules and rights are redefined and new institutions are created for the management of common pool resources, where exclusion is costly and every resource harvester subtracts value from the harvest of the others. A preliminary analysis of co-management arrangements is presented that postulates the factors most important for their establishment, reference being made to the applicability of co-management in South African fisheries. As with other studies on management of common property resources, it is concluded that the definition of boundaries, both resource and human, are critical to the process. In addition, the rules governing participation and the allocation of costs and benefits need to be mutually agreed upon by all participants, and most importantly well defined, if successful arrangements are to be established.",

Together with studies conducted during summer (February 1991) and winter (May 1984), they serve to allow valuable generalizations of the biology and ecology of this abundant chaetognath. Populations migrate vertically and feed nocturnally, although the timing and the extent of migration vary between studies. S. friderici exhibits ontogenetic layering and the cross-shelf distribution of maturity stages differs, suggesting that it is able to take advantage of cross-shelf water movement in order to maintain populations in the nearshore waters of the West Coast. S. friderici prey almost exclusively on copepods (cannibalism is rare), and there is a positive relationship between the lengths of predator and prey that is influenced by the size structure of the prey environment. This casts doubt on the validity of a chaetognath species-specific relationship between predator and prey size. S. friderici selects its prey on the basis of size, and not species. Daily ration is related linearly to prey density, so reflecting the low density of prey and providing support for theoretical predictions regarding ingestion rates under oceanic conditions. The impact of S. friderici predation on the copepod assemblage is generally less than 3% of the standing stock, although it could be much higher under conditions of low copepod biomass and poor secondary production.",

Also considered is how the periodicity of the wind can be a more important factor in estimates of productivity than the integrated strength and duration of longshore wind. A suitable phase relationship between remotely generated coastal-trapped waves and local wind is a requirement for efficient upwelling.

The period was divided into three oceanographic seasons based on different levels of upwelling activity: late winter (August and September), spring (October–December) and summer (January–March). Cross-shelf and vertical distribution patterns of chlorophyll changed markedly during these seasonal periods, reflecting changes in hydrographic structure and in nutrient availability. During late winter, chlorophyll was evenly distributed in the deep, upper-mixed layer (>40 m) across the shelf. A clump-forming Thalassiosira sp. contributed to the moderately high mean chlorophyll concentration (1.9 mg·m−3) in the upper 30 m. In October and/or September, warming of surface waters inshore gave rise to a modest (2–5 mg·m−3) spring bloom, typical of the temperate zone. This was terminated in November by an influx across the shelf of warm, nutrient-impoverished water. Upwelling was sporadic and weak in spring. Summer was characterized by intense, episodic upwelling inshore, with pronounced cross-shelf thermal gradients, intensified by the presence of water of Agulhas origin along the shelf-edge. During an upwelling cycle, rapid hydrographic and biological changes occur over four phases: onset of upwelling, sustained upwelling, quiescence and downwelling. The upwelling productive zone, bounded by the 20°C isotherm, varied from <12 to 50 miles across the shelf. Chlorophyll was low in newly upwelled water (<0.5 mg·m−3) and attained peak concentrations in mature upwelled water (5–25 mg·m−3). Outside the productive zone, mean chlorophyll levels were low <0.5 mg·m−3). Enhanced phytoplankton growth during the spring bloom in September and/or October may be an important factor contributing to spawning success of pelagic fish in the southern Benguela.",

T. sarmaticus is harvested by recreational snorkel divers, and an application has been made for a permit to experimentally harvest the other two species commercially. This study involves four major aspects, namely morphometrics and flesh yield, shore-based abundance estimates, subtidal abundance estimates, and an estimate of the potential yield for each of the three species off the South-Western Cape, South Africa. Abundance and biomass of the winkles increased from west to east, highest densities being recorded in the low intertidal regions to 2 m depth. Low biomasses of the three species were recorded west of Cape Hangklip and are unlikely to support a fishery there. East of Cape Hangklip, invasion of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii has had a considerable impact on T. cidaris and O. sinensis populations. Consequently, a boat-based fishery with an estimated annual total allowable catch of 75.5 tons for T. cidaris, with a bycatch of 9.9 tons for O. sinensis, can only be considered in the easternmost fisheries-management area between Kleinbaai and Quoin Point. Because previous studies on the harvesting potential of T. sarmaticus off the Western Cape concluded that it was not commercially sustainable, a total allowable catch for that species was not considered. Management options deserving considerations before the commencement of a giant winkle fishery are discussed.

The population of rock lobsters in this region is crowded into a subtidal fringe within the kelp beds whereas, farther south, animals approaching sexual maturity tend to move offshore to deeper waters, so that adults are found in depths up to 70 m or more. Females attain sexual maturity at a smaller size in the Namaqualand region (and in Namibia) than farther south and growth rates of adults are retarded. Simulation models are used to show how stunted juvenile growth and increased rates of natural mortality can result in the typical size distributions observed in the Namaqualand region. This is contrasted with simulations for more typical grounds to the south, where growth rates of both adults and juveniles are faster. The models also illustrate the effects of reduced growth and survival on population fecundity, fecundity per recruit and yield per recruit, assuming constant average annual recruitment in all areas. The simulations demonstrate that overcrowding and stress, brought about by a diminution in the habitat area available to lobsters in the Namaqualand region, could have led directly to reduced production and yields. This region is characterized by the presence of very low levels of dissolved oxygen in waters near the sea bed just outside the kelp beds. Oxygen deficiency is thought to have increased in the central and northern Benguela system since the 1960s as a result of changes in the rate of phyto-detrital deposition and decay in this highly eutrophic system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current trap fishery for the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii in South African waters results in the capture, sorting and release of large numbers of undersized animals. Once removed from the water, they are vulnerable to damage from numerous sources. Even sub-lethal injury may result in a considerable reduction to individual productivity through decreased growth or reproductive potential. Given that the J. lalandii resource is heavily depleted, such wastage may have severe repercussions for the sustainability of the fishery. In an attempt to reduce these losses, 20% of the fishing gear used by the rock lobster industry has been modified to include grids designed to allow undersized rock lobsters (mainly females) to escape the traps before they are hauled. The efficiency of this gear (and two alternatives) was assessed by comparison with standard commercial gear over a range of fishing grounds. Results indicated that, in comparison to standard commercial traps, none of the alternative trap designs would be beneficial to the fishery in the long term, provided that overnight sets remain the most common fishing method. SELECT models were used to evaluate the fishing properties of commercial and bottom-grid traps relative to those of control (fine-mesh) traps. The results indicated that, given the choice, a rock lobster would preferentially enter a commercial trap, followed by a control trap, with bottom-grid traps being the least attractive. This suggests some level of saturation of control traps, a possibility that is of particular concern because the control trap design is used in a fishery-independent monitoring survey.

    "abstract": "The significance of the microheterotrophic community of bacteria and Protozoa in marine systems is reviewed. In surface waters, bacterial production may be linked to cycles of photosynthetically produced dissolved organic matter released from living phytoplankton. The bacteria then form a principal food resource for grazing Protozoa which are themselves potentially available for exploitation by higher trophic levels. Recent data suggest that the interaction between Protozoa and their bacterial prey may be a good deal more complicated than this simple predator-prey relationship implies. Ciliates may show either \"steady-state\" or strongly cyclical relationships with their bacterial prey, whose community may in turn be supported to a large extent by the release of dissolved organic matter by the ciliate population. This implies that the low standing stocks of bacteria commonly recorded in many pelagic systems may be sustained, as well as exploited, by bacterivorous Protozoa. In other systems, bacterial production may enter the larger zooplankton directly without involvement of the bacteria-Protozoa-bacteria loop. However, the microheterotrophic community of bacteria and Protozoa in general represents a competitive pathway down which a significant proportion of carbon from primary production may be channelled, compared with that flowing directly into the grazing zooplankton and thence to fish. Despite the high primary production which characterizes temporally unstable areas such as the southern Benguela upwelling system, the carrying capacity for fish may therefore be considerably less than that which might be anticipated for a simple herbivore-dominated food chain.",

The commercial catch increased from ± 10 tons in 1900 to 70 tons in 1940 when the data series was terminated. Between 10 and 70 per cent (27,5 per cent overall) of the total recorded number offish taken by sport anglers since 1938 were galjoen, and they were caught at a rate of 2–7 fish·100 h−1 and averaged between 950 and 1 400 g. Male and female stocks are assessed separately because they differed significantly in terms of numbers, size and rate of growth. The responses of yield per recruit (Y/R), spawning biomass per recruit (SB/R) and mean mass (W) to changing values of fishing (F) and natural (M) mortality and age at first capture (tc ) are modelled. The results reveal that the female stock is probably oyerexploited whereas the male stock is not and that, although sensitive to changes in tc and M, Y/R, SB/R and W are relatively unaffected by changes in F. Three management options are evaluated, and it is concluded that, given the limitations of the information available and that likely to be obtained in the near future, the present management package is probably the best compromise.",

Galjoen live in shallow, often very turbulent, waters where they feed mainly on sessile invertebrates such as bivalve molluscs and barnacles, and on amphipods and algae. The average size of fish sampled was 359 ± 59 mm total length, females, at 380 ± 62 mm, being significantly larger than males, at 349 ± 39 mm. Females grow faster than males, attaining some 550 mm or 3,3 kg at 12 years of age, whereas males of the same age reach only 440 mm or 1,5 kg. Fish of both sexes attain sexual maturity in their sixth year, at which stage females measure 340 mm and males 310 mm. Galjoen are serial spawners with a breeding season that extends from October to March, peaking in December. Mature females produce approximately 370 eggs per gramme of body mass at each spawning. The above data are used to assess the current conservation status of galjoen. The existing legislative package is seen as appropriate to management of this sought-after species.",

High abundance of birds and large body size (greater conspicuousness) tended to increase count precision, whereas ship-following behaviour decreased precision. Two main sources of imprecision were identified: failure to correctly categorize birds (in or out of the transect area, passing or following the ship) and failure to detect birds. Incorrect categorization could be avoided by adequate training. Biases caused by specific differences in detectability could be reduced by increasing vigilance and by making use of the best possible vantage.

Provisional data are presented on mesh selectivity of gill nets for harders. Management of the resource has been aimed at protecting juveniles, monitoring catches, limiting and phasing out of large-scale purse-seine fishing, limitation of excessive participation in the fishery, enforcement of human presence during fishing operations, and encouragement to diversify fishing effort. Despite the limited scientific knowledge of the resource, appropriate management action and such fortunate resource characteristics as seasonal fluctuation in availability, natural distribution over much of the coastline and a failure of the species to shoal along with other commercially exploited pelagic species have resulted in harvests remaining within the production capacity of the stock and in prevention of growth overfishing.",

Areas of coastal larval retention associated with capes in eastern boundary currents provide important spatial structure to coastal populations of fish and invertebrates through their influence on longshore settlement variability. Some patterns observed in the northern California Current for three meroplanktonic species groups (crabs, sea urchins and rockfish) relative to two such apparent retention features are synthesized. It is found that spatial variability in settlement of crabs is predictable at the scale of headlands. Apparent timing of upwelling intermittency and variability on weekly time-scales, as indicated by temperature change, is critical to interannual settlement variability. The average magnitude of upwelling, measured by an upwelling index, is by comparison a poor predictor of interannual settlement variability. Distribution of planktonic larvae relative to a nearshore retention feature is dependent on taxon. These nearshore retention features may act as reservoirs for some taxa or as conduits to the coast for others, likely depending on larval behaviour, timing and cross-shelf location of release relative to upwelling features. The longshore variability in recruitment created by the above patterns can result in differences in subpopulation productivity. For example, strength of a cohort of sea urchins varies longshore in accordance with proximity to retention features.",

As there is variability in the areas across which adult anchovy and sardine spawn, two contrasting egg distritutions were modelled for each species. Dissimilarities found between the two species can be attributable to (i) differences in egg distributions, and hence in the paths along which eggs and larvae are transported passively by currents, (ii) differences in survival rates of eggs and larvae, (iii) differences in duration of stages until swimming age and (iv) differences in the duration of the spawning season. In the absence of advective losses, more anchovy reached swimming age than did sardine. However, anchovy spawned in regions that are more susceptible to advective losses. Adult biomass levels were low in the years when anchovy and sardine spawning was restricted to the South Coast. Also, advective losses of both species were greater when spawning distributions were contracted. Higher proportions of young reached the West Coast when spawning extended over the South and up the West coasts. Sardine accumulated farther west than anchovy. Anchovy eggs and larvae were lost to advection mainly on the South Coast between Cape Agulhas and Mossel Bay, whereas advective losses of sardine were restricted to areas west of the Cape Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of catches of Loligo gahi around the Falkland Islands in the years 1982-1986 initially suggested a simple population structure with one stock peaking in the fishery in autumn and another peaking in spring. Management of two seasons was therefore imposed in 1987. This pattern has proved highly variable, with the result that, for some years, it seems as if up to four cohorts are present in two separated northern and southern fishing areas. In this paper, evidence from fishing vessel and scientific observer data is examined for these different population structures. The conclusion is that the simplest structure that fits the observed data is of two main cohorts recruiting during a year to a single fishing area, albeit with considerable geographic heterogeneity, with a smaller recruitment episode sometimes present at the end of the year. The recruitment of these cohorts to the fishery is not, however, coincident with current management seasons.",

Eight teleost species important in anglers' catches in the South-Western Cape together provided nearly 60% of the total juvenile catch, of which Rhabdosargus globiceps (22,8%) and Pomatomus saltatrix (20,3%) were the most abundant. Mean juvenile catch per haul for all species was 125 individuals, mean annual catches of juvenile teleosts so amounting to approximately 74 000 individuals. Juvenile teleosts constitute <6% of the total beach-seine catch in False Bay, considerably smaller than the proportion of juveniles in other South African commercial and recreational fisheries. When compared to published estimates of natural mortality for juvenile teleosts frequenting nearshore sandy beach habitats, potential seine-net mortality was calculated to be insignificant for most of the species considered. However, estimated annual catches of juvenile Lithognathus lithognathus make up a significant proportion (>30%) of the total surf-zone standing stocks, and it is thought that juveniles of this species in False Bay may be under considerable threat because they are also caught in large numbers by shore-anglers.",

Of the many environmental variables which, potentially, may give an indication of future recruitment, the fundamental physical indices of sea surface temperature and wind were selected for inclusion in the model. From simple regression and correlation analysis, qualitative rules were constructed relating recruitment success to wind frequency, wind velocity and sea surface temperature in one or more of the spawning, transport and recruitment (nursery) areas of the anchovy. By calibration of the rules, and the consideration of annual spawner biomass, it was possible to obtain a good estimate of observed recruitment. The model was then used to examine the implications of a number of possible environmental scenarios on annual recruitment. Results from the statistical analyses and those from the model indicate that transport of larvae may be one of the dominant components of the Benguela system that affects anchovy recruitment. Furthermore, simulated recruitment emphasizes the high within-season variation in recruitment.",

    "abstract": "The conceptual framework for quantitative marine ecology is attributable to Victor Hensen (1887), who proposed that quantitative studies of plant and animal production in the sea would permit predictions of annual fish yields. Hensen was strongly influenced by concurrent conceptual developments in agriculture, in which crop production was being predicted from knowledge of physiology and its relationship to environmental variables. As fish were being \"harvested\" by man, it was argued that relationships similar to agriculture existed between primary production and fish yield. Thus was born the notion that pelagic ecosystems were structured from the \"bottom-up\", or resource-limited. Subsequent refinements argued that, from basic knowledge of how vertical mixing regulates primary production, and assuming certain features of food-chain length and efficiency, one can estimate fish yields. Fundamental to these arguments are assumptions concerning resource limitation which appear to be uncertain as generic marine pelagic characteristics, primarily that trophic levels are nutrient/food limited and respond to increased resource availability by elevated standing stocks. Whereas this conceptual model explains certain features of energy flow, it fails to describe how marine pelagic foodwebs are structured and why they function as they do. Rather, it appears that certain taxa are better than others at integrating their environments and regulating the flux of materials through the foodweb, and that predation is as important as resource limitation. There appears to be a distinct need in pelagic research to focus on predation, not as a rate process so much as a mechanism responsible for organism behaviour, morphology, life history and community structure.",

The formalism for tuning the latter set of mortalities with effort data from one or more participating fleets is presented, and procedures for estimating the variance of the resultant solution for Laurec-Shepherd tuning are proposed. These methods are applied to the stock of Cape horse mackerel off Namibia. Overall biomass trends are poorly determined. A multiple-fleet disaggregated-data VPA for the Polish and Soviet effort series estimates the 1989 F 0.1 Total Allowable Catch (TAC) to be a little in excess of 700 000 tons, with an associated negatively biased 95-per-cent confidence interval estimate of [220; 3 500] thousand tons. This enormous imprecision suggests that F 0.1 TAC estimation based on a VPA should be abandoned as the basis for management recommendations for the resource. A replacement-yield harvesting strategy is advocated as an interim measure; the associated TAC estimated would be 517 (SE 19) thousand tons using data on catch per unit effort and estimated average biomass from VPA. A status-quo F harvesting strategy, and the possibilities for direct surveys of the resource, merit consideration.",

The establishment of communities was characterized by seasonal succession, colonization rates being lowest during winter. Community development differed between depths. At 10 m, barnacles appeared first but numerous mussels settled on them, eventually smothering them. Later, secondary settlement of barnacles on the mussels increased the bulk of the layer. Initial development was slower at the 20 m site, progressing from barnacle dominance to a more complex community including barnacles, serpulids, hydrozoans and compound ascidians. The settlement of solitary ascidians during summer led to their final dominance alongside barnacles. It is suggested that solitary ascidians and barnacles would normally dominate at sublittoral depths up to 20 m in False Bay, except where mussel dominance develops first.",

Occurrence of these stages is highly seasonal: they are found in summer off the Western Cape and mainly from late summer to winter in Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape, possibly reflecting longitudinal migration. Large numbers of late juveniles and adults are often found downstream of upwelling plumes off the Western Cape when warmer waters lie close inshore. They are sometimes taken in purse-seines in association with adult round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi and pilchard Sardinops ocellatus. Important predators of late juvenile and adult saury are fast-moving, surface-feeding species: yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, Cape gannet Morus capensis and Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea. Cape gannets consume an estimated 2 277–6 044 tons of saury annually in South African waters.

The presence of a red-tide bloom of the dinoflagellate Ceratium furca provided the opportunity to examine the conditions required for the development of such an event. Hydrographic parameters indicated the intrusion of warm oceanic water adjacent to St Helena Bay whereas, within the Bay, aged upwelled water was evident following relaxation of upwelling and stabilization of the water column. C. furca was recorded in surface waters at a concentration of 1,3 × 106 cells·ℓ−1 and productivity estimates exceeded 500 mgC·m−3·h−1. Productivity indices were lowest within the red-tide bloom, indicating that the dominance of C. furca cannot be explained by rapid growth. The bloom appears rather to represent the accumulation of slow-growing ungrazed populations subject to concentration by physical entrainment and vertical migration. Phytoplankton succession is less likely to be disrupted in St Helena Bay because water masses are retained there for longer periods than outside the Bay. The prevalence of late successional forms such as dinoflagellates is therefore more likely within the Bay.",

The river experiences peak flooding from February through June, with the 375-km long floodplain extending up to 5 km across. The floodplain was sampled five times in 1992 by seine, fish traps and rotenone. The data indicated a pronounced structural and functional response of the fish community in relation to the alternating flood and drought conditions in the river. Catch per unit effort and diversity were highest during months of peak flooding (May and June), and lowest during the month of least flow (November). The reproductive strategies of K-selected piscivorous cichlids and tigerfish were in advance of flooding. Many r-selected invertivores, especially cyprinids, were in relative synchrony with flooding and the stimulation of littoral zone plant growth, while other invertivores lagged the cyprinids. Herbivores had lowest relative abundance during peak flooding; this seemingly inverse relationship with the invertivores should not be interpreted as replacement, but rather the swamping of the system with young-of-the-year r-selected invertivores. The data support the Flood Pulse Concept, which hypothesizes that flooding is the major \"driver\" of productivity in lowland or floodplain rivers.",

The probability that such predation will occur when an encounter takes place in a laboratory tank is dependent on relative predator and prey size and on the abundance of alternative prey. This attempt to apply laboratory observations to the field employs a model based on best available estimates of predation probability, predator search rate and food consumption rate, predator and prey growth rates and rate of prey total mortality. For simplicity, it was assumed that predator and prey stages are distributed randomly with respect to each other or that patches of predator and prey are distributed randomly. Alternative food was set at 2,25 mg dry mass·m−3.The model predicted that all predator anchovy up to 35 mm SL (completion of metamorphosis) would account for only about I percent of total daily mortality of prey stages between spawning and 20 days post-hatch. Juvenile anchovy between 35 and 50 mm SL were predicted to account for 3–6 per cent of mortality of those prey stages. Situations that would lead to increased levels of cannibalism are discussed.",

The data set is now the largest on record for any southern continent other than Antarctica. It provides an opportunity to examine the biological significance of such matters as seasonality, possible causes of haul-out, their possible origins and implications for interpretation of elephant-seal dispersal around their breeding colonies. The number of sightings has increased recently. The overall sex ratio is 52,4 per cent male to 21 per cent female, 26,6 per cent being of indeterminate sex. The seals haul out mainly from November to February, and indications are that males and females disperse straight after the breeding season and a few months later reach the coast of southern Africa. The most likely primary cause of haul-out for immature seals is to moult. It is postulated that the seals originated mainly from South Georgia. It is not clear if the seals recorded are true vagrants or the outer fringe of a normal dispersal. Of the sightings, 24 were tagged after arrival, and of these, 13 were sighted more than once and 6 showed a regular pattern of movement. There were 19 sightings of elephant seals at local fur-seal rookeries and, with one exception, the two species co-existed peacefully. There are three confirmed and two unconfirmed births on the coast. The ability to develop a preference for unfamiliar places and to pup outside their natal colonies could explain how they colonize new areas.",

Catch and effort data from the trawl fishery for the period 1978–1996 are used to obtain annual estimates of catch rate (catch per unit effort cpue) for that period. Examination of the cpue trend shows a sharp decline in the early 1980s and, in order to identify factors that could have influenced that decline, the distribution of fishing effort is investigated both temporally and spatially. There is a possible change in the incidence of squid-directed catches over time, but their overall scarcity could have had only a small impact on the annual cpue trend. Further, using distribution of fishing effort to evaluate the effects of possible changes in fishing patterns, rather than changes in resource abundance, on the trend in trawl cpue, it became clear that there had been a contraction of the trawling grounds and changes in fishing patterns in relation to depth over time. Finally, a general linear model (GLM) is developed to quantify the effect on cpue of factors such as vessel characteristic, depth and position of the drag, season and target species, so obtaining a standardized trawl cpue index of chokka abundance. Analysis of that trend reveals a mean 7.7% annual decline for the period investigated, which should be interpreted as a strong sign of resource decline.",

Multivariate analyses indicated a clear separation between shelf and slope habitats, which were divided into three and two assemblages respectively. These divisions were distinct, with clear distributional boundaries separating them. Species determining the structure of these divisions and subdivisions and their relative abundances were identified. Depth, bottom temperature, bottom salinity and dissolved oxygen were all significantly correlated with the spatial distribution of the assemblages. Minor changes or shifts in the distribution of assemblages were observed over the study period, although patterns of species associations remained relatively constant.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA new species of electric ray of the genus Narcine Henle, 1834 is described from seven specimens collected from two localities off the western coast of Madagascar, in the Moçambique Channel. Narcine insolita, sp. nov. is distinguished from all other species of the genus by the unique presence of a very prominent first dorsal fin that is much greater than the second dorsal fin in both height and length of base. A unique combination of characters further distinguishes N. insolita, including large and bulging eyes, large circular spiracles with elevated rims, interorbital distance much greater than interspiracular distance, rounded cusplets lateral to principal cusp on teeth of inner tooth rows, broadly rounded tooth bands, dorsal colouration composed of a yellowish brown background with large dark brown to reddish brown blotches at disc margins and over dorsal and caudal fins, and numbers of precaudal and total vertebral centra. N. insolita is similar but distinct from the recently described Narcine oculifera from the Gulfs of Oman and Aden, with which it is compared. An additional specimen of Narcine from the coast of Moçambique also presents features in common with our new species. However, it is not currently included in N. insolita, because it lacks its autapomorphic dorsal fin proportions. This specimen probably represents a further undescribed species of Narcine from the south-western Indian Ocean, but more specimens from Moçambique are required for further evaluation. The new species represents only the third described species of Narcine from the western Indian Ocean.Keywords: MOCAMBIQUE CHANNELNARCINENEW SPECIESNUMBFISHSOUTH-WESTERN INDIAN OCEANTAXONOMY",

However, it was an insignificant component of the catch on the north coast of that region. A seasonal trend in the catch of S. salpa was evident, with a marked increase in catches during winter. The current status of S. salpa off the coast of KwaZulu/Natal was assessed in terms of yield-per-recruit and spawner-biomass-per-recruit analyses. Instantaneous natural and total mortalities were estimated to be 0,6 and 1,41·year−1 respectively. A fishing mortality of 0,81·year−1, which is the current level on S. salpa, appears to be appropriate for utilization of the stock.

    "abstract": "To obtain a first estimate of the potential impact of density-dependent regulation by cannibalism and by inter-specific predation by a guild species (pilchard) on anchovy population growth, a simple model based on a Leslie matrix was constructed. Simulations in which the pilchard biomass was held at 0 and the anchovy biomass increased, demonstrated that the eigenvalue decreased linearly from 1,03 at 1 000 tons to 0,94 at 2 million tons, showing a potential density-dependent mechanism for population regulation. The impact of pilchard on anchovy population growth depended on the assumed clearance rate. At the maximum biomass tested (2 million tons of pilchard) the eigenvalue of the anchovy Leslie matrix varied from 0,91 to 0,36, depending on the anchovy biomass and the pilchard clearance rate used. Field evidence indicates that the fastest clearance rate tested may be the most realistic of the three options. The model assumed uniform distribution of eggs in the spawning area, but the results are sensitive to the simulated concentration of eggs. Therefore, the actual patterns of spatial distribution of both eggs and anchovy and pilchard adults would have a major impact on the extent of egg consumption. The results indicate that egg consumption is potentially an important intra- and interspecific mechanism causing population fluctuations.",

The comparisons were based on 53 cruises from nine seasonal surveys during the periods 1972–1974 and 1978–1985. Within the spawning grounds there were two localities of main reproductive activity, associated with different hydrographic features and differing spawning strategies. Between 22 and 24°S, a locality in which there is usually only a thin layer of oxygen-rich water above the shallow thermocline (<20 m), heavier spawning was associated with moderate thermal stratification in the upper 20 m, and there was little spawning when stratification was either absent or extensive for a long period. Between the Cunene River and 22°S, a locality where the upper mixed layer of well-oxygenated water is often 100 m thick, the presence or absence of thermal stratification in the upper 20 m did not apparently affect spawning. During the El Niño-type event, when nutrient concentrations, even deep in the water, were low and strong stratification was prevalent over a large area for several months, spawning was reduced. Variation in egg distribution in relation to salinity and temperature could be explained by differences in the locality and the timing of spawning during the three regimes. Pilchard and anchovy spawned mainly in water with salinities of 35,1 – 35,6 × 10−3 and temperatures at 20 m of 13–19°C.",

In an attempt to evaluate and quantify the effect of seals on the industry, questionnaires were distributed to skiboat clubs in and near Cape Town. Between February 1988 and May 1992, 193 returns were received from the Western and South-Western Cape. From the 167 returns analysed for this paper, it was clear that just two species (hottentot and snoek) were the main targets of the fishery. Losses to seals of these two species amounted to 1,5 and 3,0 per cent respectively. Losses were highest in November (8,4%) for hottentot and in August (11,4%) for snoek, whereas in January and April there were no losses of either species.

    "abstract": "The size-related activities of important heterotrophs and autotrophs were compared at the surface and at the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (Chlmax) in Agulhas Bank waters. The netplankton fraction was dominated by Nitzschia spp. and ciliates, small (diameter c. 3μm) microflagellates being the most abundant nanoplankton group. Uptake ratios of ammonium to phosphate for the total microplankton community were different at the two depths. With reference to the Redfield ratio, it appears that at least 48 per cent of the nitrogen ration at the Chlmax was regenerated even though nitrate was in ample supply. These assimilation ratios also suggest a very large contribution from recycled nitrogen other than ammonium in surface waters. It is unlikely that phosphorus would ever become limiting, except perhaps at the primary production maximum. Microplankton uptake and regeneration of both ammonium and phosphorus were approximately in balance, indicating that variations in assimilation ratios were the result of heterotrophic excretory activity. The size-fractionation studies show that picoplankton were on average the single most important size class in nutrient assimilation. The netplankton size class was, in terms of regeneration, often the most active in the microplankton community especially within the Chlmax. Heterotrophic microflagellates and picoplankton supplied the bulk of ammonium and phosphorus at the surface. The importance of a particular size class to either ammonium or phosphorus uptake/excretion was quantified as a relative assimilation/regeneration index. These calculations demonstrate size-related differences in the relative importance of the microplanktonic groups to the immobilization and recycling of different nutrients.",

The biomass in three such areas, where most commercial fishing occurs (the Johnies, Frankies and Rix Quota Management Areas, or QMAs) has been assessed acoustically each year since 1997. Acoustic estimates of the aggregated portion of the biomass (the only component that can be assessed reliably using acoustics) were obtained for all three QMAs in 1997 and 1998, but only for Frankies in 1999 owing to increased problems with target identification as the biomass declined. The methodology developed for these surveys, including the equipment used, survey design, target identification, data processing and error analysis are described. Some important biases that should be corrected for when estimating absolute abundance of orange roughy acoustically are addressed. Individual sources of error were quantified as well as possible, and input to an error model that simulated the error process and produced probability density functions of absolute biomass, from which the mean absolute biomass and its standard error could be computed for each survey, effectively correcting for identified sources of bias and quantifying the overall uncertainty. The correction factors ranged from 1.58 to 1.71 and the CVs increased by factors of 1.2–2.1. Target strength uncertainty and negative bias attributable to the dead zone close to the bottom were considered to be the most serious errors. The acoustic estimates indicate a substantial decline in orange roughy biomass in all three QMAs since 1997, in accord with indices from contemporaneous swept-area surveys and the catch rate of the commercial fleet. Acoustic estimates have already been used extensively to manage the resource and are likely to remain important in the future.",

The origins of the major red algal component of the West Coast flora appear to be in temperate and polar regions of the southern Pacific Ocean, whereas the South and East Coast floras are more closely related to the floras of the tropical Indian Ocean and of South and West Australia. Although the West Coast flora has a high degree of endemism, recent evidence suggests that events since the initiation of the Benguela system < 12 million years ago have been crucial in its formation. Evidence on the effects of upwelling on growth and physiology suggests that rapid irregular fluctuations in temperature and nutrients on the West Coast have little effect on the strongly seasonal patterns of development, which are probably brought about by aspects of the light regime. Variations in light intensity in the sublittoral caused by upwelling or downwelling conditions appear to have relatively minor effects on seaweed production. Little is known of the effects of high concentrations of available nutrients in upwelled water, although the kelp Ecklonia maxima appears to have evolved both morphologically and physiologically to the West Coast conditions.",

The mean heterozygosity was generally low and ranged from 0.003 to 0.005. Genetic divergences between specimens from four areas along the west coast of southern Africa were negligible, genetic distance values (D) ranging from 0 to 0.00011. The results showed the population of L. hectoris to be genetically invariant. Principal Component Analysis was performed separately on ratios of 13 morphometric and 6 meristic variables (n = 446), and there was evidence of extensive overlap between fish from all areas. However, discriminant analysis suggested some morphological variability within this population. Although genetically the population of L. hectoris seems to be homogenous, morphologically it appears to be variable. A combination of these results suggests that there is no clear genetic basis for the slight morphological differentiation within the population.",

Subsieves ranged from 2,1 to 7,7 per cent. Organic matter was in the range 1,5–2,6 per cent and porosity 21,6–33,9 per cent. Permeability was correlated with grain size. The less exposed sediments of Kings Beach had much higher chlorophyll a and phaeopigment values, but supported a poorer benthic diatom population than did the sediments of the Sundays River beach. Nutrient levels in both the sea and the sediment were high. The pH and oxygen saturation decreased with depth into the sediment, but no anoxic conditions were encountered. Meiofaunal biomass, to a depth of 60 cm, averaged 1 119 and 656 mg·m−2 at Kings and Sundays River beaches respectively. Nematodes dominated virtually throughout, whereas harpacticoid copepod numbers were low. Bacterial numbers ranged from 12 × 106 to 130 × 106·cm−3, and at both beaches increased in an offshore direction. Bacterial biomass averaged 6 197 and 5 234 mg·m−2 at Kings and Sundays River beaches respectively. Significant numbers of meiofauna and bacteria were still encountered in the 50–60 cm depth layer and it was therefore concluded that use of long cores when sampling in high energy systems is essential.",

Although these recent data are potentially biased, and often lack estimates of precision, it is argued that they are sufficient to demonstrate general trends.

A deepening of the moist unstable layer was indicated by increased equivalent potential temperatures over the warm side. Most significantly, convectively generated turbulence, as inferred from variances in air pressure, increased exponentially with sea surface temperature and surface layer winds doubled south of 35°S. The sea state, initially smooth over the continental shelf, became rough seawards of the northern edge of the Agulhas Current. Numerical model simulations were performed to assess air-sea interactions. Model-simulated thermodynamic variables responded in close agreement with observations, but the increase in cross-frontal winds was not fully resolved.

    "abstract": "A network of six NO3-N-driven carbon pathways between the ocean, shelf and sediments was described in a paper published in 1992. A budgetary approach at the annual scale meant that, if three of the pathways were quantified, solutions could be found algebraically for those remaining. The network of pathways in the present study remains unchanged in principle, but in respect of long-term carbon sequestration, there has been a shift in emphasis from ocean to continental shelf. This results from an adjusted estimate for carbon exported seawards of the continental shelf, mainly owing to a re-examination of the typical offshore penetration of upwelling-derived water. Whereas the 1992 paper used a study based on grey-scale contrast, from Meteosat imagery, to designate a region up to and occasionally beyond the 2 000 m isobath where water of upwelling origin was present on a quasi-permanent basis, the present study used actual sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from NOAA imagery and found comparatively little water <17°C beyond the 350 m isobath. This adjustment has important implications for the quantification of offshore potential new production calculated from the derived relationship between SST and NO3-N integrated over the nominal euphotic zone. The proportion of southern Benguela new production thought to be sequestrated at time-scales which constitute a long-term loss to the system remains at 70%, but it is now proposed that approximately 66% is incorporated in continental shelf sediments and 4% is lost below the offshore permanent thermocline. The remaining 30% is re-cycled over shorter time-scales within the southern Benguela system.",

In all, 19 loci, encoding 14 allozymes, were resolved for 40 specimens. Three loci (15,8%) were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity for the population corresponded with values determined for other delphinid populations. However, the heterozygous state of the enzyme G6PD was only found in female bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that this enzyme may be X-linked in delphinids. Cluster analysis indicated a trend towards a north-south dichotomy in the KwaZulu/Natal population, a result supported by previously reported pollutant data as well as greater variability and smaller genetic distances in the southern cluster. However, non-significant FST values implied a lack of true genetic structure in the KwaZulu/Natal population. It is proposed that the annual influx of bottlenose dolphins from the Eastern Cape coast, in response to the migration of pilchard Sardinops sagax, results in the capture of dolphins \"resident\" on the KwaZulu/Natal south coast as well as Eastern Cape \"migrants\". Genetic variation between two potentially distinct populations may contribute to the elevated variability in the \"resident\" dolphins and the weak structuring of the KwaZulu/Natal population. Small sample sizes did not permit the evaluation of structure between \"preferred areas\" within KwaZulu/Natal.",

The population dynamics of the species was investigated in order to provide some insight into the mechanisms involved in maintaining such concentrations of unusually large individuals in the region. It is postulated that bottom topography and coastline orientation determine a semi-enclosed circulation pattern, characterized by reduced upwelling, strong stratification of the water column and convergence. In this environmental scenario, N. capensis would benefit from the relatively high and less variable (compared to other areas) phytoplankton concentrations derived from this circulation pattern. The hypothesis is that this adequate environment would result in longer residence times of N. capensis and would increase its reproductive rates. Selected past and new observations are presented and discussed in relation to this hypothesis. The role of the poleward flow that typically develops over the shelf between January and April in transporting new individuals into the region, and the dispersal of early reproductive products in the wind-driven upper layer, are also discussed.",

Experimental animals were selected for consistent feeding and subsequently starved for 72 h. Ingested carbon was established by determining the carbon content of the prey mussel Choromytilus meridionalis under controlled aquarium conditions through five eating/defaecating cycles. The losses of particulate and dissolved organic carbon due to messy feeding were measured and amounted to 20,1 per cent of the food presented. Of the net carbon ingested, 20,5 per cent was voided as faeces, thereby giving a mean absorption efficiency of 79,5 per cent (n = 15, SD = 4,6%). J. lalandii, as a top carnivore in the inshore Benguela ecosystem, is therefore highly efficient in the utilization of ingested carbon. In animals of commercial size (≥ 89 mm carapace length), small variations in absorption efficiencies exhibited were neither dependent on body mass nor ingested mass, but may rather be attributed to scatter inherent in all biological systems.",

Growth in length was rapid in immature fish, fish attaining 56% of their maximum size within their first year. By sexual maturity, fish had attained 28% of their maximum age and 68% of their maximum length. Total length-at-age was best described by the Von Bertalanffy growth model with combined-sex growth described as Lt = 354.78(1−e−0.43 (t+1.17)) mm TL. Sexually dimorphic growth patterns were evident, females attaining larger lengths, but at a slower growth rate than males. Despite the similar mean size of adult fish, the trawl-sampled adult population was dominated by females, with a sex ratio of 1 male:2.4 females. Female C. zanzibarensis mature in their second year of life (275 mm TL), after which they spawn small, pelagic eggs throughout the year. Approximations of the rates of total, natural and fishing mortality were estimated to be 0.62, 0.48 and 0.14 year−1 respectively.",

Variability in early-stage survival is introduced into the models by means of both random and non-random (\"red\") spectra. Traits exhibited by lanternfish are shown to be inefficient in filtering out random variability and the species therefore cannot prevent collapse in a non-randomly variable environment. By comparison, the traits found in anchovy and hake filter out part of both random and non-random variability in survival and allow a fairly stable population size to be maintained. It is argued that, as life-history traits are adapted to the spectrum of variability associated with the habitat, only anomalies with respect to this spectrum are likely to have a large influence on stock size.",

It is argued that the female stock of the Western Cape is currently recruitment-overfished with F≫F MSY , although the possibility that the stock is not recruitment-overfished is also considered. Simulated catch-at-age data for a variety of values of F show an insensitivity to the degree of stock depletion, a phenomenon ascribed to a strong size-selectivity effect. Closed-season and minimum-size options were evaluated against three possible effort-catch-rate (E-cpue) relationships, ranging from effort being independent of catch rate (cpue) to effort being entirely dependent on it. The present closed season of four months is ineffective at improving catches and counterproductive in that it reduces effort. The reasons for this failure are, first, that the closed season is at a time when galjoen are less \"catchable\" and, second, that, depending on the E-cpue relationship, fish not caught during the closed season attract additional effort during the open season. By contrast, the minimum size limit is extremely effective by increasing both yield and effort substantially, a result which is robust to differing E-cpue relationships and to the shape of the recruitment curve.",

A method was developed and tested to establish catchability constants for trawl surveys of Namibian hake Merluccius spp. A catchability constant can be expressed as a simple relationship between hake area densities calculated from trawl catches and acoustic biomass estimates. Initial values were on an order of magnitude of 0.8, meaning that the catch takes 80% of the hake available to the trawl. The methodology depends on careful area selection (flat bottom, homogenous fish distribution), following the same trawl lane during subsequent hauls in an area, and thorough acoustic post-processing. A pronounced and repetitive pattern in catchability within surface daylight hours was found. Early morning and early afternoon catches were low, and the best catches of the day were made around noon, a result that may influence stock assessments based on trawl data, because morning and afternoon data would under-represent actual abundance.",

These biases may, however, not be serious provided that estimates of abundance are used to reflect relative changes in the biomass dynamics of the population. The age-structured production model, tuned to trends in General-Linear-Modelling-standardized catch-per-unit-effort data and relative abundance indices calculated from hake (Merluccius spp.) biomass surveys, together with observed commercial and survey catches-at-age, showed similar trends.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rates of tag-shedding are determined for monel-metal tags applied to fore-flippers of 21 799 pups of the South African fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus in 12 colonies in the years 1971 and 1973–1979. Half of the pups (alternate ones) were tagged on both fore-flippers. The major aim of the study was to estimate pup population size by mark-recapture. Collection of tags from pups killed in harvests 5–9 months after tagging permitted rates of tag-shedding to be determined. For 10 different taggers, this averaged 0,149 (SE 0,0053), and ranged from 0,068 to 0,338 for individual taggers. Because it is easier to apply a tag to one fore-flipper than the other, the rates of tag-shedding are likely to be inflated over what they would be if all pups were given a single tag applied to the flipper of choice. The variation between taggers indicates that greater efforts should be made to standardize tagging procedures. The average rate of tag-shedding was similar to that reported for Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii in their first year and for young northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (although age-classes and time periods for the latter species were different). The high rate of tag-shedding within the first year of life highlights the need to include this parameter when estimating survival rates based on tagged animals.",

The first is the recognition of the limited information content for assessment purposes of the available data for many of the Benguela's major pelagic and demersal resources. This has meant that management measures for these resources could attempt no more than to maintain the status quo, rather than to achieve \"optimal\" utilization. Secondly, a post mortem on the commercial extinction of the kingklip suggests a need to consider Bayesian methods as a means to incorporate additional information into stock assessments. Finally, changes to the management approaches for the hake and anchovy fisheries are argued to have been particular successes, notwithstanding the recent heavily reduced Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the latter resource. \"Management procedures\" have been developed and simulation-tested for these two resources. The implications of this approach for the future basis, whereby TACs are set for South Africa's fisheries, are discussed.",

Field data were obtained on a monthly basis during the anchovy spawning season as part of the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Programme (SARP). A total of six indicator variables was considered for the analysis: distance offshore of the 16°C isotherm; southerly wind stress; anchovy egg abundance; incidence of oocyte atresia in adult females; an index of fish starvation; and oil: meal ratios obtained from commercial data (which were used as an index of fish condition). In the model, data for each variable were assessed against a threshold value. \"Active\" variables were assumed to contribute towards below-average recruitment by being either above or below their threshold values, as defined by the rules. The model was not based on the SARP field data, which were used to test the model. Predicted results from the expert system compared favourably with final estimates of recruitment strength for both 1994 and 1995 (years of below average recruitment), indicating that field measurements of biological and environmental variables may be used in a structured manner to obtain forecasts of anchovy recruitment to the fishery.",

In view of the size-related variability in capture probability between individuals and the low capture probability of most individuals, the Chao model was considered to yield the most reliable estimates of population size. Crab densities were estimated to be 225 m2·crab−1 or 0,444 crabs·100 m−1 at Mhlanga and 188 m2·crab−1 or 0,532 crabs·100 m−2 at Msimbazi. Probable sources of bias are an increase in the capture probability of crabs during the four-day experiment at Mhlanga and inadequate overlap between the areas of influence of adjacent traps. Asymptotic curves of the form C t = C ∞(1−e−βt ) were fitted to catch data from the two estuaries. Asymptotic catch C ∞ was higher and the rate at which it was reached (β) was lower in the more densely populated estuary. A possible relationship between these parameters and crab density is discussed.",

Also, the growth rate of recruits was slower in 1989 than in 1985. It is proposed that the very weak 1989 year-class of anchovy and the low spawning biomass subsequently observed were a result of poorer-than-average egg production and survival of prerecruits spawned after October 1988, and the slow rate of growth of juvenile anchovy recruited till June 1989.",

    "abstract": "Thermal infra-red satellite imagery and ship-borne studies of 15N stable isotopes are used to provide a first estimate of the quantity of carbon exported from the Benguela upwelling system during summer 1983/84. From satellite imagery, a region where cold water of upwelling origin was present on a quasi-permanent basis and a more offshore region where the presence of such water was intermittent were designated. New production inside the 200 m isobath was excluded from the calculations because an unknown proportion of it may be recycled within the continental shelf system and would not therefore constitute export production and hence potential sequestration. Total production can be apportioned between new and regenerated production depending on the relative utilization of NO3–N or NH4–N and urea respectively. New production generally results from the input of NO3–N to the euphotic zone via upwelling and/or turbulent diffusion and is the only portion of the total production which, in the long term, constitutes a carbon sink. This principle is modified to address the problem of possible new-production recycling on the continental shelf on short time-scales. Nitrate-uptake experiments conducted in the euphotic zone of aged upwelled and filament water throughout the Benguela yielded values of new production, and the mean of these data was applied to the appropriate areas identified by satellite imagery. New production off the continental shelf during summer 1983/84 attributable to upwelling-derived water was 2,14 × 1013 ± l,77 × 1013 g. An attempt is made to place this value in the context of new-production pathways in the Benguela.",

This horizontal pattern is described and the mechanisms producing the pattern at Glencairn in False Bay are examined. Survival rates of Tetraclita were significantly higher in Tetraclita-dominated areas than in Octomeris-dominated areas, whereas survival rates of Octomeris were higher in Octomeris-dominated areas. Five hypotheses to explain differences in survival were examined. There was no support for three of the hypotheses, i.e. the Structure of Cirri, Competition and Predation hypotheses. There was support for the Wave Tolerance and Temperature Stress hypotheses. The results suggest that: (1) physical factors vary along the horizontal gradient: wave height and wave strength are greatest at the exposed end, whereas temperatures and desiccation rates are highest at the calm end; (2) Octomeris is better adapted to withstand strong wave forces because it forms a strong, single-layered matrix; and (3) Tetraclita is better adapted to hot and dry conditions because its shell appears to have many characteristics that reduce heat-loading. Tetraclita and Octomeris therefore occur alone at either end of the gradient and overlap in the middle, where conditions are intermediate.",

Respiratory rate of the crabs was depressed at low concentrations of water soluble fraction (WSF) but stimulated at higher concentrations, these effects being more pronounced in males than in females. A synergistic relationship was found between the effects of low oxygen tension and WSF concentration that raised the threshold of dissolved oxygen at which death occurred. In the event of an oil spill, most S. catenata would deplete the available oxygen in their burrows before the next high tide. Death occurred at a concentration of dissolved oxygen of some 8,3 percent, but most crabs were found to leave their burrows and climb through the layer of Qatar Light crude oil or liquid paraffin when the level of dissolved oxygen dropped below c. 24 per cent.",

The wind field was determined from aircraft drift measurements at 152 m above the sea surface. It appears, from air temperature measurements, that weak thermal gradients were prevalent owing to the lower topographic relief and the upwind effect of the Agulhas Current. Case studies were selected following a westerly wind event and for two summer conditions, one prior to wind-forcing and the second after a high-pressure cell had ridged to the south of the continent causing strong east-south-easterly winds. The local wind field over the shelf was characterized by a downstream acceleration from Quoin Point to Cape Hangklip in response to increasing topographic relief. Upwelling centres were found off Cape Hangklip and on either side of Danger Point. Subsurface oceanic response to wind-forcing in Walker Bay was determined from temperature sections made from a ship in January 1978. The thermocline, located at 20 m, lifted to the surface within two days. Mean summer wind conditions from a coastal weather station at Danger Point indicated a \"divergent\" southerly flow, and periods of upwelling-favourable east-south-easterly winds occurred only at irregular intervals. The essential climatological ingredient for upwelling along the coast near Danger Point is discussed.",

Adult males and non-breeding females (> 33 mm) were found in the surf zone throughout the year but moved offshore in August/September. Breeding females were not an important component of the surf-zone population. Adult males as well as non-breeding and breeding females were present offshore throughout the year, the highest frequency of breeding females being recorded in summer.

    "abstract": "The continental shelf off Namibia is influenced by the Benguela Current with variable intensity year-round, and upwelling there has an important effect on the spawning habits of fish. During three cruises to northern Namibia, carried out in intensive and weak upwelling seasons, there were notable differences in the ichthyoplankton fauna. General features of the hydrography and plankton and an index of larval diversity calculated for all ichthyoplankton stations occupied during the three cruises are presented. Low larval diversity seemed to be related to centres of upwelling and, conversely, high larval diversity to hydrological stability. Principal components analysis was used to study the ichthyoplankton association patterns and their relation to external factors. In cruises carried out in upwelling periods (winter and spring) the main factors were identified as depth and latitude. A good relationship was found between species in the north of the survey area and warmer Angolan water during the autumn cruise. Hierarchical classification methods were also used, the points coefficient of correlation being used as a similarity index and the U PGM A as algorithm. Results obtained by this method of classification coincided with those obtained from principal components analysis.",

Dr Fridtjof Nansen using a systematic survey design. Precision from such designs is considered to be better than with a random design, but it cannot be quantified through standard analysis of variance. In 1998 and 1999, the trawl surveys were duplicated in full using a commercial trawler that operated in parallel with the Dr Fridtjof Nansen. Both vessels had the same fishing gear and rigging. In both years, biomass and distribution patterns estimated by the vessels were similar. The paired datasets collected from the surveys were used to analyse variability in the point samples. Absolute differences between pairs of catches were, in general, proportional to the catch, but they varied randomly following a normal distribution around the catch level. Local variability was analysed as random noise, modelled and later reapplied on single vessel data series to evaluate the effect of sample size and replicates on the survey mean. In a survey with 200 stations, local sample noise accounted for about 4% of the variability in the survey mean. Alternatively, running series of simulated surveys by bootstrapping on pairs of catch data gave similar results, when a small systematic vessel effect was adjusted for. The main statistical techniques applied were less susceptible to outlier catches than straightforward correlations or regressions and could therefore, perhaps with some advantage, also be used to estimate the vessel factor when intercalibrating trawl survey vessels.",

Growth of the southern population was described by the equation Lt = 73.556(1−e−0.065(t+3.92)) cm and for the northern population by Lt = 84.601(1−e−0.088(t+2.756) cm. Environmental conditions, such as difference in sea surface temperature, density-dependent competition for food, or biochemical genetic variations between the two populations, are possible reasons for the geographic differences found in the growth rates and length-at-age. Slow growth and longevity are characteristics of West Coast steenbras that make it extremely susceptible to overfishing; careful management of the resource is therefore essential.",

The application of Bayesian stock assessment methods in the management of Namibian orange roughy Hoplosthethus atlanticus within the 200 mile EEZ of Namibia is reviewed. Time-series of relative abundance are short and their reliability in indicating abundance trends is uncertain. The development of informative prior probability density functions (pdfs) for the constants of proportionality (q) for hydro-acoustic, commercial trawl swept area, and research trawl swept area indices produced statistically consistent prior estimates of absolute abundance for each of the three grounds where more than one index of abundance was available. The posterior pdfs for stock assessment model parameters were used to account for uncertainty in evaluations of the potential consequences of alternative harvesting policies under a stock reduction model in which catch removals were assumed to account for any declines. It appears that all orange roughy stocks off Namibia have been depleted below the limit reference point (50% of long-term unfished biomass). However, the stock reduction model could not easily account for the large declines in indices on the four fishing grounds over the period from 1995 until 1999 when the informative priors for q were applied. In the 2000 stock assessment, the Bayesian procedure was updated to account formally for uncertainty in model structures that could explain the decline in abundance. The possibility of very low stock abundance could still not be discounted when these uncertainties were accounted for. Although this most recent methodology applies more statistical rigour, its complexity has hindered its acceptance in Namibia. However, if it is worth quantifying risks and uncertainties in future stock assessments for the provision of precautionary management advice, it is proposed that the assessment protocols adopted be probabilistic to account for uncertainty in model parameters, that careful attention be given to subjective judgements about their inputs and the representation of uncertainty within them, and that, where appropriate, alternative hypotheses about stock abundance and mechanisms for catchability and stock decline be taken into account.",

Right whales arrive in June, reach peak abundance in September and depart in December or January. The incidence of calves increases from zero in June to 15–22% between August and October (reflecting the season of births), before increasing again to 33% in November and 42% in December (reflecting the earlier departure of animals without calves). The numbers of right whales seen off De Hoop on aerial surveys from 1971 to 1992 have increased at a rate faster than that of the inshore population as a whole, indicating a degree of net immigration into the area. The rate of this immigration may have slowed down during the past 10 years. Shore counts for adults show a positive correlation with aerial counts in the same year, confirming their utility in monitoring future trends in abundance.",

The two most common species on both coasts were Sepia australis and S. hieronis. Both were most abundant on the northern West Coast (Orange River and Port Nolloth areas) and were sparsely distributed over the rest of the region. The depths of greatest abundance were 60–190 m (S. australis and 110–250 m (S. hieronis. The highest biomass indices were recorded on the West Coast (S. australis — 5 250 tons in August 1988; S. hieronis — 1 070 tons in February 1988). The former species also peaked in May 1988 on the South Coast (803 tons). The environmental factors most influential in the distribution of the two species were bottom oxygen concentration and temperature. Both Sepia australis and S. hieronis are tolerant of very low levels of oxygen and S. australis is abundant in oxygen-depleted areas on the West Coast, where the best catches are associated with oxygen concentrations between 1,5 and 3.5 mℓ·ℓ−1. The two species were most abundant at relatively low temperatures: on the West Coast catches peaked when the temperatures were about 9°C. Of the remaining five species, four (S. officinalis vermiculata, S. papillata, S. simoniana and S. typica) are usually found in shallow water (<100 m), mainly on the South Coast. Rossia enigmatica, a sepiolid, is most abundant in 400–500 m of water, generally on the West Coast.",

Two distribution patterns for these species are currently recognized in the eastern South Atlantic. Extended Agulhas Pattern species are distributed as sexually mature specimens from south-west of the Cape of Good Hope to about 19°S; Agulhas Pattern species (juveniles and expatriate adults), have a more restricted distribution. It has been hypothesized that the Extended Agulhas Pattern originates via the system of rings and incursions, which are generated at and inshore of the Agulhas retroflection, and that the Agulhas Pattern arises from larval drift across the Agulhas Bank and subsequent entrainment in the shelf-edge jet. The two hypotheses were tested mainly on the basis of trawl collections of juveniles and adults in the region 17–45°S, 10–40°E, and on larval collections over the shelf and slope regions of the west coast of southern Africa and the western Agulhas Bank. The east-to-west passage of Indo-West Pacific warm-water, oceanic myctophids into the eastern South Atlantic takes place only between the 200 m isobath of the Agulhas Bank (to the north) and the Subtropical Convergence (to the south). The probability for larval drift across the Agulhas Bank appears to be low. Both patterns can be broadly correlated with the dynamics of the Agulhas Current. Differences may reflect seasonality in the penetration of Agulhas Current water into the region and in the reproductive cycles of western South Indian Ocean myctophids, as well as differences in the coherency and lifetime of the rings, filaments and intrusions.",

Although the species has an Antarctic circumpolar distribution, its most frequent area of appearance is in the South-West Atlantic, where commercial catches have been made. During the 1995 Illex argentinus fishing season, 852 tons of Martialia hyadesi were caught, the largest catches in recent years. The species was captured on the outer shelf and slope, between 38 and 50°S, from March until June. Catches of up to 40 tons per day were obtained in the area between 45 and 48°S (April–June), where surface temperatures ranged between 7 and 9°C. The squid caught were adults (221–375 mm mantle length ML), 70% of the males were mature and 90% of the females were immature. Statolith readings, assuming daily formation of increments, showed that most had hatched during the months October and November. According to stomach content analysis, fish represented 43.9% of the food consumed (90% myctophids), squid 36.6% (70% cannibalism on small juveniles) and zooplankton 19.5%. Juveniles of the same species were caught on the Patagonian slope and in the adjacent oceanic region during spring of 1988 and 1989, most of them in waters of the Malvinas Current (5–7°C). The sizes of those juveniles ranged between 15 and 81 mm ML and the ages (based on statolith increments) between 137 and 150 days, indicating that they had hatched during April.",

Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that S. bleekeri breeds in specific parts of the lake and that spawning takes place between September and December following a southward migration of reproductively active fish. The data suggest that S. bleekeri is able to vary its reproductive strategy. Under normal circumstances, the species migrates from the system to spawn at sea during winter along with other marine fish species which spend part of their life cycle in estuaries. However, when conditions within the lake are suitable, a part of the population will remain and breed there. Recruitment of S. bleekeri into the St Lucia estuarine system takes place from the muddy offshore marine banks, probably via surf zone nursery areas, as well as from within the system. There are indications that, in some years, post-spawners move back up the lake en masse, whereas in other years there is simply a gradual movement of fish.",

The majority of the copepod species remained within the sampling depth (0—85 m) and showed no marked diel movement. Those that did migrate (Nannocalanus minor and Metridia lucens) showed evidence of reverse migratory behaviour. There was ontogenetic layering in the vertical range of Euphausia lucens. While the calyptopis larvae remained near the surface and did not migrate, the older stages did, with the juvenile and adults moving through a greater depth range than the younger furcilia stages. The data are discussed with reference to previous depth records from work carried out mainly in the Atlantic Ocean, and specifically to records from local waters.",

Cold, upwelled water restricts latent heat loss by the sea surface and determines that only a small amount of sensible heat is gained by the sea. Measurements showed that these two turbulent heat fluxes are roughly equal and opposite and more or less cancel each other out. Therefore, the net radiation provided a good estimation of the total heat flux into the surface waters. During favourable conditions (in summer), the daily mean heat, exchange into the sea can be as high as 315 W·m−2, and it is capable of increasing the temperature of the upper 10 m mixed layer by as much as 0,65°C per day. This has important implications for biological production in the cold upwelled water when it is sun-warmed during its movement offshore.",

From January to July catches were dominated by P. indicus and thereafter by M. monoceros. In the smaller size categories, two peaks in catch per unit effort were identified.

Whereas south of 28°S and off the South African coast this species is mainly a coastal animal distributed on soft substrata at depths shallower than 150–200 m, the maximum densities in Namibia occur in much deeper waters (200–350 m). In winter, maximum relative densities of the species are found shallower (< 200 m depth) than in summer (200–300 m). This density shift is thought to be related to the fact that, in summer, the main upwelling period has passed and inshore oxygen levels on the bottom decrease to highly hypoxic values. The species avoids areas shallower than 200 m north of 27°S, the area where oxygen depletion is strongest during all seasons. Oxygen levels appear to be critical to the inshore distribution of the species, whereas temperatures of < 10–11°C seem to limit its distribution towards deeper waters. Highest abundances occur on sediments with 10–40 per cent silt-clay content. Population size structure did not show any apparent peaks which could be related to age cohorts.

Total linefishing effort is estimated at 1 415 121 man-hours fished per year. For 1985, the total landings of hottentot were approximately 400 tons and the importance of the species in the total catch was greatest at West Coast centres. Seasonality of catches is determined largely by operational trends in the snoek and rock-lobster fisheries. Values for the natural (M) and total (Z) mortalities of hottentot are estimated at 0,338·year−1 and 0,733·year−1 respectively. On applying a fishing mortality (F) of 0,395·year−1 to the Beverton and Holt yield-per-recruit model, it is established that the current fishing effort does not have much impact on the population size.

The initial rate of uptake was related to the concentration in the water, but a maximum level of accumulation was found after long-term exposure. The rate of depuration was closely related to the time of exposure prior to depuration. The depuration profile consists of an initial rapid loss followed by a slower loss of the remaining hydrocarbons. Increased exposure time decreases the relative quantity of hydrocarbons lost in the initial rapid depuration. The results indicate that the use of mussels as petroleum hydrocarbon input \"monitors\" might have limitations.",

The dynamics of the stock biomass on the spawning grounds were modelled in order to assess the effects of current effort levels and the existing closed season on the resource. The model assumes that process error dominates over observation error. The model has three parameters: g, a parameter which combines natural mortality, emigration and somatic growth; q, the catchability; I, which represents immigration to the spawning grounds. Estimates of the parameters were obtained by fitting the model to catch per unit effort data, and were used to project the stock biomass forward in time to evaluate the impact of various effort levels both with and without a closed season. Results from the study indicate that the biological and economic gains provided by the current closed season are small and that there is little justification for urgent action to curtail current effort levels. However, in view of the apparently high risk associated with the current levels of effort and the great sensitivity of the results to basic model assumptions, both maintenance of the closed season and avoiding increases above the current level of effort are recommended. Further, the level of effort may need to be reduced, and the option of lengthening an existing closed season to effect this may well prove easier to implement than any attempt to reduce the present number of participants in the fishery.",

Coherent interannual trends in surface ocean chlorophyll for both the west coast Benguela and the south coast Agulhas Bank areas correspond with sea surface temperature records, rather than with local records of upwelling-favourable winds. This finding implies that interannual variability in phytoplankton biomass, in contrast to the well-established seasonal cycle, is associated with large-scale oceanic circulation features and forcing mechanisms, rather than with localized upwelling events. The most probable causative mechanism is suggested to be anomalous advective fluxes of warm surface water into areas typically of high biomass deriving from the Agulhas Current retroflection in the south. Studying variability in phytoplankton biomass on the continental shelf in the context of large-scale oceanic circulation features is important to understanding long-term trends in productivity and fisheries resources.",

No predatory marine mammals were seen in the area during or after the stranding event. An interpretation of the stranding is presented with reference to historical reports of squid strandings worldwide.

A review of analyses of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) is presented, with emphasis on the southern summer optimum (mid January). EOFs 1 and 3 provide insight to the north-west monsoon outflow and its interaction with the easterly trade winds of the southern hemisphere. Inter-annual variability of the summer surface circulation is highlighted by the spatial structure of wind-stress anomalies and by time-series of wind-stress components, vorticity and divergence averaged over three areas: the Mascarene High, and the northern and the southern Moçambique Channel. The circulation patterns are associated with changes in convective intensity and cyclogenesis in the region surrounding Madagascar. This is brought out by correlation of standardized departures of rainfall and marine winds around southern Africa. Correlations in the zonal component are highest in the equatorial south-west Indian Ocean (r = −0,82, easterly) and near the southern tip of Madagascar (r = +0,93, westerly), suggestive of an anomaly in anticyclonic circulation during wet summers encompassing the entire eastern seaboard of Africa and centred on Madagascar. Correlations in the meridional component are highest in the equatorial south-west Indian Ocean (r = +0,92, southerly), in the 20°S latitude band (r = −0,66, northerly) and south of Africa (r = +0,83). The meridional correlation structure indicates a weakening of the monsoon outflow together with convergence between 25 and 30°S during wet summers.",

A Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to assess the consequences of an inappropriate placement of this boundary for the performance of the f 0,2 harvesting strategy currently applied to this resource. If there are two stocks in the region, their status would be incorrectly assessed, because catches taken from one would be mistakenly allocated to the other, leading to Total Allowable Catches (TACs) differing from those ideally intended. In general, the effects of inappropriate placement of the boundary are slight. The effects of random variation between the West Coast catches and the TACs for that coast are also inconsequential, unless the extent of this variation is substantial. The effect of systematic differences between West Coast catches and the corresponding TACs is of much greater importance. Achieving the desired ratio between the West and South Coast catches leads to less risk, higher TACs over the next five years and a lower probability of a TAC reduction during the same period. These results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on the fishing industry achieving the desired split of the hake TAC between the West and South coasts.",

The summer standing stock of Mazzaella capensis (33,5 tons) was too low to warrant exploitation, as was the winter standing stock (10 tons) of Aeodes orbitosa.

The low biomass of these two species limits, economically, their harvesting potential during that season. The mean carrageenan content of G. polycarpa and S. stiriata was 44–49% (gametophytes) and 39–41% (tetrasporophytes).

The hypothesis that the size and the locality of mud patches determine the density and geographic distribution of juvenile sole was investigated. Data from 10 trawling surveys, between 20 and 27°E along the southern Cape coast during the period 1986–1992, were analysed to assess the density and geographic distribution of juvenile Agulhas sole. Within the distribution area of Agulhas sole there are two localities which differ widely in the size of mud patches. Agulhas sole do not appear to be dependent on estuaries as nursery grounds, but juveniles were more abundant on the extensive mud patches of open marine coastal waters of the central Agulhas Bank than in large sheltered bays, with limited patches of mud, farther east. Spawning adults were found mainly on sandy sediment close to mud patches or farther offshore. The locality of spawning, in relation to the current dynamics, suggests that, on the inner shelf of the central Agulhas Bank, spawning products would not be dispersed by the Agulhas Current. However, towards the east, spawning products could be advected eastwards and sometimes be entrained in the eddies of the Agulhas Current.",

Two cores were recovered from beneath North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at approximately 3 000 m depth. Late Quaternary presence of NADW is indicated by the Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi assemblage on the Walvis Ridge (Core GeoB 1214) and the Bulimina alazanensis assemblage on the Namibian continental slope (Core GeoB 1710). The propagation of NADW is exclusively observed during interglacials, with maximum factor loadings in Stages 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11. These maxima are consistent with peaks in kaolinite/chlorite ratios and maxima of poorly crystalline smectite in the clay-mineral record. Kaolinite and poorly crystalline smectite are products of intense chemical weathering. They are injected into the NADW at low latitudes, north of the study area, and advected south. Chlorite, which is stable under cold weathering regimes, is a characteristic mineral of water masses of southern origin. During glacial stages, it is advected north with Southern Component Water (SCW). Above the NADW/SCW depths, kaolinite/chlorite ratios vary only slightly without a significant glacial-interglacial pattern, as measured in a core (GeoB 1712) from 1 000 m deep on the same profile of the Namibian continental slope off Walvis Bay.",

The diatoms were chlorotic and several species were undergoing resting spore formation. Source waters moved into the study area along the bottom during the 19th, advecting nutrient-rich water higher in the water column and stimulating the growth of the phytoplankton, particularly the diatoms. The same group of diatom species, dominated by Hemiaulus sinensis, was important throughout the survey period. A feature of the phytoplankton was the presence of large numbers of Chaetoceros resting spores, suggesting that a well defined spore-forming event had recently occurred.

Abundances measured at 11 sites, covering 740 km of coastline, showed that South Coast and West Coast sites averaged 1 323 and 67 individuals·m−2 respectively. Barnacles were not replaced by other sessile organisms on the West Coast; instead the amount of bare space increased proportionately. Two general, alternative hypotheses can explain the abundance pattern: either pre-recruitment factors, those affecting the abundance of larvae, settlers and juveniles (<5 mm in basal diameter), or post-recruitment factors, those affecting the abundance of larger individuals (>5 mm in basal diameter), are significantly different on the two coasts. Measurements conducted on adults of the two most common barnacle species, Tetraclita serrata and Octomeris angulosa, over a three-year period at a West and a South Coast site did not support the post-recruitment hypothesis. Measurements showed that adult growth and survival were not inferior on the West Coast. First, the average sizes and maximum sizes of adults of the two species were greater at the West Coast site. Second, the growth rate of Octomeris angulosa was significantly higher at the West Coast site. Third, the survival rates of adults of both species were higher at the West Coast site. Additional support for the pre-recruitment factors hypothesis was provided by the number of recruits that were present in clearings that had been left for three years; these being 70 times more abundant in the clearings at the South Coast site. The results suggest that the geographic pattern in barnacle abundance along the South African coast is produced by differences in pre-recruitment factors rather than post-recruitment factors.",

Eight of the more than 80 recorded species caught by the trawlers during the entire period contributed >98% to the total landed catch. These are hake, horse mackerel, panga, Agulhas sole, kingklip, Cape gumard, silver kob and chokka squid. There was a notable decline in total catch and catch rate over the period reviewed, together with considerable change in the overall catch composition. For the two time-periods for which there are accurate catch data, hake, horse mackerel and panga consistently contributed in excess of 85% to the total annual landings. There were significant decreases in the size-at-(50%) recruitment for hake, horse mackerel and panga. Although at face value it would appear that the fishery is in decline, the causative factors are largely unknown and cannot be quantified properly owing to the paucity of comparable data. The need for further detailed investigation into the population dynamics of principal species in the Eastern Cape is discussed, particularly as it pertains to spawner biomass on the Agulhas Bank.",

Larval identification was based on morphological characteristics and the pigmentation pattern. The spatio-temporal distribution of kingklip larvae for a 12-month period provided information on spawning areas and seasons of the species. Different spawning strategies of the species over the western Agulhas Bank and on the West Coast are suggested. Over the Agulhas Bank, spawning starts when sea surface temperature begins to decrease and extends through the cooler periods (winter/spring). On the West Coast, spawning takes place only in those months in which upwelling is less intense (June–December).",

From automatic weather stations, moored buoys and aerial surveys, a pronounced diurnal cycle in south-easterly wind flow was documented. The orography of the northern portion of the Cape Peninsula is complex, with mountain ridges causing a nocturnal downslope wind jet exceeding 10 m·s−1 during anticyclonic weather conditions. This phenomenon is detailed in three case studies presented. When an inversion layer descended below the top of nearby Table Mountain (1 000 m), a downwind wake developed extending 40 km over the Atlantic Ocean. The wake effectively separated surface upwelling plumes emanating from either side of Cape Town, and it expanded and contracted in sympathy with changes in the horizontal temperature gradient and the inversion layer. A wind-shear line developed at the interface between the downslope jet and the wake with a 24-hour cycle.",

The initial development of fouling communities at each depth was similar on stainless steel, aluminium, fibreglass, polyvinylchloride and silicon rubber, but it was reduced on corrosive mild steel. With the exception of a few species that rarely settled on dark materials, many species did not seem to discriminate actively between the substrata. Later succession resulted in heavy fouling of the metals. Reduced bioadhesion caused by hydrophobicity may explain why the synthetics, especially silicon rubber, had a reduced ability to support bulky, complex fouling communities in contrast to the wettable metals. Although there were major differences between study sites in the annual community development, the conclusions on relative susceptibility to biofouling of the various materials were not affected.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Until 1975 catches of chub mackerel in the South-East Atlantic were mainly made by purse-seine vessels off the Western Cape, South Africa, but subsequently by midwater or demersal trawlers fishing primarily off South West Africa (Namibia). Chub mackerel were most abundant in the northern Benguela Current region during the austral spring and summer, appeared to migrate through the central region in autumn, and were caught on the southern fishing grounds from winter through mid-spring. These movements can plausibly be related to seasonal patterns of prey availability. An exceptionally powerful year-class appears to have been formed in 1977 and to have been largely responsible for the peak catch of about 200 000 tons in 1978. As with powerful year-classes produced in the mid 1960s, the 1977 year-class arose after a period of unusually poor upwelling, but when a forage species was plentiful. Mortality inflicted by chub mackerel and other predators on anchovy Engraulis capensis off the Western Cape appears to have been low immediately prior to a large increase in the anchovy stock in this area. A total annual catch of chub mackerel from the South-East Atlantic not exceeding the mean value for the period 1971—1982, i.e. about 70 000 t, is provisionally suggested.",

Most of the effort was expended between 350 and 449 m, the depth range where the kingklip catch rate was highest.

Studies on the abundance of pilchard (sardine) and anchovy populations subject to heavy exploitation have revealed the possible succession of sardine by anchovy as the dominant species. In investigating the evidence for species replacement, a simple, age-structured computer simulation model was developed, which assumes that the system is initially in a steady state. The model's sensitivity to starting biomass, natural mortality, harvesting, the level at which density-dependence is initiated and environmental perturbation is considered. Important factors determining the results are the present estimates of natural mortality and the level at which density-dependence is initiated. A lower natural mortality in pilchard results in dominance by anchovy. High threshold values of density-dependence produce dynamic oscillation in the model populations. Harvesting affects the natural balance between populations in a system at steady-state, causing the dominant stock to decline, resulting in species replacement. This situation is particularly evident in scenarios employing harvesting numbers-at-age. The intensity and the duration of harvesting determines whether replacement is temporary or permanent. The model populations show resistance toward environmental perturbation; indeed, in scenarios including it, species replacement is delayed.",

    "abstract": "The vertical distribution of eggs of the sternoptychid Maurolicus muelleri from different localities worldwide was analysed on the basis of apparently conflicting literature and new data. Although the vertical distribution has been classified as \"variable\", most data from hydrographically comparable areas were similar. Differences at both larger and smaller geographical scales were mainly a consequence of environmental variability and to a minor extent the result of sampling limitations. In North Atlantic waters of average salinity and with a temperature range of 8–10°C, eggs generally occur deep because of their relatively high density. In less saline waters off New Zealand and also perhaps off Japan the same has been found. In highly saline waters such as those of the Mediterranean Sea, the eggs have a much shallower distribution. In areas without vertical motion of water masses, the depth of occurrence depends directly on the density of seawater. The equilibrium densities are not uniform worldwide and some density ranges are given. In areas with lower salinities, eggs show adaptations via a larger \"perivitelline space\", which results in reduced specific gravity. Eggs cannot compensate for high seawater densities. In upwelling ecosystems, eggs are found shallower than would be expected from the equilibrium density range present. Alternative hypotheses are discussed, that in upwelling systems spawning occurs shallower, or that eggs are transported upwards with upwelling waters. In the Benguela upwelling system, shallow distributions could coincide with high mortality of eggs.",

Pollution is defined as environmental damage caused by the accidental or deliberate discharge of wastes. Damage is defined as undesirable change in the environment, but identifying the cause of environmental change is difficult against the background of natural fluctuations. Pollution-abatement costs rise exponentially with the effluent quality demanded, so it is important that scientific assessment should be reliable. However, the decision about an appropriate trade-off between environmental and financial costs is political, not scientific. Public perceptions are beginning to make many waste-disposal options unacceptable. As a result, remedial action is often inappropriate and merely transfers the pollution from one environment to another without addressing the basic issue that wastes continue to be created and have to be disposed of somewhere. There is an urgent need for dispassionate scientific advice, even if it may be over-ruled by other considerations, but scientific assessment requires a good knowledge of how the local marine environment behaves.",

At nine subtidal red-bait beds, reductions in percentage cover of red-bait were greatest on the crests of reefs (42 ± 17%:1SD) and lowest on the landward edges (17 ± 8%). The test of P. stolonifera appeared to be the main site of the microbial infection. Scanning electron and epifluorescent microscopy revealed much higher numbers of bacteria on the tests of infected individuals (64.3 ± 5.5 × 106·mm−2) compared to healthy ones (5.1 ± 0.1 × 106·mm−2). Fat, curved rod bacteria and thick chains, which accounted for more than 45% of the bacteria on infected red-bait tests, were absent from the tests of healthy red-bait. Standard characterization techniques, coupled with API tests, showed that the isolates from infected red-bait tests belonged exclusively to the genus Vibrio, whereas isolates from healthy tests included the genera Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas and Flavobacterium/Cytophaga. The mass mortality therefore appeared to be associated with the proliferation of large curved rod bacteria of the genus Vibrio. Recolonization by P. stolonifera into areas naturally denuded of red-bait was significantly faster than for experimental plots cleared of all organisms during the mid 1980s. A mean cover of 33 ± 4% was recorded for P. stolonifera after 38 months following natural mortality, whereas it took 71 months to achieve a comparable recovery of 35 ± 20% in experimental plots. Possible reasons for this difference (viz. substratum, recruitment and predation) are explored.",

The 57 biochemical provinces of Longhurst (1995, Progress in Oceanography 36) are suggested as standard for all global stratification of the world's oceans, because these \"Longhurst areas\", contrary to traditionally defined LMEs, permit direct comparisons of results from different disciplines. Examples of such comparisons, emphasizing the competition between fisheries and marine mammals, are given for the Pacific Ocean. The case is made that methods exist for rigorous descriptions of the trophic fluxes prevailing in such ecosystems, and based thereon, for dynamic modelling of at least the first-order impact of fisheries on LMEs. Also, emphasis is given on the need to reconstruct the earlier, unexploited states of ecosystems so as to obtain baselines for correctly evaluating fisheries impacts, and to evaluate the benefits foregone by present exploitation patterns. The need for fisheries scientists to reconceive their work from one principally devoted to optimizing short- and medium-term returns to the fishing industry to one serving a broader set of clients is emphasized. A recent initiative, the Marine Stewardship Council, serves as an example of the many new approaches that will be required if the public at large is to become an active stakeholder in conserving the biodiversity of LMEs.",

Departures of rotated principal component 1 of late summer outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) reflect a dipole between the south-western plateau (Kalahari) and the Angolan coast, which explains 47% of total field variance over southern Africa. The principal component scores are correlated with SST off Angola and with other tropical regions exhibiting global El Niño responses. The spatial loading implies diminished convective rainfall over the Kalahari when tropical SST to the northwest of Angola is > 0,7°C (∼1 standard deviation) above normal, for example in 1984. SST fluctuations in discrete areas of the tropical South-Eastern Atlantic are examined. The annual cycle is dominated by an inverse relationship between SST and pressure, with a maximum (minimum for pressure) in the months February to April. South-easterly trade winds are prevalent throughout the year, but are considerably weaker in the \"bight\" of Angola. Composite warm events in the late summers of 1963, 1973, 1984 and 1988 are analysed using normalized departures. The results indicate that oceanic warm events are locally generated in the region 0–10°S, 0–15°E, following a reduction in trade winds locally and to the west in the preceding year. Maximum SST is attained typically in March, following a sudden increase after the previous November. The composite precursors suggest that empirical predictability of South-Eastern Atlantic warm events is limited. Relationships between the 1995 event and drought over the Kalahari are discussed. Further research on sea levels, thermocline depth and currents, coupled to numerical modelling, could offer improved insights.",

Phytoplankton degradation products, commonly known as gelbstoff, represent a large potential error source to future remotely sensed chlorophyll data, particularly in highly productive regions, where there can be a dramatic lack of covariance between phytoplankton and gelbstoff concentrations. Data relevant to gelbstoff character in the Agulhas Bank and southern Benguela systems are examined to assess the variability of gelbstoff chromophoric structure in these regions. These take the form of gelbstoff absorption spectra, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices, performed on filtered seawater samples. Modelled bio-optical data, using conditions typical of high biomass marine environments, are then used to assess the performance of a proposed SeaWiFS combined algorithm with respect to variations in the magnitude and nature of gelbstoff absorption. It is shown that expected algorithm performance can be poor in bloom type scenarios, and that an appreciation of algorithm application is needed for effective interpretation of ocean colour imagery.",

Inflow of warm, oligotrophic oceanic water into the inshore zone in December 1974 and 1976 caused a marked depression in the nitrate concentrations and in the expected chlorophyll concentrations at the time of the summer blooms. The timing of these inflows appears to influence the biosphere response, suggesting that annually or monthly averaged time-series may not always be appropriate for demonstrating links between biological variability and physical forcing. A finer resolution may be required. The impact of diurnal heating on sea surface temperatures may mask important source characteristics of the surface water.

During upwelling, the concentration of lytic factor rises to 3 100 units·mg−1 style protein but falls to < 1 unit·mg−1 during downwelling. The lytic factor cause lysis of a wide range of marine bacterial strains, those isolated from the water column being particularly sensitive. The lytic factor is stable at 80°C.

The surveys have revealed that pelagic fish shoals, believed to be of anchovy, occurred around the Orange River throughout the year, and that there was a consistent gap in their distribution between Chamais Bay and Lüderitz. The findings of the present investigation support the concept of the Lüderitz upwelling cell as a barrier separating the Namibian and Cape anchovy stocks. It is postulated that the upwelling and offshore flow of cold water prevent southward penetration of Namibian recruits and in most years cause a portion of the north-drifting larvae from the Cape stock to be advected out of the system. In extreme years, such as 1986/87, warm-water intrusions inhibit this loss and provide an unusually large supplement to recruitment off Namibia. Samples of post-larval anchovy taken north of the Orange River in April 1983 showed a trend of increasing fish length with decreasing distance from the coast, consistent with an advection of these fish by the onshore flow of water, which is known to occur in this region. These fish presumably migrate or are advected southwards in coastal waters to join anchovy which have been retained farther south.

A limited sample size (n = 14) of mid-latitude cyclone cases meeting prescribed criteria, equally divided between two areas south-west (west) and south-east (east) of Africa, are averaged and contrasted. Comparisons of composite features for west and east cases distinguish the influence of differing sea temperature regimes. Mid-latitude cyclones in the east entrain air overlying the \"warm pool\" of the Agulhas Current recirculation gyre, and exhibit increased baroclinic structure, stronger uplift, enhanced zonal winds and greater water vapor content. Analysis of structural differences may assist marine forecasts and highlights the role that SST plays in modulating the intensity of mid-latitude cyclones south of Africa.",

The male/female ratio of 150:113 for all untagged seals trapped by research trawls did not differ significantly from the expected sex ratio of 53:47 for untagged seals on the colonies. However, more male than female tagged seals were trapped in commercial trawls (81 and 19 respectively), the sex ratio being significantly different from the expected ratio of 65:35 for harvested tagged seals. Most of the seals trapped in research trawls were caught during mid water trawls, but most seals trapped in commercial trawls were caught by the offshore trawling sector. Numbers of seals trapped increased with age, suggesting that scavenging from trawlers may be a learned behaviour. However, the number of males trapped decreased after age 4½ years, consistent with the natural decline in their numbers with age. The fewer seals trapped in summer (November – February) may be linked to their breeding cycle.",

Using hydrographic information collected with the larvae, the effect of surface currents on the observed patterns of distribution is discussed. In the South-East Atlantic, adjacent to the Benguela upwelling system, larvae of the pseudoceanic Lampanyctodes hectoris were found farther offshore (250–450 km) than usual. The general flow of the current is parallel to the coast, but upwelling filaments extend offshore. The size distributions of the L. hectoris larvae found, together with the rather low temperature at two of the oceanic stations sampled, indicate that they had been displaced by a filament. In the South-West Indian Ocean, the distribution of larvae of highly oceanic species of lanternfish over the shelf is related to onshore intrusions of the Agulhas Current. The size distributions of Hygophum hygomii and Scopelopsis multipunctatus indicate southward transport of larvae. The presence of larvae of Myctophum selenops and Benthosema pterotum, which have not been documented as adults in the region, indicates not only transport to the area, but also that spawning could be taking place closer to the area than previously reported.",

Surveys of intertidal exploiters and their catches were conducted simultaneously on five randomly selected weekdays and weekends per season between June 1995 and June 1996 at Umtata Mouth, Mngcibe and Lwandile. Three-way ANOVAs were used to assess the influence of site, season and day of the week (weekday or weekend) on the density of the three major groups of exploiters: shellfish-gatherers, seaweed-harvesters and bait-collectors, and on the offtake by shellfish-gatherers. The densities of shellfish-gatherers or seaweed-harvesters did not differ between sites, but there were marked differences in the density of bait-collectors and the quantity of organisms removed by shellfish-gatherers. The numbers in all exploiter groups were lowest in winter, because of factors such as inaccessibility caused by rough seas, poor quality of the preferred shellfish and a clash with such agricultural activities as harvesting of maize. The densities of adult shellfish-gatherers and shellfish offtake were both significantly higher on weekdays than at week-ends. However, more children gathered shellfish during the weekends and in summer, perhaps attributable to the closure of schools.",

However, during the late 1980s, the Coastal Transition Zone Programme studied these features in detail off California, leading to more information about their physical dynamics and their relation to ecosystem structure. First, the filaments are the surface signature of the offshore-flowing limbs of meanders in the core equator-ward jet of the California Current. Modelling studies have shown that the core jet of the California Current is hydrodynamically unstable, leading to these meanders and to the separated eddies which surround the meandering jet. This process of instability has nothing directly to do with the wind field, so it appears that the fundamental dynamics of filaments has little to do with either coastal upwelling or meteorological forcing. Second, it could be asked why a continuous jet does not appear as a continuous meandering band in sea surface temperature or enhanced chlorophyll. The explanation is that water proceeding offshore in a filament subducts at a rate of the order of 10 m·day−1. Therefore, the sea surface signature of the filament is removed before the jet can turn back toward the coast. Finally, observations of phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure demonstrate that the core of the meandering jet represents a continuous ecological boundary.",

The diet was dominated by anchovy, although pilchard, horse mackerel, round herring and chokka squid were also taken. The relative abundance of anchovy in penguin diet was highest between 1984 and 1989, coinciding with a period of favourable environmental conditions for recruitment of anchovy and a subsequent increase in fish biomass. The more recent decrease in dietary abundance of anchovy and its partial replacement by pilchard is consistent with independent (ship-borne acoustic) evidence of a recent increase in pilchard biomass. In contrast to these congruent trends, the size of anchovy taken by penguins between 1980 and 1990 has decreased dramatically, across years of good and poor recruitment. The reasons for this remain obscure but may reflect, in part, poor recruitment of anchovy in the latter part of the decade. Monthly changes in the size frequency distribution of anchovy consumed by penguins apparently reflect seasonal patterns of fish migration.",

Recruitment occurred in spring and autumn, but periodogram analyses revealed additional cycles with frequencies of 24–36 months. There was no geographic pattern in long-term differences in abundance between sites nor were these related to human disturbance. Recruitment intensity was significantly related to mean abundance of adults, which may indicate limited larval dispersal or gregarious settlement. Maximum aperture length increased by 3,0 mm in the first year but increased by only 1 mm·year−1 in the third year. Individual growth was variable, with small individuals often overtaking larger ones. There were few large individuals, those of 7,0 mm or more constituting only 3% of the population. An analysis of longevity indicated a mean lifespan of 1,5 + 0,5 years.",

An average of 10,2 seals (with standard deviation of the mean 0,48 and range of 0—30) was counted on 122 occasions between April 1974 and April 1979. Numbers were generally greater in winter (12,5±0,71) than summer (7,8±0,48). Many of the seals were resting at the surface. Almost half of them occurred singly; group size averaged 1,7 with a maximum of 14. The seals consumed fish that fell into the water during discharging operations. Water samples from both the surface and near the bottom were collected during 1981 from two stations in Alfred Basin and two in adjacent areas closer to the open sea. Temperature and salinity measurements showed the existence of a wedge of colder, denser water at the bottom of the docks. Nutrient levels and levels of oxygen absorbed were indicative of a polluted area. Oil levels varied widely but were three or four orders of magnitude higher than in the open sea. The regular presence of seals in Alfred Basin suggests that the appeal to them of a consistent food supply outweighs any disadvantage that might stem from a polluted habitat. However, it is not possible to determine from this study whether human activity in Alfred Basin will have any long-term beneficial or detrimental effects on the seals there.",

Results indicate that the length distributions of catches taken by the Welwitchia were significantly different from those from commercial trawlers, with a greater proportion of fish >25 cm being sampled by the latter. Also, the biomass estimated per length-class from hydroacoustic surveys over the period 1994–2000 was compared with those from annual landings of the commercial fishery. The length distribution of horse mackerel in purse-seine catches compares favourably with those from the research vessel. However, comparisons with the midwater trawl catches indicated that the length frequencies obtained from research vessels during the years 1994–1997 underestimated the number of large fish in the population and biased the biomass in those years. From 1998 to 2000 the bias was negligible. The magnitude of the error varied between years, but it remained fairly low. To compensate for this bias, length distribution data from midwater trawlers should be integrated into the acoustic biomass calculation procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abundance and exploitation patterns of monkfish Lophius vomerinus and L. vaillanti were investigated for use as inputs into a stock assessment framework to be used for management of the Namibian monkfish resource. Total numbers of monkfish caught per size-class were estimated using industry records of tail products classified into six commercial categories. The proportions per category varied each year. Analysis of the commercial data suggests that large numbers of juvenile monkfish are harvested annually. Catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) data of vessels targeting monkfish and sole (the two species are combined in terms of Namibian fleet legislation) for the period 1991–1999 were analysed using two different methods to construct indices of abundance. Both indices, one standardized on vessel horsepower and the other standardized by means of a Generalized Linear Model, showed an increase in catch rate of monkfish from 1991 to 1994 and between 1996 and 1998, but a decline from 1994 to 1996 as well as during 1999. Conversion factors for landed or tail weight to whole weight for four different tail products of monkfish were estimated. Results obtained from the study suggest that the factor of 3.04 currently applied in Namibia to all tail-weight classes is not appropriate for the current fishery and needs to be amended. For management purposes it is also suggested that four different conversion factors, one for each monkfish tail product, be implemented.",

However, analysis of this literature and the results of trawling surveys in the North-East Atlantic suggest only exceptional occurrences in the tropics. Plankton surveys off N.W. Africa, up to and including 1977, rarely yielded M. scolopax larvae off the coast of the southern Sahara and not at all off Mauritania, though a few specimens were collected after having been swept southwards in the open ocean by the Canary Current. Larvae did occur off northern Mauritania in February 1983. Details of distribution, abundance and length composition of early stages caught during the period January–April 1983 are given. It is concluded that the reproductive range of M. scolopax (as well as that of some other temperate species) extends south of that documented and that its spawning season there may be shorter than in the centre of this species' distribution.

A decreasing trend in stock biomass estimates from 1984 was more clearly discernible when the calendar-year data set was employed.

Several such fronts have been described in the Antarctic Ocean. In this study, planktonic, microbiological and chemical parameters were investigated in Antarctic waters in order to separate the water masses according to different patterns of biological parameters within the pelagic environment. Non-parametric statistical analysis of the data was used to demonstrate the biological structure of the pelagic system. In many cases the pelagic environment seems to exhibit a biological or chemical structure apparently independent of the water masses as defined by conservative properties. This is considered to result mainly from the distribution of planktonic organisms and the behaviour of particulate organic material during sedimentation, the latter seeming to be strongly affected by the degree of microbial degradation. It is suggested that the biological definition of water masses should consider the biological history of particular water masses in addition to oceanographic parameters, thereby yielding a better understanding of biological processes in relation to oceanographic fronts.",

In the experiments with adults, where crude oil was added to the surface of the water and WSF was not renewed, 50-per-cent mortality was not obtained, but the crabs were sub-lethally affected (righting response and escape mechanism). These sub-lethally affected crabs usually recovered after a few hours as the WSF of the crude oil escaped rapidly from the seawater, only 32 per cent remaining after 24 h. In the experiment where the experimental solution was renewed every 8 hours, the 24-h and 96-h LC50 values were 12,0 and 9,2 mg·ℓ−1. Ecological toxicity (animals affected, not killed) was in all cases lower than acute toxicity, larvae being much more sensitive than adults. In the event of an oil spill, it is unlikely that the oil in the seawater contained in the crab burrows will reach the high concentrations required to produce death in these crabs.",

The total benthic standing stocks in terms of organic carbon (macrofauna, meiofauna and bacteria) have been estimated in the SEEP area. Their preponderance on the continental shelf was partial evidence that little organic matter escapes to the upper continental slope. Measurements of the metabolism of the biota allowed calculation of turnover times of organic detritus and the total biota. The turnover time of detritus increased as grain size decreased, suggesting that fine-grained deposits contain mostly refractory, non-reactive compounds, especially on the deep slope. Turnover times of the total biota were about the same in the coarse- as in the fine-grained shelf deposits, but a far larger fraction of the turnover was attributed to the bacteria in the fine sediments. On average, about 25 per cent of the primary production appeared to be utilized by the aerobic benthos on the continental shelf in the SEEP area. The role of anaerobes at depth in the sediments remains uncertain. This study, along with a review of other recent work, leads to the conclusion that only a small fraction of continental shelf phytodetritus is exported across a distinct shelf-slope hydrographic frontal system. What is not consumed in the spring is utilized on the shelf during the ensuing stratified season. More open ended ecosystems may export production more readily.",

The model depicts the flow of nitrogen, which is often limiting in marine ecosystems, from kelps, other macrophytes and phytoplankton, through filter-feeders to carnivores, with a feedback loop via faeces and bacteria to detritus and filter-feeders. When modelled as a closed system, bacteria associated with detritus and animal faeces form a large component of the particulate nitrogen available to filter-feeders, and the faeces feedback loop dominates nitrogen flow. When measured rates of water transport are incorporated into the model, bacteria have little opportunity to accumulate before being transported out of the system. Animal faeces and kelp detritus are the dominant filter-feeder food components under upwelling conditions, whereas phytoplankton is the major contributor to particulate organic nitrogen under downwelling conditions. When realistic pulses of upwelling/downwelling derived from wind indices are used as model input, filter-feeders are shown to decline during the summer upwelling season when much potential food is advected out of the system, and they increase during the winter when downwelling conditions are more prevalent, bringing in nitrogen-rich phytoplankton from the blooms developing offshore.",

The upwelling plume decayed more rapidly than expected from a reduction in wind stress and downward mixing. This decay process is illustrated by a case study of aerial survey results taken in November 1979. An alongshore variation in equatorward wind stress was observed as the atmospheric pressure gradient migrated southwards in front of a coastal low. The spatial variation of wind stress ranged from near zero north of the Cape Peninsula to 5 dynes·cm−2 to the south. The resultant differential pattern of offshore Ekman transport sets up a sea slope from high in the north to low in the south. The slope appears to drive a southward downwelling current that causes the sudden decay of the Cape Peninsula upwelling plume. Such currents are confirmed by moored time series and drifter tracks and appear to be important to the mesoscale dynamics of the southern Benguela region.",

    "abstract": "Time-series of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the Cape hake stocks demarcated by ICSEAF in the Benguela region show steady declines until the late 1970s, followed by slowly increasing trends once catch levels were reduced. Analysis of these data by means of a dynamic form of the production model is discussed briefly, and it is shown that sustainable-yield-determining parameters could not be estimated with any reasonable degree of precision prior to the data contrast provided by the change in CPUE trends in the late 1970s. In general, an f0.1 harvesting strategy has been applied to allow recovery of these resources from their depleted levels of the late 1970s. Analysis indicates that, except for ICSEAF Division 1.6, these stocks have now reached their equilibrium biomass levels under such a strategy. The question thus arises whether f0.1 is the appropriate long-term strategy, i.e. to what extent current catches (or catch level increments) should be \"traded\" for future CPUE improvements. This is examined by means of Clark's bioeconomic model, which indicates that strategies corresponding to a lower fishing effort than that for f0.1 are economically more advantageous. The precision with which the shape of the surplus production function can be estimated is poor; the implications of this for the choice of an appropriate harvesting strategy are discussed briefly. It is suggested that, as an initial amended strategy for most of these stocks, catch levels should be pegged at their f0.1 equilibrium levels once the corresponding biomass level is exceeded. However, for Division 1.6, a change from an f0.1 to an f0.2 strategy is proposed. The economic advantages of this strategy are illustrated",

    "abstract": "An age-structured population model was used to examine the variability of yield created by randomly fluctuating recruitment success in the South African anchovy Engraulis capensis stock. Three different harvesting strategies were examined: (1) constant age-specific pattern of fishing mortality, (2) constant quota with effort limitation and (3) annual quota adjustments by means of an F msy procedure. Variable recruitment was generated by a stochastic stock-recruit relationship, and mean yields, mean spawner biomasses and probability distributions of yield were calculated at each exploitation level after 150 projections from the population structure of anchovy in 1981. Under conditions of constant fishing mortality, the variability of yield increased continuously as the exploitation rate was increased. The maximum average yield (MAY) is the stochastic equivalent of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of deterministic models, but an attempt to sustain this MAY by a constant quota resulted in a very high risk of stock collapse. An Fmsy policy based on pre-season adult biomass resulted in more variable yields than were obtained at the equivalent constant fishing mortality at age. Stability of yield therefore demanded the acceptance of lower average yields than could be attained in the long term by quota adjustment. It was considered that the South African purse-seine industry could not cope with the wide fluctuations of yield necessary to attain MAY. Specific management policies sufficiently robust to withstand both fluctuating recruitment success and the uncertainties in the parameters of working population models would be required.",

In such species, assessment of changing trends in spawning from long-term catch data may present unique problems if fish with hydrated oocytes are seldom identified in the routine sampling of catches. A prerequisite for the method is to determine the interrelationship between ovary weight, the stages of oocyte development and fish size. For pilchard Sardinops ocellatus, the relationship between ovary weight in g (Y), oocyte volume in mm3 (X 1) and fish length in cm (X 2) was log Y = −1,97 + 0,52 log X 1 + 2,66 log X 2. The relationship was used to determine ovary-weight boundaries for a selected stage of oocyte development close to hydration for all length classes. These boundaries were then applied to low-resolution catch data from about 10 000 females collected between June 1972 and October 1974 to show the monthly percentages of fish close to spawning. For a species spawning batches at short intervals over a long period, the analysis revealed the beginning and end of spawning, as well as peaks during the spawning season, more clearly than did gonosomatic indices.",

The mid-season estimate of food availability failed to reveal important fluctuations, such as the small biomass of copepods in January 1994, which contributed to the early cessation of spawning and subsequent poor recruitment in 1994.

As these organisms grow very slowly, enrichment and fed-batch cultures were prepared to obtain pure cultures. The nitrifying bacteria are chemolithotrophs and can only be identified by observing their arrangement of internal or cytomembranes with the aid of the transmission electron microscope. All five listed genera of marine nitrifying bacteria were observed, namely Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus, which oxidize ammonia to nitrite, and Nitrobacter, Nitrococcus and Nitrospina, which oxidize nitrite to nitrate. Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi represented the dominant organisms in enrichment cultures and were also obtained in pure culture. Examination of the colonial morphology indicated the lack of distinct characteristics that could aid in their identification.

The relationship between winds and coastal upwelling is established and statistical analyses reveal prominent cycles at 24 hours and 5–20 days. The extent, trajectory and dilution of the heated effluent water discharged by Koeberg in its operational mode is studied by means of field observations. Intensive surveys, made under various conditions, show that the warm plume mixes via inherent turbulence and wave action. Wave action and the breakwater structure cause the plume to drift southwards along the beach. Farther offshore, the buoyant plume spreads laterally, halving the sea temperature excess. Outside the surf zone, the diluted water remains at the surface and is advected by wind-driven currents. Ambient conditions appear to be maintained along the sea bed except within 500 m of the outfall, and the potential for ecological impact by the warm plume is therefore spatially limited.",

Zooplankton mortality averaged 17,48 per cent for all species and 21,88 per cent for copepods, the dominant group. Plankton entrainment at Koeberg was not considered to be particularly detrimental to the marine environment because of the localized area affected, the rapid dispersion of heat and chlorine, the rapid regeneration times of phytoplankton and some zooplankton, the low abundance of commercially important species, and the potential for recruitment from the surrounding productive Benguela upwelling region.

More recently, fisheries for H. midae have developed along the east coast of South Africa, but there is very little information on the extent of the abalone stocks there. No H. midae are found north of the Mbashe River, but mean density between Wavecrest and the Mbashe River was 0,17 abalone·m−2 of reef and the highest density was 0,84 abalone·m−2 of reef. These densities are probably optimum habitat densities rather than average densities. Densities were generally lower at the northern end of the abalone range, but differences between the north and the south were not significant. At the northern limit, the population consisted mainly of small abalone. There was no significant difference in the numbers of abalone caught per diver per diving hour at the different stations, but catch rate (cpue) by mass of abalone was higher in the south. Highest cpue was 55 abalone (25 kg whole mass) per diver per diving hour. Sex ratios were 1:1 and abalone off the East Coast reached maturity at a size smaller than those off the South-Western Cape. Yield- and egg-per-recruit modelling indicated that reducing the current minimum legal size from 114 mm to 80 or 94 mm shell width would provide slightly better yields per recruit only at high values of natural mortality. However, at a smaller minimum legal size, egg production is reduced to below 50% at very much lower levels of fishing effort. Maintaining the current minimum legal size of 114 mm shell width ensures at least 30–50% egg production for virtually all realistic levels of fishing effort at all values of natural mortality investigated. The conclusion is that the stocks have rather limited potential for commercial exploitation.",

The malformation consisted of a cord- or truncus-like structure at the left cranio-apical ventricle. It is interpreted as an atypical second root of the cephalic aorta reflecting an originally paired anlage of the heart in ancestral cephalopods. In considering possible causes of this atavistic abnormality, the high tributyltin (TBT) contamination recorded in the Bay at the time should not be overlooked.",

A range of growth rates represented by von Bertalanffy growth curves is estimated for both A. ater and J. lalandii. Five models of differing complexity, based on the age distributions of these populations, are formulated to examine the effects various parameters have on population size composition and to investigate optimal exploitation of J. lalandii. These are single-species models of mussels and lobsters with constant recruitment, a lobster model with variable recruitment and two models in which lobster growth is influenced by mussel availability: one in which there is constant and one with variable rock-lobster recruitment. Data are compiled for three areas of differing J. lalandii growth rates and A. ater biomass. Growth and predation have marked effects on the size structure of the prey population, whereas the size composition of the predator population is affected by growth and harvesting. The simplest of the lobster models, the single-species model with constant recruitment and the lobster-mussel model with variable recruitment, produced the most practical information for J. lalandii management. The lobster model incorporating variable recruitment is unstable and the lobster-mussel model with constant recruitment requires fine-tuning. A number of conclusions are reached about rock-lobster harvesting strategies because the results differ from area to area according to growth and harvesting rates and depend on the specific assumptions made in each of the models.",

Embryos showed a number of abnormalities, of which only one occurred in numbers that could be related to oil exposure (concentration and duration). These abnormalities were directly reflected in the reduced hatching success (as little as 25 per cent under the worst conditions). The percentage of larvae surviving the two moults to become juveniles was also considerably reduced, while the survival of juveniles at the sublethal experimental levels was found to be directly linked to their history of exposure. It is anticipated that C. kraussi populations, because of several unusual features in their breeding ecology, would suffer long-term damage should the extent of larval recruitment to adult populations be reduced as a result of chronic exposure to oil.",

These decades of increased measuring capability, precision and analysis have also provided experience with failed short-term projections of climate, ocean and subsequent ecological responses. The problems have resulted primarily from insufficient contextual information and overindulgence in limited statistical approaches. The resulting atmospheric, oceanographic and resource-conservation sciences will some day be viewed as anti-existential groping for instant enlightenment and quick solutions to poorly understood and defined problems. The data-driven, computerized sciences still await the maturation of the observers and their insights into their respective areas of expertise. While recent generations of modellers and managers have searched for quick tools to justify decisions that could be made on far less rigorous bases, some empiricists have diligently compiled facts and made collaborative interpretations that can not only provide insights into the status and trends within larger ecosystem contexts, but also provide the pieces of the larger global puzzle that must be resolved. Examples of the various interlocking scales, and related patches and edges of the emerging picture are described, as are suggestions for how the shorter-term, anecdotal efforts of ocean scientists might be brought into focus for placement within these larger contexts.",

Distribution densities are ranked according to three selected grades. The data are discussed in relation to the oceanography of the region as well as to previously documented spawning and larval distributions. Conclusions are drawn which may help in understanding the migration patterns of anchovy off Namibia. Adults occupy winter feeding grounds in the north and move out to the spawning grounds between the Cunene River and Hollams Bird Island in summer. Post-larvae are transported passively to the nursery areas where they feed and develop. Juveniles move north in autumn to the preferred feeding grounds around Walvis Bay, where they enter the fishery as recruits in winter. At the end of winter, they join the adults in the north. The inferred pattern would be advantageous to both feeding adults and juvenile anchovy, while also avoiding competition between the two components for food resources. This fits classical theory, but there are limitations to the data.",

Actual daily production (P24 meas) was obtained from a series of short-term (3—4 h) incubations spanning 24 hours. Daily production was also extrapolated from single measurements during daylight by the \"time factor\" and \"light factor\" methods of calculation. These estimates (P24 calc) vary considerably from P24 meas, but on average they underestimate daily production. Estimates by the \"light factor\" method are generally lower and more variable than those from the \"time factor\" method. Differences in amplitude and timing of fluctuations in the rate of net production during daylight make it impossible to calculate reliable factors for correcting diel variations in photosynthesis when estimating daily production from short-term measurements. It is suggested that the effects of diel variation in production are likely to be less significant in the euphotic zone as a whole than at the sea surface alone.",

Consideration of available hydro-acoustic survey data, environmental data and egg counts led to the conclusion that the decline in shoal abundance was brought about by a southward migration of shoals, and that the migration was possibly triggered by environmental changes between January and February 1982. The implied time lag of 14—32 days is difficult to explain, but it could have been a consequence of favourable spawning conditions which still prevailed during February, coupled with the development of dense phytoplankton to the south of the survey area during March.",

The effects of increasing desiccation on net photosynthesis and respiration after re-immersion were also determined. Up to 25°C, both under immersed and emersed conditions, net photosynthesis increased with an increase in temperature, with generally higher rates under immersed conditions. However, at 30°C under immersed conditions, the rate decreased to the values at 25 and 30°C under emersion. Respiration did not follow the same trends. With increase in temperature above 20°C there was a significant increase in respiration and, at all temperatures, respiration rates were significantly higher under emersed than under immersed conditions. Increased levels of desiccation caused significant reductions in net photosynthesis and respiration. After re-immersion, rates of both photosynthesis and respiration were proportional to those at the previous level of desiccation. The low rates of net photosynthesis with emersion and concomitant desiccation may explain the restriction of this species to the lower shore all along the coast.",

The aircraft flew a grid pattern extending 30 km inland and about 100 km offshore. Wind data were obtained from aircraft drift measurements at 152 m above sea or local ground level. A time series of wind information from a coastal station in the centre of the study area showed a longshore wind direction (170°) with a slight onshore component due to the prevalence of seabreezes. The South Atlantic high-pressure cell and equatorward wind flow became established during October 1980. However, in November a persistent upper-air trough caused wind reversals affecting the distribution of sea surface temperature. Upwelling off Namaqualand is typically confined to the coastal strip, but with a broad plume of cold water extending offshore near 30°S. The location of the minima in sea surface temperature is attributed to the proximity of a southerly wind maximum and to an equatorward broadening of the continental shelf. Three cases are presented to describe the pattern of upwelling off Namaqualand under a varying history of winds.",

Temporal variability in the wind cycle on the Agulhas Bank during the period 1981–1996 was deduced mainly from trends in the pressure gradient, measured from south of Cape Agulhas (35°S) to the region of westwind drift (40°S). Because interannual deviations in the catch rates differed between seasons, catch rates were assessed by season. Coastal catch rates of Agulhas sole between Cape Agulhas and Cape Infanta were high in autumn and winter, when offshore north-westerly winds prevailed, and low in spring and late summer, when onshore south-easterly winds dominated. There was often a secondary peak in catch rates in November–December, coincident with a midsummer change in the pressure gradient. Between the period 1982 and 1996, catch rates in autumn and early winter (April–July) were highest during years when the winter north-westerly winds were strongest (r 2 = 0.62, p < 0.01). Catch rates usually peaked in May–June. This pattern changed in some years, depending on the timing and rate of change to winter wind conditions. Seasonal and interannual fluctuations in catch rate are associated with deviations in the wind field, but the mechanism whereby this effect is mediated remains unknown.",

The major sectors of the domestic industry face a capital replacement crisis that renders them particularly vulnerable at this stage in their development. Considering that the main pressures arise from a dearth of suitable information on which to base business decisions, the scientific community is able to make a very real contribution. Unfortunately, the information gap is not usually bridged, because it is not generally perceived that data collected within the rigorous academic tradition in which the scientific community operates is well in excess of the accuracy and predictive power sufficient for the commercial sector.",

No authentic examples of this taxon have been found in South African herbaria. These specimens, though superficially alike, show anatomical differences that separate them taxonomically; these are fully described. Existing accounts of C. filiformis are inadequate to permit the positive association of either of the specimens recently recovered with it. Both forms have superficial resemblances to the type of the genus, C. costata (Stackh.) Batt., to which C. filiformis might be assigned. However, it is apparent that current concepts of C. costata may be too broad and more detailed studies are needed — both of the various taxa thought to be conspecific and of regional forms.",

To investigate a possible influence of environmental conditions on availability of chub mackerel to purse-seiners, prewhitened residuals of catches were correlated with prewhitened residuals of sea surface temperature and wind for three areas off South Africa. Statistically significant correlations for the two southern areas were only marginally greater than the number that would have been expected to have arisen spuriously. However, catches appear to be significantly related to cool sea surface temperatures and north-westerly winds in the northern area. These responses may indicate the preferred habitat of the prey (cooler water temperatures) and/or availability of the resource to the fishing fleet (north-westerly winds push the upwelling front closer inshore). The best purse-seine catches of the older ages of chub mackerel have followed a south-westerly movement of these age-classes into the fishing grounds. If the extent of this movement is modulated by environmental conditions in the north, there may be benefit in purse-seiners extending their search for older chub mackerel northwards and offshore.",
