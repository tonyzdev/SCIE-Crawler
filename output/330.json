    "abstract": "The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is the most important noctuid pest in the Americas and has recently become an invasive pest in Africa. A detailed record of S. frugiperda's host plants is essential to better understand the biology and ecology of this pest, conduct future studies, and develop Integrated Pest Management programmes. In this study, we collected and systematically arranged the fragmented bibliographic information on S. frugiperda feeding records. Furthermore, we registered new records of host plants for S. frugiperda based on eight years of surveys in Brazil. The literature review and surveys resulted in a total of 353 S. frugiperda larval host plant records belonging to 76 plant families, principally Poaceae (106), Asteraceae (31) and Fabaceae (31). The literature search revealed 274 (77 % of total) bibliographic records, while 82 (23 %) are new records from surveys in Brazil. The new comprehensive and updated host plant list will improve our understanding of pest biology and management, as well as facilitate future studies on this pest.",

Post-release evaluations over the last three years have shown that, with the exception of water hyacinth, all of these problematic aquatic plants have been suppressed effectively using classical biological control. In eutrophic water bodies at high elevations that experience cold winters, an integrated approach, that includes herbicide application and augmentive biological control, is required against water hyacinth. The grasshopper Cornops aquaticum (Brüner) (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Leptysminae) has recently been released as a new agent for water hyacinth, and Megamelus scutellaris Berg (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) and Taosa longula Remes Lenicov (Hemiptera: Dictyopharidae) are being considered for release on water hyacinth. The longterm management of alien aquatic plants in South Africa relies on the prevention of new introductions of aquatic plant species that could replace those that have been controlled, and, more importantly, on a reduction in nutrient levels in South Africa's aquatic ecosystems.",

However, a major constraint to growing field horticultural crops is the reduction in yield and quality caused by insect pests by direct feeding or as plant disease vectors (James et al. 2010; Ekesi et al. 2011). Chemical control is the main control strategy implemented by growers to cope with insect pests (Ngowi et al. 2007; Grzywacz et al. 2010). Extensive and sometimes inappropriate use of chemical insecticides to control insect pests increases production costs and negatively impacts food safety (residues), human health and environment, especially biodiversity and beneficial arthropods (Desneux et al. 2007; Biondi et al. 2012). The implementation of effective and ecologically-sound integrated pest management (IPM) strategies is needed to develop sustainable vegetable production.",

    "abstract": "This review is a summary of developments that have contributed to the success of several biological control programmes against invasive cactus species (Cactaceae) that have been worked on in South Africa over the last 12 years. Six potential biological control agents have been identified for the control of Pereskia aculeata Mil. and molecular studies have identified the origin of the South African P. aculeata population. Host-specificity testing is now required for the three most promising of these agents. The successful biological control programme against Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw. has resulted in a change in management strategies against this weed in the Kruger National Park and the control of O. stricta is now almost entirely reliant on biological control. Taxonomic problems associated with the identification of Cylindropuntia fulgida var. fulgida (Engelm.) F.M.Knuth var. fulgida have been resolved and an appropriate cochineal insect (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae) biotype has been released, resulting in substantial declines in Cyl. fulgida var. fulgida populations. A long-term monitoring programme has been initiated to evaluate the progress of this new cochineal insect biotype. The Harrisia mealybug, Hypogeococcus pungens Granara de Willink (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), which was originally released on Harrisia martinii (Labour.) Britton & Rose has been collected and redistributed onto Cereus jamacaru DC., where it reduces fruit production and leads to the death of both seedlings and large plants. Resolving taxonomic problems to ensure the correct identification of plant species and the most appropriate biological control biotypes have been key issues that have led to the successful control of several cactaceous weed species in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "This catalogue provides a comprehensive record of the 284 entities of organisms (insect, mite and pathogen species, or biotypes thereof) that have featured in biological control of invasive alien plants (weeds) in South Africa, since 1913. Fourteen of these entities are native species, or foreign species that have, by some unknown means, entered the country, while the remainder were intentionally imported specifically for biological control. The majority (237 of 284, i.e. 83 %) are phytophagous insects, the balance being made up of five species of mites (Acari) and 42 entities of plant-pathogens. The catalogue comprises the names of each of the target weeds, their origin, and an assessment of the degree of control that has been achieved with biological control, together with names and details (feeding guild, date released where applicable, current status and extent of damage inflicted) for each of the agents. Key references are provided. Of the 270 entities that were introduced into quarantine and tested for host specificity: 106 (39 %) were eventually released as biological control agents; 16 % are still under investigation; approximately 24 % were rejected by researchers because of doubts about their safety or efficacy; and 21 % have been shelved pending possible further study. Two of the pathogen species were developed as mycoherbicides. Seventy-five (71 %) of the 106 agents that were released in South Africa have become established on 48 invasive alien plant species, in 14 plant families. According to a rating system that has been widely adopted since 1999, and slightly amended in this account, approximately 21 % of the weed species on which biological control agents are established have been completely controlled, and another 38 % are under a substantial degree of control.",

During the last ten years, considerable effort has been directed at searching for new agents in Australia and in collecting additional material to bolster populations of recently-established agents in South Africa. Concurrently, ongoing evaluation studies in South Africa have measured the dynamics of the introduced agents as well as their impact on the vigour and fecundity of their host plants and the extent to which their damage is reducing the density, distribution and invasiveness of the Acacia species. Progress with all of these projects is reviewed.",

Other potential agents have been identified, including nine beetle species, four moths and a gall midge. Of these, a straight-snouted weevil, Coelocephalapion gandolfoi Kissinger (Coleoptera: Brentidae: Apioninae), whose larvae attack seeds within green pods, is considered especially promising and has been subjected to host-range tests.

Some pathogens have been considered, as either classical biological control agents or as mycoherbicides. Ongoing debates about the relative value and costs of the trees continue to hamper progress with the planned escalation of biological control. Recent assessments show that the costs of mesquite will soon outweigh the benefits in most situations, opening opportunities to clear additional agent species for release. The results of studies since 1999 on the established and the prospective agents on mesquite are reviewed, while considering the issues that need to be addressed to enable the biological control programme to proceed.",

The understanding of impacts and their economic costs is far from perfect, but estimates indicate that some costs (of lost water, grazing and biodiversity) are currently about R6.5 billion per annum (about 0.3 % of South Africa's GDP of around R2000 billion: R7 = about US$1), and could rise to > 5 % of GDP if invasive plants are allowed to reach their full potential. By comparing the costs of biological control research and implementation to the benefits of restored ecosystem services, or avoided costs, and avoided ongoing control costs, biological control has been shown to be extremely beneficial in economic terms: estimated benefit:cost ratios ranged from 8:1 up to 3726:1. Currently, spending on biological control is far lower than on other forms of control (about 5 % and 14 % of that spent on mechanical and chemical control, respectively), despite the significantly better returns on investment from biological control. In aggregate these assessments indicate that higher levels of spending on biological control research would generate extremely attractive returns on investment.",

Reasons are given for viewing the whole array of invasive taxa within Lantana L. sect. Camara Cham. (Verbenaceae) as a syngameon, and for surveying natural enemies of camara-like Lantana entities between Florida and Uruguay. To improve the degree of biological control of lantana, additional agents have been selected, evaluated and found suitable for release in South Africa. The quarantine evaluation and current status of 30 candidate biological control agents obtained from the New World is summarized. Of these, seven were found to be suitable for release, according to given criteria, and two new agents, Aceria lantanae (Cook) (Acari: Eriophyidae) and Ophiomyia camarae Spencer (Diptera: Agromyzidae), are improving control of lantana in humid, frost-free areas. No significant non-target effects have been detected. Information on the distribution and abundance of 17 agents and lantanaassociated insects established in South Africa is presented: several are mainly coastal and they are scarce overall. Agent proliferation is constrained by a combination of climatic incompatibility, acquired natural enemies and, probably, the broad spectrum of allelochemicals present in the allopolyploid hybrids within the L. camara complex. In the case of lantana, biological control plays a subsidiary role in support of essential mechanicalplus-chemical control. Cost benefits justify the continued development of additional agents.",

(Asteraceae) in South Africa is described in this review. The origin of the southern African C. odorata biotype has been determined as the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean. Regions of the Neotropics which are climatically similar to the area invaded by the weed in southern Africa have been identified, allowing for better climatic matching of potential biological control agents. Two insect agents, Pareuchaetes insulata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), which was released in 2001, and Calycomyza eupatorivora Spencer (Diptera: Agromyzidae), released in 2003, have become established on C. odorata in South Africa, primarily in the wetter, coastal regions. While these agents have inflicted sporadic, localized damage on the weed, it is clear that their impact on C. odorata populations will be insufficient to effect adequate suppression of the weed throughout its invasive range in South Africa. Thus, research on a wide range of insect and pathogen species which have potential as biological control agents has been ongoing. Initial releases of a stem-boring weevil, Lixus aemulus Petri (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), have been made, and host-range testing of the shoot-tip borer Dichrorampha odorata Brown & Zachariades (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) indicates that it is suitable for release. The root feeder Longitarsus sp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) was rejected because it was shown to have a wide host range. Four promising insect species are currently being investigated, namely the stem galler Conotrachelus reticulatus Champion (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the stem borer Carmenta chromolaenae Eichlin (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), the stem and root-crown borer Recchia parvula (Lane) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and the shoot-tip borer Melanagromyza eupatoriella Spencer (Diptera: Agromyzidae). Sustained efforts have been made to collect and isolate pathogens from C. odorata in the Americas, but all pathogens either failed to produce symptoms or were insufficiently virulent on the southern African biotype of the target plant. Although considerable efforts and resources have been expended on research and implementation of biological control against C. odorata, the plant is not yet under any significant degree of biological control in South Africa and it continues to be a weed of national and international importance.",

    "abstract": "Any new alien insect that succeeds in reaching and establishing in South Africa is a cause for concern, especially if it is phytophagous and feeds on commercially important plants. It is important that this should be detected early and documented so that the status of the insect as a pest can be assessed. Where necessary, the agricultural sector, trading partners and neighbouring countries should be alerted and consideration given to the possibility of eradication. The rate at which these insects establish in a region gives an indication of the adequacy of phytosanitary procedures which are aimed at preventing this. The aim of this paper is to draw attention to the number of alien insect species (excluding pet insects and those introduced for the biological control of pest insects and weeds) which have recently (arbitrarily the last 12 years) established in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province, and to consider possible pathways by which they have entered the country. Indications are that new introductions are taking place at an alarming rate, pointing to deficiencies in the regulatory procedures and constraints faced by the South African regulatory system.",

    "abstract": "Since its humble beginnings in the late 1990s, use of the sterile insect technique (SIT) in South African crop agriculture evolved from an underfunded 'rag and bones' operation in Stellenbosch for a single pest, Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), on deciduous fruit and table grapes, to privatized programmes for three fruit pests, viz. Medfly, false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick)) on citrus, and codling moth (Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus)) on apples and pears.Afourth SIT programme, for the sugarcane stalkborers, Eldana saccharina Walker and Chilo sacchariphagus Bojer, is well under development. This review focuses mainly on the Medfly SIT programme, but gives brief summaries of the development and current status of SIT for the other pests mentioned. However, many of the hardships experienced by the Medfly SIT programme have also been experienced by those people that developed, or are still developing SIT for the other pests. During the last 15 years the Medfly programme has passed through many phases and evoked many emotions, including hope, despair, misunderstanding and mistrust; but it also bred perseverance, determination, empowerment and, later, confidence. It has also included an international DNA investigation to identify the origin of a Medfly outbreak in the SIT area. The Medfly SIT programme started at Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Infruitec-Nietvoorbij in Stellenbosch in the Western Cape Province with a feasibility study over some 5000 ha of table grapes in theHex RiverValley area, releasing by air 5 million sterile male Medflies per week, produced in a run-down outbuilding with questionable equipment. Fungal rot, ant invasions, severe rust, lack of funding, inexperience and ignorance were among the challenges. The feasibility project subsequently metamorphosed into a fully-fledged, privatized programme which now produces 25 million sterile male Medflies per week in a modern, state-of-the-art facility with high-specification equipment and highly qualified technicians, distributed weekly to three different production areas and released on the ground. The current objective of the Medfly SIT programme is population suppression, but this is merely a means to an end. Medfly is regarded as a pest of international quarantine importance, and a number of countries impose strict phytosanitary measures against this pest. The ultimate goal, therefore, is the creation of Medfly-free areas, leading to sustained and expanded international fruit markets without trade restrictions due to Medfly. Many challenges still remain, but there is a fierce determination by those involved that it will succeed. In the meantime, the false codling moth SIT programme, based in Citrusdal in the Western Cape Province, is very successful and has improved and expanded significantly. The pilot release phase of the sugarcane borer SIT programme is expected to be fast-tracked after the likely procurement of an irradiator in KwaZulu-Natal in 2015. However, for economic and other reasons the codling moth SIT programme had to be terminated in 2014. 'Will SIT in South Africa fly?' It is already flying, but it needs to fly much higher. With the necessity to export fruit from pest-free areas, to minimize crop losses of commercial and small-scale farmers, and considering the large investments already made in SIT in South Africa, there should be no going back.",

Wax moth eggs were placed on each diet and larvae that developed therefrom were weighed after 51 days. A diet containing 118 g wheat flour, 206 g wheat bran, 118 g milk powder, 88 g brewer's yeast, 24 g wax powder, 175 ml honey and 175 ml glycerol, produced the heaviest larvae, with an average weight of 0.19 g per larva. Mealworms were weighed 62 days after adult beetles were placed on the various diets. The heaviest larvae were produced on a diet consisting of wheat bran only, with each larva weighing, on average, 0.0154 g. Nematode production of Heterorhabditis zealandica and H. bacteriophora using wax moth, mealworm, codling moth (Cydia pomonella) and false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta) larvae were determined, as well as was the correlation between the weight of the host larvae and that of the nematode progeny produced. Wax moth larvae produced the highest number of H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora per g of host. The mean number of H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora infective juveniles produced were 1 459 205 and 1 898 512, respectively, per g of host. The mean number of H. zealandica produced per g of codling moth and false codling moth larvae was 57 582 and 192 867, respectively. Lower mean numbers were produced for codling moth and false codling moth larvae when using H. bacteriophora, with 39 653 and 97 652 nematodes produced per g of the respective hosts. A significant positive linear relationship existed between weight of wax moth larvae and that of mealworm and the number of nematodes produced. Using frozen hosts of wax moth larvae and mealworm, comparable reproduction of nematodes was only found with mealworm.",

Current FCM control strategies include the use of chemical insecticides. However, FCM has developed resistance to some of the insecticides, and stringent chemical residue restrictions have been imposed by some foreign markets. Thus, the demand for high-quality fruit has translated into a need for new, efficient and effective integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. One such strategy is the control of the soil-dwelling life stages of FCM, using entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF). Both of the biocontrol agents concerned have individually been shown to be effective against FCM. However, it is possible that, if they are applied simultaneously, a synergistic relationship might be observed between EPNs and EPF that could serve to enhance their efficacy against the target pest. In addition to reviewing previous and current control options against FCM in South African fruit crops, this study investigates the potential for using EPNs and EPF individually, and in combination, as biological control agents against FCM within an IPM system.",

The current catalogue reorders and separates data for exotic natural enemies that have been approved as classical biocontrol agents, from those on exotic natural enemies that have been considered but not released, exotic natural enemies that have been inadvertently introduced into South Africa with host plants that include target weed species, and locally sourced natural enemies that have been considered as bioherbicides. Ninety weed species have been targeted for biocontrol, with 310 exotic natural enemies considered, 136 classified as de jure or de facto classical biocontrol agents, and 92 established in the field on 66 target weeds. Ten of these species were found to have established independently of being released while research on them was in progress. An additional six exotic species have been found established on target weeds, and 11 locally sourced natural enemies have been considered for inundative or augmentative biocontrol, of which two have been developed commercially. Of the exotic natural enemies deliberately established, 35% inflict extensive damage to their host plants. Insects make up the majority of biocontrol agents (90%), with the balance of 8% being fungi and 2%, mites. Both establishment rates and damage levels vary between taxa. Five biocontrol agents previously considered established, have not been found in the field for several years and their persistence is in doubt. Outcomes of biocontrol at a plant population level are indicated for 54 target weeds on which agents have been established for over a decade. The increase in numbers of target weeds considered, as well as biocontrol agents released, over the past decade, has been enabled by continued generous funding and an efficient release-approval process.",

A biological control programme was begun within the first year with the importation of the Kamona strain of the parasitic nematode, Deladenus siricidicola, which had originally been imported into Australia from Hungary. In 1995 and 1996 a total of 70 million nematodes were imported and inoculated into 296 S. noctilio-infested trees in a 90km arc around Cape Town. The parasitism rate increased from 22.6% in 1996, to 54% in 1997, and 96.1% in 1998. The early larval parasitoid, Ibalia leucospoides, was imported into South Africa in 1998 from Uruguay, where it had arrived with its S. noctilio host. A total of 456 parasitoids was released in plantations from Cape Town to Riversdale from 1998-2001. By 2002 it was confirmed to be established at Stellenbosch. Megarhyssa nortoni, a late larval parasitoid originally from North America, was imported from Australia into South Africa in 1998 and 38 mated females were released on the Gifberg overlooking Vanrhynsdorp a year later. No recoveries from this site have been made and it is unknown whether it has become established. Since 1994, the numbers of the European cerambycid, Arhopalus syriacus, had increased because they were able to breed in the lower trunk of trees killed by S. noctilio. Their numbers have since declined with those of S. noctilio following the introduction of the natural enemies. At no stage did the loss of trees exceed 3.2% of a Pinus compartment and effective biological control was achieved during this period within the southwestern Cape.",

Correlation was obtained between the attraction of beetles to colour-traps and the colours of host-plant flowers. Three pollinator guilds were defined on colour preferences and feeding behaviour. A blue/white pollinator guild comprising species of Anisonyx Fabricius and Peritrichia Burmeister were attracted to blue and white traps, and pollinated blue-violet and white flowers. These beetles feed on pollen (and possibly on nectar) and do not imbed themselves in flowers. This, together with their dense pilosity and frequent flower visitation rates, suggests that they are important pollinators. A second embedding guild consists of the genera Scelophysa Gyllenhal, Heterochelus Burmeister, Gymnoloma peringuey, Heterochelus Burmeister and Pachycnema Burmeister. These beetles show pronounced sexual dimorphism and are relatively free of hair. They characteristically embed in species of Asteraceae and Mesembryanthemaceae, feeding on the ray florets, ovule and pollen. They probably have a limited role as pollinators. A third pollen-feeding guild is intermediate between these two guilds. It comprises species of Lepithrix Serville which, like the members of the embedding guild, select red, yellow, orange and white pigments and flowers. They do not embed, but feed superficially on pollen of Asteraceae. They are numerous, active and densely pilose, features indicating that they play an important role as pollinators.",

Deliberate biological control efforts have been confined to South Africa, although these have been opportunistic, unfunded and, given the plant's propensity for prolific seed production, have focused exclusively on the seed beetle, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae).

Biological control efforts spanning 26 years have previously been confined to South Africa, but have recently been extended to New Zealand. The weed is a particularly challenging target for biological control, largely because of its taxonomic relatedness to economically important and native plant species which resulted in the rejection or shelving of the majority of candidate agents tested thus far. Despite these problems, two insect agents, the sap-sucking Gargaphia decoris Drake (Hemiptera: Tingidae) and flowerbud-feeding Anthonomus santacruzi Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), have been released in South Africa. Gargaphia decoris was first released in 1999 and has become established in several regions of the country. Although large outbreaks and extensive damage have been observed in the field, to date these have been erratic and insufficient to inflict meaningful damage on the weed populations. Anthonomus santacruzi was released in early 2009 and so far appears to have established at two sites in KwaZulu-Natal. This paper is a review of the biological control programme against S. mauritianum in South Africa, including (i) aspects of the weed that are pertinent to its invasiveness and management, (ii) the current status of the two prominent insect agents, and (iii) the direction of future research efforts.",

A proposal to use biological control to contain the problem raised concerns among foresters who immediately identified a number of difficulties that could arise for the forestry industry if biological control agents were to be introduced. As a compromise, plans were made to target, initially at least, two pine species, Pinus pinaster Alton and Pinus halepensis Mill, that currently have no commercial value. A cone-feeding weevil from Portugal, Pissodes validirostris Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), was identified as the most promising agent. Formerly regarded as a single species, extensive preparatory studies revealed that there are several different forms (perhaps a complex of sibling species) of P. validirostris each associated with different pine species in different regions of Europe. Screening tests in arboreta in France showed that the prospective agent was host-specific enough to be used with safety in South Africa. Despite this positive finding, the programme did not proceed much further because subsequent trials in quarantine in South Africa showed that damage caused by the adult weevils feeding on leader shoots of pines allowed ingress of pitch canker, Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg and O'Donnell (Hypocreales: Nectriaceae), an increasingly problematic pathogen in pine forests in South Africa. However, given the escalating negative consequences of pine tree invasions, especially in the Cape Floral Region, the question of whether or not this biological control programme should have been discontinued in 2009 remains open for debate and the opposing views on the subject are presented.",

A stem-galling moth Epiblema strenuana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), seed-feeding weevil Smicronyx lutulentus Dietz (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and stem-boring moth Carmenta nr. ithacae (Beutenmüller) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) are also under consideration. Studies conducted in South Africa prior to the release of biological control agents, demonstrated an extensive, but highly variable, soil seed bank. In 2005, the South African biological control programme was extended to Ethiopia through an international cooperative programme. Parthenium has the potential to become more widespread and problematic in sub-Saharan Africa, and the implementation of biological control could assist in reducing this risk.",

    "abstract": "Historically, biological control efforts against aquatic plants in South Africa have focused on floating species, and as a result, there has been a dearth of research into the invasion and control of submerged macrophytes. With numerous submerged invasive species already established in South Africa, thriving horticultural and aquarium industries, nutrient-rich water systems, and a limited knowledge of the drivers of invasions of submerged macrophytes, South Africa is highly vulnerable to a second phase of aquatic plant problems. Experience gained in the U.S.A. on biological control against submerged weeds, such as hydrilla, Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle (Hydrocharitaceae) and spiked/Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum L. (Haloragaceae), have provided South African researchers with the necessary foundation to initiate programmes against these weeds. Research in South Africa is currently focused on pre-release studies on the biological control of H. verticillata, using an undescribed fly, Hydrellia sp. (Diptera: Ephydridae) and a weevil, Bagous hydrillae O'Brien (Coleoptera: Curculionidae); and on M. spicatum using a North American weevil, Euhrychiopsis lecontei Dietz (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Feasibility studies into biological control of some incipient submerged weeds are also being conducted, including Brazilian water weed, Egeria densa Planch. (Hydrocharitaceae), Canadian water weed, Elodea canadensis Mitch. (Hydrocharitaceae) and cabomba, Cabomba caroliniana A.Gray (Cabombaceae). Progress with, and potential constraints that may limit these programmes, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) represent an important part of the spectrum of potentially available biological control agents against insect pests. EPNs of the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae share a mutualistic relationship with bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, respectively. Current research on the use of EPNs against key pests of fruit crops in South Africa has the ultimate aim of using nematodes on a commercial scale against key insect pests of such fruit crops as deciduous fruit and citrus. For this objective to be realized, nematodes should be mass produced in vitro in liquid culture. A detailed understanding of the biology and behaviour of the nematode species and the associated bacterial symbiont in relation to their mass production is, therefore, required. The long processing time that is required for nematode cultures, combined with the need for an even distribution of fluids and organisms, result in the cultures being extremely vulnerable to contamination. Nematodes experience a very different environment in liquid culture than they do in nature, and a high level of technological knowledge is required for their successful production. Endemic EPNs are not currently commercially produced in South Africa. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge that is available on the bacterial symbionts and on the biology of the two nematode genera. Optimum growth parameters for the bacteria and the nematodes are discussed for endemic nematode isolates that might have the potential to be mass cultured for commercial application.",

The essential oils were extracted and their chemical composition was identified using a GC Ultra-ISQ mass spectrometer. The results showed that there were highly significant differences between all treatments and the control in some biological aspects. The larval and pupal duration was significantly prolonged, also pupal weight increased for all treatments when compared to the control. The percentage of hatchability of deposited eggs was significantly decreased, especially when using ginger both oil extracts at LC50 concentration. On the other hand, the pupation percentage, rate of adult emergence, sex ratio and female fecundity were not significantly affected by all applications. The catalase enzyme (CAT) activity showed significant difference only at LC50 of ginger oil.",

    "abstract": "Reservoir host plants can play a critical role in the maintenance and spread of invasive agricultural insect pests, particularly when the pest species attacks a wide range of host plants, is ecologically plastic and demonstrates high reproductive fitness. The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), fits well within this category of alien pests. Indeed, this moth has become, in a very short period, the main phytosanitary factor limiting tomato production in the world. In addition, it is becoming a potential pest of potato crops. Among reported host weeds of this insect, Solanum nigrum L., Datura stramonium L. and Datura ferox L. are widely distributed in both T. absoluta's original geographical range and in newly infested areas. In this paper, we assess the suitability of these three plants as alternate hosts for T. absoluta. Development time of juvenile instars, adult longevity and female fecundity of the pest reared on these weeds were compared with those observed on tomato and potato plants under laboratory conditions. The study revealed that T. absoluta did not oviposit and develop on either D. stramonium or D. ferox. Conversely, tomato leafminers reared on S. nigrum (black nightshade) exhibited a reproductive fitness comparable with that seen on potato. All the investigated parameters confirmed that tomato is the most suitable host plant for the pest. These findings highlight the potential of the black nightshade to act as a reservoir host for T. absoluta and the carryover of its populations in periods when neither tomato nor potato crops are available.",

    "abstract": "False codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa and infests a large number of commercial and wild fruit-bearing plants. The pest was unknown in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa until the end of the 1960s, when it was first identified in fruit orchards in the Paarl region. By the late 1970s T. leucotreta was well established on citrus and other host plants in the Olifants River Valley, approximately 180 km north of Paarl. Since then, control measures for the pest included a small number of insecticides, mating disruption and orchard sanitation. However, a longer termsolution was needed and research on the sterile insect technique was initiated in 2002. This initially involved three phases: a study of the radiation biology and F1 sterility of T. leucotreta (phase 1), field cage experiments (phase 2) and a pilot project over 35 ha of T. leucotreta-susceptible citrus (phase 3). Favourable results in these studies led to the design and construction of T. leucotreta-specific rearing equipment and the building of a massrearing facility capable of producing up to 21 million insects per week (phase 4). Commercial sterile insect releases over 1500 ha of citrus orchards in the Citrusdal region commenced in 2007–08. This area was expanded to 3000 ha in 2008–09 and 4000 hectares in 2009–10 (phase 5). Over the three years the status of T. leucotreta as a pest threat was systematically reduced in the sterile insect release area compared to the non-release area. Feral male populations were reduced 3-, 8- and 10-fold, pre-harvest crop losses decreased by 50 %, 80%and 93 %, and post-harvest export fruit rejections in the SIT area dropped 13 %, 25 % and 38 %, respectively, compared to the non-SIT area.",

    "abstract": "Biological control (biocontrol) against invasive macrophytes is one of the longest standing programmes in South Africa, initiated in the 1970s against water hyacinth, Pontederia crassipes Mart. (Pontederiaceae). Since then, 15 agent species (13 insects, one mite and one pathogen) have been released against six weeds, most of which are floating macrophytes, with excellent levels of success. The release of the water hyacinth planthopper Megamelus scutellaris Berg (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in particular, has improved biocontrol prospects for water hyacinth since 2018. In the last decade, however, a new suite of submerged and rooted emergent invasive macrophytes has been targeted. The first release against a submerged macrophyte in South Africa, and the first release against Brazilian waterweed, Egeria densa Planch. (Hydrocharitaceae), anywhere in the world, was achieved with the release of a leafmining fly, Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues-Júnior, Mathis & Hauser (Diptera: Ephydridae). Yellow flag, Iris pseudacorus L. (Iridaceae) and Mexican waterlily, Nymphaea mexicana Zucc. (Nymphaeaceae), have also been targeted for biocontrol for the first time worldwide, and are in the early stages of agent development. Post-release evaluations, long term monitoring and controlled experiments have highlighted the need for a more holistic approach to managing aquatic invasive plants in South Africa, whose presence is largely driven by eutrophication, resulting in regime shifts between floating and submerged invaded states.",

    "abstract": "Cactaceae are among the most problematic invasive alien plants in South Africa, posing serious negative consequences to agriculture and natural ecosystems. Fortunately, South Africa has a long and successful history of controlling cactus weeds using biological control (biocontrol). This paper reviews all the biocontrol programmes against invasive alien Cactaceae in South Africa, focusing on the decade since the last review published in 2011, up to, and including 2020. Biocontrol programmes against 16 target weeds are summarised, all of which rely on either the galling mealybug, Hypogeococcus sp. (Pseudococcidae), or various species or intraspecific lineages of cochineal insects (Dactylopius spp., Dactylopiidae) as agents. New agents are being considered for the three target weed species, Opuntia elata Salm-Dyck, Opuntia megapotamica Arechav. and Trichocereus spachianus (Lem.) Riccob., while permission to release a new agent against Cylindropuntia pallida (Rose) F.M. Knuth has recently been granted. The biocontrol agent, Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockrell) 'stricta', which has been utilised for the successful control of Opuntia stricta Haw., has shown some promise as an agent against one of the worst cactus weeds in the country, the North Cape/Free State variety of Opuntia engelmannii Salm-Dyck. Post-release monitoring and recent observations of the status of control for the 11 other cactus weeds, all of which have well-established agents, are provided. Taxonomic uncertainties and misidentifications of both target weeds and agents has been a constraint to biocontrol efforts, but this has been partially overcome through the use of genetic techniques. Biocontrol is particularly successful in controlling cactus weeds compared to most other taxonomic groups, and it is likely that past successes can be repeated with new target weeds. Mass-rearing and redistribution of agents are essential to gain the maximum possible benefit from cactus biocontrol agents, and recent increases in mass-rearing outputs have been beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The Prince Edward Islands form a unique component of South Africa's natural estate. Here we present an overview of the diversity of the invertebrate fauna found on Marion and Prince Edward Islands and the conservation threats facing it. The invertebrate fauna at the islands is well known owing to a significant recent effort to sample the entire fauna, although the nematodes remain poorly known. Mite, insect and springtail assemblages differ considerably between habitats and these patterns support an earlier distinction made between the epilithic and vegetated biotopes. Seasonal variation in the abundances of the arthropods is the norm, although the form of this seasonality varies considerably between species and between habitats. Froma regional perspective, the biogeographic affinities of the fauna remain enigmatic. Nonetheless, it seems likely that isolation has been an important contributor to local, indigenous species richness on Marion Island, and speciation has clearly contributed several endemic species to the fauna. Introduced insect species richness is more closely related to mean annual temperature and the number of humans occupying islands in the sub-Antarctic region, and this pattern is reflected locally in the distribution of indigenous and exotic springtails on Marion Island. The introduced species are common in warm, moist habitats, while the indigenous species prefer colder, drier sites. Local climate change, in step with global trends, seems set to have pronounced influences on the invertebrate fauna. Direct effects are likely to take the form of increased abundances of introduced species because of their shorter life cycles and greater fecundity compared to indigenous species, which tend to be long-lived with low reproductive output. Indirect effects are likely to be the result of changes in predation patterns of introduced house mice, and changes in plant communities precipitated by the spread of invasive vascular plants, which in turn have a marked influence on invertebrate assemblages. Undoubtedly the largest conservation threats at the island are the interactions between climate change, introduced species, and human use. In particular, climate change is likely to mean the ready establishment of alien species propagules, while increasing human use is likely to increase propagule pressure. Conservation of the invertebrates at the island will best be served by reduction in human use and stringent enforcement of the provisions of the management plan for these special nature reserves.",

    "abstract": "Dung beetles are useful as indicators in conservation and global warming studies owing to their specialized regional and local distribution patterns. However, existing South African data are inadequate for indication at the necessary degree of spatial resolution. To improve the database, survey methods need to be designed according to the spatial and temporal factors that influence dung beetle diversity. Across four major climatic regions, there are seven principal species distribution centres for dung beetles in which activity is influenced primarily by differences in rainfall seasonality and temperature. Across these regions, generic endemism is largely concentrated around the coastline and in montane areas. The conservation status of endemic genera is discussed. At a local scale, spatial diversity is influenced primarily by soil, vegetation and dung type. Maximum local diversity of dung beetles is observed after rainfall and decreases as surface conditions become warmer and drier. After workshop discussions, a coarse-grained, asymmetrical gradsect survey grid has been designed according to vegetative, climatic and land-usage gradients across South Africa. It is suggested that each survey point across these regional gradients should comprise a quarter-degree square in which local ecological gradients should be surveyed for invertebrates. Baited pitfall trapping is an easy method to provide quantitative data for dung beetles across such environmental gradients. Lining up each catch on a tray provides a relatively quick way to compare the specimens, identify the species present, and provide a quantitative assessment of species abundance. Data collection may be conducted on one or more occasions to accommodate seasonal and daily variation in species occurrence. This exercise could identify localities suitable for ecotourism reserves representative of the variation in ecotypes across the country, particularly in coastal, natural grass and wooded regions, where many invertebrate taxa are endangered by habitat fragmentation including some rare dung beetle species.",

(Diptera: Culicidae). The essential oil content of L. dentata leaves obtained by hydrodistillation was 1.18%dry weight. The chemical analysis performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that this essential oil contained eight compounds. The major chemical constituents identified were a-terpinolene (51.13 %) and camphor (13.43 %). Bioassay test done following the World Health Organization standard protocol revealed that this essential oil exhibited larvicidal activity. The LC50 and LC90 values against fourth instar larvae were 77.09 and 104.45 ppm for Cs. longiareolata and 113.38 and 150.38 ppm for Cx. pipiens, respectively. The results proved the potential use of this natural product as an alternative to synthetic insecticides for controlling mosquitoes.",

No treatment is currently directed towards the soil stages of FCM, with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) having the potential to fill the niche. Laboratory bioassays in orchard soil, using Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, showed the LD50 to be ≈3 and the LD90 to be ≈58 infective juveniles (IJs) per FCM larva. In a field trial, after application of three concentrations (20, 40 and 80 IJs/cm2) of H. bacteriophora, mortalities of >90 %were obtained for FCM larvae, with significant difference between the lower concentrations, but not with higher concentrations. Twenty-one days after application, there was no further FCMcontrol.With the field application of H. zealandica after 6 days, no significant differences were found in FCM mortality of >80 % between three nematode concentrations (5, 10 and 20 IJs/cm2). After 21 and 35 days no significantly different FCM mortality was found for all three treatments compared to the untreated trees. In a field trial using three nematode species, treatment with H. zealandica resulted in significant control for each evaluation day, up to day 49. Results from field trials showed local EPN species to have great potential for control of the soil stages of FCM, with the added possibility of good persistence.",

    "abstract": "The Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), is one of the most devastating tephritid fruit flies of horticulture worldwide. Field trials were carried out for two seasons on mango (Mangifera indica L.) to evaluate the use of male annihilation technique (MAT) using methyl eugenol laced with deltamethrin instead of the commonly used malathion for the suppression of the pest on mango in coastal Kenya. Prior to application of the MAT, mean total numbers of B. dorsalis flies per trap per day (FTD) in pre-suppression monitoring data were comparable in orchards assigned to MAT treatment (FTD = 3.5) and those assigned to the control (FTD = 3.5) in season 1 and 12.4 and 10.5 FTD, respectively, in season 2. Following the application of MAT systems, total FTD were significantly lower in MAT-treated orchards (0.1 and 2.7 FTD, for seasons 1 and 2, respectively) compared to that in the control (18.6 and 21.5 FTD, for seasons 1 and 2, respectively) at 49 days after deployment of the control measures. This represented a reduction in the B. dorsalis population of 99.5%in both seasons, resulting in a significant reduction of fruit infestation in the MAT-treated orchards compared to the control. The percentage of infested fruit was 25 and 18 times lower in MAT-treated orchards compared to the control for the first and second season, respectively. The number of puparia/kg ofmangofruit was 17 and 24 fold lower in MAT-treated orchards compared to the control for the two consecutive seasons. These findings demonstrate the suppression of B. dorsalis using the MAT, and subsequent reduction in fruit damage by the pest. It is therefore recommended that MAT be adopted within a holistic Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach in the mango agro-system, preferably covering large areas.",

    "abstract": "The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a worldwide maize pest originating from the American continent. It invaded Africa during 2016, causing important economic damages, forcing African countries to take urgent actions to tackle this new invasive pest. In Burkina Faso, several chemical insecticides were promoted, but farmers have quickly and repeatedly reported control failures. In this work, we collected seven fall armyworm populations in as many maize-producing areas of Burkina Faso. Following the approved IRAC leaf bioassay protocol, we evaluated the susceptibility of third instar larvae to seven commercially available insecticide formulations, including various modes of action: methomyl and chlorpyriphos-ethyl (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin (sodium channel modulators), emamectin benzoate and abamectin (chloride channel activators) and Bacillus thuringiensis (a microbial disruptor of insect midgut membranes). Lethal concentrations (LC50), resistance ratios (RR50) and relative toxicity were calculated for each population and active ingredient. LC50 values for all S. frugiperda populations were, in order of importance: emamectin benzoate (0.33–0.38 µg/l), methomyl (18–73 mg/l), abamectin (58–430 mg/l), chlorpyrifos-ethyl (199–377 mg/l), deltamethrin (70–541 mg/l) and lambda-cyhalothrin (268–895 mg/l). LC50 of the B. thuringiensis formulation ranged from 430 to 614 MIU/l. Lambda-cyhalothrin was the least efficient of the tested chemical pesticides, and emamectin benzoate the most efficient (relative toxicity ×2 712 969). Methomyl (×49), abamectin (×15), deltamethrin (×13), chlorpyriphos-ethyl (×4) were also more toxic than lambda-cyhalothrin. Based on these results, we conclude that emamectin benzoate, methomyl and chlorpyriphos-ethyl insecticides are the most efficient for the control of the fall armyworm in Burkina Faso. We discuss the importance to implement a national-level resistance survey for this major pest, which would allow rapid and efficient adaptation of the control strategy.",

Germination studies confirmed that figs pollinated by at least three of the agaonid species contained viable seeds. Some of the agaonids are known to be associated with other Ficus species, raising the possibility that gene flow maybe occurring between taxa in the Ficus natalensis species group.

It is shown that although temperature was hypothesized to most influence the distributions of these ectotherms, moisture, and particularly humidity, was in fact usually paramount. Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) and C. marginalis (Robineau-Desvoidy) had the most widespread geographic and climatic distribution, while the forest-associated C. inclinata (Walker) was the least widespread. Chrysomya putoria (Wiedemann) and C. megacephala (Fabricius) had very similar predicted distributions that were restricted mainly to Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the coast of the Eastern Cape. Chrysomya chloropyga (Wiedemann) and Calliphora croceipalpis (Jaennicke) were the only species predicted to occur at high altitudes. Blowfly distributions restricted to part of the map area were predicted better than those that were more widespread in the region, presumably because species with extremely wide-spread distributions in a study area occupy nearly the whole range of variation of most predictor variables, leaving little variation with which the maximum entropy modelling method can discriminate between presence and absence of the organism.",

    "abstract": "Within South Africa, millions of rands in revenue are generated annually from the export of fruit produce. Citrus fruits are exported mostly to the U.S.A., South Korea and China. These countries have strict biosecurity laws in place which prohibit the import of specific problem insects, including several species of mealybug (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). Although the adult females for most species of mealybug are routinely identified through morphological keys, eggs and nymphs (crawlers) are more problematic. As such, export consignments are regularly refused based on the presence of unidentifiable mealybug nymphs or eggs. The aim of this paper is to report an easy, user-friendly molecular laboratory technique to accurately identify mealybug eggs and crawlers to species level. We amplified and sequenced a 749 bp portion of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit one (COI) gene. Phylogenetic trees indicated that the five species included here (Planococcus citri (Risso), Paracoccus burnerae (Brain), Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni-Tozzetti), Ps. calceolariae (Maskell) and Ps. viburni (Signoret)) are reciprocally monophyletic and follow the 10× rule where sequence divergences separating species are an order of magnitude larger than divergences within species. As such, DNA can be extracted from eggs, crawlers or adults; analysed and compared with reference data, and unequivocally assigned to one of the five species.",

Two biological control agents, a shoot-galling fly, Procecidochares utilis Stone (Diptera: Tephritidae), and a leaf-spot fungus, Passalora ageratinae Crous & A.R.

    "abstract": "Malagasy dung beetles have evolved with a diverse group of primates (lemurs), the largest extant native herbivores on the island. The two main radiations include the endemic subtribe Helictopleurina (65 species) and the tribe Canthonini with several endemic genera (c. 170 species), both of which occur primarily in forests and feed on lemur faeces and carrion. Cattle were introduced to Madagascar about 1000 years ago, thereby establishing a completely new type of resource (cattle dung) for indigenous dung beetles. We report three striking patterns in the occurrence of dung beetles in cattle dung based on semi-quantitative sampling at nearly 80 localities across Madagascar. First, no dung beetles have shifted to use primarily cattle dung in wet forests, in contrast to other tropical regions, where ungulate dung is a key resource for dung beetles. Second, the community in open habitats includes 21 species (three Canthonini, six Helictopleurina, one Scarabaeini, four Onthophagini, six Aphodiini, and one Didactyliini), which is only a small fraction of the species number in comparable communities in mainland Africa. Third, nearly all species using cattle dung have maximally large geographic ranges across Madagascar, in marked contrast to relatively small ranges among forest-inhabiting species. This latter point applies also to four endemic Helictopleurina species, which have shifted to cattle dung in open areas and have subsequently expanded their ranges in comparison with their relatives inhabiting forests. The most numerous species in the community is the introduced Digitonthophagus gazella. We show that the abundance of D. gazella in local communities has no noticeable effect on the species composition in the remaining community.",

    "abstract": "On 5 May 2010, Bactrocera invadens Drew, Tsuruta & White was detected in a methyl eugenol-baited surveillance trap in the northernmost part of the Limpopo Province in South Africa, an area adjacent to the Zimbabwe border. A delimiting survey was carried out to determine extent of spread in the area by trapping with both methyl eugenol and Biolure-3-component lures. A quarantine area of approximately 1100 km2 (surrounding the area of detection) was implemented to regulate movement of host fruits. Eradication of the pest was achieved in the quarantine area through male annihilation technique (MAT) using fibreboard blocks containing methyl eugenol and malathion in combination with protein bait sprays (application of GF-120 and LokLure mixed with malathion) and orchard sanitation. Eradication measures were carried out for a period of 12 weeks. Thereafter, MAT blocks were removed and trapping continued for a period of four weeks to confirm eradication. No B. invadens was caught in the area during the four weeks after control measures had stopped. No B. invadens was captured within a period of 12 weeks (approximately three generations) after the last fly find in the area. This constitutes the first successful eradication of B. invadens from an area of incursion.",

    "abstract": "Pompom weed, Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.) DC. (Asteraceae), is a South American invasive plant that was first recorded in South Africa in the early 1960s. In the 1980s, C. macrocephalum started slowly extending its range and in the 1990s and 2000s it entered a dramatic expansion phase. It invades grasslands, savannas and wetlands where it has a significant impact on biological diversity. Control of C. macrocephalum has, so far, been based on herbicides, as mechanical approaches were found to exacerbate infestations through disturbance. However, due to the extent of the invasion, the financial and environmental costs of treating all C. macrocephalum infestations with herbicides would be prohibitive. As a result, a biological control programme was initiated against the weed in 2003. Surveys conducted on C. macrocephalum in its native range, indicated that northern Argentina has the highest diversity of natural enemies associated with the plant. Three insect species, Zeale (=Adesmus) nigromaculatus Klug (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), Liothrips tractabilis Mound & Pereyra (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and Cochylis campuloclinium Brown (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and one pathogen, Puccinia eupatorii Dietel (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae) were rated (based on damage, range and abundance) as having the most potential as biological control agents for C. macrocephalum. This paper is a review of the biology, host range and potential impacts of these agents, as well as the prospects for the control of C. macrocephalum in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Scale insects (Sternorrhyncha: Coccoidea) are one of the most invasive groups of insects. They are sedentary, cryptic, and often resemble the plant parts that they feed on. This coupled with increased international trade in fresh agricultural produce, makes them a major quarantine risk. An important limitation in controlling these pests involves species identification. When scale insects are intercepted on imported produce, they must be rapidly and accurately identified, using morphology-based keys. This is time-consuming and requires extensive taxonomic experience. In addition, intercepted specimens are often immature or damaged, making identification difficult or impossible. A reliable complementary tool is needed for identification. DNA barcoding may be of great value for this purpose. In this study we investigate the suitability of the nuclear regions 18S and 28S as complementary DNA barcodes to the mitochondrial CO1 gene, across 10 scale insect families. Combining multiple criteria, our results indicate that the concatenation of CO1 and 28S greatly improves the identification success rate of scale insects to 91.5 %, demonstrating the utility of DNA barcoding in pest management.",

However, its mechanism of action remains to be understood. Furthermore, the effects of the interaction of azadirachtin and 20E have not been investigated. The current study examined the effect of azadirachtin topically applied alone or in combination with 20E on Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, 1830 (Diptera: Drosophilidae). In initial bioassays, various doses (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5 and 4.5 µg) of azadirachtin was tested alone on newly ecdysed pupae and the inhibition doses (ID) of adult emergence determined. In a follow-up experiment, azadirachtin applied alone at its ID25 (0.59 µg) and ID50 (1.10 µg) was evaluated on catalase (CAT) and glutathion S-transferase (GST) activities, and yolk protein content in fat body and ovaries. Results showed that azadirachtin at the two tested doses increased significantly the activity of both GST at 48 and 72 hours, and CAT at 24, 48 and 72 hours following treatment. Moreover, azadirachtin treatment at these doses reduced significantly the yolk protein content in fat body and ovaries as compared to the control series. Finally, the exogenous 20E (0.25 and 0.50 µg), applied 24 or 48 h after azadirachtin treatment, relatively restored the normal values of CAT, GST and yolk protein content in fat body and ovaries. All these results indicate that exogenous 20E can compensate the depressive effects induced by azadirachtin on D. melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Commercial use of entomopathogenic nematodes against key insect pests of deciduous fruit, grapes and citrus in South Africa requires massive numbers of nematodes for inundative field application. High-technology in vitro liquid culture requires development to mass culture and to formulate these nematodes for commercial purposes. Heterorhabditis zealandica was identified as a species with potential as a biological control agent against a wide range of key insect pests. The first step towards the development of in vitro mass culture of H. zealandica was to establish monoxenic cultures of both the nematode and its Photorhabdus sp. symbiont, using in vitro liquid culture technology. The body length of various H. zealandica life stages during in vitro development was measured to determine the growth characteristics of H. zealandica in liquid culture. The growth curve of the symbiotic bacteria during the process time was measured to determine when the stationary phase was reached, as this would indicate the optimum time required for inoculating infective juveniles (IJs) and for aiding in maximum IJ recovery. On day 15, the IJs reached a maximum density of 41100/ml, while the hermaphrodites and females reached their highest density on day 16 at 9800/ml and 7700/ml, respectively, after which the experiment was terminated. Bioassays using Galleria mellonella were performed to compare the virulence between in vitro- and in vivo-produced nematodes, which indicated in vitro-produced nematodes to be significantly less virulent. This study illustrates that H. zealandica and its Photorhabdus sp. symbiont can be successfully cultured in liquid. However, two generations occurred during the process time, instead of the desirable one generation. Future research goals would include developing methods to increase the percentage recovery in the liquid culture, as doing so would increase the number of nematodes produced per ml and it would also reduce the processing time significantly.",

The seasonal activity pattern of this pest is characterized by two to three distinct generations during spring and summer followed by a diapause period of approximately six months during autumn and winter. Genetically modified Bt maize (MON810) that expresses an insecticidal Cry1Ab protein has been deployed in South Africa since 1998 to manage stem borers. The first report of field resistance of B. fusca to Bt maize was made during the 2006 cropping season. Resistant strains of this pest are expected have reduced fitness compared to susceptible individuals. Information regarding fitness of resistant individuals that survive on Bt maize could contribute to the understanding of resistance evolution as well as to development of improved resistance management strategies. Life history parameters of different B. fusca populations were compared in a laboratory study using diapause (spring) as well as second-generation (summer) populations. Sex ratio, pupal mass, fecundity and longevity of moths of field-collected Bt-resistant and susceptible B. fusca populations were compared. Slight adverse effects of Bt maize on fitness of the resistant summer-population were observed. The sex ratio was biased towards males in some resistant populations and towards females in susceptible populations. The resistant population had a lower mean pupal mass, shorter longevity of moths and reduced fecundity.",

All concentrations of S. yirgalemense, applied by immersion in a suspension of nematodes, gave >98 % control. The in vivo-produced S. yirgalemense resulted in codling moth control of >90 %, compared to 54 % and 31 % control by the H. bacteriophora Hb1 and Hb2 isolates, respectively. In follow-up field trials, S. feltiae resulted in ³80 % control, and was more effective than both the S. yirgalemense and the H. bacteriophora (Hb1) isolates. To validate the data obtained from the field trials, subsequent laboratory bioassays were conducted evaluating temperature regimes, following the same cycle as under natural conditions, with a constant humidity of 100 %. Steinernema feltiae proved to be most effective, causing >90 % mortality, followed by S. yirgalemense, with 78 % mortality. The two H. bacteriophora isolates (Hb1, Hb2) under the above-mentioned laboratory conditions, resulted in 73 % and 59 % control, respectively. Humidity, thus, seems to be the most important factor affecting EPN efficacy during above-ground applications.

    "abstract": "While there are currently several initiatives to identify priority areas for conservation, invertebrates, which may comprise as much as 95 % of biodiversity, are generally excluded from such activities. It is assumed that vegetation types and patterns of floral diversity will adequately reflect those of the underlying diversity, i.e. invertebrates. A lack of adequate data and expertise are the main contributing factors to the exclusion of invertebrates. Existing data for South African millipedes were evaluated in terms of usefulness for biodiversity conservation planning and management. We used databases from several museums and published records. Large gaps exist in the collecting coverage of South Africa, and many records date back to the early part of the last century. Quarter-degree grid cells containing the highest species richness, and the highest number of endemic species coincide with intensively collected areas and this approach thus has limited application for conservation planning. The number of site endemics (maximum distance between localities < 10 km) was 243, local endemics (11 km < maximum distance < 70 km) was 102, and regional endemics (71 km < maximum distance < 150 km) was 44, while the total number of South African endemics was 430 (89 % of 484 described species). While grid cells we identify as having the highest number of endemics may not be the only grids with high levels of endemism, as many as 20 endemic species are found within some quarter-degree cells. While patterns are partially explained by a collecting artefact, additional collecting will only increase the number of range-restricted species. The highest levels of narrow endemics occur in the smaller bodied, less mobile millipede families such as the Dalodesmidae, Gomphodesmidae and Odontopygidae, which have radiated in isolated habitats such as forests. Most parts of South Africa are inhabited by a large number of range-restricted endemics. Because of the large number of widely distributed site endemics, it would be impossible to conserve all species in formal state reserves. Millipedes may represent similar patterns of diversity to other soil and saproxylic animals, which all play critical roles in soil nutrient cycles. Although the data are incomplete, given the urgency created by rapid land-use change in South Africa, it is critical that taxon specialists evaluate their data and use these to identify important patterns and trends for improved biodiversity conservation efforts. In addition, efforts should be made to Red List invertebrates to highlight the extent of threats to the major component of biodiversity.",

Selection for resistance is based on field assessments and potted sugarcane screening trials of test cultivars. This paper describes the screening methodology and examines its efficacy for evaluating susceptibility to E. saccharina. Aims were to improve discrimination of borer susceptibility and to develop a quantitative, statistically meaningful method of rating cultivars. Test cultivars were planted in a replicated lattice design and artificially infested with E. saccharina. Four variables, namely length of stalk bored, number of internodes bored, numbers of surviving larvae+pupae, mass of larvae+pupae, that quantified borer damage and performance, were used to calculate a susceptibility/resistance rating for all cultivars on a 'one to nine' unit scale, where two units was equivalent to a 95 % confidence interval and the mid-point of the scale represented the control mean. Ratings were standardized and independent of those of other test cultivars within the same trial. Differences in susceptibility were significant in all trials and well discriminated in the majority. Improved discrimination produced a greater spread of cultivar ratings across the rating scale, facilitating the identification of resistant cultivars. The screening method and variables measured take into account the known resistant mechanisms to E. saccharina and provide a means of estimating the likely impact of cultivars on area-wide pest management in terms of larval survival and moth production.",

These species are facultative hyperparasitoids of a variety of hosts, and are being studied in connection with their association with cereal stem borers. Three native African species are currently recognized: T. atriclavus Waterston, T. sculpturatus Waterston, T. flaviclavus sp. n., as well as the introduced Asian species T. howardi (Olliff). Two new synonymies are proposed with T. atriclavus: Tetrastichus dispar Masi and Tetrastichus sesamiae Risbec. Tetrastichus mauripennis Waterston is transferred to the genus Aprostocetus (comb. n.). Tetrastichus sesamiae var. angolensis Risbec is elevated to specific status, although this species does not belong to the howardi species group. Lectotypes are designated for Tetrastichus atriclavus, T. sculpturatus, T. sesamiae, T. sesamiae var. angolensis and T. mauripennis.",

    "abstract": "The importation and release of biological control agents against invasive alien plants in South Africa are subject to regulation by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), under its Agricultural Pests Act, and by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), initially under its Environment Conservation Act, subsequently under the National Environmental Management Act and eventually, as soon as the relevant regulations have been developed, under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act. Peer review, both within South Africa, and with colleagues in other countries, has helped to ensure the integrity of the science and practice of weed biological control in South Africa. This paper traces the development of the regulatory system from the first weed biological control project in 1913, through a dispensation when importations and releases were authorized by DAFF only to a dual regulatory system involving two government departments. Inappropriate legislation, lack of knowledge about biological control amongst the relevant authorities and the costs of employing compulsory private consultants are some of the reasons for significant delays that have become a feature in the authorization of biological control agent releases. These delays have set back several control programmes. Holding agents in quarantine while awaiting decisions ties up expensive space and staff time and increases the risk of losing colonies through accidents or decreased genetic vigour. It seems likely that changes in legislation within DEA will streamline the regulatory process in the near future.",

    "abstract": "The Southern African Plant Invaders Atlas (SAPIA) is a mapping project, launched in 1994, to collate data on the distribution, abundance and habitat types of invasive alien plants in southern Africa. The SAPIA database is a computerized catalogue of some 70 000 locality records of more than 600 naturalized alien plant species. The database incorporates records gathered by about 560 participants, since 1994, and from roadside surveys by the author since 1979. Among its many uses, SAPIA can assist biological control programmes, in several ways. Information on the geographical distributions and ecological requirements of invasive plants in their introduced range can ensure that biological control agents are brought from comparable habitats in their country of origin so as to optimize their chances of establishment and efficacy. Early detection of new invaders and new foci of spread allows implementation of biological control at an early stage of invasion with the potential to pre-empt severe problems. In the longer term, SAPIA can provide an historical record of the distribution of invasive plants and could be used to monitor their rate of expansion or contraction before and after biological control. This review is a report on the development of and recent progress with the SAPIA project.",

Two species of stingless bees, Liotrigona mahafalya and L. madecassa, collected honeydew produced by mealybugs on an Albizia perrieri (Fabaceae) tree in the dry deciduous forest of Kirindy, Madagascar. Honeydew might represent an important part of the diet of Malagasy stingless bees, especially in times of scarce floral resources in the highly seasonal environment of western Madagascar. The interaction between the bees and two species of invasive ants, Monomorium destructor and Paratrechina longicornis, in competition for the honeydew resource, was studied. Numbers of stingless bees and ants on the honeydew source were negatively correlated, with ants decreasing in density distally from the main trunk of the tree and bees showing the opposite trend. Invasive ants could therefore potentially threaten the native bees by displacing them from this resource.",

Two Bt cotton varieties GK-12 and Lu-23, and two non-Bt varieties Zhong-12 and Simian-3 appeared more supportive for maintaining T. cinnabarinus, whereas, SGK-321 (Bt) and Shiyuan-321 (non-Bt) clearly showed reduced pest susceptibility, but efficient in maintaining N. cucumeris population. Throughout the study period, the densities of T. cinnabarinus remained higher (1.77 and 1.40 per leaf) in Bt than non-Bt varieties following insecticides application against the cotton pest complex. The beneficial mite N. cucumeris remained active in both Bt and non-Bt varieties, but Bt cotton had slightly higher numbers of the predator (0.58 per leaf) than non-Bt cotton (0.40 per leaf). Consequently, there were no great impacts on the predatory natural enemy associated with Bt cotton and the predator population in Bt fields was not negatively affected in comparison with conventional cotton. All tested varieties of cotton significantly differed in relation to their morphological characteristics. Of the different factors found to affect the populations of predacious and phytophagous mites, in general, the trichome density on the lower surface of the leaf, leaf thickness and plant height had positive relations with arthropod abundance. Our results showed that SGK-321 (Bt) and Shiyuan-321 (non-Bt) could be recommended for use in creating new resistant cotton varieties as a component of an integrated pest management strategy. Hence, the differences in the response of pest and predator to host plant and leaf architectures should be considered to enhance their roles in biological control strategy.",

Furthermore, GC-MS analysis was carried out to identify the chemical components of B. thuringiensis culture filtrate as well as A. cina and clove oil extracts. Nanosilica was the most effective treatment against T. absoluta followed by A. cina, imidacloprid A. cina, indoxacarb, filtrate of B. thuringiensis, imidacloprid, indoxacarb A. cina and clove oil treatments, respectively. The mixing of the tested insecticides with A. cina improved the efficiency against the tested insect relative to using insecticides alone.

With the exception of Chilo partellus, all other borer pests are indigenous to Africa and are assumed to have co-evolved with some native grasses and sedges. Understanding the interactions between pest species and their cultivated and native hosts are required to develop sustainable management strategies. In addition to pest species, natural habitats support diverse range of species (non-pests and their associated natural enemies) some of which are unknown to science. Although the stemborer—host plant interactions have been well described for eastern and southern Africa, knowledge regarding distribution and diversity of stem borer species and their host plants in western and Central Africa is limited. Existing knowledge of the stemborer species diversity of these regions indicate a lower specific and generic diversity compared to eastern and southern Africa. There is need to undertake extensive surveys in Central Africa, particularly in southwestern Cameroon, an area considered as principal centre of diversity and endemism in Africa. This paper provides results of the survey undertaken to establish stemborer species diversity and geographical distribution in Cameroon. A total of 32 stemborer species were identified from the 22 plant species found infested. This information is necessary for future studies on the biogeography and evolution of the noctuid stemborers.",

In this study, the effect of temperature on germination, growth and virulence of two isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae, ICIPE 18 and ICIPE 69, against first-instar larvae of Maruca vitrata at temperatures ranging from 15–35 °C, and mass-production potential of the isolates were assessed under laboratory conditions. Minimum, optimum and maximum threshold temperatures for efficacy of the best performing isolate, ICIPE 69, were estimated by the quadratic equation which emerged as the best model among the nonlinear mathematical expressions tested. Neither isolate germinated at 15 °C while germination was low at 35 °C for both. The optimum temperature for germination, radial growth and virulence of ICIPE 69 and ICIPE 18 ranged between 25–30 °C and 25–33 °C, respectively. Mortality of M. vitrata by both isolates ranged between 56.0 and 91.6�ross the different temperatures, with the highest mortality occurring at 25 and 30 °C for ICIPE 69 and ICIPE 18, respectively. The shortest LT50 values were 2.5 days for ICIPE 18 and 2.2 days for ICIPE 69 at 33 °C and 25 °C, respectively. The quadratic model predicted 25–30 °C as the optimum temperature range for maximum efficacy of M. anisopliae isolate ICIPE 69 against M. vitrata. Upper and lower threshold temperatures were predicted as 40 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Comparison of aerial conidia production on rice showed that ICIPE 69 yielded higher amounts of conidia (18.4 g conidia/kg rice) than ICIPE 18 (12.4 g conidia/kg rice).

In this review, subsequent progress and projects undertaken in the years 2011 to 2020, on both classical agents using exotic pathogens and inundative agents using indigenous pathogens, are detailed. We report on the impact of several previously introduced exotic fungi, monitored during this period. A significant highlight is the completion of 30 years of annual monitoring, from 1991 until 2020, of the impact of Uromycladium morrisii Doungsa-ard, McTaggart, Geering & RG Shivas (Raveneliaceae) on the density of Acacia saligna (Labill.) Wendel (Fabaceae), with declines of up to 98% recorded at monitored sites. Post-release monitoring also suggested that Entyloma ageratinae R.W. Barreto & H.C. Evans (Entylomataceae), introduced when Ageratina riparia (Regel) R.M.King & H.Rob (Asteraceae) still had a very limited invaded range in South Africa, has prevented the weed from realizing its potential as an invader. Uromycladium woodii Doungsa-ard, McTaggart, Geering & R.G. Shivas (Raveneliaceae) has been established on Paraserianthes lophantha (Willd.) I.C.Nielsen (Fabaceae), as has Puccinia xanthii Schwein (Pucciniaceae) on Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae). Prospodium transformans (Ellis & Everh.) Cummins (Raveneliaceae) failed to establish on Tecoma stans (L.) Juss ex Kunth var. stans (Bignoniaceae), while efforts to release Puccinia lantanae Farl. (Pucciniaceae) on Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) are underway. Of the established exotic pathogens that are classical biocontrol agents, two are considered to cause extensive damage, two considerable damage, and two moderate damage, to their target weeds. Puccinia arechavaletae Speg. (Pucciniaceae), an adventive fungus that is established on Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. (Sapindaceae) following an unknown path of introduction, is proving to be a damaging agent and the implications of its presence in the country are discussed. Early season augmentation of Puccinia eupatorii Dietel (Pucciniaceae) on Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.) DC. (Asteraceae) was tested to determine whether damage could be increased, but no difference in the rust's incidence and severity was evident between augmented and naturally infected plants at the end of the growth season. The identity of the indigenous fungus registered as Stumpout®, for the control of coppice growth after felling of Acacia mearnsii De Wild. (Fabaceae), was confirmed as Cylindrobasidium torrendii (Bres.) Hjortstam (Physalacriaceae) rather than C. laeve (Pers.: Fr.) Chamuris, as previously thought. The application of another indigenous fungus, Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (Glomerellaceae), by means of helicopter flights has facilitated its establishment on Hakea sericea Schrad. & J.C. Wendl (Proteaceae), in inaccessible mountainous terrain. For registration purposes, toxicity testing (oral rat LD50) of these indigenous fungi are required. Lethal doses of Cylindrobasidium torrendii, C. acutatum and Pseudolagarobasidium acaciicola Ginns (Phanerochaetaceae), the latter for use against Acacia cyclops G. Don. (Fabaceae), exceeded 2000 mg kg–1 body weight and all three fungi are thus considered safe for application.",

Developments in this regard have been ongoing, and have been reviewed, at approximately 10-year intervals, since 1991. This review spans the period 2011-2020, a timespan globally characterised by increased awareness of the impacts of invasive Prosopis populations, and recognition of the need for improved management. Concerted international collaboration has resulted in enhanced clarity on phylogenetic relationships within the Leguminosae and the phylogenetic placement of Prosopis. These advances have improved the framework for interpreting the host range of potential agents and for evaluating risk. At the outset of the biocontrol programme, in the 1980s, only agents that consumed mature seeds were considered. The intention was to reduce the invasiveness of Prosopis while simultaneously retaining it as a usable resource. The programme was subsequently expanded to investigate agents that prevent pod set or maturation of seed. More recently, potential agents that damage the vegetative growth of the plants have been included in response to recognition in South Africa, that there is no other route to successful management of Prosopis. There is a wealth of largely unexplored potential in this regard.",

    "abstract": "Although insects have a long tradition of use and appreciation in South Africa, insect conservation in the country dates back to 1976 with the first formal protection of a group of butterfly species. Today South Africa has a strong insect conservation research record, with significant contributions from both professional and amateur entomologists. This activity has in a number of instances led to insect conservation management actions. As in many other parts of the world, threats to arthropod diversity include rapid rates of land transformation in the form of, for example, overgrazing, soil erosion, urbanization, deforestation, the expansion of exotic plantations and invasive species. The impact of exotic and invasive flora is of particular concern in rare and restricted habitat types, such as high-altitude montane grassland. Initiatives aimed at promoting the cause, and improving the status, of insect conservation in South Africa include the identification of bioindicators, ecological landscaping, the conservation of insects in urban environments, as well as the mapping of species distributions to include insects in procedures for the identification of priority areas for conservation. Species that are extensively used as primary resources, such as mopane worms and wild silk moths, pose particular challenges to insect conservation in South Africa. In addition to long-term socioeconomic stability, the future of insect conservation in South Africa lies in national coordination of research and implementation initiatives, as well as continued financial support and the prioritization of conservation and research activities in the country.",

We compared selected leaf-litter invertebrate taxa (Hymenoptera, Opiliones and Amphipoda) between the two plantation types and indigenous forest using Winkler bag sifted leaf-litter extractions. Species richness was greatest in the indigenous forest (22 species) followed by the eucalypt (19 species) and pine (17 species) plantations. The Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE), which uses the number of rare species in the samples to estimate the potential maximum number of species, estimated 52 species in indigenous forest, 2.4 times richer than the 22 species estimated for pine and 1.8 times richer than the 29 species estimated for eucalypt. The Argentine ant Linepithema humile, (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was present in all three forest types and may have been one of the causes of the low invertebrate species richness. We recommend that levels of disturbance in the Newlands Forest area be reduced by consolidating the patches of indigenous forest and fynbos.",

    "abstract": "To determine the importance of different fire variables in promoting ant diversity in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, ants were studied in savanna grassland patches of different post-fire fuel age, and fire frequency. Pitfall traps were set in six grassland sites representing three fire regimes (1 : young (<24 months post-fire) and frequently burned; 2 : young and infrequently burned; 3 : old (4 and 6 years post-fire) and infrequently burned). Species richness declined with decreasing fire influence, being greatest on young and frequently burned plots, and lowest on old and infrequently burned plots. There was pronounced dominance by a few species on young and infrequently burned plots, and greater equitability at other sites. Ant diversity appears to be influenced more by post-fire fuel age than frequency of burning, although there is a need for a wider range of fire frequencies and greater replication to explore this further. Species richness was inversely correlated with the proportion of foliage biomass at ground level. Southern African ant communities may be quite resilient to differences in fire regime, and only a limited amount of fire diversity (young vs old patches) may be necessary to maintain ant diversity.",

    "abstract": "It is essential to assess the environmental risk that Bt maize may hold and to study its effect on species assemblages that fulfil a variety of ecosystem functions. Environmental risk assessment can be improved through the use of an ecological model which can be applied to a specific environment, so that local species can be classified functionally and prioritized to identify potential test species. Although the stem borers, Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), are the target species of Bt maize in South Africa various other Lepidoptera species are also directly exposed to Bt toxin. In this paper an ecological approach was followed for selection of non-target Lepidoptera species for ecological risk assessment of Bt maize, using data collected over a two-year period on Lepidoptera biodiversity on maize. Nine primary non-target lepidopterous consumers were identified. A selection matrix was developed in which each species was ranked for its maximum potential exposure to Bt toxin by assessing its occurrence, abundance, presence and linkage to other host plants in the maize ecosystem. Non-target Lepidoptera most likely to be affected were identified and prioritized for future testing and inclusion in risk assessments. Several non-target species were prioritized for their close association with maize, general occurrence in the maize-growing regions and their potential for economic damage should they become secondary pests. Through use of the selection matrix, knowledge gaps were identified for future research and guidance for the design of ecologically realistic experiments. Non-target species populations with the highest maximum potential exposure to Bt toxin are Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Acantholeucania loreyi (Duponchel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Eublemma gayneri (Rothschild) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) can be considered to be a 'value unknown' species in the wild. Because of their sporadic occurrence, Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are considered to be of lesser importance than H. armigera and A. loreyi, but should also be considered during pre-and post-release monitoring.",

Additionally, by comparing the taxonomic resolution reached in live versus fossil chironomid studies in this lake, we appraised the general information content of African fossil chironomid assemblages and, therefore, the quality of African chironomid-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. We found 141 chironomid specimens, representing two Tanypodinae, one Orthocladinae and 13 Chironominae (seven Chironomini and six Tanytarsini) taxa. All of these are conspecific to larval types encountered in subfossil collections from Lake Tanganyika or smaller East African lakes, but their differential diagnoses are updated here to include exoskeletal elements that are generally better preserved on live specimens. The chironomid assemblage collected in the Kigoma Bay depth samples is dominated by a few species of chironomine detritus and algae feeders, concentrated in areas of high macrophyte density. Additionally, there is a small component of tanypodine predatory taxa, along with several relatively rare, possibly habitat-specialist, taxa of both subfamilies. Our results further indicate that littoral and sublittoral palaeoenvironments in Lake Tanganyika may generally be inferred from high fossil density and diversity. The fairly high correspondence between inferred habitat preference of fossil and live collections in Lake Tanganyika indicates that, in large African lakes, the near-to-offshore gradient in chironomid habitat is imprinted on fossil assemblages. Hence, death assemblages deposited recently at various locations and microhabitats within Lake Tanganyika can be used as modern calibration data for palaeodepth inference. Moreover, Tanganyikan fossil-based taxonomy fully matches the taxonomic resolution reached in this study, so ecological information retrieved from live specimens can immediately be used for palaeoenvironmental studies.",

    "abstract": "Numerous thrips species cause economic damage to a range of agricultural crops in southern Africa. Much of this economic damage may be prevented by an accurate system for identifying pest thrips species. At present the inability to identify thrips species leads both to poor control in the field and a decrease in exports due to the presence of species of quarantine importance. The objective of this study was therefore to provide a thrips identification system for a selection of economically important species present in southern Africa. For this purpose, a molecular identification tool, based on nucleotide sequencing analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, was developed. Nine thrips species were included in analyses: Frankliniella occidentalis, F. schultzei, Fulmekiola serrata, Haplothrips nigricornis, H. clarisetis, Heliothrips sylvanus, Scirtothrips aurantii, Synaptorthrips psoraleae and Thrips tabaci. Analysis of 163 individuals showed that each of the nine thrips species could be distinguished on the basis of their COI sequences. Information generated was integrated with that produced previously for thrips species present in Europe and allowed a rapid, accurate and simple means of identifying the species of major economic importance present in southern Africa. The molecular key will provide much-needed information on thrips identification for South African pest management officers and quarantine purposes.",

The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was inadvertently introduced to many of these countries via contaminated seeds, but was deliberately introduced into South Africa for biological control. Following an isolated report of non-target feeding in the field in southeastern Asia, this study was aimed at re-evaluating aspects of the beetle's biology, in particular the likelihood of non-target attacks on native mimosoid Fabaceae that are closely related to L. leucocephala. A preliminary field assessment of the beetle's susceptibility to native parasitoids was also undertaken. The beetle's life cycle includes several attributes (e.g. rapid reproductive maturation, high rates of oviposition) that favour high population densities in the field. Although adults oviposited on the seeds of all test plant species during no-choice tests, oviposition was significantly higher on L. leucocephala. While several hatching larvae survived to adulthood on L. leucocephala, single adult individuals were reared from the seeds of each of three non-target species. Also, during multichoice tests, the beetles displayed strong oviposition preferences for L. leucocephala. Two hymenopteran parasitoid species were reared from seeds containing larvae which were exposed in the field, but overall levels of parasitism were low. These results confirm that the host range of A. macrophthalmus is largely restricted to the genus Leucaena, that native mimosoid Fabaceae are unlikely to be at risk and that the decision taken in 1999 to release the beetle was justified.",

A.H.Gentry (Bignoniaceae), cat's claw creeper, has become a significant threat to the biodiversity of a variety of sensitive ecosystems in South Africa. Owing to the nature of the infestations, as well as the difficulties and prohibitive costs associated with both mechanical and chemical controls, biological control is considered to be the most practical and sustainable means of successfully managing the weed in South Africa. The biological control programme against M. unguis-cati was initiated in 1996 and resulted in the release of Charidotis auroguttata Boheman (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Cassidinae). Despite repeated releases, initial rates of establishment were low. Where successfully established, populations of the beetle have been slow to build-up, leading to only limited impact on the weed. Prompted by this lack of success, as well as the high potential for further spread of the weed, additional natural enemies were sought. Two lace bugs, Carvalhotingis visenda Drake & Hambleton, and Carvalhotingis hollandi Drake (Hemiptera: Tingidae), a leaf-mining beetle Hylaeogena (Hedwigiella) jureceki Obenberger (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a leaf-tying moth Hypocosmia pyrochroma Jones (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and a seed-feeding weevil Apteromechus notatus (Hustache) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were subsequently imported into quarantine in South Africa for host-specificity testing. With the exception of A. notatus, all have been approved for release and are exhibiting promising initial rates of establishment and damage at a number of field localities. Impact studies have shown that cat's claw creeper is susceptible to sustained herbivore pressure.",

Three of the papers deal with issues related to research and implementation of biological control, namely: regulations and risk assessment; mapping; and cost:benefit analyses. The concluding paper is a complete catalogue, with summary statistics and key references, of all the target weeds and of the insect, mite and pathogen species (and subsidiary taxa) that have been implicated in biological control efforts against invasive alien plants in South Africa since 1913. This compilation is the third in a series of accounts of all the biological control programmes against invasive alien plants that have been undertaken in South Africa: the first, produced in 1991, reviewed progress to that date and the next, published in 1999, was a review of progress from 1990–1998. A comparison of the contents of these three review volumes is given in tabular form. The 2011 compilation contains reports on 13 novel programmes, in the sense that they have not been previously reviewed. Eight of these projects have focused on incipient weeds, or on rapidly-emerging weed species or groups of species, that have only recently been targeted for biological control. The increased scope and commitment to weed biological control research in South Africa has been largely the consequence of the sustained support provided by the Working for Water Programme of the South African Department of Water Affairs, over the last 15 years.",

Hakea sericea has become highly invasive and problematic in South Africa while H. gibbosa is less widespread and abundant but nevertheless problematic. Biological control against H. sericea started in 1970 with the release of two seed-attacking insects, a seed-feeding weevil, Erytenna consputa Pascoe (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and a seed-moth, Carposina autologa Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae). Both of these agents, together with an indigenous fungus, Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds f.sp. hakeae Lubbe, Denman, P.F. Cannon, J.Z. Groenew., Lampr. & Crous (Incertae sedis: Glomerellaceae), and manual clearing have reduced the abundance, and possibly the invasiveness, of H. sericea, but large infestations still persist in the coastal mountains of the Cape Floral Region in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. The release in 1979 of a weevil, Cydmaea binotata Lea (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), which bores in the terminal shoots and young needles of H. sericea has had a negligible effect. To enhance the levels of biological control, two new agents, a stem-boring beetle, Aphanasium australe (Boisduval) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), and a flowerbud feeder, Dicomada rufa Blackburn (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were released in 2001 and 2006, respectively. The focus in this review is on progress since 1999 with the biological control and management of H. sericea. Releases of E. consputa and A. australe on H. gibbosa have met with limited success, the reasons for which are also reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The biodiversity of Apis mellifera intermissa in the northern parts of Algeria is analysed using geometric morphometric investigations of workers' forewing variability. A total of 3400 worker bees was collected from hived colonies throughout the northern parts of Algeria, between 35°19′N–37°01′N and 00°54′W–8°06′E. Results showed a clear differentiation between the main three northern ecological regions. Differences involve mostly shape, while size contribution is generally weak. Within regions, shape variability between apiaries and colonies does not appear related either to the geographic location or to altitude. The large variability observed at the colony and apiary levels can possibly be related to anthropogenic introductions or exchanges, and it is concluded that both drift and polyandry are the most probable explanations. Finally, phenotypic differences between ecological regions probably result from restrictions to gene flow between their respective populations. Nevertheless, the relative contributions of local adaptations to environmental factors and to beekeeping remain to be established.",

Surveys conducted in their native range (Mexico) revealed that there were five potential biological control agents for T. rotundifolia, and three of these are currently undergoing host-specificity and performance evaluations in South Africa. Two leaf-feeding beetles, Zygogramma signatipennis (Stål) and Zygogramma piceicollis (Stål) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), are the most promising biological control agents for T. rotundifolia: preliminary host-specificity trials suggest that they are adequately host-specific. The stem-boring beetle, Lixus fimbriolatus Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is also highly damaging to T. rotundifolia, but its host range is yet to be determined. Two other stem-boring beetles, Canidia mexicana Thomson (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and Rhodobaenus auctus Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), have also been recorded on T. rotundifolia, and these will be considered for further testing if L. fimbriolatus is found to be unsuitable for release in South Africa. Only two insect species were imported as candidate agents on T. diversifolia, the leaf-feeding butterfly Chlosyne sp.

Only one pathogen, Puccinia enceliae Dietel & Holw.

The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was released in 1999 to curb its excessive seed production without negating its beneficial properties. The adult beetles oviposit on the seed pods and loose seeds of L. leucocephala and the hatching larvae enter the seeds and destroy them during their development. Although the beetle has become widely established in South Africa, its contribution to the weed's management is unknown. The aims of this pilot study were to assess: (i) the levels of seed damage inflicted by A. macrophthalmus on L. leucocephala populations and; (ii) the extent to which the endophagous immature stages have recruited native parasitoids. The study was carried out over seven months at three sites in the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region, where L. leucocephala is abundant. Mean seed damage was inconsistent, with considerable variation (2–62 %) between sites and time of collection. On average, <30 % of available seeds was damaged at each site. Five species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) were consistently reared from beetle-damaged seeds, two of which (both Pteromalidae) were most commonly associated with the beetles. Mean mortality resulting from parasitism was similarly inconsistent and variable (1–22 %) between sites and time of collection. Although parasitism increased with increased seed damage, on average only 7–9 % of larvae/pupae were parasitized at the three sites. The modest levels of seed damage recorded in this study appear insufficient to regulate populations of L. leucocephala in South Africa.",

In search of potential biological control agents, exploratory surveys were conducted in northern Argentina from 2005 to 2009. The surveys, which included plant species in the genus Cardiospermum and other native Sapindaceae, were aimed at determining the distribution and field host ranges of the natural enemies associated with C. grandiflorum. Eight phytophagous insect and two fungal pathogen species were associated with C. grandiflorum, four of which were introduced into quarantine in South Africa for further host-specificity testing. Based on the nature of the potential agents' damage, field distribution, abundance, field host range and the results of preliminary host-specificity tests, the seed-feeding weevil Cissoanthonomus tuberculipennis Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and the fruit-galling midge Contarinia sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) were deemed to be the most promising insect agents. Also promising was the rust fungus Puccinia arechavaletae Speg. (Fucciniales: Fucciniaceae) which caused severe disease symptoms on South African C. grandiflorum. However, feeding on two congeners of C. grandiflorum, whose exact country of origin is disputed, has limited the number of agents that are suitable for release. To resolve this problem, phylogenetic studies are currently under way to verify the contention that both non-target Cardiospermum species are native to South America and not to Africa. If that proves to be true, then these and other agents would qualify for release against C. grandiflorum in South Africa. Although this is a very recent programme, prospects for success seem good.",

Particularly for animals, this inter-generational ethnozoological knowledge was transmitted orally and has not been thoroughly documented and checked. Yet indigenous knowledge is crucial to assess sustainability of bio-resources and will inform reachable management goals. One such example from southern Africa is the much favoured edible stinkbug Encosternum delegorguei Spinola In this paper we review existing information on this beneficial insect and integrate observations on host plants, insect biology, seasonal distribution and socio-economics from South Africa and to a lesser degree Zimbabwe. Moreover, we show that research originating from Malawi, in the last 37 years, have misnamed the edible stinkbug as Nezara robusta Distant and that the correct identification is E. delegorguei. Other studies on edible insects have been done on lepidoptera, where the larval stage is harvested during the summer season. In contrast, E. delegorguei has incomplete metamorphosis and the adult is harvested during winter, a time of food scarcity, suggesting that further investigations are warranted on this culturally and economically important insect. Adaptive management and increased exploitation of E. delegorguei are potential development options to investigate.",

    "abstract": "Sustaining apiculture worldwide has been threatened by bee diseases and unexplained colony losses. African honeybee populations seem healthier and no major losses have been reported despite the presence of all the major pests and diseases. The scattered colonies in the large wild population of the continent might ensure slow pathogen spread and thus protect the unmanaged colonies in comparison with the concentration of colonies in managed apiaries. Beekeeping and trade in bee products is responsible for spreading many diseases throughout the world. The recent outbreak of the bacterial disease American foulbrood (AFB) in South Africa is a matter of great concern. Despite a growing number of apiaries testing positive for AFB, no major colony losses have been reported yet. This could be based on higher disease resistance of African honeybees, but such a trait might not persist if pathogens accumulate in the hives. In the first part of this article we review what is known on the history, biology and epidemiology of AFB as well as the control methods available. We then argue that given the particular context of honeybees in Africa, protection policies need to be put in place to ensure that African honeybees remain healthy.",

Numerous collection techniques for assessing arthropod diversity exist, but there is little understanding of the consequences of choice of any particular method. This information is essential for project planning and for the interpretation of results. Here we assess sweep netting and suction sampling, two widely used methods for sampling foliage arthropods, and compare them in terms of their efficacy and effort in surveying arthropod biodiversity. Arthropods were collected in paired transects in shrubby fynbos vegetation in the Cape Floristic Region, a biodiversity hotspot. Overall, the vacuum sampling collected significantly more species and individuals than sweep netting, although this was taxon specific. Use of the vacuum sampler significantly increased the time spent in the field per transect and it also collected significantly more dead plant biomass than the sweep net, thus requires a longer period to sort samples afterwards. Sweep netting caused significantly more damage to plants, an important consideration when working in sensitive ecosystems. Assemblage composition of arthropods collected by the two methods were significantly different with only about half of all arthropod species collected shared between the two methods. Our results show that overall, the vacuum sampler outperformed the sweep net in terms of arthropod species richness and abundance and minimising damage to vegetation, but that it takes considerably longer to collect the relevant data. When more representative biodiversity surveying is needed, the use of both techniques is encouraged.",

    "abstract": "Damage caused by the fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (syn. B. invadens Drew, Tsuruta & White) (Diptera: Tephritidae) on mangoes in Senegal leads to production losses. A potential biological control agent against this pest is the weaver ant Oecophylla longinoda Latreille (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Senegalese mango-based orchards present a diversity in design and management practices that can influence the abundance of these two species in orchards. In this study we evaluated i) the ability of the O. longinoda ant to limit B. dorsalis damage in Senegalese orchards, and ii) variations in population abundance for these two species depending on orchard design and management practices. The study was conducted in Senegal in the Niayes area and the Thiès plateau. Fifteen orchards were sampled among three out of four kinds of orchards identified in this area: (1) 'No-input mango diversified orchards', (3) 'Medium-input citrus-predominant orchards' and (4) 'Medium-input large mango- or citrus-predominant orchards'. In one of the orchards we measured infestation rates and numbers of fly pupae that developed from mangoes collected from trees (cv. Kent) 'with' and 'without' O. longinoda colonies over three harvesting periods (May, July and August) in 2013. The abundance of O. longinoda and B. dorsalis was measured for two months in the dry season and two others in the rainy season in the 15 orchards in 2012. The presence of O. longinoda on trees reduced the proportion of mangoes attacked by B. dorsalis as well as the number of pupae that developed from infested mangoes. The abundance of O. longinoda and B. dorsalis was negatively correlated. The abundance varied depending on the orchard design and management practices. O. longinoda abundance was greater in orchard types 1 and 3 than in type 4. Conversely, B. dorsalis abundance in the rainy season tended to be greater in orchard type 4 than in types 1 and 3. This study showed that O. longinoda is effective in limiting mango infestations by B. dorsalis. It also showed that the abundance of these two species was influenced by the orchard design and management practices. Therefore, using O. longinoda to control fruit flies is possible in Senegalese mango-based orchards by promoting weaver ant preservation.",

The pest wiped out tomato plantations, causing 100 % crop loss for some producers. This was despite the use of a variety of insecticides locally available to manage other vegetable insect pests. In this study, 10 insecticides from different insecticide classes including pyrethroids, organophosphates, spinosyns, insect growth regulators and diamides were screened for their efficacy against T. absoluta using a randomized complete block design with two different planting dates in 2013. The mean fruit infestation in the untreated control plot ranged between 54 and 76 %. In plots treated with diamide insecticides (chlorantraniliprole) fruit infestation was significantly lower with 2–6 % fruit damage followed by spinosyns (spinetoram and spinosad) with 30–35 % damage. A similar trend was observed in leaf damage severity. Mean marketable and total yield from the best performing treatment, Ampligo (a mixture of a diamide and a pyrethroid), were 18.4 and 31.9 t/ha, respectively. The corresponding marketable and total yields from the untreated plot were 3.2 and 13.5 t/ha. This corresponds to yield losses of 82.6 and 57.7 % in marketable and total yield, respectively. T. absoluta has the potential to develop pesticide resistance very quickly due to short generation time and high reproductive potential. Insecticides found effective need to be used judiciously including the rotation of effective insecticides from different classes. Future research on the management of this pest should focus on developing a biocontrol based integrated pest management system.",

However, their potential as candidate agentsmaybe influenced by the extent of their association with the plant throughout the year. Populations of S. madagascariensis around Pietermaritzburg were sampled four times over one year (i.e. across seasons) to determine the presence and abundance of the major herbivore taxa relative to the plant's phenology. Similar amounts of foliar and floral material were available to the various insect herbivore guilds throughout the year. The sampled plant populations supported 84 % of the insect herbivore taxa known to be associated with S. madagascariensis in KwaZulu-Natal. Nine of the 10 taxa that were deemed promising as candidate agents were recovered and included three capitulum feeders, four stem borers and two foliage feeders. Of these nine taxa, four were recovered during all four sampling occasions, while two were recovered on three occasions, two on two occasions and one on one occasion only. There were significant differences across seasons in the abundance of these candidate agents. The release of combinations of agents, that attack the same or different tissues, may be required to compensate for differences in abundance and ensure that herbivore pressure is sustained throughout the year.",

A limited number of insecticides, as well as biological control and mating disruption can be applied as control measures in citrus, but they often do not reduce pre- and post-harvest crop loss adequately. The potential of the sterile insect technique (SIT) for the control of T. leucotreta was investigated between 2002 and 2006 in Citrusdal, Western Cape Province, South Africa, and entailed studies on radiation biology and F1 sterility, compatibility with the egg parasitoid Trichogrammatoidea Nagaraja (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), and field cage experiments to determine sterile:fertile moth overflooding ratios. Promising results justified a pilot experiment conducted on semi-commercial scale in citrus orchards in Citrusdal during 2005–06. One thousand mixed sex moths were treated with 150 Gy ionising radiation and released in 35 ha of Washington navel oranges twice a week for 28 weeks during the production season. The moths were released by hand from an all-terrain vehicle, with release rows 40mapart and the numbers of released and feral moths monitored weekly with pheromone traps. Released moths dispersed well and fully overlapped between release rows. The target overflooding ratio of released to feral males (10:1) was exceeded by wide margins and ameanoverflooding ratio of 41:1 was maintained during the experiment. Fruit drop assessments were conducted once a week in the SIT-treated and control orchards. Crop loss due to T. leucotreta infestation was reduced by 95.2 % in the SIT-treated area compared to the control orchard.

These mass-rearing activities have created employment for 41 fulltime, fixed contract staff, of which 11 are people living with physical disabilities. To improve the uptake of mass-rearing through community engagement, appropriate protocols are required to ensure that agents are produced in high numbers to suppress invasive alien plant populations in South Africa.",

After adjusting for the prior selection of Hymenoptera, the ordinal composition of the arthropods was calculated. The major components, based on number of specimens, are : Coleoptera (29 %), Homoptera (18 %), Blattodea (17 %), Diptera (13 %), Thysanoptera (7 %), and Hymenoptera and Orthoptera (6 % each). The major components of the 108 specimens (at least 68 species) of Hymenoptera are approximately: Chalcidoidea (20 %), Formicidae and Sphecidae s.l.

Thirteen hosts were identified for S. calamistis, ten for E. saccharina and two for B. fusca. The non-gramineous hosts were the two sedge species, Cyperus papyrus and Rhynchospora corymbosa (Linn.)

For the development of sampling plans, dispersion was described for all species using Taylor's power law and a non-linear model which gives the relationship between the proportion of infested plants [P(I)] and the mean density (m). The majority of host-plant species yielded an aggregated distribution of stem borers, corroborating results of various authors. Mean dispersion was similar among insect species, thus common optimal sample size / mean density curves were developed for all borer species. Enumerative sampling procedures are proposed as binomial sampling plans were shown to be less efficient.",

Cordon infestation preceded bunch infestation by three to five months, the latter occurring from about January or February.

Damage to the berries occurred about four weeks after thrips were recorded on the sticky traps. Phlyctinus callosus Boh. was recorded under fluted cardboard bands tied around the stems of vines from early October, with the first bunch damage recorded towards the end of October. More Epichoristodes acerbella (Walker) moths were caught in pheromone traps during the cool winter months than during the hotter summer months. Damage to the bunches started during November and declined during January and February, only to increase again towards the end of February and March. Although Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) moths were caught in pheromone traps, no damage ascribed to this insect was recorded. The only phytophagous mite was Tetranychus urticae Koch, which was active throughout the fruiting season. The most common predatory mite was Euseius addoensis (Van der Merwe & Reyke).",

The composition of Coleoptera assemblages, attracted by cow dung, differed significantly between invaded and uninvaded grassland habitats. Coleoptera richness and especially abundance values were found to be significantly lower in the invaded stands compared to grassland. Mean body size showed significant differences when compared between the two habitat treatments. The invaded sites exhibited a marked decline in the larger and less abundant species. Also, parataxonomic units unique to the grassland were, in general, characterized by larger body sizes compared to those unique to the invaded sites.

The present study was carried out in cassava fields in Awae II and Mengomo, southern Cameroon, during the short wet and dry seasons of 2006. Foraging activity of A. tenella was continuous during the circadian cycle and showed four peaks of activity; two during the day and two at night at both localities and in both seasons. Activity was greater at night than during the day, and greater in the wet than in the dry season. During the day, activity was significantly positively correlated with relative humidity, and negatively correlated with air temperature. During the night, it was positively correlated with relative humidity but not with air temperature at both localities. The diet of A. tenella consisted of solid items, mainly live prey (63.3 %) but also dead prey (36.7 %) and sugary secretions collected from various hemipterans. Stictococcus vayssierei was the most commonly tended hemipteran (98.5 %). Continuous foraging activity, omnivory and especially association with hemipterans are factors that favour the numerical dominance of A. tenella in cassava fields.",

Seven species of parasitoids (all Braconidae) were recorded and reared from six fruit species.

Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) (77%) was the host fly most commonly reared from fruits yielding parasitoids including F. caudatus. Annona senegalensis Pers. was the fruit species most frequently infested by fruit flies and Saba comorensis (Boj. ex DC) Pichon fruits had the highest parasitism rates.

Although deemed to be an ‘emerging weed’, Tecoma stans has considerable potential to extend its range because it is still common in South African gardens and its seeds are easily dispersed by wind. Mechanical and chemical control methods are not economically feasible as the plant tends to re-grow, thus requiring expensive follow-up treatments.

Not only can this result in reduced crop yield, but more importantly because of the moth's endemism to sub-Saharan Africa, it is classified as a phytosanitary pest by many export markets. An entire consignment of citrus may be rejected in the presence of a single moth (Moore 2012). Since the bulk of citrus fruit production in South Africa is exported, the control of T. leucotreta is critical (Citrus Growers Association, South Africa 2012). Traditionally, control has been achieved through the use of chemical insecticides; however, residue restrictions, resistance development and concerns about environmental pollution have substantially reduced the dependence on chemical pesticides in citrus. Research on T. leucotreta control has therefore focused on the use of biological organisms (e.g. parasitoids and viruses), which are used as control agents within an integrated pest management (IPM) programme in citrus. These biological control agents, however, only targeted the aboveground life stages of the pest, not the soil-dwelling life stages (late fifth instars, prepupae, pupae), which is the subject of this contribution (Moore 2012).",

In the context of ongoing intensive destruction of tropical rainforest by agricultural activities, there is a wealth of information on the influence of agricultural practices on arthropod diversity on southern Cameroon cocoa farms. The present study examined the diversity and the composition of ant communities on traditional cocoa farms in relation to agricultural practices along a south—north latitudinal gradient in the Centre Region of Cameroon. Ants were sampled in 21 plots using the chemical knock-down technique, along a latitudinal gradient from Ngomedzap (forest) in the south through Obala (forest-savanna) to Bokito (savanna) in the north. Species richness, Shannon diversity index and Bray-Curtis distance were used to characterize diversity of ant communities and their dissimilarity between habitats. A total of 66 ant species, belonging to 24 genera and seven subfamilies were identified from a sample of 114 843 workers. The ant diversity of Obala is higher than that of Ngomedzap and Bokito. Estimation of Bray-Curtis distances demonstrated that the ant communities of Ngomedzap and Obala were similar to each other, but very different from that of Bokito. The ant communities of Centre Cameroonian cocoa farms appeared relatively diversified. These communities varied in species composition and diversity in relation to agricultural practices along south—north latitudinal gradients.",

    "abstract": "Cabbage, Brassica oleraceae L., and French beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L., are important vegetables grown in Ghana. However, attack by insect pests affects their quality and marketable yield. On-farm experiment was undertaken during the major rainy season of 2012 at Afari and Kpong, in the moist Semi Deciduous Forest and Coastal Savanna agro-ecological zones of Ghana, respectively, to explore the use of homemade extracts from fruit of hot pepper, Capsicum frutescens L. in the management of insect pests of cabbage and French beans. The treatments included a crude water extract from pepper fruit (20 g/l w/v), the semi-synthetic insecticide emamectin benzoate, ATTACK® (1 ml/l v/v) and tap water as a control. The dominant pests found on cabbage at both locations were the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). On French beans, the flower thrips, Megalurothrips sjostedti (Trybom), the whitefly, B. tabaci and a range of leafhoppers, Empoasca spp. were found at both locations. The cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora (Koch) was present only at Kpong. Among the natural enemies found on cabbage at both locations were the larval parasitoid, Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov), the ladybird beetles, Cheilomenes spp., hoverflies and a number of spiders. On French beans, ladybirds and spiders were observed only at Kpong. Generally, the application of pepper and emamectin benzoate were effective in controlling some pests of cabbage and French beans and also conserved the natural enemies. Emamectin benzoate and pepper treated-plots had higher yields of French beans than the control plots at Afari. The potential of homemade pepper spray for pest management on smallholder farms, backyard gardens and in organic vegetable production systems is discussed.",

The success of IAS (animal species in particular) in novel regions is often attributed to the absence of natural enemies and a subsequent decrease in population regulation (Liebert et al. 2006), a phenomenon referred to as the enemy release hypothesis (Jeffries & Lawton 1984). As a result, biological control initiatives are largely geared to reconnect IAS with their natural predators and parasites (Irvin & Hoddle 2010). Unfortunately this necessitates the release of yet another alien organism (Veldtman et al. 2011).",

In temperate zones, insect populations take a substantially longer time to reach the adult stage in the northern compared to the southern regions. In this study, emergence pattern and larval growth of the threatened zygopteran (Odonata) Coenagrion mercuriale were investigated in a population located in the southern limit of its distribution range in order to determine its life history strategies in a hot climate and compare them to those displayed in northern populations. There was no apparent winter diapause. The species produced two generations in a year, with the first generation emerging in mid spring and the second in late summer. The emergence pattern of the first generation was typical of a summer species and lasted 48 days. All larvae emerged by the end of May. Due to some environmental perturbations, the emergence pattern of the second generation was not surveyed, but there was evidence that the emergence season was short (21 days). Larval structure prior to the second emergence of the year showed that only 25%of the population was in the final instar, which explains the shorter emergence season.We assume that the first eggs laid in the spring hatch and grow rapidly to reach the final instar in late summer as a consequence of higher temperatures and potential high food availability. There was a significant seasonal decline in body size in both males and females. The second generation had a significantly smaller body size, presumably due to the short growth season and/or higher growth rate.",

Despite recent advances in the efficiencies of pheromone lures and traps, low or moderate control has often been reported by researchers and growers. In 2012 the first known case of parthenogenesis in T. absoluta was reported in a French population of the pest. Although such reproduction mode was not proven to occur in nature, this discovery raised many concerns about the future of pheromones for the control of this moth, since their use is absolutely dependent on the assumption that the pest can only reproduce sexually. In this paper, we report the ability of three Tunisian populations of T. absoluta to reproduce asexually under laboratory conditions by assessing age-specific and total female fecundity, egg viability and adult longevity. Also, we discuss the possible implications for IPM programmes targeting this pest.",

In total, 15 species (one with two subspecies) are reported from the country. However, the occurrence of Cicindela maroccana maroccana is questionable, and should be confirmed by newer data. Checklists of tiger beetles are also provided for each Tunisian governorate. The highest diversity was recorded in the region adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea coastline. The area is mainly up to 100 m a.s.l. with salt marshes, strands of sandy sea beaches and river banks as main types of habitats occupied by Cicindelinae (14 species or 94 % of tiger beetle fauna). Mountainous and desert regions are characterized by much lower diversity (six species or 38% of fauna and two species or 13% of fauna, respectively). Cicindelinae occurring in these areas inhabit predominantly river banks and oases. In chorotype classification, Tunisian tiger beetles fall into six different groups including West Mediterranean species (50% of fauna), Maghreb endemics (19%), Mediterranean, North-African, Mediterranean-Westturanian and Afrotropico-Indo-Mediterranean species (each of them 6% of fauna). According to their phenology, the Tunisian tiger beetles may be divided into three main groups: 1) spring-active species (Cicindela campestris atlantis and all Neolaphyra taxa), 2) spring-summer-active species (Calomera littoralis littoralis, C. lunulata lunulata, Cassolaia maura cupreothoracica, Lophyra flexuosa flexuosa, Myriochila melancholica melancholica, Grammognatha euphratica euphratica), and 3) summer-active species (Calomera aulica aulica, Cylindera trisignata sciliensis and Cephalota spp.).",

Host plant quality affects the development, survival and fecundity of T. urticae. The life table parameters of T. urticae on three country bean varieties (Lablab purpureus L.), namely IPSA Seam 1, BARI Seam 1 and Kartica, were maintained at 25 ± 2 °C, 65 ± 5 % relative humidity (RH) and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) in a growth chamber. The mean immature development time of T. urticae from egg to adult was significantly longer on IPSA Seam 1 than on the other two varieties. There were significant variations in fecundity and longevity which resulted in large differences on population growth parameters like the intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), net reproductive rate (Ro), finite rate of increase (λ) and doubling time (tD). Kartica and BARI Seam 1 were the most suitable host for T. urticae with rm = 0.230 and 0.223 (offspring/female/day), respectively. The slowest population growth was observed on IPSA Seam 1 with rm = 0.197. The findings of the current study indicated that IPSA Seam 1 is a less suitable variety to two-spotted spider mite compared to the other two varieties. Furthermore, these results may lead to finding and screening process of comparatively resistant country bean varieties to be used in the management of T. urticae.",

This study aims at evaluating the nutritional and heavy metal levels in workers, soldiers and primary reproductives of Macrotermes bellicosus (Smeathman) collected from farmland, a dump site and an industrial estate in Abeokuta, southwestern Nigeria. Proximate analysis was done using standard methods, vitamins were analysed spectrophotometrically while minerals and heavy metal analyses were done using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The soldiers and worker termites recorded higher values of ash, crude fibre, crude protein and carbohydrate contents than reproductive termites (queen and king). The reproductives recorded higher fat content than workers and soldiers. The highest ash (2.27 ± 0.02 %), crude fibre (1.04 ± 0.02 %), crude protein (20.96 ± 0.01 %) and carbohydrate contents (3.65 ±0.01 %) were recorded for workers and soldiers collected from the industrial estate. The reproductives from farmland recorded the highest average vitamin contents, 16.96 ± 0.01 mg/g of vitamin A, 2.74 ± 0.01 mg/g of vitamin B and 7.15 ± 0.02 mg/100 g of vitamin C. The lowest vitamin A and B contents recorded for soldiers from the dump site were 15.12 ± 0.01 mg/g and 2.09 ± 0.01 mg/g, respectively, while soldiers from the industrial estate had the lowest (4.51 ± 0.01 mg/100 g) vitamin C content. Castes from the industrial estate had the highest amount of Cu2 (0.076 ± 0.001 mg/1) while the highest values of Cr2 0.226 ± 0.001 mg/1 and 0.223 ± 0.003 mg/1 were recorded for workers from farmland and the dump site, respectively. Lead Pb2 was only detected in the soldier castes. From the results, it can be concluded that termites are rich in crude protein and have a very low tendency to accumulate heavy metals from the soil.",

A potential problem associated with constant application of viral biopesticides is the differing susceptibility to the virus observed between different geographic populations of the insect host. This could be related to a number of factors, including biological performance and fitness of the target insect population. This study compared a variety of phenotypic traits between geographically distinct T. leucotreta populations collected from the Addo, Marble Hall, Citrusdal and Nelspruit regions of South Africa, and reared under laboratory conditions for several generations. Traits including pupal mass, female fecundity, egg hatch, pupal survival, adult eclosion and developmental time were used as parameters to measure biological performance and fitness. Insects from the Citrusdal region of the Western Cape exhibited significantly lower pupal mass, female fecundity, egg hatch, pupal survival, adult eclosion and the longest duration in larval and pupal development compared to the other colonies investigated. This is the first study to report differences in the performance of laboratory reared T. leucotreta from different geographic locations, and the findings may have important implications for the application of viral biopesticides for the control of this pest in South Africa.",

Results showed the beetle larvae to be highly susceptible to a concentration of 80 IJ/insect of H. zealandica and S. yirgalemense, obtaining 80 % and 92 % mortality, respectively. Adult beetles were found to be twice as susceptible to S. yirgalemense with 64 % mortality, as to H. zealandica with 30 % mortality recorded. Tolerance of both species of infective juveniles to aqueous solutions of Cyperfos 500 EC®, Cryptogran™, Helicovir™, Nu-Film-P® and Zeba®, for infectivity and survival was evaluated. Heterorhabditis zealandica proved to be highly compatible to all products tested, with no significant increase in nematode mortality. The formulations also did not affect the ability of H. zealandica to infect Tenebrio molitor, after exposure to products over a 24-h period. Significant increase in mortality of S. yirgalemense was recorded after 12 hours of exposure to Nu-Film-P® and Cyperfos 500 EC®, and after 6 hours of exposure to Nu-Film-P®. However, results for S. yirgalemense infectivity showed no decrease in the ability of the nematodes to infect insect hosts. Results indicated that nematodes should possibly be applied before the release of C. montrouzieri in citrus orchards.",

There are two strains reported, viz. rice strain and maize strain. Though several diets were tried in different parts of the world, none of them contained rice leaf powder as a component from natural host. Hence a study was conducted to evaluate the biology, nutritional indices, age-stage and two-sex life table to assess the suitability of the different artificial diets for S. frugiperda larval development. Six differently modified artificial diets were tested to evaluate the following biological parameters: duration of larva and pupae, survival of larvae and pupae, pupal weight, sex ratio, fecundity, adult pre-oviposition period, total pre-oviposition period, adult longevity and total lifespan. The following nutritional indices were determined: growth rate, relative growth rate, consumption rate, consumption index, approximate digestibility, efficiency of conversion of ingested food, efficiency of conversion of digested food and metabolic cost. Larval development showed a significant difference among the diets, in relation to the life table parameters. The results indicated that optimal growth, development and food utilisation by S. frugiperda occurred in the mixture of rice leaf powder and chickpea flour-based diet followed by the mixture of maize leaf powder and common bean powder-based diet. Evaluated diets also had a significant effect on the net reproductive rate, gross reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, mean generation time and population doubling time. The values of these parameters were higher in the mixture of rice leaf powder and chickpea flour-based diet followed by mixture of maize leaf powder and common bean powder-based diet.

    "abstract": "Banana-weevil populations and associated damage were studied in adjacent plantations of highland cooking-bananas (cultivar Kibuzi) and introduced beer-bananas (cv. Kisubi) on a farm in central Uganda. Weevil density and mobility were assessed using mark and rerapture techniques. Residual banana corms and pseudostems were evaluated for weevil damage at various intervals following harvest. Newly harvested cooking-bananas revealed moderate weevil damage that reached the corm centre, whereas damage to beer-bananas was light and restricted to the corm periphery. Weevils attacking beer-bananas preferred post-harvest residues to growing plants and post-harvest stems were far more susceptible to attack than post-harvest corms. Despite the resistance of Kisubi plants, weevil captures and population densities were always higher than those in the Kibuzi plantation. There was no obvious migration of weevils between the two plantations. High weevil populations in beer-banana plantations appear to originate from post-harvest residues and have been maintained by a combination of factors, particularly soil moisture. Yield loss in beer-bananas was probably limited since attack was largely confined to post-harvest residues.",

Anopheles gambiae s.l. Giles was most prevalent in both study areas, followed by An. funestus Giles in Dodowa and An. pharoensis Theobald in Prampram. Anopheles gambiae s.s. occurred in sympatry with An. melas Theobald in Prampram. Small numbers of An. nili Theobald, An. hancocki Edwards, An. coustani Laveran, An. moucheti Evans and An. hargreavesi Evans were collected in Dodowa and their role in transmission was negligible. Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus were found to be the major human-biting species in Dodowa, while An. gambiae s.l. and An. pharoensis were the most common biting mosquitoes in Prampram. The overall biting rate of the anophelines at Dodowa was twice that at Prampram. Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus were identified as the main vectors of malaria by salivary gland dissections. Overall mean infectivity rate of both species was approximately 2.5 times higher at Dodowa than at Prampram. Anopheles pharoensis was not found to be infected with Plasmodium parasites. The intensity of malaria transmission at Dodowa, the coastal forest area, was about six times higher than Prampram, the coastal savanna area. Some aspects of control strategies are discussed.",

Durban, South Africa, is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and the demand for land is increasing. The Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (D'MOSS) was created for both ecological and social enhancement through an integrated approach to urban open space establishment and management. We assessed a subsection of the D'MOSS for its contribution to biodiversity enhancement. Invertebrates were selected as indicators of diversity. Pitfall trapping was conducted on a seasonal basis on traffic islands from two landscaping management regimes : extensive mown areas (i.e. limited structural diversity) and the inclusion of indigenous and exotic shrubs, herbs and trees (i.e. structurally enhanced). The influence of adjacent remnant natural areas as a source for these islands was also assessed. Species-area and species-distance predictions based on island biogeography theory were tested to determine whether they apply at this small scale. In this study, urban traffic islands accommodated 232 invertebrate morphospecies, i.e. 71% of the estimated species richness for a larger sampling effort. A total of 23 881 individuals were sampled, 81% of which were a single species of ant and a collembolan. Species abundance followed expected seasonality (high in summer and low in winter) irrespective of island treatment. While enhanced islands supported a higher richness during spring, as well as a greater number of unique species overall, our results were not conclusive in their support of either the movement of invertebrates along corridors of semi-natural vegetation, or the value of larger areas of urban open space. The lack of independence between distance and area in this study, the limited scale over which diversity was measured, and the influence of multiple sources of emigration are discussed.",

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), populations was studied for two years (February 2000 - January 2002) on unsprayed cabbage plots near Brits, North West Province, South Africa. Cabbage seedlings were transplanted three consecutive times each year. Infestations by P. xylostella, and the incidence of its parasitoids, were monitored at weekly intervals throughout the study period. The flight activity of P. xylostella male moths was also monitored at weekly intervals using synthetic sex-pheromone traps. Trap catches indicated that moths were active throughout the year and their flight activity corresponded with larval infestations on the crop. Trap catches and infestation levels were low in summer, autumn and winter (December-August) and high in spring (September-November). Eight indigenous parasitic Hymenoptera were reared from P. xylostella : the larval parasitoids Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) (Braconidae) and Apanteles halfordi (Ullyett) (Braconidae), the larval-pupal parasitoids Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Eulophidae) and Diadegma mollipla (Holmgren) (Ichneumonidae), the pupal parasitoid Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Ichneumonidae), and the hyperparasitoids Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), Mesochorus sp. (Ichneumonidae), and Pteromalus sp. (Pteromalidae). Parasitism rates of P. xylostella larvae were high reaching 100 % on several occasions during late spring, summer and autumn (November-May) each year. Parasitism was lower (<50 %) in winter and early spring (June-September). Cotesia plutellae was the most abundant parasitoid of P. xylostella followed by O. sokolowskii. Both parasitoids were active throughout the year. Apanteles halfordi was absent only in winter. Only one specimen of D. mollipla was recorded, in spring, during this study. A high rate of parasitism of P. xylostella pupae by D. collaris was observed only in spring (September-October). Hyperparasitism rates were high in spring and summer (September-February) when up to 35 % of collected P. xylostella larvae and C. plutellae cocoons yielded hyperparasitoids. The roles of biotic and abiotic mortality factors on the population dynamics of P. xylostella are discussed.",

To confirm that C. cactorum is a threat to a wide range of Opuntia species in North America, the host range of the moths was scrutinized in South Africa, where larval development could be monitored on several Opuntia species under natural conditions. Development was monitored on Opuntia ficus-indica L. Miller, O. engelmannii Salm-Dyke, O. fulgida Englm, O. imbricata (Haworth) de Candolle, O. stricta Haworth and O. leucotrichta DC. Larval survival, egg to pupation, was highest on O. ficus-indica (79.2 %) followed by O. engelmannii (57.5 %), O. stricta (55.0 %), O. leucotrichta (29.2 %), O. fulgida (24.2 %) and O. imbricata (16.7 %). Male and female pupal mass was highest, and duration of development shortest on O. ficus-indica. In adult multi-choice oviposition trials, females laid significantly more egg sticks on O. ficusindica than on the other species. Although O. ficus-indica is the preferred host for C. cactorum in South Africa, the moth is nevertheless able to utilize several other species of Opuntia as hosts.",

The woodwasp, S. noctilio, damages trees by releasing toxic mucus into the wood during oviposition. A 50 × 50 m grid was generated over the study area and 65 cells were randomly selected. Within each cell, a 10 m circular plot was created and the level (%) of S. noctilio infestation was visually assessed. Using high spatial resolution imagery (0.5 m), 13 texture measures were calculated with various window sizes. Correlation tests were then performed to determine the relationship between image texture and S. noctilio infestation levels. Individual correlations were average in strength. Consequently, a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was undertaken to determine whether a selection of texture images could result in a more accurate prediction of S. noctilio infestation levels. A strong correlation of r = 0.7 between the predicted and the observed levels of S. noctilio infestation using the developed multiple linear regression model showed that image texture is a promising tool for the detection, and ultimately mapping, of S. noctilio infestation in plantations. The result is critical for improving the management of insect infestation in plantations of South Africa.",

Agricultural and/or household use of insecticides has been implicated in the development of resistance in An. gambiae. However, such studies had not been carried out in Ghana, where large-scale use of insecticide-treated bed nets is a major component of the Roll Back Malaria programme. There is therefore a need to establish baseline information on patterns of insecticide use and vector susceptibility levels in Ghana. A questionnaire survey of 171 households with 800 inhabitants was conducted to obtain information on knowledge, attitude and perception of respondents on household insecticide use in the Accra metropolis. Also, adult An. gambiae were tested for resistance to permethrin and deltamethrin using WHO adult mosquito test kits. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of the kdr mutation in the test mosquitoes and to identify sibling species within the An. gambiae complex. Results indicated a high frequency of household pyrethroid insecticide use with respondents preferring aerosols to insecticide-impregnated coils. The use of anti-mosquito screens on doors and windows was very high (77 %) but use of bed nets was low (5 %). There was no significant difference in the reported incidence of malaria in all socioeconomic classes. All of the mosquito specimens examined were found to be An. gambiae s.s. Bioassay mortalities were 76 % (range: 72–80 %) for deltamethrin and 74.74 % (range 68–85 %) for permethrin, indicating the existence of resistance to these two insecticides in An. gambiae populations in Accra. The kdr mutation was found in 81.3 % of the survivors of the bioassays and in 8.8 % of the test mortalities. There was a strong correlation between resistance and the occurrence of kdr.",

Despite being easy to rear in the laboratory and having been released in large numbers (>350 000) and widely distributed at many field sites, the beetle remains scarce where present and has failed to persist at many of the original release sites. Although eggs are oviposited readily on loose seeds in dishes, the few eggs that were found at release sites in the field were always on seeds still attached to pods hanging on plants. High levels of predation and parasitism were recorded in the field, which may be hindering population expansion by the beetle. Clarity about the taxonomic status of S. subsuturalis, and uncertainty as to the centre of origin of the weed, have led to suspicions that C. decapetala may exist as several biotypes, and that the local variety may not be a suitable host for the form of S. subsuturalis that has been imported into South Africa. These uncertainties should be addressed, together with additional efforts to determine what is happening to the agent in the field. Other phytophagous species from different feeding-guilds need to be investigated as potential biological control agents.",

    "abstract": "A systematic revision of the mealybug genus Delottococcus Cox & Ben-Dov is presented. Nine species are treated, including D. millari which is described as new. The eight previously described species are: Delottococcus aberiae (De Lotto), D. confusus (De Lotto), D. elisabethae (Brain), D. euphorbiae (Ezzat & McConnell), D. phylicus (De Lotto), D. proteae (Hall), D. quaesitus (Brain), and D. trichiliae (Brain). Adult females of all species are described and illustrated and a key for their identification is presented. In the past, specimens determined as D. elisabethae have been recorded from citrus and other hosts, but these appear to be misidentifications of D. aberiae. Delottococcus elisabethae is only known from the original collection. As invasive species, D. confusus is reported from California and Hawaii, D. aberiae from Spain, and D. euphorbiae from France, Italy, and Sicily.",

    "abstract": "Post-release monitoring of transgenic Bt maize fields for resistant pest populations is an important activity that will contribute to early identification and mitigation of resistance evolution by target pests. An effective Bt maize pest resistance monitoring programme relies on well-established baseline susceptibility data. The target pest of Bt maize in South Africa, Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has evolved resistance to Bt maize expressing Cry1Ab proteins, with numerous reports of resistance from the highveld region of the country. Although Bt maize has been cultivated in the Eastern Cape province since 2001, no data exist on the resistance status of field populations of B. fusca to Bt maize in this region. In view of this, B. fusca larvae were collected from fields in two Bt maize cultivating areas and a non-Bt maize cultivating area of the Eastern Cape for laboratory assays to determine the level of susceptibility of B. fusca to Bt maize. Rearing colonies of each population were established and neonate larvae from each population were used to infest non-Bt maize plants, and Bt maize of events MON810 and MON89034. All larvae maintained on MON89034 died within seven days of infestation. Survival of all B. fusca populations maintained on MON810 declined rapidly during the first seven days and was significantly (P<0.001) lower than larval survival on non-Bt maize. Similarly, mass of surviving larvae of all populations on MON810 from the first two weeks to the 21st day was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than the mass of larvae on non-Bt maize. These results indicate that fieldcollected populations screened in this study are still susceptible to Bt maize.",

The pathogenicity of six indigenous isolates of Beauveria bassiana (BIITAC) and Metarhizium anisopliae (MIITAC) to the fourth and fifth nymphal stages of S. singularis was evaluated under laboratory conditions. Two methods of inoculation were tested at various conidial concentrations: (1) immersing the pod in 200 ml of the suspension for 3 min (ingestion method) and (2) immersing each insect in 1 ml of the suspension for 5 s (immersion method). Tween® 80 at 0.1 % (v/v) was used as a control. After 14 days from initial exposure to conidia, corrected mortality ranged from 35 to 100% for immersion and from 16 to 94.3% for ingestion. Mortalities due to fungi isolates were significantly different from that of their control (P < 0.05). The effect of immersion was more significant than that of ingestion, and mortalities increased with increasing spore concentration. Mycelial outgrowth and sporulation after seven days on some of the dead insects, kept on humidified filter paper in dark conditions, demonstrated that death was due to fungal infection (mycosis). Based on pathogenicity results, LC50, LT50 and LT90 fungal outgrowth, B. bassiana isolates BIITAC10.3.3, BIITAC6.2.2, MIITAC6.2.2 and the M. anisopliae isolate MIITAC11.3.4 could be selected for their virulence, and advanced to field trials for the development of microbial control.",

    "abstract": "The South African citrus industry is dependent on export of fresh fruit to many markets around the world, with approximately 70 % of South Africa’s citrus crop being exported (CGA 2013). The false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is recorded as a pest of citrus fruit in southern Africa (Newton 1998; Grout & Moore 2015). As a result of its endemism to sub-Saharan Africa (Moore 2002), certain export markets of importance for the South African citrus industry, such as Peoples Republic of China, U.S.A. and South Korea, regulate it as a quarantine pest. Control of the pest in the field can be highly effective, using a suite of integrated control options, applied with diligent management (Moore & Hattingh 2012). These can succeed in reducing T. leucotreta infestation by 97 % or more (Moore et al. 2015). Such an integrated system, using the sterile insect technique as the mainstay of the programme, has succeeded in reducing moth catches by 99 %, fruit infestation by 96 % and export rejections by 89 % in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, since the inception of the programme in 2007 (Barnes et al. 2015). Despite the potential efficacy of such control strategies, some export markets still require mandatory post-harvest cold treatment of citrus fruit as a phytosanitary risk mitigation measure for T. leucotreta (SA-DAFF 2014). The cold treatment developed for T. leucotreta by Myburgh (1965) entails maintenance of the fruit at temperatures below 0 °C for 22 days. Such treatment is not only costly to apply, but there is a high risk of the fruit developing chilling injury (Lafuente et al. 2003; Cronje 2007). Some citrus fruit types are able to tolerate such cold treatment, if carefully managed (Lafuente & Zacarias 2006). However, some other citrus types are highly sensitive to cold damage and this cold treatment is not a feasible risk mitigation measure for commercial export of these types (Lafuente & Zacarias 2006). Lemons are highly sensitive to cold damage and cannot withstand exposure to temperatures below 0 °C for 22 days (Underhill et al. 1999; Lafuente & Zacarias 2006). Although standalone postharvest quarantine treatments, such as cold treatment, are still the most commonly used phytosanitary risk mitigation measure (Paull & Armstrong 1994), a range of alternative options, including non-host status, are increasingly being adopted (Liquido et al. 1995; Aluja et al. 2004; Follett & Neven 2006; Follett & Hennessey 2007; Pringle et al. 2015). Pringle et al. (2015) indicated that there are no definitions of host status of fruit specifically for tortricid pests, but referred to the following definitions that Aluja & Mangan (2008) applied to host status for Tephritidae: a natural host is one that is infested under totally natural field conditions. A non-natural host (or conditional host) is not known to be infested under natural field conditions, but there is experimental evidence that it can be infested and produce reproductive adults under laboratory (artificial) conditions. A non-host is one in which development cannot be completed. Pringle et al. (2015) also applied the following definitions provided by NAPPO (2008): a conditional host may be a host or non-host depending on suitability of conditions (e.g. stage of maturity, other physiological conditions or physical conditions), whereas a natural non-host does not become infested in nature. Most importantly, Pringle et al. (2015) followed NAPPO (2008) in its guidelines on determination of host status from natural infestation by evaluating infestation during the export harvest season, as a mandatory requirement in determining host status for phytosanitary purposes, regardless of data from field cage, greenhouse or laboratory trials. This approach to establishing host status was adopted by Armstrong (1991), who declared Sharwil avocados non-hosts (when attached to the tree) for oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), and Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), after inspection of 114 000 fruit",

Diverse modes of reproduction (thelytokous and sexual reproduction) are one of the advantages for rapid colonization and outbreak of this species. Understanding the reproductive strategies is advantageous for us to explore the invasive mechanisms. Importantly, how to identify both sexes of the species in the field is a crucial issue before we explore their reproductive strategies. In the current study, indexes of rapid identification of both sexes in L. invasa were studied. Results showed that the obvious differences in both sexes were the antenna and body size. Male wasps have three anelli and four funicular segments, but in females there are four and three segments, respectively. The longer male antennae, which are covered with longer and finer hairs than in the female, was also observed. Body, expansus, head, and gaster sizes of female wasps were significantly larger than the males. These results are an important base not only for exploring the reproductive strategies, but also for controlling L. invasa.",

Although fungus gnats are principally mycophagous, they have also been described as opportunistic herbivores, making them important plant pests. They are primarily a problem in high moisture conditions. They cause direct damage on the plant through larval feeding and indirect damage through creation of entry points for plant pathogens. They also transfer fungal diseases between plants. The most important species that have been described as pests are Bradysia coprophila Lintner and Bradysia impatiens Johannsen. The latter is regarded as synonymous to Bradysia difformis, has a global distribution and has recently been identified in South African forest pine nursery beds. Control has mainly been achieved through the use of chemical insecticides, but also, to a considerable extent, the use of biocontrol agents such as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). The use of EPNs is preferred, since fungus gnats are pests of such crops as mushrooms and vegetables that have a short lifecycle, or of houseplants that are in very close association with human beings. Control usingEPNshas mainly been achieved through the use of Steinernema feltiae.",

The levels of dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total dissolved solids, turbidity and nutrients affected the distribution of tolerant taxa. The number and diversity of macroinvertebrates were found to be higher at less degraded upstream sites compared to more degraded downstream sites. A canonical analysis clearly grouped the various macroinvertebrates with the physico-chemical parameters having an influence on their distribution. The relatively high influence of environmental factors in the abundance and distribution of the sensitive taxa highlights the importance of environmental variation on macroinvertebrate assemblages.",

Population growth was correlated to average temperature, month and host availability. The highest percentage of damaged fruits (77.16 %) and the highest rates of infestation (41.27 %, B. dorsalis/kg) were recorded during January.

This study was conducted to predict the potential distribution of B. dorsalis in the southern African region using suitable environmental variables and some feral host plants. Presence data from surveillance information carried out in Mozambique and Swaziland up to 2013 were used for niche modelling to predict the potential geographical distribution of the pest in the southern African region. Prediction for its national distribution within Swaziland was also carried out using distribution data for eight feral host plants. Although variable between countries, predicted habitat suitability for the pest was potentially greater in the eastern parts of southern Africa, with response curves suggesting higher probability of the pest's occurrence in low altitude areas with moderate diurnal temperature and high precipitation during the wettest month of the year. Of the host plants considered, the pest's distribution was associated mainly with Ficus sycomorus. The model's prediction also suggested that human-associated activities, such as irrigation, could influence the distribution and establishment of the pest even in areas of low host-plant richness. Since the presence of B. dorsalis causes restrictions in international trade of its host plants, it is imperative that countries within the region continue surveillance programmes and coordinated strategies to reduce the impact of the pest.",

Both species are solitary larva-pupal endoparasioids attacking the same larval stage. In order to assess whether these two species compete or co-exist, an interaction study involving sole, sequential and simultaneous releases of the two species on polyphagous Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) was conducted in the laboratory at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Nairobi, Kenya. Simultaneous releases of 50 individuals each of the two parasitoids resulted in significantly higher total parasitism rate (61.96±4.60) than in the single release of P. scabriventris (34.94±8.50). Simultaneous release of 25 individuals of each species resulted in a parasitism rate (44.52 ± 2.75) similar to that obtained for single releases of 50 individuals of O. dissitus (42.57 ± 3.35) and P. scabriventris (34.94 ± 8.50). No significant effect was observed in total parasitism between sequential and single releases of 50 individuals of each species. The specific parasitism rate of each parasitoid species in the simultaneous release of 50 individuals of each species was not significantly different from when each species was released alone. The first introduced parasitoid in sequential releases achieved the same parasitism rate as when released alone. However, the second released species gave a significantly lower parasitism rate than when released alone and compared to the first released species. The F1 progeny sex ratio was balanced for P. scabriventris but male-biased inO. dissitus. The sex ratios of both parasitoid species were not significantly affected, neither in simultaneous nor sequential releases, except in one of the sequential release where P. scabriventris was released second, with its sex ratio significantly female-biased. Non-reproductive host mortality was not important for both parasitoids when used alone and in combined releases compared to the natural mortality observed in the control. These findings suggest that P. scabriventris has no detrimental effect onO. dissitus and its release into Kenya's agricultural ecosystems will enhance the management of Liriomyza leafminer.",

Currently an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy is followed. However, chemical control still plays an important role in the control of this pest. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) of the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae have been successfully utilized as biological control agents in classical, conservation, and augmentative insect pest management programmes. In this review different biological control options for control of codling moth are considered, with special emphasis on research being done on the biological control of codling moth using EPNs. To integrate nematodes into an IPM system, it is important to conduct research under local environmental conditions for a specific crop. Application of EPNs against codling moth will target the diapausing larval overwintering population above-ground. Especially for commercial application, the unique environmental conditions in the various production areas need to be assessed to allow for the effective use of various EPN species. Orchard application, onto trees poses its own unique challenges with regard to the inundative application of EPNs.

    "abstract": "Blattella germanica (L.) (Blattaria: Blattellidae), the German cockroach, is worldwide the most invasive pest of dwellings, with an increasing resistance to various groups of insecticides. To prevent this problem, special attention is being paid to the new bait insecticides with novel action mechanisms. Therefore, a survey was designed to consider bait efficacy containing abamectin (Vendetta®), dinotefuran (Alpine®), imidacloprid (Invict Gold™) and pyriproxyfen + abamectin (Vendetta Plus®) against the German cockroach. Six cockroach strains including susceptible (reference strain), and five fresh field strains were used in the study. To achieve bait efficacy, the experiments and bait placements were designed according to the WHO (World Health Organisation) method. Although the cockroach strains fed on and were attracted to all investigated baits, baits containing abamectin B1 and pyriproxyfen + abamectin B1 were ingested at higher rates than baits containing dinotefuran and imidacloprid. Based on rank of bait consumption it was concluded that the rank of the bait attractiveness are baits containing abamectin, pyriproxyfen + abamectin, dinotefuran and imidacloprid in this order. While it seems that the efficacy of the dinotefuran and imidacloprid baits would be better than the pyriproxyfen + abamectin and abamectin baits due to them achieving 100 % cumulative mortality rates after cockroach feeding of 2 days (48 h) and 2 days (48 h) than 6 days (164 h) and 7 days (188 h), respectively. Based on results of the study, baits containing abamectin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and abamectin + pyriproxyfen can be recommended to control B. germanica.",

    "abstract": "In the current study, insecticidal activity, growth regulation, adult performance and repellency of petroleum ether, methanol, chloroform and ethanol extracts of Salix safsaf leaves were tested against third instar larvae of the housefly, Musca domestica. Different concentrations were applied through larval feeding to further investigate different biological aspects. Obtained data revealed that mortality percentages among the third instar larvae and pupal stage increased with increasing concentration. Moreover, larval and pupal duration was remarkably lengthened in a concentration-dependent manner vs the control. Furthermore, pupation and adult emergence percentages were inversely decreased with applied concentrations. The LC50 and LC90 values may be arranged as follows: petroleum ether (467.714 and 793.348 ppm), methanol (423.22 and 710.18 ppm), chloroform (533.55 and 942.88 ppm) and ethanol (384.90 and 712.33 ppm), respectively, compared with synthetic insecticide deltamethrin as a positive control that showed an LC50 value of 0.889 ppm and LC90 of 1.367 ppm. Overall, the toxic effects of methanol and ethanol extracts of S. safsaf could compete with the synthetic insecticide deltamethrin as a natural insecticide in the control. Different tested extracts affected the adult longevity, pre-maturation period, maturation period and post-maturation period in a delayed manner. Tested extracts exhibited potent repellency action that reached about 67.0 % for petroleum ether and 87.3 % for ethanol extract at a concentration of 800 ppm. Generally, S. safsaf leaf extracts may be considered as a potent candidate for housefly control and could be exploited as a component of integrated vector control strategies that may help in developing future safe and cheap insecticides of natural origin.",

    "abstract": "The annual herb, Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae: Heliantheae) is a severe terrestrial invader globally. Infestations reduce crop yield, limit available grazing, hinder conservation efforts, and affect human and animal health in Africa, Asia and Australia, and on associated islands. Due to the impact and threat of further invasion of P. hysterophorus, a biological control (biocontrol) programme was initiated in 2003 in South Africa. This review discusses the research and implementation activities undertaken on the insect agents from 2011 to 2020. During this period, the stem-boring weevil Listronotus setosipennis Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), leaf-feeding beetle Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and seed-feeding weevil Smicronyx lutulentus Dietz (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were found to be host specific and approved for release. Releases of mass-reared insect agents have been concentrated particularly in north-eastern South Africa, where P. hysterophorus infestations are most prolific. Post-release monitoring studies indicated localised establishment and impact of L. setosipennis and S. lutulentus. Listronotus setosipennis persisted through severe drought conditions, and although it disperses slowly, larval feeding is structurally damaging. Establishment of S. lutulentus is improving, reducing seed production where it is established. Zygogramma bicolorata resulted in defoliation at a few sites, but establishment has been poor and the beetle has been absent since 2019. Although a combination of fungal and insect agents were demonstrated to reduce P. hysterophorus, additional natural enemies could improve control. Consequently, the stem-galling moth Epiblema strenuana Walker (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and root-crown boring moth Carmenta sp. nr. ithacae (Beutenmüller) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) remain under evaluation. The management of P. hysterophorus in South Africa has been guided by the development of a national strategy, which incorporates multiple management methods, including biocontrol. International collaborations have intensified as a growing number of countries begin to utilize biocontrol to manage P. hysterophorus. Despite the progress towards biocontrol of P. hysterophorus during this period, increased utilisation of approved agents and the introduction of additional agents are necessary to achieve greater control.",

    "abstract": "The Northern Temperate Weeds programme is a novel biological control (biocontrol) programme started in 2017, with the aim of reducing the impacts of northern temperate weeds that are common, widespread and problematic in the high elevation grasslands of South Africa. As these regions are the most important systems for water security, providing nearly 50% of all water run-off, it is surprising that these species were not targeted for biocontrol previously. Thus far, research has focused on biocontrol feasibility as well as ecological and socio-economic impact studies on several northern temperate weeds, including Pyracantha angustifolia (Franch.) C.K.Schneid, Rosa rubiginosa L., Cotoneaster spp., Rubus spp., (all Rosaceae) and Salix spp. (Salicaceae). In addition, research conducted in the USA and Europe on the natural enemies associated with two of these species, Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Gleditsia triacanthos L. (both Fabaceae and native to the USA), have provided South African researchers with the necessary foundation to initiate programmes against these weeds. Research in South Africa is currently focused on pre-release studies on R. pseudoacacia, using the leaf miner Odontota dorsalis Thunberg (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and the black locust midge Obolodiplosis robiniae Haldeman (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and on G. triacanthos, using a seed bruchid, Amblycerus robiniae F.

    "abstract": "Lantana camara L. 'lantana' continues to pose economic and ecological challenges in South Africa. The present review provides a brief overview of biological control (biocontrol) agents established in South Africa, including their combined impact and individual performance of four agents released during the recent past. In total, 16 biocontrol agents are fully established on lantana in South Africa, and three of these are either indigenous or inadvertently introduced into the country. Despite the establishment of these agents, biocontrol of lantana is not effectively reducing the density of the weed, particularly in the inland regions of the country. However, recent studies showed that biocontrol is causing a significant reduction in plant growth, biomass and seed production at various sites in the coastal region of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and the continental area of Mpumalanga province. The sap-sucking mirid Falconia intermedia has been observed to resurge at a number of sites following its crashing countrywide after its release in 1999. Falconia intermedia is, however, still confined to the warm low-lying regions of the country. The flower-galling mite Aceria lantanae has dispersed widely throughout South Africa and some neighbouring countries. The mite reduced flower production of susceptible varieties by up to 97% in the humid coast of KZN. Eleven years after its release, the root-feeding flea beetle Longitarsus bethae is still largely confined to the vicinity of its release sites, where it is severely damaging lantana. Although populations of the petiole weevil Coelocephalapion camarae collapsed at many sites following its release, the weevil has persisted for over 15 years at two isolated sites in KZN province. Efforts are being made to mass rear and redistribute L. bethae and C. camarae in order to improve their establishment and dispersal rate. To cope with varietal resistance and climatic extremes, attempts to find new strains of the existing and promising biocontrol agents are continuing. To justify the continued development of additional agents, the ecological and economic benefits of biocontrol should be assessed, particularly in the coastal region where biocontrol is more effective.",

    "abstract": "The insecticidal effect of four crude olive pomace oils extracted from pomace collected from four localities of Kabylia, refined olive pomace oil and extra virgin olive oil were assessed under laboratory conditions for the control of adults of Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius, 1792) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae)) and Sitophilus oryzae (Linnaeus, 1763) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The doses used ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 ml/25 g of durum and soft wheat seeds. In addition, the quality indices and the fatty acid composition of these oils were evaluated. The results show that the legal quality indices were well within the legal limits for crude olive-pomace oil (COP), refined pomace oil (ROP) and extra-virgin olive oil (EVO) categories. The effectiveness of these vegetable oils is highly dependent on the insect species, the dose rate, the exposure time and the type of oil tested The main fatty acids from all samples tested, were oleic (61.89–79.25%), palmitic (8.34–15.71%) and linoleic (8.17–16.52%) acids. For both species and substrates tested, mortality is dose and time of exposure dependent. The highest dose (0.4 ml/25 g) causes ≥ 63.75% mortality, after 24 h of exposure. Comparison of LD50 (ml/25 g) indicates that olive oil was generally more toxic than crude and refined pomace oils, for both insects and substrates, values varies from 0.005 to 0.189. The most sensitive insect was S. oryzae for most vegetable oils tested. Likewise, oils significantly reduced the F1 offspring of both insects and seed weight losses. No progeny were observed in the two pests at the highest dose, and therefore no weight loss was recorded. The results also revealed that the six oils affect the germination capacity of durum and soft wheat seeds when the dosage is increased. The results collected remain encouraging for the recommendation of natural substances as part of integrated pest management programmes against insect pests of stored grains.",

Mosquitoes attracted to humans at night were caught in August, September and October 2000, coinciding with the peak malaria period in these areas. A total of 2176 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected, of which An. gambiae s.l. was predominant followed by An. Funestus and An. Hancocki. The results of PCR-based tests identified 58.8 % of the An. gambiae s.l. as An. gambiae s.s., and 41.2% as An. Arabiensis. The molecular (M and S) forms of An. gambiae s.s. were found in the ratio 1:3, respectively. A cocktail PCR-assay differentiated 65.6% of the An. Funestus group as An. funestus s.s., and 34.4% as An. Rivulorum. Outdoor biting mosquito numbers were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that observed indoors. Peak indoor and outdoor biting activities of An. gambiae s.s. occurred at 01:00 and 24:00, respectively. The biting activities of An. funestus s.s. both indoors and outdoors attained a peak at 23h00 while An. Arabiensis and An. Rivulorum were more exophagic. The results of ELISA-based analyses indicated that An. gambiae s.s., An.

The aims of this study were to determine the seasonal phenology of P. xylostella populations on canola, and the composition, relative abundance and seasonal phenology of parasitoids attacking P. xylostella on this crop. Diamondback moth adults were monitored with synthetic sex-pheromone traps. Larval and pupal populations of P. xylostella were monitored weekly for three years at Bapsfontein and Rietondale in Gauteng province. Samples of diamondback moth larvae, pupae and parasitoid cocoons were collected and transported to the laboratory. Parasitoids that emerged were identified and their incidence recorded. Berlese funnel catches were used as an indicator of the accuracy of the visual counts. The infestation level of P. xylostella larvae was high from May to August at Rietondale, while at Bapsfontein it was high from September to December. There was a high correlation (r=0.79, P<0.001) between pheromone trap catches and subsequent larval infestations at Bapsfontein. The pheromone traps indicated that diamondback moth adults were present throughout the year. Berlese funnel catches indicated that a large number of larvae, especially first instars, were overlooked during visual plant scouting. Parasitism rates were often very high, reaching 90-100 %. The following parasitoids were recorded from field-collected P. xylostella : the larval parasitoids Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) (Hymenoptera : Braconidae) and Apanteles halfordi Ullyett (Hymenoptera : Braconidae), the larval / pupal parasitoids Diadegma mollipla (Holmgren) (Hymenoptera : Ichneumonidae) and Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Hymenoptera : Eulophidae), the pupal parasitoid Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera : Ichneumonidae), and the hyperparasitoids Mesochorus sp.

    "abstract": "Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (Froggatt) was introduced into South Africa in 1982 for the biological control of Acacia longifolia (Andr.) Willd. (Fabaceae). Since its introduction it has substantially reduced the reproductive potential of this weed and is widely regarded as a successful biological control agent. Nonetheless, with growing concern about the risks of biological control, follow-up monitoring of agents that have been released is strongly advocated. The present contribution examines the geographical range expansion and success of T. acaciaelongifoliae 18 years after its release. This study was carried out at a locality with climatic conditions similar to those that were originally predicted to be unsuitable for T. acaciaelongifoliae.The level of infestation and success of T. acaciaelongifoliae on Acacia floribunda Sieber at the study site in Gauteng Province was found to compare favourably with its performance in the most successful areas of its release. Although climatic matching may be important for the initial establishment of biocontrol agents, in the long-term it is clear that these species are potentially able to expand their geographical ranges. The sex ratio of T. acaciaelongifoliae was strongly female-biased, unlike that previously recorded on A. floribunda. The level of parasitism by a single, newly acquired parasitoid species was unexpectedly high. However, no relationship was found between the fate of T. caciaelongifoliae individuals in galls and gall size. Although this species is an effective biocontrol agent, its long-term behavior (range expansion and association with local natural enemies) has proved to be less predictable.",

Plots (5 ×5m) were arranged in a 6 × 6 Latin square design. Natural infestation by stem borers was allowed to take place. The stem borers found on host plants were Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) and Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae). The incidence of whorl damage, dead heart and stem damage observed indicated that all host plants were susceptible to stem borer attack. Cultivated host plants showed higher incidences of whorl and stem damage than the grasses. The low incidence of whorl damage on the grasses may be ascribed to larval antixenosis at the feeding site. Quicker larval development as well as increased size was observed on cultivated crops than on the grasses. The results of this study indicated better colonization of cultivated crops by the stem borers compared with the grasses.",

Members of the Anopheles gambiae complex constitute the primary vectors of malaria in Zimbabwe. Four members of the complex were found in various combinations of sympatry, including An. gambiae s.s. Giles, An. Arabiensis Patton, An. Merus Donitz and An. Quadriannulatus Theobald (species A). The wide distribution of An. Arabiensis, often in association with the non-vector An. Quadriannulatus, confirmed its status as the principal vector. The patchily distributed species, An. Merus, was implicated in malaria transmission at Masakadza, Gokwe District. Anopheles gambiae s.s. was found in the Zambezi Valley area of Kanyemba, while An. Funestus Giles was detected at Humani Ranch, Chiredzi District, in the southeast lowveld of Zimbabwe. The scarcity of previously abundant vector species is attributed to insecticide spray programmes that commenced in the 1980s. DDT resistance was detected in An. Arabiensis collected from market gardens in Gokwe suggesting that agrochemicals used on crops may have induced the resistance. Tests in other areas indicated continued susceptibility of the An. Gambiae complex to all four classes of insecticides available for public health purposes. Up to date information on species distributions is essential for implementing effective control strategies and for managing insecticide resistance in vectors of malaria.",

    "abstract": "Field surveys conducted in Argentina proved Plectonycha correntina Lacordaire (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) to be a promising biocontrol agent against the Neotropical perennial climber, Anredera cordifolia (Tenore) Steenis (Basellaceae), a serious environmental weed in Africa and Australasia. Larvae and adults feed on the leaves. The host range was evaluated by no-choice larval survival tests and adult feeding and oviposition choice tests. Sixteen plant test species were selected from the Basellaceae (4 species), Portulacaceae (4), Crassulaceae (3), Cactaceae (3) and Aizoaceae (2) families. Larval development could only be completed on species of Basellaceae (A. cordifolia, Anredera krapovickasii (Villa) Sperling, Basella alba Linné, Ullucus tuberosus Caldas). The other test plant species sustained larval development for less than 96 hours. In multiple-choice tests involving plant species outside the Basellaceae, both in the presence and in the absence of A. cordifolia, P. correntina showed an almost complete preference for its natural host. Larvae that emerged from the few eggs laid on Talinum paniculatum (Jacquin) Gaertner (Portulacaceae) and Pereskia grandifolia Haworth (Cactaceae) died within 48 hours, without feeding. In the test among the Basellaceae, feeding and oviposition preference of P. correntina for A. cordifolia and B. alba were significantly higher than for A. krapovickasii and U. tuberosus. In multiple-choice and paired-choice feeding and oviposition tests, and in fecundity tests, P. correntina displayed a significantly greater preference for Madeira vine than for B. alba. The results indicate that the host range of P. correntina is restricted to the Basellaceae, with A. cordifolia as its primary host. Consequently, we consider P. correntina a safe and promising biocontrol agent for Madeira vine in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where no other Basellaceae occur.",

South Africa and Swaziland, two sugarcane producers neighbouring Mozambique, have some of the most comprehensive temperature data sets in Africa and the aim of this study was to use these data to generate maps depicting these countries' vulnerability, in terms of climate, to invasion by C. sacchariphagus. Three maps based on a mortality index, a maintenance index and a mating index, respectively, were generated for the region. For comparison, similar index values were generated for a site in Réunion where the borer is well established. The climatic potential for the pest in South Africa and Swaziland is below that of Réunion. The KwaZulu-Natal coastline of South Africa and adjacent deep river valleys, especially in the north, are the most vulnerable parts in the region.

The result of the bioassay showed that at 25 °C and 30 °C, all the isolates were virulent. Accordingly, cumulative target percentage mortality of Aphis gossypii at 25 °C varied from 73.33–93.33 % mortality and LT50 ranged from 3.83 to 4.98 days while percentage cumulative target mortality and LT50 values at 30 °C ranged from 82.22–100 % and 3.23–4.02 days, respectively. A statistically significant interaction between fungal isolates and temperature indicated that the pathogenic nature of an isolate was dependent on the temperature conditions of the bioassay.

(Myrtaceae): a bud-galling midge, Dasineura strobila Dorchin (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), which was inadvertently introduced, possibly in the mid-1980s, and a leaf-mining moth, Aristaea (Parectopa) thalassias (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), which was released in 1996. The latter agent attacks young leaves only and has no discernible impact on mature trees. The number of L. laevigatum buds on mature trees that are galled by D. strobila was monitored from 1994 until 2008. Initially the prognosis for biological control by D. strobila was extremely promising. However, the numbers of galls then declined sharply at most of the sites, on average to less than half of their previous peak levels. Gall-midge mortality, induced by native parasitoids, was very low initially, and, some years later, peaked at an average of only about 8 %. In 2004, predatory mites, mostly Pyemotes species (Trombidiformes: Pyemotidae), were discovered, killing an average of 27% (9.8–61.3%) of the D. strobila larvae and pupae in the galls, but their role in regulating populations of D. strobila has not been proven. A chemical exclusion experiment on seedlings showed that leaf damage by A. thalassias together with galling by D. strobila reduced the growth of young L. laevigatum plants by nearly 50%, but, again, the impact of the two agents in aggregate, on mature plants, is negligible. A gall-inducing scale insect is presently under consideration as a potential agent, and there are some other possible agents that might be useful, but, overall, the prospects for biological control of L. laevigatum do not appear to be good.",

The developmental time of larvae fed on different diets ranged from 9.3 to 16.2 days, and the artificial diet-grown larvae showed a significantly longer developmental time than those fed on Sitotroga cerealella eggs or Chaitophorus populeti. They also showed a lower adult emergence rate, which were only 3.6% to 16.0 %, while it was 90.0 % on C. populeti and 72.1 % on S. cerealella eggs. The C. populeti was the best diet in terms of reproduction, because of the shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity of its females compared to the females on artificial diets and S. cerealella eggs. In order to evaluate the potential of S. cerealella eggs for rearing H. axyridis as a supplementary prey, its effect on the fecundity of H. axyridis was tested. The results revealed that for adults fed on C. populeti, their larval food source had no significant effect on duration of pre-oviposition period (8.6 and 7.5 days) and fecundity (737.2 and 739.8). However, when the ladybeetles were fed with C. populeti as larval food and S. cerealella eggs as adult food or S. cerealella eggs alone, the fecundity of H. axyridis dramatically decreased. These results suggest that S. cerealella eggs only can be used as supplementary diet for H. axyridis larvae when natural prey is inadequate or absent, and the artificial diets in this paper show low values.",

To identify further soft scale vectors of GLRaV-3, the ability of three species, Coccus longulus, Parasaissetia nigra and a Saissetia sp., to transmit the virus to grapevine was determined under laboratory conditions. Using cultured soft scales, first-instar nymphs of C. longulus and P. nigra were given acquisition access to GLRaV-3-infected rootstock hybrid LN33. Saissetia sp. was reared on LN33 infected with GLRaV-3 and Grapevine virus A (GVA). Nymphs were transferred from virus source to virus-free grapevine plants (cv. Cabernet franc). Recipient plants were tested for GLRaV-3 and GVA with nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) and RT-PCR, respectively. The study shows for the first time that C. longulus, P. nigra and a Saissetia sp. are vectors of GLRaV-3. Saissetia sp. did not transmit GVA. The biology of C. longulus and P. nigra on grapevine was examined at different constant temperatures ranging between 18 and 35 °C, and at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. None of the nymphs survived past the second-instar stage except for one C. longulus female at 30 °C, which produced 117 offspring. The low survival rate could explain the low abundance and patchy distribution of soft scales in South African vineyards. However, outbreaks of soft scales in European vineyards have been reported and this study shows that more soft scale insect species than hitherto thought are able to transmit the virus.",

Both A. mexicana and A. ochroleuca colonize and persist in severely disturbed areas, such as cropping systems, along roadsides, railway lines and watercourses. They compete with, and possibly displace indigenous pioneer species, threatening biodiversity of riparian zones in particular. They are also toxic to animals and humans. Although control measures such as herbicides can be applied, their use in sensitive areas such as riparian zones can cause deleterious effects and therefore biological control is considered to be the most suitable and environmentally safe method to suppress these weeds. Accordingly, two species of flower- and fruit-feeding curculionid beetles provisionally identified as Conotrachelus cf. leucophaeatus Fâhraeus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Conotrachelini), and Sirocalodes cf. wickhami (Champion) (Curculionidae: Ceutorhynchini) were collected in Mexico in 2007 and in 2009 and brought to South Africa for evaluation as potential biological control agents. Preliminary host-specificity tests indicated that the beetles strongly prefer the target weeds to other plant species. They are highly damaging and have the potential to substantially reduce seed production and thereby curb the spread of the two Argemone species.",

    "abstract": "Woolly apple aphid (WAA), Eriosoma lanigerum, is an important pest of apples, occurring throughout the apple-growing regions of the world. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) of the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae have generated intensive interest as inundative biocontrol agents of pest insects. Considering resistance of WAA against certain insecticides and the inability of parasitoids to control the aphid successfully early in the season, EPNs offer an alternative biocontrol option. The susceptibility of WAA to seven indigenous EPN species was tested in laboratory bioassays in which Steinernema yirgalemense and Heterorhabditis zealandica were identified as being the most effective against the subterranean adult females of the WAA, with infection rates of 39%and 28 %, respectively. The effect of E. lanigerum size showed that the last instar is most susceptible to infection, whereas none of the crawlers were infected. Increasing the exposure time of the aphids and nematode concentration had no positive effect on the WAA infection rate. On evaluating the ability of infective juveniles of S. yirgalemense and H. zealandica to tolerate exposure to imidacloprid, both nematode species were found to be compatible at the recommended dosage, with no significant nematode mortality having occurred. Neither did imidacloprid affect the ability of the nematodes to infect their hosts after 24 h exposure. The associated bacteria, isolated from 12 EPN isolates, showed a visual inhibitory growth effect, when they were exposed to the haemolymph of WAA. From these results, it is concluded that, although S. yirgalemense showed some infection of WAA, its low mortality and inability to complete its life cycle within the host, limits its effectiveness as a biological control agent against the subterranean stages of WAA in apple orchards.",

Three orders of insects were recorded on the flowers: Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. The majority (81 %) of taxa identified on the plant showed very low average abundances (≤1 individual/day) and 73 % of these taxa were bees and included the honeybee, Apis mellifera, the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, Ceratina cucurbitina and two Megachilidae, Anthidium florentinum and A. manicatum. The bees had higher visitation rates than Lepidopterans (Iphiclides podalirius, Pieris rapae and Polyommatus dorylas). The ‘quantitative’ interaction of the plant with its main visitors, determined by the abundance and the visitation rate, showed that B. terrestris and A. mellifera are the most dominant pollinators of the plant. Analysis of the ‘qualitative’ component of the interaction of L. officinalis with the five major bees by counting pollen grains transported on their bodies revealed that B. terrestris, in addition to its dominance, was also the most efficient pollinator of the plant.",

We used a PCR amplification technique to successfully establish RFLP patterns of the COI coding gene to differentiate the exotic B. invadens from the native Ceratitis species infesting sweet oranges in Nigeria. The universal barcoding primer pair LCO1490/HCO2198 was used to amplify 658 bp-long fragment of the mitochondrial COI coding gene. The amplified fragment was analysed by automated direct sequencing and RFLP. Intraspecific variation in nucleotide sequences of B. invadens was very low with not more than 2 bp substitutions in four out of 31 individuals sequenced. Among the Ceratitis species intraspecific variation was also very low with at most 4 bp substitutions in few of the 32 individuals sequenced. The restriction enzymes Rsa I and Hsp92 II produced patterns that clearly and unambiguously separated B. invadens from Ceratitis spp. DNA barcoding was also used to confirm the identities of the tephritid species analysed. The molecular method established in this study will enhance easy monitoring, early detection of species involved, and implementation of appropriate management programmes that effectively reduce yield loses in Citrus production in Nigeria.",

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses of the genomes of nine populations revealed 125 SNPs in the protein coding genes with the majority of the SNPs occurring in the ND genes, and the least in the ND4L gene. Low SNP variant frequency was also found for the atp6 and atp8 genes, which differed from other reports in the Hemiptera, and may point towards increased importance of these genes in aphid fitness.",

    "abstract": "Pareuchaetes insulata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Arctiinae) was released in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, as a biological control agent against Chromolaena odorata (L.) King & Robinson (Asteraceae) between 2001 and 2009. Although the moth did establish at one out of some 30 release sites, its population level is generally low in the field. Two closely related biological control agents, P. pseudoinsulata Rego Barros and P. aurata aurata (Butler) had previously failed to establish despite several years of releases. Studies of life history traits of P. insulata (males and females) were conducted to determine whether several aspects of its developmental and reproductive biology can explain its poor performance, and to compare the development and reproductive biology of P. insulata with the two other closely related species. At 25 °C, overall mortality of immature stages was generally low (below 12 %). Although the duration of the larval life stage was statistically longer for females, overall they eclosed as adults before the males (i.e. protogyny). Pupal mass, growth rate and total leaf area consumed were higher in females. Mated females laid 74 % of their eggs on the first four nights following eclosion and lived an average of 5.92 ± 0.19 days. The moth also showed good biological attributes such as high fecundity (number of eggs), egg hatchability and female mating success (the number of matings that resulted in fertile eggs). Significant positive correlations were detected between insect performance metrics and leaf consumption and between fecundity and pupal mass. A 23 % greater lifetime reproductive output (387.62 ± 19.50 eggs per female) for P. insulata compared with P. aurata aurata was recorded. We hypothesize that the absence of protandry in P. insulata might have contributed to the low population levels of the moth in the field. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the life history traits of erebid moths in the subfamily Arctiinae deployed for the biological control of C. odorata.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to obtain a seasonal profile of the mound temperatures of a harvester termite, Trinervitermes trinervoides (Sjöstedt), to ascertain whether the temperatures in different regions of the mound were constant across seasonal temperature fluctuations. Temperatures were measured in six mounds in the Melville Koppies Nature Reserve (Johannesburg, South Africa). Unlike most epigeous mound-building termites, their mounds were wholly restricted to the surface with no subterranean component. Brood and queen were found at the core of the mound at the soil interface. Core temperatures were constant on a monthly basis but fluctuated seasonally. They were kept within narrow limits of 20 °C in May (winter air temperatures of 16.80 ± 3.82 °C) and at 30 °C in October (summer air temperatures of 21.4 ± 5.61 °C). Mound architecture was found to be an important influence on core temperatures as the core temperatures in the uninhabited mounds were also kept relatively constant. Large mounds had higher core temperatures than medium mounds during every month except May, but the same pattern of a lowered core temperature during the winter months was also observed. The daily core temperature variation during each month was also less in the larger mounds. The mound structure achieved the equivalent buffering of air temperature as would have possibly occurred if the nest was 20 mm below the surface. The increase in core temperature from August throughout the summer months was attributed to the presence of alate larval instars within the nest. These T. trinervoides colonies were unable to build subterranean nests due to the bedrock layer occurring close to the soil surface, but achieved constant core temperatures through the insulating properties of the mound.",

    "abstract": "Three chalcidoid wasp species, Megastigmus zebrinus Grissell (Torymidae), Quadrastichodella nova Girault (Eulophidae) and Leprosa milga Kim & La Salle (Eulophidae), have each been described independently as gall inducers associated with Eucalyptus species (Myrtaceae). The finding that at times they emerge together from seed capsules of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnhardt) collected at the same site in South Africa, cast doubt on the accuracy of these earlier interpretations. The current study examined the gall inducing abilities of each of the three wasp species. During geographical surveys, all three species coexisted in seed capsules at 16 of the 61 sites sampled. A study of the seasonal emergence pattern of the three species, together with a fourth, locally abundant gall associate, Aprostocetus sp., showed that Q. nova and L. milga emerge during early summer, while the remaining two species emerge in smaller numbers throughout the year. Oviposition trials on sleeved branches of E. camaldulensis, from which all insects had previously been excluded, verified that Q. nova had the ability to induce galls, while both M. zebrinus and L. milga failed to do so. Only one type of gall of characteristic structure was encountered, which repudiates the possibility of a second gall inducer, and no indication of inquilinism was found. Megastigmus zebrinus, L. milga and Aprostocetus sp. are thus more likely to be parasitoids.DNA sequences were obtained for the adults of all four these species. By matching the DNA of identified adults with that of juvenile hymenopterans in the galls, it was confirmed that all four hymenopterans species developed within the seed-capsule galls of E. camaldulensis. Regrettably, this technique failed to give a clear indication of the exact host relationships between the various gall inhabitants. By dissecting seed capsules at different stages of gall development, the origin of the gall was proven to be in the placenta of one of the locules of a flower bud, and not in a seed or ovule, as previously reported.",

The lethal concentrations (LC50) of the Egyptian and exotic Beauveria and Paecilomyces isolates for N. viridula were 323 × 106, 835 × 106 and 281 × 107 conidia/ml, respectively. Although, there was no significant difference observed in the mortality rates of adults exposed to the conidiospores of the fungal isolates, the results demonstrated a concentration-dependent pattern. The conidia showed limited attachment to the insect integument. Interestingly, a positive relationship was observed between the rate of increase in the germination of conidia and that of the exposure time, up to 84–92 % at 48 h post-infection. Furthermore, germination of the isolates on the wings was significantly different. The conidia gave rise to germ tubes at 12 h with bipolar germ tubes and hyphal network at 48 h post-infection. SEM revealed that the Egyptian Beauveria strain damaged both the epicuticle and procuticle at 72 h post-infection with tube penetration in the cuticle and epidermis of both the exotic Beauveria- and Paecilomyces-infected bugs. Many changes were recorded in the cuticular phenoloxidase, fatty acids and hydrocarbons following fungal infection. These results induce direct relationship between the changes in the cuticular composition and the attachment/ germination of the entomopathogenic fungi. These data provide useful information with regard to the applicability of entomopathogenic fungi against N. viridula.",

The level of susceptibility to pyrethroid insecticides (cypermethrin and bifenthrin), activity of carboxylesterase (CarE) and amino acid substitutions in esterase gene of each population were investigated. Insecticide bioassay revealed that Sonepat and Delhi populations of S. litura were 2.2- and 2.1-fold resistant to cypermethrin and bifenthrin, respectively. Delhi and Sonepat populations had elevated activity of enzyme level of 26.47±0.21 and 28.02±0.05, respectively. The Varanasi population (10.09 ± 0.10 μmol/min/mg of protein) exhibited lowest CarE activity. The CarE gene of 500 bp fragment that encodes 167 amino acid residues was characterised in all populations. Cluster analysis of gene sequences revealed that all three populations were 92 to 95% identity and were closely related to other Spodoptera spp. Among the 167 amino acid residues, 27 were identical in all Spodoptera species and seven substitutions were observed. Sequence alignment confirmed no substitution at conserved position and one semiconserved substitution. In the characterised region, the substitution W224S which is responsible for CarE activity reduction in insecticide resistant Culex pipiens was not observed in any of the Spodoptera populations. A strong positive relation (r = 0.99) was observed between the CarE activity and determined LC50. Thus, elevated CarE activity in Delhi and Sonepat field populations was attributed to pyrethroid resistance. Metabolic detoxification mainly appears to be due to overproduction of CarE enzyme in respective populations and not because of amino acid residue changes.",

WFT is extremely polyphagous, attacking a wide range of host plants in both field and greenhouse production systems. Chemical control is the most frequently used method for the control of WFT, but their cryptic nature, which protects them from contact with insecticides, and their resistance to many insecticides, have become critical limiting factors in terms of control. This has led to heightened emphasis on biological control in integrated pest management (IPM) programmes for WFT. Most commonly used predators are relatively large and unable to enter the cryptic spaces inhabited by WFT, thus limiting their ability to reduce WFT populations. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and fungi offer alternative biocontrol options that suit IPM programmes well. This review focuses on WFT and its management, with an emphasis on crops being grown under cover, and on the use of EPNs for biocontrol, from a South African perspective.",

The beetle oviposits on seed pods and on loose seeds of its host. Hatching larvae burrow into the seeds to consume the contents, emerging as adults. Since L. leucocephala seeds and seed pods display considerable variation in size (i.e. resource quality) in the field, a laboratory study was conducted to determine whether size affects utilization by A. macrophthalmus. A seed-switching trial was also carried out to determine whether seed pod or seed size was the most consistent oviposition cue. The beetles displayed strong oviposition preferences for larger resources, with significantly higher egg loads on the largest seeds and seed pods. The seed-switching trials suggested that seed pod size was a more important oviposition cue than seed size. These results were verified by field surveys which revealed significant positive relationships between egg loads and seed pod size at two of the three sites surveyed. Since seed size is positively correlated with germination success and seedling fitness in leguminous plants, these oviposition patterns suggest that, in situations where dehisced seeds are utilized, A. macrophthalmus may be targeting the fittest seeds in L. leucocephala populations. This may have positive, albeit subtle, implications for biological control.",

Both adults and larvae cause considerable damage to horticultural crops and the pest is considered of quarantine importance for export to the European market. In an attempt to understand the behaviour of this pest for formulation of suitable management and mass-rearing strategies, a study was conducted to determine the effect of host plant on preference and performance of L. huidobrensis. Four host plants: Vicia faba L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae) and Lycopersicon esculentum M. (Solanaceae) were evaluated for their suitability for feeding, oviposition, development and pupal survival of L. huidobrensis under no-choice and choice conditions. The conditions simulated monoculture and intercrop systems, respectively. Lycopersicon esculentum was the most preferred host for feeding and oviposition, with mean feeding punctures of 23.34 ± 3.35 and 11.59 ± 1.36 per cm2 for no-choice and choice conditions, respectively, and mean number of eggs of 0.57 ± 0.11 and 0.08 ± 0.04 per cm2 for the no-choice and choice conditions, respectively. However, L. esculentum was least suitable for development of L. huidobrensis, with the lowest number of pupae and adults (2.50 ± 0.73 and 1.38 ± 0.46, respectively), pupal survival rate of 6.05 ± 1.95 % and fitness as measured by female and male wing length of 1.84 ± 0.04 mm and 1.57 ± 0.03 mm, respectively. This makes it the best candidate trap crop for management of this pest. On the other hand, V. faba was the most suitable host plant for development of the pest (42.88 ± 11.80 pupae and 32.13 ± 8.77 adults), pupal survival (65.01 ± 13.86 %) and fitness (2.18 ± 0.03 mm and 1.77 ± 0.04 mm, making it a suitable host for mass rearing of L. huidobrensis. Previous experience (rearing history) of the pest significantly affected the selection for feeding and oviposition, but did not affect host suitability for development. Liriomyza huidobrensis fed and oviposited significantly more under no-choice condition than choice set-up suggesting the potential of mixed cropping in controlling L. huidobrensis infestations.",

    "abstract": "Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Hemiptera: Triozidae), is a minor pest of citrus, but the significance of this triozid is attributed to its ability to vector the African citrus greening disease pathogen, 'Candidatus' Liberibacter africanus. The population fluctuation of T. erytreae is correlated with the flushing rhythm of the citrus host. However, seasonal fluctuation in the infection potential of populations carrying the greening pathogen has been difficult to monitor in the past due to limited detection methodologies. This study explored the fluctuation in infectivity in an orchard severely infected by African greening. Two seasons' data are presented from a small Citrus aurantium (L.) (sour orange) orchard in the Nelspruit district in South Africa. Individual T. erytreae caught weekly on sticky traps placed in the orchard were tested using PCR. Additionally, a T. erytreae outbreak was observed in 2011 in another C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck (sweet orange) orchard which displayed a high incidence of greening also in the Nelspruit district. T. erytreae collected here were used in a challenge study and some transmission data are presented. T. erytreae population fluctuations followed the citrus growth flush cycles and were influenced by specific climatic factors. Fluctuations in the percentage infectivity of the T. erytreae populations were observed, with infectivity peaking with or just after the citrus flush seasons, but with peaks in infectivity differing to peaks in population of the vector. In a challenge study, the percentage pathogen transmission to citrus was much lower than the detected percentage infection of the triozids used for the study.",

    "abstract": "Okra germplasm collected from different locations around the world were screened at AVRDC(The World Vegetable Center) in 2011 and 2012 to identify germplasm resistant to the melon aphid (Aphis gossypii) for use in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 260 okra accessions and varieties were screened (150 at AVRDC Taiwan and 110 at AVRDC Cameroon), which included four varieties commercially available in Cameroon. The experiments were conducted under natural infestation in Shanhua, Taiwan, and at Yaoundé, Cameroon. Since the preliminary screening trials were conducted in Taiwan and Cameroon, the aphid populations in these two countries were compared. A total of 60 insects was used for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequences of all the populations showed 100 % similarity and the phylogenetic analysis confirmed the genetic similarity of A. gossypii in Taiwan and Cameroon. Results of the screening trials showed that three accessions (VI033805, VI036213 and VI051114) were resistant to A. gossypii. The basis of resistance of the three okra accessions was elucidated by studying their biochemical and biophysical properties. There was no significant difference between the susceptible and resistant okra accessions in terms of leaf tannins, free amino acids, total sugars and total phenols. Only total nitrogen was significantly different between the susceptible and the two resistant okra accessions with the lowest aphid infestation (VI033805 and VI036213). Thus, higher leaf nitrogen content seems to favour the aphid infestation on okra. For physical parameters, there was no significant difference among the accessions in trichome density of bottom and middle leaves, and leaf toughness. However, trichome density in the younger leaves of resistant VI033805 was significantly higher than susceptible VI057245. Studies on settling behaviour showed that aphids did not discriminate between the susceptible and resistant okra accessions for oviposition and feeding 72 h after release.",

    "abstract": "Alate aphids respond to short (UV) and long (green—yellow) wavelength stimuli during host-plant searching behaviour. Although many aphids are attracted to yellow, the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, is attracted to green. As part of identifying suitable plant species for crop border plants for seed potatoes, the attraction of R. padi to different shades of green in relation to differences in spectral reflectance of three cultivars of a non-host, potato, and two host-plant species, maize and wheat, were determined. Choice experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions to evaluate aphid landing preference for stimuli of different colours. Rhopalosiphum padi alates preferred to land on the colour targets with the highest reflectance. Significantly more alates landed on yellow and lime colour targets with a maximum wavelength reflectance of 46 % from 600–610 nm and 26 % from 525–531 nm, respectively. The peak light reflectance of the crop plants ranged between 12 % (potato; 532–555 nm) and 20 % (wheat; 537–553 nm). The results on aphid landing preference for different colour targets suggest that R. padi will land in higher numbers on the wheat plants, compared to potato, due to their higher peak percentage reflectance. In addition, the study indicates that the wavelength reflectance curves of plants can be used as a characteristic to select possible crop border plants when making choices between seemingly equally suitable plant species/cultivars.",

The virulence of two entomopathogenic fungal species was studied in laboratory bioassays against the crawlers and adults of P. citri. Isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, collected from citrus orchards in the Eastern Cape Province in SouthAfrica, were verified using and molecular techniques. Mealybug bioassays were performed in 24-well plates. Beauveria bassiana (GAR 17 B3) and M. anisopliae (FCM AR 23 B3) isolates both resulted in 67.5 % mortality of mealybug crawlers and B. bassiana (GB AR 23 13 3) resulted in 64 % crawler mortality with concentrations of 1 × 107 conidia/ml. These three isolates were further tested in multipledose bioassays to determine the median lethal concentration (LC50), which were 5.29 × 105 conidia/ml for the M. anisopliae isolate (FCM AR 23 B3), 4.25 × 106 conidia/ml for B. bassiana (GAR 17 B3), and 6.65 × 107 conidia/ml B. bassiana (GB AR 23 13 3) for crawlers, respectively. The results of this study suggested that two isolates (M. anisopliae FCM AR 23 B3 and B. bassianaGAR 17 B3) showed potential for further development as biological control agents against citrus mealybug.

An entomological survey carried out in June 2015 during the rainy season using “Vavoua” traps guided subsequent control activities. Indeed, it improved knowledge of tsetse fly ecology. All the tsetse flies caught (i.e. 1909) belonged to the subspecies Glossina palpalis palpalis (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), the major vector of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Côte d’Ivoire. In this paper, we looked at the relationship between the apparent density (AD, flies/trap/day) and biotopes. The AD significantly varied according to biotopes, with high density around villages. The trypanosomes overall infection rate (mature and immature) according to microscopic observation was 23.2%. When considering mature infections, the infection rate was 5.5 %. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses confirmed the presence of Trypanosoma brucei s.l. and Trypanosoma congolense “forest type”. Blood meals analysis using cytochrome b gene sequences revealed that tsetse flies fed on pigs. The edges of the villages seem to constitute preferred habitats for tsetse flies where they are protected from insecticide pressure in the fields, and where they can easily take bloodmeals from free-ranging pigs. The findings of this study provided a baseline in decision-making for subsequent vector control activities.",

    "abstract": "Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is an entomopathogenic nematode (EPN), and together with its mutualistic bacteria, is a highly effective insect biocontrol agent. The preferred method for large-scale production involves in vitro liquid culture, whereby the nematode and bacteria are cultivated in an artificial medium that replicates the haemocoel conditions found within the insect host. Although the mass-culturing method for H. bacteriophora has proven successful in other countries, it has still to be implemented as a local commercial product in South Africa, despite its considerable potential for pest control. Several factors impact on the success of an in vitro liquid culture, including the bacterial inoculum density and the ingredients used in the culture media. Thus, this study aimed to develop an in vitro liquid culture protocol for a local isolate of H. bacteriophora. Switching from soy powder to egg yolk powder significantly increased the yield of infective juveniles (IJ) during culture, despite there being no differences in IJ recovery between days 2 to 4 after nematode inoculum. Furthermore, the bacterial inoculum density exerts a significant influence on recovery and yield, with the use of a 2% (v/v) inoculum concentration showing the most favourable results. Bacterial cell density is crucial for IJ recovery, as it provides the food signal that activates the IJ. The success obtained with this liquid culture technique for H. bacteriophora paves the way for the optimisation of various additional liquid culture parameters, including nutrients levels, oxygen concentrations and cost-effective ingredients.",

Results indicated that temperature and relative humidity influenced all life-history parameters of parasitoids. Parasitism of the G0 generation by the Tunisian strain was higher compared to that of the Italian strain at 30 °C (10% RH) (22.33 ± 5.94 and 16.46 ± 6.45, respectively, for the Tunisian and Italian strain) and 35 °C (75% RH) (16.26 ± 5.11 and 11.33 ± 5.81, respectively, for the Tunisian and Italian strain). Furthermore, the parasitism rate is better in the G1 compared to the G0 generation only for the Italian strain at 25–30 °C and at 10, 75 and 100% RH. Emergence was significantly decreased for both strains at 35 °C regardless of the relative humidity level. For the G1 generation, no parasitism and emergence were shown by the Italian strain at 35 °C for all tested relative humidities. Our data indicate the Tunisian strain is adapted to higher temperatures. The implications of these results to improve the biological control of lepidopteran pests are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In the Eastern Cape, natural landscapes that are adjacent to rivers and the sea are threatened by illegal sand mining, which occurs without prior assessment of biodiversity. Sand mining activities lead to the reduction of vegetation cover and plant species richness. Generally, species richness of arthropods correlates positively with plant species richness. Thus, it is important to test the effect of sand mining on arthropod diversity. In this study we compared species richness, abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity and composition of ants, beetles and spiders between sand-mined areas and the surrounding grassland. Arthropods were collected using pitfall traps in eight plots in the sand-mined area and eight plots in the surrounding grassland. The sand-mined area and the grassland supported similar species richness and abundance of arthropods. However, significantly greater diversity was in the surrounding grassland than the sand-mined area. Furthermore, species composition of arthropods between the two areas was significantly different. Additionally, there were 13 morphospecies that were indicators of the sand-mined area, and ten morphospecies that were indicators of the surrounding grassland, while there were no shared indicator species between the two study areas. As such, disturbance-tolerant species that prefer open habitats may have replaced specialist arthropods. Given that our study showed that illegal sand mining changes species composition and reduce the diversity of arthropods, sand mining should be restricted to designated areas to reduce the impact of mining on arthropods and improve conservation.",

In order to effectively investigate the evolutionary history of vectors of disease and understand their associated biological tendencies, it is vital to correctly identify and classify the relevant species. Since phylogenetic studies on South African species are currently markedly underrepresented in the literature, the current study aimed to investigate the placement of South African Anopheles Meigen mosquito species within the genus’ extensive taxonomic framework based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI), internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 28S ribosomal DNA sequences. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed for each of the COI, ITS2 and 28S DNA datasets, as well as a concatenated analysis for all three DNA regions combined. Upon examination, several phylogenetic findings were corroborated by analyses based on multiple DNA regions. These findings supported the non-monophyly of several taxa relevant to the region (subgenus Anopheles, Laticorn Section, and the Funestus Group) and may indicate the non-monophyly of several South African species [An. coustani Laveran, An. tenebrosus Dönitz, An. parensis Gillies, An. funestus Giles and An. longipalpis C (Theobald) (Type C) (Koekemoer et al. 2009)].

Commercial growers in the southwest use chemical insecticides for the control of the weevil although resistance to dieldrin was suspected as the cause of weevil outbreaks in the mid-1980s. Carborfuran, which replaced dieldrin, has also been reported by some farmers to be ineffective against banana weevil. In this study, banana weevils from three farms in the Masaka District, Uganda, were screened for possible resistance to carbofuran and dieldrin. Test populations of banana weevils were not resistant to carbofuran: LDso values were 3.3-4.5 times higher for males and 1.3-1.7 times higher for females than those for a reference population assumed to be susceptible. This is within the range of normal variability among field populations. Slopes of probit regression lines were steeper for test populations than those of the reference population, while LD99 values were similar among all populations. Two of the test populations had LDso values for dieldrin twice that of the reference population, while the third had an LDso value similar to that of the refer­ ence group. All three test populations had low slope values for mortality, with LD99 values 92 times higher than those of the reference population. There is a strong possibility that banana weevils had developed resistance to dieldrin and that this was the cause of earlier control failures.",

Laboratory and field experiments were carried out on eggs, larvae and adults of this ladybird to determine the effects of three insect growth regulators (IGRs) used against citrus pests in the region. Two chitin synthesis inhibitors, buprofezin and teflubenzuron, and a juvenile hormone analog, pyriproxyfen, were applied to C. nigritus populations at the recommended dosages. Mortality and development of egg and larval stages, as well as mortality and fecundity of the adults were recorded. Laboratory experiments indicated that, of the three IGRs tested, buprofezin was the most detrimental compound, especially to larval stages, irrespective of whether the larvae were fed IGR-treated A. aurantii directly or sprayed with IGRs. Immediate larval mortality from pyriproxyfen and teflubenzuron was not significantly different from the controls. None of the larvae that were fed with IGR-treated A. aurantii pupated. By contrast, larvae that had only been sprayed with IGRs pupated, but no adults emerged. Adult fecundity was not affected by exposure to IGRs, either in the laboratory or in the field, but all eggs exposed to IGRs failed to hatch. Although larvae developed to the adult stage in the field experiments, the IGRs' ovicidal activity and effects on immature stages still had a detrimental effect on C. nigritus population levels. As a result, spraying of IGRs is likely to impede C. nigritus population increases in citrus orchards. This emphasizes the need to avoid spraying during C. nigritus population increases should the use of IGRs be unavoidable. Insect growth regulator's impact on non-target species still requires further consideration, especially with the incorporation of these chemicals into integrated pest management programmes.",

A tree was obtained where the relationships of all mountain areas were resolved according to a hierarchical, time-dependent sequence of vicariance events. It is inferred that most of the present species distributions originated as a consequence of forest fragmentation during the Pleistocene cycles of cooling and drying of the climate. Around 150 000–130 000 years ago, Africa experienced colder, dryer conditions than present conditions. This could have been the first stimulus in the last glacial/interglacial cycle for a large vicariance among different mountain systems. About 130 000 years ago, a warmer, moister phase than the present began, and this condition could have represented an important occasion for the widespread distribution of some genera and species among neighbouring mountain systems. The last glacial maximum confined most species to single refugial montane areas. A resumption of warm, moist conditions probably led up to the Holocene 'optimum' of greater rainforest extent allowing some species to disperse again among adjacent mountain peaks.",

    "abstract": "The African stalk borer, Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is the most significant indigenous pest on sugarcane in South Africa (Atkinson 1980; Conlong 2001). Currently, crop management and cultivar resistance in sugarcane remain the most widely accepted control methods for E. saccharina in South Africa (Nuss & Atkinson 1983; Keeping 2006). Following emergence, E. saccharina larvae graze up and down the sugarcane stalk or disperse onto dead leaf sheaths for several days until old enough and, presumably, with sufficiently strong mandibles to bore into the plant (Leslie 1993). As young larvae use their mandibles to chew through the sugarcane stalk, abrasion of the mandibles’ chewing surface is inevitable and could ultimately reduce feeding efficiency. It is recognized that fertilization with silicon (Si) can enhance the resistance of plants to insect attack, including that of sugarcane to E. saccharina (Keeping & Meyer 2002, 2006; Kvedaras et al. 2007). Testing the effects of this treatment highlighted a need to measure the extent of wear on larval mandibles. While there have been studies that have reported wear of chewing mouthparts of insects, they have either failed to describe the method (Djamin & Pathak 1967), used a method which can only be applied to mandibles of the same size (Raupp 1985) or have not accounted for differences in mandibular size between individuals (Kokko et al. 1993). The objective of this study was to develop an accurate and repeatable method to measure the mandibular wear experienced by E. saccharina larvae fed on commercial sugarcane. It is anticipated that the method will be useful in quantifying mandibular wear in other adult and larval chewing insects. A method is described that uses a simple image analysis technique to determine the loss of feature on the chewing edge of the mandible. Ten third instar E. saccharina larvae were randomly sampled from commercial sugarcane cultivars N26 and N11 grown at the South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI), Mount Edgecombe, KwaZulu-Natal. Larvae were placed directly into 70 % alcohol until required. Prior to analysis, the larvae were removed from the alcohol, allowed to air dry for 10 min and their heads removed under a light microscope. The labrum was removed and using a fine tipped dissecting needle, the mandibles were carefully pried apart to avoid chipping and air-dried for 1 h. The heads were mounted with their mandibles in a horizontal position using black, double-sided carbon tape (12 mm × 20 m, Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, U.S.A.), on standard aluminium scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs. Debris on the mandibles was removed using a fine dissection needle and a fine camel hair brush. The specimens were gold coated for 3.5 min (approx. 6 nanometres thickness) using a gold sputtercoater (Polaron E5100 coating unit and E5500 film thickness moniter, Polaron Equipment Limited, Watford Hertfordshire, U.K.). Specimens were viewed using a scanning electron microscope (Leo 1450 Scanning Electron Microscope, Cambridge, U.S.A.) and the images captured digitally. Each mandible has two scissorial teeth and a proximal tooth, the mola. The degree of wear of a mandible was quantified using an algorithm to obtain a mean square error (MSE), as follows. The (x,y) coordinates (x = horizontal, y = vertical) of the pixels in the digital image that represent the chewing edge of the mandible, from the distal to the proximal convex protrusion (distal scissorial teeth and mola tooth) (Fig. 1), were subjected to linear regression. As the chewing edge of each mandible is carefully orientated under a microscope in a vertical direction, the deviation in the X-axis is the most relevant measurement, hence the best-fitting straight line is calculated as:",

However, the importance of dead wood in tropical forest ecosystems is not yet well understood. The present study investigates saproxylic beetle assemblages of native and exotic standing dead trees (snags). The study was conducted in semi-deciduous protected forest and tree plantations of the Lama Forest Reserve in Benin, West Africa. The snag beetle fauna was sampled for a total of 12 weeks during one year, using trunk window traps. As a control an equal number of live trees was sampled to distinguish saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetles. Mean snag beetle species richness, relative abundance and the number of singletons, species sampled only once, per snag were similar among native and exotic snags. The total number of snag beetle species and beta-diversity of snag beetle assemblages were higher for native than for exotic snags, reflecting high heterogeneity in habitat quality among snags in natural forest. It is concluded that snag beetle assemblages were influenced mainly by the forest system, semi-deciduous forest vs plantations. With regard to dead wood management, retention or creation of snags in semi-deciduous forest, as well as in plantations, can enhance and preserve the diversity of the saproxylic beetle fauna.",

On flight evenings workers open these holes. Large numbers of workers and small numbers of minor soldiers exit the mound to surround the flight holes. Alates then rapidly leave the nest by way of these flight holes. When the last alate has flown workers and soldiers move back into the mound and the flight holes are sealed. Following the flight the females land before the males, selecting elevated sites where they stand head down with wings fully extended. The male seeks out the female and when he joins her, the wings of both are flexed. Following a period of stimulation, both sexes dealate simultaneously and the pair move to the ground to search for a nesting site, moving in tandem with the male following the female. The female chooses the site and initiates digging-in. The male joins in the excavating and together they complete the project.",

    "abstract": "Conservation and management strategies are dependent on reliable species richness information. Accurate species richness counts, especially for invertebrates, are almost impossible to obtain from sampling alone, due to the high costs and effort involved. Therefore, there is a great need to optimize sampling effort to gain maximum information from minimum sampling duration and intensity. Reliable species richness information is particularly critical for under-studied, high diversity regions, such as the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), where biodiversity is threatened by agricultural practices and urbanization. Ants (Formicidae) form an important part of the fauna of the CFR, especially as seed dispersers. This study investigated sampling effort options for maximizing ant species representivity in the region. The specific aims were to determine (i) whether a doubling in the sample duration significantly increased the number of species captured (ii) the effect of increased spatial versus temporal sampling effort on diversity estimates and (iii) the effect of adding an additional trapping method. Sampling was conducted at Elandsberg, Western Cape Province, from 20 February to 1 March 2004. Pitfall trapping was conducted in two five-day sessions and tuna-baits were used once. Species rarefaction curves were drawn and compared using EstimateS. A total of 42 species were captured and asymptotes to species richness were reached. Doubling of sample duration yielded no significant increase in species richness and was equally affected in terms of number of species as was doubling the sampling intensity. However, increasing the number of spatial replicates yielded a higher turnover in species. Baiting added no additional species to pitfall catches. Therefore, when sampling ant diversity in the CFR, investing sampling effort within seasons in spatial replication is likely to be more effective than increasing sampling duration.",

Three entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin, Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson and Isaria fumosorosea Wize were compared in laboratory bioassays employing topical versus per os inoculation techniques. At a dose of 3.75 × 105 conidia per larva, N. rileyi out-performed both I. fumosorosea and B. bassiana, causing a mean of 87 ± 1.4 % mortality. Following treatment of larvae the proportional mortality among larvae and pupae was generally biased towards pupae with (pooled) treatment mean mortalities of 28 ± 8 % vs 56 ± 18 %, respectively. Notably, no difference was detected between the two inoculation techniques employed with any of the three fungal species assayed. The incubation periods for topical applications ranged from 4 days (PPRI 7201 and 8072) to 7 days (PPRI 7758) while per os treatments responded on Day 4 (PPRI 8072) and Day 5 (PPRI 7758 and 7201) post-inoculation. A general trend of accelerated pupation following treatment with N. rileyi was noted with both inoculation techniques. A novel per os inoculation substrate was tested that ensured more accurate dose acquisition and performance quantification. Compared to the other fungi, superior performance by N. rileyi underscores the potential of this species for development as a myco-insecticide against H. armigera.",

To help develop a strategy to manage this pest and associated viruses in three vegetable crops in the Egyptian agricultural system, experiments on several cultural techniques were conducted. Cultural practices of mulching with white polyethylene, intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.), and crop rotation with maize resulted in reduced whitefly populations and reduced incidences of viruses in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). However, no benefit in whitefly abundance and virus incidence was obtained from modifying the planting time by one month earlier than standard planting. There was a high correlation between whitefly abundance and virus incidence. Based on viral symptoms, up to 75 % infection was observed in untreated plots, while most of the treated plots had less than 40 % infection. The viruses affecting the crops were Cucumber vein yellowing virus in cucumber, Squash leaf curl virus in squash, and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus in tomato; they are common problems in Egypt. The first-mentioned virus is caused by an Ipomovirus in the family Potyviridae while the other two are Begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae. The cultural management strategies utilized in this study are viable tools to help manage B. tabaci and associated viruses in vegetable crops.",

We studied the effect of the two alien taxa, tree and ant, on various species of indigenous ants. Alien trees significantly influenced abundance and species richness of local ant assemblages, as a result of the dense alien tree canopy changing environmental conditions of the ants' habitat. The Argentine ant displaced Pheidole capensis and certain Camponotus spp., and reduced abundance of other indigenous ants such as Lepisiota capensis and Plagiolepis spp. Displacement by the Argentine ant appears to arise from indirect competition for food resources. The effects of alien trees and the alien ant are synergistic, both positively and negatively, depending on the particular indigenous ant species in question. Thus the changes in the indigenous ant assemblage wrought by alien trees are further influenced by the presence of the alien ant. Removal of the alien trees disadvantages the Argentine ant and reverses the adverse synergism as a result of more sunlit natural conditions. We caution against the use of the word ‘synergistic’ to focus on particular species and interactions rather than being used as an umbrella term for general impact and threat to faunal assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Pachycondyla analis Latreille (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is a common African Ponerine ant that organizes group raids on termites considered a huge burden to agriculture. This ant has been the subject of various entomological and natural history studies aimed at understanding their group raiding behaviour and impact on the ecosystem as well as the roles they play in regulating field termite populations. However, colony maintenance under laboratory conditions for long-term research purposes has largely been unsuccessful. Herein, we report an effective method for maintaining P. analis in the laboratory for long-term studies that may include behavioural, life history and chemical ecology. Using a simple set-up made up of a Perspex foraging arena and an aluminum nest box in the laboratory, queen right colonies were successfully maintained for an average of 27.0 ± 6.0 weeks and a maximum of 34 weeks before declining. High ant mortality (6–48 %) was observed in the first week of captivity in the laboratory. This declined to a weekly mortality of 4.0 ± 3.6 % (24 ± 22.5 ants per colony) after the ants had settled in their new laboratory nest. Therefore, using our laboratory rearing set-up, and keeping laboratory conditions similar to those in the field, as well as feeding P. analis on its usual diet of termites, could increase colony survival time up to 4.5 times longer than previously reported rearing protocols.",

    "abstract": "Eucalyptus species are indigenous to Australia but arenowgrown worldwide due to their fast growth rate and various uses as timber and fuel wood. Insect pests of Eucalyptus have since followed their host and, in most cases, leaving behind the natural enemies which usually regulate them below economic injury. This is the case with Glycaspis brimblecombei and Leptocybe invasa which are now resident in most parts of the world including Zimbabwe. Damage as a result of the two pests currently poses a threat to reforestation efforts to provide alternative sources of firewood for curing tobacco. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of the two pests as well as assess the possibility of managing L. invasa through biological control by releasing and recovering successive generations of the natural enemy Selitrichodes neseri in selected L. invasa-infested areas. Surveys were therefore carried out in Zimbabwe and GPS coordinates for pest presence recorded and used to determine the current distribution and future projections of the two pests using Maximum Entropy (maxent) ecological niche modelling. In preliminary studies to manage L. invasa, the natural wasp enemy S. neseri was released in Eucalyptus plantations and recovery studies done to establish their perpetuation in the field. Based on temperature and precipitation averages for Zimbabwe, the model predicted widespread distribution of the two pests especially in Mashonaland West, Bulawayo, Harare, Midlands province and parts of Manicaland province. This predicted range was projected to shrink due to climate change by the year 2055. In terms of relative contribution in predicting the distribution of the occurrence data, the three most important variables were mean annual temperature (39 %), mean temperature coolest month (18.3%)and annual moisture index (18 %). The performance of the model was high, with an AUC value of 0.884. Selitrichodes neseri wasps were recovered in infested Eucalyptus samples 4–6 generations after the initial release, indicating a high possibility of the natural enemy being able to establish in the future. Our findings are therefore important in understanding the current and projected distribution of both L. invasa and G. brimblecombei in Zimbabwe and formulating management measures for the two pests.",

    "abstract": "Bradysia spp. are major pests of undercover crops, to which they can cause considerable economic loss. The use of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) for the control of Bradysia spp. has proven to be relatively advantageous, since sciarids are mostly pests of undercover crops that have a short lifecycle, or for which the application of pesticides is unsuitable. In this study, eight South African local EPN species and a non-native EPN species, namely Steinernema feltiae, were tested for their ability to kill Bradysia impatiens larvae at different temperatures. The results showed four local EPN species, Steinernema yirgalemense, Heterorhabditis noenieputensis, Heterorhabditis indica and Heterorhabditis zealandica, achieving higher than 80 % mortality, at 25 °C and 30 °C, from the different bioassays performed. Heterorhabditis zealandica had the lowest LD50 of 2.60 infective juveniles (IJs) per larva and LD90 of 18.68 IJs/larva. Steinernema yirgalemense had an LD50 of 8.98 and an LD90 of 64.16, which were similar to those of H. indica. Steinernema yirgalemense, H. indica and H. zealandica were all able to reproduce inside the fourth-instar larvae of B. impatiens, and to produce IJs. The relatively larger nematodes, Steinernema jeffreyense, Steinernema khoisanae, and Steinernema litchii were unable to infect the fourth-instar larvae of B. impatiens, which indicated that the size of the EPNs affected their ability to infect fungus gnat larvae. This study demonstrated the high potential for the use of locally isolated EPNs for the control of fungus gnats in South Africa.",

The optimal application of essential oils has not yet been investigated. One key factor to consider would be the practical considerations of cowpea storage, such as quantity of seeds and type of storage container. For this purpose, we tested the efficacy of essential oils extracted from four native plants in controlling Callosobruchus maculatus, the major pest of stored cowpeas. First, we evaluated Callosobruchus maculatus mortality rate in relation with increasing amount of cowpeas. Then, experiments were conducted with essential oil in two different materials: plastic and aluminium in order to determine the weevil perforation index, the intrinsic rate of natural increase and the rate of cowpea germination. In fine, aromatized powder mixed with cowpea seeds are used against Callosobruchus maculatus by evaluating the mortality rate. The quantity of seeds influenced the efficacy of pure Lippia multiflora and Hyptis spicigera essential oils, whereas essential oils from Ocimum americanum and Hyptis suaveolens were not affected by stock size. The type of storage device used influenced the effectiveness of essential oils tested, plastic containers being more suitable than aluminium ones. Ocimum americanum used as contact insecticide in different aromatized powders exhibited variable toxic effects on C. maculatus.We conclude that essential oils appear to be safe alternatives to insecticides for long-duration storage of cowpeas.",

Adults laid batches of up to 15 eggs, usually on the abaxial sides of L. major leaves. The larvae mined internally, leaving the epidermal tissues of the upper and lower leaves intact. The larvae underwent three instars which took an average of 24 days and pupated within the leaf tissue, from which the adults emerged.

Here, we perform a case study to assess the effect of habitat quality and fragmentation on the morphology of a large, mobile, generalist insect herbivore, the bird locust, Ornithacris cyanea (Orthoptera: Acrididae). Four isolated, semi-natural grassland fragments within an exotic timber plantation matrix were ranked in terms of their habitat quality on the basis of vegetation surveys, management actions, and habitat context surrounding the fragments. Mark-release-recapture was used to estimate bird locust population size. Bird locusts from each fragment were measured for nine morphological characters: four length characters and five asymmetry and phenodeviation characters expected to be indicative of developmental instability. The highest density of individuals was found in an intermediate-quality fragment. Individuals from the poorest quality fragment had significantly shorter hind femurs than those from the best-quality fragment. Females from the poorest quality fragment also had significantly shorter forewings and more forewing pattern phenodeviation than females from other fragments. Morphological differences among the four populations indicated that they were distinct and that the population at the poorest quality site displayed adaptation for reduced mobility and increased developmental instability. Although we cannot determine whether populations were distinct due to inherent preferences of the species or as a result of reduced movement because of the inhospitable matrix, the correlation of morphological differences with habitat quality indicates that even highly mobile, generalist species can undergo rapid adaptations within isolated fragments and in response to varying habitat quality.",

    "abstract": "Physical aspects of macadamia orchards appear to play an important role in the distribution patterns of indigenous heteropterans. Increasing tree density and tree height appear to be associated with increases in insect damage. Very dense orchards not only provide these insects with an ideal sheltered habitat, it also reduces the efficacy of many air-assisted sprayers commonly used for insect control in this crop. Macadamias are very tall trees and heteropterans seem to have a preference for nuts occurring in the higher tree strata. The reason for this is unclear at the moment but it might be related to thermoregulation or lekking behaviour. Heteroptera damage was also confined to the edges of many orchards especially during the early season and it is speculated that perimeter trees may temporarily act as a barrier, preventing migration deeper into the orchards. Implications of these findings for an IPM programme are discussed and include: perimeter spraying during the early season as opposed to a full cover spray, tree pruning as well as tree height management.",

Spodoptera exigua is a freeze avoidance insect, which can overwinter as third instar larvae in China. Our previous study illustrated that seasonal and diel fluctuating temperatures enhanced its cold hardening. The survival mechanism for this stage, however, is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the survival mechanisms in third instar larvae of S. exigua were correlated with the induction of cryoprotectants and/or expression of hsps. Results showed that trehalose as the main cryoprotectant was accumulated during the cold acclimation (CA), and the level of accumulation fell off sharply when the CA treatment was discontinued (discontinued cold acclimation, DCA). Furthermore, inducible hsp90 was down-regulated in all treatments compared with the control, and hsp70 was up-regulated under conditions of CA and RCH (rapid cold hardening), which induced 1.23- and 44.00-fold increases compared with the control. Therefore, we considered that both trehalose (as the main cryoprotectant) and hsps (i.e. hsp90 and hsp70) were involved in the regulation of physiological activity of third instar larvae of S. exigua to resist low temperatures during winter. These results are helpful for us to understand the mechanisms underlying this species' ecological adaptability and stress tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is an important polyphagous, cosmopolitan insect pest of fruit crops, including apples, pears and grapes. The mealybug negatively affects fruit production both in South Africa and globally by feeding on phloem sap, excreting large amounts of sugar and water as a carbohydrate-rich sugary substance, known as honeydew, onto the leaves and fruit. Honeydew causes severe secondary damage, as it promotes the growth of sooty mould, which decreases the amount of photosynthesis, thus affecting the development of the host plant. Fruit consignments with fruits stained with sooty mould or suspected of containing live or dead mealybugs are rejected when exported, due to the strict phytosanitary standards. Managing mealybugs in agroecosystems is difficult, due to their small body size and cryptic nature. Currently, control relies on the use of chemicals and, to some extent, on biological control. However, using such methods has proven to be ineffective in the management of P. viburni. Entomopathogens, such as entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) and entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), have been used across agricultural production areas to control a wide range of agricultural pest insects. The current review provides an overview of the biology and control of P. viburni, with special reference to biological control using EPF and EPNs in South African orchards, in an integrated pest management system.",

    "abstract": "Several weed species within the asteraceous tribe Eupatorieae, all with a neotropical origin, are invasive in South Africa. Three of these form the subject of this review paper: Chromolaena odorata (triffid weed), Campuloclinium macrocephalum (pompom weed), and Ageratina adenophora (crofton weed). The three species invade different habitats and regions, and all have biological control (biocontrol) agents established on them. Ageratina adenophora was the first of these weeds to be subjected to a biocontrol programme in South Africa, with two agents (an insect and a pathogen) released and established in the 1980s. Two biocontrol agents were established on C. odorata in the early 2000s, and a third one, first released in 2011, has persisted for at least eight years – all three are insects. One insect biocontrol agent was established on C. macrocephalum in 2013, although a pathogen had appeared on the weed several years earlier. Chromolaena odorata and A. adenophora are under substantial control in certain habitats, but negligible in others. The biocontrol agent on C. macrocephalum released in 2013 is causing significant damage to the plant where it has established well. Several other biocontrol agents have been released on C. odorata but have failed to establish. For all three weedy Eupatorieae, it is considered desirable to establish additional biocontrol agents, so as to increase the level of control of these priority targets in South Africa. An additional biocontrol agent has already been approved for release against C. macrocephalum, while one is close to being approved for C. odorata. There are several possibilities for additional biocontrol agents for A. adenophora.",

    "abstract": "South Africa supports a rich floral diversity, with 21 643 native plant taxa that include a high proportion (76.3%) of endemic species, and many of these favoured as ornamentals, both locally and globally. Consequently, South Africa has contributed substantially to global plant invasions, with 1093 native taxa (5% of all species) naturalized in other countries. At least 80 taxa are invasive in natural or semi-natural ecosystems elsewhere, while an additional 132 taxa are potentially invasive. Of the global naturalized flora, 8.2% originate from South Africa and largely comprise species of Poaceae, Asteraceae, Iridaceae and Fabaceae. Australia, in particular, but also Europe and North America are major recipients of South African weeds. However, few countries have targeted South African plants for biological control (biocontrol), with most efforts undertaken by Australia. Previous and current targets have involved only 26 species with 17 agents (15 insects, one mite and one rust fungus) of South African origin released on five target species in Australia and the United States of America. South Africa's history of weed biocontrol, together with a large cohort of active scientists, is currently facilitating several internationally funded programmes targeting invasive plants of South African origin. In particular, the recently inaugurated Centre for Biological Control at Rhodes University and the University of KwaZulu-Natal have provided the impetus for novel efforts on five new target species and renewed efforts on four previously targeted species. In this contribution, we review the history of earlier biocontrol programmes against weeds of South African origin and the status of projects currently in progress in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Food quality has a profound impact on various life history traits, including life span, development time and resistance to infections. In the current study, we used isofemale lines originated from African and European populations that cover a broad range of performances regarding different life history traits. These isofemale lines showed very different survival rates even on standard medium, which is indicative of a significant impact of the genotype on their overall performance. It was hypothesised that different nutritive yeast species influence life history traits. Thus, we used two different yeast species that are usually associated with Drosophila and that may function as major food sources under natural conditions. Adding either yeast species Pichia toletana or Metschnikowia pulcherrima as a food source, increased survival rate and decreased development time; P. toletana was more effective than M. pulcherrima. This difference was also reflected in a behavioural choice assay showing that P. toletana was more attractive than M. pulcherrima. Pichia toletana had not only positive effects on the different life history traits under control conditions, but it also increased the resistance to infection with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri. Confrontation with either yeast species induced expression of the antimicrobial peptide gene drosomycin. The expression pattern of this antimicrobial peptide was similar to what is observed after stress-induced activation of the immune system rather than that observed after conventional infection with a pathogen. The results presented in this study support the hypothesis that different nutritive yeast species affect Drosophila survival rate, decrease development time and increase resistance to infection. This study provides evidence that the fitness of Drosophila critically depends on the fly's genotype as well as the nutritive yeasts.",

About 350 bp of the 16S ribosomalRNAgene was amplified from genomicDNAextracted from each ‘pseudospecies', sequenced, and bacteria identified using BLASTn. Nineteen different types of colony were identified from M. domestica, with Pseudomonas sp. and Swine Manure Bacterium SP14 being most abundant. Chrysomya megacephala yielded 15 distinct pseudospecies with total colony counts approximating to 10 000 from 10 plates, where 80 % of colonies were non-pathogenic Bacillus pumilus. A total of 18 species were identified genetically: three shared by the fly species; four unique to C. megacephala, and 13 unique to M. domestica. Half of these 18 species were pathogenic, two or three others were food spoilers and the rest were environmental or commensal bacteria from soil or plant matter. This study added three new pathogenic strains of bacteria and one new environmental strain to the list of bacteria reported to be vectored by these flies.",

Research in the UK has identified Beauveria bassiana, IMI 389521 as a suitable control agent for grain storage pests in the UK. The pathogenicity of B. bassiana, IMI 389521 was evaluated against adult P. truncatus, S. zeamais and Teretrius nigrescens in Ghana. Fifty adults of each insect species were treated with 0.5 g dry conidia powder of this isolate at 8.65 × 108 conidia/g for 1 minute and mortality recorded daily for 14 days. The results indicated that B. bassiana, is pathogenic against P. truncatus and S. zeamais, inducing over 90% mortality by day 7. Teretrius nigrescens was, however less susceptible to the fungus with 30% mortality. To determine the most effective concentration of B. bassiana for the control of P. truncatus, a laboratory dose response experiment using four concentrations of B. bassiana (108–1011 cfu/kg maize) was also conducted. Maize grains (250 g) in separate jars were treated with the four concentrations of the product. Fifty adults of P. truncatus were placed into the jars containing the treated maize and mortality was assessed weekly for 3 weeks. The most effective dose was 1010 cfu/kg maize, which resulted in 96% and 100% mortality of P. truncatus after 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. This study shows that B. bassiana could effectively be integrated into bio-control programme of these two key pests of maize in Ghana after further field trials.",

To date, limited information regarding the seasonal phenology of this pest species on the islands limits the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) programmes. As part of a coffee farmer training programme, three attractants were evaluated in red vs. transparent traps to assess olfactory and visual stimuli. The experiment was delineated in a split-block design with three types of attractants: commercial ethanol + 40 g of ripe Robusta coffee (A1), proportion 3:1 methanol and ethanol (A2), and commercial ethanol + 10 g of ground roasted Arabica coffee (A3); and two home-made transparent (D1) and red (D2) traps. The results showed that there was significant interaction between the trap model and the attractant for borer capture. The transparent trap baited with methanol and ethanol exhibited the best result with an average of 14.3 ± 5.4 adults/trap/week. Transparent traps baited captured more borers and largest numbers of beetles were trapped late May through September. In short, home-made traps alone are not effective for controlling the coffee berry borer, but they are useful in monitoring this species.",

A total of 11 083 fruits were collected and inspected for coconut bug damage. A total of 5 262 fruits were found to be damaged by coconut bugs. The results of the predicted percentage means from the GLMM modelling of the damage caused by the coconut bugs ranged from 19.71% to 62.41% on aborted fruit from farms, with 33.77% and 57.53% in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, respectively. An indication that the coconut bug caused an average annual loss of 45.65% on immature fruit that were subsequently aborted in production from the two provinces. These findings point towards the fact that there is a considerable presence of coconut bug on the farms and also that litchi is a very good host of the coconut bug. The coconut bug damage increased when other host plants are cultivated in close proximity. Further research to evaluate economic impact of this pest is therefore needed.",

    "abstract": "Exotic crop production negatively affects native biodiversity and alters ecosystem functions and services. Cultivation of indigenous crops can mediate some biodiversity impacts, as these are often less intensively managed than exotic crops and they provide familiar niches for native organisms. Protea (Proteaceae), a floricultural crop with high economic value and ecological significance, is harvested within both natural and cultivated systems in South Africa. A multitude of organisms are intimately involved in Protea ecology, but many are also pests and pose significant phytosanitary risks. Here we evaluated the impact of Protea cultivation on the diversity of mites associated with inflorescences, infructescences, and the rhizosphere in the Greater Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot of South Africa. Natural sites harboured higher mite diversity than cultivated sites, although this was only significant for those mites associated with the rhizosphere or when Protea crops were intensively managed. Mite community assemblage composition differed between different management types, localities, and niches. Management actions had little effect on mite assemblage composition in inflorescences and infructescences, likely due to continuous long-distance colonisation from natural areas via pollinators. In contrast, mite assemblages associated with the rhizosphere were highly impacted in all cultivated sites. These results indicate that indigenous crops can sustain substantial above-ground native mite biodiversity, but ecologically important soil assemblages may be severely impacted. Current field-based management strategies are not effective in controlling mite assemblages within Protea inflorescences, posing significant phytosanitary risks.",

During adult choice tests, C. hirta did not discriminate between S. americanum and S. dasyphyllum, but avoided S. lycopersicum. These differences in host-plant suitability may relate, in part, to the presence of glandular leaf trichomes, renowned anti-herbivore defences, on S. viarum and S. lycopersicum, but not on S. americanum or S. dasyphyllum. Since C. hirta, a broadly oligophagous herbivore within the native Solanum insect community, cannot exploit S. viarum, the plant may well expand its range in South Africa due to an escape from insect herbivory.",

The analysis involved model fitting to frequency distributions of head capsule measurements of laboratory-reared and field-collected larvae. The laboratory population revealed developmental polymorphism, with larvae passing through 5-7 instars. The model fitted Gaussian curves with five peaks for laboratory samples and six peaks for field samples. Mean head capsule widths for the first four instars showed close agreement among both laboratory and field-collected populations. Variability appeared greater among field populations, resulting in a higher probability of misidentification. The method of analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to separate later instars. Plotting mean head-capsule widths against instar number showed a geometric curve to be the best fit, but with only approximate conformity to Dyar's rule. The duration of banana weevil immature stages was determined under ambient conditions in three experiments. Most eggs hatched within 5.5--8.0 days. Using a developmental threshold of 12C, thermal requirements (92.8-95.9 degree-days) appeared similar to those established for a West African population.

    "abstract": "In southern Africa, two indigenous silk moth species, Gonometa postica and G. rufobrunnea (Lepidoptera : Lasiocampidae), produce commercial-quality silk with fibre that rivals that of the domesticated silkworm and thus has potential for commercial utilization. Although extensive harvesting of cocoons is taking place, little is known of the biology of these two species, including the frequency distribution of cocoon and adult sizes. In both species the sexes differ in size, but the extent of these differences has never been formally quantified. Female cocoons are approximately twice as large as male cocoons, and yield more silk fibre. Thus, sex ratios in natural populations will be important when harvesting cocoons. Our aim was to determine if there are differences in sex-specific cocoon size between : the species; host-plant-specific populations; localities within their distribution range; and between first- and second-generation pupae. The sex ratio and frequency of dwarfism in populations were also determined. Both Gonometa species were significantly sexually dimorphic in cocoon length, width and shape and they could be sexed based on size and shape. Cocoon length was a suitable alternative measure to occupied cocoon mass, and may be used as a rough estimate of silk yield. The sex ratio of both species was approximately 1 : 1 and did not differ consistently between generations. Dwarfs were only found in G. postica populations. Cocoon sizes differed significantly between species, the sexes and localities, but not between generations and host-plant-specific populations. The variability in cocoon sizes found at localities would have implications for silk yields, but sex and species are by far the most important determinants of cocoon size. This information will form the basis of a sustainable harvesting programme for Gonometa spp. in southern Africa.",

Members of the An. gambiae complex were distinguished from other anopheline species using morphological keys and were subsequently specifically identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 5084 anophelines were collected during the survey, of which 2837 (55.8 %) were Anopheles coustani Laveran, 1418 (27.9 %) were members of the Anopheles funestus group, 435 (8.6 %) were members of the An. gambiae complex, 264 (5.2 %) were Anopheles pretoriensis Theobald, and 130 (2.6 %) comprised nine other anopheline species. From a total of 425 PCR identifications of adult females of the An. Gambiae complex, 238 (56.0 %) were Anopheles merus Donitz, 129 (30.4 %) Anopheles quadriannulatus Theobald and 58 (13.6 %) were Anopheles arabiensis Patton. No circumsporozoite antigen for Plasmodium falciparum was detected in any of the female An. gambiae complex mosquitoes. Monthly An. gumbiae s.l. captures were significantly correlated with rainfall but there was no correlation between mosquitoes captures and monthly malaria notifications. Malaria notifications were, however, strongly associated with mean daily temperatures. The peak in malaria incidence paralleled the peak in rainfall with a time lag of 2-3 months. This study provides updated information on the distribution of the An. gambiae complex in Mpumalanga Province's Lowveld Region, notably the incidence of mosquitoes biting humans outside sprayed houses between 18:00 and 22:00. The study also provides the first documented evidence of large numbers of An. merus feeding on humans in Mpumalanga. Further analysis of rainfall and temperature patterns may facilitate the prediction of malaria epidemics with sufficient lead-time to enable the Provincial Malaria Control Programme to launch pre-emptive control measures.",

Modifications include a multivariate capability that facilitates the incorporation of precipitation seasonality, and provides useful output in the form of probability of occurrence values for each species. The model can be used to interpolate the distributions of poorly sampled taxa as well as predict responses to a changing climate. It is predicted that species from the more arid western parts of South Africa will be subject to severe range contraction and range shifts whereas the species from the more mesic eastern parts will experience range contraction with limited range shift. The likelihood of successful range shifts will be affected by the nature of novel communities, habitat suitability and the degree of land transformation. Given the extent of the predicted spatial responses, conservation planners can no longer afford to ignore future climate impacts on species distribution patterns.",

South African Odonata species have received considerable conservation focus and have been used to test the most recent IUCN categories and criteria of threat. The importance of overcoming both the taxonomic and perception challenges in invertebrate conservation are discussed. The categorization process is also discussed. Recommendations for South African national redlisting are made, with special reference to the dynamics of such red-listing. A simplified strategy is finally presented, which includes a suggestion for compiling a list of potential focal taxa which in the first instance are not categorized. The species on this list then become a core in field searches, both during wide-scale atlassing and during more focussed threat category assessments.",

During the 2002/03 season relatively high numbers of Euseius addoensis, a local specialist pollen feeder/generalist predator, were also recorded. While N. californicus has been present, population levels of the phytophagous mites, Tetranychus urticae and Panonychus ulmi, have declined steadily. N. californicus usually appeared when there were between two and four phytophagous mites per leaf. However, during the 2001/02 and 2002/03 seasons, it was recorded before the phytophagous mites appeared. The population peak of phytophagous mites usually varied between an average of two to 13 mites per leaf, while during the 2001/02 and 2002/03 seasons the phytophagous mite population peaked at less than one mite/leaf. Prior to the appearance of N. californicus, apple orchards in the Elgin area received at least one acaricide spray per season. Acaricides are no longer used on apples. A benefit-cost analysis was conducted in the Elgin district, where there are approximately 8000 ha bearing apples. Two scenarios were analysed. In the first, the cost of acaricides was fixed during each year at R60.00/ha. In the second, the 1993 price of an acaricide was set at R250.00 and was escalated using index values for sprays and dips. In the first scenario the benefit-cost ratio was 34, 52 and 69 for a reduction of 1, 1.5 and 2 acaricides per season, respectively. In the second scenario it was 189, 284 and 378 for the same season.",

Introduced as beneficial plants to India, Pakistan, South Africa, Egypt, Kuwait, Australia, U.S.A. (Hawaii), and Brazil, some Prosopis species have become invasive in some of these countries. Mechanical and chemical control methods implemented in the U.S.A., Australia and South Africa have been only marginally effective. In an attempt to preserve the beneficial attributes of mesquite while arresting its spread, biocontrol efforts in South Africa have only focused on seed-feeding agents. Between 1987 and 1993, three species of bruchids were introduced from the U.S.A., but their impact has been limited as ripe pods are eaten by livestock before the agents have had a chance to eat the seeds. In this paper we present a list of insects that attack the reproductive structures of Prosopis species in Argentina, focusing on those that feed on green, unripe pods and flower buds. We provide information on the biology, distribution and host range of nine beetles, four moths and one gall midge species. Their potential as biological control agents against mesquite in South Africa is discussed with special reference to that of a new weevil species, Coelocephalapion gandolfoi Kissinger which was selected for further studies. The adults feed and oviposit on green pods, while the larvae feed on the immature seeds, apparently without causing a substantial reduction in the value of pods as fodder.",

Macrotermes natalensis (Haviland) produced a single brood of alates each year. These alates left their parent nests in dispersal flights early in the summer rainy season from late September to early December, with a peak during October. Rainfall was the primary stimulatory factor triggering flight; 5 mm was the threshold for initial flights. Large flights usually occurred later in the season and required more rain to trigger them. The initiation and duration of individual flights were regulated by factors such as temperature, light intensity, and wind. The threshold temperature for swarming flights lay between 17–19°C. If the air temperature dropped below this the flight was aborted. The species did not fly during rain and major flights took place between 39 % and 90 % relative humidity. Windless conditions were favoured for flight which ensured that alates were not distributed so widely that the chances of finding a mate were jeopardized and that the female sex pheromone was not so dispersed that males failed to locate mates. Flight times varied over the flight season as they were governed by light intensity and took place at dusk in low light intensities with alates leaving the nest from 1 to 30 lux. The majority of swarming flights occurred with a waxing moon.",

The flowerbud-feeding weevil, Anthonomus santacruzi Hustache (Curculionidae), was proposed for release in South Africa in 2003, based on host records and observations in its native range and on four years of host-specificity testing in quarantine in South Africa (Olckers 2003). During the review process, the South African cotton industry expressed concerns about possible risks posed by the weevil to cotton production (S.W. Broodryk, pers. comm.). This was because a related species, Anthonomus grandis Boheman (boll weevil), constitutes a major pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., (Malvaceae), in the Americas, but does not occur in South Africa and thus has a high quarantine priority. Earlier host-specificity tests were focussed on plants in the family Solanaceae and did not include cotton, since A. santacruzi and A. grandis are reportedly restricted to host plants in the families Solanaceae and Malvaceae, respectively (Cross et al. 1975; Clark & Burke 1996). As a precaution, the cotton industry requested that two non-transgenic cultivars (i.e. susceptible to insect pests in general) be tested to confirm that the crop is not susceptible to A. santacruzi. This paper discusses the results of these additional trials and their implications for the release of A. santacruzi in South Africa.",

These trees grow naturally on the black cotton soils of the Laikipia ecosystem, accounting for more than 98 % of the overstorey at the study site, and are important for local cattle and wildlife production. The ultimate objective of this study was to determine the effect of differential grazing and browsing pressure from large mammalian herbivores on the beetle communities of A. drepanolobium. Seven hundred and twenty trees 1.0–2.5 m tall were sampled using each method, making a total of 1440 trees. Sampling using the two methods was done concurrently and repeated quarterly over a period of 14 months. In total, 4320 individuals were collected, 1456 by beating and 2864 by fogging. The methods jointly yielded beetle specimens from 13 families and 55 morphospecies. Fogging collected significantly more beetle morphospecies than beating, and there was a significant interaction effect between method and sampling date.

    "abstract": "Cashew, Anacardium occidentale L. is an important export crop in Benin, but incurs serious damage from the cashew wood borer Apate terebrans Pallas. In spite of its economic importance, the population dynamics of this beetle have never been studied, thus precluding any science-based development and implementation of control strategies. The spatial and temporal abundance pattern of A.terebrans was therefore monitored in 17 mature cashew orchards distributed across three agro-ecological zones in Benin. In each orchard, 30 cashew trees were chosen at random and inspected monthly for two consecutive years. As this insect feeds inside branches and trunks by boring holes, direct observations of adults inside the tree are not possible. Therefore infestations of trees were estimated by the occurrence and number of fresh entry holes. Over the two-year observation period, infestations in the cashew trees by A.terebrans started in September, peaked in January–February and sharply declined thereafter, reaching zero by July–August. Whereas the infestation rates were statistically similar between sampling years or among agro-ecological zones, they differed significantly among sampling months. Aggregation indices calculated using Taylor's power law indicated that A.terebrans has an aggregated spatial distribution. Values of the Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) index indicated that the spatial pattern of the infestation in a given year does not depend on the pattern observed in the previous years, suggesting that A.terebrans generally prefers to infest new trees. Implications of our findings for the development, implementation and monitoring of effective control strategies against A.terebrans are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Growth and development of insects in the laboratory cultures can be significantly enhanced by improving the nutrient quality of their culturing medium. One way to achieve this is by including add-ons in the food medium. This approach is commonly followed in culturing red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) which is used as a model insect for a variety of laboratory studies. Commonly yeast is used as a food admixture for escalating beetle production and promoting oviposition. In this study, we aim to evaluate some alternates for yeast, i.e. agar-agar and folic acid at three levels (3.33 %, 6.66%and 10 %) for enhancing laboratory culturing of T. castaneum. The results demonstrated that highest adult production was achieved by adding yeast at the rate of 6.66%(279±23.24) to the food medium while agar-agar and folic acid produced more adults albeit with prolonged larval duration of about 5 days as compared to yeast when ad-mixed at rates of 10%(196.6±21.52) and 3.33%(164.8±3.51). The experiment confirms yeast as a best add-on for enhancing the T. castaneum population but agar-agar and folic acid could be used as substitute when the cultures are required to be maintained vitally without fast developments, for maintaining master cultures in the laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Cucurbits are among the most valuable food crops in various developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The development of integrated strategies in their pest management is limited by lack of information on fruit losses, especially by tephritids and their pest status on crops. Thus, based on fruit damage rates and infestation rates, cucurbits' susceptibility to tephritids was assessed in Yaoundé and Koutaba, two localities situated in different agroecological zones in Southern Cameroon. From systematic samplings in trap plots, 6009 damaged fruits from nine cucurbit species were collected weekly and bimonthly and incubated during 2009–2011. Fruit losses, which were evaluated at 36.73±1.90%atYaoundé and 37.08 ± 3.22 % at Koutaba, did not vary in relation to locality. Losses due to tephritids were more important on Sechium edule and Cucurbita moschata at Yaoundé and on S. edule, Citrullus lanatus (watermelon), Cucumis melo (sweet melon), Cucumis sativus and Cucurbita moschata at Koutaba. At each site, Cucumis melo var. agrestis was the less susceptible species. With the exception of S. edule, developing fruits were more susceptible to tephritids as 80% of positive fruits weighed less than 100 g. Moreover, four tephritids emerged from fruits; Dacus bivittatus and Dacus ciliatus appeared to be the major pests and Dacus vertebratus a minor pest. Pest status of Dacus punctatifrons depends on border plants. Also, D. ciliatus exhibited preference for Cucurbita moschata and D. bivittatus for S. edule and Cucumeropsis mannii. Our findings provide useful data for the conception of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies against tephritids.",

Bathycoelia distincta Distant (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) was the dominant heteropteran and occurred during all four phenological stages of the host plant that were monitored. However, abundance levels of this pest decreased during winter when fewer nuts were available. This decrease was immediately accompanied by a concomitant increase in the relative abundance levels of lesser important heteropterans. B. distincta, Pseudatelus raptorius (Germar) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and Pseudotheraptus wayi Brown (Hemiptera: Coreidae) were the only heteropterans able to reproduce in macadamias which further strengthened the hypothesis of seasonal resource-based competition by the dominant species. All heteropterans recovered from these surveys can be categorised into two major groups namely: a group with a fairly large body size and long mouthparts which is able to reproduce successfully in macadamias and which occur mainly when nuts are available, as well as a group with smaller body size, shorter mouthparts, which cannot reproduce in this crop and which is only abundant when there are no or few nuts available on the trees.",

Here, we show that nest sites and nest architecture can be used to discriminate three Hypotrigona species found in Kenya. Hypotrigona gribodoi, H. araujoi and H. ruspolii colonies from Kakamega forest and H. gribodoi from Mwingi, were collected and placed in a meliponiary at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE). The following parameters were recorded: nest sites, internal nest entrances, external nest entrance colour and size, sizes (in terms of volume) of brood cells, honey and pollen pots, arrangement of brood cells and presence or absence of involucrum (cerumen covering brood). It was found that nest sites are specific to species. Hypotrigona gribodoi nests mostly in crevices in mud walls while H. ruspolii and H. araujoi nest in cavities in specific tree species, mainly in indigenous forests. The colour of external nest entrances varies between the species. H. araujoi's is yellowish brown, H. gribodoi's is white or cream while that of H. ruspolii is dark brown. There is an internal nest entrance in H. gribodoi, which is absent in the other two Hypotrigona species. Brood cells are clustered in H. gribodoi and H. ruspolii whereas H. araujo's form vertical semi comb-like layers. The area of the apical opening of the entrance tube and volumes of brood cells, honey and pollen pots differ significantly between the three Hypotrigona species. Therefore, nest sites and nest architecture can be used to discriminate three Hypotrigona species. Furthermore, the study indicates that conservation of indigenous forests, the main habitat for H. araujoi and H. ruspolii is important for their conservation.",

    "abstract": "The banded fruit weevil (BFW), Phlyctinus callosus (Schönherr) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a polyphagous pest, feeding on a number of plant groups, like grasses, weeds, herbs, and woody plants. Phlyctinus callosus is indigenous to South Africa and has a limited distribution throughout the world. The weevil was only reported in the Western Cape, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Where the BFW occurs, it is a major insect pest of grapes and deciduous fruit, causing damage by feeding on the leaves and fruit, including the fruit stalks and shoots. The BFW adults, especially, cause fruit damage by means of feeding on the skin and the underlying flesh, which results in the formation of shallow lesions with phytosanitary implications. Other damage includes foliage damage, berry scarring and ringbarked stems, due to feeding activity. Control has mainly been achieved through the use of trunk barriers, which are effective in preventing the weevil from reaching the fruits, although such use is labour-intensive. Biocontrol agents, like entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), are preferred alternatives, because they have no negative effect on the environment, and because they leave no residues in the fruit intended for export. Using biological control agents in combination to control insect pests emphasises the importance of knowing the biology of the target insect pest, as well as that of the biocontrol agents, such as EPNs and EPF.",

Pomegranate trees were sprayed with B. thuringiensis spores, and indigenous T. turkistanica was inundatively released during the pomegranate fruiting season from April to September of 2014. The highest infestation rates with E. ceratoniae and V. livia in control and treated trees gradually increased until the end of the season, reaching 79, 54 and 22 % for E. ceratoniae, and 22, 16 and 7 % for V. livia in control, Bacillus-treated trees, and Trichogramma-treated trees, respectively. The mean percentages of fruits infested with E. ceratoniae or V. livia were significantly different between the untreated trees and both the trees treated with Trichogramma and those treated with Bacillus. Moreover, the trees treated with Trichogramma had a lower infestation rate by both E. ceratoniae and V. livia compared to the trees treated with Bacillus. The number of larvae collected from infested fruits varied from one to two larvae per fruit for both E. ceratoniae and V. livia. Use of Bacillus or native Trichogramma to control these pests can achieve high yields of Taify pomegranate of better quality.",

    "abstract": "Aedes albopictus (Skuse) was first recorded in Nigeria in 1991 during a post epidemiological surveillance of yellow fever epidemics in Delta State. In this report, we present a map of the current distribution of Ae. albopictus and its possible epidemiological implications based on accessible records of mosquito fauna in Nigeria using electronic e-journal searching engines. We also report the results of a field study on population dominance between Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus in a woodland habitat in southwestern Nigeria between March and November 2002. Of over 100 accessible papers on mosquito fauna in Nigeria, only 18 have reported information on Ae. albopictus. Literature shows that Ae. albopictus became well established in southeastern Nigeria and then spread to other southern regions. There was no information about the species in northern Nigeria except Kano where a record of its breeding was reported. Data showed dominance of Ae. albopictus over Ae. aegypti in southeastern Nigeria but the reverse was observed during a field investigation at Ikenne farm settlement in southwestern Nigeria. Aedes albopictus was perhaps involved in the transmission of arboviral infections and Bancroftian filariasis in southern Nigeria. Data show that Ae. albopictus is well established in southern Nigeria but not in arid zones of the country. Its establishment and role as a vector of arboviral infections and Bancroftian filariasis in southern Nigeria should be a source of concern. The present report therefore serves as a baseline map for future epidemiological surveillance and the understanding of ecological distribution of Ae. albopictus in the country.",

We attempted to force generalist, hemipteran-tending ants into a degree of dietary specificity by spatially partitioning and simplifying their trophic web. Pupae of Helicoverpa armigera, Thaumatotibia leucotreta and Ceratitis capitata introduced into a citrus orchard survived significantly better in plots where all nests of two pestilent, generalist ant species namely Anoplolepis custodiens and Pheidole megacephala had been poisoned compared with untreated control plots. In some plots the ants' foraging environments were partitioned into arboreal and epigaeic trophic webs using sticky barriers to prevent ground-nesting ants from ascending the trees. Plots partitioned this way showed suppressed levels of survival of emplaced pest pupae that were similar to those in unpartitioned control plots. Pest survival was significantly lower for T. leucotreta than for H. armigera and C. capitata, implicating prey body size or life cycle duration as factors in predation by ants. Pheidole megacephala and the predator complex as a whole can be valuable agents in the natural control of soil-pupating citrus pests if they are restricted to the ground. Trunk banding, rather than poisoning, is therefore recommended as part of managing ecologically mercenary ants in citrus orchards.",

First instar nymphs were more sensitive than the fourth instars followed by adults. Clove oil induced highly significant contact toxic effects against P. americana nymphs and adults after 4, 24 and 48 h exposure. First and fourth instar nymphs were more sensitive to clove oil (LC50 values of 0.0001 and 0.0077 µl/cm2, respectively) than rosemary oil (LC50 values of 1.92 and 2.25 µl/cm2) after 24 h, respectively. Regarding adults, the effect of both oils was very weak after 48 h exposure. Adults of P. americana were the least sensitive to clove and rosemary oils, recording LC50 values 1.5375 and 6.09 µl/cm2, respectively. In continuous exposure tests, LT50 values correlated negatively with concentrations. Clove oil had lower LT50 values than rosemary oil. For clove oil the lowest LT50 values ranged between 14.10 and 4.85 h in case of the first instar at low concentration level of 0.0005–0.0020 µl/cm2 and 20.00 to 5.00 h for adults at high concentration level of 2.0–3.0 µl/cm2.

In inhalation tests, after 24 h of exposure at a dose of 37.5 µl essential oil, Cupressus sempervirens originating from Algeria and Tunisia caused 100 % mortality in adults of C. maculatus.

    "abstract": "Madeira vine, Anredera cordifolia (Ten.) Steenis subsp. cordifolia (Basellaceae), is native to South America but has become invasive and problematic in many countries, including South Africa. Weedy vines are notoriously difficult to control through conventional mechanical and chemical means, so biological control of A. cordifolia in South Africa was initiated in 2003. No agents have yet been released against this plant in South Africa but exploratory observations on the life-history and host-specificity of two leaf-feeding beetles, Phenrica sp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) from Brazil and Plectonycha correntina Lacordaire (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Chrysomelinae) from Argentina and Brazil, are reviewed here. Adults and larvae of both chrysomelids feed extensively on leaves and new growth of A. cordifolia, resulting in leaf and above-ground biomass reductions. The laboratory host-ranges of these potential agents seem acceptably narrow, with normal development restricted to the host plant. Adult feeding was recorded on other non-indigenous species within the Basellaceae, Portulacaceae and Talinaceae. The Phenrica sp. colony, being reared in quarantine, died out and re-collection has not been possible. Host-specificity studies are continuing on P. correntina.",

There was a significant difference between the overall fecundity of the spring (137.2 eggs/female) and summer (159.3 eggs/female) moths. During the first third of October, spring moths produced significantly fewer eggs than in November. Egg mortality in spring was 8.2 %, and in summer 21.2%. The increased summer egg mortality was due to the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma luteum Girault (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). During spring and summer, mortality due to infertile and fertile but unhatched eggs was less than 5 %. In the absence of entomophagous insects, the failure of first instar larvae to penetrate the fruit ranged from 4.9 to 19.5 %. The mortality of larvae from egg hatch to emergence from the fruit ranged from 29.7 to 43.8 %. Mortality of fifth instar larvae in cocoons spun in corrugated cardboard after emerging from the fruit was low, ranging from 0 to 8.7 %. Pupal mortality varied from 0 to 3.5 %. These studies indicate that codling moth in South Africa probably has a higher biotic potential than in most other apple-producing countries.",

Genetic distinction of fig cultivars in Italian isles and natural populations occurring in the Mediterranean basin (Khadari et al. 2005), indicate introduction from the east Arabian Peninsula (Kislev et al. 2006). Eisen (1901) suggested that this introduction to Europe occurred around 800 B.C. by the Phoenicians and Greeks. Under Roman rule they spread to the rest of Europe, but only slowly towards the east, with the first documented edible figs appearing in China by A.D. 1550. At first the fig was considered a luxury for the rich, but it soon became a traded commodity, forming an integral part of the human diet. The ideal climate of Portugal for fig production secured the development of a superior industry there. With the explorations of the Spanish and Portuguese, figs were subsequently established in almost all countries they visited. Today figs are grown all over the world, but they especially favour a warm-temperate Mediterranean-type climate. Figs require sufficient moisture during the active growth period, but a warm dry climate when fruit are ripening (P. Botma, pers. comm.). The winter rainfall areas of South Africa, such as the Swartland and Klein Karoo in the Western Cape are therefore ideal for fig cultivation whereas fruit quality is negatively affected by higher fungal contamination in summer rainfall areas (M. Wohlfarter, pers. obs.).",

This study was conducted to determine the effects of pigment colour and dose in marking the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Six pigment colours (Astral Pink 1, Blaze 5, Stellar Green 8, Lunar Yellow 27, Comet Blue 60 and Invisible Blue 70) were applied to pupae at doses of 0, 2, 4, or 6 g/l. Under laboratory conditions, pigment colour had a small but significant effect on the number of partially emerged and deformed adults; the fewest of these were observed when flies were marked with Astral Pink 1. Pigment concentration, on the other hand, had no effect on adult emergence, partial emergence, deformed adults and mortality on the last day of eclosion. There was no significant effect of pigment colour on adult survival under laboratory and semi-field conditions. Under laboratory conditions, however, there was an effect of pigment concentration on adult survival depending on pigment colour. Visibility under an ultraviolet light and persistence of marks was significantly affected by pigment colour and concentration when observed under laboratory conditions, but not under semi-field conditions. Regardless of colour or dose, pigments used in the study were visible for at least 14 days, but began to fade by 21 days after adult eclosion. To mark B. dorsalis under temperate, warmsummer African conditions, all pigment colours tested in this study may be applied at 2–4 g/l pupae. Recaptures of marked and released flies may be underestimated as the flies age.",

From a collection of over 3500 bat flies, two species were identified — Eucampsipoda madagascarensis (n = 3227) of the family Nycteribiidae and Megastrebla wenzeli (n = 350) of the family Streblidae. The number of E. madagascarensis per bat host showed seasonal variation with a notable reduction during the rainy season. The sex ratio of E. madagascarensis was significantly biased towards males, and this pattern was more pronounced during the dry season. In comparison, M. wenzeli, which were distinctly less common, showed statistical differences between the three site visits in prevalence, but not for the number of parasites per host. For E. madagascarensis parasitism rates varied with age and sex, with adult male R. madagascariensis having more ectoparasites than females, subadults and neonates, while no difference in parasitism rate was found for M. wenzeli based on host age and sex.",

Filter paper impregnated with an appropriate volume (5, 10, 20, 40 μl/ml) of the oils were attached to the lower surface of the jar lid. Mortality counts were made at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment. For ovicidal activity, seeds having 20 eggs altogether were put in a glass vial and the treatments were followed as mentioned earlier. After 48 h of exposure the seeds with eggs were transferred and ovicidal activity was calculated based on the adult emergence. Among the essential oils tested, five oils, viz. camphor, eucalyptus, nutmeg and rosemary showed 100 % mortality even at lower dosages (5 μl) when adults were exposed for 48 h. On the other hand, seven oils showed 100%mortality at higher concentration (40 μl). Ovicidal activity revealed that 9 oils showed good activity against C. maculatus at higher concentrations. Among them four oils, viz. camphor, eucalyptus, rosemary and wintergreen showed 100 % egg mortality. In this work, it can be concluded that camphor, eucalyptus, nutmeg, rosemary, wintergreen oils showed very good fumigant and ovicidal activity. However, the possibility of utilising these plant oils to control C. maculatus in storage conditions may warrant further investigation.",

Therefore, the objective of this work is to investigate genetic variation in the carob moth among and within three host-plants by three RAPD markers. The results showed high genetic diversity in the pest. The mean percentage of polymorphic loci was 78.38 %. The total variance percentage of 5 % among populations and 95 % within the populations is suggestive of the role of sexual reproduction for generating high genetic diversity. The average genetic distances among populations ranged from 0.028 to 0.043. The date population is more related to the pomegranate population compared to citrus specimens. The UPGMA dendrogram and the two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) showed that there is no correlation between E. ceratoniae genotypes and their host plants and geographic localisation suggesting that gene flow between populations is independent of geographic distance and appears to be unrestricted.",

    "abstract": "Stingless bees are important resources for pollination of crops, production of medicinal honey and other products. However, throughout the developing countries in Africa, meliponiculture has received less attention in beekeeping development programmes. Here, the current situation of stingless beekeeping in Uganda is assessed. First, stingless bee species utilised for their products were collected and identified. Thereafter, the economic benefits derived from stingless beekeeping in the Western Highlands agro-ecological zones of Uganda with anecdotal reports of meliponiculture were analysed. The findings reveal that stingless beekeeping is in its early stages of development in Uganda. Four stingless bee species were identified: Meliponula bocandei, Meliponula nebulata, Meliponula ferruginea and Plebeina hildebrandtii that are currently used for honey and propolis. These stingless bee species can be selected for domestication, targeting different products such as honey, propolis and pollen to make meliponiculture more profitable. Indigenous knowledge of beekeepers that can assist in locating wild stingless bee nests for domestication was documented as it is essential for the preservation of this practice. In order to transform the stingless beekeeping industry in Uganda, training needs such as hive making, colony management, product harvesting and processing will have to be addressed.",

Juss ex Kunth var. stans (Bignoniaceae) is an invasive shrub or small tree from Central America that continues to extend its range in all nine provinces of South Africa and in neighbouring countries. The weed has been a target for biological control (biocontrol) in South Africa since 2003. The gall-forming rust fungus Prospodium transformans (Ellis & Everh.) Cummins (Pucciniales: Uropyxidaceae) was released in 2010, but failed to establish. Two leaf-feeding agents, Mada polluta (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Pseudonapomyza sp. Hendel (Diptera: Agromyzidae), were subsequently released in South Africa in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Mada polluta has become established at seven sites in the low elevation coastal regions of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, but not in high elevation inland areas. The leaf-mining Pseudonapomyza sp. has established at seven sites in four provinces, namely the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga, but at low population densities. The deliberate destruction of release sites by landowners and inadvertent veld fires have confounded the establishment and proliferation of both agents, as well as progress on their post-release evaluation. A root-feeding flea beetle Heikertingerella sp. Csiki (Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae), initially collected in Mexico in 2007, was determined to be host specific and potentially effective as a new biocontrol agent of T. stans. An application for the release of Heikertingerella sp. in South Africa will shortly be submitted to the regulatory authorities. Additional mass-rearing and releases of the two established agents will be undertaken to improve their establishment and impact.",

Crude aqueous fruit extract of C. cartilaginea was less toxic against Aedes caspius (LC50 = 172.02) compared to its column chromatographic fraction F2 (LC50 = 29.17).

The plasma membrane remained well defined and the nuclei were normal and exhibited diffused staining of the chromatin. Most active component(s) responsible for toxic activity against Aedes caspius was present in the fraction F2 of C. cartilaginea, which showed larvicidal efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. As a result, fraction F2 is a good candidate as an alternative natural larvicidal agent with no hepatotoxicity and ata low cost. Further investigation is required to identify and characterize active compounds.",

Corythucha species have high host-specificity, whilst C. ciliata is the only lace bug known to feed on Platanus species (sycamores) - this association is thus considered to be diagnostic for the species (CABI 2014). C. ciliata has a broad native range across the eastern parts of North America and Canada, where it is largely monophagous on Platanus (sycamore) trees, with P. occidentalis being its main host. However, it also occurs on Platanus hybrids, and in invasive parts of its range feeds on P. orientalis and P. x acerifolia (the hybrid between P. occidentalis and P. orientalis (CABI 1984).",

Bt-maize has been planted in South Africa since 1998 for control of the maize stem borers, Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). No information is available on the possible effects that feeding on Bt-maize may have on other pests exposed to Cry1Ab protein when they attack seedlings or ears of Bt-maize. Important pests attacking maize seedlings are Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and Somaticus angulatus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), while Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a sporadic pest of maize ears. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of Bt-maize, expressing Cry1Ab protein, on these non-target pests. Laboratory studies in which larvae or adults of these species were fed with Bt and non-Bt-maize leaves or ears were conducted and mortality, growth, fecundity and fertility determined. Feeding on Bt-maize did not have a significant effect on any of these life-history parameters of H. arator or S. angulatus. In greenhouse and laboratory studies with H. armigera no larvae survived to the pupal stage on Bt-maize. This study showed that Cry1Ab-producing maize may protect the crop against H. armigera feeding damage. However, the likelihood of H. armigera becoming resistant to Cry1Ab protein over time, and it becoming an important secondary pest, is high.",

The study was designed to evaluate the larvicidal potency of jujube plant oil, dry ground leaves, and organic extracts of leaves using different solvents against third instar larvae. The ingredients of jujube were extracted by two ways: by grinding fresh leaves immediately in solvents or by soaking dry ground leaves powder in solvents for 72 h. The results showed that larvae were highly susceptible to jujube oil, plant extracts and crude plant powder. The best results were obtained with jujube oil, followed by the dry leaf extract in petroleum ether, and finally the crude plant powder. Histological and ultrastructural studies on jujube oil-treated larvae revealed that gut, muscles and cuticle layers were severely damaged, which indicates the toxic effect of jujube oil.

    "abstract": "The mango aphid, Aphis odinae (Toxoptera odinae) (Van der Goot) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an occasional, phytophagous sucking pest of mango. These aphids are very often associated with natural enemies and an ecological understanding, especially on insect—crop relationships, is needed in management. This will be manifested in altered sugar and amino acids contents of the plant. In light of this, the effect of aphid feeding on the content of total soluble sugars (TSS) and free amino acids (FAA) in mango shoots was studied. The amount of TSS and FAA in infested and uninfested shoots with varying levels of aphid infestation, namely low, medium and high, were quantified. Results indicated a significant reduction in the amount of TSS and FAA in infested shoots due to aphid feeding (P < 0.05). At maximal aphid abundance (251–300 aphids/shoot), TSS declined by 32 % and FAA by 47.5 %. Further, regression analysis between aphid numbers and the quantity of TSS/FAA yielded simple linear equations with R2 = 0.99, which can be used as an alternative way to estimate aphids numbers. The present study discusses the influence of aphid herbivory in mango shoots, a critical factor in understanding aphid–plant interactions and their damage to the host. It can be possibly extended to similar other aphid infestations.",

    "abstract": "Intensification of agriculture can have spin-offs on surrounding areas and ecosystems. There is a necessity to pursue sustainable agricultural practices to meet the increasing demand for food production while aligning with international conservation targets. Arthropod pest control techniques in Cape Floristic Region pome orchards, South Africa, that preserve biodiversity while simultaneously controlling pests, are reviewed here. Emphasis is placed on the chronic pests: Mediteranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) (Wiedemann), Natal fruit fly (Ceratitis rosa) (Karsch) and codling moth (Cydia pomonella) (L.), while other sporadic and perennial pests are also considered. Biological control (biocontrol) is an important, sustainable pest control measure. However, certain risks associated with releasing living organisms into the environment must not be ignored. Monitoring of release programmes is essential. The sterile insect technique (SIT) offers a species-specific approach for controlling pests. However, the technique is research and management intensive. Globally SIT has shown great success, but lack of financial support has limited SIT uptake in SouthAfricanpomefruit orchards. SIT has shown increased effectiveness as an integrated technique, particularly with parasitoid release and pheromone-based mating disruption. Habitat management, the preservation of natural vegetation and use of beneficial plant species increases crop resilience, encourages conservation biological control and maintains crop health. Area-wide control is stressed as a favourable strategy which deals with entire pest populations rather than isolated farm-by-farm approaches. Other techniques covered include pheromonebased mating disruption, attract-and-kill and physical barriers such as sticky tree-bands, which all show integration potential with biologically-based techniques, while minimising insecticide application. The usefulness of insecticides as a curative approach is recognised, and ways of preserving insecticide life-spans by limiting insect resistance are discussed.",

Maize crops were sampled in different ecological regions over a seven-year period. High population levels were only observed in the Mesophil sector of the Guinean ecological zone, where densities varied from 2-5 borers per stem in June plantings. Fluctuations in population density were attributed to three major factors: (1) timing of infestations, that appeared to be dependent on diapauses termination, which was influenced by rainfall at the end of March and during April; (2) numbers of larvae surviving diapause, that was dependent on severity of the dry season, on the occurrence of bush fires and on egg parasitism; (3) maize planting dates, which resulted in a coincidence between the plant growth stage favourable to the pest and the oviposition periods. Two egg parasitoids, Telenomus busseolae Gahan and T. isis Polaszek (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) were collected. The first species was predominant (72 % of parasitized eggs). Five parasitoids were reared from larvae and pupae. Of these, Tetrastichus atriclavus Waterston (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was dominant (91 % of parasitized insects). The percentage parasitism of larvae and pupae was less than 10 % and appeared to have little influence on the population dynamics of B. fusca in the Ivory Coast.",

    "abstract": "The Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia) was first discovered on wheat in South Africa during 1978. It has since become a serious pest. The leaf epicuticular wax ultrastructure and leaf trichomes were examined on two Russian wheat aphid-susceptible wheat cultivars (‘Palmiet’ and ‘Tugela’) and a Russian wheat aphid-resistant wheat cultivar (‘Tugela DN’). The lengths of the trichomes showed no significant differences in the three wheat cultivars examined. The resistant cultivar (‘Tugela DN’) had a significantly greater trichome density compared to the susceptible cultivars. Examination of the position of the trichomes revealed that there were differences for the adaxialand abaxialsurfaces. Trichomes on allthree wheat cultivars were found to occur mostly on the leaf veins of the adaxial surfaces, and on the leaf veins as wellas between them on the abaxialsurfaces. Leaf trichome density and position may act as a physical obstacle to Russian wheat aphid feeding as the aphid feeds on leaf veins of the adaxial leaf surfaces. The high trichome density on the leaf veins found in the resistant ‘Tugela DN’ cultivar could prevent the Russian wheat aphid from finding a suitable feeding site. Comparison of the scanning electron micrographs showed that the epicuticular wax structure was simil ar on both the adaxialand abaxialsurfaces amongst the three wheat cultivars, and does not seem to affect Russian wheat aphid feeding.",

Decisions regarding spraying in orchards under mating disruption are less reliable than in orchards not under mating disruption (7 % and 3 % probability of making an incorrect decision respectively).

Linepithema humile failed to disperse heavy elaiosome-bearing seeds, although it readily removed lighter seeds like those of Polygala myrtifolia. This suggests that areas dominated by small ant species like L. humile would be characterized by low dispersal rates for heavy seeds. Indigenous ants in areas uninvaded and invaded by L. humile did not respond equally well to six elaiosome-bearing seeds. More of the heavier Leucospermum cordifolium than the lighter Podalyria calyptrata and Paranomus reflexus seeds were removed by ants in uninvaded areas. In invaded areas the heavier P. myrtifolia seeds were dispersed more readily than the lighter Agathosma ovata seeds. There was no indication of any specificity in the seed-ant interaction because the introduced ant, L. humile, dispersed smaller seeds. In addition, P. calyptrata, which occurs naturally in the study area, was not taken preferentially to other species of seed by myrmecochorous ants.",

Each mosquito was first identified morphologically as Anopheles gambiae Giles, then to sibling species by PCR and An. gambiae s.s. forms were further identified by restriction analysis. The parity of Anopheles mosquitoes were determined and ELISA-based methods used to determine Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infections and host blood meal source. More Anopheles mosquitoes were obtained at Okyereko. Members of the An. Gambiae complex were dominant at Okyereko and An. funestus at Bewadze. Within the An. gambiae complex, only An. gambiae s.s. was identified, and the M form constituted 91.7 % at Okyereko and 66.7 % at Bewadze. The biting rate was higher at Okyereko, but parous rates were similar in both villages. The infection rates were 2.5-fold higher in An. funestus than An. gambiae at both sites, but were 17.5-fold lower at Okyereko. At Okyereko, the four infective An. gambiae s.s. were found to be the M form while at Bewadze three of the four infective An. gambiae s.s. were found to be the S form and one was the M form. The entomological inoculation rate was also significantly lower at Okyereko. The human blood index was 84.1 % at Okyereko and 77.1 % and Bewadze.

    "abstract": "A quantitative dung beetle survey (Coleoptera : Scarabaeidae : Scarabaeinae) was conducted in six Gauteng nature reserves (Tswaing, Leeuwfontein, Roodeplaat, Ezemvelo, Abe Bailey, Suikerbosrand) representative of the provincial range in environmental conditions. The study provided a provincial species inventory that has been tested for completeness by comparison with museum reference material. It also permitted an analysis of major influences on regional (altitude, annual rainfall) and local (soil and vegetation type) patterns of species abundance. The survey recorded a total of 152 species. Although a further 29 species were represented in reference collections, their absence from the present work was probably due to habitat, food, or temporal specializations. Multivariate analyses (clustering, MDS) of species abundance data formed six clusters, each comprising exclusively the sites in single reserves. This indicates that regional between-reserve faunal differences are greater than local within reserve differences, thus demonstrating the value of each reserve. In a hierarchical analysis of oblique factors, five out of seven statistically defined clusters comprised exclusively the sites in single reserves with Suikerbosrand split in two. These clusters were variously correlated with nine extended factors. Along seven factors, correlations were unique or essentially unique to single reserves and were fairly high, particularly at intermediate altitude. Along the remaining two shared factors, there were opposing trends in that correlations either decreased with higher altitude or decreased with lower altitude. Thus, each cluster shows three coefficients of determination, one representing the proportion of variance due to shared highland faunal influence, one representing that due to shared lowland faunal influence and the third representing that due to unique local faunal composition. The analyses identify the transition from lowland to highland-dominated faunas, the relative faunal distinctiveness of each reserve, and omissions from the provincial reserve system.",

The lowering of minimum allowable pesticide residue limits is effectively causing the loss of pesticides that have served humankind for decades.

A good example is a commercial preparation of a granulovirus currently registered in South Africa that can be bought, stored and sprayed using conventional machines to control a phytosanitary pest such as false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta) (Moore et al. 2005; National Department of Agriculture 2007). Currently three Beauveria bassiana preparations are registered in South Africa against plant pests such as aphids, weevils and nematodes (National Department of Agriculture 2007). The virulence of B. bassiana is constantly being improved by selection and genetic engineering techniques (Yanhau et al. 2007).

Consistency of behavioural patterns in different caging systems was assessed. The diurnal feeding patterns of female flies were influenced by type of cage, being uniform throughout the day in laboratory cages and changing to either bimodal or unimodal, depending on species, in the greenhouse. In contrast, feeding patterns of male flies were consistent among caging systems, and were uni-modal in C. fasciventris and C. capitata with a peak in morning and late afternoon, respectively. For both sexes of all species, highest feeding frequencies were recorded in field cages. In all three species, diurnal patterns of reproductive behaviour, such as periodicity of calling and mating (except for oviposition) were not affected by cage type. However, for C. capitata, higher frequency of calling was observed in the greenhouse, while higher frequency of mating was observed in field cages. We discuss the rationale for use of a greenhouse rather than standard field cages for pre-release evaluation of reproductive performance of sterile C. capitata males in SIT programmes.",

The optimum oviposition period and minimum number of randomly selected weevils (Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky) from a laboratory culture (without the procedure of sexing) to achieve similar progeny emergence to the standard method were determined under laboratory conditions. While results confirmed the effectiveness of the standard method in discriminating genotypes according to resistance, some modifications significantly reducing labour and level of skill required in implementing a rapid screening protocol were identified. Sex ratios in random samples of 10–50 weevils from a large laboratory culture were not significantly different from the 1:1 expected ratio (P >0.05) and therefore sexing of the populations was discarded. Infestation of grain with 32–50 weevils resulted in progeny emergence and kernel damage similar to the standard. Therefore, 32 weevils were recommended to infest grain for 10 days, without prior conditioning of insects to the test grain. Standard control hybrid varieties were also effectively validated. The modified procedure took 45–56 days to complete compared to about 90 days for the standard and did not sacrifice selection efficiency.",

The current study along with El Husseiny et al. (2015) and Bream et al. (2017) can be considered the first of such studies in Egypt. The survey was conducted during the period April 2015 to February 2016, in the permanent stream, El-Mansouriya, in Dakahlia province, Egypt. The water quality and health status of water for human use of this stream was determined using different aquatic invertebrate family biotic indices formulations (BMWP, SWRC and EPT indexes) along with the physical and chemical properties. Water samples were analysed and the water quality parameters were compared to the WHO (2004) standards. Most of the parameters were found to be within permissible limits, except for turbidity and nutrient salts. Aquatic insects were collected and identified to order and family levels. A total of seven orders and 19 families were collected, including a few intolerant insects (EPT orders) and insects more tolerant to pollution (chironomid larvae). The values of the water quality parameters sampled showed significant correlations with aquatic insect diversity. The canonical correspondence analysis clarified that the electrical conductivity of the water was the most significant variable affecting the variation in taxa. From these results it can be seen that the water quality of this stream is moderately impacted, and could therefore be considered harmful, since this stream is the main supply to the Water Central Station in Aga. Water quality degradation is generally due to impacts associated with population growth, industrialisation and agricultural activities. These results can be used to assist in conservation planning and decision-making in Egypt.",

The stem-galling fly, Cecidochares connexa (Macquart) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a biological control agent for C. odorata, was released in the Ivory Coast in 2003 and first detected in Ghana in 2014. The spatiotemporal distribution and abundance of C. connexa in Ghana was determined by country-wide surveys from 2015 to 2016. Galls were found in varying densities across Ghana but gall densities were consistently low east of Lake Volta. A limited survey conducted in the extreme west of Togo in 2016, found the gall fly also in low numbers. There was a significant correlation between C. connexa gall densities and the distance from the release sites in the Ivory Coast. The distribution and abundance of the gall fly in Ghana could be explained by its spread from the original release sites over time and/or the much drier conditions east of Lake Volta. Cecidochares connexa has dispersed a distance of about 1000 km over a 10-year period and, while there is some evidence that the gall fly is still dispersing towards the east, its range and population size could be limited by the dry climatic conditions in the east of Ghana and in Togo.Actively redistributing the agent over this dry corridor to the more humid and higher rainfall areas of Nigeria, may result in the spread of this agent through the rest of West and Central Africa, thereby aiding the control of C. odorata in the region.",

Recent research indicated that populations of both species are still restricted to the Western Cape Region, where the Cape Fold Mountain Belt seems to serve as a barrier to further spread to the rest of South Africa. The limited distribution range creates a favourable scenario for management efforts and, if acted on rapidly, increases the possibility of successful control.

The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was inadvertently introduced to several countries via contaminated seed, but was released as a biological control agent in South Africa. Although widely established in South Africa, its efficacy may be curtailed because damage is reputed to be confined to canopy-held seeds, with dehisced seeds escaping damage on the ground. To clarify the beetle's potential, we investigated: (i) its selection of oviposition sites when presented with pods bearing seeds, loose seeds and empty pods in different locations (canopy-versus ground-held); and (ii) the effect of seed location on egg mortality. The beetles oviposited on pods bearing seeds, loose seeds and empty pods in both locations but showed significant preferences for pods bearing seeds, regardless of location. Egg mortality was high (66% overall) and caused largely by predation, but did not differ between canopy- and ground-held seeds. Dehisced seeds are thus more likely to escape damage due to the beetle's greater association with pods bearing seeds, which occur mostly in the canopy. While not affected by seed location, egg predation could affect beetle population densities. Although oviposition patterns and egg predation may constrain the efficacy of A. macrophthalonus, seed damage in relation to seed availability still needs to be quantified in the field.",

Despite the introduction of the South American leaf-feeding tortoise beetle, Gratiana spadicea (Klug) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Cassidinae) in 1994, the weed has continued to spread. Although established in a number of regions, beetle populations appear to persist in relatively low numbers, inflicting minimal damage to the weed. Consequently, a number of variables have been investigated in order to explain this lack of efficacy, and in some cases, failure to establish. Gratiana spadicea populations in South Africa are under considerable stress both from abiotic and biotic sources. Population-limiting factors such as disturbance of overwintering sites, climatic incompatibility, and high rates of pupal parasitism translate into low numbers of the agent at the start of each growing season. Small early-season populations which are slow to build-up, coupled with asynchronous development of S. sisymbriifolium, limit the beetles' effectiveness and pre-empt any impact on the weeds' reproductive output. Consequently, G. spadicea alone is unlikely to control S. sisymbriifolium infestations in South Africa.

    "abstract": "Lepidopteran stem borers are important pests of maize and sorghum in East and southern Africa. Except for Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), the other important lepidopteran pests of maize and sorghum, Busseola fusca (Fuller), and Sesamia calamistis Hampson, are indigenous to the African continent. As some stem borers became pest, some species remained in the natural habitats where they still infest non-cereal host plants. However, understanding the diversity of stem borer species that remained in uncultivated habitats and their role in pest dynamics received little attention in research. With the current changes in the natural habitats, some of the species in these habitats may switch to become pests. In addition to host switch, some of the unknown species currently restricted to natural habitats may disappear altogether. Several studies have been undertaken in Tanzania to assess stem borer species diversity. However, there are challenges in comparing diversity values among different zones due to differences in sampling protocols. In this study, a standardised sampling protocol was used and the paper presents a catalogue of stem borer species and their respective hosts in five different vegetation mosaics in Tanzania.",

Historically there has been no fruit fly infestation recorded on lemons destined for export from South Africa. In this study, we assessed the host status of commercial export grade Eureka lemons, Citrus limon (L.) Burmanf. cv. Eureka, for four fruit fly pest species of economic importance in South Africa: Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), Ceratitis rosa Karsch, Ceratitis quilicii De Meyer, Mwatawala & Virgilio, and Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). Trapping was conducted in 10 Eureka lemon orchards in two major citrus production regions over two citrus seasons between 2016 and 2017 to determine the level of fruit fly abundance in the sampled orchards. Lemons were collected at harvest over the two seasons in the same orchards where trapping was conducted. Fruit fly infestation of the sampled lemons was determined by dissection. Additionally, infestation of lemons was determined under forced exposure to mature mated females of C. capitata and B. dorsalis. Trapping data showed the presence of adults of all four fruit fly species in the sampled lemon orchards. No fruit fly infestation was detected in 43 222 Eureka lemons sampled at harvest. There was also no infestation of lemons under forced exposure conditions. The results of this study provide evidence with 99.99 % efficacy and a 99%confidence level that SouthAfrican commercial export grade Eureka lemon fruit is not a host for C. capitata, C. rosa, C. quilicii or B. dorsalis.",

The results showed a significant change in the phenoloxidase activity as a function of photosensitiser concentrations. The ultrastructure of midgut tissues revealed obvious damages in different cellular levels. There was no significant effect on DNA. So, it can be concluded that Cu-chl and Mg-chl caused C. pipiens larvae death via the physical damage of larval tissues, and the direct effect on biochemical and physiological parameters of larval viability. Healthy DNA molecules, after the larval treatment, reflected no chance for the undesired mutation of the sublethal concentration of Cu-chl and Mg-chl.",

This study was carried out to establish the diversity, distribution and incidence of Rhynchophorus spp. on E. guineensis at three production set-ups namely large-scale plantations, adaptive trials and small-scale farms in three (Lake Victoria Crescent, Lake Albert Crescent and Western Highlands) agro-ecological zones in Uganda; and to establish the effect of vicinity to natural vegetation on incidence of the pest. Two surveys were conducted in 2018 during the dry and wet seasons. Oil palm trees in each study site were scored as infested (1) or not infested (0) with Rhynchophorus spp. Heavily infested oil palms were sampled to collect weevils for morphological identification and were found to be of only one species, Rhynchophorus phoenicis(Fabricius, 1801). Incidence of R. phoenicis was compared across sampling sites, season and proximity to natural vegetation; and subjected to a multiple linear regression with temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. Incidence of R. phoenicis was highest in Masaka district in the western side of River Nile in Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone; and absent in Mayuge and Bugiri district at the eastern side of River Nile in Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone. The pest incidence was higher in the wet than the dry season; and in fields far away from natural vegetation than those that were nearer. Mean incidence of R. phoenicis did not correlate with temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. These findings offer clues of factors to consider in designing strategies for managing R. phoenicis in Uganda.",

To control F. occidentalis is extremely challenging, because of its cryptic behaviour, short life cycle, and resistance to many insecticides. The life history and success rate of WFT on chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora) leaflets and green bean pods (Phaseolus vulgaris) showed that more first instar larvae hatched, and developed faster, with a higher survival rate, on the former than on the latter, making chrysanthemum a more attractive and suitable host than were the green beans. A total of 11 local South African entomopathogenic nematode species and the exotic Steinernema feltiae, were tested, under laboratory conditions, for pathogenicity against WFT. Generally, Heterorhabditis spp. were more virulent than were the Steinernema spp. The study showed that locally isolated Steinernema yirgalemense (66 %), Heterorhabditis baujardi (67 %), and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (60 %) had potential for the control of F. occidentalis, in terms of targeting its soil-dwelling stages. Results from the temporal development study showed that both S. yirgalemense and H. baujardi were able to complete their life cycles in the host, and to produce a new cohort of infective juveniles.",

    "abstract": "Mango production and trade is a major source of employment, food and income in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Most of its production in SSA is under smallholder farming with a few commercial farms undertaking production. Fruits are traded both locally and some exported, with improved exotic varieties being preferred by consumers. However, mango export which is more lucrative to most exporters in terms of foreign currency exchange earnings, is currently faced with serious quarantine restrictions because of the invasive fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. Since its invasion in Africa, yield losses of up to 100 % have been recorded. In addition, loss of export due to restrictions has resulted in loss of potential revenue from lucrative markets such as the European Union. This study aimed at determining postharvest disinfestation parameters for B. dorsalis using hot-water treatments. To attain this, the development of B. dorsalis in the mango cultivar Tommy Atkins was determined. This information was used to treat different immature life stages at 46.1 °C for 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 min. Mortality of the different life stages over the different duration of treatments was determined. There was an increase in mortality with increasing duration of treatment for all life stages. The egg and first instar life stages were the most heat susceptible stages followed by the second instar larvae. The third instar was the most heat tolerant life stage evaluated and required treatment at 46.1 °C for 86.7 min (95 % CL (77.830–99.880)) to achieve 100 % mortality. Validation experiments at this temperature and treatment duration resulted in no survivors from the 41 542 third instar larvae treated in Tommy Atkins weighing 500–700 g. These results provide an effective treatment protocol which can be adopted by exporters in re-accessing currently inaccessible lucrative export markets in the U.S.A. and Europe.",

    "abstract": "This special issue is the fourth decadal review of biological control of invasive alien plants (biocontrol of weeds) in South Africa, following those published in 1991, 1999 and 2011. Including this introduction, there are 24 papers covering the weed biocontrol programmes, or important developments in the science and practice, from the period 2011-2020. Seventy-two target weed species are covered, including 25 species on which projects were initiated during the past decade. Developments in regulations, mass-rearing and implementation, and community engagement are also reviewed. An updated catalogue of agents released, rejected and under consideration is presented and reflects the most recent methods of quantifying success in weed biocontrol. Key events over the last decade include the hosting of the XIV International Symposium on Biological Control of Weeds to celebrate 100 years of weed biocontrol in South Africa, as well as the establishment of the Centre for Biological Control at Rhodes University. The science and practice of weed biocontrol has expanded significantly in the past decade, with growth in the number of researchers and practitioners, increased funding, and an increased number of scholarly outputs. Unlike many other countries in the world, South Africa has largely avoided constraints due to restrictive and risk averse legislation and bureaucracy, and has continued to release new biocontrol agents at a similar rate to that in previous years. Much of the success of weed biocontrol in South Africa is due to the sustained and increasing support of the Natural Resource Management Programme of the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (Working for Water Programme). However, gaps in funding, where no funds are available for months at a time, are a major concern as the weed biocontrol community loses human capital in these periods, and research programmes suffer significant set-backs. Weed biocontrol is an essential component of South Africa's strategy to reduce the negative impacts of invasive alien plants and has contributed significantly towards the protection of the country's ecosystems, indigenous biodiversity, water security, agricultural productivity, and society in general. If the trend of increasing support for weed biocontrol in South Africa continues, we can expect that the benefits for the country at large will increase substantially in the future.",

One of the pathogens of fruit flies is Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin; the introduction of this entomopathogen into the wild fly population would be beneficial for suppression of fruit fly populations. Five releases were made to study the dispersal behaviour and survival of sterile B. zonata males either treated or untreated with dry conidia of B. bassiana, in vegetable plantations bordered with papaya and mango trees in northern Mauritius from April 2010 to December 2012. The flies used were reared for ≈172 generations in the laboratory. Results showed that the dispersal behaviour and post-release survival were different for the two types of sterile males. Recapture rates of B. bassiana-treated sterile males (2.0 ± 1.4 %) were significantly lower than those of untreated flies (6.2 ± 5.5 %). However, the recapture rates for both types of males were within acceptable limits for release—recapture studies with mass-reared and irradiated fruit flies. Up to day 4 after release the percentage recovery of sterile B. zonata males untreated and treated with B. bassiana was 76 % and 81 %, respectively; 90 % of the recovered sterile flies from both groups were recovered up to 100 m from the release point, and only 4 % at a distance between 150 m and 200 m from the release point. Our results suggest that sterile B. zonata males could potentially be used as vectors of B. bassiana to supplement suppression of this pest in a sterile insect release programme.",

The pest incidence was consistently lower on C. arabica variety KP423 than on two other varieties KP162 and SL28, suggesting that KP423 is less susceptible to M. leuconotus. Correspondingly, KP423 yielded almost five-fold more coffee cherries than the other two varieties. Stem-smoothening and insecticide-banding did not significantly influence the incidence of M. leuconotus, while stemwrapping occasionally increased the incidence of the pest. None of the stem treatments influenced the yield of coffee cherries. These results support cultivation of KP423 in areas prone to M. leuconotus, and offer prospects for identification of resistance genes against the pest.

    "abstract": "The direct impact of broad-spectrum insecticides on primary parasitoids is considered a major contributing factor to the high pest status of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), in many parts of the world. As a result, selective insecticides are often put forward as a solution to the problem of integrating chemical and biological control methods. However, there is paucity of studies that have directly contrasted effects of selective and broad-spectrum insecticides on parasitism rates and parasitoid species richness in the field. We compared effects of weekly and bi-weekly application regimes of a selective insecticide (Dipel®) and a broad-spectrum insecticide (dichlorvos) on parasitism rates of P. xylostella and species richness of its primary parasitoids against unsprayed control for two cropping seasons. Parasitoids were reared from immature P. xylostella in all treatments, and parasitism rates were not significantly different among the treatments. During October–December 2011, four species of primary parasitic Hymenoptera [Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Braconidae), Apanteles halfordi (Ullyett) (Braconidae), Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Eulophidae), and Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Ichneumonidae)] were reared from P. xylostella larvae and pupae, whereas three parasitoid species (C. vestalis, O. sokolowskii and D. collaris) were reared during March–May 2012. Cotesia vestalis accounted for >80%of total parasitism rates in all treatments. In both seasons, parasitoid species richness was highest on the control treatment. Although two parasitoid species were recorded on all Dipel® and dichlorvos treatments during October–December 2011, only one parasitoid species was recorded on Dipel® treatments during March–May 2012 compared to two species on dichlorvos treatments. Thus, insecticide application regime had no influence on parasitoid species richness, instead insecticide type did. Since P. xylostella infestations were significantly lower in Dipel® treatments in both seasons, this study suggests that a greater impact of a selective insecticide on the pest population density can affect parasitoid species richness more than the direct impact of a broad-spectruminsecticide with a short crop residual period.",

(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) were reported in Oklahoma, U.S.A. in 2012. Knowledge of the fitness effects associated with phosphine resistance is important for the development of resistance management strategies. Therefore, the goal of our study was to determine if there were fitness effects associated with phosphine resistance in populations of R. dominica and T. castaneum from Oklahoma. We measured population growth and developmental rates of phosphine-resistant and -susceptible populations of these two species in a phosphine-free environment. Three resistant R. dominica populations exhibited lower population growth and developmental rates compared to the susceptible population, whereas the only resistant T. castaneum population tested exhibited higher population growth and developmental rates compared to the susceptible population. Our data indicate that there is a fitness cost and possibly a fitness benefit, respectively, associated with phosphine resistance genes in these two species. In conclusion, phosphine resistance development in susceptible R. dominica populations can presumably be slowed by infrequent use of phosphine, whereas it can be mitigated by suspending phosphine use for extended periods of time in resistant populations. However, withholding phosphine use for long periods of time may not mitigate phosphine resistance in T. castaneum.",

    "abstract": "Spiders are a prominent group of predatory arthropods in most terrestrial ecosystems, and are especially diverse in the Savanna Biome of South Africa. Despite this, there is a considerable paucity of information on spider assemblages in particular microhabitats, including tree bark. The spiders associated with the bark of Vachellia xanthophloea (fever trees) were studied at five wetland sites in the Ndumo Game Reserve, South Africa. The influence of various seasonal, habitat and phenological effects on spider assemblages was investigated. In total, 8341 spiders were collected, of which only 2726 were adults (32.7 %), representing 25 families and 108 species. While total spider abundance and adult species richness did not differ significantly between sites, significant differences were found in adult abundance and in overall assemblages between sites. There were also no significant seasonal effects on spider assemblages and guild composition. Only eight of the species collected can be considered exclusive bark-dwelling spiders, while similar proportions are facultative bark-dwellers (43.5 %) or accidental bark-dwellers (49.1 %). This study demonstrates that targeted sampling of specialised microhabitats can yield a significant proportion of the spider diversity in a particular locality, and can contribute to understanding patterns of biodiversity in conserved areas.",

The aphid forms densely packed colonies covered with white, waxy, filamentous secretions, on the above-ground parts and on the roots of apple trees. The management of WAA primarily entails the use of resistant rootstocks, chemical and biological control, or the integration of all three strategies. Although Aphelinus mali is a specialised parasitoid of WAA, its level of control has been reported to be unsatisfactory as its parasitism is confined to the above-ground populations of WAA. Entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi that are important natural biological control agents of many insects and other arthropods are used to control a wide range of soilborne insects. The successful applications of these entomopathogens to control other soilborne insects raise the possibility of using them to target the subterranean populations of WAA. The review represents a combination of previous and current information on management practices for the control of WAA and the potential of integrating biocontrol agents such as entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi in a pest management system.",

    "abstract": "Savannahs are structurally complex ecosystems consisting of a diverse community of plants and animals such as arthropods. Arthropods are essential in many ecosystem processes that help maintain life on Earth. The anthropogenic conversion of natural landscapes into croplands, residential and industrial areas has a negative impact on surface-active arthropods that have limited dispersal abilities and narrow habitat preferences. This study investigated the effect of disturbance on assemblages of ants, beetles and spiders in the savannah vegetation in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. We compared species richness, abundance and composition of these three taxa between the pristine savannah and the savannah that is exposed to a variety of anthropogenic activities (disturbed savannah). Arthropods were collected using pitfall traps in 15 sites in pristine savannah and 15 sites in disturbed savannah. We found that disturbance affects species richness and abundance of these taxa differently. Disturbance did not affect species richness of spiders and abundance of beetles, while greater species richness of ants and beetles, as well as abundance of ants and spiders was in disturbed than in pristine savannah. Furthermore, the species compositions of all taxa were different between disturbed and pristine savannah. The disturbed savannah had twice more unique indicator species than the pristine savannah. Differences in assemblages of arthropods between pristine and disturbed habitats suggest that it may be important to consider habitats in and outside protected areas in the conservation of arthropods, particularly in areas with greater percentage of natural and semi-natural landscapes occurring outside protected areas.",

Several aspects of its biology and ecology were studied in two potato [Solanum tuberosum L. (Solanales: Solanaceae)] fields in the Sandveld region during both winter and summer months. The population densities of adult L. huidobrensis were monitored using yellow sticky traps, which were retrieved and counted once every two weeks (June 2019 to January 2020). The number of leaf miner adults caught throughout the summer and winter monitoring periods was significantly different. In addition, 50 randomly selected plants were assessed for leaf damage (in the form of punctures and mines) using presence/absence sampling. Leaf miner persistence within the soil was confirmed through one-time soil sampling of the two fields, one month after harvesting. Leaf miner pupae were detected in the soil samples after the potatoes were harvested. However, no adult emergence was recorded among the collected pupae under laboratory conditions. The observed trend was that the traps, in both fields, caught an increasing number of leaf miners as the crops matured. Damage occurred in both the monitored fields as early as week four, after plant emergence. Of the five parasitoid species collected, Diglyphus isaea (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was the most abundant.",

Ultraviolet (UV) light is known to have an effect on the survival of fungal conidia, and natural sunlight is potentially one of the most damaging factors undermining EPF persistence and pathogenicity. This study aimed to test the infection potential of an isolate of Beauveria bassiana and five Metarhizium species after exposure to different light treatments, on soil and leaf surfaces under laboratory and field conditions, using Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) as the test host. Conidia were exposed either to growth light alone, which emits the same visible light as the sun, but excluding UV light, or directly exposed to UV light for 12 h. The results indicated no negative effect on the infection potential of the conidia of most species tested. The conidia of the two Metarhizium pinghaense (5HEID and TH149) isolates showed the greatest tolerance to visible light and UV radiation exposure on both soil and leaf surfaces. Exposure of M. pinghaense isolates to visible light on soil surfaces showed pathogenicity of &gt; 80% for both isolates, and of between 58% and 88% after exposure to UV light.

Inundative releases, where large numbers of M. scutellaris are released regularly, have resulted in excellent establishment, and caused a significant reduction in water hyacinth cover in areas where, historically, biological control seemed unlikely due to excessive eutrophication.

In this study, fungi and bacteria were isolated from R. differens collected from Mbarara, Masaka, Hoima, Kampala and Kabale districts in Uganda in 2018, cultured on standard microbial media, identified using molecular techniques and screened for virulence against the insect in laboratory bioassays. Fourteen and nine species of fungi and bacteria were isolated from R. differens, respectively, with the number of isolates varying based on collection site. The most prevalent entomopathogenic fungal species were Aspergillus flavus Link (27.3%), Fusarium equiseti (Corda) (24.2%), Mucor fragilis Fresen (12.1%), Clonostachys rosea (Link) (6.0%) and Aspergillus tamarii Kita (6.0%); whereas the most prevalent bacterial isolates were Serratia marcescens Bizio (38.1%), Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (14.3%) and Enterobacter cloacae (Jordan) (14.3%). Nine of the fungal species namely Clavispora lusitaniae Rodrigues de Miranda, Lichtheimia corymbifera (Cohn), Trichoderma koningii Oudem, F. equiseti, M. fragilis, Aspergillus niger van Tieghem, Epicoccum sorghinum (Saccardo), C. rosea, Penicillium commune Charles Thom; and five bacterial species (Proteus penneri Hickman, S. marcescens, B. thuringiensis, Staphylococcus sciuri Kloos and Enterococcus faecalis (Andrewes and Horder)) were ~5–7-fold and ~4–5-fold, more lethal to third instars of R. differens than untreated controls, respectively. This study is the first to report C. lusitaniae, Exserohilum mcginnis Padhye and Ajello, E. sorghinum, P. penneri and E. cloacae as insect pathogens. The results suggest a need to quarantine field collected R. differens before introducing them into the insectary, as well as performing antimicrobial practices during rearing of the insect to prevent entomopathogen-based mortality.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species are the second largest contributor to biodiversity loss and drivers of ecosystem change. Buffelgrass is a C4, perennial grass native to Africa and Asia that was widely introduced across tropical and subtropical rangelands as livestock forage. Buffelgrass reduces native biodiversity and ecosystem stability in its introduced range when it escapes livestock pastures. Understanding the ecology of insects associated with buffelgrass in its native range may provide an understanding of invasion processes and biological control opportunities where buffelgrass has become an invasive challenge. Here, we present the results of a six-year survey of herbivorous arthropods of a native buffelgrass population from Kenya. Buffelgrass was examined for externally and internally feeding insects of vegetative and reproductive tissues. We also categorised buffelgrass detritivores and parasitoids that may use buffelgrass herbivores as hosts. The samples were photographed and Sanger sequenced to identify them to the lowest possible taxonomic ranking. We collected information on sample abundances, phenologies, tissues consumed, and putative diet breadths. We identified 25 morphospecies representing seven orders and 16 families. The putative host plant specialisation was as high as 67% for Diptera. Phenological variation in herbivore presence correlated with seasonal rainfall and provided a guide for when to conduct follow-up biological control agent searches. The most abundant herbivore was a gall midge (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) that inhabits buffelgrass culms. Additional research should focus on bringing this species into containment where host choice trials can be conducted to determine if it is truly monophagous and assess its impact on buffelgrass growth.",

Data on the body size and abundances of scarabaeine dung beetles from an arid, southern African savanna habitat, sampled over a 16-month period, and on the scaling of metabolic rate and population growth in insects, were used to examine these hypotheses. Coefficients of determination for the abundance: body size relationship were within the range expected from the sample size and size range of the assemblage when transient species were excluded. When transients were included the fit was poorer Transient species had a lower abundance than the resident species, but no difference in body size between the two groups was found. The mode of the species-body size frequency distribution was not predicted by the model when the required parameter values were obtained from the relationship between exact rates of increase (rm) and body mass (resource acquisition), and metabolic rate and body mass.",

Elaiosome-bearing seeds are located rapidly by ants and transported to nests where they are protected from granivorous rodents, desiccation and fire. This interaction is threatened by the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, which has displaced important myrmecochorous ant species in previously undisturbed areas. The impact of this infestation was assessed. Linepithema humile, which was active mainly at night, dispersed few seeds and removed most of the elaiosomes in situ. The majority of seeds were dispersed from invaded areas during the day by two indigenous species of ants, Tetramorium quadrispinosum and Ocymyrmex cilliei. Dispersal in uninvaded areas occurred mainly between 19:00 and 21:00 but was generally spread over a 24-hour period, indicating the participation of a complex of ant species. Significantly more seeds were dispersed in uninvaded areas than in areas invaded by L. humile. In invaded areas, there were no significant differences in the numbers of seeds dispersed by ants and the numbers eaten by rodents. In contrast, significantly more seeds were dispersed by ants than were eaten by rodents in uninvaded areas.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale monitoring programmes often make inferences about insect abundance based on count data collected using some probability-based sampling technique. Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to obtain reliable estimates of insect abundance from count data unless the scale is very fine or localized. A major issue, that has to be explicitly addressed when estimating insect abundance, is the problem of false negatives. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a simple approach to estimate insect abundance from occupancy data collected using presence–absence surveys. Using count data on the seed-feeding insect, Eurytoma sp. (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae), and the alien invasive insect, Heteropsylla cubana (Homoptera: Psyllidae), this paper has demonstrated the application of (1) generalized linear models for modelling abundance and detection probability, (2) information criteria for model selection and (3) occupancy-abundance models for precise estimation of insect abundance. Potential applications of this approach in monitoring colonization of sites by alien invasive species and local extinction of species endangered by habitat fragmentation are also indicated.",

Laboratory studies on toxicity against F1 progeny, contact toxicity and repellency against S. zeamais were conducted with ethanolic extracts of Vetiveria zizanioides roots, and Cupressus arizonica, Ocimum gratissimum, Eucalyptus grandis leaves. The ethanolic extracts of the last three plant species had significant toxicity (P = 0.01) on S. zeamais and against the F1 progeny. Percentage repellency was significant across the four plant extracts but highest in grains treated with V. zizanioides. Repellency was concentration-dependent and greater than 50 % at the lowest V. zizanioides extract concentration of 12 500 ppm. Vetiveria zizanioides could be a potential repellent for the protection of stored products against S. zeamais.",

The life cycle, adult size, fecundity, ovigeny, parthenogenesis, host age preference and host-searching behaviour by parasitoid females were studied under laboratory conditions. Oomyzus sokolowskiiapos;s life cycle lasted 15. 6 days. Sexual dimorphism was recorded, with females being bigger than males. The species is synovigenic. The parasitism rate was significantly different between mated and unmated females, which implied that mating stimulated the behaviour of parasitism. Thelythokous parthenogenesis was not recorded. Females could parasitize all larval stages and pre-pupae, but the parasitism rate was higher in the fourth larval stages of DBM. The host-seeking behaviour was influenced by host spatial patchiness; O. sokolowskii females performed better when they were placed in a 7 cm3 oviposition box. This study gives a better understanding of the life history traits of O. sokolowskii, which has been neglected in the biological control of DBM in tropical regions.

Considering the economic importance of this pest, it is necessary to understand the genetic diversity within and among its populations and investigate its dispersal mode. In the present study, the mitochondrial gene encoding the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was used to analyse the extent of genetic variation between samples of O. agamemnon arabicus, collected from geographically distant locations in Tunisia. A 505 bp DNA fragment, resulting from PCR amplification, was sequenced. Representative sequences were aligned, revealing nine polymorphic sites that identified eight haplotypes. Haplotype diversity (Hd) and Tajima's D neutral test were 0.707 and -0.043, respectively, indicating a low level of mtDNA variability. The calculated gene flow value was Nm = 0.47, indicating a high amount of gene flow occurring between populations from Tozeur and those from Kebili, although both departments are separated by the Chott-El-Jerid salt lake. The presence of common haplotypes between Tozeur and Kebili as well as the clustering pattern obtained by the NJ method confirmed this result. Based on these facts and considering the limited flight of O. agamemnon arabicus and its slow reproduction, it is likely that its expansion in Tunisia was facilitated mainly by human transportation of infected offshoots.",

Four orders of insects were encountered on flowers: Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. The last three orders made very few visits. The honeybee was the most abundant visitor in both years, representing 79 % and 78 % of recorded visits. Foraging honeybees visited on average nine flowers per minute and 27 flowers per tree, and flights were most frequent between adjacent trees of different rows (56 %). Only the flowers that received between three and five honeybee visits yielded fruit and the percentages of fruits formed were similar (31.6 % and 30.4 % in 2009 and 2010, respectively).",

The three species are monophagous on different graminaceous host plants, and the two sister species B. kaeaue and B. obliquifascia were collected in different ecological zones and altitudes, which suggests an ecological mode of speciation. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenies inferred from two mitochondrial genes showed that the genus is monophyletic and does not share a recent common ancestor with the genus Busseola.

In the cultivated area there are more psammophilic elements, lower individual density and population phenology which reflects marked summer aridity, whereas in the natural area summer activity of the beetles may occur. The characteristics of these eastern Algerian open land communities are discussed and compared with some European and African studies.",

The second experiment examined the effect of cypermethrin on the control of the pest on soya bean and groundnut at two sites. Among the host crops tested, soya bean was the most preferred by the pest followed by groundnut at all sites. The pest was also observed on pigeon pea at all sites, but the infestation was very low. Lucerne was observed as the less preferred host for this species. No infestation was observed on lablab bean across the sites. Spraying cypermethrin in groundnut and soya bean reduced infestation in both crops to very low levels. In the unsprayed plots, the high infestation levels significantly reduced crop yields.",

Serious outbreaks may result in reduced fruit yield. A natural parasite (Chrysonotomyia pulcherimma Kerrich, 1970) of the gall fly lays its eggs inside the gall and the larvae feed on the gall fly. Mango cultivars present varying susceptibilities to gall fly infestation, with cultivars ranging from completely resistant, highly susceptible to intermediate stages where pseudo-galls are formed. The latter cultivars are ovipositioned by the gall fly, but secondary metabolites within the leaves possibly halt the development, thereby preventing the development of true galls. Microscopy was used to identify characteristic features of the gall fly and its parasite inside the gall, to study the development of the insects and to distinguish them. Evidence was obtained that the use of insecticides curbs the development of the larvae. Tissue development within true and pseudo-galls was studied to provide insights into the role of secondary plant metabolites in arresting true gall formation. This study will contribute to a more holistic approach to pest management of mango.",

Different larval instars and adult thrips were provided as prey in different combinations (choice) or separately (no-choice). In choice test, no significant difference was observed in total thrips consumption per day. But in both observation hours (12 h or 24 h), a significant difference was observed between the feeding of immature and adult thrips. In a no-choice test,when we confined N. barkeri to feed on a specified diet of T. tabaci (first instar, second instar, or adults separately), a significant difference in total thrips consumption per day was observed in each prey group. In both tests, predatory mites fed more on first larval instar thrips compared to second larval instar and adults. However, consumption rate was rather higher during initial feeding hours (12 h) and slowed down later (24 h); this may be due to aggressive predation initially. The findings suggest that N. barkeri feed more on younger instars of T. tabaci and if these predators are released during early pest outbreak it will control the thrips population.",

    "abstract": "The South African avocado industry is export-oriented, with approximately 3.0 % of international market share and with a five-year mean annual production of 118 000 t from 17 500 ha. Feeding by thrips results in fruit scarring and corky tissue development, making the fruit unsuitable for export. The study aimed to identify the spectrum of thrips in avocado flowers and more importantly, to confirm the identity of the thrips species responsible for damaging fruit. Thrips were collected from flowering panicles and identified using taxonomic keys. Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), Scirtothrips aurantii (Faure), Thrips gowdeyi (Bagnall), Thrips pusillus (Bagnall), Thrips tenellus (Trybom), Haplothrips gowdeyi (Franklin), Haplothrips bedfordi (Jacot-Guillarmod) and Megalurothrips sjostedti (Trybom) were consistently collected from May to September 2018. The minute size of thrips warranted a pre-season trial to determine the best netting material to contain thrips. Insect screen (149 µm), nylon netting (250 µm), chiffon (210 µm), voile (250 µm), organza (500 µm), tea filter paper (74 µm) and coffee filter paper (53 µm) were evaluated. The experiment was laid out as a randomised complete block design with six replications and the trials repeated twice. Only coffee filter paper and tea filter paper contained at least 85 % of the thrips and were therefore chosen for thrips exclusion trials. Surveillance by fruit sampling was undertaken to determine the natural host status of avocado to thrips. Avocado fruitlets were randomly sampled and incubated under laboratory conditions. Scirtothrips aurantii (Faure) (the South African citrus thrips) emerged from fruitlets and was sustained on that fruit to adulthood. This is the first study to demonstrate that avocado is a natural host to this pest in South Africa.",

The insects were exposed to fungal and bacterial treatments by larval immersion and diet incorporation method, respectively. Results revealed that the combined application of B. bassiana at the rate of 1.8 × 108 conidia/ml and B. thuringiensis at 0.5 and 1 µg/g exhibited synergistic effects, while combination of lower fungal concentration with both dose rates of B. thuringiensis showed additive effect against target instars of R. ferrugineus. Moreover, the mortality data showed that fifth instar larvae were more susceptible to microbial treatments than sixth instar. Maximum mycosis and sporulation was recorded in the cadavers of R. ferrugineus where B. bassiana was applied individually at dose rate of 1.8 × 107 conidia/ml. The present work suggests that B. bassiana in combination with B. thuringiensis could be a cost–benefit strategy against R. ferrugineus on date palms.",

The inducible histological alterations included: occlusion and collapsed follicles, disrupted cyst wall and necrotic spermatogenic elements. Ultrastructure changes implied abnormal chromatin condensation, ill-defined nuclear membrane, vacuolated cytoplasm, disintegrated nebenkern, deterioration of mitochondrial derivatives and degeneration of axonemes. In addition, agglutinated spermatids, and sperms with a double tail were noticed. The most noteworthy feature in spermatogonia and spermatocyte was the intra-tubular inclusion bodies. Histological and electron micrographs pointed out the structure of the parietal cell which functioned as a Sertoli cell. Adverse damage to these cells by ceramic pollution was reported.

    "abstract": "Malaria is a public health concern in Zimbabwe and its transmission varies geographically and seasonally, corresponding with the country's rainfall pattern. Information on density and distribution of malaria vectors, species composition, breeding sites and quality assurance of the spray programme is limited for Chiredzi District. This study investigated mosquito species composition and distribution during winter, blood meal sources of adult collections, characteristics of aquatic larval habitats and quality of spraying as well as the insecticide residual activity on sprayed walls. Anopheline larvae were collected from breeding habitats that were subsequently characterised. Adult anophelines were sampled from both inside human dwellings and outdoors. Mosquitoes collected were identified morphologically and further processed to sibling species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where necessary. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite proteins and multiplex PCR was used to detect blood meal source. WHO cone bioassays were conducted to monitor spray quality and insecticide residual activity on spayed walls. A total of 21 aquatic habitats were identified from which anopheline larvae were sampled. Of these, 9 (42.9 %) were classified as permanent, 7 (33.3 %) as seasonal and 5 (23.8 %) as temporal. Anopheles mosquitoes from both adult and larval collections totalled to 153, with the former collection method accounting for 69.9 % (107) and the latter for 31.1 % (46). The collected mosquitoes were identified as An. quadriannulatus and An. funestus respectively. Out of the blood-fed An. funestus females, 70 % (n = 10) had fed on human blood. None of the adult collected mosquitoes tested positive for P. falciparum circumsporozoite proteins. The aquatic habitats surveyed indicated that breeding sites were mainly man-made. Anopheles funestus was the only malaria vector recorded during this study. This species is a particularly efficient vector and its detection is a cause for concern. Furthermore, 70 % of the adult-collected An. funestus female specimens had fed on humans confirming this species' strong tendency toward anthropophagy. A more comprehensive and year-round investigation is essential to gather appropriate and relevant entomological indices on malaria transmission in Chiredzi so as to enable effective vector control.",

Larval mortality of the four species increased as concentration and exposure periods increased. Complete mortality was observed after 8 h. The LT50–99 values of ozone gas against the larvae decreased as concentration increased. Caterpillars were more sensitive to O3 than grubs. Data also showed that the effective effect of ozonation towards the four larval species indicated that not all insects had the same sensitivity to ozone gas. There was a significant increase in super oxide dismutase (SOD) levels in E. cautella and T. castaneum subjected to LT50 of ozone. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in nitric oxide concentration in both larvae after LT50 of ozone exposure. Ozone-treated larvae suffered from heterogeneous muscles with degenerated nuclei. The neurosecretory cells were found with accumulated neurosecretory materials. The neuropil glia appeared loose and vacuolated. Antenna appeared with loose sinus, and there were no artery nor trachea found. The mushroom body of brain calyces appeared with distributed Kenyon cells. The cuticular layer was degenerated.

    "abstract": "Culex pipiens (L.) has a wide distribution worldwide and is the main vector of many diseases. Mass rearing of all target vector mosquito species is frequently required for public health research and vector control. Vector mosquito species are anautogenous, they need vertebrate blood for egg production. Therefore, female blood feeding is essential for colonisation. Various artificial feeding methods have been developed over the years but they lack consistency. Thus, we have developed an artificial feeding technique for rearing and infection experiments as an attempt to establish a practical guide for vector research. Culex mosquitoes were fed directly and artificially; four blood sources (human, cattle, rat and pigeon) and three different membranes (chick, sausage casing and Parafilm-M®) were assessed based on feeding rate, fecundity, oviposition, egg hatchability and infectivity. The chick membrane was considerably more efficient than sausage casing and Parafilm-M. Using the chick membrane with different blood sources, feeding rates (FR) were 89.60 %, 86.20 %, 61.60 %, 50.40 % for human, cattle, rat and pigeon blood, respectively. There was statistically no significant difference in FR between cattle and human blood. Hepatitis C virus infection was carried out successfully using the artificial feeding technique with chick membrane. RT-PCR readings proved that Culex pipiens can harbour this virus for five days through the midgut region. Cattle blood with chick membrane in mosquito rearing is a good substitute for human blood and live feeding for its availability and cost effectiveness.

    "abstract": "The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick 1917) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is an invasive pest native to South America. Outside of its native range, it was first detected in Spain in 2006 and then rapidly spread to most tomato-growing regions in Central America, Europe, Africa and Asia where the species has become a major threat to tomato production. To implement appropriate policy and surveillance practices, to limit new introductions and spread, and inherent economic losses, better knowledge of its invasion pathways is required. To this end, a large sampling of T. absoluta was performed in native and invaded areas including European and for the first time many African countries. Samples were analysed using a mitochondrial marker (mtCOI) and a phylogenetic approach. Despite extensive sampling and sequencing efforts, an overall lack of genetic variation among the tested specimens (140) was observed. This striking finding may result from a combination of factors and phenomena such as extensive gene flow, severe bottlenecks, reproductive system and human activities, and will be discussed in the framework of biological invasion and pest management.",

    "abstract": "Three weed biological control (biocontrol) programmes are described, all of which are considered to be 'transfer projects' that were initiated elsewhere, and on which South Africa has piggybacked its biocontrol efforts. Using knowledge and expertise from international collaborators, South African weed researchers are following a long tradition of transfer projects, which has been a largely successful and practical approach to biocontrol. Two Brazilian weeds, the Brazilian pepper tree Schinus terebinthifolia and the spiderwort Tradescantia fluminensis are being targeted, along with the Old-World trees Tamarix ramosissima and T. chinensis. The potential biocontrol agents are described and ranked for the two trees according to what has been discovered elsewhere, while the agent already released against T. fluminensis is rated (as poor), and other potential agents are considered. The addition of molecular techniques, climate matching and remote sensing in transfer projects can increase the chance of successful biocontrol and the inclusion of these techniques in the three new programmes is discussed. Transfer projects are a cost-effective and pragmatic way to pick winning biocontrol programmes.",

    "abstract": "Vines and other climbing plants typically invest their resources into growth at the expense of accumulating self-supporting biomass. Adaptive traits that have arisen because of the life history needs of climbing species, such as rapid and extensive growth, as well as resilience to physical damage, make these plants highly competitive. Introduced climbing species therefore have the potential to be particularly damaging in novel ranges where they escape pressure from natural enemies. In South Africa, invasive climbing species negatively influence biodiversity and plant-community structure, and as conventional management is often difficult, biological control (biocontrol) is viewed as the only viable long-term control method. This paper consolidates the work done on biocontrol programmes against climbing species in South Africa, including Anredera cordifolia (Ten.) Steenis (Basellaceae), Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. (Sapindaceae), Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae) and Pereskia aculeata Miller (Cactaceae). To date, these programmes have investigated some 27 potential biocontrol agents, of which nine have been approved for release in the country. Since 2010, three new agents have been introduced, and considerable progress made with post-release evaluations of all the introduced agents. Some positive results have been achieved, most notably the successful reduction in seed set of C. grandiflorum due to Cissanthonomus tuberculipennis Hustache (Curculionidae), but considerable variation in efficacy over time and between infestations has been recorded for many of the other agents. Further work may help explain the factors limiting success, leading to improved control, but in some cases, such as for A. cordifolia, new biocontrol agents should be considered.",

The percentage of calling increased from 1- to 3-day-old females and decreased from 3- to 5-day-old females. The quantification of the hexane extracts of pheromone glands by gas chromatography (GC) revealed that the titre of (E,E)-10,12-hexadecadienal (E10E12-16Ald), in pheromone glands was well synchronized with female calling at different ages. The titre of the primary sex pheromone component peaked at the fourth hour into the scotophase. The sensitivity of male antenna to primary sex pheromone E10E12-16Ald (10 ng/µl) varied considerably with age, but no time-dependent difference in electroantennographic responses was found. The temporal pattern of male M. vitrata responding to sex pheromone gland extracts in the wind tunnel demonstrated that males became sexually mature on the third night, which also paralleled the calling activity of females. This study indicated that there existed distinct periodical variations in female calling, titre of the primary sex pheromone component, and male responsiveness in Maruca vitrata during scotophase. These three parameters were well synchronous and age-dependent.",

    "abstract": "The codling moth, Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a key pest of pome fruits in the Western Cape, South Africa. Up to 1993, the industry recommendation for commencement of the codling moth spray programme was at 75 % petal fall in order to avoid the negative impact of organophosphate sprays on bees during bloom. However, codling moth can emerge, mate and oviposit before and during full bloom in pome fruit orchards. Consequently, petal-fall does not necessarily correspond with the commencement of egg-laying or first egg hatch. The availability of insecticides with a softer environmental profile made it possible to apply sprays earlier than 75 % petal-fall. The development of phenology models provided a means of accurately predicting biological events such as the initiation of egg-laying and first egg hatch. Using lower and upper development thresholds of 10 °C and 32 °C, respectively, and hourly temperature recordings, phenology models were evaluated by comparing the number of degree-days (°D) accumulated using a selection of three biofixes, and date of first egg hatch. The number of °D accumulated from the selection of biofixes to first observed egg hatch varied from 130.7 to 179. The least variation in the number of °D between biofix and first egg hatch occurred when the second trap catch was used as the biofix. A biofix based on the first evening when the temperature reached or exceeded 17 °C at 18:00 after first trap catch also showed less variation than when the biofix was based on first trap catch. The mean number of °D at which 50 % of the moths of the first flight emerged was 166.6 °D, while the mean number of °D at which 50 % oviposition occurred was 290 °D following biofix. The number of °D between the second and third flight biofixes varied between 488.7 and 531.2 °D, with a mean of 508.1 °D. The results are of significance in improving the timing and reducing the number of insecticide sprays for codling moth control.",

Results showed that humidity significantly affected the toxicity of SeNPV against S. exigua larvae, and the LD50 (lethal dose 50 %) of SeNPV against S. exigua larvae was 1539.8 (60–70 % RH), 1110.4 (75–85 % RH) and 567.6 PIBs/g (90–100 % RH). The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POX) activities of S. exigua larvae were significantly lower in those subjected to high humidity than those in the control humidity group (60–70 % RH). The capacity of total antioxidant and hydroxyl radical scavenging decreased with the increasing of relative humidity. These results suggest that high RH may cause a decrease in the antioxidant system of S. exigua larvae, which may explain high RH is always associated with high mortality in insects due to infection with pathogens.",

The present study aimed to establish the influence of stalk rind hardness, fibre and nitrogen content, and the effect Fusarium species associated with E. saccharina infestation, on borer damage and performance in different sugarcane cultivars. In two glasshouse trials, larvae were inoculated into 7-month-old stalks of seven cultivars with different E. saccharina resistance ratings via wounds created in the rind. In one of the trials, E. saccharina-beneficial fungal strain Fusarium pseudonygamai SC17 and E. saccharina antagonistic F. sacchari PNG40 were inoculated into the stalk of N41 and NCo376 three weeks before larval inoculation. Rind hardness and fibre content were higher in resistant cultivars and mature stalk parts, whilst nitrogen content was lower in these genotypes and in older tissues. However, E. saccharina survival, damage and growth indicators were not entirely consistent with known resistance ratings of cultivars, possibly due to the absence of the rind effect owing to mechanical wounding and differential effects of fibre and nitrogen in the cultivars. The absence of rind protection did not affect resistance in N29 and N33 upper internodes. Fusarium infection was higher in the bottom of the stalk compared to the top in both N41 and NCo376. The least length bored was exhibited in the bottom internodes of NCo376 (3.3 cm) and N41 (1.7 cm) infected with PNG40, whilst SC17-colonized NCo376 stalks experienced the most damage (8.2 cm). The contribution of stalk rind hardness, fibre and nitrogen content to E. saccharina resistance in sugarcanemayvary in different cultivars and stalk parts, whilst biochemical defences possibly play a larger role in some genotypes. Infection by Fusarium species, especially in lower internodes,mayhave variable effects on resistance to the borer depending on the fungal strain present.",

The family is composed of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70). In the present study, to investigate whether the Hsp70 family plays an important role in the thermotolerance of Bombyx mori (silkworm), we analysed the expression of the Hsp70 family before and during heat shock in the midgut of three strains, including a thermotolerant strain cs-10, a thermosensitive strain cs-11, and cs-7, a thermotolerant near isogenic line of cs-11. qRT-PCR and Northern blot analyses revealed that, before heat shock, there was no significant difference in the expression of the selected four Hsp70 family members (Hsp70B, Hsp68, Hsc70-4 and Hsc70-3) among the three strains. Interestingly, after a heat shock of 2 h at 40 °C, increased expression of the selected four members was observed in all three strains, suggesting they are all inducible and involved in thermotolerance. Remarkably their expression, especially that of Hsp70B and Hsp68, was positively correlated with basal thermotolerance. After a heat shock of 8 h at 40 °C, there was no significant difference in the transcript level of Hsc70-3 between cs-10 and c-11. However, its transcript levels in both strains were still significantly higher than its pre-shock levels, indicating that Hsc70-3 may play an important role in long-term basal thermotolerance by working with other proteins yet to be identified. Unexpectedly, transcript levels of Hsp68, Hsc70-3 and Hsc-4 were found to be higher in cs-7 than in cs-10. A hypothesis is proposed to explain these results.",

    "abstract": "Aphid landing rates, species composition and abundance on lucerne (Medicago sativa), maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) were determined in a small-scale field trial to identify potential crops as prospective border plants for seed potatoes to reduce the spread of Potato virus (PVY) in South Africa. Aphids were sampled using green bucket traps to estimate aphid landing rates, whereas leaf counts and sweep-netting were used to identify colonizing species. Of the 34 species or species groups collected with green bucket traps, 18 were previously known vectors of PVY. The most abundant vector species or species groups were Acyrthosiphon pisum, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Metopolophium dirhodum, Myzus persicae, Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion spp. The only other species that occurred in high numbers, but whose vector status is unknown, were Acyrthosiphon kondoi and Tetraneura fusiformis. Landing patterns suggest that A. kondoi, A. pisum and M. dirhodum may be able to discriminate between plant species and select their preferred host plant, if available within a habitat patch, in the pre-alighting phase, whereas other species such as R. padi seemed less selective. Results on aphid landing together with colonization of the crops evaluated suggest that maize and wheat show the highest potential as possible crop border plants in regions where aphids colonizing Poaceae, and lucerne in regions where aphids colonizing Fabaceae are abundant. Soybean appears to be less suitable because cultivars with a high trichome density, which reduces colonization by aphids, are preferentially planted in South Africa.",

The effects of 40 to 70 Gy radiation and cold treatments of 0.6 °C to 7.0 °C for periods of 10 to 22 days by themselves and in combination, were investigated on mature larvae in artificial rearing diet. It was demonstrated that various combinations of the two methods can act together to potentially provide adequate control, with the prospect of moderated fruit quality effects due to the reduced intensity of the component treatments. A combination treatment consisting of 60 Gy followed by 16 days at 2.5 °C was identified for further evaluation as a combination treatment that could potentially be validated at the probit-9 level of efficacy.",

Since 1985 a new order has been discovered in the region (Mantophasmatodea; Klass et al. 2002) and there have been various rearrangements between closely-related groups that have resulted in orders being combined (Blattodea and Isoptera into Blattodea; Inward et al. 2007; Psocoptera and Phthiraptera into Psocodea; Grimaldi & Engel 2005) while others have been subsumed in larger groups (Hemimerina in Dermaptera; Kocarek et al. 2013). Furthermore, until quite recently Thysanura was the ordinal name used for silverfish or fishmoths but the group is now considered to beparaphyletic with Meinertellidae included; the latter has been moved to the Archaeognatha (Grimaldi & Engel 2005). Zygentoma was the suborder that included all other thysanurans so it became the default name for the order. Numerous major family-level changes in several large orders have also taken place; the most important being: Coleoptera - Beutel & Leschen 2005, but modified as in the in press revision of the book; Diptera - partially according to Anorim & Yeates 2006; also Kirk-Spriggs & Sinclair in press/in prep; Lepidoptera - based largely on Nieukerken et al. 2011; Hymenoptera - bees, Michener 2007, wasps, Pulawski 2012.",

Ten trials were planted on previous wattle sites. Monthly collections of whitegrubs that attacked seedlings were conducted during the first year of seedling growth. Very stressed or dying wattle seedlings and their surrounding roots were dug out and the soil was assessed to collect any whitegrub pests that caused seedling mortality. A multivariate analysis was used to rank the average abundance of the various whitegrub species that attacked wattle. The individual contribution of whitegrub species to the average similarity within a community and the dissimilarity between communities were tested with similarity percentages comparisons. The best two-dimensional (2-D) model obtained for each species pattern of distribution and relative abundance had a good ordination (stress value: 0.07). From a complex of 13 whitegrub pests found, six whitegrub species (Pegylis sommeri, Schizonycha affinis, Adoretus ictericus, Schizonycha fimbriata, an undescribed Maladera sp. 2 and an unknown species M8), with an average cumulative abundance of 96.4 %, were confirmed to have a high pest status. They accounted for the community structure pattern in the black wattle growing areas of KwaZulu-Natal. The remaining seven species, Heteronychus licas, undescribed Maladera sp. 1, and M5, M10, M11, M12 and M13 (all unknown species), contributed only 3.6 % to the average cumulative abundance and were considered to be minor pests within the whitegrub community structure.",

Emergence of adult parasitoids from galls collected during the 1994 austral summer indicated that levels of parasitism were low (0.6 %) and had not increased from previous years. Inspections of immature T. acaciaelongifoliae within galls showed that the incidence of parasitism was much higher (8.6 %) than was deduced from adult emergence. Levels of parasitism varied from 0 % to 21.3 % at four different localities. Most parasitoids were found in chambers located close to the surface of the gall, irrespective of gall size or the numbers of chambers per gaU, and only a small proportion of the occupants of deep-seated chambers were parasitized. There were no parasitoids in the galls until late-November, by which time adult emergence of T. acaciaelongifoliae was well advanced. Consequently, T. acaciaelongifoliae is protected, both by its physical position and by its asynchronized phenology, from the generalist parasitoids it has acquired, and the wasp persists as an important biological control agent of A. longifolia in South Africa.",

Opuntia stricta has no useful attributes but O. ficus-indica is extensively exploited as fodder for livestock and fruit for human consumption. Biological control of Opuntia weeds has not been attempted in North Africa for fear that introduced agents could deplete the valued resources provided by O. ficus-indica. Recent confirmation that there are at least two distinct biotypes of Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell), each specific to particular groups of Opuntia species, has enhanced prospects of O. stricta being controlled biologically with no threat to O. ficus-indica. One biotype of D. opuntiae, referred to as the 'stricta' biotype, only survives on low-growing species such as O. stricta while the other, the 'ficus' biotype, is associated with tree-like cacti, including O. ficus-indica. The 'stricta' biotype has been used with considerable success for biological control of 0. stricta in Australia for over 60 years. To corroborate the contention that the 'stricta' biotype of D. opuntiae could be used specifically to control O. stricta, with no threat to tree-like opuntias, the development and survival of the insects was monitored on several cultivars of O. ficus-indica, including the feral, spiniferous form and six spineless forms, Robusta, Fusicaulis, American Giant, Gymno Carpo, Algerian and Morado. The study showed that, with one possible exception, the O. ficus-indica varieties were unsuitable hosts for the 'stricta' biotype of D. opuntiae and demonstrated that the insects could be used with safety for biological control of O. stricta in North Africa.",

The exclusion of ants from branches of Leucadendron laureolum (Lam.) Foure., L. conocarpodendron and M. fimbriifolius did not lead to increased levels of herbivory, as might be expected if these extrafloral nectaries function as attractants to ant-guards. In view of low ant numbers and levels of herbivory recorded in this study, we suggest that such a mutualism may still operate under different ecological conditions to those prevailing in our study. Alternatively, the nectaries may not reduce herbivory but could serve another ecological function.",

In scarabaeid assemblages of winter rainfall regions with a short dry season (southern France, southeastern Australia), coprine species greatly outnumber scarabaeines, whereas in winter rainfall regions with a long dry season, there are equal numbers of coprine and scarabaeine species (western Australia, South Africa). In the scarabaeid fauna of the South African winter rainfall region, contrasting compositional trends are shown by the main biogeographical groups. In the predominantly spring-active group, comprising species that are endemic or largely restricted to the winter and bimodal (spring and autumn) rainfall regions, scarabaeine species greatly outnumber coprines. By contrast, in the predominantly summer­ active group of species which is widespread in the winter, bimodal and adjacent summer rainfall regions, coprine species greatly outnumber scarabaeines, a pattern characteristic of assemblages in summer rainfall and tropical regions throughout the rest of Africa. The cross-climatic changes in composition of the South African dung beetle fauna result from different responses to climate by the two subfamilies. In the Scarabaeinae, abundance and species richness are largely similar from summer to winter rainfall climates whereas those of Coprinae decline steeply across the same climatic range. These different climatic responses may be related to the lower incidence of warm, moist conditions in the winter rainfall region.",

    "abstract": "Natural habitat is under increasing pressure from urbanization. Urban and suburban areas are therefore growing in significance as elements of the matrix within which conservation must be undertaken. The ability of such areas to maintain biodiversity may be assessed using biological indicators. However, the robustness of such bioindicators must be established by independent tests of initially identified patterns and relationships, i.e. by repeating studies at different times and localities. Here, the utility of a Lepidoptera assemblage inhabiting fungus-induced galls, as a bioindicator of habitat quality in urban areas, is reassessed. Marked differences were found in gall resources, as well as Lepidoptera larval abundances and species rank abundances between studies. These were attributed to weather and phenological differences between years. Although assemblage structure and species composition is highly dependent on gall resource quality and quantity and the latter differed significantly between studies, habitat-associated differences in the lepidopteran assemblage were consistent between studies. Species richness, larval density and larval abundance were generally lower at sites closest to the city centre than at those further away. Larval abundance and density was significantly lower at roadside sites than at rural and suburban garden sites. This study has thus shown that this lepidopteran assemblage is a robust bioindicator, and also re-emphasized the importance of green areas for conserving diversity in cities and urban environments.",

    "abstract": "The KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service is undertaking a long-term project to determine the value of untransformed land for biodiversity conservation, to mapthese areas in accordance with their relative values, and to identify and prioritize irreplaceable areas. The overall goal of the initial stage of the project was to use existing data and expertise to define areas of conservation importance in KwaZulu-Natal. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the procedures used to incorporate insect species and subspecies into the project, including those for identifying insects of conservation concern and for making a first assessment of their distribution and conservation status. A biodiversity hierarchy (from landscapes through ecosystems and communities to species and populations) forms the basis of the analysis. Information received from taxonomists working in South Africa in response to a questionnaire survey was used to choose the species for inclusion in the initial analysis. A total of thirty-seven species and subspecies endemic to the Province in certain families of Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Mecoptera and Odonata were included. Existing distribution data were collated and the potential distributions of the endemics were modelled at a scale of 4 ha. Factors that potentially influence the distributions of the endemics were gleaned from the literature. Database queries using distribution data with a spatial resolution of ≤ 250 m and cartographic overlays formed the basis of the modelling procedure. Two areas with little or no statutory protection, the high-lying grasslands of the northwestern region and much of the central region of the Province, are predicted to have a relatively high diversity of endemic insects. Fifty-one percent of the insect species and subspecies in the analysis met the two conservation goals, i.e. 1) at least 10 % of their present distributions under formal conservation management, and 2) three such protected areas with viable populations. A benefit of modelling the potential distributions of endemics is that searching for populations of these insects can be directed to areas where they are expected to occur. The data collected can then be used to improve the distribution models for these insects, some of which are poorly known. The distributions and their associated conservation targets format vital component of the iterative systematic conservation planning project currently underway in the Province.",

    "abstract": "Helicoverpa armigera is one of the major pests of cotton crops. Bt-cotton, (transgenic cotton) that contains cry genes from Bacillus thuringiensis, was introduced as a control measure against Heliothis virescens in the U.S.A. Cry genes encode for toxins that are toxic to lepidoteran pests. The effect of Bt-cotton (cv. NuOpal) on H. armigera population numbers and egg parasitism was investigated. Scouting was conducted once a week over two cotton-growing seasons at a cotton farm near Marble Hall. The number of damaged bolls, bollwormeggs and larvae were determined in non-Bt- (cv. Delta Opal) and Bt-cotton fields. No pesticides were used during the first season. A sprayed non-Bt cotton field was included in the second season's study. Pheromone traps baited with the sex pheromone of H. armigera were checked on a weekly basis to determine the number of adults in the fields under investigation. Bollworm eggs were collected during the second season to determine egg parasitism. The number of bollworm larvae and damaged cotton bolls were kept below threshold levels by the presence of the Bt-gene in the Bt-cotton fields and by insecticide applications in the non-Bt-cotton fields. Moth numbers, H. armigera oviposition and parasitoid emergence from bollworm eggs by Trichogrammatoidea lutea and Telenomus ullyetti were not influenced by the presence of the Bt-gene. Bt-cotton can therefore be useful in an integrated pest management programme under an irrigation system, because it resulted in a reduction in the number of insecticide applications per season and did not affect the biological control agents T. lutea and T. ullyetti.",

The larva is xylophagous, and occurs in a limited area of the Western Cape, in the Eerste River and Leopard's Kloof stream in the Hottentots Holland mountains. Association with E. capicola is assured by a distinctive (pharate) pupa visible within one mature larva, and the co-occurrence of larvae and diagnostic pupal exuviae in soft immersed wood. The characteristic mentum of Elpiscladius resembles that of Xylotopus Oliver, a Nearctic wood-mining genus, but other features including the dorsal head sclerites and the simple SI seta differ. Although phylogeny predicted the larval biology, addition of 17 larval features for Elpiscladius to that data matrix destroyed the relationship with Austrobrillia Freeman, reducing the Brillia group essentially to a polytomy. Larvae of Elpiscladius co-occur with the immature stages of an undescribed species of Stenochironomus (s.s.) Kieffer. Both these rare xylophagous taxa indicate clean flowing waters with intact native riparian vegetation, and thus can be regarded as biodiversity and environmental conservation indicators.",

The original specimens on which Greathead based his 1958 larval description of C. cuthbertsoni Duda, have been located and examined and are here ascribed to C. simile, rather than C. saheliense as previously assumed, based on examination of the type specimens of both. An additional larva, also reared from locust egg pods in northern Nigeria, is tentatively ascribed to C. saheliense and is described using SEM techniques, despite its relatively poor state of preservation. The two species are shown to be separable based on the relative lengths and widths of the mouthooks and intermediate sclerite of the cephaloskeleton and in the degree of expansion of semi-circular cuticular folding adjacent to the anal opening on the anal pad. A diagnosis of the immature stages of the genus Curtonotum Macquart is provided and the larval and puparial features of C. saheliense and C. simile are compared to the puparium of the Nearctic species C. helvum (Loew), the other species of the genus for which the immature stages are partially known. The composition and homologies of caudal tubules are discussed, as are features in common between the three species under discussion, and tentative comparison is made of the known immature stages of Curtonotum to those of the known larvae of other families of the Ephydroidea, as additional larval features are now discernible for the Curtonotidae. It is concluded that the larval morphology of the Curtonotidae is generally close to the putative groundplan of the Ephydroidea and are probably most closely allied to the Drosophilidae and Camillidae. The relative length of abdominal compartments six and seven is probably an autapomorphy of the family.",

Many endangered species are in the family Lycaenidae and have a more-or-less obligate relationship with a particular species of ant. An ecosystem capable of hosting such butterfly species must also be able to sustain substantial populations of the host ant. The Brenton blue, Orachrysops niobe, is one of the most endangered South African butterflies, and is known only from one site in the Western Cape. Ant assemblages were investigated at this site and two other ecologically similar sites where the host plant of O. niobe, Indigofera erecta, also occurs, but O. niobe was absent. The ant assemblages differed significantly, with the host ant of O. niobe, Camponotus baynei, only occurring at the Brenton site where the butterfly was breeding. Vegetation composition, structure and microclimate differed at the three sites and these appear to be key factors in determining the ant assemblages that a site will support. The two sites where C. baynei was absent had a history of recent fire, which contributed to the vegetation changes and deprived the ant of dead wood for nesting. The invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, was not detected at any of the study sites, and the reasons for this are discussed.",

This study was conducted to determine flight activity patterns as well as preferred oviposition sites of lacewings on maize plants to facilitate time-effective searching for eggs. The daily flight activity pattern and flight height of lacewings were recorded and sweep-net samples were taken to determine lacewing numbers in different adjacent vegetation types (maize, lucerne, natural veld). The preferred area of oviposition was determined by inspecting maize plants for lacewing eggs and recording the distribution of eggs on leaves. Chrysoperla pudica (Navás) was the predominant species in maize. Lacewings were most active between 16:00 and 22:00 and flew largely between 0.5 and 2.5 m above ground level. Oviposition occurred predominantly on leaves near maize ears. Data on spatial distribution of eggs facilitate monitoring of eggs numbers in maize cropping systems and is also of use in general pest management.",

    "abstract": "The cuticular hydrocarbons of the fourth-instar larvae of Culex pipiens aged one and six days were analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effect of an insect growth regulator (halofenozide = RH-0345) on the cuticular hydrocarbons was evaluated using newly moulted fourth-instar larvae of C. pipiens, at the lethal concentrations (LC50 = 12.58 and LC90 = 28.58 µ/l). A previous study revealed that RH-0345 is toxic to larvae of C. pipiens by induction of precocious larval moulting. Several cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) were identified and many of the other compounds remained unknown. Our data show that the CHC classes consisted of n-alkanes (C23-C29) and differed quantitatively between larval ages. Significant quantitative differences in the distribution of the hydrocarbons of different chain lengths were observed. Amounts of the CHCs of the treated larvae were shifted towards longer-chain alkanes compared to untreated larvae. Typically, treatment with halofenozide decreased significantly the amounts of the major cuticular hydrocarbons of the larvae for the two lethal concentrations, at day 1 and 6. These results provide background data for further studies on the possible role of mosquito cuticular hydrocarbons in chitin synthesis and to better understand the physiological action of halofenozide.",

    "abstract": "The false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick), has been reared successfully for many years in several small insectaries in South Africa (Schwartz 1971). Rearing was for various purposes, including research, production of the egg parasitoid, Trichogrammatoidea cryptophlebia Nagaraja (Schwartz 1977), and for commercial production of the false codling moth granulovirus, CrleGV (Moore 2002; Moore et al. 2004). The techniques commonly used were adequate for the scale on which rearing was conducted. In 2002 the South African citrus industry initiated research on the sterile insect technique for false codling moth control. As this project progressed it became apparent that the equipment previously used was inadequate for mass rearing false codling moth for commercial sterile insect technique purposes. A programme was launched to design new equipment that would allow for the production of 15 million insects per week. This equipment was installed in a new insectary, Xsit (Pty) Ltd, recently built in Citrusdal, South Africa, for the mass rearing of false codling moth. Amongst others, a moth collection system, using cyclonic separators, was installed. The technical principles in the use of cyclonic separators for particulate matter collection have often been described as in Griffin (1994). However, the development of this type of equipment specifically for the collection of mass-reared moths is poorly documented and often only relates to models suitable for insect collection on a relatively small or laboratory scale, for example Wolf & Stiemann (1971). The use of cyclonic separators in new rearing facilities is therefore probably based on working models in existing mass-rearing facilities.",

In an attempt to contain the spread of this noxious weed the South African authorities have supported the introduction of host-specific and damaging seed-feeding biocontrol agents. In order to increase seed losses caused by existing agents, surveys were undertaken in Argentina and a seed-feeding weevil Coelocephalapion gandolfoi Kissinger (Coleoptera: Brentidae: Apioninae) identified. Aspects of the biology and the host range of this seed-feeding weevil were studied in Argentina and South Africa to evaluate its potential as a biocontrol agent. The period from oviposition to adult emergence was c. 40 days. The duration of the stages was: 11–20 days for eggs, 25–40 days for larvae, and 6–16 days for pupae. Field surveys found that the beetle was responsible for 51 % of the seed damage on P. flexuosa. The host range of C. gandolfoi was restricted to Prosopis species in the section Algarobia. Oviposition and feeding preference for Prosopis species native to Argentina and P. glandulosa from North America was very high. We consider C. gandolfoi to be a good candidate for the biological control of invasive Prosopis species in South Africa.",

All populations showed resistance against malathion and significantly higher activities of insecticide detoxifying enzymes were recorded as compared to the susceptible population (control). This higher enzymatic activity and elevated levels of GSTs and monooxygenases is the possible reason for malathion resistance in P. americana. However, non-specific esterases and monooxygenases might be involved in the development of resistance in other populations at the same localities. The development of the resistance mechanism was noticed in all tested populations of P. americana and it is an indication to replace malathion insecticides against American cockroaches in the investigated regions especially, and also a warning for other regions in the world.",

The present study shows, on the contrary, higher mosquito aggressiveness and an increase in malaria transmission in a district of Douala where alpha-cypermethrin impregnated mosquito nets were recently distributed.Asurvey of the coverage and utilisation of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) was conducted in February 2016 in the Youpwé district. Night catches of adult mosquitoes on human volunteers were carried out prior to (January 2016) and after (March 2016) alpha-cypermethrin impregnated mosquito nets distribution, in and outside eight randomly selected houses in the Youpwé district. Mosquitoes were identified according to morphological and molecular criteria. The physiological age of mosquitoes was determined according to the Detinova method. Vectors' infectivity was determined by the ELISA CSP test. Long-lasting insecticidal nets coverage and utilisation rates in the Youpwé district were 95.2%and 90 %, respectively. Overall, 3923 mosquitoes were collected within 32 man-night catches. Anopheles coluzzii (24.8 %, n=973) and Culex quinquefasciatus (75.2 %; n=2950) were the only species aggressive to humans. The biting rate was significantly higher after ITN distribution (P=0.024). The aggressiveness cycles were similar during the two phases of the study with a peak of activity between 22:00 and 00:00. The physiological age and infectivity of An. coluzzii were significantly lower before the distribution of ITNs (P <0.004). Poor effectiveness of alpha-cypermethrin impregnated mosquito nets at a dose of 200 mg/m2, added to first rainfalls, are the likely causes of the significant increase in aggressiveness and malaria transmission.",

    "abstract": "The tropical ichneumonid wasps are poorly sampled, particularly in the Old World, despite their ecological importance and high species richness. Existing inventories also tend to have had a taxonomic focus, with trap placement reflecting the need for maximal sample size rather than rigorous ecological comparisons. Here, we report the results of an intensive sampling effort at Kibale National Park, Uganda, carried out with randomised trap locations. We sampled ichneumonid faunas for a year (2011–2012) with Malaise traps, in eight successional sites ranging from clear-cut exotic plantations to primary rainforest. The traps were situated in 10 random locations at each site and were moved between locations once a week. The total sampling effort encompassed 231 trap months (using traps smaller than the standard size), one of the largest we know of from a single Afrotropical location.We sorted the collected ichneumonids into subfamilies and investigated whether their community composition differed between the sites. Ichneumonid faunas differed between forest and former plantation sites, with both the overall difference and that of four subfamilies significant. Our sample size was unexpectedly small (1212 individuals), but we estimate that the model-based analyses we used could still have given a significant result with a smaller (954 individuals) sample. Overall, randomly placed Malaise traps detected ecological patterns in Afrotropical ichneumonid distributions. Our data also showed that there is a rich and at least partly undescribed ichneumonid fauna still awaiting discovery in the Afrotropical rainforests. Future inventories of this fauna may, however, have to compromise on objective random trap placement in order to get a large sample size.",

Unfortunately, intensification of agricultural practices has led to a simplification of habitat and subsequent loss of native ant biodiversity. This paper describes an evaluation of the ants present in a Rwandan coffee plantation. The plantation was unshaded, intensively managed and regularly treated with pesticides. No herbicides or fertilisers were used, although the area had been mulched. Only five ant species were found in the plantation (Pheidole megacephala, Lepisiota depressa, Nesomyrmex angulatus and Camponotus (Myrmosericus) spp. (2 spp.). Pheidole megacephala dominated the plantation and occurred on 94 % of trees, while L. depressa, C. (Myrmosericus) spp. and N. angulatus each occurred on 13 % or less of trees. Pheidole megacephala and L. depressa were negatively associated, whereas C. (Myrmosericus) spp. were positively associated with L. depressa. Association between the coffee pests and ant species was not significant. We conclude that intensification of coffee production in this plantation and domination by P. megacephala has contributed to the low diversity of ants present and that those species that do occur there are not particularly efficient at reducing pest densities.",

Four species of chewing lice are previously known to infest P. haliaetus. The nestlings of the osprey in Farasan were only infested by Colpocephalum turbinatum Denny, 1842. This species of chewing lice is recorded herein for the first time from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its distributional pattern is very characteristic among three different avian orders (Accipitriformes, Columbiformes, and Strigiformes). Colpocephalum turbinatum was found mainly on terrestrial birds of the order Columbiformes and it may be transferred to predatory birds in the other two orders, but the presence of this parasite on some aquatic birds of prey like osprey may indicate that the ancestors of these birds were terrestrial hunters that acquired this louse from their prey such as doves and pigeons before their transference to aquatic life. The pattern of chewing lice distribution through their host populations and habitats may reveal some important ecological and evolutionary events that happened to their hosts in the past.",

In the present study, the interaction between spinosad and Bacillus thuringiensis, using different pairings, in third and fifth instar larvae was determined. Activities of α- and β-non-specific esterases and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were also determined. Additionally, AChE transcript abundance using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was detected. The cumulative percentage mortality of S. littoralis, third and fifth instar larvae, to spinosad and B. thuringiensis were increased gradually by increasing the concentrations. Spinosad was more potent than B. thuringiensis. Sequential application of these bio-insecticides, on the LC25 level on third and fifth instar larvae, when spinosad was first applied, showed synergistic interaction and additive effect, respectively. On the other hand, when B. thuringiensis was first applied, using the same timing of application, additive interaction was observed for both third and fifth instars. Individual, simultaneous and sequential applications of these bio-insecticides induced variable changes in α- and β-esterases and AChE activities. Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed an increase in transcript abundance up to 2.0-fold in third instar larvae in case of sequential and simultaneous applications. Based on the results herein, integrated pest management programme using spinosad and B. thuringiensis can be successfully developed for the control of S. littoralis.",

    "abstract": "Use of the sterile insect technique (SIT) targeting the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis has been proposed and is currently under investigation. The SIT requires production of large numbers of sterile males and therefore mass-rearing of the target species is required. One critical factor during mass-rearing for sterile releases is the need to synchronise developmental life stages to assist in pupae and adult harvesting during production. However, by nature An. arabiensis egg hatching, and subsequent development is staggered as a survival strategy resulting in unsynchronised production. This causes a loss in efficiency during mass-rearing. This study aimed to investigate the effect of egg storage on egg hatch synchronisation, survival rate of aquatic life stages and the subsequent effect on production lead-time of a laboratory-reared An. arabiensis strain. Eggs from colonised An. arabiensis were collected, drained onto a filter paper to remove excess water, and stored for an increasing number of days, up to four days. After the storage time, proportion hatching and pupating as well as the time to hatch and pupation were measured and analysed using a one-way ANOVA and a Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the proportion hatching or pupating between the different storage durations. However, there was a significant reduction in time to hatch and pupate. In conclusion, egg storage is a viable method to synchronise hatching, which could, in combination with other factors, assist in synchronous production of pupae for this strain without having adverse effects on survival.",

    "abstract": "The larvae of Tuta absoluta are harmful leafminers that attacks different solanaceous plants such as tomato, potato, colour pepper, eggplant and many others. The life tables of a population are important to control pests because they give the most comprehensive description of the growth, survival and fecundity. Life tables of T. absoluta reared on tomato, potato and eggplant in the laboratory were determined and analysed using the age-stage, two-sex life tables. Developmental periods of eggs, larvae, pupae and adults, and pre-oviposition and oviposition periods of T. absoluta fed as larvae on tomato, potato or eggplant were estimated. Fecundity of a female fed on the same three hosts was 198.3, 172.2 and 133.7 eggs/female, respectively. Life table parameters such as the net reproductive rates (R0) (92.25, 76.25 and 67.82 days), the mean generation time (T0) (31.96, 36.06 and 36.94 days), the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) (0.142, 0.117 and 0.113/day) and the finite population increase (λ) (1.15, 1.12 and 1.12/day) were obtained for T. absoluta fed on tomato, potato and eggplant, respectively. The shortest doubling time (DT) was obtained with tomato leaves (4.9 ± 0.06 days), while the longest DT was obtained with eggplant leaves (6.30 ± 0.08 days). Based on the results herein, it appears that the development and reproductive potentiality of T. absoluta depends on its host plant; this pest can therefore be more dangerous to its suitable host (tomato) than other hosts.",

    "abstract": "Globally Helicoverpa armigera, a polyphagous pest of many economic crops, has developed resistance to almost all groups of insecticides presently in used for its control. In cotton, its larvae cause severe damage and feeds on all plant parts including young leaves, square, flowers and bolls which in turn cause economic damage. Recent reports on development of its resistance to transgenic cotton which has Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (Bt cotton) has given an indication of future threat to cotton growers. Therefore, use of semiochemicals as management strategy for these insects would be a great alternative as ethological pest management within insect pest management (IPM) to control this menace. These semiochemicals/volatile organic compounds can be present in insect (egg, larva, female) as well as in the host plant. In the present study, a total of seven volatiles have been identified from methanol extract of eggs and faecal pellets, out of which two volatiles; methyl ester of octadecanoic acid (methyl stearate) and methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid (methyl palmatate), were detected in egg samples. From faecal pellets five volatiles were identified namely octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) and its methyl ester, hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) and its methyl ester, tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid), caryophyllene and its oxide, phytol. Interestingly, methyl ester of octadecanoic acid and methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid were detected in both the samples. Volatiles observed in common may be used as effective semiochemicals in ethological pest management of Helicoverpa armigera. However, further study is needed to validate the competency of these fatty acids under field conditions.",

Correlation between heavy metals and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a biomarker was also examined.

The highest mean values of AChE activity were noted in honey bees sampled from SB and KR followed by AQ and AR. However, AChE was found to positively correlate significantly with Zn.

In the present study, we evaluate the impact of urbanisation on the picture-winged flies (family Ulidiidae) communities in Wadi El-Natroun Depression, by assessing the changes in abundance and diversity. Six sites, each measuring about 2.1 ha, were determined: three sites (A1, A2, A3) are in an open area out of the city, and three sites (B1, B2, B3) are on the periphery of the city surrounded by inhabited buildings and assumed to suffer from anthropogenic activities (urbanised sites). The fly sampling was conducted monthly from January to December 2015 using sweep nets. Total abundance and species diversity of ulidiids in open sites were significantly higher than in urbanised sites. A similar population trend was recorded for Physiphora alceae (Preyssler) and Physiphora smaragdina (Loew). These species appear in early spring and increase gradually but were almost eliminated by the beginning of the fall. A bimodal seasonal profile was observed with two peaks of Ulidia fascialis Hendel density: April and July. The correlation between species abundance and temperature was positive, but it was only significant with P. alceae in the urbanised area and with P. smaragdina in the open area. In contrast, an inverse correlation was recorded between species abundance and relative humidity; however, it was only significant with P. alceae in open and urbanised areas. A scatter plot generated from a principal component analysis (PCA) of species abundance showed a clear grouping of the study sites based on whether they were open or urbanised. The results of the present study showed that the picture-winged flies were directly affected by the habitat changes related to urbanisation. Both species abundance and diversity were dramatically reduced in the urbanised area. Consequently, these flies could be potential habitat quality indicators.",

Two forms of cloves were applied, first as finely powdered flower buds and later as an essential oil. The clove powder concentrations used against the larvae were 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 %, and the clove essential oil (CEO) was used at concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 %. The highest (68.5 %) and lowest (2 %) larval mortality were caused by 9 % and 1 % clove flower bud powder (CFBP), respectively. However, the CEO was more effective against the larvae of O. agamemnon than the powder. Mortalities ranged from 12.5 to 87.9 % at oil concentrations of 1 and 5 %, respectively. The results also showed that the two forms of cloves persist in the treated soil for 7 to 8 days. Additionally, the clove oil and powder have a residual effect in treated soil that provides sustainable protection for date palms against root borers. Accordingly, it was concluded that cloves in either powder or essential oil form are very promising for controlling Oryctes larvae. These results indicate that clove flower buds and essential oils are desirable tools for crop protection in the future, promoting environmentally friendly pest control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Control of arthropod pests on indigenous flower crops often has particular challenges. Here we investigate the arthropod species associated with indigenous cultivated Protea species and cultivars in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. Arthropod individuals were collected from various commercial varieties of protea as well as from wild protea plants. Arthropod individuals were recorded directly on plants in the field (for disturbance-sensitive species), as well as from specific plant parts carefully enclosed in plastic bags and taken to the laboratory. Of the arthropod morphospecies recorded, 95.9 % were insects, and the rest mostly mites. A total of 37 % of the individuals could be identified to species level, along with 33 new species records of arthropods on protea plants. Taxonomically, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera were the most abundant and speciose groups. Structurally complex plants and mixed stands of plant species harboured the most arthropod species. Morphospecies were sorted into guilds, as determined by previous studies. In general, guild structure reflected the complexity of structure of individual plants as well as the mixture of plant species and cultivars, with apparently strong natural enemy activity on complex plants and mixed groups. The free-living, flower visitor guild was the most abundant, with largely beetles contributing to this guild. Endophages were about equal in abundance across all cultivars but less on those with simple structures. From rank abundance curves, a total of 30 % of the arthropod species were categorized as abundant, with the rest (70 %) being rare. Most species were generalists on the various proteas, with some being species or cultivar specialists. A total of 7.26 % species recorded were major pests affecting commercial production of proteas in the CFR. This protea agroecosystem, being composed of plant types being grown in their general native area, resulted in about 93%of the arthropod species being restricted to the Proteaceae, with only 5.6%associated with other South African crops. Even though some of this arthropod assemblage is adverse for protea farming in theCFR, these commercial fields are nevertheless playing a role in biodiversity conservation in the fynbos. The wild proteas supported only intermediate arthropod abundance, suggesting strong, and probably complex, natural regulatory processes at work.",

Most of the insects were trapped during a period extending from mid-Spring (April) to early autumn (September). The highest numbers were trapped during July and August (87 % of the total). Two orders, Coleoptera and Diptera represented 97 % of all insects trapped. Beetles comprised 87.83 % of the total insects trapped with scarabs composing 73 % of this percentage. The fruit stalk borer Oryctes elegans comprised 58 % of that total. This species was exceptionally abundant in one of the orchards in August. Dipterans comprising 10 % of the total (4 701 individuals), was the only other order attracted in relatively large numbers to the light traps. Most of these flies were trapped during August.

Although the abundance of darkling beetles is used as an environmental bioindicator after locust control operations with chemical pesticides, an appropriate sampling technique taking into account their behavioural characteristics has not been developed. The present study investigated the effects of environmental factors, including the presence of bait, light, air and ground surface temperature, as well as humidity, on diurnal activity and sheltering behaviour of the darkling beetle, Pimelia senegalensis Olivier in the Sahara Desert. We compared the effectiveness of baited and unbaited pitfall traps, in terms of numbers and timing of beetle captures. Few beetles were trapped before dusk, irrespective of the presence of bait. The beetles started moving around dusk. The baited pitfall traps were found to be more effective than unbaited ones. Field-collected adults previously maintained in shade were exposed to either direct sunlight or shade for 30 min every two hours from 08:00 to 20:00. High mortality was observed only for the unshaded specimens between 12:00 and 14:00, when the ground surface temperature rose above 50 °C. Observation of the diurnal sheltering behaviour using a pipe refuge showed that P. senegalensis tended to shelter inside the pipe during daytime, coming out only after dusk. These results suggested that baited pitfall traps deployed after dusk were effective for sampling the beetles, in accordance with the nocturnality and sheltering behaviours of P. senegalensis that allow them to avoid lethal ground surface temperatures.",

In the present work, we have used COI barcoding to distinguish between three subspecies of A. fabae, frequently found in Tunisia, namely A. f. fabae, A. f. solanella and A. f. cirsiiacanthoidis. Results of our study revealed that COI barcoding was efficient to generate haplotypes discriminating A. f. fabae from the two remaining subspecies. Indeed, among seven haplotypes, identified and named H1–H7, five were found exclusively in A. f. fabae, one represented exclusively A. f. cirsiiacanthoidis, and one was shared by A. f. cirsiiacanthoidis and A. f. solanella. However, the differentiation of Aphis f. fabae from A. f. solanella and A. f. cirsiiacanthoidis was not further supported by a phylogenetic distinction, as it was revealed by neighbour-joining and maximum parsimony phylogenies. Such a coherent genetic structure of the A. fabae complex, not governed by the subspecies factor, as inferred from our present mitochondrial (mt)DNA data, is in agreement with previous analyses based on genomic DNA. Therefore, we hypothesize that the phenotypical and physiological processes having led to differentiation between subspecies would have arisen from weak selection pressures, thus resulting in little genetic change between subspecies. In combination with additional still-to-come data from additional markers, results of this study will be important to constitute a groundwork for pest integrated management.",

    "abstract": "The larval breeding sites of anopheline mosquitoes in eastern Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, were investigated. Using abiotic parameter data collected in the field, environmental conditions that correlate with larval community composition and productivity are reported. Twelve anopheline species were identified, with the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis Patton (Diptera: Culicidae) ranking as the second most abundant. There was a significant difference in the mean abundance of each species of anopheline from each of the geographically separate breeding sites (Kruskal-WallisANOVA, P<0.05, d.f.= 6,H 2 = 17.09). Anopheles merus Dönitz showed a significant positive correlation with salinity (Pearson's product moment, r = 0.971, P < 0.05). Habitats such as rain puddles, hoof prints and residual pools left after rivers recede were important breeding sites and these were characteristically short-lived, and fully or partially sunlit. Anopheles gambiae complex members from the breeding sites surveyed during this study were completely susceptible to the insecticides bendiocarb and deltamethrin that are used for vector control in the area, while An. merus showed possible resistance to DDT according to WHO criteria (<98 % mortality). Larval control operations should include all available breeding sites and focus efforts during the dry season when these areas are discrete.",

    "abstract": "Farnesol, at 0.06 × 104 ppm concentration was tested against the fifth nymphal instar of Locusta migratoria induced antifeedant activity by 33.6 % and 45 % to males and females, respectively. Ultrastructural studies, using transmission electron microscopy, revealed marked pathological changes in the neurosecretory cells in brain and corpora allata (CA) cells of treated nymphs. The brain neurosecretion was held inside the neurosecretory cells whose axons did not liberate normally, leading to the accumulation of neurosecretory granules inside. These cells appeared ruptured and irregular. Corpora allata cells had hypertrophied nuclei, numerous lysosomes, malformed mitochondria, Golgi bodies and some other intracellular organelles in the gland cells. Multivesicular bodies were scattered and intercellular spaces appeared within the cell matrix. The haemolymph testosterone and progesterone levels were significantly decreased in the fifth nymphal instar treated with farnesol. Moreover, haemolymph and brain superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly decreased in brains of treated males and females. On the other hand, haemolymph malondialdehyde (MAD) only declined. By contrast, the brain MDA level was significantly increased in farnesol-treated fifth nymphal instars of both sexes. The ultrastructural and biochemical changes reflect the sensitivity of L. migratoria to farnesol as a neurotoxin bioinsecticide. It appears that the changes in the biochemical macromolecules reflect the ultrastructural alterations obtained. Thus, farnesol can be used as a promising biocide against the migratory locusts as it could be mixed in bait traps in the integrated pest management programme (IPM).",

    "abstract": "The African maize stem borer, Busseola fusca, feeds on a limited number of host plant species (Calatayud et al. 2014), which include crops such as maize, pearl millet and sorghum. This pest occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa where it causes economic damage to maize and sorghum crops (Kfir et al. 2002). In an attempt to combat lepidopteran stem borers, genetically modified Bt maize that express insecticidal Cry toxins were developed to kill larvae that feed on these plants (George et al. 2011). Bt maize was introduced into South Africa during 1998 and within the first decade after release, field-evolved resistance of B. fusca to Bt maize was reported (Van Rensburg 2007). Since this first report, resistant populations have been reported from several parts of the maize-production region of South Africa (Kruger et al. 2011; Van den Berg et al. 2013). Explanations provided for this rapid resistance development were confined to agronomical reasons (VanRensburg 2007; Kruger et al. 2009, 2011),non-compliance to refuge requirements (Kruger etal. 2009) and non-recessive inheritance of resistance (Campagne et al. 2013). Notmuchis however understood about the molecular genetics of B.fusca. Previously, Sezonlin et al. (2006b) noted that limited population genetic and phylogeography data are available for B. fusca.",

    "abstract": "A literature survey was conducted on Lepidoptera that damage cultivated plants in South Africa, to estimate the present status of local lepidopteran pests and to highlight research priorities. A database was compiled from papers published between 1980 and 1994. Moran's (1983) formula for determining pest status was modified to provide a more objective assessment of the relative importance of the pest species. Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) ranks as the most important lepidopteran pest in South Africa. The pest status of Eldana saccharina Walker Tortrix capensana (Walker) and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) ranked higher than in Moran's (1983) assessment, whereas the pest status of Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) ranked substantially lower. Following global trends, the Noctuidae were found to be the most important lepidopteran pests in South Africa, and cosmopolitan and African lepidopteran pests were of greater importance than endemic species. Borers and cutworms were more important than defoliators and miners. Articles relating to extension services exceeded research papers, and 28 % of research publications appeared in international journals. The output was greatest on citrus and cereal crops, and the Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Crops published the most articles on lepidopteran pests during the period reviewed. A substantial amount of information on the control of lepidopteran pests in South Africa has been published, whereas only a few articles on yield loss, economic loss or pest distributions have appeared. Studies of yield loss and economic loss will improve the efficiency of pest management practices and will also facilitate the calculation of true pest status, and are identified as research priorities. The descriptionption and monitoring of pest distributions are also important in anticipating and mitigating the potential negative impact of climate change on agroecosystems.",

The insect was reared for 20 successive generations at 25 °C, 85 % RH and photoperiod 12 : 12 h. The larval stage lasted on average 27.6 days for males, and 28.5 days for females. The pupal stage lasted on average 13.4 days in both sexes, and mean total development time (egg to adult) was approximately 50 days. The mean pupation rate was 80 %. Adult emergence rate was 74 %, with a mean sex ratio of 1 : 0.9. Females laid an average of 514 eggs of which 52 % hatched. Additional experiments were conducted to develop techniques to improve oviposition by moths, and to manipulate larval, pupal and egg incubation times. Mating and hatching rates were similar with wooden-framed cages containing 35 males : 30 females and plastic, bottle cages with 4 males : 3 females used in the routine rearing. Pupation was delayed by 16 days when larvae were kept at 20 °C instead of 25 °C; adult emergence was delayed by 8-27 days when pupae were kept at 15 °C instead of 25 °C; and hatching of eggs was delayed by 3-7 days when eggs were kept at 15 °C for 7-9 days instead of 25 °C. Studies on larval diapause termination indicated that diapause could be manipulated to provide pupae and moths for use in the mass-rearing colony. The optimum pupation rate (70 %) was obtained by watering diapause larvae daily for six days (compared to 40 % pupation rate for larvae receiving no water), with pupae forming over a mean period of 12.3 days (compared to 43.9 days to pupation for larvae receiving no water).",

Furthermore, many of these introductions are likely to have occurred within the last 50 years. Such high rates of recent introductions constitute a significant conservation threat to the indigenous invertebrates and the island's biodiversity as a whole. In addition, endemic invertebrate species are amongst the prey of a non-invertebrate introduction, the house mouse (Mus musculus Linn.). In this paper, we review the present knowledge of the invertebrates of Gough, report on the preliminary observations of the ongoing Gough Island Terrestrial Invertebrate Survey, and discuss the implications of introduced species for the conservation of Gough Island's indigenous species.",

Infestation of maize and sorghum by larvae and pupae of Busseola fusca (Fuller) peaked from February to April, then declined rapidly when the crops matured during May. Larvae that infested the crops during January and February diapaused in winter as mature larvae, pupated by October and moths emerged during October and November. Larval parasitoids were active from February to May, with parasitism peaking at 40 % at the end of the growing season in May. Peaks of larval parasitism lagged about four weeks behind peaks of larval populations and were manifested when populations were declining. The most abundant larval parasitoid of B. fusca was Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which was active throughout the growing season and in spring. Pupal parasitoids were abundant only during the 1989/90 growing season, peaking at around 50 % parasitism during October. The most abundant pathogen of B. fusca was the nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV), which occurred throughout the growing season and in winter, and caused mortality during March to May that coincided with peak larval populations. Larval parasitoids, especially C. sesamiae, and microbial pathogens, especially NPV, were the major cause of the autumn decline in the larval populations of B. fusca. Timing of male moth flights of B. fusca, determined by the use of synthetic sex pheromone traps, was consistent, with three peaks each year. The first flight, which resulted from moths emerging from pupae that emanated from larvae that hibernated in spring, peaked around the middle of November, while the second and the third flights peaked around the middle of February and April, respectively.",

By contrast, abundance was highest in the cultivated fields with many common and widely distributed species. The abundance of species was more evenly distributed in the old fallow than in the other land-use types. Butterfly taxa differed in their response to land-use; some of these differences could be associated with a change in the flora. The sap-sucking nymphalids, in particular the Charaxes, were influenced by differences in land-use. There was a positive relationship between nymphalid abundance and woody canopy cover and between nymphalid and woody plant species numbers. Grazing intensity had little effect on the Charaxes fauna.",

Since the insect is known to feed on several host plants, a study was conducted on its host plant range to assess the role that weeds played in the pest status of this insect throughout the sunflower production area of South Africa. Roadside surveys of hosts, conducted in every quarter-degree grid of the sunflower production area, showed that N. natalensis was ubiquitous. The insect survived, developed and reproduced across a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions. Feeding of nymphs and adults, as well as the presence of eggs was observed on 26 plant species belonging to eight families. The polyphagous habits of N. natalensis, together with a favourable temperature range for development in its distribution area, are important factors in determining population density of the pest. Late-planted sunflowers were prone to N. natalensis damage because seed-fill coincided with high numbers of the insect that increased during spring and summer. These individuals migrated onto sunflower with senescence of host weeds prior to winter. Recommendations are made on weed management practices to limit damage by N. natalensis.",

Other less important pests are Gonocephalum simplex (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), Dysdercus fasciatus (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae) and Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Bunches of grapes in vineyards were sampled for all phytosanitary pests during the 2003/2004 season, by both direct inspection and by shaking individual bunches to collect insects that fell. Insects moving up the vine trunk were collected with cardboard collars. The heads and bases of vines were also inspected. Cover crops and surrounding habitats were sampled by sweep netting. Pheromone traps, using E. acerbella pheromone capsules, were placed in vineyards. Abundance of pests was related to presence or absence of sticky trunk barriers, use of DiPel® (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki), mean rainfall and maximum temperature, height and type of cover crop. The effects of surrounding habitats, time of day pests were active and the time of year they were found was also evaluated. Use of Plantex® trunk barriers gave effective preventive control of P. callosus. DiPel® was effective against E. acerbella larvae. Numbers of P. callosus weevils increased after periods of high ambient temperatures, while E. acerbella numbers decreased following rainfall. Most phytosanitary pests infested vineyards from adjacent vineyards, with few pests recorded in cover crops or in surrounding uncultivated habitats.

During summer adult M. diplopterus move from their host plants, usually wheat, to find shelter for aestivation, and may settle on fruit, sheltering at the stalk and calyx ends. Grain chinch bugs are endemic to the Western Cape region of South Africa, but their distribution and abundance in the fruit-growing areas of this region are not known. A survey was conducted over a period of three years (2004–2007) to determine if any particular fruit-growing area or fruit type is more prone to grain chinch bug infestation. Data on the type of vegetation surrounding the sites used in the survey, and climatic data of each area were analysed to determine which factors influence M. diplopterus abundance. No particular fruit type was found to be more prone to infestation. Areas with high numbers of M. diplopterus (Ceres, Porterville and Piketberg) had significantly lower average monthly relative humidities and minimum temperatures than areas with low numbers. Surrounding wheat fields and close proximity of wheat fields to orchards also contribute to higher numbers of grain chinch bug in the orchards. In the absence of methods to control grain chinch bug in orchards or on deciduous fruit, producers in areas with high numbers are more likely to experience problems with rejections of consignments presented for export. Research is required to develop methods to control M. diplopterus.",

    "abstract": "The dispersal potential of natural enemies is critical to the success of biological control by mass releases. In this paper the effects of satiation level, temperature and crowding on the dispersal of the house fly predator, Carcinops pumilio (Erichson), was studied under laboratory conditions. Adults with access to sufficient prey were reluctant to disperse and no flight dispersal was observed after 11 days of starving, which could be associated with depletion in energy reserves. Dispersion was less pronounced at 20 °C than at 30 °C. A crowding level of 50 C. pumilio adults per 200 ml container resulted in the least dispersal and did not exceed 2.5 % per day compared with up to 24 % dispersal at a crowding level of 400 per 200 ml. The absence of food, increase in temperature and overcrowding, in any interaction, could be the driving force to initiate dispersal in C. pumilio. No significant sexual differences were found in the effects of the different parameters (food, temperature and crowding) on dispersal.",

    "abstract": "The butterfly fauna of the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana is reviewed in detail. The Sanctuary covers just 1.9 km2 but only parts are truly forested. It is situated in the extreme north of the original forest zone and is currently isolated from any larger forests by some 50 km of derived savanna and farmbush. It has survived only because it provides the essential habitat for two species of monkey that are revered by the local communities. Surveys indicate that the present butterfly fauna is about 375 species, which is impressive for a tiny forest in far from pristine condition. Comparison with other forests in Ghana indicates that it would have contained about 500 species when it was part of a larger, contiguous forest system. It would thus seem that the small size and increasing isolation has so far led to a loss of no more than 125 species (25 % of its original fauna), which includes most of the endemic and rarer species in the country. A larger number of butterflies appears to survive in small forest fragments than is the case with birds. Continued monitoring would be interesting in its own right, but also because forest fragments are potentially important as stepping stones between the increasingly isolated major forests of Ghana.",

Morphologically, the external features of the body of the larva show three main regions, head, thorax and abdomen, with 10 externally visible segments. The digestive tract includes foregut, midgut and hindgut. Histologically, the midgut is lined by a single layer of cuboidal or low columnar epithelial cells associated with intercalated regenerative cells scattered. All cells rest on a thick basement membrane. Ultrastructurally, cuboidal to low columnar cells of the midgut of fourth larval instar shows absorptive cells with apically well-developed striated borders of microvilli and large rounded central nuclei, resting on a thick basement membrane. Thin intercalated regenerative cells are scattered among epithelial cells. The apical cytoplasm epithelial cells display numerous mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles and secretory vesicles.

We quantified the activity of antioxidative enzymes in the adult ladybirds that spent the pupal stage at moderate, low and high temperatures that can cause a physiological stress. Total antioxidant (TAO) and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) activities of ladybirds H. axyridis were highest in extracts from freshly emerged adults developed at low temperature (17 °C), moderate in beetles from medium temperature (26 °C) and lowest in beetles from high temperature (35 °C). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was highest at the medium temperature. After one day of adult life at the medium temperature, antioxidative activities of individuals originated from the three temperatures became similar: low for TAO and GST and high for SOD.

Local researchers were concerned that regulators may become risk averse and over-cautious, thus preventing introductions of safe biocontrol agents, as bureaucratic impediments have contributed to the decline in the number of biocontrol releases in several other countries. In South Africa, the introduction of a transparent and inclusive review process has averted these concerns. Legislation in South Africa enables departments concerned with protecting environmental and agricultural resources, to work together to regulate potential risks. An interdepartmental committee, advised by independent specialists, facilitate the review of research into the safety of potential biocontrol agents. Regulators have reviewed and timeously assessed 26 potential biocontrol agents between 2013 and 2020. This has ensured that the considerable benefits from safe biocontrol agents are available for management of some of South Africa's worst invasive alien plants. We review the system in South Africa and suggest possible improvements to the regulatory framework.",

    "abstract": "Historically, invasive alien grasses have not been considered a major threat in South Africa, and as a result, very few resources are allocated to their management. However, there is an increasing awareness of the severe environmental and socio-economic impacts of invasive grasses and the need for appropriate management options for their control. South Africa has a long history of successfully implementing weed biological control (biocontrol) to manage invasive alien plants, however much like the rest of the world, invasive grasses do not feature prominently as targets for biocontrol. The implementation and early indicators of success of the few grass biocontrol programmes globally and the finding that grasses can be suitable targets, suggests that biocontrol could start to play an important role in managing invasive alien grasses in South Africa. In this paper, we evaluated the prospects for implementing novel grass biocontrol projects over the next ten years against 48 grasses that have been determined to represent the highest risk based on their current environmental and economic impacts. The grasses were ranked in order of priority using the Biological Control Target Selection system. Five grasses were prioritised – Arundo donax L., Cortaderia jubata (Lem.) Stapf, Cortaderia selloana (Schult & Schult) Asch. & Graebn., Nassella trichotoma (Hack. ex Arech.), and Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb., based on attributes that make them suitable biocontrol targets. Arundo donax has already been the target of a biocontrol programme in South Africa. We reviewed the progress made towards the biocontrol of this species and discuss how this programme could be developed going forward. Moreover, we outline how biocontrol could be implemented to manage the remaining four high-priority targets. While biocontrol of grasses is not without its challenges (e.g. unresolved taxonomies, conflicts of interest and a lack of supporting legislation), South Africa has an opportunity to learn from existing global research and begin to invest in biocontrol of high-priority species that are in most need of control.",

I investigated the potential of using ratios of parasitoid cocoons to infestations to develop a simple and practical method of estimating parasitism levels in the field. Crop infestations by the pest and densities of its endoparasitoids' cocoons were recorded at weekly intervals over six consecutive years on unsprayed cabbage. In order to establish if there was a relationship between parasitism levels and ratios of parasitoid cocoons to infestations, samples of host larvae and pupae were collected every week during scouting for rearing in the laboratory. The majority of parasitoid cocoons belonged to the larval endoparasitoid Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which was the major mortality factor of P. xylostella. Total parasitism levels were positively related to ratios of parasitoid cocoons to infestations. Crop infestation by P. xylostella was low during periods of high parasitism (≥50 %) than during low parasitism (< 50 %), and 50 % parasitism corresponded with 20 % ratio of parasitoid cocoons to infestations. This study shows that ratios of parasitoid cocoons to infestations can be used to estimate background parasitism levels.",

    "abstract": "Cat's claw creeper, Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) Gentry (Bignoniaceae), introduced as an ornamental plant, has invaded several ecologically sensitive habitats in the higher rainfall regions of South Africa. Biological control was initiated with the release of the leaf-feeding tortoise beetle Charidotis auroguttata (Boheman) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in 1999. Although established at several field sites, population densities of the beetle have remained low with no assessment of impact to date. However, simulated herbivory studies in Australia revealed that severe and repeated defoliations could slow the weed's growth rate and its accumulation of biomass in the subterranean tubers. The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of medium (50 %) and high-intensity (100 %) defoliations by C. auroguttata, in relation to equivalent simulated damage, on the growth and biomass accumulation of M. unguis-cati. The trials were monitored for 16 weeks with repeated defoliations at two-week intervals. Despite considerable variation in the response variables, plants that were defoliated by C. auroguttata, but not those defoliated mechanically, displayed reduced growth rates. However, significant decreases in stem length and numbers of nodes were demonstrated only after high-intensity beetle defoliations. Despite reductions in tuber biomass in the beetle-defoliated treatments, the differences were not significant, while only high-intensity beetle defoliations caused a significantly lower accumulation of total plant biomass. Simulated herbivory was a poor predictor of insect damage in this study which suggested that C. auroguttata could prove damaging to M. unguis-cati, but only at high population densities. However, in field situations, synergism with a range of additional environmental stressors may increase the negative impact of feeding damage.",

    "abstract": "Nest populations or colonies of the harvester termite, Trinervitermes trinervoides (Sjöstedt) (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae), which commonly occurs in the semi-arid grasslands of southern Africa, were assessed. The entire contents of nests, mounds and subterranean sections were excavated following fumigation. Termites were extracted by flotation from volumetric sub-samples of the nest material and counted. Nest populations were found to be considerably larger than those of other members of the genus. Sterile adult populations varied from 9000 in small mounds (height = 12 cm) to 889 000 in large mounds (height = 59 cm). Workers, major and minor soldiers make up 75%, 9% and 16%, respectively, of the total adult sterile population. The proportion of soldiers decreased with increasing colony size, constituting 51% of populations of the smallest nest and only 16% of a large nest. This decrease in total soldier proportions in larger nests reflected a decrease in the proportion of minor soldiers. Ratios of workers to soldiers varied from 1:1 in the smallest colonies to 5:1 in larger nests. Undifferentiated larvae comprised 51% of the total larval composition on average and were particularly low (20–29% ) in winter when low temperatures restricted foraging and scarce resources were directed towards the development and growth of the alates. Small larvae, from which both minor and major soldier lines develop, constituted 12% on average. The proportion of large larvae from which workers are derived, varied between 26–45%. No clear pattern of changing proportions of soldier or worker larvae emerged that could be linked to seasonal fluctuations in activities such as foraging. The first nymphs appeared in the nest in March and a number of different nymphal instars were present in the nest simultaneously. By October all nymphs had reached the adult stage and were ready to fly.",

However, the diversity and abundance of these nagging pests in the country have not been documented. This underscores the importance of inventorying the fruit fly species in the country as a prelude to formulating a sustainable management strategy of these pests.Asurvey was therefore conducted to detect, collect and identify the various fruit fly species in fruited feral marula and guava using three baits, i.e. vinegar, brewers' waste and commercial fruit fly bait at Ntondozi and Gebeni. Sites were sampled weekly from January to May 2012 when the target plants grew in abundance. Overall, a total of 4168 fruit flies (23 species) were trapped. There were significant differences in the number of flies collected between sites (P = 0.0002). Fewer flies were trapped from Gebeni (1569; 22 species), compared to Ntondozi (2599; 18 species). Ceratitis rosa was the dominant species at both sites and host plants, making up 68.8 % of the overall catch, followed by C. cosyra. Of the dacines, Dacus bivittatus was the dominant species. At Gebeni, there were no significant differences in the number of flies trapped between baits (P=0.1231) while significant differences were observed at Ntondozi (P=0.0009), where the traps with commercial bait had the highest number of fruit flies followed by the brewers' waste and then the vinegar-baited traps. Traps placed on marula trees had a significantly lower number of fruit flies and diversity (1095 fruit flies, 11 species) compared to those placed in guava trees (3073 fruit flies, 22 species) (P=0.000). Host-plant surveys indicated that only C. cosyra emerged from marula fruits while co-occurrence of C. rosa, C. capitata and C. cosyra was observed in guava fruits. The results of this study could formthe basis for the development of a low-cost integrated management package for the suppression of fruit fly populations in Swaziland.",

Irrespective of the inoculation method used, the four B. fusca populations were equally suitable for parasitoid development. Chilo partellus was a partially suitable host while S. calamistis was completely unsuitable. Mated female parasitoids commenced larviposition at eight days after mating, with a peak being attained on day 15.

    "abstract": "Several vectoring insects, such as aphids and white fly, harbour secondary bacterial endosymbionts. When an insect vectors a persistently transmitted plant virus, this virus should pass through the insect gut into the haemolymph. The secondary bacteria, however, may affect the movement, persistence and replication of the viruses, thereby influencing the vectoring efficacy or specificity of the insect in respect to these plant viruses. This issue, however, has not yet been fully investigated. Hence, the aim of this primary study is to investigate the effect of secondary bacterial endosymbionts of Sitobion avenae clones in respect of the vector specificity and transmission efficiency of barley yellow dwarf virus, as well as to highlight in general the role of secondary bacteria in virus transmission. The experiments were performed according to standard protocols using one virus strain, BYDV-PAV, and four S. avenae clones harbouring different bacterial and genetic profiles. We found that all tested clones were able to transmit the tested virus strain. Therefore, it can be concluded that the secondary bacterial endosymbionts may affect transmission efficiency of S. avenae but not their vectoring specificity. That said, the clones did not significantly differ in their efficiency of virus transmission. However, this study is initial evidence of the effect of secondary bacteria endosymbionts of aphids on virus transmission and further investigation is, therefore, still required.",

In the field Agathis bishopi was found to parasitise up to 34 % of FCM larvae in fruit, reflecting reasonable biocontrol potential. Improving the rearing of A. bishopi would therefore complement the existing biocontrol strategies for FCM. In several parasitic wasps, sugar concentration and feeding duration has been shown to influence parasitism and longevity. However, their effect on parasitism and longevity of A. bishopi is unknown. In the present study a rearing protocol for A. bishopi is described, including evaluation of the effects of honey concentration on parasitoid longevity. On average, 18.2%of FCM larvae in rearing containers were parasitised under the rearing protocol described. Cotton wool, instead of paper towelling, as honey carrier for feeding parasitoids in rearing containers significantly increased parasitism and yield of offspring. Furthermore, longevity significantly increased with higher concentrations of honey. Maximum lifespan duration for male and female parasitoids was achieved when parasitoids were fed on 36 % (w/v) honey. Results from this study indicate that A. bishopi requires a sufficient concentration of sugar, coupled with frequent and prolonged feeding on a cotton wool substrate, in order to achieve maximum parasitism and longevity. Such information provides a basis for optimising mass-rearing and longevity of A. bishopi and parasitism of FCM in orchards.",

This study determined the composition and community structure of the various whitegrub morphospecies that attacked seedlings during their re-establishment on 10 previous wattle sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Whitegrub specimens collected from these trials were examined in the laboratory to determine which morphospecies were present and their abundance. Morphospecies were separated on the basis of their species-specific raster patterns. Multivariate analyses were done using PRIMER (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research) as statistical package. The proportions of morphospecies at the different sites were evaluated by using the non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Thirteen whitegrub pest morphospecies were found attacking A. mearnsii seedlings. About 98%of the total whitegrub abundance was represented by seven morphospecies and the remaining about 2%was represented by six whitegrub morphospecies. Three different whitegrub pest community structure patterns were found. The black wattle silvicultural weeding and plantation residue management practices of the South African forestry industry explained the resultant three whitegrub pest community assemblages. These practices were windrowed-burnt-weeded or with closer spacing, weeded fallow sites and windrowed-burnt-ripped or planted in an old arable land. The greatest species richness (13 morphospecies) and abundance (95 %) of whitegrubs was the community assemblage under the windrowed and burnt silvicultural practices. The whitegrub pest community was less abundant (3% and 2%) and diverse (six and five morphospecies) in sites that were left fallow before planting and where the silvicultural practices were windrowing, burning and ripping or planting in an old arable site, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Although agriculture is crucial to economic growth in South Africa, the industry faces several challenges, including the effects of pests and diseases that contribute to crop loss. Such losses severely affect the maintenance of food security. Therefore, a major challenge is finding effective, environmental-friendly control measures for insect pests. Potatoes are among the four most widely consumed vegetable crops worldwide. However, a potato crop can be infested by various pests, like the devastating leaf miner, Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) (Diptera: Agromyzidae). The leaf miner species has, since the early 2000s, become an important pest of various vegetable crops in South Africa. The species is highly invasive, causing up to 70 % damage of solanaceous crops. The damage that is caused by the leaf miner is direct, resulting from the female flies feeding on the leaf mesophyll during oviposition, and the larvae mining the leaves. Indirect damage is induced through pathogens entering through perforations that act as vectors of plant diseases. Biocontrol agents, e.g. entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), and parasitoids have shown potential against L. huidobrensis. This review investigates the biology and morphological identification of L. huidobrensis, its host range in the Western Cape, and the potential of associated biocontrol agents, like EPNs, EPF and parasitoids, as future control options.",

    "abstract": "Tephritid fruit flies, including Ceratitis ditissima, often invade citrus orchards. These flies cause economic losses to farmers and can prevent farmers from exporting their fruits to foreign markets. To detect the presence of fruit flies in citrus orchards, traps are baited with synthetic lures, which are often expensive for smallholder farmers. Farmers in developing or financially less-endowed countries have to import such synthetic baits, raising the cost of pest monitoring and control. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of palm wine and three other food-based mixtures for trapping C. ditissima and the proportion of non-target flies they trap. Transparent deli cup traps were baited with four different food-based baits, namely palm wine, sugarcane spirit-wine mixture, apple cider vinegar and yeast-sugar mixture. The traps were placed within a citrus orchard on fruit-bearing trees. The content of each trap was collected after one week and evaluated. This was repeated for eight consecutive weeks. Traps baited with palm wine captured more C. ditissima than those with the other baits. Furthermore, the proportion of non-target insects, Bactrocera dorsalis and Drosophila spp., in palm wine-baited traps was less than the other baited traps. This study indicates that palm wine, a cheap beverage across Africa, Asia and South America, could be used to monitor the presence of C. ditissima in citrus orchards. Smallholder farmers who cannot afford expensive synthetic baits could make use of palm wine to monitor fruit flies in their farms.",

The mean droplet size of prepared and most stable hybrid nanoemulsion (9.5 ppm) was found to be 60±10.00 nm with rectangular shape. The hybrid nanoemulsion exhibited LC50 and LC90 values of 7.63 and 9.22 ppm respectively against larval stages of Aedes aegypti. The findings obtained from the larvicidal assay were corroborated with SEM, histological and biochemical profiles of Aedes larvae after treating with hybrid nanoemulsion. Under simulated conditions, nanohybrid treatment demonstrated optimum larvicidal potency after 48 hrs of exposure. Further, biosaftey studies of hybrid nanoemulsion were carried out against Scapholebris kingi and this larvicidal concentration of nanohybrid was found to be non-toxic to this species.

    "abstract": "Developing repeatable protocols for the in vitro liquid mass production of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) is a difficult task and depends on the nematode species being cultured. Of critical importance is the establishment of a monoxenic population of nematodes as a stock culture for optimisation and experimental purposes. Establishing a new stock inoculum culture flask of pure infective juveniles (IJs) is challenging, particularly for the Heterorhabditis species, due to their affinity for developing into an amphimictic second generation that does not copulate in liquid culture flasks. Developing mass production protocols for multiple EPNs is advisable because different pest insects are susceptible to different species of EPN. This study attempted to mass-produce a South African isolate of Heterorhabditis zealandica and its symbiotic bacteria, Photorhabdus thracensis, using in vitro liquid culture technology methods previously developed for Steinernema species. The results indicate that the pre-culture protocols developed for Steinernema species are applicable to a H. zealandica isolate. Moreover, the results, in terms of the protein source optimisation experiments, confirm that different EPN species have different culture conditions and nutrient requirements, with H. zealandica seeming to prefer soy-based protein instead of egg yolk, having higher recovery and producing more hermaphrodites, using soy protein. This study illustrates the importance of developing dependable and infallible preculture methods, prior to the flask mass production process.",

    "abstract": "Paring and hot-water treatment of banana suckers have been recommended to prevent the spread of banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus Germar, into new banana plantations. Mortality of banana weevil eggs and larvae were recorded after immersion of infested banana suckers in four hot-water regimes: 43C for 2 hours, 43 C for 3 hours, 54 C for 20 minutes and 60 C for 15 minutes. Paring removed 90 % of banana weevil eggs, while all hot-water treatments resulted in 100 % mortality of eggs. However, only hot-water baths of 43C for 3 h resulted in high mortality (94 %) of weevil larvae. Larval mortality in other treatments ranged from 26-32 %. It is unlikely that Ugandan farmers will implement three-hour hot-water baths for banana weevil control. Also, the hot-water treatment that is most effective for nematode control (54 C for 20 min) provided limited control of banana weevil The data suggest that paring alone may be the most appropriate measure for resource-poor farmers to eliminate banana weevil from planting material.",

The density of glandular trichomes was, however, very much lower on the leaves of the indigenous species than on the leaves of a weed species, Solanum sisymbriifolium Lamarck, and two other South American Solanum species. This difference could have contributed to the depauperate faunas supported by the exotic species. The morphology and behaviour of an indigenous Solanum-feeding tortoise beetle, Conchyloctenia tigrina Oliver (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and a South American tortoise beetle, Gratiana spadicea (IQug) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), were compared. The study revealed that while the exudate produced by the glandular trichomes afforded S. sisymbriifolium a level of resistance to C. tigrina, it is probably only one of the factors limiting the recruitment of indigenous herbivores onto S. sisymbriifolium.",

After considerable deliberation and further investigation, it was concluded that the results of the cage tests had been overemphasized. The beetles were cleared for release in South Africa on the following grounds: (i) neither Leptinotarsa species attacks eggplant in their native North American habitats; (ii) in South Africa, many insect herbivores of Solanaceae feed on eggplant in cultivation but cause minor damage relative to cosmopolitan polyphagous pests; (iii) as with L. texana and L. defecta, Conchyloctenia tigrina Olivier, a South African chrysomelid that also occurs on eggplant in cultivation, fed on eggplant in indoor cages, but preferred its natural Solanum hosts in large outdoor cages; (iv) eggplant cultivation methods include crop rotation and severe pesticide regimes, which should exclude Leptinotarsa along with the other insects.",

    "abstract": "Spatial analyses of distribution patterns of selected termite taxa surveyed during the National Survey of Isoptera were used to compare various procedures for determining priority conservation areas for termites. Species richness and endemism hotspots are spatially separated. Selecting species-rich areas is shown to be inefficient while the use of complementarity-based procedures requires less land for achieving species representativeness. In addition, different complementarity-based procedures (equal species weighting, endemicity, taxonomic distinctiveness and a combination of endemism and taxonomic distinctiveness) vary in their land-use efficiency and in the extent to which they are congruent with areas containing formally protected areas as well as richness and endemism hotspots. As ecosystem engineers, termites are required for the maintenance of ecosystem functions in both conservation and production landscapes. Thus, the use of traditional protection strategies for termites appear insufficient and strategies that pursue production objectives within conservation constraints through adaptive management are required. We consequently propose a dual strategy. The first is aimed at the conservation of termite taxa in a core representative network. Second, we propose the establishment of a supplementary network of sites, comprising multiple representations of each species, for the experimental monitoring of termite persistence under different land-uses (indicator taxa).",

The six higher taxa showed several different patterns of species richness and evenness between indigenous shrubland and recently created pasture habitats. In each habitat, a trend from lower to higher species richness in both coprophagous (Oxytelinae to Aphodiidae to Scarabaeinae/Coprinae) and predatory taxa (Hydrophilidae to Histeridae to predatory Staphylinidae) was paralleled by a trend from lower to higher evenness shown by the reciprocal of the Berger-Parker dominance index. The reciprocal of this index showed a significant positive correlation to species richness. Cluster analysis of 10glO rank species abundance sequences (low variance) for the entire data set (six higher taxa x 11 habitats), which emphasized species richness, seemed to characterize similarities in diversity between species assemblages better than cluster analysis of the same data set converted to percentage abundance (higher variance) which emphasized dominance. Groups of assemblages with low species richness which mostly showed peak abundance during relatively unfavourable periods in the cool, wet, early spring (high abundance, Oxytelinae) or warm, dry summer (lower abundance, Hydrophilidae) were consistently well descriptionbed by the geometric series model. Groups of assemblages which showed higher species richness and moderate abundance and which were principally active during the more favourable mild, moist conditions of late spring, were best descriptionbed by the logseries and lognormal models. These results have been compared with others from the winter rainfall region of Europe and the summer rainfall regions of South Africa and Australia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this survey was to evaluate three field termite sampling methods to investigate whether there is a method for the evaluation of termite diversity which does not require experienced personnel. The sampling methods included the cattle dung method, toilet paper roll method and the visual searching (scouting) method. The methods were evaluated in a transect of 2 × 100 m in cattle grazing lands during the dry and wet seasons. Thirteen species from eight genera and three subfamilies were recorded with all three methods. The results for the number of species detected revealed differences between the three methods with 57%of the termite species found using the transect search method, 29%of the species were attracted to the cattle dung bait and 14%attracted to the toilet roll bait. The most abundant species, based on the number of encounters, was for individuals in the Odontotermes genus 15 (33 %), followed by Microtermes 12 (27 %). A higher Shannon diversity index (1.80) was recorded with the transect search method, followed by the cattle dung bait method (1.54), while the toilet roll bait method recorded the lowest diversity index (0.95). Results of the Chao2 and Jackknife estimators showed that all the methods underestimated the taxa present. A combination of the transect search method and the cattle dung bait method is recommended for monitoring termite diversity.",

    "abstract": "Water hyacinth is one of the five worst aquatic weeds that invades many SouthAfrican water bodies. It has been the target of at least eight biological control agents, including the water hyacinth weevil, Neochetina eichhorniae (Warner) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). However, their success has been constrained by the high levels of eutrophication in South African water bodies, which promotes the plant's rapid compensation for feeding damage and growth. The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of water nutrients on the feeding and development of N. eichhorniae larvae.Water hyacinth plants were maintained at three different nutrient concentrations high (6 mg/l N; 0.83 mg/l P), medium (2.5 mg/l N; 0.4 mg/l P) and low (0.7 mg/l N; 0.01 mg/l P). The plants in each of these treatments were then inoculated with two larvae per plant, while the controls were kept free of larvae. Plant biomass and the number of leaves per plant were measured weekly for eight weeks. The results showed an increase in larval feeding rate as nutrient levels decreased. In contrast, larger larval size, greater numbers of survivors and shorter larval developmental time were recorded as nutrient concentrations increased from low to high levels. The findings of this study will therefore be helpful to understand how larval damage by N. eichhorniae affects water hyacinth populations and to predict the success of biocontrol under different nutrient levels.",

Understanding the factors that influence maize stem borers' distribution is crucial in predicting their response to future climate change. The hypothesis of this study was that the potential distribution of the maize stem borers Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at small scale along altitudinal gradients at Mount Kilimanjaro and Taita Hills in Tanzania and Kenya, respectively, depends on other climatic and edaphic factors besides temperature. The species distribution was studied using the maximum entropy (Maxent) application with three climatic (temperature, rainfall and relative humidity) and five soil variables [soil silicon (Si), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) concentrations and water-holding capacity (WHc)]. The model accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) values based on 25%independent test data set. The results revealed that in addition to temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity, soil characteristics were affecting the geographical distribution of C. partellus and B. fusca at both the Mount Kilimanjaro and Taita Hills study sites. The relative importance of all studied variables varied between the two study sites. At Mount Kilimanjaro, WHc exhibited the greatest influence on C. partellus distribution while at Taita Hills it was relative humidity. For B. fusca distribution, the temperature was found more crucial at both Mount Kilimanjaro and Taita Hills.",

    "abstract": "Acorn burial and consumption by geotrupid dung beetles is an interesting trophic interaction recently reported for Iberian Thorectes and North American Mycotrupes species. In Iberian Thorectes species, this interaction provides not only ecophysiological and reproductive advantages to the beetles but also more effective dispersal for Quercus acorns. The genus Thorectes is particularly diverse in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, where most species of the genus occur. Due to the high diversity of Thorectes in North Africa, especially in Morocco, where Quercus forests are widely distributed, we investigated whether acorn burial and consumption by Thorectes beetles also occurred in this region. For this, field sampling was conducted in northern Morocco by searching for beetles buried and consuming acorns within 1 m2 quadrats in areas where Thorectes species and Quercus forests occur jointly. Three beetle species (T. distinctus, T. laevigatus and T. trituberculatus) were found consuming buried acorns of Q. suber in the field. Most of the beetles were found feeding on acorns, while only 20% were found in dung-provisioned burrows. These results suggest that acorns constitute the staple food of some North African Thorectes species. In addition, we found T. trituberculatus and T. distinctus burrows and nests provisioned with oak leaf litter. Burrows and nests provisioned with Quercus litter also suggest a tighter interaction of Thorectes beetles with oaks. Feeding and nesting with relatively predictable and abundant resources in oak forests, such as acorns and leaf litter, may be especially important to explain the diversification and success of flightless Thorectes species in Mediterranean ecosystems such as those of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.",

Pesticide management, although controversial due to the adverse effects of these substances on the environment and on human health, remains the main option used for controlling this pest. In the recent decades, the development of alternative approaches to synthetic pesticides is a requirement. Therefore, we used neem oil (NO) and ethanolic extracts (EE) from leaves at different concentrations to evaluate, in vitro, their insecticidal potentials against mirids. Mirid mortality increased significantly with increase in concentrations, values ranged from 32.5 to 92.5 % for EE and 52.5 to 97.5 % for NO. Apart from negative controls, Tween 80 and distilled water, that showed significant low mortality rates, both extracts revealed effectiveness comparable to the reference insecticide used in controlling mirids, except for EE by ingestion. Mirids treated by contact showed significantly high mortality rates (72.5 to 97.5 %) compared to those treated by ingestion (32.5 to 70.0 %). The greatest biological effectiveness values were obtained at a concentration of 8 % by contact exposure: 0.88 ml/ml (NO) and 0.73 g/ml (EE) for LC50 and ≈1 day to both extracts for LT50. Given effectiveness comparable to that of the insecticide, both tested extracts should be considered as effective biopesticides for IPM against mirids, especially S. singularis.",

Searching for the suitable areas to place bee colonies during winter (wintering) is very essential to reduce colony losses. In this study, several datasets (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, slope, distance from roads, and distance from plants) were analysed to identify suitable areas for wintering of bee colonies in Egypt with a focus on deserts. Indeed, deserts represent the highest percentage of the Egyptian land. The study classified Egypt into three suitability degrees: more suitable, suitable and less suitable. The south and some western areas contained the more suitable areas while some governorates had only either suitable or less suitable areas. The more suitable areas for bee wintering in deserts concentrated mainly at Matrouh and Red Sea governorates, and some areas in South Sinai and Al Wadi Al Gadid governorates. The equal contribution of datasets in the suitability map was tested and confirmed by creating a modified suitability map. It is better for beekeepers to keep their colonies in dry and warm areas during winter. The method presented in this study can be employed by other researchers to boost survival of bee colonies during winter in their countries.",

Although biological control (biocontrol) efforts were undertaken from 1984 -2003 in South Africa, the programme eventually only released two agents, the sap-sucking lace bug Gargaphia decoris Drake (Hemiptera: Tingidae) and flowerbud-feeding weevil Anthonomus santacruzi Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). To date, these agents have been relatively ineffective in controlling S. mauritianum, largely due to low establishment success due to climatic incompatibility in relation to the widespread distribution of S. mauritianum. This has prompted the revival of S. mauritianum biocontrol research in 2018, with the programme focused largely on sourcing additional agents from climatically suitable regions in the plant's native range in South America. Climate matching between cooler regions of South Africa and known S. mauritianum sites in South America identified Uruguay as a promising source of new agents. Field collections in Uruguay focused mainly on Anthonomus spp. but included stem-boring and shoot-galling weevils. Low incidence in the field and difficulties in culturing candidate species temporarily precluded research into stem-boring and shoot-galling candidates, but the rearing and assessment of the flowerbud-feeding weevil Anthonomus morticinus Clark (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is ongoing. Host-specificity testing of A. morticinus has thus far confirmed a narrow host range, suggesting it has potential as a new agent.",

Most releases were carried out with stocks imported from northeastern Argentina in 1995, but these were later augmented using stocks imported from southern Brazil in 2002 that were deemed to be better suited to the colder regions of South Africa. While the Argentinean stocks were subjected to extensive host-range testing prior to release, the Brazilian stocks were not tested prior to release. In retrospect, this was risky because of the possibility that distinct populations of the same insect species could comprise biotypes (strains) that display either major or subtle differences in host range, thus raising the possibility of non-target effects in the field. In this study, the host ranges of the two G. decoris populations were compared on an identical set of test plants, to rule out the possibility of within-species host-range variation prior to the insect's release in New Zealand. Standard host-range tests, involving seven ‘indicator’ Solanum species, failed to demonstrate any significant differences between the Argentinean and Brazilian populations in their response to the test plants in both no-choice and multi-choice arenas. Adults and nymphs from both populations performed considerably better on S. mauritianum and adults consequently displayed strong feeding and oviposition preferences for this species. There is thus no evidence of host-range variation between the two populations and we conclude that either is suitable for release against S. mauritianum.",

The study was carried out during June and July 2009 at 25 localities in 10 sectors of Larache Province. The aquatic habitats were sampled by standard dipping techniques. The habitats were characterized based on water depth, pH, temperature, conductivity, salinity, distance to the nearest house, dissolved oxygen, algae and emergent plants (presence or absence), turbidity and habitat type. A total of 54 aquatic habitats consisting of swamps, rivers and rice fields were chosen. Fifty-two per cent of all habitat samples were positive for Anopheles larvae. Of all mosquito larvae collected, 1145 were Anopheles of which 316 (28 % ) were early instars and 829 (72 % ) late instars. Morphological identification of third and fourth larval instars revealed that 76 % (n = 629) were Anopheles maculipennis s.l. and 24 % (n = 200) were An. cinereus. The only species belonging to the Anopheles maculipennis complex was An. labranchiae. Multiple factorial correspondence analyses (MFCA) showed that the density of An. labranchiae was negatively associated with turbidity, pH and depth in aquatic habitats. These findings suggest that the distribution of An. labranchiae was driven by different environmental factors. This will help in understanding the relationship between habitats, environmental factors and abundance of Anopheles larvae, which is essential for the efficient application of mosquito control methods.",

Wet weight yield increased with increased stocking density at a rate of 16.74 g/0.1 g eggs added while dry weight yields increased at a rate of 2.75 g/0.1 g eggs added. At the maximum rate tested, (6.318 eggs/g wet feed) no decrease in rate was observed and it is therefore concluded that the maximum wet and dry yields will be obtained at rates even higher than 6.318 eggs/g wet feed. Average larval weight was significantly influenced by density with the maximum observed at 3.159 eggs/g wet feed with a constant decrease up to 5.002 eggs/g wet feed and no significant differences observed at higher densities. It was thus concluded that, for the purpose of mass rearing larvae of M. domestica for biomass conversion, larval density as expressed per unit of nutrient supplied could be increased to levels of above 6.318 eggs/g wet feed but, for the production of breeding stock densities, should be maintained at levels of 5.002 eggs/g wet feed or lower.",

Feeding preference, weight lost after feeding, frass weight obtained, reproduction and development time of the bruchid pest, thickness of the outer seed coat and percentage germination were measured to determine the reaction of lentil genotypes. The results showed that none of the genotypes screened was completely free from bruchid infestation. Seeds of genotype AEL-49/20 were least infested and displayed relatively tolerant response; conversely, genotype AEL-23/40 harboured the maximum infestation and was highly susceptible. The remaining six genotypes, Matiary-S, AEL-57/50, M-85, ICARDA-8, AEL-28/40 and M-93 were categorized as intermediate (moderate resistant or moderate susceptible) to the attack of bruchids. Significant (P ≤ 0.05) variations existed among the lentil genotypes with respect to seed coat thickness (from 19 to 39 µm), playing an important role in imparting resistance. Germination test of tolerant genotype AEL-49/20 showed 91 % emergence potential. The results emphasize the importance of resistance development to maximize the protection of L. culinaris against C. analis.",

The acaricidal activity was performed by studying the mortality, fecundity, fertility and offspring development of adult females at two different temperatures. The LC50 value of C. speciosus is 2.3 %. Treatment significantly affected the fecundity of the females, percentage of hatched eggs, percentage of eggs reaching adult stages and duration of each life cycle stage. The acaricidal efficacy of this extract is temperature dependent. The greater susceptibility of T. urticae to C. speciosus was recorded at a lower temperature. Concerning the ovicidal activity of C. speciosus, extract exhibited 79.67 ± 4.01 % mortality on eggs. It also significantly delays the egg hatching of T. urticae compared to the control. Results showed that hatching started on the sixth day post-deposition in the treated group compared to the fourth day in the control group. All hatched eggs turned into nymphs in the control group while treatment reduced the number of hatched eggs and caused death of all hatched larvae before reaching nymphal stages. Extract of C. speciosus has promising acaricidal and ovicidal activities that could lead to the development of new bio-acaricides and is worth further investigation.",

A 658 bp portion of the COI gene was amplified and sequenced in 88 life stages of the species using LCO1490/HCO2198 primers. The enzymes RsaI, Sau3AI and Hsp92II were used to construct banding patterns distinguishing life stages of B. dorsalis from C. anonae. DNA barcoding confirmed the species to be B. invadens syn. n. B. dorsalis and C. anonae. Rsa I produced bands of 322 and 336 bp in B. dorsalis and 201 and 457 bp in C. anonae. Sau3AI produced bands of 103, 144 and 364 bp in B. dorsalis and 164 and 471 bp in C. anonae. Hsp92II produced fragment lengths of 137 and 521 bp in B. dorsalis and 110, 231 and 290 bp in C. anonae. The identification method was confirmed by DNA barcoding and molecular phylogenetic analysis. All the life stages within a species produced the same banding patterns with the enzymes. This molecular method will be applied at quarantine checkpoints for interception of the invasive B. dorsalis. It will also be crucial for early detection of infestation and in creating and maintaining fruit fly exclusion zones by implementation of appropriate management programmes for B. dorsalis and C. anonae infesting citrus in Nigeria.",

Genetically modified Bt cotton that expresses Cry insecticidal proteins successfully controls the bollworm complex in South Africa. Although many insecticides are registered for use against Lepidoptera on this crop, Bt sprays are not registered for control of E. biplaga. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis spray applications for the control of E. biplaga on non-Bt cotton and to compare the efficacy of sprays to that provided by Bt cotton. Bioassays were conducted in which cotton bolls of a non-Bt cotton cultivar (Delta Opal) were sprayed with different dosage rates of Dipel DF®, which contains the following insecticidal proteins: Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab. Bollgard® and Bollgard II® cotton which expresses Cry1Ac and both Cry 1Ac and Cry2Ab were used in the study. Neonate larvae were inoculated onto cotton bolls and survival observed 4, 7 and 10 days later. The Bt spray dosage rate recommended for control of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on groundnut and sunflower in South Africa was used in this study and provided between 77 and 88%control of E. biplaga after 10 days. Bt cotton provided 100%control after 10 days. This study provides baseline data on the susceptibility of E. biplaga against Bt cotton which can also be used for future monitoring of resistance evolution.",

The highest food consumption was recorded in lablab flowers (433.02 mg) while the maximum larval weight gain was in pigeon pea flowers (71.85 mg). The maximum assimilation rate (375.33 mg) was in flowers of lablab. The relative growth rate was maximum in flowers of black gram (2.27) and whereas efficiency of conversion of digested food was 36.60 % and efficiency of conversion of ingested food was highest on green gram flowers (72.96 %). An attempt on mass-culturing was made on its natural hosts and as per the studies, the culture could be maintained only up to first generation on all hosts except lablab. The results of the first-generation study revealed that, in lablab, the maximum number of Maruca larvae (38.2) successfully completed with the maximum pupation rate (71.1 %) and adult emergence (81.5 %). It was found that lablab was able to support four to six generations under laboratory conditions and the sex ratio (male:female) of 1:2 had the maximum number of eggs laid (86) on lablab. The results of significant differences among the hosts indicated that lablab was highly suitable host for rearing of M. vitrata.",

As they vary greatly in size from 1.3mm in length of L1 instar to 12 mm of fully grown L4 instar, the 2.1 mm long female Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) has to gain control of each host to insert ovipositor and lay an egg. This study tested the hypotheses that parasitism rates of L2 to L4 instars correspond with 1) ability of female wasps to subdue them, and 2) their suitability for parasitism. In a choice test involving direct observations, C. vestalis gained control of L2 and L3 instars until ovipositor removal, but it was unable to subdue L4 instar, which limited ovipositor insertions. As parasitoids increasingly avoided wrestling L4 instar in subsequent encounters, it was worth investigating if limited capability to subdue these hosts deprives C. vestalis access to a high quality resource. In both choice and no-choice tests, parasitism rates of L2 and L3 instars were similar, and they were significantly higher than of L4 instar. Although parasitoid developmental time was shorter on L4 than on both L2 and L3 instars, a significantly higher proportion of parasitoids and daughters emerged from L2 and L3 instars than those parasitised at L4 instar in both choice and no-choice tests. These results imply that L4 instar is a lower quality resource for intrinsic rate of increase of C. vestalis, and its limited capability to subdue this instar leads to higher parasitism of themoresuitable L2 and L3 instars.",

Immature developmental time and adult longevity were inversely related to seasons. The results indicated that the development of the mite increased more rapidly on bean in summer than on the other tested hosts.

In contrast, it was the shortest (11.25 and 10.39 days) in summer while reared on bean. Lifetime fecundity (62.71) and daily fecundity (5.48) was the highest on bean in summer. The sex ratio (female:male) was the highest (0.76) on cowpea and the lowest (0.66) on brinjal in winter.

Eight colonies (19.9±8.7 workers and 0–2 dealate queens) were collected in humid forests of Madagascar. A mated queen reproduced in most colonies, but ovarian dissections indicated that 1–3 workers were also inseminated, and one of these laid eggs if the original founding queen was missing or no longer fecund. Exoskeleton remains (including 29 heads) of a staphylinid beetle were found in one nest of E. sikorae, pointing to specialised predation.

Spinosad, a natural pesticide, seems to be an alternative but few studies were done to understand the induction of the resistance process. Moreover, the delayed effects of spinosad are still unknown and must be highlighted. In this study, spinosad was tested by topical application on the last instar larvae of T. absoluta and its biological impact evaluated in two successive generations (G0 and G1) using traditionnal biomarkers of toxicity and reprotoxicity. Initially, toxicity tests were used to determine the inhibition doses (ID) of pupal moult (ID50 243.50 ng). Biochemical assays reveal a detoxification process, an oxidative stress and an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in G0 and G1. In addition, our data show a decrease in vitellogenins and vitellins content in the two generations, which may affect negatively the fertility and fecundity of the adults. For all considered parameters, we prove that spinosad acts with delayed effects on G1.",

Antlion larvae in the Kalahari migrated vertically in the sand at high sand-surface temperatures. They restricted their activity to the cooler parts of the day and were more abundant in the shade than in sunny areas. These behavioural patterns were similar to those reported for antlion species living in cooler regions. It is suggested that the depth to which the antlion larvae migrated is dependent upon prevailing environmental conditions. At high sand temperatures no differences were found between the vertical migration patterns of pitbuilders and non-pitbuilders. Prey densities and richness fluctuated between the different seasons. It is suggested that overlap in microhabitat (preference for shade) and activity patterns of antlion larvae and their prey, enhance prey capture in myrmeleontid larvae.",

The use of clean planting material, from which weevils have been removed by paring and/or hot-water treatment, has been recommended as a culturalcontrol strategy. In this study, two trials were undertaken to quantify the effects of cleaned planting material on the level of weevil and nematode infestation and on plant growth and yield. Treatments included: (1) untreated suckers (controls), (2) pared corms and (3) pared and hot-water-treated corms. Initial weevil populations were lower in plots established with cleaned planting material than in controls. In Trial 1, weevil numbers in pared and pared/hot-water-treated material were lower than in control plots for up to 11 months, whilein Trial 2, plots established from pared and pared/hot-water-treated planting material had lower numbers of the pest for 27 months and 20 months, respectively. Weevil damage levels in controls were 70-200 % higher than in plots cultivated from treated planting material for the entire crop cycle. All treatments had similar levels of weevil damage in the first ratoon. Hot-water treatment afforded excellent nematode control for the duration of both trials. In both trials, treated plants had faster plant maturation rates and lower levels of plant loss due to pests. In Trial 1, 21 % of plants in the control crop were lost to weevils and nematodes compared to 2 % in treated plots. In Trial 2, plant loss to weevil and nematodes was 34 % in controls, 6 % in pared and 2 % in hot-water treatments. Eventual bunch size was similaramong treatments in both trials. However, plots with treated plants provided higher yields as a greater number of bunches was harvested during the course of the study.",

    "abstract": "The scale insect genus Calycicoccus Brain has a single described species, C. merwei Brain, which is endemic to southeastern South Africa. Females of C. merwei induce small, mostly conical galls on the foliage of their host tree, Apodytes dimidiata E. Meyer ex Arn. (Icacinaceae), which has a wider, mostly coastal distribution, than that currently known for the scale insect. Calycicoccus has been placed in the family Eriococcidae and may be related to the South American genus Aculeococcus Lepage. No other native eriococcid species have been described so far in South Africa, although the family is diverse in other Gondwanan regions. This paper summarizes the biology of C. merwei, redescribes the adult female, describes the adult male, the second-instar female and the first-instar nymphs for the first time, and reconsiders the phylogenetic relationships of the genus. The adult female is shown to have unusual abdominal segmentation, in that segment I is present both dorsally and ventrally, but a segment is absent ventrally on the middle abdomen. First-instar nymphs are sexually dimorphic; males have a larger and relatively narrower body, larger mouthparts, longer antennae and legs, and more thoracic dorsal setae compared with females. Molecular data from nuclear small-subunit ribosomal DNA (18S) and elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) show C. merwei to have no close relatives among the Eriococcidae sampled to date. Instead, the Calycicoccus lineage is part of a polytomy near the base of the Eriococcidae. Molecular dating of the node suggests that the Calycicoccus lineage diverged from other eriococcids more than 100 Mya. These data support the placement of Calycicoccus as the only genus in the subfamily Calycicoccinae Brain.",

    "abstract": "Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is primarily intended for the fresh market (Hammig & Mittelhammer 1980). Producers are encouraged to grow this salad vegetable year-round due to its increased popularity and higher prices that can be obtained during 'off-seasons'. To facilitate continuous production, some producers have reverted to the use of plastic tunnels and shadehouses to protect their crop from environmental extremes. Unfortunately, these, and shadehouses in particular, offer limited protection against pest infestations, especially smaller species such as aphids. These insects are renowned lettuce pests and 21 species have been recorded infesting the crop (Blackman & Eastop 2000). Of these, Millar (1994) has recorded five species on lettuce from sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed at determining the predominant pest aphid species occurring on shadehouse-cultivated lettuce and their associated predatory ladybird guild, the preferred biological control agents for these insects.",

Abundance of sterile adult termites (workers and soldiers) at eight sites within an area of semi-arid grassland, northwest of Bloemfontein in the Free State Province, varied between 34 and 4871/m2 (mean=2261/m2) with a live biomass of 0.2 to 27.8 g/m2 (mean=12.9 g/m2). The numbers of live mounds in an area do not necessarily reflect termite abundance. At two sites at Bultfontein fewer termites and lower biomass were present on the site with 137 mounds/ha than that with 97 mounds/ha. Experimental studies on grass consumption of artificially fed field colonies of different sizes were used to estimate consumption by termites at the different sites. Consumption at the various experimental sites varied between 2.7 and 451.2 kg/ha/year (mean: 203.4 ± 175.1 kg/ha/year) and a marked seasonal periodicity in consumption was demonstrated. The impact of T. trinervoides within well-managed grassland ecosystems where the litter-feeding species forman important link in the food chain, is chiefly beneficial and far outweigh its harmful effects which tend to be associated with degraded, overgrazed grassland and drought.",

Filter paper discs, 9 cm diameter, were used for area preference testing to determine repellency. One-half of the filter paper was treated with 0.1 ml of essential oil, while the other half was treated with a control solution. Twenty weevil adults were released into each Petri dish on the filter paper and covered with a lid. The experiment was repeated with weevil larvae. Repellency was recorded at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h of exposure. Mentha haplocalyx repellency to adults (67.50 %) and larvae (67.50 %) was higher than A. ascalonicum repellency to adults (66.25 %) and larvae (63.75 %). For toxicity testing, 0.1 ml of essential oil was applied on filter paper discs, 6-cm diameter, and papers were placed inside the lids of 100-ml jars. The lids were placed on jars after weevil adults were added. The test was repeated with weevil larvae. Fumigant toxicity was recorded at 4, 8, 12, and 16 h of exposure. Mentha haplocalyx toxicity to adults (37.34 %) was higher than A. ascalonicum toxicity to adults (26.35 %), whereas A. ascalonicum toxicity to larvae (50.29 %) was higher than M. haplocalyx toxicity to larvae (46.36 %). The chemical components of the essential oils were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bioactivity was higher for M. haplocalyx than A. ascalonicum.

    "abstract": "Saprophagous fly larvae are sustainable protein sources that can improve animal feed and contribute to human food security worldwide. The objective of this study was to understand poultry farmers' perception of the production and use of fly larvae as poultry feed in Burkina Faso. A survey was conducted among 360 households in 12 villages located in nine provinces of two regions of Western Burkina Faso. The survey showed that the majority of the poultry farmers have a good knowledge of the potential utility of maggots in poultry nutrition. Over 15.6 % of the farmers have already produced fly larvae to feed their poultry and 7 % are presently doing it at least occasionally. Other farmers occasionally collect fly larvae in decomposing wastes. However, various constraints limit the production and the use of maggots in the villages, the main ones being lack of knowledge of production techniques, difficulty of access to suitable substrates, socio-cultural constraints and ignorance of the potential of using maggots as poultry feed. The study highlights the need for raising awareness and for the development of sustainable and efficient production systems.",

This study considered species richness, abundance and diversity of predaceous arthropods of the Chrysopidae, Mantodea, Araneae and Coccinellidae throughout the day in and around maize fields in the extensively cultivated highveld grasslands of South Africa. Sweep net sampling was done at the following times: 07:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 17:00. Sampling was conducted at three different localities and repeated on three occasions over two growing seasons. At each locality there were three replicates in each of three zones in the agro-ecosystem, i.e. maize field, field margin and untransformed grassland. Shannon diversity index values did not differ significantly between the different sweep net sampling times. Predacious arthropods were, although not significantly so, more abundant within maize fields in the mornings (07:00) and in adjacent grasslands during late afternoon (15:00). This study indicated no particular time to be significantly better suited for sampling of the diversity of the four groups of predacious arthropods in maize agro-ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Natural plant extracts, especially essential oils, are used largely against plant pests. The aim of this study was to investigate the bio-insecticidal effect of chemical extracts of three plants, Mentha pulegium L. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae), Lavandula stoechas L. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae) and Ruta chalepensis L. (Sapindales: Rutaceae) collected from Tunisia, on the lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius, 1792) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), which is a primary pest of stored wheat. To reach this goal, we firstly did bio-assays to test the toxicity of these plant extracts on R. dominica adults using different concentrations of plant extracts on wheat seeds. Secondly, we analysed the chemical compounds of these plant extracts using GC-MS and GC-FID. Our results demonstrated that R. dominica mortality was significantly higher with increasing plant essential oils concentrations (CL95 values 45.68, 113.12 and 170.52 µl/l(air)) for M. pulegium, R. chalepensis and L. stoechas, respectively. The main chemical compounds identified of M. pulegium oils were: pulegone (76.9 %), isomenthone (12.0 %) and limonene (1.73 %), whereas those from L. stoechas were: camphor (23.8 %), 1,8-cineole (17.8 %) and camphene (7.69 %). Ruta chalepensis oil revealed high contents of undecanone (51.2 %), 2-nonanone (39.16 %) and 2-decanone (2.32 %). Our results also showed that M. pulegium essential oil has a significant effect against R. dominica with LC50 value of 13.51 µl/l(air) compared to R. chalepensis and L. stoechas corresponding to 39.11 and 42.9 µl/l(air), respectively.",

Recent work has focused on obtaining basic ecological information about whiteflies for the development of non-chemical techniques to control these insect pests. In this research, a series of experiments were designed to clarify the ecological characteristics of whiteflies in Hebei Province in northern China in 2012. Two whitefly species, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype Q, were investigated in the experimental greenhouses. The adults of these mixed whitefly populations displayed two activity peaks: one in the morning (09:00–11:00) and the other in the afternoon (15:00–16:00), with a tranquil period at night. The proportions of the two whiteflies at different leaf positions changed dramatically between the spring and autumn. The proportion of adults in the middle leaf position increased for both species in autumn compared to spring. The majority of T. vaporariorum moved downwards, whereas the B. tabaci moved upwards in autumn compared to their distributions in spring. The within-plant distribution of B. tabaci was more closely related to the leaf positions than leaf ages. In contrast, T. vaporariorum was more associated to leaf ages than leaf positions.",

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The resultant molecular phylogeny matched the classical morphological taxonomy reasonably well, and also resolved some ambiguities in the morphological taxonomy. Although a molecular phylogeny based on the D2 region did not change the traditional morphological character-based arrangement of anopheline taxa, some differences from the traditional arrangement were apparent in a phylogeny based on D3 fragment variation. This could, however, be due to the shorter length of the D3 fragment used in this study. Both the D2 and D3 data support the view that the subgenus Anopheles and the Neomyzomyia series are basal to the subgenus Cellia. The D2 data suggest a sister-group composed of Neocellia (Myzomyia Pyretophorus). The topology of the tree based on D2 variation supports the monophyly of all four series of the subgenus Cellia. In addition, the tree based on D3 variation suggests that the Neomyzomyia series is monophyletic, but additional species are required to support both these hypotheses. This kind of molecular approach, in combination with the existing morphological taxonomy, could help to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the anopheline mosquitoes.",

A total of 2415 specimens belonging to three phyla (Arthropoda, Mollusca and Annelida) were caught from all sites using pitfall traps, and these were sorted into 14 orders, 15 families, 21 species and 17 morphospecies. Multivariate approaches using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that some measured site variables, e.g. litter depth, grazing intensity, soil pH, soil phosphorus content and texture (percentage clay and silt) accounted for species distribution trends across sites. Site A had both common/widespread and rare/typical invertebrate taxa, and therefore was of high value for conserving invertebrate biotic communities within the reserve. The other three sites also offered optimal and unique habitat requirements for protecting and preserving species such as Ancylotrypha zuluensis, Lycosidae sp. 2, and the Opiliones. Biotope management in the reserve should therefore aim at preserving a variety of habitat patches that differ in structural and compositional vegetation. Furthermore, anthropogenic pressures resulting from frequent clearing should be regulated especially during the summer to cater for various developmental (including immature) stages of the invertebrate assemblage of the reserve.",

Following the analyses presented here, eight character areas (antennomere number, labrum form, protarsal claw shape, protibial spur, pronotum, mesosternum and mesosternal process, body shape and sexual dimorphism) are discussed with reference to differentiating Hypopholis Erichson, 1847 syn. nov. from Pegylis Erichson, 1847.

    "abstract": "This study was conducted from January to December 2010 to evaluate the anopheline diversity and transmission of malaria in Ayos, a degraded forest area in the south of Cameroon, targeted for the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Mosquito larvae were collected by the dipping method and endophilic female adult mosquitoes were captured on volunteers. Molecular techniques were used alongside morphological techniques for mosquito identification; ELISA was used for the detection of plasmodium circumsporozoite antigens. Ten mosquito species, including four Anopheles species (Anopheles gambiae s.s., An. funestus s.s., An. moucheti s.s. and An. hancocki), were identified. The mean biting rate of these Anopheles species was 12.7 bites per person per night (b/p/n). An. gambiae s.s. (6.9 b/p/n) appeared to be the most aggressive species. Malaria transmission is mainly ensured by An. gambiae s.s., An. funestus ss. and An. moucheti s.s. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite transmitted. The mean entomological inoculation rate (EIR) for these vectors was 0.7 infecting b/p/n. An. gambiae s.s. (65.6 %) is the major vector, with an annual EIR of 167.9 infectious b/p/n/year. The utilization of LLINs alongside other methods would highly contribute to effective malaria control in Ayos.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to investigate the activities of the detoxifying enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), non-specific esterases (α- and β-esterases), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and mixed-function oxidases (MFO) in spinetoram-treated Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel). For this purpose, fourth larval instars were exposed to three sub-lethal concentrations (LC10, LC20 and LC50) of spinetoram for 24 h using the leaf dipping technique. The activities of detoxifying enzymes in the survivors after 2, 4 and 6 days of treatment were compared to non-treated larvae (control). AChE activity was significantly increased after 4 and 6 days of treatment with the LC10. In contrast, this activity was significantly decreased after 2 days of treatment with the three sub-lethal concentrations applied, and after 4 and 6 days of treatment with the LC20 and LC50. While both α- and β-esterase activities were significantly enhanced after 2 days of treatment with all the previous sub-lethal concentrations, with no constant pattern after 4 and 6 days of treatment. GST activity was significantly increased on the second day of treatment with the LC10, and on the fourth day of treatment with the LC10 and LC50. Whereas the only significant decrease in GST activity was observed on the sixth day of treatment with the LC10. No significant change was recorded on the second and sixth days of treatment with the LC20 and LC50, and on the fourth day of treatment with the LC20. The activity of MFO was significantly enhanced up to the fourth day of treatment with all the concentrations investigated, whereas this activity was significantly decreased on the sixth day of treatment. Therefore, it appears that higher activities of detoxifying enzymes in A. ipsilon generally occurred in response to the intoxication by the lowest concentration of spinetoram, particularly after a relatively early time of treatment, and MFO may be considered the principal detoxifying enzymes.",

Time of development of the parasitoid was faster when females were fed with honey as compared to other food supplements. Sex ratios indicated that the parasitoid produced female-biased progenies. Dinarmus basalis produced progeny throughout their life sequentially and therefore it is synovigenic. The honey-fed female parasitoids showed the best performance with increased fecundity and longevity over the other food supplement.",

Detached fruit bioassays showed that the registered standard concentration of Delegate® 20 g/1001 and DPX-HGW86 35 ml/1001 caused females to oviposit significantly fewer eggs (P = 0.0016) than the controls.

    "abstract": "Tuta absoluta (Meyrick, 1917) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) reached West Africa in 2012 and has since become a major tomato pest. Various alternative strategies for pest control have been identified worldwide, including crop rotation, to deprive the insect of its food. However, this method can only be implemented if a good knowledge of the local host plants of the leafminer have been identified. Here, we have assessed the capacity of Tuta absoluta to develop on 27 common vegetable crops in West Africa, representing the Poaceae, Apiaceae, Convolvulaceae, Amaranthaceae, Malvaceae, Lamiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae, and Amaryllidaceae. The tomato leafminer was only able to develop and complete its life cycle on crops within the genus Solanum. Among the 27 plant species tested, Solanum lycopersicum L. (tomato) was identified as the best host, allowing for rapid development (22.2 ± 1.4 days) and a high survival rate (84%). Solanum tuberosum L. (Irish potato) (24.4 ± 0.8 days; survival rate 40%), Solanum aethiopicum L. (African eggplant) (24.3 ± 0.6 days; survival rate 52%) and Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) (25.9 ± 1.8 days; survival rate 24%) were three other possible hosts. Larval development occurred on onion (Allium cepa L.), but not pupation. A strategy that includes a prolonged absence of the genus Solanum in a production area would be associated with a considerable reduction in leafminer population size.",

    "abstract": "Phlyctinus is an endemic weevil genus of the Cape Floristic Region that comprises eight to ten species, previously classified under the monotypic P. callosus sensu lato concept. Two species of this genus, Phlyctinus callosus and P. xerophilus, are of economic concern to the deciduous fruit and grapevine industry in the Western Cape province of South Africa, causing primary damages and being of phytosanitary concern at the adult stage. The taxonomic revision conducted in 2020 raised doubts whether one of the two species was a newly emerging pest and/or what species was considered in studies before the clarification of species boundaries. Also unclear is whether these species can be controlled similarly using current control measures. The aim of this study therefore is to review the pest status of the two species over time based on museum records, field collections and historical publications, and to clarify how control measure(s) are impacted. We infer that neither species appear to be emerging pests in the region, both being of agricultural significance for at least 80 years. Phlyctinus callosus is mostly distributed along the southern coast, while P. xerophilus is distributed in inland valleys. The two species show similar biology, physiology and ecology in agro-ecosystems, and can be excluded from the host plant canopy using stem-barriers, adults being flightless. As such, it is shown that the naming of P. xerophilus as a pest is mainly a taxonomical clarification within a pre-existing species complex.",

    "abstract": "Egeria densa is a submerged aquatic weed that can grow into dense monocultures in rivers and dams in South Africa, which negatively affects ecosystem functioning and services. The biological control agent Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues-Júnior (Diptera: Ephydridae) was first released against Egeria densa Planchon (Hydrocharitaceae) in South Africa in 2018. Biotic resistance in an introduced range can have negative impacts on the ability of a biological control agent to establish and exert top-down pressure. Dipteran and lepidopteran species that are used as biological control agents are often susceptible to higher levels of parasitism in their introduced range than biological control agents from other insect orders. In addition, ecological analogues that are present in South Africa, make H. egeriae particularly vulnerable to biotic resistance. Considering this, post-release surveys were conducted to investigate if native parasitoids will extend their host range to include H. egeriae. Chaenusa seminervata van Achterberg, C. anervata van Achterberg (Braconidae: Alysiinae: Dacnusini) and Ademon lagarosiphonae van Achterberg (Braconidae: Opiinae) were reared from field-collected H. egeriae pupae, within a year of its release. These braconid parasitoids were previously recorded from a native herbivore, Hydrellia lagarosiphon Deeming (Diptera: Ephydridae). Parasitism levels of H. egeriae ranged from 50 to 74% in cold months and 0 to 60% in warmer months, with higher levels of parasitism at a site where H. lagarosiphon naturally occurs. This study also found that cumulative release events of the biological control agent increase the probability of parasitism of field populations, by directly increasing the host pool. However, biological control efficacy can potentially be increased by limiting release efforts to a maximum of two release events per site per season, with particular focus on releasing in warm (i.e. spring/summer) months. Continued post-release surveys are necessary to not only monitor H. egeriae’s impact on E. densa, but also to obtain a better understanding of seasonal parasitism levels across E. densa-invaded sites in South Africa.",

From June 2008 to January 2011, a study was conducted at three localities in two agroecological zones of Cameroon (Central Africa): Ngoa-Ekelé and Olembé (Southern Plateau) and Koutaba (Western Highlands), to assess the guild of parasitoids and their parasitism on tephritids attacking cucurbits. Data were collected on 3 249 fruits attacked of nine cucurbit species, from which were identified: 45 575 tephritids belonging to four species (Dacus bivittatus, D. ciliatus, D. punctatifrons, and D. vertebratus) and 3 330 parasitoids belonging to four families and 11 species of Hymenoptera. Most of the parasitoids collected were solitary koinobionts (mainly Braconidae - Opiinae (&gt; 50%) and Eulophidae). The parasitism rate varied significantly between the localities (p &lt; 0.001), with the lowest value obtained in Koutaba (4.98 ± 0.68%) and Ngoa-Ekelé (9.68 ± 0.54%), areas characterised by high agricultural activity and urbanisation respectively, and the highest in Olembé (23.93 ± 1.80%), a more natural area. Psyttalia perproxima and Tetrastichus dacicida were numerically abundant in all three localities, followed by Fopius spp. and Phaenocarpa sp. in Olembé. Regardless of the study localities, D. bivittatus and D. ciliatus were dominant and were parasitised by most of the parasitoids. Species richness and parasitism rates were higher on Cucurbita moschata fruits, while no parasitoid emerged from Sechium edule fruits. From a biological control perspective, the tephritid-parasitoid association was species-rich and included many potential tephritid biological control agents.",

Widdringtonia cedarbergensis has a localised distribution and is critically endangered, while W. nodiflora is widespread and common. Little is known regarding the biotic associations of these trees. The aim of this study was, consequently, to identify bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and their associated fungi on Widdringtonia species in the Western Cape. Bark beetles were collected from infested W. cedarbergensis at three different locations in the Cederberg and from W. nodiflora at one site on the Franschhoek Pass. Beetle identification was based on morphology and sequence data of the COI gene region. Fungi were isolated from beetles, their frass and the walls of their tunnels and grouped according to morphology. Morphogroups were identified by sequencing the ITS region of representative isolates. Four phylogenetically closely related bark beetle species residing in the genus Lanurgus (Micracidini) were identified, three from W. cedarbergensis stem sections, twigs and cones, respectively, and one from W. nodiflora stems. Of these, only the W. cedarbergensis twig beetle is of a previously described species and is currently known as Diplotrichus widdringtoniae. Piskurozyma sp. (Tremellomycetes) and Yamadazyma sp. (Saccharomycetes) yeasts were most closely associated with D. widdringtoniae (Lanurgus sp. 1) and Lanurgus sp. 2 beetles, whereas Geosmithia spp. (Sordariomycetes) had a strong association with Lanurgus sp. 3 and Lanurgus sp. 4.

They use hummingbirds for transport and are pollinators of some plants. Among African ornithophilous Protea shrubs, the hummingbird-pollination niche is occupied by sugarbirds and sunbirds that often carry substantial numbers of flower mites. The role of these mites in Protea pollination and seed set is unknown. We investigated the role of flower mites as pollinators of ornithophilous Protea neriifolia in South Africa using field-based exclusion experiments. Their role as pollen and nectar consumers was quantified using laboratory-based feeding studies. We demonstrate that even though they consume pollen and nectar, flower mites are not pollinators of P. neriifolia. Quantification of nectar consumption rates indicated that these mites likely have little effect on nectar availability for pollinating birds. However, flower mites may consume more than 50% of available P. neriifolia pollen when mite numbers peak. Flower mites on African ornithophilous Protea may therefore significantly decrease Protea male fitness and significantly impact Protea population dynamics.",

The plant is a major invader in the southern USA, but has minor weed status in South Africa. We investigated whether S. viarum has escaped natural enemy pressure or has recruited insect herbivores from the local Solanum flora, which are exerting some level of biotic resistance. Insect species richness and abundance and the resulting levels of herbivory were compared between plants from sympatric populations of S. viarum and the native Solanum dasyphyllum Schumacher and Thonning in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Foliage, floral material, and fruits were collected across seasons from 20 plants of each species and assessed in the laboratory. Despite no significant differences between the two species in the size of the sampled plants, S. viarum displayed significantly lower insect herbivore diversity and abundance and suffered significantly lower levels of damage to its photosynthetic and reproductive tissues. Five of the 11 specialist herbivore species recorded on S. dasyphyllum were associated with S. viarum, but in substantially lower numbers and in fewer samples. The flowerbud-galling moth Scrobipalpa sp. (Gelechiidae), which prevents fruiting in S. dasyphyllum, was absent on S. viarum and indicative of the negligible floral damage on S. viarum. Although the fruit of S. viarum were occasionally utilised by specialist herbivores, seed damage was similarly negligible. Due to its release from specialist natural enemies and with no evidence of biotic resistance, S. viarum may increase in weed status in South Africa.",

The ants did not react when subjected to air or nitrogen treatments and only occasionally responded to a stridulating nestmate. The sound produced by individual stridulating ants was analysed using a sonagram, while ablation experiments suggested that carbon dioxide receptors were positioned on the antennae. Scanning electron micrographs were used to examine the stridulatory apparatus and the putative carbon dioxide receptors on the antenna. Stridulation was usually associated with increased ant activity which included the aggressive opening of the mandibles, waving of the antennae and the positioning of the abdomen under the body when ready to sting. Streblognathus aethiopicus appeared to use stridulation to warn potential predators of their presence before they have to protect themselves by means of their powerful mandibles and potent sting. It is proposed that the purpose of sound production by S. aethiopicus is primarily defensive.",

Leaf area, number of galls per leaf, gall density and gall diameters were quantified for each cultivar. Sensation was resistant to mango gall fly attack. Only pseudogalls were found on Keitt, Kent and Irwin. The remaining cultivars showed different levels of susceptibility with Heidi the most susceptible and Kensington the least susceptible. Gall densities and diameters on Tommy Atkins, Sabre, Zill, Peach and Haden varied between localities and gall densities tended to be higher and gall diameters smaller at Lisbon than at ITSC. The general consistency of cultivar susceptibility levels between sites, and data from previous studies, confirmed that the level of susceptibility to mango gall fly is related to cultivar. A preliminary classification of the susceptibility of South African mango cultivars to attack by P. matteiana is presented.",

A polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR SSCP) assay can accurately distinguish three species within the group, namely An. funestus Giles, An. rivulorum Leeson and An. leesoni Evans. However, the SSCP gel profiles of two additional species, An. parensis Gillies and An. vaneedeni Gillies & Coetzee, although different from the above three species, overlap in their profiles, leading to misidentification. We report on the development of an additional PCR assay able to discriminate between An. vaneedeni and An. parensis on the basis of fragment size variation after amplification of the ITS2 region of rDNA. Combining these two assays it is possible to identify five of the most common species of the An. funestus group found in southern Africa.",

Although C. partellus infestations are common in graminaceous crops, this species prefers to lay eggs on certain indigenous grasses. Indigenous graminaceous hosts that are preferred for oviposition but that result in poor larval survival have been used as trap crops in habitat management systems for this pest. In this study the growth and development of C. partellus on different host plants was investigated. These hosts were maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and the grasses, P. purpureum (Napier grass) and Hyparrhenia tamba (blue thatching grass). Head capsule width, larval and pupal numbers and weight and development period for larvae and pupae were recorded. While larval survival on crops was high, no larvae pupated on indigenous grasses. Eclosion was observed from the pupae collected from maize, sorghum, sweet sorghum and pearl millet but not from the grasses. This study determined that the indigenous grasses, H. tamba and P. purpureum are poor hosts for C. partellus compared to the cultivated crops and that they therefore have characteristics that qualify them as potential trap crops for this pest.",

Efficacy was tested against Toxoptera citricida (Kirkaldy), Scirtothrips aurantii Faure and various species of mealybug (Pseudococcidae). Imidacloprid and dimethoate proved the most promising systemic treatments, but usage of dimethoate on citrus trees with fruit destined for export to the European Union has now been restricted by the recent lowering of maximum residue limits for dimethoate. The sequential application of imidacloprid (2.1 g [AI] per tree) via drip followed by a petal-fall spray of spinosad (0.0072% [AI]) plus horticultural mineral oil (0.3 %) was more effective against S. aurantii, but less efficacious against mealybugs, than dimethoate (36 g [AI] per tree) via drip followed by spinosad plus oil (dosages as above) applied at the same times.",

Ten varieties were evaluated in a randomized complete block design. Dimethoate (insecticide) kept the control, which comprised the entire ten varieties, aphid-free. Bean variety significantly affected aphid infestation in 2002/03 but not in 2004/05.

Replication included the understorey of three sites in each of four different stages of forest succession and land use (= ‘habitats’) after logging (old and young forests, savanna and gardens), surveyed over a whole year with three sampling methods. Generally, there was a good correspondence between the number of species sorted by taxonomists and the number of morphospecies sorted by parataxonomists. Despite higher taxonomic groups being present in most habitats, a large proportion of insect species was site- or habitat-specific. Anthropogenic modification of habitats did not result in a monotonic decline of abundance and diversity, as many herbivore pests and their associated predators and parasitoids invaded gardens, where plant productivity was kept artificially high year-round through watering and crop rotation. Because gardens were colonized mostly by invasive crop pests with little relation with the forest fauna, these results emphasize the concept of maintenance of ‘quality biodiversity’ and the value of considering other variables than species richness alone in conservation studies. Further, several lines of evidence indicated that savanna habitats at Gamba supported a species-poor arthropod fauna distinct from that in nearby habitats. It is therefore questionable whether in Africa insect assemblages of savanna represent a smaller subset of their neighboring forest fauna.",

    "abstract": "The gradual increase in kernel (nut) size as the macadamia seed develops, appears to play a role in the decline of kernel susceptibility to feeding by insects of the suborder Heteroptera. In some cultivars the kernel becomes resistant to feeding before others due to differences in husk and shell thickness (e.g. feeding by Nezara spp.), but species with a long proboscis (e.g. Bathycoelia spp.) could still feed on the kernel after maximum fruit size was reached. The thickness of the husk and shell, and not the hardness of the shell, was the limiting factor in kernel feeding. Bathycoelia distincta Distant (Pentatomidae) and Pseudotheraptus wayi Brown (Coreidae) were the most damaging heteropteran species with respect to the size of the kernel lesions caused. A single feeding incident during early fruit development could cause large necrotic lesions, which totally malformed the kernel. Farnya sp. and Nezara sp. caused only small shallow lesions. During the fruit maturation period, only B. distincta was able to damage the kernel significantly due to its long proboscis. The extent of fruit damage was dependent on the stage of fruit development and the species concerned. A tolerance index was developed to express the relative tolerance of macadamia cultivars to the damage caused by kernel-feeding Pentatomidae at the later stages of fruit development. Parameters for the index were the number of pentatomids attacking macadamia, their proboscis length and the combined thickness of the husk and shell of the fruit.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus species) are staple food, feed and sources of income for millions of people in developing countries and most especially for the people of the North West Region (NWR) of Cameroon. Production and storage of these grains is greatly hampered by inappropriate storage practices and pest infestation. This study determined the storage practices and insect pests associated with these grains in the NWR of Cameroon. A structured questionnaire designed to document the indigenous methods of storing maize and beans against post-harvest insect pests with particular emphasis on plants and plant-derived materials used was administered to 29 farmers selected from Babungo, Kom and Oku villages in the NWR of Cameroon. Samples of maize and beans were also collected from the stores of respondents to collect and identify the insect species. The 29 respondents used more than one method to protect their grains against damage by insects in storage. The different methods implored were conventional methods, local plants and wood ash with independent counts (percentages) of 18 (62.1 %), 18 (62.1 %) and 7 (24.1 %), respectively. Sitophilus zeamais, Tribolium casterneum, T. confusum and Brachymeria spp. were recorded in maize while only Acanthoscelides obtectus was recorded in beans. There were no significant differences in the number of insects recorded across the study sites. Therefore, post-harvest insect pests are a common problem in the NWR of Cameroon. Farmers within this region also use different methods of post-harvest storage practices to combat these pests. Integrated methods of post-harvest management should receive high priority to prevent damage and losses incurred. Management practices should focus on further developing plants used in post-harvest storage. There is equally a strong need for training farmers on aspects of post-harvest storage practices and management in the NWR of Cameroon.",

The species composition and geographical distribution of psylloids in Egypt were assessed. The abundance of Heterotrioza chenopodii (Reuter, 1876) on various host plants in different ecological zones and their monthly abundance in Wadi El-Natroun were monitored throughout three successive seasons. We used a sweep net and a mechanical aspirator to survey populations of Psylloidea species from 2014 to 2017. Twenty-six psylloid species belong to four families were recorded from six geographical zones. H. chenopodii was the most widely distributed psylloid species in Egypt. The total number of species collected per zone ranged from a minimum of two at Fayoum Basin (FB) to a maximum of 15 at Lower Nile Valley and Delta (LNVD). The highest number of psylloid species were sampled from the host plant Tamarix sp. (6 species) followed by Zygophyllum sp. (5 species). The negative binomial regression analysis showed that the abundance of H. chenopodii is more dependent on host plants (χ2 = 61.5, P < 0.001) than ecological zones (χ2 = 11.9, P = 0.018). Density of H. chenopodii in Wadi El-Natroun showed a bimodal seasonal pattern with two peaks of adult abundance: spring (April) and late autumn (December). Moreover, we recorded a drop in the psylloid densities during hot (summer) and cold (winter) seasons. Additional ecological and taxonomic studies on Psylloidea are needed to conduct integrated pest management against species with economic and pharmaceutical interests.",

The in vitro liquid culture method of mass production is used to produce EPNs of high quantity, quality and with reduced cost by upscaling. The first step in liquid mass production is the use of shake flasks to obtain monoxenic infective juvenile (IJ) inoculum for optimisation purposes, followed by upscaling to a desktop fermenter. This study was undertaken to assess the impact of the addition of agar and glucose to the culture medium, as well as assessing the impact of bacterial cell density inoculum on IJ recovery and yield. Steinernema jeffreyense was cultured in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, with the mutualistic bacterium Xenorhabdus khoisanae. In this study the impact of four different agar and glucose concentrations showed negligible impact on nematode recovery and yield. Different initial bacterial inoculum densities inoculated to the culture medium showed a low inoculum density of 2 % (6 × 106 cells) of the bacteria culture to be the optimal inoculum concentration. A bacterial growth curve for X. khoisanae in tryptic soy broth, showed 40–44 h to be the optimum time for introduction of the initial nematode inoculum into the complex medium.",

Beauveria bassiana at 40 ml suspension of 1 × 109 spores/ml caused 100% mortality of RPW. The LC50 of neem-based insecticide, (azadirachtin) to RPW by direct spraying was 1810.3 ppm, whereas that by feeding was 2117.80 ppm. The lowest concentration of neem that was 100 % repellent to RPW was 800 ppm. The repellency effect of neem was integrated with the pheromone Bio-Trap in three net houses (5 × 5 m), each planted with five offshoots of palm trees (height, 1–1.5 m). In two of the net houses, wounds were made on offshoots and sprayed weekly with 800 ppm neem, and a pheromone Bio-Trap was introduced. The third net house was the control, in which wounds were made on the offshoots without the spraying of neem and a pheromone non-Bio-Trap (without fungus) was introduced. Thirty adults were introduced, and after 30 days in the net houses with the pheromone Bio-Trap, all RPW died because of contamination by fungi. The repellency of neem prevented the insects from laying eggs in the wounded offshoots, and no larvae were found. However, in the control net house, only 60 % of the adults were trapped and killed in the pheromone non-Bio-Trap, and two of the five offshoots were infested with 26–34 larvae.",

Laboratory studies were carried out on the developmental biology of S. zeamais on four commonly cultivated mid-altitude maize varieties: KASAI, ATP, COCA-SR and ACR98TZEMSR-W. These varieties significantly influenced S. zeamais oviposition, development and emerged F1 progeny and grain weight loss. Duration of weevil development was significantly longer on COCA-SR and ATP than on the two other maize varieties. A significantly lower number of F1 progeny emerged from COCA-SR and ATP. Mean grain weight loss was lowest in COCA-SR and was correlated with duration of development. The reproductive potential of S. zeamais was significantly different on the four maize varieties, COCA-SR being the least favourable host.",

The influence of temperature on life history traits of P. burnerae was determined at 20, 22, 25 and 27 °C and compared with corresponding data for P. citri from other studies. The rate of development increased linearly with an increase in rearing temperature in the embryonic, first instar and pupal stages but reached a climax at 26.13 and 28.6 °C in the second instar of both species, respectively. Planococcus citri exhibited lower developmental thresholds except in the first instar, shorter degree-days and faster developmental rates than P. burnerae. Results of the current study indicate that the dominance of oleander mealybug over the citrus mealybug is linked neither to developmental rates nor sum of effective temperatures.",

As currently defined, the African Canthonini comprises 24 genera and about 100 described species (see Deschodt & Scholtz (2008) for a key to the African genera). However, preliminary molecular and morphology-based phylogenetic analyses of the Scarabaeinae indicate that the tribe consists of multiple paraphyletic lineages (Philips et al. 2004; Monaghan et al. 2007) and that generic inclusion should be reconsidered. Most of the 22 African genera currently placed in the Canthonini are species-poor and nine are currently monotypic. A large proportion of the African genera (14) are restricted to the isolated montane or coastal forest patches from Kenya to the Cape Peninsula of South Africa (Scholtz & Howden 1987; Deschodt & Scholtz 2008). The South African forest-associated Canthonini currently include the genera Bohepilissus Paulian, Endroedyolus Scholtz & Howden, Gyronotus Lansberge, Outenikwanus Scholtz & Howden, Peckolus Scholtz & Howden and the recently described Aliuscanthoniola Deschodt & Scholtz, Dwesasilvasedis Deschodt & Scholtz, Parvuhowdenius Deschodt & Scholtz and Nebulasilvius Deschodt & Scholtz (Scholtz & Howden 1987; Deschodt & Scholtz 2008).

We also determined its association to native arthropod diversity. Harmonia axyridis adults and larvae, as well as arthropod herbivores, predators and other ladybeetles were sampled every second month for a year with a vacuum sampler in vineyards, natural habitats, edges between natural habitats and vineyards, and urban areas. Highest adult and larval H. axyridis abundance occurred in urban areas during all sampling periods, with a peak in May and July (winter). Vineyards and natural vegetation had very low abundances of H. axyridis. Harmonia axyridis had some, but limited effect on the local arthropod community abundance. There was also a negative relationship between H. axyridis and the overall arthropod community as well as a positive relationship between H. axyridis abundance and that of other ladybeetles. Harmonia axyridis appeared to influence the assemblage composition of other ladybeetles and herbivores. Overall, the native arthropod assemblage responded primarily to season and habitat and secondary to the presence of H. axyridis. Harmonia axyridis has a strong association with the urban environment, seemingly in association with the exotic aphid Tuberculatus annulatus that feeds on cultivated oak trees. Outside of the urban area, H. axyridis numbers were very low and its ecological impacts may be negligible.",

    "abstract": "Ectomyeolis ceratoniae Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), carob moth, is a pest of several crops in South Africa. A laboratory culture was established from field-collected larvae infesting mummified pecan nuts. Biological parameters of larvae reared on an artificial diet were measured. The insect goes through five larval instars, and the head capsule sizes of the five instars were determined to be ≤0.34 mm, 0.35–0.64 mm, 0.65–0.94 mm, 0.95–1.14 mm and ≥0.15 mm for the five instars, respectively. The insect was reared individually and communally in glass vials, the latter to develop a mass-rearing technique. Developmental time from neonate to pupa was significantly slower when larvae were individually reared (38.18 ± 1.2 days) compared to when they were communally reared (24.6 ± 0.65 days).Amicrosporidian infection (Nosema sp.) was recorded in the culture, causing significantly (F1,6 = 14.99, P = 0.0082) higher mortality of communally reared larvae (76.25 % ± 11.87) than individually reared larvae (24.9 % ± 9.6).",

    "abstract": "Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) is of great economic importance to Uganda. However, its production is recently impeded by the ambrosia twig borer Xylosandrus compactus. A survey was conducted in 10 randomly selected districts in the main Robusta coffee-growing regions of mid-eastern, central and mid-western Uganda to determine (1) diversity, incidence and abundance of twig borers attacking C. canephora in Uganda and (2) ambrosia fungi associated with these twig borers. In each district, 10 randomly selected farms were inspected for twig borer species attacks. Up to 20 twigs infested by twig borers per farm were sampled and dissected to morphologically identify borer species inside the twigs and enumerate different stages of the borers per twig. Ambrosia fungi from galleries of each distinct twig borer were isolated and identified using molecular techniques. Five twig borer species, X. compactus, Xylosandrus sp., Hypothenemus sp. and two unidentified twig borers (K1 and K2), were found attacking C. canephora. Whereas the rest of these species were detected in only single coffee twigs from single farms, X. compactus occurred in nine of the 10 study districts. The proportion of X. compactus-infested farmsin each of these districts ranged from 0.1 to 1 and the number of X. compactus individuals per twig per district ranged from 2.5 ± 1.9 to 29 ± 28.1. Fusarium solani was isolated from galleries of both X. compactus and K1, whereas Glomerella cingulata was isolated from a gallery of K2.",

    "abstract": "The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Aphidae), and the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), are two major pests that conjunct in their virulence pathways against hosts by settling a gene-for-gene interaction model. The most effective controlling method of these pests is the deployment of host resistance (R) genes, which strongly depends on both host and insect genotypes. MicroRNAs (miRs) are noncoding RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides inducing sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing. The identification and analysis of miRs is nowadays a useful reverse genetics tool for studying insect virulence and host resistance pathways. in the present study, we utilized 15 virulence-regulatory miRs of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), to search for homologies across 103 A. pisum mature miRs and 86 D. citri miR-like expressed sequence tags (ESTs), mined from several databases. Our results showed that reference miRs from M. destructor could be grouped with their most similar microRNA counterparts from A. pisum and D. citri within eight phylogenetic clades, and that seven of A. pisum miRs clustered with M. destructor ones at a similarity threshold of 90 %. Such structural similarities strongly suggest that different avirulence (Avr) genes from M. destructor, A. pisum and D. citri would be tightly regulated by a regulatory network including similar miRs. Our study offers a promising way to further explore the structural similarity between miRs toward their potential use in Integrated Pest Management (IPM).",

They are generally of low molecular weight, highly volatile, have a unique mode of action and are sometimes of low toxicity to non-target organisms. One example of a volatile compound extracted from a plant is methyl salicylate which is being used to reduce aphid infestation on barley in some European countries. The use of such volatile compounds was therefore considered as an alternate control option to be included in the control programme of Diuraphis noxia (Kurd.) after plant resistance-breaking biotypes started to develop in South Africa. The aim of this study was to test the response of alate D. noxia to plant extracts from four plant species in a four-arm olfactometer. Aqueous and light mineral oil extracts of Artemisia afra (Jacq.), Datura stramonium (L.), Tagetes minuta (L.) and Tulbaghia violacea (Harv.), which grow naturally in some dryland wheat production regions of South Africa, were tested. These plants were chosen based on possible insect repelling properties known to occur in other species of the same genera. Aphids were strongly repelled by the oil extract of T. violacea and the aqueous extract of A. afra. The oil extract of A. afra, both T. minuta extracts and T. violacea aqueous extract were less repellent but still elicited an exceptional repelling response. Aphids were not repelled by D. stramonium extracts. The effectiveness of these basic extracts in repelling D. noxia should, however, be tested under field conditions before they can be recommended as a control option.",

The Dufour glands of M. meridionale and M. foreli had characteristic mixtures of hydrocarbons, but no venom gland volatile compounds. Pentadecane and hepadecane were the major compounds of the gland in M. meridionalis while nonadecane and heneicosane were the major in M. foreli.",

In 2006, Guillermet (2006) described three new species of Tortricidae from Reunion: Cryptophlebia colasi, C. destrumeli and C. gaetani, and provided the first records of seven additional microlepidoptera. The descriptions and illustrations of the new tortricids are complete (even though the illustrations of the genitalia of C. colasi and C. destrumeli are difficult to interpret because the valvae are not spread), and they provide evidence that the species should be assigned to genera other than Cryptophlebia. Guillermet (2011) subsequently recognized that C. gaetani was a synonym of Eccopsis praecedens Walsingham, 1897, which was reported from Reunion Island and illustrated by Aarvik (2005: fig. 11), and he made that correction. However, the other two species remaining in Cryptophlebia are assigned more appropriately to Thaumatotibia Zacher, 1915. The purpose of this note is to propose two new combinations, discuss the characters that support these generic reassignments, and provide an updated list of the Thaumatotibia of the Afrotropical Region.",

As the methoprene concentration was increased, adult longevity gradually decreased but female fecundity increased greatly. The highest dose (10 µg) did not produce significant effects on female fecundity, but dramatically decreased adult longevity and caused a decline in cumulative survival of F1 immature stages, especially eclosion, but had no significant effects on egg hatch and pupation. The developmental periods of F1 larvae were significantly shortened in 1 and 5 µg methoprene-treated groups. F1 pupal periods had no significant difference among all methoprene-treated groups. The results show that methoprene affects not only reproduction and longevity in the adult but also life-history traits in their F1 progeny.",

This study determined butterfly species turnover at a priori selected habitat patches inside Nduli Nature Reserve and its surrounding landscape, and their response to measured environmental variables. Using the line transect method, 516 butterfly individuals belonging to 22 species were sampled from all 16 sampling units (Sus), of which 13 species occurred in two or more Sus across the study site. Habitat patches outside the reserve were higher in butterfly species richness and abundance than inside the reserve. Papilio demodocus Esper, Borbo gemella Mabille, Precis octavia (Cramer) and Hypolimnas missipus (Linnaeus) were each restricted to one sampling unit. Hierarchical clustering using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices and correspondence analyses grouped sampling units according to butterfly species sampled. Canonical correspondence analysis results indicated that certain site (environmental) variables, e.g. percentage herb cover, grazing intensity, distance to the city centre and average flower density accounted for species distribution patterns across Sus. The implications of the study suggest that habitat patch level management for conservation action should aim at preserving sufficient herb cover and nectaring plants, especially during the summer season to cater for all developmental stages of butterfly species in the study area. Furthermore, species richness within the reserve can be encouraged by using vegetation linkages and corridors between the reserve and its surrounding landscape. Butterflies identified during the study can serve as indicator species for assessing the conservation value of habitat patches in the study area and for increasing public awareness of the need to conserve butterflies and the invertebrate fauna of the King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality between the months of November and April.",

    "abstract": "Two Asian whiteflies, Aleurotrachelus tuberculatus Singh 1933 and Aleuroclava psidii (Singh 1931), are recorded for the first time in Africa. Both species were found on Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae) in the Coast and Dar es Salaam regions of Tanzania. It is not possible to determine when these species might have been introduced, due to the absence of a routine monitoring system for pest introductions in East African countries. However, no records exist of their presence or damage caused to plants in Africa, therefore they have been likely introduced recently. In addition, Aleurodicus dispersus Russell, a widespread, polyphagous whitefly species, was also collected on guava. This species was introduced to Tanzania in 2003 from a putative Asian origin. This fact, coupled with the new introductions reported here, suggests that a pathway exists for the importation of exotic insects or noxious pest species from Asia to East Africa.",

Even though this plant is not yet problematic, nor categorized as an invasive species in the country, there are several reports that place leucaena as an extremely damaging weed elsewhere, raising warning signs regarding the potential impacts of the plant in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to make a preliminary assessment of the impact of a pre-dispersal seed feeding bruchid associated with L. leucocephala and determine its impacts on seed germination in Ethiopia. The study demonstrated that the bruchid Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae) was present at all sites surveyed and damaged up to 44 % of seeds of L. leucocephala at the study sites. Damaged seeds showed reduced germination performance resulting in seedlings with weak, yellow and fragile root systems compared to healthy seeds. This is the first report on the presence of A. macrophthalmus in Ethiopia. Therefore, future studies need to focus on the level of infestations of the plant and the impacts of the plant across the country.",

    "abstract": "The responses of Afrotropical galling insects to habitat fragmentation are poorly understood. We studied the influence of fragmentation and fragment characteristics on communities of galling insects on Neoboutonia macrocalyx trees, in six forest fragments around Kibale National Park, Uganda. Insect galls were collected from six randomly cut tips of branches from each of 10 randomly selected trees in every forest five times over a 10-month period.Atotal of 6090 individuals representing five galler species were recorded. The species richness, density and community composition of gallers were significantly different among the forests. Continuous forest areas showed similar community characteristics but some fragments were similar to continuous forests and others differed from them. None of the fragment characteristics measured (size, host-tree density, distance from continuous forest boundary and from nearest neighbour) explained differences in community measures (species richness and density) of gallers. Our results indicate that habitat fragmentation can lead to a decline in the galler species richness and to changes in the density and composition of galling insects, emphasizing the need to maintain large continuous forested areas as a long-termstrategy for their conservation. However, the similarity of community measures of gallers of some fragments and continuous forests suggest that the preservation of fragments might provide an important complement to the conservation of galling insects, highlighting the need to include also these habitats in management and conservation priorities. However, our study did not identify habitat characteristics to predict which fragments have a high value for gallers, indicating that processes that produced high-value fragments might have been stochastic. Our results caution against making generalizations on the use of easily measureable fragment characteristics (e.g. size and distance of isolation) when designing and planning conservation areas.",

However, mycosed individuals of the seven-spotted ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata, were rarely encountered. Adults of the syrphid fly Syrphus corollae (Diptera: Syrphidae) are also subject to infection with the entomopathogenic fungus Entomophthora syrphi.

Mycosed syrphid adults were always found in an elevated pssition (frequently near the tips of artichoke leaves). Two years of field monitoring revealed that both entomopathogenic fungi, B. bassiana and E. syrphi, fail to distinguish between their original hosts and the predatory insects that coexist in the same ecosystem.",

Plant alpha-diversity and cover was similar between all five plant communities surveyed. Similarly, total arthropod alpha-diversity did not differ between these plant communities. In contrast, arthropod abundance differed between the different plant communities and was negatively correlated with plant alpha-diversity and positively correlated to vegetation cover. Also, more beta-diverse plant communities did not necessarily support greater beta-diversity of arthropods. However, different plant communities generally had different arthropod communities. This highlights the importance of maintaining a mosaic of different plant communities for the effective conservation of arthropod biodiversity in this semi-arid region.",

    "abstract": "Plant cultivars that negatively influence fitness of target phytophagous insects can be an important component of integrated pest management when they substantially restrict population growth of the target pest. In this study, the effects of seven cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) cultivars on survival and development of immature stages, pupal weights, moth longevity and oviposition rates of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), were evaluated in the laboratory. Under the no choice test, overall survival of P. xylostella immature stages was highest on Karabo (67.26 %) and lowest on Megaton (44.92 %). The larval and pupal developmental period, and thus generation time took longer on Empowa (18.48 d), Karabo (14.64 d) and Beverly Hills (17.48 d), while development on Hollywood F1 (13.79 d) was the fastest. Male and female P. xylostella pupal weights were lower in larvae that fed on Megaton (4.13 and 4.65 mg), Menzania (4.53 and 4.91 mg), and Hollywood F1 (4.11 and 5.08 mg), whereas pupal weights from Karabo (6.0 and 6.82 mg) were the heaviest. Unfed female moths reared on Beverly Hills lived the longest (5.05 d), whereas those reared on Leano (3.54 d) and Megaton (3.89 d) lived for a shortest period. Under the choice-test, P. xylostella laid significantly more eggs on Empowa (48.8 %) and Hollywood F1 (45.6 %) and least on Menzania (11.8 %) and Leano (10.6 %). Although these results show differential impact of the cultivars on the fitness parameters studied, low survival rate of offspring on a crop is the primary target for using plant resistance as a pest management tactic. As survival rates of immature P. xylostella were lower on Megaton together with lower pupal weights and moth longevity, which together negatively impacts fecundity, and thus overall fitness of the pest was lower when developing on it. Megaton was more resistant to P. xylostella. The results of this study show that Megaton can play a major role in restricting population growth of this pest and generational number of eggs deposited on it.",

    "abstract": "Despite various environmentally-sensitive control techniques for the tortricid complex, many macadamia growers still prefer to use contact insecticides. For maximum efficacy, these chemicals have to be applied against eggs and neonate larval instars. Timing and spray target selection are therefore two very important factors to consider when a contact insecticide is used against this pest complex. Current results indicate higher incidence of the total number of tortricid eggs in the basal section of the tree but no statistically significant differences in the abundances of larval stages as well as number of infested nuts at the various heights were evident. More eggs were recorded in the denser inner parts of the trees than in the parts of the trees facing towards the working rows. While this phenomenon could possibly be related to the shielding of pesticides by dense lower side branches, a similar trend was also visible in sparsely-foliaged orchards where negligible shielding could have occurred. Findings from the density survey indicated that this pest complex has a propensity for denser orchards and it is postulated that tree density rather than tree height is the overriding factor affecting tortricid dispersal in South African macadamia orchards. It was speculated that higher oviposition rates in denser parts of macadamia orchards could be related to predator/parasitoid avoidance.",

Each test (20 min) involved a confrontation between a dyad of nestmates (two intranidal workers or two extranidal ones) placed in a set of two connected test tubes in which they had been isolated. Intranidal major workers showed higher propensity for resting behaviour and lower propensity for behavioural responses to elements of physical environment than extranidal ones. Similar behavioural differences between intranidal and extranidal minor workers (nurses and foragers) from the same colony were reported earlier in a companion study by our group. However, in contrast to minor nurses and foragers, intranidal and extranidal major workers of C. maculatus did not differ with respect to propensity for locomotion, self-grooming and social behaviour.

    "abstract": "Chromolaena odorata (L.) RM King and H Rob. (Asteraceae) has been subject to a biological control programme in South Africa for over three decades. A shoot-tip boring moth, Dichrorampha odorata Brown and Zachariades (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), originating from Jamaica, was released as a biological control agent in 2013 but despite the release of substantial numbers of the insect, it has not established a permanent field population. Because climate incompatibility is a major constraint for classical biological control of invasive plants, and based on the differences in climate between Jamaica and South Africa and field observations at release sites, aspects of the thermal physiology of D. odorata were investigated to elucidate reasons for its failure to establish. Developmental time decreased with increasing temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 30 °C, with incomplete development for immature stages at 18 °C and 32 °C. The developmental threshold, t, was calculated as 8.45 °C with 872.4 degree-days required to complete development (K). A maximum of 6.5 generations per year was projected for D. odorata in South Africa, with the heavily infested eastern region of the country being the most eco-climatically suitable for establishment. The lower lethal temperature (LLT50) of larvae and adults was –4.5 and 1.8 °C, respectively. The upper lethal temperature (ULT50) for larvae was 39.6 °C whilst that of adults was 41.0 °C. Larvae thus had better cold tolerance compared to adults whereas adults had better heat tolerance compared to larvae. The critical thermal (CT) limits for adults were 3.4 ± 0.07 to 43.7 ± 0.12 °C. Acclimation at 20 °C for 7 days resulted in increased cold and heat tolerance with a CTmin and CTmax of 1.9 ± 0.06 and 44.4 ± 0.07 °C respectively, compared to the relative control, acclimated at 25 °C. Acclimation at 30 °C improved neither cold (CTmin: 5.9 ± 0.08 °C) nor heat tolerance (CTmax: 42.9 ± 0.10 °C). These results suggest that thermal requirements fall within field temperatures and are thus not the main constraining factor leading to poor establishment of D. odorata in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Classical biological control aims to suppress alien invasive plant populations by introducing host-specific natural enemies from the native range. This relies on the assumption that invasive plant populations in the invaded range benefit from the release of natural enemies. Pre-release surveys in the invaded range are a useful way to determine if enemy release applies to a particular invasive alien plant, and to determine what other factors may contribute to the invasion. Similarly, pre-release surveys gather information that can be used to compare invaded sites before and after the release of biological control agents and may also identify whether natural enemies have been accidentally introduced into the country. Pre-release surveys were conducted in South Africa on the invasive Nymphaea mexicana Zuccarini (Nymphaeaceae) to gather such information about this species, for which a biological control programme is being developed. There was lower diversity and abundance of herbivores in the native range compared to South Africa, suggesting that N. mexicana does experience enemy release at most sites in South Africa. This support for the enemy release hypothesis justifies the investment in biological control for its management. However, a native weevil, Bagous longulus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), was found feeding and reproducing on N. mexicana at three sites, resulting in damage to the leaves and suggesting that a novel association has formed between these species. Bagous longulus may have potential to be distributed to sites of N. mexicana where it is not present, though further investigation is necessary to confirm if its host range is suitable for this to be a safe endeavour. With the exception of sites where B. longulus was present, leaf sizes were large and damage was low, and there is no evidence that any natural enemies have been accidentally introduced from the native range. Findings such as these emphasise the importance of conducting thorough surveys during the development of biological control programmes.",

A total of 42 species and 1380 individuals were collected from all sites. The highest diversity was found in the Shai Hills savannah with 19 species while the lowest total of only four species was collected in the Cape Three Points forest. The forest sites combined had seven unique species while the savannah locality had 12 unique taxa. Most carrion feeders belong to the genus Onthophagus; Onthophagus liberianus made up 23% of the total catch and together with the next nine most abundant species accounted for 78% of the specimens collected. Two dung beetle tribes of African savannah species not noted as carrion feeders were strongly attracted to vertebrate carrion and included a member of the Oniticellini, Latodrepanus caelatus (Gerst.) and the Onitini, Onitis cupreus Castelnau. Additionally, a forest species of Sisyphini, Neosisyphus angulicollis Felsche, that is uncommon on carrion was attracted to carrion in large numbers. For two species, Onthophagus liberianus and O. rufopygus, studied herein and previously in the Ivory Coast, the relative attractiveness of carrion and dung in each country varied greatly, demonstrating behavioral plasticity in food choice.",

    "abstract": "Insect gut microbes have a disproportionate effect on their hosts, including the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. The honey bee gut, and that of other species that have been investigated, harbours a specific gut community that is conserved across populations globally. However, this gut community changes between different castes, sexes and life stages, which is largely due to diet and gut physiology. Evidence suggests that a healthy gut community is essential for honey bees to maintain functional immunity and nutrition. Without the four important gut symbionts (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola), honey bees lack the ability to gain sufficient nutrients, protect themselves against pathogens and prevent intoxication. Unfortunately, honey bee gut symbionts are under threat due to in-hive pesticides, antibiotics and climate change. Therefore, we discourage the overuse of antibiotics and in-hive pesticides, as they could have unforeseen consequences for the honey bee gut microbiota. Instead, we recommend that beekeepers and scientists explore alternative options, such as bolstering honey bee resilience through probiotics.",

    "abstract": "In Central Africa, the development of leguminous crops is accompanied by a proliferation of pests, such as seed-beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). Integrated biological control against insect pests requires a preliminary phase of early detection and monitoring of potential invasive species, which is often limited by the availability of diagnostic morphological characteristics. DNA barcoding represents a powerful molecular tool for identifying specimens, and the mitochondrial sequences produced can provide information concerning the origins of introduced species. In this study, we characterized the diversity of insect pests present in farmer storage sites and plots of common bean and pigeon pea, by using DNA barcoding of specimens sampled in the five main agricultural regions of the Republic of Congo. The cosmopolitan seed-beetle species Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say, 1831) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was recognized as the major pest sampled on common bean. The sub-Saharan species Specularius erythraeus (Pic, 1908) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was the main species found in pigeon pea plots, sometimes co-occurring with the cosmopolitan species Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius, 1775) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). A fourth bruchine, Zabrotes subfasciatus (Boheman, 1833), and two moth species were also recognized: a species of the genus Mussidia Ragonot, 1888 (Pyralidae) and the cosmopolitan pest of stored food, Cadra cautella (Walker, 1863) (Pyralidae). These results differ from species lists compiled in the 1980s, thus providing updated knowledge concerning the pest species present in this region and fundamental information for choosing appropriate methods of control.",

Laboratory-reared anophelines are essential to advance research needed to reduce or eliminate malaria. The success of laboratory rearing as well as studies on parasite-mosquito transmission, is advanced by using an artificial membrane feeding systems. These require the optimisation of mosquito feeding to ensure that an optimal number of mosquitoes feed, thereby enabling successful reproduction or research sample sizes. In this study, various parameters such as the type of artificial membrane, density of adults in the feeding cup, age of the mosquito, duration of starvation, method of starvation, the volume of blood meal, duration of feeding, feeding in the light or dark and the effect of lactic acid were evaluated to determine their impact on the feeding rate of a main African malaria vector, Anopheles funestus. By optimising the artificial membrane feeding parameters, an increase in the feeding rate of the An. funestus mosquitoes was observed. The results obtained from these parameters increased the feeding rate of An. funestus above 50%. However, feeding rates were not significantly increased by the type of membrane, mosquito density, the volume of blood meal, duration of feeding and the addition of lactic acid to the cattle intestine membrane. Therefore, this study provides information on suitable conditions for adult mosquito feeding that allows for successful laboratory rearing and colony maintenance. Furthermore, it provides additional information for research studies that are dependent on blood-feeding, such as transmission blocking studies, endectocide studies etc.",

Four species of Ammoxenus were found, but only one, Ammoxenus pentheri, has been described, the other three being new to science. Their coexistence prompts questions concerning niche partitioning among several specialist predators. Our initial study revealed that Ammoxenus and other ground spiders were more abundant on heuweltjies than in the matrix between heuweltjies.

The host range is unusual in its composition and range for an aposematic insect that appears to sequester methylazoxymethanol (MAM) or its glycosides from cycad tissues. Studies in the field and under controlled conditions confirmed that Z. leopardina occurs on both cycads and angiosperms. Oviposition, and feeding by first to third instar larvae, occurred only on the young leaves of cycad hosts. Few first instar larvae reared on angiosperm hosts survived. Fourth to sixth instar larvae were found on both cycads and angiosperms and there were no significant differences in survival and developmental rate of fourth instar larvae reared on cycad or angiosperm hosts. It is apparent that Z. leopardina is specific to cycads in its early larval instars but that both cycads and angiosperms may be used by late instar larvae.

The wasp proved to be a suitable candidate agent because it was easy to rear, had multiple generations per year and was damaging to its host plant in the field and under laboratory conditions. Eggs are deposited in the plantlets (bulbils), leaves and/or seedling stems and the larvae complete their development in the plant. There are five larval instars and pupation occurs in excavated pupal chambers within the plant. Adults emerge from plants 5-10 days after pupation and are short-lived. Preliminary host range trials revealed that Eurytoma sp. is oligophagous with larvae being able to complete their development on only three other species in the Crassulaceae. Extensive host range trials still have to be undertaken in Australia before the wasp can be considered for release as a potential biological control agent for B. delagoense.",

    "abstract": "Sterile male Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), have been released in the Hex River Valley since 1999 in a sterile insect technique (SIT) programme to suppress this pest on export table grapes. The source of these sterile fruit flies was the Mediterranean fruit fly rearing facility in Stellenbosch, where a genetic sexing strain of C. capitata made it possible to release only male fruit flies in the SIT field operation. In December 2001 an outbreak of fruit flies in export table grapes in the Hex River Valley was reported. Growers in the Hex River Valley ascribed this infestation to the presence of unsterilized C. capitata females in deliveries of sterile C. capitata males from the rearing facility, and blamed the facility for the resulting crop losses. Fruit fly specimens collected from grapes in the infestation area were subjected to mitochondrial DNA analysis to compare the distribution of haplotypes of the infesting flies from the SIT area with that of the laboratory strain. None of the analysed flies showed the genetic fingerprints present in the genetic sexing strain in the rearing facility. This demonstrated that the origin of the infestation was not the rearing facility, but most probably arose from infestations of wild C. capitata in uncontrolled commercial, domestic and wild fruit fly host plants in the SIT area.",

Starvation and feeding treatments had no effect on the predation rate of M. muscaedomesticae. The high numbers of eggs and young larvae consumed by C. pumilio and M. muscaedomesticae indicate that these two species have considerable potential for the biological control through augmentative releases against house flies breeding in poultry manure.",

The development of appropriate sampling plans is needed for cost-effective control of stored-product insect pests. Sequential sampling plans for classifying pest status help the manager to decide whether or not to implement control measures, with a minimum risk of error using few sampling units. From September 1998 to February 2001, a sampling plan, using sex pheromone traps, was implemented in the cigarette factory in Cape Verde, to assist management decision-making based on an empirical threshold of 10 insects/week/trap and to make inferences about the pest population, such as its density and spatial pattern. From the results obtained a sequential sampling plan was developed for classifying the pest status of L. serricorne based on complete counts from insects caught in the pheromone traps. Two sequential sampling techniques were used: the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), as the adult population followed the binomial negative distribution, and Iwao's confidence interval method. It was shown that, using SPRT or Iwao's methods, managers can make decisions using six and 13 traps, respectively, with a minimum risk of incorrect assessment.",

Sampling error was affected by whether the colonies were found in wounds or in leaf axils. Parasitism of colonies in leaf axils had a slight effect on sampling error. Sampling error for colonies in leaf axils was high at just over 40 %. However, decisions regarding intervention were not markedly compromised by simply classifying the 25 trees as infested or uninfested, as opposed to counting colonies in leaf axils. The presence-absence system greatly reduced the time spent monitoring E. lanigerum population levels, making it an attractive system for assessing woolly apple aphid infestations in commercial orchards.",

As the Kalahari forms a wide disjunction between the species' ranges, G. humanus (Karoo–Namib) and G. humeralis (dry savanna) may be differentiated by geographical location alone. The past practise of providing names for colour varieties is not considered useful as G. humanus shows the full range in exoskeleton colour variation, from entirely blue to entirely green to entirely cupreous, in the same local populations of the central Northern Cape, South Africa. Type specimens of G. humanus and its synonyms originated either from the southern range extremes (southern Karoo, South Africa) where the populations predominantly comprise blue individuals or from the northern extremes (southwest Angola) where the populations entirely comprise cupreous individuals.",

    "abstract": "In some scarp forests in KwaZulu-Natal, perching behaviour by two species of the genus Onthophagus Latreille, 1802 (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) was observed repeatedly. Perching behaviour is commonly observed among many dung beetle species of the subfamily Scarabaeinae. Various causes of the behaviour have been suggested, e.g. thermoregulation (Young 1984), predator avoidance (Young 1982), and rest perching at night for diurnal species (Cambefort & Walter 1991), but the most widely applicable explanation seems to be a foraging strategy for finding an ‘odour path’ to fresh dung (Howden & Nealis 1978; Howden et al. 1991). Perching usually occurs at low heights above ground, and perching species are mostly small (less than 1 cm) and have the ability to fly away very rapidly (Howden & Nealis 1978; Cambefort & Walter 1991). At least in some New World areas perching height seems to have a direct relation to beetle size (Howden & Nealis 1978; Howden et al. 1991). Most reports of perching come from tropical forests (see Davis 1999 for a recent review), mainly in lowlands, with very few records from subtropical (e.g. Williams 1993 for Australia) and temperate forests (Young 1982 for U.S.A.). In the Afrotropical Region there are records only from the GuineoCongolian tropical rainforest block (Cambefort & Walter 1991). The data provided in this note are therefore remarkable both because this is the first time that this behaviour is reported for South Africa and because the scarp forests of KwaZuluNatal have intermediate characters between the subtropical Indian Ocean coastal belt forests and the Afromontane/Afrotemperate forests of KwaZulu-Natal’s interior (Maltitz et al. 2003; Mucina & Rutherford 2006). All observations were made during the rainy season, in the late morning between 10:00 and 12:00, under cloudy weather conditions. Both observed Onthophagus species are relatively small (8–10 mm) and darkly coloured, O. lugens being black, and O. declivicollis being dark brown. Voucher specimens are housed in the Department of Zoology and Entomology, University of Pretoria, and in the author’s collection.",

The genotoxic investigations occurred on the whole body cells of adults that emerged from the fully grown larvae in sand treated with lethal concentrations (LC50 = 0.96, 11.4ppm of pyriproxyfen and novaluron, respectively) and those emerged from the 1-day-old pupae in sand treated with lethal concentrations (LC50 = 4.5, 6200 ppm of pyriproxyfen and novaluron, respectively). Comet assay is the technique used in this study. The comet assay (SCGE - single-cell gel electrophoresis) is often used in measurements of the level of DNA strand breaks in individual eukaryotic cells as a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive method. However, the IGR is considered to have little human toxicity because humans do not make chitin and do not make or use the hormones that insects use in moulting, but it was noticed that IGR-treated insects resulted a significant increase in DNA damage values expressed as tail length (TL), tail moment (TM) and DNA tail%in the body cells compared to the control insects. These results mean that workers should be careful when using IGRs in the field due to the conservation of genes and pathways affecting key biological processes between flies and humans.",

Bt cotton expressing Cry1Ac is mainly toxic to the bollworm complex (Helicoverpa armigera, Pectinophora gossypiella, Earias insulana and E. vittella). The rapid adoption of Bt cotton technology in India imposes a strong selection pressure on the target pest with a risk of resistance development to Cry toxins including Cry2Ab following the introduction of dual gene BG-II cotton in 2006. Spotted bollworm, Earias insulana infests the cotton crop during the early season as a shoot borer and damages fruiting bodies during mid-season crop growth. Efficacy of Bt cotton hybrids BG-II (Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab) and Bt (Cry1Ac) through leaf (90–95-day-old crop) and square (80–85-day-old crop) bioassay under laboratory conditions, recorded 97–100 % mortality on leaves of BG-II, 93 % on Bt and 1.3–5.4 % on non Bt against 1-day-old larvae of Earias insulana.

    "abstract": "There has been a recent increase in new records of insects from the subtropical parts of South Africa that have expanded their historical ranges to now include the biologically and climatically atypical southwestern Cape region at the tip of the African continent. Suggested mechanisms include climate change, provision of previously absent nutriments and direct transport of individuals via human activities. Here we summarise previous reports of fruit chafer beetles (Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae: Cetoniini) invading the southwestern Cape region, provide additional data on their distributions and provide data for additional taxa that have now also been newly recorded in the region. The newly reported species Pachnoda sinuata sinuata probably naturally occurs in the region but has gone unnoticed due to specialised habitat requirements and morphological similarity to a widespread generalist. Some taxa are very recent arrivals while others have been known from the region for a long time, but all are experiencing noticeable population increases in urban and agricultural areas. We propose that these species likely dispersed from their native ranges to the southwestern Cape via direct transport of colonised nursery stock and their recent increases in population size are consistent with what is expected when founder populations overcome barriers to reproduction. All of the new arrivals are well-adapted to transformed landscapes in the subtropics and do not occupy natural vegetation in the newly invaded ranges, strengthening the hypothesis that pre-adaptation to human settlements aid biological invasions of otherwise unsuitable bioregions in South Africa. As many additional species are pre-adapted to transformed biotopes in subtropical areas, one would expect that additional species will colonise the southwestern Cape in the future with unknown economic, ecological and evolutionary consequences.",

The size of the termite population of the antecedent dry season also had an important influence. Populations were found to build up over successive dry years and crashed following a season of substantially above average rainfall to fall further after the next rainy season which was also above average. Termite populations and foraging activity also fluctuated considerably within seasons. There was an increase as the dry season progressed but foraging fell dramatically at the end of the season and remained at low levels throughout the summer months. Foraging was confined to degraded patches in the red-soil veld mosaic in the early dry season with expansion into the other grass communities occurring in the late dry season. Fluctuations in harvester termite populations had a marked effect on the extent of the foraging area and hence on the amounts of grass cover remaining in the degraded, ecotone and sound veld communities of the red-soil mosaic at the end of the dry season. Termite foraging activities serve to maintain the grass sward in a vigorous condition by preventing excessive accumulation of dead foliage on ungrazed sites and they had an important influence on the botanical changes which occurred within each grass community of the mosaic. The main effect was to favour those grass species such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, that are intolerant of excessive top-hamper (standing dead grass) and litter accumulation.",

The aim of this research was to investigate its seasonal activity patterns and damage potential on citrus crops, in comparison to a pest of phytosanitary concern and one it can be confused with in the larval stage, the false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick). The study was carried out over 20 months in two regions, one with predominantly citrus and one with mixed agricultural production. Carob moth activity patterns indicated two periods of activity (summer and early spring), with damage taking place in citrus during autumn, close to harvest. The results showed that there were no significant differences in carob moth trap catches between the two study sites (F1,4 = 0.00661, P = 0.94) and no significant differences in wild false codling moth catches between the two study sites (F1,4 = 1.2960, P = 0.32). While traps in both regions caught carob moths in equal abundances, damage only occurred in the region dominated by citrus crops. Assessing pest status, relative to the false codling moth, indicated that carob moth is not currently a major economic pest.",

The DPM infestation, in the first week, started with a high female proportion (from 0.78 to 1) in both regions of the ‘kimri' fruit stage, and remained female-biased till the fifth week of infestation (from 1.5:1 to 4:1) with a growing DPM population density in both regions. The DPM sex ratio declined to equality (1:1) during the sixth week of infestation, the onset of the ‘khilal’ fruit stage, and further declined to a male-biased sex ratio (4:1) on the Selj, Hamra and Shaishie cultivars, with a declining DPM population density in the last week of infestation. The date fruit stage affected the sex ratio of DPMs negatively in Riyadh and positively in Qateef. The interaction between the week and fruit stage had a significant positive effect on the DPM sex ratio in Riyadh, and a negative effect in Qateef. This study of the DPM sex ratio could be a step in establishing a female-based sampling programme during the early weeks of infestation.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity, and the repellency/attractancy effects of five essential oils (clove, castor, cinnamon, black cumin and anise) on E. orientalis under laboratory conditions. Also, field experiments were performed to investigate the efficacy of two essential oils (castor oil and black cumin 10 %), compared with other acaricides and predacious mites. Two acaricides (abamectin 5 % EC [Biomectin™] and fenpyroximate 5 % SC [Ortus ]), in addition to the predacious mites Phytoseiulus persimilis and Euseius scutalis, applied at two levels of release (200 and 300 individuals/tree). The results showed that after 1 h of the treatment, essential oils of black cumin and anise recorded the highest percentage of repellency (80–100 %) followed by castor oil (30–90 %), and clove oil (50 and 70 %), while cinnamon was the lowest. In addition, castor oil showed good repellency effect after 6 h, while black cumin has the same effect after 1 h of application. Field experiments revealed that castor oil gave the best efficacy in suppressing E. orientalis population compared with control, followed by black cumin oil. While applying the acaricides fenpyroximate and abamectin recorded good reduction of E. orientalis with mortality of 88.85 and 87.92 %, respectively. The numbers of E. orientalis were affected by releasing the biological control agent P. persimilis at 200 and 300 individuals/tree, where the numbers of E. orientalis decreased on trees to 1.5, 1.0 indiv./10 leaves after 15 days of release compared with pre-treatment account 3.0, 2.5 indiv./10 leaves, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The five-spotted fruit fly, Ceratitis quinaria (Bezzi) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is distributed in parts of eastern and western Africa, northern Africa and southern Africa (including South Africa). The species also occurs outside of Africa, in Yemen. The host range of C. quinaria is narrow, with Mangifera indica L. being the main host of commercial importance. Ceratitis quinaria was claimed to be associated with citrus in Sudan although this claim was never substantiated and there has never been any confirmed reared record of C. quinaria on citrus despite numerous surveys of citrus across Africa. In order to verify the type of association that C. quinaria has with citrus, field surveys were carried out in South Africa to determine the distribution and seasonal occurrence of C. quinaria in commercial citrus orchards and the possible natural infestation of citrus by this species. Surveys on distribution of C. quinaria across South Africa were carried out in 1999 and 2000 by trapping with Ceratitislure (containing protein hydrolysate and β-caryophyllene). The seasonal occurrence of C. quinaria in the northern areas of South Africa was determined over two years between 2015 and 2017 by trapping with Enriched Ginger Oil (EGO), a male lure containing α-copaene. In the same trapping period, citrus and other fruit were sampled to determine infestation by C. quinaria. Additionally between 2009 and 2018, citrus fruit was sampled from the trees and ground in other commercial and non-commercial areas in the north of South Africa. All fruit samples collected were incubated for at least five weeks to allow rearing of flies to the pupal and adult stages. Trapping surveys conducted between 1999 and 2000 showed the presence of C. quinaria only in the northern areas of South Africa. Catches of C. quinaria males in EGO-baited traps were low in commercial citrus orchards (peak of catches being lower than 0.05 flies/trap/day). Catches of C. quinaria were mainly recorded outside of the citrus ripening period. No C. quinaria was reared from any of the citrus fruit sampled, even in those areas where the presence of the species was demonstrated by catches in EGO-baited traps. The fruit surveys therefore demonstrated the absence of natural infestation of citrus with C. quinaria in South Africa and supported existing biological information that citrus is not a host for C. quinaria.",

GA3 treatment was more effective on mandarin than navel orange in terms of rate of false punctures and egg-laying density, whereas it showed more effect on the true puncture numbers of navel oranges than mandarins. The results also showed that fruit infestation parameters were inversely proportional to fruit peel hardness. Fruit peel hardness was GA3 dose-dependent, with significant differences between host types, as well as among GA3 concentrations, with higher values on navel orange than mandarin. Results also revealed that date (progress of fruit age) had a weak effect on both infestation parameters by PFF, and fruit peel hardness.

Using trunk barriers to prevent the flightless weevils from reaching the leaves and fruits is labour-intensive. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are effective biocontrol agents for the control of soil-borne and above-ground insect pests. Different EPF isolates were screened at 1 × 106 conidia/ml for virulence against different life stages (larvae, pupae and adults) of the BFW. The results indicated that unformulated, laboratory-cultured Beauveria bassiana 1 (Broadband®) and Metarhizium anisopliae 1 (Meta 69®) resulted in significantly higher BFW larval mortality of 97 % and 93 %, respectively, than B. bassiana 2 (Eco-Bb®) with 58 % mortality. Beauveria bassiana 1 (92 %) resulted in significantly higher pupal mortality than B. bassiana 2 (68 %) and M. anisopliae 1 (66 %). Beauveria bassiana 1 caused 90 % adult BFW mortality, which differed significantly from that obtained with B. bassiana 2 (69 %) and M. anisopliae 1 (65 %). A local EPF isolate (EA2) was compared with the commercial EPF isolates, and B. bassiana 1 (92 %) again caused significantly higher mortality of BFW adults compared to B. bassiana 2 (65 %), M. anisopliae 1 (60 %) and M. anisopliae isolate EA2 (64 %). In a sand bioassay using final instar BFW larvae, B. bassiana 1 (85 %) resulted in higher mortality than both B. bassiana 2 (55 %) and M. anisopliae 1 (70 %). The results indicated that all the commercial EPF isolates were effective against the immature and adult stages of the BFW, but with clear differences between isolates. Beauveria bassiana 1 consistently caused the highest BFW mortality under laboratory conditions. Large-scale field trials with the formulated commercial products are recommended to further demonstrate the potential use of this biocontrol agent in integrated pest management programmes.",

Scarring damage by thrips results in corky tissue development, making the fruit unsuitable for export and potentially costing the country in lost export revenue. Thrips management is complicated by the multiple and protracted flowering patterns of susceptible cultivars. In addition, widespread pesticide resistance of thrips and the negative environmental effects along with minimum residue levels for export fruit limit the application of pesticides for thrips control. Monitoring an insect pest's presence and abundance is the first step in thrips management. This study aimed to investigate S. aurantii's colour preferences, establish the distribution of thrips in the orchard and population dynamics from flowering to fruit establishment. Attractiveness followed the order yellow > blue, white, clear > red, black, purple and orange. Thrips were evenly distributed throughout the orchard, with the highest populations occurring during flowering (August), declining sharply and picking up in the summer months starting December. Yellow sticky cards are recommended as a monitoring tool.",

Incipient colonies were reared in the laboratory with colony foundation and development and caste differentiation being observed over three months. Early colony mortality was high, with only a 4 % survival rate over three months. Oviposition began 4–12 days after pairing, with all females collected after a specific swarming flight starting to lay on the same day. The oviposition rate was initially high, with a mean of 17.85 (S.E. ± 1.314) eggs per individual being laid in the initial clutch; thereafter, the rate decreased to a mean of 1.7 (S.E. ± 0.078) eggs per day. Following hatching, the rate of oviposition decreased further to 0.9 eggs per day (S.E. ± 0.3049). Incubation of eggs varied between 20 and 34 days. As with oviposition, hatching started on the same day in all colonies set up after a specific swarming flight; however, not all the eggs laid on that specific date hatched simultaneously. Second (L2) and third (L3) instar larvae first appeared in the colonies a mean of 6.6 (S.E. ± 0.578) days and 11.5 (S.E. ± 0.3193) days, respectively, after the first eggs hatched. The first pre-soldier (SPS), which developed from a third instar larva, was differentiated a mean of 21.85 (S.E. ± 0.748) days after hatching, with the first soldier (SS) appearing 30.75 (S.E. ± 0.4787) days following hatching. The first major (LW) and minor (SW) workers were differentiated respectively 26 ± 0.660 and 28 ± 0.905 days after hatching. Approximately three months after alates had left the parent nest, workers began foraging. At three months, the single surviving colony contained 60 individuals. No large soldier (LS) had differentiation by 20 months.",

This wastewater is used to irrigate different crops and trees. This study was planned to observe the entry of Cd from inorganic to organic source and its effects on the lifecycle of Bombyx mori (L.). Mulberry plants were irrigated with Cd-containing synthetic effluents of different concentrations (25 to 200 mg/l) at pH 5, and different levels of pH (3 to 5) at 100 mg/l, to check against different instars of silkworm. The amount of Cd in the samples of soil, mulberry leaves, silkworm larvae, silkworm faeces and silk glands were determined by using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The results showed that B. mori can be used as an indicator of Cd pollutants because its body weight, body length and mortality rate was directly related to Cd concentration. Greater toxicity to silkworms was observed at higher accumulation of Cd in mulberry leaves. Maximum accumulation of Cd in soil, mulberry plants, silkworm larvae, silk glands and silkworm faeces was observed at 200 mg/l Cd and pH 5. The maximum accumulations observed were 99.89 mg/kg, 95.67 mg/kg, 61.32 mg/kg, 58.97 mg/kg and 6.59 mg/kg, respectively.

The aim of this study was to survey the phytophagous insects associated with L. ferocissimum in South Africa and prioritise promising biological control agents. In South Africa, the plant occurs in two geographically distinct areas, the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. Surveys for phytophagous insects on L. ferocissimum were carried out repeatedly over a two-year period in these two regions. The number of insect species found in the Eastern Cape Province (55) was higher than that in the Western Cape Province (41), but insect diversity based on Shannon indices was highest in the Western Cape Province. Indicator species analysis revealed eight insect herbivore species driving the differences in the herbivore communities between the two provinces. Based on insect distribution, abundance, feeding preference and available literature, three species were prioritised as potential biological control agents. These include the leaf-chewing beetles Cassida distinguenda Spaeth (Chrysomelidae) and Cleta eckloni Mulsant (Coccinellidae) and the leaf-mining weevil Neoplatygaster serietuberculata Gyllenhal (Curculionidae).",

Olive-associated Braconidae are known to parasitise the larvae of Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), and probably also Bactrocera biguttula (Bezzi). The lifestyle of olive-associated Chalcidoidea is not fully understood, and may include phytophagous, parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species. Some chalcids could represent olive seed wasps (OSW), a generic term that designates the seed feeders responsible for losses in commercial olive production. In order to obtain direct DNA-based evidence for the lifestyle of four putative OSW – Eupelmus spermophilus Silvestri, Eurytoma oleae Silvestri, Eurytoma varicolor Silvestri, Sycophila aethiopica (Silvestri); and the parasitoid Neochrysocharis formosus (Westwood) – we developed a multiplex PCR assay comprising species-specific primers for each species. The assay was used to survey larvae collected from the seeds of wild and cultivated olives. Eupelmus spermophilus was the most abundant species in wild and cultivated olives, and may represent a threat to the local olive industry. Eurytoma oleae was found only within the seeds of wild olives, and may also represent an OSW. We found direct evidence supporting the potential agricultural relevance of S. aethiopica and E. varicolor as parasitoids of E. spermophilus. These results may inform strategies for the management and control of OSW in the Western Cape.",

    "abstract": "Most ponerine ants have colonies with up to a few hundreds of workers, but there has been sporadic evolution of species with more populous colonies. Forty two nests of Paltothyreus tarsatus were excavated from three distinct habitats in the Ivory Coast. Colonies were monogynous in Comoé (forest and savanna), but polygynous in Taï (rainforest). Mean colony size was 1576 ± 1543 workers, with the biggest colonies (exceeding 5000 adults) restricted to forest. Hundreds of sexuals occurred in many nests. Unlike males, young queens stay in the nests at least six months before the mating flight, presumably to accumulate fat reserves. This together with high absolute numbers of gynes and their large size relative to workers, amounts to a striking reproductive investment. We discuss this investment in the context of non-claustral independent colony foundation. Mating was observed in large male aggregations, unlike in South Africa where queens mate near the natal nests.",

They generally feed below-ground on dead plant material or on standing, dead herbaceous or woody plants and vegetation litter (Jouquet et al. 2005; Berge et al. 2008). Termite mounds can reduce plant stands, with plant colonization hampered by hardness of mound soil or by active termite foraging (Malaka 1977; Pomeroy 1983). Yet sometimes, plant growth can increase on and around intact termitaria (Flemming & Loveridge 2003; Jouquet et al. 2005), while rainfall runoff at the base of the termitarium enables grasses to survive drought (Steinke & Nel 1989). Termitaria can also serve as seed reserves (Steinke & Nel 1989), as some termite species relocate sparsely-distributed food resources into the mound, which in turn, acts as a concentrated central seed store (Dangerfield 1990), and alters rate of seed growth and senescence (Curry 1987).",

    "abstract": "Applications of Madex® (granulovirus) against the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, which targets neonate larvae before or during their initial entry into fruit, provide selective control of this key apple pest. Differences in the efficacy of Madex® treatment against C. pomonella larvae were observed in an experimental orchard in northern Italy on two apple tree cultivars, ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Red Chief’. The intensity of egg-laying by the moth may vary from one cultivar to another. The composition of a metabolite blend on the leaf surface consisting of glucose, fructose, sucrose, sorbitol, quebrachitol and myo-inositol is one of the factors that could explain these variations. Our hypothesis was therefore that variations in the efficacy of Madex® could be related to variations in egg numbers, itself related to the composition of metabolites on the leaf surface of each cultivar. Differences in egg-laying (number and localization) were recorded on the two cultivars, ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Red Chief’, untreated or treated with the larvicide. Madex® had the same efficacy on both cultivars in terms of the reduction of fruit damage due to larval feeding. Surprisingly, the effect of Madex® on reducing damage seemed less tied to a lethal effect of the larvicide on the larvae than to egg-laying reduction, the latter being linked to changes in chemical signals of the leaf surface induced by applications of Madex®. This observation was verified by experiments on egg-laying on an artificial substrate. When the active metabolite blends mimicking the corymb leaf surface compositions of each cultivar (untreated and treated with Madex®) were applied to nylon cloth egg-laying substrates, significant reductions in acceptance (% of egg-laying females) and egg-laying stimulation (number of eggs per egg-laying female) were observed. The reduction of eggs on ‘Red Chief’ could be primarily explained by a drastic effect on egg-laying stimulation, whereas the reduction on ‘Golden Delicious’ was partly due to a lower acceptance. The number of eggs laid naturally differs from one apple tree cultivar to another. The effects of reduced egg-laying caused by applications of Madex® were due to biochemical changes in surface blends, depending on the cultivar.",

One of the principal insect pests associated with A. linearis production is the root-boring clearwing moth, Monopetalotaxis candescens Felder & Felder (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae). Annual moth flights peak during November/December, resulting in young plantations being targeted during the hot, dry summer conditions prevailing at this time. Average infestation levels progressively increased from 28 ± 2 % in year 1, to 53 ± 2 % and 72 ± 1 % in years 2 and 3, respectively. A second, 4–6 years old plantation during the three-year survey period was found to be severely infested (average 92 ± 1 %) with virtually no additional infestation over time. Estimated losses to borer infestation were calculated at 4, 24, 27 and 36 % in plantations that were 1–4 years old, respectively. Significantly more eggs were laid on leaves (66 ± 4 %) compared to woody tissue, stems and twigs. Most eggs hatched between 02:00 and 04:00, with neonates migrating down to the stem base and entering the root just below the soil surface. A control strategy, exploiting aspects of neonate migratory and feeding behaviour, should result in both yield increases and prolonged survival of plantations beyond the typical 4–5-year cycle.",

The field biology of P. burnerae on citrus in the Western Cape Province of South Africa was studied through periodic sampling of leaves from twigs enclosed in sleeve cages. The species composition and abundance of natural enemies was investigated. Both adult and immature stages attained maximum population peaks in March and P. burnerae had four generations. The highest level of mortality was experienced in the immature stages. Climate and an unidentified fungus were the key mortality factors. The level of abundance of the two observed predators, the harlequin beetle, Harmonia axyridis, and the green lacewing, Chrysoperla sp., was relatively low. Although parasitism occurred in some cages, the level was low, ranging between 1.62 and 9.43 %. If biocontrol is the preferred method of controlling P. burnerae, suitable candidate parasitoids for inoculative biocontrol are Acerophagus sp., Leptomastix sp. and Microterys nietneri. The oleander mealybug does not share the same parasitoids with Planococcus citri, Pseudococcus calceolariae and Pseudococcus longispinus except for the parasitoid Coccophagus sp. The most popular species of parasitoids used in the biolological control of mealybugs, Anagyrus sp. and Coccidoxenoides sp., were insignificant in the case of P. burnerae.",

The effect of seven constant temperatures, namely 15, 19, 26, 28, 31, 36 and 38 °C on its reproduction, development and survival was determined. Longevity decreased as rearing temperatures increased. The optimum temperature for oviposition was between 26 and 28 °C with a mean of 246 and 276 eggs/female at 26 and 28 °C, respectively. There was also a significantly greater longevity compared to the other temperatures evaluated. No eggs were laid at or below 15 °C. Nysius natalensis could not complete its life cycle at 15 °C. The most favourable temperature range for development was between 26 and 36 °C. There was a strong positive linear relationship between temperature and the rate of development of the egg and nymphal stages as well as total development. Nysius natalensis required temperatures above a lower threshold of 14.0 °C, 13.97, and 15.2°C 14.8 °C for completion of the egg and nymphal stages, respectively, and from egg to adult stage.

    "abstract": "Published distribution data, in the form of specimen collection records, for 23 species of Myrmeleontidae form the basis of this preliminary investigation into the protection of South African antlions. Two iterative priority area selection algorithms are used to: (1) determine near-minimum sets of sites for complete antlion species representation and (2) to assess the adequacy of the current reserve system for the conservation of selected antHon taxa. This is carried out by pre-selecting sites containing both antlion data and existing conservation areas and using these as starting points around which to select further sites in a complementary manner until species representation is complete. Priority areas for antlion conservation are concentrated in the southwestern regions of South Africa while areas of highest species richness are situated in the central Karoo and northwestern regions. Pre-selection of grid squares containing conservation areas results in decreased numbers of additional grid squares required for completing antHon representativeness, indicating that the existing reserves make some contribution to antlion conservation. The Fynbos, Nama-Karoo and Succulent Karoo biomes are shown to be important areas for antHon representation. These biomes have also been recognized as under-represented in the current conservation area system and as being of conservation importance for other taxa by various authors.",

Larvae of P. glaucum also have considerable ecological tolerance, accounting for the abundance and widespread distribution of the species in the Afrotropical Region.

For both species, the developmental times decreased with an increase in temperature. The degree days required to complete development from egg to adult were 212 and 256 above the estimated threshold temperatures of 9.6 °C and 9.0 °C for M. sjostedti and F. occidentalis, respectively. Between 19 and 23 generations of M. sjostedti and between 17 and 20 generations of F. occidentalis could possibly develop under Kenyan field conditions in one year. Overall mortality was lowest at 25 °C. Mortality rates for both species decreased from larval instars to adult and were higher for M. sjostedti than for F. occidentalis. Since the developmental times were not different, the differential pest status of M. sjostedti and F. occidentalis must be a result of other factors.",

For the histerid beetle, Carcinops pumilio (Erichson), increase in density had a damping effect on female fecundity and was inversely proportional to body size and mass of first and second instar larvae. Developmental time was inversely proportional to body size and mass of first and second instar larvae reared at densities of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 pairs of males and females. Survival of second instar larvae decreased with increase in density but increased with increase in body size. The rate of oviposition was directly proportional to body size and mass of the adult females. The results show that density will be a critical factor in any mass-rearing programme for this predator of fly larvae.",

Grape phylloxera was introduced to South Africa in the late 19th century and has caused considerable damage in this country, as elsewhere. A previous study suggested a single introduction to South Africa, independent of those in other viticultural regions of the globe. Here, a more extensive sampling of South African vineyards was obtained to test the hypothesis of a single introduction and infer the geographic and host plant source, or sources, of introductions. Genetic diversity was low, though in 36 samples 10 mitochondrial haplotypes were observed, seven unique and only two common. Some differentiation between grape phylloxera among the three populations was observed. Two clades were found, differing by a number of substitutions. Both these haplotype clades are closely related to grape phylloxera collected from the native grapevine, Vitis riparia, from the northern United States of America and Canada. The results suggest at least two introductions, and the differentiation of one of the South African haplotype clades from other introduced populations around the world suggests a direct introduction from the native range.",

The northern locust, S. g. gregaria, extends across the Sahara desert to western Asia. The invasion area of the southern subspecies, S. g. flaviventris, extends to Namibia, Angola, South Africa, Ascension Islands and Botswana. Four different locust populations were selected, three populations for the northern S. g. gregaria (f, e, r) from different localities and one population for the southern S. g. flaviventris (s). Three characters were selected, the length of the forewing (E), the length of the posterior femur (F), and the widest part of the head capsule (C). Two ratios (E/F, F/C) were also calculated and compared for the different populations. The univariate analysis technique using the ANOVA test was performed for the four locust populations. The means of the different measured characters and the two ratios indicated significant differences between the southern population and the other three northern populations. The mean values of E, F, C, and E/F ratio were lower for the southern population compared to the three northern populations. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the four locust populations were highly significantly different (P < 0.0001). Standardised canonical coefficients for the three characters and the two ratios were given. The Mahalanobis distance (D2) between the centroids of the different populations for the three measured characters and the two ratios were significantly different (P < 0.0001). The distances recorded between the southern and the three northern populations were higher than the distances between the three northern populations. The results indicated that the southern males and females are more morphologically closer to each other than to either sex of the northern locusts. Also, the two sexes of the northern populations are more or less similar in their morphological features than the southern locust population. We may suggest that the southern population may categorise an evolutionary dichotomy that has arisen on the African continent and may separate the two locust populations into two distinct species.",

Little is known about their daily activities and there have been controversies about the peak time of their activities. At four equal intervals (00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00), adult male and female Periplaneta americana (L.) (Blattodea: Blattidae), were captured and their guts removed and divided into three major regions: foregut, midgut, and hindgut. From each gut section, the presence and quantity of five enzymes (amylase, lipase, proteinase, glucosidase and cellulase) were analysed using standard methods. Result showed that all enzymatic activities (except cellulase) were at the highest level at 00:00, followed by 06:00, whereas at 18:00 the enzyme activities were the lowest. Amylase activities were 55.6, 50.7, 38.5 and 35.9 absorbance/min at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 sample periods, respectively. Amylase had the highest level of enzyme activity. The hindgut had the highest enzyme activities (except for cellulase) and the foregut had the least. Comparison of means showed that adult females of P. americana had a higher level of enzyme activity than males for all the enzymes except amylase. This study suggests that cockroaches are endowed with enzymes necessary for the digestion of the various diets, also there are variations in the daily activities of these enzymes, with the highest enzyme activities at night. This suggests that nocturnal insects not only restrict their activities at night, but also their internal physiological activities.",

    "abstract": "The Sahara is the largest desert in the world, spanning many regions and including a high diversity of landscapes (McGinnies et al. 1977). The faunal assemblages of large areas of the Sahara are still poorly known. Even in some relatively well-surveyed regions, e.g. northwestern Sahara (Pierre 1959; Joly et al. 1954) and the coastal region of western Sahara, very little is known yet about the insect fauna. Most information about the insect diversity for this region dates back to the first half of the last century (e.g. Escalera 1933; Espanol 1943, 1944, 1952), although some more recent monographs have included information on the subject (Schouten 1988). Increasing the knowledge of the insect fauna of this region is all the more crucial when some of these areas are protected, such as the Khnifiss Lagoon National Park in southwestern Morocco.",

No evidence could be found to suggest that undescribed species or even geographical variants exist. It is not a commonly encountered species and is usually found in low numbers. Although superficially similar to representatives of other genera, relationships within the subfamily will only be known once phylogenetic studies have been conducted. Tetrapomyia cyanea is widely distributed in South Africa, but most commonly encountered in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. While there is some evidence of an association with flowering plants, this may be indirect and relate to prey availability.",

The distribution of the four species is mapped, indicating that T. rhayaderi sp. n. has a disjunct distribution on the Zomba Plateau (Malawi) and coastal forests of Kenya; T. kinskii sp. n. is apparently restricted to Ntchisi Forest (Malawi), and T. kinskii sp. n. to the Rebeho (Usagara) Mountains in the Eastern Arc group. Tigrisomyia amnoni sp. n. is more widely distributed occurring from the West Usambara Mountains in the north of Tanzania to the Zomba Plateau in the Shire District of southern Malawi (and some intervening relict forests).

    "abstract": "Three insects were introduced into South Africa for the biological control of the alien invasive weed Hakea sericea Schrad. & J.C. Wendl. (Proteaceae) some 30 to 40 years ago. These agents included a fruit weevil, Erytenna consputa Pascoe (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a seed moth, Carposina autologa Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) and a shoot-boring weevil, Cydmaea binotata Lea (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). A strain of a local fungus, Colletotrichum acutatum (Penz) Sacc, has also been exploited as a mycoherbicide. Despite these biological control efforts, the weed still persists and forms dense monocultures that displace the natural vegetation. In 2001 permission was granted to release a stem-boring beetle, Aphanasium australe (Boisduval) (Cerambycidae), for the biological control of H. sericea in South Africa. The larvae of the beetle tunnel within the base of the stems and sub-surface roots of the tree and this is the first insect agent that has been introduced that can kill hakea trees. The collection of A. australe in Australia, culturing in quarantine, and the release techniques used to establish the beetle in South Africa are discussed. Aphanasium australe has established at half of the 23 release sites recently surveyed to determine establishment. It is concluded that although it is too early to predict the likely success of A. australe on H. sericea in South Africa, the prognosis is good given the early signs of mortality at some of the sites.",

Heavy infested fennel seeds were exposed to these MAs at 15, 25 and 35 °C combined with different exposure periods. The wasp emergence from the infested seeds exposed to MAs decreased gradually by increasing the exposure periods, CO2 or N2 contents and temperatures. MAs containing CO2 were more effective than those containing N2based on the reduction of the adult emergence. Complete reduction in emergence (100 % ) of CO2 treatments was recorded with 60, 70 and 80 % of CO2 at 35°C after 15 days of exposure. Meanwhile, in case of 97 and 98 % of N2, 25 days of exposure were needed to reach zero emergence at 25 and 35 °C. No effect was observed on the emergence of adult wasps from the infested seeds that were exposed to MAs containing 97 or 98 % of N2 at 15 °C.

    "abstract": "The savannah honeybee, Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier (Hymenoptera: Apidae), is a eusocial insect that forages for nectar and pollen on a variety of flowering plants. However, it is selective of plants from which it forages. The preferred species are called bee-plants. The concept of bee-plants recognises that flowers do not have the same pollen and nectar value to honeybees. Thus, the strength of honeybee colonies is dependent on the presence of bee-plants throughout the year at any given locality. A study was conducted during March 2013–February 2015 to establish the presence of bee-plants and their phenology within 2 km radius of the apiary at ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute's farm in Rietondale, a suburb of Pretoria. A total of 247 flowering plant species from 70 families, comprising indigenous and exotic trees, shrubs and grasses, was recorded during March 2013–February 2014. Most plant species flowered during April, a smaller proportion during February and October, and only a few during June. Flowers of each plant species were sampled in order to make reference pollen grain slides. To determine bee-plants, a pollen trap was fitted to the entrance of one of five Langstroth hives on a fortnightly rotation during March 2014–February 2015 in order to intercept pollen pellets from the hind legs of returning foragers. A total of 2403 pollen pellets were recovered, most of which (1263) were collected during April and none during October. At the laboratory, about a quarter of each pellet was dissolved in distilled water and pollen grain slides were prepared. These slides were matched against reference pollen grain slides using a compound microscope. It was established that honeybees foraged from only 30 plant species. During summer (December–February), pollen was collected mostly from Persicaria capitata (Polygonaceae), Tithonia rotundifolia (Asteraceae) during autumn (March-May), Acacia galpinnii (Fabaceae) during winter (June–August), and Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae) during spring (September–November). These results show that honeybees had access to pollen sources that were sufficient to sustain their colonies throughout the year. As bee-plants were continuously available in the vicinity of the Rietondale farm, this site could be ideal for urban beekeeping.",

Because sexual selection can cause rapid evolution of male genitalia in insects, particularly in widespread, polyphagous species, differences in the morphology of these structures among different populations may be evidence of divergence. Hence, variation in the shape of the valva in the male genitalia within and among three different populations of T. leucotreta was analysed using geometric morphometrics. Although some variation was detected among mean population values for certain traits, there was no overall pattern. Principal component analysis showed no distinct clustering of valval shape among populations, providing no evidence for divergence in genitalic structures, at least in the shape of the valva.",

    "abstract": "Rhinocyllus conicus is a flower-feeding weevil that has played a pivotal role in the biological control of several thistle species around the world. More recently it has achieved notoriety because of the damage it causes on several species of native thistles in North America. From 1984 to 1986, R. conicus was released for biological control of spear thistle, Cirsium vulgare, in three different regions of South Africa. Although the weevils have been established in the country since then, no proper surveys have been made to determine the extent of damage they are causing on C. vulgare. To redress the situation, samples of flower-heads from several localities were examined and damage due to R. conicus was recorded. The study showed that R. conicus has not dispersed more than 2.5 and 3.9 km from two of the original release sites where establishment was confirmed. The weevil is seldom particularly abundant (levels of damaged flower-heads exceeded 65 % at only two of 17 weevil-inhabited sites). Flower-heads set earlier in the season suffered higher levels of damage by the weevils, and infected flower-heads had significantly fewer seeds compared to uninfected flower-heads. All indications are that the contribution by R. conicus to biological control of C. vulgare in South Africa has been meagre due to unidentified constraints, at least in the two localized areas that the weevils currently occupy. Manual redistribution is required to determine whether or not other regions might be more suitable for R. conicus.",

While nestmates never showed aggression towards each other, the behaviour towards non-nestmates was either aggressive or non-aggressive, demonstrating the ability to recognize nestmates. Also, the nests in this aggregation were evenly spaced, further supporting the notion of territoriality in this species. To evaluate the relative importance of environment and genetics on the observed variation in nestmate recognition, we measured the spatial and genetic distances between nests. Workers of 13 nests were genotyped with the AFLP technique. Multiple regression analysis revealed no significant impact of spatial and genetic distance on aggressive behaviour. Thus, further studies are necessary to reveal the actual mechanisms underlying nestmate recognition in this species. Two distinct groups of nests with genetically homogeneous and heterogeneous workers were found, which may indicate gamergate replacement or colony fission.",

Information on the distribution, life cycle and larviposition of this ubiquitous flesh fly is presented. As facultative parasites, flies deposit microscopic larvae on the immobile bodies of locusts while they undergo ecdysis. Larvae enter the body cavities, consume the entire inner body contents and kill the locusts. Alternatively, the fly behaves as a saprozoic scavenger, attracted to decaying flesh and faecal matter. With parasitism rates of 0.1 % for fifth instar brown locust hoppers and 6 % for brown locust adult fledglings in the field, the impact of these facultative parasites on gregarious brown locust populations was low. However, a sharp increase of 37 % was registered after 48 hours when brown locust hopper bands, sprayed with a deltamethrin ultra low volume formulation (Decis® UL), were utilized as hosts. In the brown locust, this insecticide elicited a curious shade seeking response followed by a protracted paralysis, which W. pachytyli flies exploited. Despite the presence of relatively high deltamethrin residues, following spraying with Decis® UL, a heavy influx of flies regularly flew into spray areas and readily larviposited on sprayed hoppers. Resultant maggots successfully completed their life cycle within such toxic hosts. Since Decis® is in widespread use or brown locust control operations in the Karoo, such an abundance of additional paralysed hosts would result in a burgeoning W. pachytyli adult fly population, thereby enhancing parasitic potential. Paradoxically, the positive side-effects reported here on the impact of locust control operations with Decis® on a non-target, beneficial agent such as W. pachytyli, provides an anomalous example of a broad-spectrum insecticide actually benefiting a natural enemy.",

Although it has been widely recommended to farmers, limited data are available to demonstrate the efficacy of this method. The effects of crop sanitation on banana weevil populations and damage were studied in an on-station trial in Uganda. Treatments included low, moderate and high levels of sanitation. Banana weevil populations, estimated by trapping and mark and recapture methods, were lowest in the high sanitation treatment. However, banana weevil damage was either not significantly different among treatments or lower in low sanitation treatments. Similarly, increases in crop sanitation level were not reflected in higher yields. The data from this trial suggest that crop sanitation is not an effective means of managing banana weevil and contrasts with results from an on-farm study in which sanitation reduced both weevil numbers and damage.

For both species, age of egg did not affect progeny production but two-day-old B. fusca eggs yielded more progeny than S. calamistis eggs of the same age. With S. calamistis, development time of T. busseolae increased with age of eggs, while host species had no effect. Neither borer species nor age of eggs significantly affected the sex ratio. Longevity of T. busseolae was greater and total fecundity higher on B. fusca than S. calamistis. The intrinsic rate of increase and the net reproductive rate were greater with B. fusca than S. calamistis eggs as host. The values were considerably lower than those reported from the same species in West Africa, indicating that there are differences in strains between regions. Females begun ovipositing on the first day of emergence and the average daily number of eggs laid and the proportion of females decreased with age of the female, on both hosts. The ability of T. busseolae females to accept and develop in B. fusca and S. calamistis of different ages is an advantage, especially during times of host scarcity, which is common during the dry-season. In a Y- tube experiment no preference for either stemborer species was observed. Similarly, in the field, there was no significant variation in parasitism between B. fusca and S. calamistis eggs.",

Within the Allodapini, Macrogalea is the sister clade to all other extant allodapine species and is also morphologically the most primitive. Based on studies of two African species of Macrogalea, sociality has been assumed to be an ancestral trait for the entire tribe. We tested this assumption with the study of two species from Madagascar. Using nest content and dissection data, the social organization of two previously unstudied allodapine species, Macrogalea Ramena sp. and Macrogalea ellioti, were examined. The data suggest M. Ramena sp. and M. ellioti are both social, and although their social behaviour is less complex than the African species, phylogenetic conservatism is present within the Macrogalea. The form of sociality exhibited by Macrogalea is more primitive than that of other allodapines, with a more complex sociality possibly contributing to the success of these other allodapine clades.",

The recent capture of some B. tjederi specimens prompts this short report. Londt described B. tjederi from a relatively long series collected by a South African Museum expedition (Londt 1970), and later added a second record (Londt 1972). Londt (1978), in describing B. milleri, briefly discussed the interesting distribution of this species-group. A list of all known specimens of B. tjederi follows – exact label data being provided (lines of information separated by the symbol ‘/ ’). The exact coordinates of previously published localities are not known, and quarterdegree grid references are all that can safely be provided (in square brackets after the relevant place names). Published records. SOUTH AFRICA: 218 (including holotype), 169 (including allotype), ‘Goedehoop/Heidelberg [3420BB] Distr., /C.P.’, ‘Mus., Exped., /Oct. 1951’. Primary types and most of the paratypes are housed in the Iziko South African Museum, Cape Town. Two pairs of paratypes, originally stated as being in my personal collection, now form part of the Natal Museum’s collection in Pietermaritzburg (NMSA); 18, 29, ‘South Africa/Swellendam [3420AB]/14.11.1964/F. Honiball’ (18, 19 in Stellenbosch University collection, 19 in NMSA). New record: 48, 59, ‘South Africa: W Cape/Pat Busch Nature Reserve/33°46’17”S: 19°59’55”E/ 18-20.x.2005 JGH Londt / 317m Renosterbos / and rocky road verges’ (NMSA – pinned except for 18 preserved in ethanol for molecular analysis). A map of the distribution of species within the B. capensis group was published by Londt (1978). Bittacus smithersi is known only from the vicinity of Grahamstown, B. capensis has a wider distribution between Port Elizabeth and Knysna, B. tjederi is now known to occur between Heidelberg and Robertson, and finally B. milleri is found between Citrusdal and Clanwilliam. The species are accordingly allopatric, their combined distributions extending as a narrow band across the southern tip of South Africa, between c. latitude 32–34°S and c. longitude 19–27°E. Far more data are needed before it will be possible to establish the exact limits of each species so that the factors responsible for maintaining their separation can be understood. As far as B. tjederi is concerned, the new locality is of special interest as it is situated on the southern slopes of the Langeberg mountain range. While the exact coordinates of the collection sites involved in the ‘Goedehoop’ and ‘Swellendam’ material are not known, both centres (i.e. Heidelberg and Swellendam) also lie south of the Langeberg and within 15 km of the mountains. It is tempting to suggest that all three collecting localities probably lie in the southern foothills of the Langeberg which are relatively cooler and better vegetated than surrounding areas. This extensive mountain range effectively separates the Cape Floristic Region to the south from the Succulent Karoo Region to the north. It is possible that B. tjederi is confined to a relatively narrow area along the northern boundary of the Cape Floristic Region, well known internationally for its rich floral diversity (Van Wyk & Smith 2001). The Cape Floristic Region receives winter rainfall, while the more arid Succulent Karoo receives low summer rainfall. Bittacus tjederi, like the other species in the B. capensis group, has been collected mainly during October and November. This relatively short period of adult activity coincides with the end of the local rainy season and the beginning of warmer summer weather. Without exception, all the Pat Busch Nature Reserve specimens of B. tjederi were found hanging from the twigs of a group of bushes, identified as Ortholobium candicans (Eckl. & Zeyh.) C.H. Stirt, found growing along the verges of a sandy farm road (Fig. 1). These plants reach a height of about 2 m and have small c. 15 mm long, narrow, trifoliolate leaves borne on rather straight branches (Fig. 2). The c. 10 mm wide creamy white flowers were much in evidence at the time of the collec-",

    "abstract": "Anopheles funestus has long been recognized as a species complex containing both vectors and non-vectors of malaria (Gillies & De Meillon 1968). The sibling species can be separated with difficulty using morphological characters. A multiplex PCR assay was developed recently that accurately identifies the five most common members of the An. funestus group (Koekemoer et al. 2002). The correct identification of a sibling species within a species complex that contains both vectors and non-vectors is crucial in the clarification of the role of each individual species in malaria transmission (Garros et al. 2004). Anopheles funestus s.s. is known to be the most anthropophilic and endophilic member of the group and a highly efficient vector of malaria in Africa (Gillies & De Meillon 1968). The other species of the group are mainly zoophilic and only An. rivulorum has been found to be a minor malaria vector in Tanzania (Wilkes et al. 1996).",

Powders of the leaves and fruits of each plant were separately applied at concentrations of 1, 3 and 5% (w/w for powders) for biological assays. This was laid out in a completely randomised design with each treatment replicated four times. Results revealed that 3 and 5%powders of the three test plants led to significantly (P < 0.05) higher mortality of C. puncticollis as compared to 1 % (powders) and the control (0.0 for powder). The fruit powders were more effective than leaves. The effectiveness of these plant products on C. puncticollis was directly proportional to concentration, with higher concentration providing greater protection of the tubers. Powders of A. melegueta and X. aethiopica fruits at 5 % applications caused the highest significant mortality of C. puncticollis after 96 h.Adult emergence was also significantly higher in the control than in treated tubers with A. melegueta giving the lowest number of emerged adults. Quantitative analysis of the plant products revealed the presence of the active phytochemicals (alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, steroids, carotenoids and phenols) in various proportions, which may have caused the mortality of the pest in question on sweet potato in post-harvest storage at a small scale in Calabar, Nigeria.",

Therefore, an examination of the pea weevil population diversity and evolutionary history will provide insight into efficient pest management strategies. In this study, we sequenced and analysed a 393 bp fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from 29 samples of B. pisorum collected from the major pea-growing regions in northern Tunisia. Analysis of these sequences in addition to 18 supplementary sequences derived from six countries; Australia, China, Ethiopia, Germany, Italy and U.S.A.; led to the identification of 15 haplotypes among which nine were found in Tunisian samples, and among these, six were specific to Tunisia. The FST values reflected a weak population genetic diversity of B. pisorum in Tunisia. The haplotype network and phylogenetic analysis, including all sequences, supported the low genetic structuring of Tunisian B. pisorum and further revealed the presence of widely shared haplotypes. The presence of common haplotypes in geographically distant areas is mainly related to human intervention that facilitated the worldwide expansion of this pest, through the transportation of infested seeds, suggesting that local B. pisorum populations have different origins and may have resulted from multiple introductions.",

    "abstract": "Agronomic trials were conducted in central SouthAfrica to establish Amaranthus cruentus as a commercial grain crop. Knowledge of potential pest- and pathogen-related problems that might arise during cultivation is essential for future industry development. Previous studies linked fungi belonging to the genera Fusarium and Alternaria with weevil damage of leafy amaranth (A. hybridus). The aim of the present study was to conduct a disease survey to identify possible fungal association with weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and weevil damage in A. cruentus fields at Potchefstroom and Taung in the North-West Province, South Africa. Isolations were made from lesion margins, larval galleries of the weevil Hypolixus haerens, and stem lesions associated with the weevils Athesapeuta dodonis and Baris amaranthi. Weevil larvae associated with lesions as well as adults collected from plants in amaranth plots were euthanased and plated out onto fungal growth media. Fungi arising from the weevils were purified and identified to genus level based on morphology. Alternaria was predominantly isolated from leaf spots in contrast to Fusarium species that were isolated from root rot, cankered roots and stems. Fusarium species were by a considerable margin the dominant group associated with weevil damage and stem lesions, as well as larval tunnels, larval bodies and free living adults. Species of Cladosporium and Alternaria were also isolated from adult weevils with significant consistency. Other less dominant fungi isolated from adult weevils and larval tunnels included species of Aspergillus, Epicoccum, Humicola, Mucor, Penicillium, Rhizopus and Trichoderma. It is evident that Fusarium and Alternaria are the genera that host the most important and potentially dominant fungal pathogen taxa linked with grain amaranth disease symptoms and associated weevil pests. As such they will have to be investigated further in future.",

Phylogenetic analysis was constructed by neighbour-joining distance analysis showing that HSP70 putative peptide was clustered with other heat shock protein from the same species. 3-D structure modelling of HSP70 was employed. Transcriptional profiles of HSP70 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis after adult beetles were exposed to 45 °C, 4 °C and novaluron (insect growth regulator) for 60 min as physical and chemical stressors. HSP70 transcript was up-regulated at the highest level when adults were exposed to 45 °C for 60 min.

However, growers confuse fruit-piercing moths with fruit-sucking moths that do not cause primary damage. In this study we trapped these moths during the 2013–2015 growing seasons. A large number of diverse fruit-feeding moths were collected through weekly sampling in citrus orchards in the Eastern Cape and northern Limpopo provinces. Twenty-three species of fruit-feeding moth were trapped. However, only two were fruit-piercing species, capable of causing primary damage, namely Serrodes partita (Fabricius) (Erebidae) and Eudocima divitiosa (Walker) (Erebidae). Surprisingly S. partita, which has been reported as the main fruit-piercing moth pest of citrus in South Africa, comprised only 6.9 % of trap catches. The categorisation of moths as fruit-piercing or fruit-sucking (causing secondary damage) was confirmed by examining the morphological structures (tearing hooks and erectile barbs) of these moths' proboscides. This study has shown that in non-outbreak seasons, S. partita comprised only a small percentage of fruit-feeding moths in citrus orchards. However, growers may misidentify the harmless fruit-sucking species as fruit-piercing species, and thus overestimate the density of fruit-piercing moths.",

A high presence of this species was noted in both villages with 64 to 100 % of ovitraps being positive for eggs throughout the year. Monthly ovitrap productivity did not differ significantly between the two villages (t49 = –1.19, P >0.05), indicating their suitability to be used as paired sites. An important but unstable population of Ae. albopictus was also noted on the outskirt of Panchvati. The overall ovitrap productivity (for the three sites together) was highest from December to March (ranging from 101 to 272 eggs/ovitrap/week) and lowest from July to September (ranging from 13 to 126 eggs/ovitrap/week). Sterile releases could hence be initiated during the months of July to September when Ae. albopictus is at its lowest incidence and after ensuring that the species is still reproductively active during the low season. Moreover, before sterile males are released in Panchvati, the establishment of a buffer zone around the village must be contemplated to prevent the migration of feral females from the outskirt region. Ovitrap positivity and ovitrap productivity in both villages were positively correlated with temperature, relative humidity and rainfall while temperature was the major significant factor influencing oviposition, thereby highlighting the possibility of using meteorological variables to construct predictive models of vector incidence in the region.",

However, consequent harms to the environment, humans, animals and beneficial insects by these synthetic pesticides have driven a search for more sustainable integrated insect pest management (IPM) approaches, including the use of biological controls and neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) oil as alternatives to synthetic pesticides for the control of the pod-sucking bug Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stål on African cowpea crops. To date, however, no study to the authors' knowledge has investigated the compatibility and effectiveness of biological controls and neem approaches used together. In this study, we assessed the effects of two available preparations of neem oil (cold-pressed and hot-pressed) on the eggs of C. tomentosicollis and its parasitoid Gryon fulviventre Crawford. The main results of the study support the hypothesis that both cold-pressed and hot-pressed neem oil sprays are compatible with biological/IPM control efforts using G. fulviventre. While hot-pressed neem showed stronger effects on levels of egg hatchability and mortality for C. tomentosicollis compared to cold-pressed neem, no differences in outcomes across tested neem concentrations were observed. Future research, including field trials, will have the potential to elucidate any underlying mechanisms of these results and/or to more exactly identify appropriate concentrations needed to successfully integrate biological and non-synthetic controls for major cowpea pests in Africa.",

The concentration of A. indica and O. suave required to cause 50 % mortality of adult house fly was 0.066/50 ml water at 3.4 h and 0.072/50 ml at 3.8 h, respectively, while the concentration of the mixed oils at equal proportion (50:50) required to cause 50 % mortality of house fly was less (0.065/50 ml water) and at 3.4 h. This study has therefore revealed the potency of the plant oil extracts (A. indica and O. suave) as single and mixed at equal proportion (50:50) against house fly (M. domestica). However, the formulation of the mixed plant oil required to cause 50 % mortality of the house fly was less, showing higher potential over the single formulations. Therefore using the mixed plant extracts is recommended for the proper management of house fly.",

    "abstract": "The first epidemic of dengue occurred in Burkina Faso in 1925 and the most recent in 2016. However, there is little available information on the bio-ecology of the main dengue vector and the prevalence of the disease in the country. For better understanding the entomological situations of the main dengue vector Aedes aegypti during the last epidemic of dengue, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso from November to December 2016. The goals of this study included: i) searching for water containers, and classifying them according to their type and location (indoors or outdoors); ii) examining the containers for the presence of Aedes larvae and iii) evaluating the susceptibility to insecticides mainly used in public health. Our results showed that discarded artefacts and automobile parts filled with rain water were breeding grounds for Ae. aegypti while indoor containers were mud pots (domestic purposes). The other breeding sites were metal drums, paraffin tins and mud pots. Moreover, the adults of Ae. aegypti population from these breeding sites were resistant to organochlorines, carbamates and pyrethroids, but fully susceptible to organophosphates. Our data could provide useful information for national programmes in strategy development.",

Differences were found in the beetle species richness and abundance among the sampled shrubs and the years of study. The data of the species traits as habitat affinity, food preference and flying ability show that xerophilic, carnivorous and macropterous species dominate in both shrub habitats. In the Atriplex halimus habitat, which has a dense vegetation cover and high humidity conditions, granivorous and hygrophilous species were more numerous. Analysis revealed a significant correlation between beetle abundance and inter-annual rainfall change and a low affinity between the species assemblages of both shrub habitats. Our results suggest that shrub size and species identity play an important role in structuring ground beetle communities.",

    "abstract": "Busseola fusca and Fusarium verticillioides are considered the most important pest and pathogen, respectively, of maize in South Africa. Busseola fusca tunnels into stems and ears of maize plants, whereas F. verticillioides causes Fusarium ear rot and deposits fumonisins in maize kernels. Frass (excreta) deposited by B. fusca larvae in maize stems and ears during feeding could potentially be contaminated with pathogens such as F. verticillioides, thereby indirectly and passively contributing to plant diseases. The mycoflora present in frass of B. fusca larvae was thus investigated in this study, and the dissemination of fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. by B. fusca larvae in maize stems determined. Busseola fusca frass was collected from plants with visible insect damage in three maize-growing districts in South Africa. The mycoflora in the frass was isolated and identified morphologically to genus level, followed by the sequencing of target genes for species identification. Species of Acremonium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Mucor, Rhizopus and Talaromyces were associated with the B. fusca frass. The role of B. fusca larvae in disseminating fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. was then determined in greenhouse and field trials. Maize whorls were inoculated with F. verticillioides MRC826 spores 4 weeks after plant emergence, and infested with B. fusca larvae 2 days later. The stems were split open after 3 weeks and frass collected from feeding channels, thereafter, target DNA of fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. was quantified using real-time PCR. Target DNA of fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. was significantly higher in frass collected from greenhouse plants inoculated with F. verticillioides than in frass collected from the uninoculated control, indicating that the inoculation was successful in the absence of soil-borne inoculum. Nevertheless, the field trial showed no significant differences in target DNA in frass from inoculated and non-inoculated plants. This is possibly due to natural F. verticillioides infection of maize plants in the field. This study further indicated that B. fusca frass also contained maize pathogens such as Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp., which could cause ear rot diseases. The occurrence of Acremonium zeae in frass has potential implications for the biological control of F. verticillioides, as the fungus produces pyrrocidines A and B antibiotics which are known to be antagonistic to F. verticillioides. The occurrence of Aspergillus niger in frass requires further investigation in order to clarify its role in fumonisin contamination of maize in South Africa.",

Entomopathogens are effective in controlling soil-borne and above-ground stages of insect pests. Soil samples were collected from deciduous fruit orchards and vineyards in the Western Cape, baited with mealworms to isolate entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), which were identified using molecular techniques and assessed for their potential as biocontrol agents of BFW adults. A correlation analysis was performed to determine the effect of soil parameters on the presence of the entomopathogens. EPNs were trapped in 12 (17 %) samples, while Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Heterorhabditis safricana were the only two species isolated. EPF were isolated from 26 (37 %) samples baited, with 14 fungal isolates identified as Beauveria bassiana (Cordycipitaceae) and 12 identified as Metarhizium anisopliae (Clavicipitaceae) complex. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (53 %) gave significantly higher (P < 0.05) control of adult BFW than H. safricana (37 %). Metarhizium anisopliae (79 %) gave significantly higher (P < 0.05) control of BFW adults than B. bassiana (63 %). Organic matter, magnesium and phosphorus had a negative relationship with the occurrence of EPNs. A negative relationship was also reported between the occurrence of EPF, and organic matter and potassium. The results indicated that soils from the deciduous fruit orchards and vineyards from the Western Cape contain both EPNs and EPF with potential to be used in an integrated pest management system against soil-borne and above-ground stages of BFW.",

    "abstract": "Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), is an endemic pest in Tunisia and is among the most destructive biotic stresses of commercial cereals. Genes in wheat that confer resistance to this insect provide the most efficient and economical means of crop protection. Yet, attempts to breed for resistant cereal genotypes are hampered by the periodic emergence of virulent pest biotypes that are unaffected by the plant's resistance factors in use. Therefore, it is crucial to undertake permanent surveys in order to establish baseline information on the status of germplasm resources. A survey of infestation was conducted during the growing season 2011/2012, over the four most important cereal-growing provinces of Tunisia (Béja, Jendouba, Kef and Siliana), which highlighted variation in the incidence and severity of attacks between regions and periods of the year. We recorded two intense outbreaks occurring in early March and late April, suggesting that eradication should be applied in the month of February to hinder the development of subsequent generations. Unlike this constancy in the insect biological rhythm, the genetics of its physiological interaction with the cereal host seems to be altered by mutations leading to the development of new virulent strains. When testing 25 cereal genotypes to infestation by Hessian fly in Béja, Jendouba and Kef, we found that the bread wheat cultivar ‘Salambo 80’ was susceptible. This genotype was resistant to Hessian fly in North Tunisia ten years before. In contrast to ‘Salambo 80’, bread wheat ‘Mahon 73’ was characterized by stable resistance across different infestation circumstances, indicating that it would provide a solution for breeding against the Hessian fly races currently prevailing in North Tunisia. The herein reported results represent an additional step of a long-term effort that should be maintained and updated to keep up with the co-evolutionary dynamics associating cereals to their feeding fly, and stay continuously alerted of biotype development.",

The results showed that the product exhibits a high level of toxicity with a dose-response relationship. The enzymatic analyses of the treated adults of B. orientalis with the determined LC50 dose revealed a neurotoxic activity of spinosad, with an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and a stimulation of the detoxification system that is interpreted by the increase of glutathione-S-transferase activity. In other experiments the compound was applied at LC50 on a newly emerged females and its effect was investigated on reproduction during the first gonadotrophic cycle (0, 2, 4 and 6 days) and the ovarian protein contents. The results showed that spinosad reduced the number of oocytes per paired ovaries, the size of basal oocytes and the ovarian protein contents.",

    "abstract": "False codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an important pest of citrus and subtropical fruit in South Africa, not only because it can cause pre-harvest crop losses, but as it is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, certain export markets consider it of quarantine importance (Stibick 2008; Timm et al., 2010; EPPO 2013). Consequently, a wide range of measures are employed to control the pest in agricultural systems (Moore & Hattingh 2012). Use of Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CrleGV-SA) has been suggested as a suitable biological control method for FCM (Opoku-Debrah 2011). This control agent is a baculovirus that is ingested by larvae and caught in the columnar cells of the midgut (Jehle 2002; Jehle et al. 2003). Since baculoviruses are highly virulent and host specific, they are ideal agents for biological control (Opoku-Debrah 2011). However, like many biological control agents their performance can be erratic, since their interaction with their hosts can be influenced by a number of variables, including temperature (Kirkman 2007).",

The hitherto unknown male of C. walkeri is described here (and the female redescribed) based on material collected in South Africa since 1970. Culicoides walkeri can be distinguished from other plain-wing species in its pale ochreous colour, the robust shape of the male genitalia, and the sensilla coeloconica distribution which, uniquely, is the same in both sexes (occurring on flagellomeres 1–12). Though the feeding habits of C. walkeri are not known, its greatly inflated third palpal segment and the copious number of sensilla found on the flagellum, indicate it to be ornithophilic. Culicoides walkeri would appear to be confined to the frost-free savannas of the eastern length of Africa, from the equator southwards; its limited distribution in South Africa is mapped and shows that this uncommon species is confined to the Central Bushveld, the Lowveld and the Mopane bioregions. We propose that C. walkeri remain unplaced to subgenus.",

Neonates penetrate the tap root at the base of the stem within a few hours of hatching, presenting a brief window for control of an otherwise highly cryptic pest. Several systemic and contact/stomach insecticides as well as the entomopathogenic fungus, Nomuraea rileyi, were evaluated from 2005–2012 on 6–8-month-old plantations of A. linearis. A strategy based on prophylactic applications of a contact/stomach insecticide (active ingredient: Esfenvalerate) during early to midNovember resulted in > 97 % control. This level of control was realized following delivery of 10 ml aliquots of a 0.4 % concentration of the chemical to the stem-base of individual plants. Attempts at biological suppression of M. candescens with N. rileyi proved unsuccessful. Commercial-scale application of the chemical was possible through the development of an automated measured-dose applicator (vehicle-mounted) consisting of multiple nozzle-lines carried/directed individually by operators. The stem-directed application strategy developed here implies reduced chances of the chemical coming into contact with leaves (and twigs) to be harvested early in the following year, minimum environmental pollution and/or little to no impact on beneficial insects residing on the plant.",

    "abstract": "Malaria vector control by indoor residual spraying (IRS) in South Africa currently relies on the use of DDT to control pyrethroid-resistant populations of the major malaria vector Anopheles funestus. Pyrethroid resistance in An. funestus in South Africa and Mozambique is primarily based on the over-production of monooxygenase P450 genes. Preliminary evidence suggests that the pyrethroid-resistant phenotype is primarily expressed in adults, raising questions as to how resistance was selected for in the field given that there was no malaria control targeting adults in southern Mozambique when this resistant phenotype was first discovered there. The aim of this study therefore was to select for pyrethroid resistance at the larval or adult stages in southern African An. funestus and then assay the pyrethroid susceptibility of subsequent life stages using samples of progeny from the pyrethroid-resistant selections. There was no significant variation between the lethal permethrin concentrations inducing 50% mortality (LC50s) of larvae from three An. funestus colonies, but highly significant variation in the lethal dosages inducing 50% mortality (LD50S) of adults. It was not possible to enhance adult resistance/tolerance to permethrin by one round of selection at either the larval or adult stages in any of the colonies, although larval tolerance to permethrin can be enhanced by selection at the larval stage. It is concluded that monooxygenase-based pyrethroid resistance in southern African An. funestus is primarily expressed in the adult stage and that this particular resistance haplotype can only be selected by exposing adult mosquitoes to pyrethroids. This has important implications for malaria vector control in southern Africa because it suggests that the pyrethroid resistance in An. funestus populations in South Africa and southern Mozambique was selected for by private pyrethroid use directed against adult mosquitoes.",

Low temperature is one of the most important factors influencing the invasion and colonization of L. invasa. However, effects of diel temperature fluctuations (e.g. rapid cold-hardening (RCH)) on survival of L. invasa are less well understood. Here, we investigated the survival and differentially expressed proteins of L. invasa adults' response to different pre-treatment protocols. Survival of adults exposed at -20 °C decreased from 100 % (0 min and 15 min) to 5 ± 2 % (45 min). Survival of L. invasa adults, exposed at -20 °C for 45 min, was the highest at the pre-treatment temperature of 4 °C for 90 min. Mass spectrometry analysis and database searching helped us to identify a total of 85 proteins that exhibited differential expression, in which up-regulated expression of 28 proteins and down-regulated expression of 57 proteins were observed in comparison with control. Up-regulated proteins were members of heat shock proteins and ribosomal proteins, while down-regulated proteins were members of energy metabolism and degradation. In conclusion, RCH could enhance the cold hardiness of L. invasa adults.Theadaptive responsemayallow L. invasa to invade the extreme environment in the world.",

    "abstract": "Ants are almost ubiquitous, exhibit high species diversity and are functionally important insects. Thanks to these traits and the large numbers easily collected by pitfall trapping, ants have been frequently used in biodiversity and conservation studies (e.g. Samways 2005; Schoeman & Foord 2012) and as indicator species in rehabilitation projects (Majer & De Kock 1992; Andersen & Majer 2004; van Hamburg et al. 2004; Netshilaphala et al. 2005). Nevertheless, as with any indicator taxon, knowledge of distributions, patterns of seasonal activity and abundance is essential to make insightful inferences from differences in trap catches. Since the ant fauna of the arid regions of South Africa has not been well documented, and there have been few studies of the biology and ecology of dominant or important species, the use of ants as indicators is severely hampered by this lack of knowledge. In a country impacted heavily by various kinds of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g. land clearing, exotic livestock grazing and locust control operations), it is vital that the limited knowledge base concerning the composition and habitat requirements of the endemic ant fauna be improved so they can be used more effectively as indicators of ecosystem health and disturbance.",

The study was laboratory based and the insects were observed in cages containing French bean pods as their food. Data show that mating incidences were approximately four times more prevalent during scotophase than photophase with a peak at mid scotophase. Diel oviposition curve had a major peak at late photophase and a minor one at late scotophase; and approximately twice more eggs were laid during photophase than scotophase. Nymphal feeding patterns had extended peaks between 18:00 and 0:00, with approximately twice as many nymphs feeding during scotophase than during photophase. Adult feeding pattern was different from that of nymphs, i.e. it was unaffected by time of day or light and darkness, probably because the adults had to balance feeding with mating and oviposition.",

    "abstract": "Since 2000, the groundnut leaf miner has increasingly become a pest of groundnut and soya bean on the African continent. The origin of the pest in Africa is uncertain. Early reports in South Africa assumed it was an invasion of Aproaerema modicella (Deventer) from the Asian continent, but subsequent mitochondrial DNA COI gene (mtDNA COI) fingerprinting matched it to Aproaerema simplexella (Walker, 1864) from Australia. Prior to this, reports in the 1950s recorded it in Africa under the name Stomopteryx subsecivella (Zeller, 1852). Furthermore, it was found that A. simplexella responded to the species-specific lure developed from the sex pheromone of A. modicella. As a result of these apparent anomalies, we examined the genetic relatedness of the above species fromAfrica, India andAustralia.mtDNACOI analysis was performedon 44 specimens collected from SouthAfrica, four from Mozambique, and three each from single locations in India and Australia. In the BOLD gene bank, 70 % of the specimens analysed matched with A. simplexella sequences from Australia (99–100 %), including all three specimens from both India and Australia, and two from Mozambique. In the remaining specimens, the match was 98–99 %. Two specimens, later to be identified as parasitoids, did not match with any sequences in the BOLD gene bank. In the NCBI gene bank, 81 % of the sequences matched 99–100 %, and a further 15 % matched 92–98 % with A. simplexella sequences. Based on these mtDNA COI analyses, and the similarities of the behavioural responses originally noted between the species, we thus suggest the re-examination of the taxonomy and synonymisation of the three populations of the two species.",

We evaluated the attractiveness and toxicity of six commercial baits containing hydramethylnon, imidacloprid and pyriproxyfen targeting Argentine ants, and differing in bait formulation. Hydramethylnon granular baits were most effective, killing workers (85–100% worker mortality) and queens (63–75 %) in the laboratory within 24 h. Workers were most attracted to and consumed the most of the imidacloprid gel bait, but, contrary to previous studies, mortality on this bait was low. The pyriproxyfen bait was least effective in killing workers, as was expected, and was the least consumed of all baits.We advocate the use of a fine granular hydramethylnon formulation for the effective control of Argentine ants. The attractiveness and consumption of the gel formulation was encouraging, therefore increased concentrations of the toxicant imidacloprid in gel formulation should be tested for improved bait efficacy. Combinations of toxicants that act on multiple levels, such as the larvicide pyriproxyfen and the respiratory toxicant hydramethylnon, should be tested in order to maximise colony eradication from brood to queens.",

    "abstract": "Hylastes angustatus (Herbst) is a bark beetle that is an important though sporadic pest of commercially grown Pinus species in South Africa. It usually develops in pine logs that have been felled or otherwise damaged. The adult beetles are attracted to these logs by volatile chemicals produced by the damaged tissues. Host location and aggregation behaviour of H. angustatus were investigated in the laboratory using multiple-choice trials. The beetle prefers P. elliottii to P. patula, roots to stems, high to low beetle densities and bark treated with ethanol and/or low concentrations (1 %) of monoterpenes. Hylastes angustatus appears to prefer hosts or parts of the plant with higher nutrient and moisture contents. Ethanol and low concentrations of monoterpenes are potentially useful attractants for monitoring H. angustatus populations in the field. The standard practice of replanting Pinus lots immediately after felling is not recommended.",

One percent of Tragus koelerioides Aschers., 7.5 % of Eragrostis obtusa Munro ex Fix. & Hiern. and 58 % of the Eragrostis superba Peyr. Seeds foraged were discarded on the refuse heaps. The nitrogen content of refuse heap soil was greater (0.15 %) than that of 0-3 cm topsoil in the adjacent veld (0.08 %). This, together with the viable seeds in the refuse heaps, contributed to increased density of plant cover on the nest. Colonies migrate, and the cycle of foraging, increase in plant cover and migration is continually repeated. The foraging pattern of M. capensis contributes to seed dispersal, a dense plant cover and progression towards a climax plant community.",

Males of the two species showed a strong spatial separation in perching position relative to vegetation type, perch height and distance to the banks. The proportion of males actively engaged in reproduction rose significantly with time of day but was independent of total male density and the relative importance of either patrolling or perching behaviour. Males of both species were found to be non-territorial, which is exceptional for the genus Pseudagrion. This is discussed relative to high territory retention costs at high dragonfly densities.",

Parasitoids (Hymenoptera : Braconidae) and Dorylus helvolus (Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera : Formicidae) were sampled at regular intervals in field trials. Two braconid species, Bracon sesamiae Cameron and Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron), were found to parasitize both B. fusca and C. partellus larvae in maize and sorghum. Two other species, Euvipio sp. and Bracon (Habrobracon) brevicornis (Wesmael), were reared from B. fusca larvae. Bracon sesamiae was the most abundant and widespread of the four larval parasitoids. Pupal parasitism was rare. Egg parasitism was not observed. Dorylus helvolus was found to be an important and widely distributed predator of both B. fusca and C. partellus larvae. Parasitism of B. fusca by B. sesamiae was higher in sorghum than in maize. Parasitism levels were generally low during the season except during April and May, when 21 % and 31 % parasitism was recorded on sorghum in the 1995 / 96 and 1996 / 97 seasons, respectively. Because the activities of natural enemies increased only towards the end of the growing season, they are unlikely to exert a pronounced effect on stemborer populations during the growing season. They may, however, play an important role in reducing the size of overwintering populations.",

The first, second and third generation flights usually peaked in November, February and April, respectively. The observed differences between the low-lying areas and the mountains, both in terms of cessation of seasonal flight activity and number of generations per year, were attributed to variations in the duration of the growing season (longer in the lowlands than in the mountains).

However, adult reproductive development trials indicated that some of these species were relatively inferior in supporting the development of the female reproductive system. Furthermore, the adults preferred L. camara as a host plant when the related species were simultaneously exposed in a multi-choice situation. The preliminary host specificity results suggests that T. vulgata may have a host range that is suitably narrow to justify its release in South Africa, but further choice trials will be required before permission for release is sought.

The study was conducted in Kenya top-bar hives placed at two locations in Ogun State, Nigeria. The first location was at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, and the second was Olupakun village, Ogun State. There were two treatments; the first was the parent hives from where four top-bars with queen bee, brood cells, some worker bees, and drones were removed and replaced with four empty top bars. The second treatment was uncolonized hives (nuclei) that received the top bars with queen bee, brood cells, some worker bees and drones. The control was colonized and undisturbed Kenya top-bar hives. The treatment and control hives were replicated four times and arranged using completely randomized design, with each hive placed at a distance of 50 m apart. Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance and significant means were separated using least significant difference. The honey yield, weight of dried pressed comb, number of combs with brood cells and total number of combs were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 2010. Likewise, the honey yield, weight of dried pressed comb, number of ripe harvested honey combs, number of combs with brood cells and total number of combs were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Olupakun village. Bee colonies were established in the parent and nuclei hives. A significantly (P < 0.05) higher honey yield, propolis yield, weight of dried pressed comb, number of ripe harvested combs and number of combs with brood cells was obtained in the control hives.

    "abstract": "Diverse systems with distinctive approaches characterized the presentations in the Insect Gut Physiology and Nutrition Symposium, held during the Fourth International Conference in Africa for Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry at Mara, Kenya, in July 2008. Within the broad topic of insect nutrition, symposium talks examined the feeding behaviour and plant preference of mosquitoes, the effects of dietary levels of protein on grasshopper reproduction and longevity, and the dependence of honeybee survival on certain dietary components. Gut physiology was represented by a sophisticated study of membrane potential in the springtail, the gut as a point of infection for Sindbis virus in mosquito, and a study of the gut transcriptome and proteome of a coleopteran storage pest. A study of chemical ecology described methods currently being used in Kenya to control locust damage to crops. These presentations provided unique perspectives of insect nutrition and gut physiology as related to insect control or improved understanding of beneficial insects.",

    "abstract": "After our recent revision of the Afrotropical species of Ootheca Chevrolat, 1837, and the description of Oothecoides Kortenhaus & Wagner, 2011, five galerucine species that are closely related to Ootheca and form a distinct monophyletic group, need to be transferred to a new genus, Ootibia gen. n. Two of these species have already been described in the genus Ergana Chapuis, 1879, a junior synonym to Ootheca. New combinations are Ootibia podagrica (Laboissière, 1939), the genotype of the new genus, and Ootibia bimbina (Laboissière, 1939) stat. n., originally described as a subspecies of the former E. podagrica. Three new species are described: Ootibia bredoi sp. n., Ootibia striata sp. n., and Ootibia viridis sp. n. Species of Ootibia gen. n. are characterized by a broad body shape with a broad pronotum, convex dorsum, short antennae and legs, similar to those of Ootheca. Males show characteristic sexual dimorphism in the shape and length of the metatibia. Genitalic structures, in particular the distinctive shape of median lobe, allow reliable species identification. Descriptions or redescriptions are given for each of the five species, including semi-schematic illustrations depicting the habitus outline, colouration, shape of the basal antennomeres and the median lobe. The material examined is listed in detail, and photographs of the name-bearing types, distribution maps and a key to the species are provided.",

Insects were collected on three Solanum species in the Transvaal and on 10 in Namibia. Solanum panduriforme E. Mey. and S. incanum L. were abundant in both regions, while S. capense L. was the most common species in Namibia. These three Solanum species supported an abundance of insect herbivores, which included many oligophages found on solanurns in other regions of South Africa. Most of the Solanum insect species were found on a wide range of host plants, in a variety of habitats and under various climatic conditions. The extensive oligophagy among indigenous solanaceous insects has implications for introduced Solanum species and these are discussed. Although indigenous solanaceous insect species readily develop on the introduced crop S. melongena L. (eggplant), none attack the exotic weeds S. elaeagnifolium Cav. and S. sisymbriifolium Lam., except superficially. The taxonomic relationships between the introduced and indigenous Solanum species may account for these discrepancies. The surveys further emphasize the need to introduce natural enemies into South Africa for biological control of exotic Solanum weeds.",

Recently, Mesoplatys ochroptera Stal (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) has become a serious pest of Sesbania species in agroforestry systems in Africa. The biology of M. ochroptera was studied in eastern Zambia and southern Malawi. Sesbania bispinosa (Jacq.) Wight, S. brevipedunculata Gillet, S. leptocarpa DC, S. macrantha Phil. & Hutch., S. rostrata Bremek & Obrem, S. sericea (Willd.) Link, S. sesban (L.) Merr. and S. tetraptera Hochst. ex Baker were the primary hosts of M. ochroptera in the study area. Females laid on average one egg batch per day in an oviposition period of 18-56 days. Egg batches contained 2-70 eggs. Females that were mated repeatedly produced about 1000 offspring while those mated only once produced 980 offspring. Larval development through three instars, took between 11-34 days. Pupal development occurred in the soil, and took 4-16 days. The survival and developmental periods of pre-imaginal stages differed significantly between the Sesbania species studied. The highest and lowest pre-imaginal survival was recorded on S. leptocarpa and S. rostrata, respectively. The longest developmental period of about 32 days was recorded on S. sesban while the shortest of 14 days was on S. leptocarpa. Annual activity cycle in M. ochroptera followed the unimodal rainfall pattern of southern central Africa. Beetles were only active during the rainy season (November-April) with a single population peak between February and April. Adults overwintered within and around the sesbania fallows during the long dry season (May-October) and emerged with the onset of the rains.",

In this study we used theoretical and empirical models to describe the spatial pattern of the Afrotropical leaf beetles Mesoplatys ochroptera Stal, Exosoma and Ootheca spp. defoliating the agroforestry tree (Sesbania sesban (L.) Merril). We used the Poisson, negative binomial distribution (NBD), Taylor's power law and Iwao's mean crowding models to determine (1) intraspecific spatial patterns and conspecific interactions within a population, (2) interspecific interaction between their populations, and (3) derive a common sampling plan for the three species. The spatial patterns of larvae and adult M. ochroptera were adequately described by the negative binomial, while those of Exosoma and Ootheca fitted the Poisson distribution. Taylor's power law gave very good fit (r2 >0.80) except for Ootheca in Zambia, while Iwao's mean crowding gave poor fit to the spatial pattern of M. ochroptera larvae and Ootheca. The slopes of the variance-mean relationships were significantly greater than unity for adults and larvae of M. ochroptera, indicating aggregated distribution, while those for Exosoma and Ootheca were closer to unity, indicating spatial randomness. The three species showed random association with varying degrees of niche overlap. Therefore, the null hypothesis of spatial independence between the populations of M. ochroptera and Exosoma, and adult M. ochroptera and Ootheca was rejected. Hence, a common sampling plan was developed for estimation of the population densities of the three species at the same time.",

Morphological and molecular methods were used to identify all the species obtained from cultivated olives at two trial sites near Stellenbosch and Agter-Paarl. Eupelmus spermophilus Silvestri (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) was by far the most frequent and widespread olive seed wasp. Monitoring with yellow sticky traps over three seasons indicated OSW presence in orchards when olives were small enough for OSW to oviposit in, but traps were not reliable indicators of OSW infestation levels. Prematurely dropped olives, collected from February until harvest over three seasons, and olives picked at harvest were examined for OSW infestation. Total yield for each data tree was recorded at harvest, and yield loss due to OSW infestation calculated. Economically significant yield losses occurred sporadically. Fruits collected from both cultivated and wild olive trees indicated that OSW occurs in most olive-growing regions of the Western Cape. OSW does not pose a significant threat to the local olive industry as a whole and cannot be considered a key pest of olives, but during some seasons it can affect production yields where wild olive trees are located near commercial olive groves.",

Very few studies have focused on the ability of this pest to develop on S. macrostachya seeds. The objective of this study was to determine some bio-demographic parameters of C. furcatus on the seeds of S. macrostachya. The results of this study showed that the peak of female oviposition occurs on the second day after emergence. The female laid during her lifetime, an average of 37 eggs of which an average of 35 hatched, while larval survival until imago was 87.14 %. The weight and size of emerged adults did not differ statistically by sex. However, the sex ratio was female-biased. The mean development time for C. furcatus to complete its development on the seeds of S. macrostachya was 50 days. With a population that doubles every 4.75 days, C. furcatus could cause significant damage to the seed stocks of S. macrostachya.",

Kiwifruit is imported as fresh fruit and propagation material from various countries. This study aimed to analyse the risk posed by these mites associated with the importation of kiwifruit over a period of 11 years (2009–2019). The majority of mite interceptions were associated with fresh fruit (97 %) mainly from Italy. Five mite species were recorded: Brevipalpus obovatus, B. chilensis, B. hondurani, B. lewisi and a new, undescribed species in genus Brevipalpus. The majority of specimens intercepted belonged to the new species. Any species not present in South Africa, particularly this Brevipalpus sp. nov., may pose a potential threat to South Africa's agricultural and horticultural industries and environment as well as biodiversity. The introduction of these species is a major phytosanitary concern because these polyphagous Brevipalpus spp. could find favourable conditions for their survival, development, reproduction and dispersal since South Africa is a country of diverse environmental conditions and various host plants.",

Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the second most cultivated cereal after durum wheat (Triticum durum), the latter being often subject to attack from various storage pests. To address this issue, phosphine fumigations are used most of the time. Unfortunately, these types of conventional pesticides have caused the emergence of resistant insect populations, and represents a real danger for the environment and human health. The objective of this study is the introduction of a sustainable biological solution to control Rhyzopertha dominica F. (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae) populations using the essential oil of Ocimum gratissimum. To this end, O. gratissimum essential oil was extracted by steam distillation, then chemically characterised by CGMS. A preliminary study was conducted to demonstrate its insecticidal effects on adults of R. dominica. The impact of the extracted essential oil was also estimated on the mineral fraction and the physicochemical and rheological properties of healthy soft wheat flour, R. dominica infested flour, and treated wheat. After 30 days of incubation, the results showed that the essential oil is active by fumigation. The LD50 is 14.36 (µl/l air) for a TL50 of 153.690 h. The repellent effect was estimated at 64.44 %. The essential oil does not affect the rheological and physicochemical characteristics of the flour, which remain compliant with ISO standards. The mineral fraction showed no significant differences at P-values < 0.05.",

We describe field-testing of this chemical, which is the first such test for any putative tsetse larviposition pheromone. We replicated randomised block experiments at 11 sites near Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. Each site comprised a cluster of four artificial warthog burrows constructed from 200-litre steel drums. We placed six trays, filled with sand and covered with leaf litter, inside each burrow. Both species of tsetse inhabiting this region entered these artificial burrows and deposited 1282 pupae in the trays during the experiments. In 13 experiments, n-pentadecane was tested at three different concentrations against a control. We were unable to find any conclusive evidence that the presence of n-pentadecane resulted in an increased larviposition rate for either G. m. morsitans or G. pallidipes. This finding was independent of the concentration of n-pentadecane used, and was not influenced by the presence or absence of added water, acetone or warthog urine. Any small effect of the pheromone is likely masked by the important physical characteristics of burrow larviposition sites. Order of magnitude increases in larviposition rates when leaf litter was added to larviposition sites were far greater than those due to the use of putative larviposition pheromones.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide losses of stored and post-harvested products are mainly due to insect attacks. Although conventional pesticides are widely applied to control pest invasions, there has been an increasing pressure to reduce reliance on conventional pesticides in the interests of avoiding health and environmental consequences. In this work, the effect of ingested Makisterone A, which is a phytoecdysteroid, was tested on the major insect pest of stored products, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). Firstly, the effect of this molecule on post-embryonic development parameters (mortality, pupation and adult emergence) was tested after ingestion at 300, 600, 900 and 1200 ppm. Secondly, the effect of the Makisterone A was also tested on the biochemical parameters (proteins, alpha-amylase, detoxification enzymes). Ingestion of Makisterone A by T. castaneum larvae induced mortality and significantly reduced pupation and adult emergence rates. Our results show that the level of proteins decreases significantly (P < 0.001) in larvae treated with Makisterone A in comparison with the controls in a dose-dependent manner. Protein content was 176.94, 106.72, 93.16 and 39.32 µg/larva, respectively for 300, 600, 900 and 1200 ppm. In addition, a significant inhibition of alpha-amylase activity was also registered. Its activity achieved 131.68 ± 1.7 µg of starch consumed/larva at 1200 ppm. Results also showed that ingestion of Makisterone A decreased the esterase and P-450 monooxygenases activities when used at higher concentration. In contrast, glutathione S-transferase activity increased in a dose dependent manner. The activity reached 273.26 ± 6.4 nanomoles of substrate conjugated/min/mg of protein using Makisterone A at 1200 ppm. All the results showed the bioinsecticidal potential of phytoecdysteroids in control of insect pests of stored products.",

This study was conducted to investigate insecticide resistance status in three Cx. pipiens populations. These populations were collected from two rural breeding sites and one urban site in Egypt. Al-Beshlawy drainage canal and El-Khartoum irrigation ditch were selected to represent rural sites in Giza and Beheira governorates, respectively. One man-made ground hole was selected in Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, as an urban breeding site. Insecticide residues were analysed in water samples collected from the three breeding sites. Four insecticides, malathion chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin and fipronil, were tested against Cx. pipiens third-instar larvae of three field populations and one insecticide-susceptible (reference) population. Four insecticide residues and one additive (piperonyl butoxide) were detected; only malathion and piperonyl butoxide concentrations exhibited significant differences among all breeding sites. The level of malathion residue in the Giza breeding site was significantly higher than those in the Gharbia and Beheira breeding sites. According to the lethal concentrations (LC50) of the applied insecticides, the susceptibility of Cx. pipiens third-instar larvae to different insecticides demonstrated the order fipronil > chlorpyrifos > deltamethrin > malathion. Variations in the percentage mortality of Cx. pipiens were observed following malathion application between the Gharbia population and with both Giza and Beheira populations. Culex pipiens populations exhibited low resistance to most tested insecticides; however, the populations of Giza and Beheira exhibited moderate resistance to malathion. The variation in the resistance of Cx. pipiens populations to malathion could provide new information about the intraspecific variation among some mosquito populations in Egypt.",

Both strains of T. granarium were exposed to phosphine gas at various concentrations and exposure times in a laboratory. Our results showed that the exposure time was the more important variable than the phosphine concentration against both T. granarium strains; in contrast, the concentration was comparatively more important against the resistant strain than the susceptible one.

In Mauritius, the major fruit fly species of economic and quarantine importance in agricultural production are Bactrocera zonata (Saunders), Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) and Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). In line with the government's policy for sustainable and organic agriculture under the challenge of climate change, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is being investigated as an alternative to chemical control. For successful cost-effective SIT programme island-wide, the production of competitive and sterile individuals for release is a key requirement. The aim of this study was to investigate the life cycle parameters of B. zonata to evaluate the feasibility of optimum mass rearing of this species. It was observed that B. zonata has a pre-oviposition period of 8 days, an oviposition duration of 51 days, the number of eggs per female along the complete oviposition period was 705 eggs and the peak egg hatchability varied from 88.5 to 91.5 %. The study showed that egg collection could be started as from day 13. The findings demonstrated that 5 weeks of egg collection is optimal for a rearing facility of B. zonata and production cages should be discarded on day 41. It was found that B. zonata has a net reproductive rate of 300.04 females and a mean generation time of 28.73 days. Given a positive Ro and a short T, it can be concluded that mass rearing of B. zonata is economically viable. Within a short period a laboratory population of this species for mass rearing can be established.",

Specifically, the fumigant action of the three local plant essential oils, namely Cinnamomum sp. (Lauraceae), Eucalyptus sp. (Myrtaceae), and Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), were tested against Acanthoscelides obtectus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), which has recently become a major pest of dry beans in Egypt. To test the efficacy of each oil, 7 μl was added to a piece of filter paper at various concentrations (4–11 %) and then placed inside a perforated gelatin capsule. This technique was used to eliminate direct contact between the volatile oils and stored beans (to avoid any adverse effects to beans). At 48 h post-treatment, adult insect mortality was significantly increased for all tested oils relative to the untreated control. Based on probit analysis at 48 h post-treatment, the Cinnamomum sp. essential oil was the most effective (LC50 = 4.55 %; 4.23–4.89 %). Eucalyptus sp. (LC50 = 7.47 %; 7.15–7.80 %) and S. officinalis (LC50 = 7.57 %; 7.20–7.96 %) had similar but lower efficacies. The main component in Cinnamomum sp. oil was (E)-cinnamaldehyde (a phenylpropene), while in Eucalyptus sp. oil it was 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), and in S. officinalis oil they were eucalyptol and camphor (terpenoids). The fumigant activity of the tested oils is attributable to their richness in volatile phenylpropene and terpenoids. The gelatin capsule is a simple yet effective technique that could be used in integrated pest management programmes for postharvest treatments, but further testing is required, especially in small-to-medium storage environments.",

(Myrtaceae), the weed remains a significant problem in areas within the Western Cape Province and parts of the Eastern Cape Province. Being predominantly invasive within coastal dune fynbos, the species is notoriously difficult to manage. Whilst the past 10-year period has seen limited focus and funding for this specific project, this review addresses possible reasons for the lack of success of the biocontrol programme over the past three decades, which has relied on two agents, a leaf-mining moth, Aristea thalassias (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) and a flower-galling midge, Dasineura strobila (Dorchin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Although both agents are widespread and occur across the range of L. laevigatum, the plant continues to grow aggressively despite their presence. Findings to date suggest that mortality resulting from parasitism or predation of the agents' immature stages is not the underlying problem for the limited control of the plant and that other factors must be at play. However, further investigation to better understand the dynamics of the insect populations and ecology of this weed, is needed to help to clarify the questions that, to date, remain unanswered. Other potential agents are also currently under consideration, notably a scale insect, Callococcus leptospermi (Maskell) (Homoptera: Coccoidea). In its native range (Australia) C. leptospermi, has a patchy distribution and variable levels of abundance, reasons for which are still under investigation. With no foreseeable biocontrol breakthrough in the near future, an integrated approach to managing L. laevigatum is probably the only short to medium-term solution for this species.",

Permission to release two leaf-feeding beetles, Zygogramma signatipennis Stål and Zygogramma piceicollis Stål (Chrysomelidae) against T. rotundifolia was granted in 2014, while permission to release a defoliating tortoise beetle, Physonota maculiventris Stål, against T. diversifolia was granted in 2018. The two Zygogramma spp. were released in Gauteng (GP), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Limpopo (LP), and MP provinces from 2014 to 2019. Zygogramma signatipennis established at only a few sites in MP, where it persisted for up to four years and later collapsed. Zygogramma piceicollis initially established in GP and perished a year later. Physonota maculiventris was released in KZN, LP and MP, and has overwintered at 50% of the release sites. Investigations to explain the demise of both Zygogramma spp. and determine ways to improve their release and establishment are underway. Host-specificity testing of a stem-boring weevil, Lixus fimbriolatus Boheman (Curculionidae), a candidate agent for T. rotundifolia, was successfully completed. An application for permission to release the weevil will be submitted to the regulatory authorities in due course. Additional host-specificity testing of agents for T. diversifolia has prioritised a leaf-mining moth, Melanocinclis sp.

Investigations to determine the full identity, origin and host range of a leaf-sucking lace bug (Hemiptera: Tingidae), discovered on T. diversifolia in KZN, LP and MP, are underway. Surveys in climate-matched regions of the Central American native range of the target Tithonia spp. are imperative to identify natural enemies that may be more adaptable to persist across the plants' distribution in South Africa.",

While general trends in shape are noted, variation is overlapping, both between individuals of the same species and within pairs of spermathecae from the same specimen. It is concluded, therefore, that spermathecal form is not a useful character to distinguish females of the three species, and that the use of spermathecae as diagnostic characters in the genus Curtonotum Macquart, in general, must be viewed critically and with a high degree of scepticism.",

The relationship between food consumption and the activity of five isoenzymes in the motor muscles of desert locust was investigated. Nutritional indices were estimated in fifth instar female nymphs. Consumption and assimilation rates on L. corniculatus were significantly lower than those on wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum) as control plant. The efficiency of ingested (ECI) and digested (ECD) food conversion was significantly lower in the nymphs fed on L. corniculatus than for those fed on wheat seedlings. The relative growth rate (RGR) and relative consumption rate (RCR) for nymphs feeding on L. corniculatus were significantly lower. The development duration of nymphs fed on Lotus was relatively longer than that for those fed on wheat seedlings. Nymphs fed on L. corniculatus lost weight. Electrophoretic assays of five enzymes were assessed in adult females to examine the feeding effect on L. corniculatus and T. aestivum on the isoenzymatic patterns of these enzymes. Considered enzymes were acid phosphatase (Acph), alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), β-esterase (β-Est), malic enzyme (Mal) and malate dehydrogenase (Mdh). Enzymes were tested in femur and wing muscles of adult females. Feeding on T. aestivum seemed to be more efficient for the activity of the metabolic enzymes (Acph, Mal and Mdh) than feeding on L. corniculatus. Their isoenzymes were relatively more expressed in the case of feeding on T. aestivum. The activity of esterase isoenzymes (β-Est) was higher in the case of feeding on L. corniculatus thus indicating the role of this particular enzyme in detoxifying plant linamarin allelochemicals.",

    "abstract": "Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) is one of the most problematic plant invaders in South Africa and has been targeted for biological control for over 50 years. Essential oil constituents which often change in response to insect herbivory are reported to play a crucial role in plant—insect interactions. However, nothing is known about the chemical profiles of essential oils of L. camara varieties in South Africa and how this changes under herbivory. Therefore, essential oils were collected using hydrodistillation from undamaged and insect-damaged leaves of four L. camara varieties and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to elucidate their chemical profiles. A total of 163 compounds were identified from the undamaged leaves of the various L. camara varieties. Feeding by the biocontrol agent Falconia intermedia Distant (Hemiptera: Miridae) resulted in changes in the quality and quantity of chemical constituents of the essential oils. Only 75 compounds were identified from the insect-damaged leaves of L. camara varieties.Terpenes were the major components across the varieties, while caryophyllene, hexane, naphthalene, copaene and α-caryophyllene were commonin all the varieties tested from both undamaged and insect-damaged leaves. Results from this study indicated the chemical distinctiveness of the Whitney Farm variety from other varieties. The changes in chemical concentrations indicated that feeding by the mirid on L. camara varieties causes an induction by either reducing or increasing the chemical concentrations. These inductions following the feeding by F. intermedia could be having a negative impact on the success of biological control against L. camara varieties. However, the focus of this paper is to report on the chemical baseline of L. camara varieties. Hence, comparisons of chemical compound concentrations of L. camara essential oils tested and the feeding-induced changes with respect to their quality and quantity are discussed.",

Mn-SaSOD of S. argyrostoma has a single open reading frame (orf ) of 765 nucleotides that encode a polypeptide of 254 amino acids. Subsequent analyses of Mn-SOD gene sequences revealed that the identified Mn-SaSOD gene in this study shared homology with similar genes from other insect species. In addition, four manganese ion-binding sites (metalbinding sites) and Mn-Fe SOD signature were identified within the orf of Mn-SaSOD. One putative transcription factor-binding site (TATT) within the 5′-flanking region was predicted.

Important to this objective is the ability to accurately distinguish foreign from closely related domestic species, a process that has traditionally required identification using diagnostic morphological keys that can be both subtle and labour-intensive. This is the case for the mealybugs that include several important agricultural pests with cryptic morphological characters.ADNAbarcoding methodology was used to identify a destructive mealybug species recently reported from cotton and vegetables in different regions of Swaziland. A fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was sequenced for specimens of mealybug collected from wild and cultivated host plants in Highveld, Lowveld and Lubombo regions. The sequences obtained were aligned and comparisons were made within the group and with GenBank sequences of morphologically identified species collected from Turkey, Japan and Israel. Mealybug specimens from five crops and seven wild host plants belonging to six families in the Highveld, Lowveld and Lubambo regions of Swaziland were identified to be the cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). This is the first record of the invasive mealybug in southern Africa. The study has validated the efficacy of sequence diversity in the COI gene for identifying mealybugs. The risks this pest poses to crop production in Swaziland and neighbouring countries are discussed.",

Sixth instar nymphs were supplied with a mixed diet of Manihot esculenta, Vernonia amygdalina and Chromolaena odorata, and a single sample of each of these and Acalypha wilkesiana. The highest growth rate, the most haemolymph and fat body, and the greatest food value in these tissues (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids), were generally found in those grasshoppers fed on the mixed diet and those fed on M. esculenta. Grasshoppers fed on A. wilkesiana and V. amygdalina mostly yielded intermediate, and those on C. odorata the lowest values. Instar duration lasted twice as long on C. odarata. Mixtures of Synedrella nodiflora, C. odorata and Paullinia pinnata, and each of these plus M. esculenta and A. witkesiana, were tested singly on the adults. The best somatic growth was manifest by adult females fed on M. esculenta and A. wilkesiana, and the poorest on C. odorata. On S. nodiflora and the mixture, growth was intermediate. The pre-oviposition period was shortest on M. esculenta and longest on S. nodiflora. The ovaries did not develop on C. odorata and P. pinnata. In late vitellogenesis, the largest ovarioles, containing the most reserves, were found in adult females fed on M. esculenta, and the smallest on S. nodiflora. On A. wilkesiana and the mixture, these were intermediate. Most eggs were produced on M. esculenta, but egg-pod length was constant irrespective of food plant. It was concluded that a mixed diet, even of relatively poor plants, is generally more beneficial than single food plants.",

    "abstract": "Katacamilla Papp, 1978, hitherto a monotypic genus of Camillidae known only from Namibia, is revised to include five species from Africa and the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The revision is based on more than 400 specimens. The placement of Katacamilla in the Camillidae is confirmed. A revised diagnosis of the genus is given. Katacamilla is distinguished from all other camillid genera by at least 10 character states, six of which are autapomorphies. A key to the species is presented. illustrations of head profiles, male forefemur and terminalia are provided for all species. Katacamilla cavernicola Papp is redescriptionbed from three Namibian localities. Four new species are descriptionbed: K. braacki from northeastern South Africa, K. ctenidia from northern Nigeria, K. gallagheri from eastern Oman and K. procavia from central Namibia. Katacamilla cavernicola is known only from caves, where it exhibits both parietal and troglophilic habitat preferences; it has been reared from dung of the rock pigeon, Columba guinea Linnaeus (parietal), and of the common slit-faced bat, Nycteris thebaica Geoffroy (troglophilic). Katacamilla braacki has been collected in close association with dung of the Egyptian fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus (Geoffroy), in a troglophilic habitat. Katacamilla procavia has been reared from the dung of the rock hyrax, Procavia capensis (Pallas), taken from the shelter of a rocky overhang. Katacamilla ctenidia and K. gallagheri are probably associated with the dung of birds and/or small mammals in relatively exposed habitats. A preliminary cladistic analysis suggests that the clade comprising the bat-associated (cavernicolous) sister species, K. cavernicola and K. braacki, is the most highly derived in the genus and, consequently, that association with bats is a recent specialization.",

Isolation of the active compound using reversed-phase liquid chromatography revealed that it is apparently identical in all the antlion species investigated. The primary structure, identified by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing using Edman chemistry and electrospray mass spectrometry, identified the compound as an octapeptide (pGlu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Thr-GlyTrp-NH2), which is a typical member of the large adipokinetic hormone/red pigmentconcentrating hormone family. Such a peptide, denoted Grb-AKH, had previously been identified in certain orthopteran insects. It is suggested that the peptide provides metabolite mobilization during flight in adult antlions.",

Either a hand or mechanical auger may be used. Distance from the trunks of apple trees, and the amount and nature of root material in the samples, affected the number of aphids recorded. More aphids were recorded in soil samples containing root material, particularly if the roots had galls resulting from the feeding of E. lanigerum, than in samples in which there were no roots. The number of E. lanigerum in samples decreased as the distance from the trunk at which they were taken increased. The distance from the trunk at which samples were taken was standardized to 30 cm. The system will be suitable for detecting changes in subterranean population levels over time and for comparing soil treatments for woolly apple aphid control, but not for decision making regarding the necessity for control actions.",

(Lepidoptera : Pyralidae) were investigated in the laboratory under an ambient temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and 60 ± 20 % relative humidity. The effect of morphological and anatomical characteristics of the pods on their nutritional status was also assessed. Larval mass gain on pods of cowpea cultivars, IT84S 2246 and TVu 13731, was significantly higher than on pods of wild cowpea, TVnu 863, cowpea cultivar, IT91K 180, V. oblongifolia, TVnu 42 and V. vexillata, TVnu 72. The relative consumption rate (RCR) and relative growth rate (RGR) were significantly lower on TVnu 72 pods compared with other plants. Approximate digestibility (AD) was significantly higher on pods of IT91K 180, TVnu 42 and TVnu 863 compared with other plants. There was no difference between plants for efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD). Strong, significant positive correlations were found between mass gain and ECD (r = 0.90), RCR and RGR (r = 0.89), as well as RGR and ECI (r = 0.84). The density of glandular trichomes on pods of TVnu 72 was significantly higher than on pods of IT84S-2246 and TVnu 863. The density of nonglandular trichomes was similar among plants, but these trichomes were significantly longer on pods of TVnu 72 than on other Vigna species. There were strong, significant negative correlations between the length of the nonglandular trichomes and RCR,RGR and ECI. Of the 3-4 different layers of cells found in the pod wall of the Vigna species, thickness of the fourth (innermost) layer (endocarp) was significantly negatively correlated with RGR and ECI. Similarly, the thickness of the entire pod wall was significantly, negatively correlated with larval mass gain. Our findings suggest that long, non-glandular trichomes and thick pod walls reduce consumption and use of pods of Vigna species by M. vitrata.",

Palpares annulatus and E intermedia have several anatomical features that are characteristic of Myrmeleontidae and enable antlion larvae to exploit periods of food abundance and to survive long periods of food shortage. When food is ingested, the intima of the crop and rectal pouch, and the regulatory effect of the proventriculus prevent the disruption of the osmotic balance in these larvae. Food is retained in the midgut, as the midgut is discontinuous with the hindgut. Six of the eight Malpighian tubules are cryptonephric and end in a pear-shaped organ that is laterally displaced on the rectal pouch. The cryptonephric system, Malpighian tubules and the modified cuboidal epithelium of the rectal fold regulate the water balance of these larvae.",

Close relatives are still alive in southern Africa, like those belonging to the Mantophasma genus, probably one of the most intriguing living fossils in the world. Some nymphs were collected in a Namibian plateau east of the Erongo Complex and carefully cultivated in a laboratory. Our main purpose was to investigate the entire life cycle of these Namibian living fossils to share novel insights in the palaeoclimate of Baltic Eocene. We unravelled the adult morphology and the postembryonic development of these intriguing insects, commonly called heelwalkers, and performed a comparison of the morphometric, ecological and ethological data between our specimens and the living species described so far in literature. Furthermore, we analysed the vibrational male–female communication of these primitive insects. The robust evidence provided here supports some controversial recent palynological assessments of the Eocene and show that the Baltic landscape was much more open than commonly thought.",

Through simultaneous mechanical and chemical activity, the larvae largely cause physical damage to the wool and meat. Over the past few decades, myiasis has predominantly been controlled with the use of various synthetic chemicals, in addition to various sheep husbandry practices. However, an increased development of chemical resistance has been noted. With this, the aim of the study was to evaluate and compare various plant extracts for the potential use in the management of Lucilia spp. Through use of inverted funnel choice tests, the repellent action of the plant extracts was assessed. With a commercial citronella spray employed in the control, similarly high repellency was observed with treatments of Zanthoxylum sp. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. With a minimum of 80 % pesticidal action required for test solutions to be considered successful, both plant extracts implicated potential action against the flies. The phytochemical secondary metabolic properties of the plant extracts were analysed with thin layer chromatography (TLC). Qualitative TLC was employed to differentiate the organic compound profiles of each plant extract, while various spray reagents were utilised to identify specific properties of various chemical groups. Those possibly contributing to the repellent results obtained included triterpenoids, alkaloids, essential oils, coumarin drugs, saponin drugs and flavonoids. With positive management potential and a basic phytochemical evaluation, further investigation into the use of these plant extracts against Lucilia spp. is advised.",

The primary fruit crops planted in EGVV include various varieties and cultivars of pome fruit, stone fruit, citrus, wine grapes and berries. Fruit fly trapping data from four consecutive seasons were sourced from a centralised database managed by a non-profit company, which operates an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme, incorporating the sterile insect technique (SIT) for C. capitata fruits flies, within EGVV. Mean trap catch between regions and seasons was compared. The spatio-temporal variation of mean trap catch was also investigated. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to symbolise and map mean trap catch per trap location. There was no significant difference in the mean trap catch between regions. Significant differences did occur between some seasons in Villiersdorp and Vyeboom but not in Elgin/Grabouw. The spatial distribution of trap catches between seasons varied greatly, indicating no definitive pattern. However, traps with the highest seasonal trap catch occurred mostly in the southeastern parts of each region and traps with lower levels were distributed mostly in the northwestern parts of each region. The results suggest a relationship between the geographic characteristics of EGVV and the abundance and distribution of C. capitata. It is recommended that an in-depth spatio-temporal analysis be carried out to better understand the geographical distribution of trap catches in the study area.",

Laboratory bioassays were conducted against three doses of plants extracts (0.2 mg/ml, 0.4 mg/ml and 0.6 mg/ml) and spider venom (10 µg/ml, 20 µg/ml and 30 µg/ml).

Calatropis procera inhibited acetylcholinesterase more proficiently as compared to the M. arvensis and E. globulus extracts. Crude spider venom also significantly inhibited the estimated activity of acetylcholinesterase in M. domestica and Ae. aegypti.

    "abstract": "Field evaluation of an auto-rotate gun sprayer and comparison with a knapsack sprayer was carried out to control whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) in the cotton crop. Two experiments were conducted at six locations of farmers' fields in southwestern (cotton-growing region) of Punjab state. The number of adult whiteflies was counted before and 3, 7 and 10 days after spray. Water-sensitive papers were attached at upper and under side of the leaves at three different points (top, middle and bottom) of plant canopy to find sprayers performance parameters, viz. droplet diameter, droplet density, per cent area covered and volume of spray deposition. Droplet density, area covered and volume of spray deposition were found significantly higher in case of the auto-rotate gun sprayer as compared to that of a knapsack sprayer. However, the volume median diameter of droplets was found significantly lesser in case of an auto-rotate gun sprayer, i.e. 286.95 µm as compared to the knapsack sprayer, i.e. 347.85 µm. The per cent whitefly control in the cotton crop in first experiment was found as 68.06 % and 65.90 % for auto-rotate gun and knapsack sprayer, respectively, by using pyriproxyfen 100 g active ingredient (g a.i.)/ha. Although in the second experiment the per cent whitefly control for auto-rotate gun sprayer was significantly higher, i.e. 83.27 % as compared to knapsack sprayer having 70.87 % control by using flonicamid 75 g a.i./ha. However, the bio-efficacy of auto-rotate gun sprayer was found higher for the both experiments as compared to the knapsack sprayer. The cost of operation of the auto-rotate gun sprayer was found to be US$4.11/ha as compared to knapsack sprayer with $6.85/ha. The cost, labour and time-saving in the spraying with the auto-rotate gun sprayer as compared to the knapsack sprayer was found to be 39.98, 93.44 and 96.64 %, respectively.",

Pre-selection (21 isolates) of the most virulent strain was based on >95 % mortality of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae and >90 % conidial germination. In comparison with the chemical standard, Aphox® WG (pirimicarb), which induced 100 % aphid mortality within 24 h, both B. bassiana strains were confirmed pathogenic to D. noxia over seven days post-inoculation. The B. bassiana strain PPRI 7598 caused a significantly higher cumulative mortality of 55.64 ± 2.32 % at 1 × 108 conidia/ml than the 43.1 ± 2.89 % recorded with PPRI 7861. Additionally, a significantly higher level of overt mycosis was recorded with PPRI 7598 (61.63 ± 1.66 %) in comparison with PPRI 7861 (52.06 ± 2.81 %), both at higher concentrations. The interaction between time (days) and treatment was significant, with an increase in aphid mortality over time. The results suggest that the two tested strains were significantly more pathogenic to aphids at the higher concentration (1 × 108 conidia/ml). In addition, these findings also direct our future research focus on exploration of PPRI 7598 against other cereal aphids, including oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, and as endophyte for induced systemic resistance to insects and diseases.",

The food consumption index, relative growth rate and approximate digestibility of the treated larvae were significantly decreased. In contrast, the efficiency of conversion of both ingested and digested food to body mass was significantly increased. The midgut ultrastructural variations included vacuolisation of the columnar cells, clumping of the nuclear chromatin, disorder of microvilli, loss of cytoplasmic projections of the goblet cells, disorganisation of mitochondria and appearance of residual bodies. It seems likely that mitochondria are the target site of garlic and lemon essential oils. The overall results suggest that the essential oils of garlic and lemon under investigation interfere with the nutritional physiology and ultrastructure of the midgut of S. littoralis larvae and have potential for their control. Future studies will be undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of garlic and lemon oils under field conditions.",

Psyllaephagus bliteus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was first released as a biological control agent against this pest in California in 2000. Since then, P. bliteus has been found with its insect pest host, with no intentional introduction, in various South American, European and North African countries, and recently South Africa. Here we report on host specificity studies of P. bliteus in South Africa in order to determine potential risks to non-target hosts. Non-target test insects included the only native lerp-forming psyllid in South Africa, Retroacizzia mopani (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), as well as two free-living and one lerp-forming psyllid that are not native but also feed on Eucalyptus species. Psyllaephagus bliteus was monitored during no-choice tests for antennation, probing and oviposition behaviours towards the test insects. In addition, P. bliteus was enclosed on live plants infested with the test insects which were then monitored for offspring of P. bliteus. Retroacizzia mopani and the non-native free-living psyllids were not attacked, but P. bliteus did attack and develop on the non-native lerp psyllid, Spondyliaspis cf. plicatuloides (Hemiptera: Aphalaridae). Choice tests were then undertaken with G. brimblecombei and S. cf. plicatuloides, and G. brimblecombei was found to be the preferred host. The results indicate that the risk of P. bliteus to native insects is low, but that the host range of P. bliteus is not restricted to Glycaspis spp. and Creiis costatus (Hemiptera: Aphalaridae) as previously thought. The host range of P. bliteus may thus include other lerp-forming insects on eucalypts, especially those within the Spondyliaspidinae.",

Being neither a spider nor a scorpion, we suggest ‘solifuge’, derived from the scientific name of the order, as the most neutral English vernacular name for these arachnids. Southern Africa is rich in solifuge diversity, which is also reflected in the rich and imaginative local vernacular names of this group. These names allude to myths associated with solifuges, to their characteristic behaviours, or to their unique and striking morphology. Here we briefly translate and discuss 40 vernacular terms used for solifuges in 25 languages and dialects in southern Africa (Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe), plus seven names in five languages in East Africa. Recognising solifuges as a distinct group, referred to by its own set of vernacular names, seem to be more common in rural, compared to urban areas. The conservation of indigenous names of animals might be inextricably linked to the conservation of these animals.",

The results revealed 11 mite species belonging to five families (Pyroglyphidae, Chortoglyphidae, Glycyphagidae, Acaridae, and Cheyletidae). Of the total collected number of mites (5276) the most dominant species were the dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae (66.1 %), followed by D. pteronyssinus (23.3 %), while the rest of the species, Chortoglyphus arcuatus, Lepidoglyphus destructor, Glycyphagus domesticus, Gohieria fusca, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, Caloglyphus sp, Cheyletus malaccensis, Blomia sp. and Acarus siro ranged between 0.16 and 2.0 %. Regarding the effect of temperature on mite populations, temperature more than 25 °C in summer decreased the numbers of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus. Toxicological tests of three essential plant oils against adult stages of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus showed that lemon grass oil was more effective than geranium and thyme oils, with a mortality of approximately 100 % at 800 ppm concentration for both species. The LC50 of lemon grass was 228.992 ppm and 293.615 ppm against the two species, respectively. From these results it is recommended that application of control measures during summer when the mite population density is at its lowest and to use botanical oil extracts which can be effectively implemented in integrated pest management programmes.",

Protein expression and viral replication in insect were determined using SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis. Results of lethal concentrations indicate that AaIT was the most efficient virus compared with AcMsJHE or AcMNPV. Median lethal concentration of AaIT was 4.0 × 105 PIBs/ml compared with 7.0 × 105 and 7.6 × 105 PIBs/ml for AcMsJHE and AcMNPV, respectively. AaIT killed the treated first instar larvae of A. ipsilon markedly faster than AcMsJHE or AcMNPV, and significantly affected third instar larval weight after 96 hours post-infection (h.p.i.), which the LT50s of AaIT were 94 and 89 h.p.i. when 1 × 106 and 1 × 108 PIBs/ml were used, respectively. SDS-PAGE for protein separation and agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA fragment visualization after restriction enzymes cut indicate that recombinant viruses might be replicated and expressed the inserted genes in A. ipsilon larvae. Protein profile showed differences among larval homogenate samples infected with recombinant viruses and wild type virus compared with control. DNA fragments of recombinant viruses run on 1% agarose gel indicate that there are different size and absence fragments when the total genome cut with EcoRI or PstI.

From the results obtained after applying different diversity indices (richness, dominance, evenness) and accumulation functions, we can infer that the Rhopalocera of the Gran Caldera de Lubá constitute an extraordinarily diverse community of great evenness, lacking generally highly threatened taxa or species with a localized occurrence on Bioko and, collectively, the fauna is characterized by a highly even and stable structure. The results obtained can provide the tools to develop conservation measures in the future, as well as to strengthen the creation of Scientific Reserves used as genetic resources warehouse.",

Implantation of corpora allata (CA) taken from gregarious sexually mature females caused crowded females to deposit smaller eggs and smaller, lighter hatchlings. The neuropeptide [His7]-corazonin, present in the central nervous system and corpus cardiacum, is known to induce darkening of body colouration when injected into locusts reared in isolation. To examine whether this neuropeptide is responsible for the maternal regulation of progeny phase characteristics, 1 nmol [His7]-corazonin mixed with 2 µl of sunflower oil were injected twice into solitarious female adults. No effect of corazonin on egg size, the weight of the hatchlings and brightness of their cuticular colour changes was found.",

In 2009 a F. humilis population was discovered by mining personnel after a coal mining licence had already been granted. As mining activities were swiftly impinging the population, nature conservation agencies proposed that the population be shifted to a safe habitat. The translocation was required to safeguard the population from certain extinction due to mining activities(Burgoyne & Hoffman 2011). Translocation, or assisted colonisation, whereby populations of a species under threat are intentionally relocated to another suitable habitat, is generally regarded as a 'last resort' conservation measure (Gordon 1994; Godefroid et al. 2011) and was applied as such in the case of F. humilis.",

Drosophila melanogaster-bacterial pathogen system was used to unravel how fitnessdivergent isofemale (homogeneous) lines and experimental population (heterogeneous) react to infection under standard and restricted diets. Life-history traits and fecundity of D. melanogaster were assessed under healthy and disease conditions. Marked differences were observed between half of the Drosophila lines and the heterogeneous population. Diet change failed to induce significant differences of survival percentage and development time in all lines, indicating lack of phenotypic plasticity under healthy conditions. However, following bacterial infection, the significant differences among the Drosophila life-history traits due to lines and bacterial strains demonstrated phenotypic plasticity and genotypeby- environment interaction on standard diet. By combining the two environmental factors (diet regime and treatment) together with the lines, D. melanogaster showed significant difference of the survival percentage due to Pectobacterium carotovorum infection. Interestingly, Drosophila fecundity was affected by genotype, diet and treatment. The fecundity showed a general reduction following infection or diet restriction exposure. The results of reaction norms of Drosophila survival percentage, development time and fecundity demonstrated that the isofemale lines were more plastic than the heterogeneous population under the range of environments tested. The obtained results give evidence that the fitness plasticity is considered an important mechanism to help the homogeneous populations to survive the harsh environmental circumstances, whereas the phenotypic variation of the heterogeneous populations is considered the major one.",

Wahlberg during his visit to southern Africa (1838-1845). It remained unnoticed for many years until Keetch (1973) recorded it as a pest of arabica coffee (Coffee arabica) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and called it the grey coffee snout beetle. The adult beetles were found to feed on the peduncle (stalk) of young coffee fruit which abort as a result, causing yield losses of up to 40%. The beetles also eat the soft succulent suckers, which snap. They eat cavities into green berries and into the stalk of more mature fruit, causing the fruit to fall, and damage flowers and leaves. They mainly attack young and newly planted coffee, but can also damage mature trees (Keetch et al. 1974;Annecke & Moran 1982). Keetch (1973) found it onvarious other plants such as Bidens pilosa (blackjack), water grass (Cyperus sp.), Grevillea robusta (silky oak) and sugarcane; he mentions that it is apparently of no economic significance on sugarcane. Schoeman (2001), however, called it the sugar cane snout beetle and mentioned that he had observed it feeding on the epidermis of banana in the Eshowe region, KZN, where it led to severe downgrading of the fruit. Schoeman (2009, 2015) recorded it as a pest of macadamia. In 2007 and 2008 he observed substantial damage on recently planted macadamia trees in the Stanger (now KwaDukuza) region of KZN and large infestations on mature trees in the Empangeni area of the same province. He also observed it in 2008 on macadamia in the Chipinge area of eastern Zimbabwe. It is also listed as a defoliator pest during the establishment of wattle and eucalypt seedlings (Govender 2002, 2007) and as a pest of tea (Annecke & Moran 1982).",

The aim of the current study was to test for the persistence of M. brunneum and M. pinghaense on apple bark over a period of three weeks, under laboratory conditions. Apple bark was sprayed with conidial suspensions of both fungi, at a standard infective conidial concentration of 107 conidia/ml. The persistence, or survival, of the conidia on apple bark was measured using codling moth larvae (CM) (Cydia pomonella) and females of woolly apple aphid (WAA) (Eriosoma lanigerum) as indicator species. The results showed that conidia of M. pinghaense can induce mortality of insect pests through contact with an EPF-treated substrate, with mortality of 39% to 82% for WAA over a period of 10 days post application, and with mortality of 3% to 68% for CM over a period of 7 days, after application to apple bark. Further evaluation showed that the conidia of M. pinghaense persisted longer on apple bark, up to 63%, than did M. brunneum, up to 11%, three weeks post application of the conidial suspensions. The study provides insights into the potential persistence of fungal isolates on apple bark over time post application. Further evaluation of the persistence of the isolates on apple bark under both glasshouse and field conditions should be conducted.",

Information on the basic biology of this insect, which is important for the development of surveillance and management strategies, is lacking. To investigate the life cycle and general biology of S. plicatuloides, the psyllid was reared under controlled glasshouse conditions on potted red-flowering gum, Corymbia ficifolia. The egg incubation period, number of nymphal instars and their developmental time, adult fecundity, adult longevity and duration of the life cycle were determined. The major diagnostic features used to differentiate the five nymphal instars were the number of antennal segments, wing pad development and body length. Females reached reproductive maturity 2.3 ± 0.47 (mean ± SD) days after eclosion and laid 16.2 ± 3.9 (mean ± SD) eggs on average. Reproduction was sexual. The first nymphal instar took 10.7 ± 1.2 (mean ± SD) days to hatch from the egg. The nymphal instars completed their development in 22.6 ± 1.4 (mean ± SD) days under the brown scalloped shelters they secrete. The insect's total life cycle lasted 37.37 ± 1.17 (mean ± SD) days from egg to adult death. Males and females lifespan is also reported. The study provides the first information on the basic biology of S. cf. plicatuloides that will be useful for future studies on surveillance and management strategies.",

The objectives were to develop a cost-effective protocol for formulation of infective propagules and to test their effectiveness under laboratory conditions. The conidia of both isolates were formulated using four different oils (liquid paraffin, coconut, canola and olive oils) as liquid carriers, and diatomaceous earth as a mineral carrier. Conidial viability and pathogenicity were assessed over a period of eight weeks. In the study, it was observed that the conidia formulated in oil carriers maintained a high conidial viability and survival rate of &gt;95 % over a period of eight weeks for both isolates, relative to when formulated in mineral carriers, or when stored as dry conidial powder. The conidia in all the oil formulations were also observed to induce high mortality, ranging between 60 % and 90 % for M. pinghaense, and between 70 % and 90 % for M. robertsii, when used against P. viburni. The ability of conidia of both isolates to maintain viability and pathogenicity, following storage in the oil formulations, increased the likelihood of the local isolates being successfully integrated as biological control agents for management of P. viburni under field conditions.",

Globally, it is regarded as one of the world’s worst invasive trees. In South Africa the tree has acquired a native seed-feeding wasp, Megastigmus transvaalensis (Hussey, 1956) (Hymenoptera: Torymidae). The wasp’s native hosts are from the Searsia F.A. Barkley genus (Anacardiaceae), but it has expanded its host range to form a new association with both S. terebinthifolia and its close relative Schinus molle L. (Anacardiaceae). In order to quantify the seed predation by M. transvaalensis on S. terebinthifolia seeds, tree populations were surveyed across the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The wasp was present at 99% of the S. terebinthifolia populations with an average of 22% of the seeds being destroyed. In the Eastern Cape province, the highest seed damage occurred at the start of the winter months, when about 35% of seeds were damaged. This fell to less than 12% in spring and summer when the plants were flowering. Megastigmus transvaalensis was found at nearly all the S. terebinthifolia populations in South Africa, but due to the limited number of predated seeds it is unlikely to reduce population sizes or curb the spread of the invasive alien tree in South Africa.",

Although it is known to be attracted to light and possess sexually dimorphic body colouration, the visual ecology of S. noctilio is poorly understood. Photoreceptor sensitivity of the compound eyes in S. noctilio is not sexually dimorphic. These previous results suggest that colour tracking of one sex by the other might not be an important input for mate searching. This study aimed to expand our knowledge of the visual system of S. noctilio by means of i) morphological description of the compound eyes and ocelli; and ii) semi-field behavioural tests of the colour preference of newly emerged wasps. Eye and ocellus morphological features were investigated in 21 males and 21 females. Measurement of male and female median ocellus diameter, compound eye surface area, number of ommatidia and facet diameter varied from 0.22 to 0.40 mm, 0.589 to 2.277 mm2, 1820 to 4207 and 1.88 × 10–2 to 2.82 × 10–2 mm, respectively. In addition, all traits significantly correlated with body size. Male and female wasps emerged from infested host material in a flight cage with five traps, each reflecting a different colour. Analysis of trap captures did not identify any colour preference, but an effect of trap location was observed with traps in the north-eastern position capturing more woodwasps, suggesting that other factors, e.g., global landmarks or other non-colour visual cues might guide initial flight behaviour of S. noctilio.",

Despite being the biggest in the country, mosquito diversity in this District is under-explored, more so in the malaria non-endemic sub-districts. Here, we thus sampled mosquito adults and larvae from the malaria endemic sub-district of Bobirwa and non-endemic sub-districts of Palapye and Serowe, to determine spatial mosquito abundance and diversity in the District. Overall, all the sub-districts had a representation of key mosquito taxa of medical and economic importance (Aedes, Culex and Anopheles), irrespective of malarial endemicity status. Bobirwa had the highest number of mosquitoes sampled (429) although the greatest species richness (0.8511) was observed from Palapye. Moreover, Palapye also recorded a species from another genus, Culiseta longiareolata, a known natural vector of avian malaria parasites. Given global climate shift projections for the region, there is a need for continuous area-wide surveillance for vector mosquitoes and associated parasites in curbing the risk of emerging and re-emerging infections. While the Anopheles-centric approach to mosquito control is still necessary, a holistic approach, incorporating other vector incriminated mosquito species is warranted, particularly given shifting climates and the presence of invasive disease associated vector mosquito species.",

    "abstract": "Expansion and intensification of agroecosystems is one of the major causes of habitat loss in the savanna biome in South Africa. As such, this study sought to determine the influence of commercial subtropical fruit plantations (banana and macadamia) on species richness, abundance, and composition of surface-active arthropods compared to the savanna biome. Given that pesticides and herbicides are applied from spring to early autumn in banana and macadamia plantations, we sampled in winter to reduce the potential impact of pesticides and herbicides. Surface-active arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps. Habitat type did not affect species richness and abundance of ants and spiders, as well as species richness of beetles. However, significantly greater abundance of beetles was recorded in the macadamia plantation compared to the banana and savanna. This could have been due to greater abundance of herbivorous beetles and other insects, which would have increased the diversity of predatory beetles. Furthermore, unlike the banana plantation, the macadamia plantation was characterised by a deep leaf litter layer and the presence of weeds and grasses, which probably increased abundance of beetles. Species composition indicated that the studied arthropod taxa associate with specific habitats, as demonstrated by the three habitats supporting different species composition. Despite savanna habitat not supporting high species richness or abundance of surface-active arthropods, we recorded the highest number of unique species of ants and spiders in the savanna rather than in the plantations. These results highlight the importance of natural landscapes in conservation of surface-active arthropods.",

    "abstract": "Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823 and Anopheles arabiensis Patton, 1905 (Diptera: Culicidae) are often found breeding in the same water sources and engage in interspecific competition. Although Cx. quinquefasciatus is known to proliferate in a range of polluted environments, the ability of An. arabiensis to proliferate in polluted water has only been reported relatively recently. The effects of pollution and insecticide resistance on this competitive interaction are unknown. This study examined the effect of pollution on the dynamics of the interspecific competition. Three laboratory strains were used in this study: an insecticide susceptible and an insecticide resistant An. arabiensis, and an insecticide resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus. Larval pollutant tolerances of each strain were assessed and compared by determining the lethal concentration at 50% mortality (LC50). The larvae from each strain were exposed to either inorganic fertiliser or copper nitrate, following which eclosion success was assessed. The results showed that the insecticide resistant strains had higher emergence rates when reared in polluted conditions without competition, with the Cx. quinquefasciatus strain showing the highest rate of eclosion. This species also had a higher tolerance for metal pollution than the An. arabiensis strains. The effects of pollutants on oviposition choice were examined. Pollution altered adult oviposition choice. The effect of larval metal exposure had variable effects on the activity of metabolic detoxification enzymes. An insecticide resistant phenotype had greater tolerance to pollutants and possibly developmental advantages based on a variable detoxification response to the pollutant. Pollution can therefore alter interspecific competition dynamics between the malaria vector An. arabiensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus.",

    "abstract": "The southern and eastern parts of the African Fynbos region favour the production of honeybush tea. Honeybush biomass and extracts are used to prepare a beverage both locally and internationally, mainly as herbal tea with health benefits. Honeybush tea is mostly grown organically requiring natural control measures for pests and diseases. The leafhopper, Molopopterus sp., is one of the most important pests of cultivated honeybush in South Africa, as its feeding compromises the quality and quantity of the yield through leaf discolouration and reduction of the photosynthetic area. Local entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) can provide a pool of potential biocontrol agents for this pest. Therefore, a total of 98 soil samples were collected from organically grown honeybush fields and vegetation surrounding the honeybush fields in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Entomopathogenic fungi were isolated using the insect bait method and were characterised using molecular techniques. Twenty fungal isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and Fusarium oxysporum were recovered from soil samples, of which 70% were from honeybush fields and 30% were from surrounding vegetation. Fusarium oxysporum isolates comprised 20% of the recovered isolates; M. anisopliae the remainder. Laboratory bioassays of the recovered isolates against adults and nymphs of the leafhopper, showed that F. oxysporum isolates caused 10–45% mortality and M. anisopliae isolates 30–80% mortality. Metarhizium anisopliae isolates J S1, KF S3, KF S11, KF S13, LS1 and LS2 were the most virulent and induced over 60% mortality in both nymphs and adults at a concentration of 1 × 107 conidia/ml.",

The aphid has developed some level of resistance against several chemical insecticides. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) have been identified as promising biological control agents against a wide array of insect pests. The main aim of this study was to conduct a survey in local apple orchards in the Western Cape province for EPF and to use isolates to test the susceptibility of WAA under optimum laboratory conditions. Soil samples were collected from apple orchards and EPF, baited and isolated using larvae of Galleria mellonella and Tenebrio molitor. Six EPF species: Beauveria bassiana, Cordyceps fumosorosea, Metarhizium brunneum, M. pinghaense, M. robertsii and Purpureocillium lilacinum were identified from the soil samples. The results from bioassays showed that Metarhizium robertsii and M. pinghaense isolates were the most effective with an average percentage mortality of &gt; 90%. Metarhizium brunneum also proved to be effective when used against the insect with an average percentage mortality of &gt; 80%, while B. bassiana and C. fumosorosea were the least effective with average percentage mortality of 52% and 48%, respectively. The LT50 and LT90 of M. robertsii (2.12; 4.19) and M. pinghaense (2.05; 4.45) showed to require similar mortality time in days of E. lanigerum. The results obtained in the study have provided an insight into the diversity of EPF species across apple orchards of the Western Cape and shown the efficacy of the Metarhizium isolates as potential biological control agents of the WAA.",

The tree has been introduced worldwide and has become invasive in South Africa. In 2017, it was listed as one of the nine fastest-spreading weeds in South Africa. Once established, it competes with and displaces indigenous species and dense stands can significantly reduce stream flow. The Asian seed-feeding bruchid, Megabruchidius tonkineus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was introduced into South Africa and has subsequently taken honey locust as a host plant. The beetle damages honey locust seeds and is therefore considered a biological control agent, despite no host-specificity or impact studies having been conducted. This study shows that M. tonkineus has established across the entire G. triacanthos population range in South Africa, damaging approximately 9% of seeds. Laboratory studies show that M. tonkineus completes its larval development in the seeds of G. triacanthos in about 66.80 ± 0.69 SE days before emerging.

Push-pull technology is an important component of this AW-IPM approach. The sugarcane push-pull programme uses plants which are both repellent (Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv. (Cyperales: Poaceae)) and attractive (Cyperus dives Delile and Cyperus papyrus L. (both Cyperales: Cyperaceae) to E. saccharina. Previous research demonstrated the efficacy of push-pull in the Midlands North region of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. To date, little research has been conducted in coastal sugarcane growing areas. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using push-pull for management of E. saccharina in coastal KZN, using large-scale on-farm field trials conducted on five model farms. On each farm, wetland habitats were rehabilitated with pull plants (C. dives and C. papyrus) and fields were intercropped with the repellent grass M. minutiflora. Eldana saccharina damage and infestation levels were recorded to assess the efficacy of push-pull, using a multiple before-after-control-impact (mBACI) design. Push-pull treatment sites showed a significant reduction in mean percentage stalk damage and E. saccharina abundance relative to control sites. Furthermore, stemborer surveys in wetland habitats revealed higher numbers of E. saccharina within Cyperus spp. stands. Pull plants were therefore effective at attracting E. saccharina away from sugarcane. The success of the push-pull trials in this study indicates that it is a useful tool for managing E. saccharina populations in coastal sugarcane, especially in conjunction with other management practices.",

    "abstract": "The phoretic or epizoitic association of blackfly (Diptera: Simuliidae) larvae and pupae with other aquatic arthropods has been documented for a number of tropical African species (Grenier & Mouchet 1959; Corbet 1961, 1962; Germain et al. 1966; Disney 1969, 1971a–d, 1973; also references in Crosskey 1990). The significance of these associations has led to much speculation, although no scientific conclusions regarding the origin and purposes of the associations have been reached (Corbet 1961; Crosskey 1990). Attachment of simuliid larvae and pupae to other aquatic arthropods could be fortuitous, especially where dense populations of simuliid larvae occur, and where they may encounter difficulties in locating suitable substrates on which to attach. There are, however, a number of blackfly species that have developed obligatory associations with specific arthropod hosts and these simuliids manifest a range of unique morphological adaptations. In the larvae, these include a modified abdominal cuticle, structurally modified or reduced cephalic feeding fans, the ventral position of the terminal abdominal proleg with its attachment hooks and, in the pupae, the development of additional abdominal hooks that secure them in their reduced ‘half slipper-shaped cocoon’ (Crosskey 1990). The distribution of obligate phoretic associations between blackflies and other arthropods is recorded as being restricted to central Asia and tropical Africa. In central Asia only mayflies of the family Heptageniidae (Ephemeroptera) are involved in the association, and the blackfly larvae and pupae do not manifest any striking morphological adaptations. In tropical Africa there are phoretic associations of blackflies with Decapoda (Potamonautidae and Atyidae) and Ephemeroptera (Heptageniidae, Oligoneuriidae and Baetidae). These obligatory phoretic blackfly larvae and pupae have many specialized morphological modifications. In Africa the most widespread records of phoretic associations are those between Simuliidae and Potamonautidae. These extend from Liberia and Kenya to Malawi (Crosskey 1990). The association between Simuliidae and Ephemeroptera range from Liberia and Uganda to Tanzania and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a recent record in northern Namibia (Palmer & de Moor 1998). Surveys conducted by staff of the Albany Museum in 1990 and 1991 recorded larvae and pupae of Simulium (Phoretomyia) lumbwanum de Meillon together with large numbers of nymphs of heptageniid mayflies belonging to Afronurus scotti Schoonbee and a Compsoneuria species. One mature nymph of Compsoneuria supported a penultimate instar larva of S. lumbwanum (Figs 1, 2). The specific identification of the Compsoneuria nymph could not be confirmed as several nymphs of known African species have not yet been de-",

Yellow sticky card traps were used to monitor adult numbers, while counts on the fruit were conducted to monitor numbers of adults and larvae. Fruit size was measured throughout the season. Hoerl's function (Y = aXbecX) was used to describe the relationship between the number of S. aurantii on the fruit and fruit size, as well as the number on the traps and fruit size. A notable feature in the population dynamics of S. aurantii was the rapid decline in numbers after the population peak had been reached. The highest numbers of S. aurantii were present between fruit set and when fruit reached 40 mm in length. Fruit size can therefore be used as an indicator of potentially damaging number. Producers should do regular monitoring from fruit set until fruit reach 40 mm.",

Using a two-stage sampling system for determining population levels, the optimum combination of the number of trees per orchard (primary units) and fruit per tree (secondary units), was estimated. Taylor's power law regression of log(S2) on 10g(X. . ) provided a good fit for both the within-tree (r-2 = 0.887) and between-tree (r-2 0.746) data. The value for the aggregation coefficient, b, in both cases was > 1, indicating a dumped distribution. Sampling precision, D, improved with increasing average numbers of S. aurantii pedruit. ln addition, keeping the total number of fruit examined constant, sampling precision at low population levels improved by increasing the number of trees sampled and decreasing the number of fruit examined per tree. Examining 50 fruit per orchard should be sufficient for obtaining suitably accurate population estimates for pest management purposes.",

    "abstract": "The mango scale Aulacaspis tubercularis (Newstead), which is of Asian origin, is a widespread pest throughout the mango-producing areas of South Africa, where it causes considerable losses to the export industry because of its cosmetic damage to fruit. Through an initiative of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) - Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Crops (ITSC), several attempts at introducing parasitoids for the biological control of this pest in South Africa were made during 1992-1995 (Labuschagne & De Beer 1995). This entailed a search for parasitoids in Taiwan, Pakistan, India, Singapore and Malaysia that yielded at least four unidentified species of the genus Aphytis. This is an important group of primary ecto-parasitoids of diaspidid scale insects. None of these species could, however, be reared successfully in quarantine. Subsequently, a consignment of parasitized mango scales imported from Thailand in 1995 yielded yet another unidentified species of Aphytis. This species was successfully propagated in quarantine, initially at ARC - Plant Protection Research Institute (PPRI), Pretoria and later at the facilities of ITSC in Nelspruit (Labuschagne et al. 1996).\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the identity of the species from Thailand, which was previously referred to in the literature as 'Aphytis sp.' and which has since become established in South Africa after it was released at various localities in the mango-growing areas of Mpumalanga and the Northern Province during 1996-1997 (Labuschagne et al. 1996; Daneel & Dreyer 1997). The species has subsequently been identified as A. chionaspis Ren, which was originally described from China as a parasitoid of the diaspidid Chionaspis cinnamomicola (Takahashi) (Ren 1988). A diagnosis and comments on its placement within the A. lingnanensis group of species are provided here to facilitate the recognition of this poorly known parasitoid, that was hitherto known only from its type material, which has been lost.",

Since Byrrhidium and Namakwanus are currently placed in the tribe Canthonini, the group traditionally considered to be the most ancient and basal of the ball-rolling dung beetles (Hanski & Cambefort 1991), the obvious placement of the new genus would be there too. However, the Canthonini are doubtfully monophyletic (Scholtz & Howden 1987). To compound the matter, many of the African canthonine genera are monotypic and probably represent relictual elements of otherwise extinct lineages.",

This was compared with total development duration for sets of individuals not disturbed in this way. As expected, development rate was slower at lower temperatures. At 16.03 °C there was no development beyond the first larval instar. The larval period was longer than other stages at all temperatures. A significant difference in total development rate of adults was observed between the two treatments (disturbed and undisturbed), except at 18.60 °C.

Combined GC-MS analysis of extract of head extracts showed it to contain a series of fatty acids and long-chain hydrocarbons. The relative abundances of compounds differed between individuals, suggesting that secretions from the head may partially serve as a nestmate recognition cue. Bees were also able to distinguish their nests from conspecific nests. Combined GC-MS of extracts taken from nest collars revealed nest-specific blends of compounds that would facilitate nest identification and discrimination.

Here we describe a very unusual form of larval morphology in an African allodapine bee, Compsomelissa zaxantha, and show that this corresponds with phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data indicating that this species is much more closely allied with the genus Allodapula, but represents an evolutionary clade that differs strongly from currently described subgenera of Allodapula.

Parameters used in this evaluation were damage and losses caused to grains that were attacked, and the suitability of the grains for insect breeding. Results showed that S. oryzae caused varying degrees of damage and weight loss to eight varieties of cowpeas, just as it did to sorghum and maize. Five varieties of cowpea (IT86D-719, IT86D-721, IT89KD-288, IT90K-277-2 and IT93K-452-1) were significantly (P < 0.01) resistant to S. oryzae than other varieties of cowpeas. SARC-L02 had significantly (P < 0.05) higher susceptibility index while IT90K-277-2 had the lowest susceptibility index of zero. In the absence of its preferred host crop, sorghum or rice, S. oryzae will most probably switch host to cowpea instead of maize, because it developed faster on most cowpeas, just like it does on sorghum than on maize. This unusual observation calls for urgent integrated action on grain handling and storage, as many are often stored together in markets or stores by grain dealers and farmers and this would increase the risk of easy spread of the weevil in such stores.",

The label data and preservation condition of each specimen are provided. The type of Dziedzickia nitida Edwards is formally lost and the lectotypes of Acrodicrania africana and Leia stigmatica are designated below. The family Mycetophilidae s.s. is one of the largest and most diverse families of Bibionomorpha, with approximately 180 extant genera and more than 4100 species worldwide (Pape et al. 2011). Edwards (1925), in a compilation on Mycetophilidae (s.l., including some Sciaridae and Bibionidae specimens) in the South African Museum, that had been forwarded to him by Dr L. Peringuey, described four new species of Mycetophilidae s.s. of which some of the syntypes are located in the SAMC. Edwards (1925) stated that he had been allowed to retain duplicate specimens in the Natural History Museum (NHM), London, collection evidently including some syntypes of the new species he described. The present paper provides a list of the type specimens of Mycetophilidae housed in the SAMC collection, with details on their label data and preservation condition. The list is in alphabetical order of genera. Label data are given in single quotation marks; handwritten text is reproduced in italics; completely handwritten and printed labels are reproduced in regular font. Additions and clarifications by the current authors to some of the original information on labels are included within square brackets. Particularly notable information on the types is in bold and underlined. Photographs were taken at the SAMC, Entomology collection, with a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W320. The Mycetophilidae type specimens in the SAMC collection are listed below.",

    "abstract": "The effect of manure application and host plant spacing on the infestation level and damage of Thrips tabaci in onion were investigated under field conditions and in cage experiments. Manure applications before and at transplanting were used in a factorial combination with three levels of plant spacing as treatments. Plots with no manure application were included as controls. In field experiments, significantly fewer number of adults and nymphs of T. tabaci per plant were recorded in plants grown in soil with manure applied before transplanting at a rate of 20 t/ha. Plants grown without manure application harboured significantly higher numbers of T. tabaci at 45 days after transplanting and late growth stages. Plots that received manure application before transplanting (20 t/ha) with 20 × 30 cm and 20 × 25 cm spacing showed markedly reduced mean thrips counts per plant, and had significantly higher leaf size compared to those transplanted with manure application (20 t/ha) and at 20 × 30 cm plant spacing. The extent of damage incurred on onion plants by natural infestation of T. tabaci was mostly mild at 15 and 30 days after transplanting and intermediate damage was recorded on plants at 45 days and late growth stages. On the other hand, plants in plots without manure application and 20 × 20 cm and 20 × 25 cm spacing showed markedly reduced leaf size and had intermediate damage at 15 and 30 days after transplanting and sustained severe attack as the crop matures. In cage experiments, significantly lower mean number of larvae and adults were recorded from pots with manure application before transplanting followed by at transplanting manure application as compared to plots with no manure application. This study illustrated that optimum organic manure application at the appropriate time had an effect on the infestation level of onion thrips. Therefore, manure application three months before transplanting was found to be the critical period for optimum plant growth and had the lowest onion thrips infestation.",

    "abstract": "Two-year field trials were conducted to evaluate the role of spacing in managing flea beetle, Podagrica sp., infestation in two okra cultivars. Three seeds were planted per hole and later thinned to one seedling per hole at two weeks after planting (WAP). The four planting spacings used were 60 × 70 cm, 60 × 60 cm, 60 × 50 cm and 60 × 40 cm. The experiment was replicated three times and conducted using split plot fitted into a randomized complete block design with planting spacing as main treatment and cultivars as sub-treatment. The okra cultivars planted at close spacing of 60 × 50 cm and 60 × 40 cm had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower pods length and high mean leaf area damage. The highest mean number of flea beetles (24.50 and 23.17) were from the okra cultivars Jokoso and NH-Ae 47-4 planted at the closest spacing of 60 × 40 cm. Cumulative of the two planting seasons, the highest yield per plant (138.17) was obtained from plots planted at 60 × 70 cm with the okra cultivar NH-Ae 47-4. It was however, not (P > 0.05) higher than yield/plant (129.17 g) from plots planted at 60 × 60 cm. In both seasons and cumulatively, a significantly (P < 0.05) lower pod yield per plant was obtained from plots planted at closest plant spacing of 60 × 40 cm. Irrespective of cultivar, okra planted at close spacing of 60 × 50 cm and 60 × 40 cm were significantly (P < 0.05) taller than okra in other plots. Cumulative of the two seasons, the number of pods (22.95), length of pod (6.71), number of leaves (8.96) and yield/plant (118.25 g) were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in Jokoso. Planting okra at planting spacing of 60 × 70 cm or 60 × 60 cm could manage the population of flea beetle, minimize damage to leaves and guarantee optimum yield from planted okra.",

During recent surveys in Kenya several parasitoid species were recovered from Mussidia species, including the egg parasitoid, Trichogrammatoidea sp. nr lutea Girault (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatoidea). This parasitoid species is considered a potential biocontrol agent for M. nigrivenella in West Africa and development of a successful rearing system for its host, M. fiorri, will enable the mass production of this natural enemy species. The suitability of five artificial diets for the development of M. fiorii as well as optimum rearing conditions were evaluated in the laboratory. The effect of temperature and humidity on the development of M. fiorii was also studied. Mussidia fiorii successfully developed on maize leaf-, maize seed- and Canavalia ensiformes seed-based diets. The lower developmental thresholds for the egg, larvae, pupae, and egg to adult were 12.8 ± 0.25 °C, 14.4 ± 0.27 °C, 11.0 ± 0.03 °C and 13.5 ± 0.21 °C, respectively, while the thermal constants were 82.0 ± 1.61, 384.6 ± 9.4,144.9 ± 6.8 and 588.2 ± 10.8 degree-days, respectively.

The goal of this paper was to study bee mortality in an experiment with different densities in each experimental unit observed over time.

Forty eight thousand and forty nine anophelines of 12 species were collected. The plot of number caught versus rank order was best descriptionbed by a log series. The overall Simpson index of diversity was 0.71. A maximum correlation between the index of diversity and rainfall occurred after a nine-day lag. Anopheles gambiae s.l., An. funestus Giles and An. squamosus Theobald were the most common mosquitoes, accounting for 38 %,25 % and 25 % of the total collected. Parous rates were similar in all three species. Time-series estimates of survival rate based on time-series analysis were not possible due to non-significant cross correlations between nulliparous and parous insects. Survival, from parous rate determination, was estimated to be 0.79, 0.78 and 0.79 per day. Sporozoite rates, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in An. Gambiae s.1. and An. funestus were 1.2 % and 0.7 % respectively. All other species tested were negative. Numbers of An. squamosus varied according to rainfall. 7.9 % of the An. Squamosus were infected with a nematode parasite. The population of An. funestus peaked just before the the rice harvest, when a maximum of 1275 individuals were collected during one night. Peak An. welleomi Theobald numbers were recorded in May after the main rains had ended. Numbers of An. coustani Laveran and An. ziemanni Grunberg fluctuated synchronously.",

At three sites, significantly more Cryptophlebia eggs were laid on nuts at the bottom of the canopy. There was a decrease in the number of eggs with increasing height in the tree at all sites. Differences between the number of eggs at the middle and top of the trees were not significant at two sites. Differences in the level of oviposition at the centre and periphery of the canopy were also not significant. Although all sites showed a slight increase in percentage parasitism of Cryptophlebia eggs by T. cryptophlebiae with height in the tree, none of these increases was statistically significant. At two sites, there was a decrease in the number of viable and dead Cryptophlebia eggs with increasing height. The differences in the number of live, hatched and dead eggs at the centre and periphery of the canopy were not significant. A higher percentage parasitism did not cause reductions in the number of borer-damaged nuts, and there was a weak negative correlation between the percentage of mature nuts and the percentage of borer damage at all of the sites. These findings suggest that monitoring for pest management decisions should be concentrated at the bottom of the tree canopy.",

The species previously reported from Mahe and Praslin in the Seychelles and Reunion Island, is now recorded from other Mascarene Islands (Mauritius and Flat Island) and the Seychelles (Cousine Island). A comparative study of male specimens originating from the Seychelles, Mauritius and Reunion showed no significant differences. In the Seychelles, the species is reported only on the exotic and invasive shrub Chrysobalanus icaco L. (Chrysobalanaceae); in the Mascarene Islands this leafhopper is common on a native shrub, Scaveola taccada (Gaertn.) Roxb. (Goodeniaceae). In Reunion it is also associated with an endemic shrub, Abutilon exstipulare (Cav.) G. Don (Malvaceae), an endemic vine, Cissus anulata Descoing (Vitaceae), and the native shrub, Dodonea viscosa L. (Sapindaceae). In Reunion, only the tree, Vitex trifolia L. (Verbenaceae), is reported as an exotic host-plant. This association with dicotyledonous host-plants from diverse families shows that M. determinatus is a polyphagous species. The distribution of the species in Mascarenes is restricted to the coastal dry or semi-dry and hot areas. (Resume d'auteur)",

It is estimated that South Africa currently has approximately 4 million trees in the ground, of which 41% are still less than 5 years old (Lee 2006). The South African industry has grown by approximately 15-20 % per annum and this growth is conservatively set to continue through to 2010 (Lee 2003). The macadamia crop is a valuable earner of foreign revenue and approximately 97 % of the 2005 / 06 South African crop, valued at ± R300 million, was exported (Lee 2006). South Africa is currently the second largest producer of macadamia nuts after Australia (Piza 2006).",

    "abstract": "The development of Saharan agriculture in recent decades by increasing irrigated areas for vegetable production in central Sahara has led to significant outbreaks of locusts. This insect, which is not a deserticola type, has succeeded in developing a series of behavioural, morphological and physiological characteristics to adapt to this environment which has become one of its areas of reproduction and dispersal This work aims at evaluating the morphometric variation of locusts in two different habitats located in the southern Sahara, natural and cultivated environments. The results of biometric analysis on male and female populations, conducted from 1993 to 2004, primarily on the elytra (E), femur (F) and head capsule (C), revealed the existence of differences between locusts from two locations. Population densities were low and did not exceed 500 individuals per hectare, except in April 2004 when a maximum of 10 000 individuals/ha was reached in Adrar. Morphometric ratios (E/F and F/C) of the studied populations oscillate between the solitary and transiens-dissocians phases, except for populations in June 2004 in Tamanrasset and April 1998 in Adrar, which were gregarious. Analyses of variance both with and without population density as a covariate, showed the effect of density on measured traits. Separate analysis of variance of males and females emphasized a marked seasonal effect on the femur and head capsule, especially in Adrar. The male population at this location In the dry season presented shorter femur and smaller head capsule measurements than those present in the wet season at the same location and those of Tamanrasset. This result shows the influence of seasons and weather conditions on morphometric traits. A seasonal dimorphism in size coupled with a contrast of phase status has been highlighted in male populations of Adrar. The relationship between human activities and the change in morphometric traits at the locations studied is discussed. These results are of significance in preventing the proliferation of the desert locust.",

The oxygen affinity and molecular cooperativities of haemocyanin in its native and dialysed form were determined when exposed to different ambient temperatures. D-lactate concentration in native haemolymph increased significantly from 0.31 mmol/l at 7 °C to 1.93 mmol/l when haemolymph was exposed to 25 °C for 6 hours but decreases to 0.32 mmol/l at 37 °C The extinction coefficients of O. latimanus haemocyanin at 240 nm and 278 nm were 2.41 and 11.26, respectively, and correspond well with similar data on the crustacean Limulus polyphemus. The subunit cooperativity (n50) of the native haemocyanin molecule increased linearly from n = 3.00 to n = 5.34 at 37 °C. A d-lactate effect on n50 between pH 7.40 and 7.87 could be demonstrated while the heat of oxygenation (ΔH) was -127.64 kJ/mol between 17 °C and 25 °C Like other scorpions investigated, haemocyanin of O. latimanus exposed to wide temperature regimes show a strong temperature dependence of oxygen affinity (as P50) and cooperativity (as n50).",

Harmonia axyridis made up the highest mean number of coccinellids collected per site over the collecting period, followed by Hippodamia variegata, Cheilomenes lunata, Exochomusflavipes and Micraspis sp. No indigenous parasitoids were observed attacking H. axyridis. The numbers of H. axyridis on the vines were negatively correlated with temperature but positively with rainfall. In view of the migration of H. axyridis from the vines in December, they appear not to pose any risk of contaminating grapes during harvest and tainting wine as most wine grapes are harvested from January onwards.",

Among the three neonicotinoids, acetamiprid showed the highest toxicity to B. brevicornis with a LC50 of 0.0041mga.i./l followed by thiamethoxam and imidacloprid. The order of toxicity based on the LC50 values was: carbosulfan > lambdacyhalothrin > bifenthrin > indoxacarb > acetamiprid > thiamethoxam > imidacloprid > buprofezin>pymetrozine. Pymetrozine showed slight to moderate toxicity to B. brevicornis, with a risk quotient (RQ) of 1420, while the RQ value for all other insecticides were dangerously toxic to B. brevicornis.

    "abstract": "Gratiana spadicea (Klug), a leaf-feeding tortoise beetle native to South America, was released in South Africa for the biological control of Solanum sisymbriifolium Lamarck (wild tomato), despite its ability to develop on cultivated eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) during laboratory host-specificity tests. Our studies in Argentina, during which beetle colonies were reared and sustained on both plant species, were aimed at determining whether a host range extension could be induced and thus whether eggplant crops may be under future threat in South Africa. During no-choice tests conducted under natural climatic conditions, larvae reared on potted eggplants suffered significantly higher mortality, longer developmental times and lower pupal masses than those reared on potted wild tomato. During choice tests under laboratory conditions, adult beetles fed significantly more on wild tomato than on eggplant, irrespective of whether the larvae were reared on eggplant or wild tomato, although the larger wild tomato-reared beetles consumed more than the smaller adults reared on eggplant. Under natural climatic conditions, females oviposited exclusively on wild tomato plants regardless of larval feeding history. During no-choice fecundity tests, females reared as larvae and adults on wild tomato had a significantly shorter preoviposition period and higher fecundity than females reared as larvae on wild tomato and as adults on eggplant, or as larvae and adults on eggplant. A significant percentage of females that spent part or all of their life cycle on eggplant laid only anomalous eggs (without a structure for leaf adhesion) or no eggs at all, whereas all females reared exclusively on wild tomato laid only normal eggs. The artificial rearing of G. spadicea on eggplant thus did not induce changes in adult feeding and oviposition preferences within the same generation, suggesting that eggplant is highly unlikely to serve as a viable alternative host for G. spadicea. Our study thus provides additional support for the decision taken to release G. spadicea in South Africa for the biological control of S. sisymbriifolium.",

    "abstract": "Many human activities have an impact on the fauna and flora of the South African Grassland Biome, including agriculture, fire and urbanisation. Disturbances in grassland habitats often result in Hyparrhenia hirta, a native pioneer grass species, establishing dense stands. Here the assemblage composition, species richness and abundance of spiders associated with H. hirta tussocks was investigated at three grassland sites (annually burnt, suburban local road traffic and undisturbed control) in the central Free State Province of South Africa during winter 2015 and 2016. Further, inter-annual differences during a period of intense drought were evaluated. An increase in spider species richness, abundance and different assemblage composition with increased tussock height and basal circumference was expected, and we predicted these effects would differ between land use types. Overall, Tibellus spp. immatures (Philodromidae) and Poachelas striatus Haddad & Lyle, 2008 (Trachelidae) were the most abundant spider species, while Philodromidae and Gnaphosidae were the most abundant spider families at all three sites during both years. The most species-rich families were Gnaphosidae, Salticidae and Thomisidae. Over the two-year sampling period there was a significant decline in overall spider abundance (58.09 %) and species richness (28.17 %), which could be explained by the cumulative effects of a severe drought experienced in central South Africa during 2015 and 2016. Species richness and assemblage composition were influenced by tussock basal circumference and disturbance effects, but not by tussock height. Several species were associated with the control site, while certain diversity metrics of the burnt and road verge sites were more stable, pointing to the importance of primary productivity in the former and water in the latter, for spider diversity. Trade-offs related to disturbance need to be carefully considered when developing management strategies for biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Global demand for high-quality animal protein is expected to increase astronomically by 57 % come 2050 and meeting this demand will be quite challenging. However, insect as food is a safe alternative considering the fact that most insects have dietary quality. This is due to their rich protein content which is comparable with conventional animal sources of protein. In Nigeria, the pest Analeptes trifasciata is one of the edible insects, which is consumed among others such as grasshoppers, locusts, termites, palm weevils and crickets in most rural communities. The nutritive composition of adult male and female cashew stem girdler beetles (A. trifasciata) were analysed by proximate analysis to determine the crude protein, crude fibre, ash content, ether extract, dry matter and moisture content. Also minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, iron, cadmium, zinc and manganese and vitamin (A, B, C, D, E and K) contents were analysed using standard methods. Student t-test was used for the statistical analysis. The crude protein (39.63 ± 0.04 %), crude fibre (0.43 ± 0.01 %) and water content (53.03 ± 0.01 %) of males were significantly higher than that of females. Females recorded higher values of dry matter compared to males. Males recorded significantly higher vitamin content than females, for vitamin B1 (0.216 ± 0.001 mg/100 g), vitamin B2 (0.058 ± 0.001 mg/100 g), vitamin B12 (1.37 ± 0.01 mg/100 g) and vitamin C (0.89 ± 0.01 mg/100 g). Females recorded significantly higher (P < 0.05) contents of vitamins A (725.3 ± 0.12 µg/100 g), D (189.5 ± 0.12 mg/100 g), E (266.7 ± 0.12 mg/100 g) and K (31.8 ± 0.12 mg/100 g). Females had higher mineral contents of Ca2+, Na+, P+, Fe2+ and Mn–. The results show that A. trifasciata has high protein content making the beetle a cheap and excellent source of protein. The micronutrients are in favourable proportions and the beetle can be explored as a strategy for tackling nutritional deficiencies.",

F.Muell. (Myrtaceae). Whilst both agents are established and widespread, L. laevigatum continues to grow vigorously and spread within its range. Earlier studies reported decreasing populations and reasonably high levels of mortality of the midge; however, the role of this mortality in regulating D. strobila populations was not proven. A re-assessment of the mortality factors on D. strobila confirmed the continued presence of both parasitoids and a predatory mite, accounting for only 5 % and 4.9 % mortality respectively over a two-year period. Whilst outbreaks of predatory mites could occur, mortality is not believed to be a driving force in regulating D. strobila populations. Although further studies are required to clarify the situation, it is suggested that despite the presence, and relative abundance of the midge, its impact as a biocontrol agent for Australian myrtle, remains negligible.",

Bee workers were captured while returning from the field to the hive (about 23 days old). When honey bee foragers were exposed to mobile phone radiation for 20 min, the stomach cells were completely decayed. With regard to stomach cells which were exposed for 10 min, some parts of the cells were completely lysed, appeared as a thin tubular-like layer, or as compact mass, and the internal plasma membranes were not clear. Also, the chemical element composition of the cells exposed to 10 min of mobile phone radiation was affected as follows: Mg, Ca, Zn and Fe elements were significantly increased, while sulphate elements were significantly decreased. The current study demonstrated that mobile phone radiation is harmful to honey bee stomach cells, and we recommend limiting the use of mobile phones near hives.",

Both over-harvesting of larvae and the destruction of the mopane woodlands are threatening its biodiversity. An insect with a description matching that of I. belina was observed in the northern coastal region of KwaZulu-Natal, a subtropical biota. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the potential of the northern coastal region of KwaZulu-Natal as a sanctuary for I. belina. The presence of I. belina in the subtropical biota of the coastal region of KwaZulu-Natal was confirmed through mitochondrion CO1 gene sequences, this being so far its southernmost occurrence. Field surveys revealed the occurrence of four morphologically distinct variants within the uMkhanyakude District, inclusive of the protected iSimangaliso Wetland Park and Hluhluwe Game Reserve from the beginning of September to early November as do most of the populations in the mopane woodlands but differs from them by having one outbreak per season instead of two. Imbrasia belina is polyphagous and feeds off hosts including marula (Sclerocarya birrea [(A. Rich.) Hochst.] [Anacardiaceae]) and seven other tree species. There is therefore scope to use the northern KwaZulu-Natal coastal region as a sanctuary for biodiversity conservation of I. belina. There are initiatives to cultivate marula for its fruit in the region, which further increases the potential of the area as a sanctuary for I. belina by farming marula for both its fruit and I. belina. The protected nature reserves present in the region will ensure areas of controlled use by humans.",

In this study, the toxicity of various concentrations of four insecticides, a thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin combination, indoxacarb, acetamiprid, and hexaflumuron, were assessed against second-instar larvae of T. absoluta. Results showed that indoxacarb with a LC50 value of 7.13 mg a.i./l was more toxic than acetamiprid, thiamethoxam + lambdacyhalothrin, and hexaflumuron. Sub-lethal effects of insecticides on demographic and biological parameters of T. absoluta were evaluated using LC30 concentrations estimated from bioassays. The lowest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was shown in indoxacarb treatments (0.083/day). Except for hexaflumuron, the net reproductive rate (R0) and gross reproductive rate (GRR) were significantly lower in all treatments compared to the control. The shortest and longest adult longevities were shown in the indoxacarb treatment (18.92 days) and the control (26.94 days), respectively. The lowest fecundity was observed in the indoxacarb treatment (46.62 offspring/female). Except for hexaflumuron, the pupal weight was significantly decreased in all insecticide treatments. With the results of this study, combined with acute toxicity data, the significant adverse effects of indoxacarb, acetamiprid, and thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin on demographic and biological parameters of T. absoluta larvae were determined providing support for their consideration in commercial use in suppressing this pest.",

Using three species of tsetse flies belonging to two subgenera, Nemorhina and Glossina, our data provide a first answer to the following question: do the juvenile stages of tsetse flies provide metric traits allowing reliable species and/or sex identification? We compared three species using their wings and their pupae: Glossina palpalis gambiensis, Glossina tachinoides and Glossina morsitans submorsitans. To separate size and shape information, 11 landmarks per wing were submitted to the Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA). The contour of the pupae was processed by elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA).A validated reclassification method was used to compare the taxonomic power of each organ, as well as its utility for sex recognition. The contour of the pupae did not provide a satisfactory species signal (75 %), relative to the one obtained from wing landmarks (99 %). However, the overall pupae size was much more satisfactory than the wings size (93 % versus 57 %). In spite of a lower taxonomic signal, the morphometric variation observed on pupae was in agreement with known phylogenetic relationships. Contrary to the wings, sexual dimorphism was much reduced in pupae and not strong enough to allow any reliable sex identification.",

Two adult Merino sheep were humanely killed (each in cold and warm season) at Ukulinga Research and Training Farm of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Five decomposition stages were observed as fresh, bloated, active, advanced and dry stages. Calliphoridae, Muscidae and Sarcophagidae flies comprising of Chrysomya marginalis (Wiedemann), Ch. putoria (Wiedemann), Ch. albiceps (Wiedemann), Ch. chloropyga (Wiedemann.), Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann), Musca domestica (Walker) and Sarcophaga calcifera (Boettcher) were recorded. Colonisation by coleopterans during the warm season started as early as the fresh stage with Dermestes maculatus (De Geer), Thanatophilus micans (Fabricius) and Onthophagus crassicollis (Boucomont), whilst the same species were collected from the bloated stage in the cold season. Chrysomya marginalis, M. domestica, D. maculatus, T. micans and O. crassicollis persisted on the carcass throughout the five stages of decomposition during the warm season. Results from this study generated important information on the endemic arthropod species that are attracted to sheep carcass during the warm and cold season in a locality of the KwaZulu-Natal province and their succession pattern can be further investigated as potential indicator species in estimating the post-mortem interval in this locality.",

Here, we describe progress-to-date with the insect agents and factors that have contributed to their success or failure. In particular we cover: (i) research on the ability of the seed-feeding weevil, Erytenna consputa Pascoe (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to recolonise burnt areas after fire; (ii) the impacts and dispersal ability of the seed-feeding moth, Carposina autologa Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae); (iii) the impacts and future prospects for the stem-boring beetle, Aphanasium australe (Boisduval) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae); and (iv) the establishment discrepancy observed for the flowerbud-feeding weevil, Dicomada rufa Blackburn (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). In general, findings show: (i) E. consputa is able to quickly re-establish populations after fires; (ii) that C. autologa has a modest impact and disperses slowly; (iii) A. australe is performing relatively well in the field, with healthy localised populations in South Africa which should be left to increase before harvesting and redistribution of the beetle commences; (iv) climate mismatch between native and introduced ranges is a problem for D. rufa, along with other possible causes for establishment discrepancies which are still under investigation. As a result of these findings, we provide suggestions for possible management plans for some of the agents, so as to maximize resources and increase the overall impact of the H. sericea biological control programme in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "The ‘lesser dung fly’, Archicollinella penteseta (Richards), previously known only from the Scilly Isles of Great Britain, was discovered on three of Namibia's off-shore guano islands, Ichaboe, Mercury and Possession islands, in 2003, from where the species was presumably introduced to Great Britain. Adults were found to feed on the guano of seabirds, in the nests of Jackass penguins and on carcasses and scats of Cape fur seals. The third instar larva and puparium are described, this being the first description of immature stages for the genus. Species dominance of guano-producing seabirds and Cape fur seals has altered on these islands during the last 180 years or so, since the onset of human exploitation. Changing larval food resources are discussed by drawing on historical accounts of the islands. Introduction of the species to Great Britain could have resulted directly from the guano trade between Namibia and Great Britain in the 1840s or later, probably as a result of mass fly emergence, dumped ballast from sailing ships or shipwrecks off the coast of the Scilly Isles.",

PDVs have double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes that are segmented, with up to 30 circular dsDNAs reported (Espagne et al. 2004; Kroemer & Webb 2004; Pennacchio & Strand 2006). The PDVs of both ichneumonids (ichnoviruses) and braconids (bracoviruses) occur as proviruses integrated in the wasp genome, with replication and virus particle production occurring only in the wasp ovaries in a region called the calyx (Fleming 1992; Albrecht et al. 1994; Strand & Pech 1995). A very high number of virus particles (containing circular episomal forms of the integrated DNA genome) are released (by cell rupture in braconids) or secreted (by ichneumonids) from the calyx cells into the oviducts and during oviposition the PDVs are injected with the eggs and ovarian fluid into the host larvae (Stoltz & Vinson 1979; Fleming 1992; Dupuy et al. 2006). Although there is no PDV replication in the wasp's host, PDV gene expression in the host disrupts the host's development and cellular defence systems thus allowing the wasp's progeny to survive and complete their development (Strand & Pech 1995; Webb 1998; Pennacchio & Strand 2006; Webb et al. 2006).",

Information on the genetic diversity and the role of host crop and environmental differentiation in their diversity in East Africa is scanty. The knowledge on genetic diversity is a critical component in the development of sound and sustainable integrated pest management strategy, from detection to control. A portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was used to characterise the species of aphids on amaranth and nightshades at different agro-ecological zones of Kenya and Tanzania. Aphid samples were collected in localities growing the vegetables in low, mid and high altitude agro-ecological zones. Total DNA was isolated and amplified using universal barcoding primers targeting the 5′ end of the COI barcode region. Nucleotide sequences of the COI barcode, using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool model, found high homology to four species of aphids: Myzus persicae, Aphis fabae, Aphis craccivora and Macrosiphum euphorbiae. Three subspecies of the A. fabae were also detected. Intraspecific diversity depicted M. euphorbiae having the lowest value, while A. fabae showed the highest diversity. Interspecific diversity between A. fabae and A. craccivora was the lowest while between A. craccivora and M. persicae it was the highest. The phylogenetic tree showed each species clustering together irrespective of the host crop or site where collected. Principal component analysis and haplotype network analyses confirmed these results. Low genetic diversity revealed by COI suggests that the environment or host crop contribute less to the genetic diversity of aphids in both countries.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the potential of mass trapping to reduce Prostephanus truncatus population numbers in granaries and hence its possible utilisation as pest management tool. Universal moth traps (Uni-traps) were used to trap the pest and its predator, Teretrius nigrescens Lewis (Coleoptera: Histeridae), in granaries of small-scale farmers in three villages of the Gaza Province of Mozambique during the maize storage period of August 2013 to January 2014. Five granaries were selected in each village. Two baited pheromone traps were set up adjacent to each of three of these granaries. The other two granaries were used as controls, without traps. Numbers of both the pest and its predator were monitored in these traps as well as in stored maize ears inside the granaries for a 6-month period. Mean numbers and densities of P. truncatus, the percentage damaged maize kernels and maize kernel weight loss in granaries with and without traps were compared by means of t-tests. The Cohen's standard of effect size was applied to measure the magnitude of differences between studied variables. An average of 1272 individuals of P. truncatus was caught per trap. Mean densities of P. truncatus recorded per maize ear in granaries with traps were lower (27 individuals/ear) than of those without traps (129 individuals/ear). Mean numbers of T. nigrescens per trap followed similar patterns between granaries with and without traps. The percentage of damaged maize kernels was higher (62 %) in granaries without traps than in those with traps (22 %). Highly significant negative correlations were found between mean numbers of P. truncatus caught in traps and mean infestation in maize ears inside granaries. These findings indicate that mass trapping holds potential for control of P. truncatus in granaries of small-scale farmers.",

The results obtained revealed that Giza 35 variety was the most susceptible variety with significant difference between the mean numbers of T. urticae compared with other varieties. The mean rate of infestation was 11.89 individuals/25 cm2 of leaves, while the mean number of T. urticae was 7.11 and 3.54 individuals/25 cm2 of leaves for Giza 111 and Giza 82 without significant difference. Giza 22 recorded the lowest mean number of T. urticae, 1.53 individuals/25 cm2. The population dynamics of T. urticae showed that infestation increased gradually from mid-June reach its maximum at the end of July, and then decreased gradually at the beginning of August, reaching its minimum number at the beginning of September before harvest time. As for A. exsertus, data showed that the mean number of A. exsertus was the highest on Giza 35 (2.46 individuals/25 cm2) followed by Giza 22 (2.13 individuals/25 cm2), but Giza 82 and Giza 111 mean numbers were 1.99, and 1.91 individuals/25 cm2. Life cycle of tetranychid males was the shortest when reared on Giza 35 with significant difference with other varieties. As for females the shortest life cycle was when reared on Giza 35 with significant difference with Giza 22 which recorded the longest life cycle for males and females, respectively.",

Proteolytic processing of Cry1Ab toxins with trypsin indicated that the replacement of each surface-exposed loop caused no damage to toxin stability. Results of in vitro binding and competition assay indicated that, similarly to the native Cry1Ab toxin, the mutants retained almost the same binding affinity and specificity with brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of H. armigera. Nevertheless, H. armigera larvae fed with each loop-replaced Cry1Ab mutant showed less growth inhibition in comparison with those fed with native Cry1Ab toxin. The most significant decrease in toxicity was observed from larvae fed with loop 2-replaced Cry1Ab mutant, with a c. 12-fold increase in the weight of tested larvae relative to that of larvae fed native Cry1Ab toxin. The results demonstrate that the replacement of three surface-exposed loops located in domain II of Cry1Ab toxin may result in a certain reduction in the toxicity. Relative to loop 1 and loop 3, loop 2 seem to play a more important role in generating toxicity of Cry1Ab against H. armigera larvae.",

No significant difference was found in the autogeny rate when F3 female mosquitoes from an autogenous colony mated with males either from an autogenous or anautogenous colony. Similarly, when F3 males from an autogenous colony mated with females either from an autogenous or anautogenous colony, statistically comparable autogeny rates were recorded. However, when females from an anautogenous colony were allowed to mate with males from an autogenous colony, the autogeny rate was statistically higher than that when females from an autogenous colony mated with males from an anautogenous colony. Molecular analysis using ISSR was suitable for detecting polymorphic banding patterns between autogenous and anautogenous specimens of mosquitoes. The ISSR technique succeeded in showing 13 different molecular markers which can be relied upon in distinguishing between populations. Molecular distances among populations were low, ranging between 0.114 and 0.284. On the other hand, cluster and principal coordinate analyses showed that anautogenous specimens were contiguous in one group and separate from autogenous specimens. The ISSR technique is therefore able to detect genetic differentiation among the studied populations, and to distinguish between autogenous and anautogenous mosquitoes from the northern coast of Egypt.",

Counts were made at five randomly selected spots, consisting of five plants in each spot. Results revealed that the highest peak of 65 thrips per plant was observed during fourth standard meteorological week (SMW). Further, irrespective of the years, higher numbers of thrips were observed during third to sixth SMW. Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.587*) with HTR and a significant negative correlation with maximum temperature (r = –0.628*) and minimum temperature (r = –0.566*). The linear and logarithmic regression analysis between HTR and thrips population had explained 50 % of variation. Thus, the present study suggests that apart from temperature, prevailing humid thermal ratio during the growth period could have an impact on occurrence of thrips in bulb onion.",

    "abstract": "Bathycoelia distincta is one of the most dominant stink bug pests associated with macadamia orchards in South Africa. Understanding the toxicity and sublethal effects of insecticides on this pest is essential for its effective management. This study tested four commercial insecticide formulations, consisting of one organophosphate (acephate) and three pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, beta-cyfluthrin and tau-fluvalinate). The toxicity of these insecticides and their behavioural effects on mobility were assessed. The sublethal effects of lambda-cyhalothrin on the biological parameters of parent B. distincta (F0) and offspring generations (F1) were also determined by treating B. distincta adults with sublethal concentrations (LC10 and LC30). In toxicity bioassays, acephate was more toxic to B. distincta than lambda-cyhalothrin, beta-cyfluthrin and tau-fluvalinate. Behavioural changes were only observed in bugs exposed to pyrethroids, resulting in an increase in the distance walked and decrease of angular velocity. In the F0 generation, LC30 reduced the fecundity whereas the LC10 and LC30 accelerated development of the F1 generation. These results suggest that pyrethroids may enhance the dispersal of this pest and stimulate the growth of offspring populations. Further experiments should be conducted to confirm these results and understand the mechanism of action of pyrethroids on B. distincta.",

    "abstract": "Following copulation, sperm of multiple honeybee (Apis mellifera (A.m.) Linnaeus (Apidae)) drones are mixed inside the spermatheca of a queen, and sperm behaviour in this environment is of importance for sperm survival and successful fertilization. The polyandrous mating system of honeybees further may allow for cryptic female choice and sperm competition to select for specific sperm traits to enable successful reproduction. This preliminary study therefore examined multiple sperm quality parameters in mixed drone semen. Thirty-one drone ejaculates were collected and split to be mixed with one and two other drones’ semen. A computerised sperm analysis system was used for analysing sperm functionality parameters, at baseline and 60 minutes. Morphology measurements included head, tail, and total sperm length. Sperm concentration was significantly higher in three-drone samples compared to other groups (p &lt; 0.001), while comparisons of sperm functional and morphometric parameters did not reveal differences. However, after 60 minutes, mixed semen samples displayed changes in terms of sperm functionality. The motility percentage significantly decreased in two-drone samples (p = 0.004). In contrast, three-drone samples had consistently lower motility and kinematic parameters at baseline, but following an hour it was the only group to show improvement in sperm progressive motility, swimming speed and kinematics. Sperm concentration correlated with the majority of functionality parameters, while, morphological measurements did not. Sperm functionality changes observed in this study, can be attributed to a combination of factors, including, mixing of drone semen, sperm concentration, and time allowing for potential sperm interaction.",

The species studied is a member of the telecoprid (dung roller) Scarabaeini, but behaved here like a paracoprid; it deliberately cut into and removed flesh from the dead snake; these pieces were then taken into a feeding burrow; later a pheromone release stance was taken up near an established burrow; and under laboratory conditions the snake was completely buried. These observations, mostly novel for this species and its genus are clearly documented via photographs and an online time lapse video taken every hour for 24-hours during the snake’s-(re)burial. This note introduces relevant aspects of dung beetle natural history and new biological information for Scarabaeolus and particularly for Sc. carniphilus. It records and interprets a carrion specialist Scarabaeini dung beetle burying and feeding on fresh carrion; highlights natural history findings (pheromone release) previously not considered for the evolution of the Scarabaeini; and aims to stimulate behavioural research into this interesting and under studied genus Scarabaeolus.",

Here we elucidate associations between sub-cortical beetles, mites, and ophiostomatoid fungi from trees in Afromontane forests in South Africa. Bark and wood samples were collected from native tree species and exotic Pinus radiata and Acacia mearnsii that showed signs of sub-cortical beetle activity, or from wounds on storm-damaged trees. Ophiostomatoid fungi, a group that contains numerous tree pathogens, were isolated from beetles that emerged from samples, their galleries, phoretic mites on these beetles, and from wounds and wound-associated mites. Fungal isolates were identified using multiple DNA markers. Twenty sub-cortical beetle, 22 mite and 16 ophiostomatoid fungal species were recovered from only a few native and exotic host tree species. Three fungal species are likely undescribed despite increased focus on this ecologically and economically important group worldwide. Significantly, some mites and fungi were isolated from native and non-native hosts. Wound-associated fungi and mites were less host-specific than sub-cortical beetle-associated taxa. We highlight the rich and still unexplored symbioses between sub-cortical beetles, mites, and ophiostomatoid fungi in Afromontane forests and provide a foundation for future studies on the ecology of these important organisms.",

Compared with South Africa and Lesotho together, the Kalahari is a species-poor region of low endemicity. Most species seem to occur in the northeast, and the lowest number in the central Kalahari. Apart from endemics, various distributional components of the fauna are identified. As expected, there is a Southwest Arid Region component and an element of the tropical Zambezian Region centred northeast of the Kalahari. Another, major component is a group of species whose distributions span the arid-mesic divide in Africa south of Zambia. The Zambezian element, while making a major qualitative contribution to the fauna of the northeastern Kalahari, becomes attenuated towards the southwest. This, together with the paucity and low endemicity of the total fauna and other evidence, supports the view that the Kalahari Desert cannot be regarded as a distinct biogeographical region. However, there may be a group of widespread common species which provide some coherence to the greater part of the Kalahari.",

Adult weevils appeared before flowering and fed on cowpea leaves and flowers before switching to newly formed pods. Pod-feeding produced holes on the pod wall mesocarp through which the female layed a cluster of 2-5 ovoid, semi-translucent eggs; the eggs hatched 3-4 days later. Three larval stages fed on the peas and pupated within the pod, usually near the damaged peas. Juveniles continued to feed in the mature harvested cowpea pods in storage; adults emerged up to two weeks after harvest. Development was completed within 16-17 days and the adults lived for more than five months. Post-harvest cowpea seed damage peaked two weeks after harvest.

During the off-season for cowpea, P. varius adults survived on cowpea haulm residue left in the field and on surrounding cultivated and indigenous alternate hosts. The implication of this bio-ecological information in the management of P. varius populations is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Control of groundnut soil pests is seldom undertaken by resource-poor farmers in Nigeria, mainly due to ignorance of the appropriate control methods or lack of financial resources to purchase the necessary pesticides. In order to recommend to farmers appropriate control periods for the major soil pests of groundnuts and thus minimize cost, field trials were set up in farmers' fields at two sites in the Sudan savanna zone of northern Nigeria in 1996 and 1997 to monitor soil pests. Results showed that the major soil pests were termites, whitegrubs and millipedes. Termite attack on groundnut increased with plant maturity whereas whitegrub and millipede attacks were most critical at the early growth and pod formation stages, respectively. Therefore, resource-poor groundnut farmers in termite- or millipede-endemic areas may achieve some degree of control by applying pesticides at pegging to guard against the critical period of attack on soft or mature pods. In areas where groundnut is more prone to whitegrub attack, pesticide application will be most effective at the early stage of plant growth. Where all three groups of pests threaten groundnut production, a minimum of two pesticide applications, one at early plant growth and the second at pegging, is suggested.",

Recently, Amphicallia pactolicus (Butler) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), an indigenous insect, has become a major defoliator of the shrub in eastern and southern Africa. We studied the feeding habits of A. pactolicus and evaluated the suitability of different species of Crotalaria for its development. The life cycle of A. pactolicus is described for the first time. The larval stage of A. pactolicus passed through six instars. Larvae that fed on flowers and pods, gained body mass faster and had shorter larval duration compared to those that fed on leaves. Out of the eight Crotalaria species tested (C. agatiflora Schweinf., C. grahamiana Wight & Arn., C. laburnifolia L., C. ochroleuca G. Don., C. paulina Schrank, C. pycnostachya Benth., C. striata DC. Benth and C. incana L.), only C. incana was rejected by the larvae. A significant proportion of the food ingested was recycled back to the soil in the form of droppings. The nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations of the faeces were similar to those of the plant material ingested. Reproductive tissues of the plant are most affected, thus indicating greater risk for seed multiplication and less danger to short-duration (6-8 months) fallow planted for soil fertility benefits. Early infestation allows more generations of A. pactolicus to develop and has the potential to cause a significant biomass yield loss.",

A comparative study of the Arthropoda communities, focused on Coleoptera and Araneae, was conducted during one year, using pitfall traps (Barber traps) monthly. In total 7344 individuals, belonging to 215 species, including 80 species of Coleoptera and 38 species of Araneae were collected. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') varies between 0.41 and 2.95 bits. The results showed that Hassi Bahbah is richer and more diverse than Zaâfrane. The humidity and the organic matter are clearly higher in Hassi Bahbah than in Zaâfrane.

As an export-oriented industry, increasing the exportable percentage of avocado fruit is a major concern. A tussock moth, Bracharoa mixta (Snellen), is reported for the first time on avocado trees, scarring fruit and defoliating leaves. Feeding damage by the larva results in corky tissue development, making the fruit unsuitable for export. The study aimed to determine the identity of the larvae (morphologically and DNA barcoding) and ascertain levels of damage. Sequencing of the barcoding region of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was done. In-field fruit damage assessment of infested trees showed an 11 % scarring damage level resulting in 3.67 % downgrading of fruit. This represents a potential revenue loss of up to ZAR 1352.90/t (2.26 % revenue loss). The defoliating caterpillars also caused an 18.22 % reduction in leaf area. This study documents the potential of B. mixta to cause economic loss and sporadic, isolated outbreaks.",

Two-hundred honeybees were collected twice a month from the colonies in each of the apiaries to detect and identify ectoparasites using the ethanol wash method. Fifty honeybees (one quarter) were sampled from the selected colonies in each of the apiaries and subjected to microscopic examination and dissection for the assessment of associated endoparasites. All the colonies sampled were infested with Varroa destructor and the developmental stages of Acarapis woodi, although there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) observed in the infestation levels of all the colonies sampled. The mean of V. destructor infestation (12.70 ± 1.73/bee/colony) was recorded to be significantly higher in the bee colonies from Imosan apiary in July compared to those sampled from Ogbe (8.70 ± 1.51/bee/colony) and O.O.U. Ago-iwoye (6.10 ± 0.86/bee/ colony) apiaries.

Apiaries in agro-ecosystems within the southwestern region should be properly maintained or managed against infestation of Varroa destructor and Acarapis woodi to prevent an outbreak or spread of the parasites to other apiaries and other areas where beekeeping is being practiced in Nigeria.",

Four primers generated low molecular weight polymorphic patterns. The primer (A2) showed a particular DNA amplified band (∼600 bp) from the southern S. g. flaviventris that was not expressed in the northern S. g. gregaria. For further examination, southern blot hybridisation indicated that this sequence is extremely repeated in the genome of the S. g. flaviventris population but not to the northern population. Therefore, this sequence may be highly specific to the southern locusts. Also, the southern population may constitute an evolutionary dichotomy that occurred on the African continent and can separate the populations of the two locusts into two distinct species.",

The manager of the cigarette factory used the trap records to assess risk and implemented an empirical action threshold of 10 insects/week/trap. Post-fumigation data collection showed that the pest populations had been reduced by 87 %. The variability in the trap catches indicated an aggregated pattern of distribution and negative binomial distribution fitted the data more accurately than the Poisson distribution. From Iwao's Patchiness or Mean Crowding Regression, at high relative population densities, it was shown that the individuals may form colonies.

Four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, AmOr11, AmOr18 and AmOr170) have been identified and found to be preferentially expressed in drone antennae. However, few studies have investigated the regulation of these four drone Ors on drone mating behaviour. This study characterised the expression patterns of these Ors across different sexual developmental stages (immature and sexually mature) and different physiological statuses (flying and crawling), using both the antennae and brains of drones. qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression of four Ors were not significantly different in drone antennae between flying and crawling statuses at immature stage. However, all four Ors expression levels in brains of flying drones were significantly higher than those of crawling drones at mature stage. Moreover, only the expression level of Or170 was significantly higher in antennae of mature flying drones than crawling ones. Therefore, this study demonstrated a link between four candidate sex pheromone Ors transcriptional expression in the brains of honeybee drones and behaviour associated with sexual maturity and mating flight. In addition, Or170 might be involved in the maturation of honeybee drones' olfactory system, and in the organisation of odour-mediated mating behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the structure and composition of Diptera in Moroccan vineyard, using wet-traps sampling technique throughout 2017. The study focused on five varieties within Loudaya vineyard (west region of Marrakech, Morocco). Eleven different fly species were identified belonging to 10 families, Ceratitis capitata, Drosophilla suzukii and Thaumatiya notata were the most abundant species and first time behaviourally dominant flies species. In addition, more flies were captured in the local varieties (10 579 individuals) than in the introduced ones (966). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in fly richness, evenness and diversity between varieties. Fly community structure in Loudaya showed a clear seasonal dynamics, which richness, abundance, diversity and evenness were significantly (P < 0.001) dissimilar among months. Furthermore, Diptera species were positively influenced by humidity and rainfall. Richness (expected by sample-based rarefaction) and diversity peaked in the middle of vineyard phenology, corresponding to mid-spring to late-summer in all varieties. Fly species occurrence and seasonal climatic variation in Loudaya vineyard might be among various ecological factors such as habitat distribution, climate and the availability of resources. Taking into account the periods of fly abundance, the survey could give relevant indications on new approaches to integrated pest management (IPM) in Moroccan vineyards, particularly in the Loudaya region.",

Fecundity and survival, longevity, intrinsic rate increase (rm), net reproduction rate (R0), generation time (T), doubling time (Td) as well as finite rate of increase (λ) were used. The hypothesis of this study was that negative effects of groundnut varieties on life table parameters of P. interpunctella will indicate levels of resistance. Fecundity, survival and R0 varied significantly among varieties while the rest of parameters showed no significant differences. The lowest number of eggs laid and hatchability per female were significantly lower on variety BMM268. Gravid females stopped laying eggs by day 8 on Sellie and BMM268. The survival rates of P. interpunctella were lower on BMM268 and Sellie and the larvae were all dead by day 8. Plodia interpunctella had short life expectancy of 8 days when reared on varieties Sellie and BMM268 compared to other varieties. Variety BMM268 had significantly lower R0 than other varieties. Based on means, there was also a slightly prolonged larval developmental period on variety BMM268 than other varieties though not significant. Considering damage, varieties Sellie and BMM268 also had the lowest number of tunnels than others except G064-B. Susceptibility index ranged from 3.12–6.91 amongst varieties and the lowest was recorded on BMM268 followed by Sellie. This study shows that Sellie and BMM 268 are relatively unsuitable as hosts, indicating some level of resistance to P. interpunctella. The two groundnut varieties can be used in integrated pest management programmes to reduce damage caused by P. interpunctella during storage.",

    "abstract": "Host-associated genetic differentiation in grasshoppers has received limited attention, due to a lack of information on grasshopper-plant associations. The bladder grasshopper, Bullacris unicolor (Linnaeus, 1758) (Orthoptera: Pneumoridae), is a phytophagous species that can occur on at least six host plants within its geographic range. However, the relationship between host plant association and genetic variation of bladder grasshoppers has not been studied before. In light of this, the present study examined host plant-related genetic [mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene regions] and morphological (antennal length, body length, head width, abdomen width, femur length, tibia length and pronotum length) divergence within a population of B. unicolor. We used two plant species, belonging to different families, namely Didelta spinosa (L.fil.) Aiton (Asteraceae) and Roepera morgsana (L.) Beier &amp; Thulin (Zygophyllaceae), to evaluate variation between individuals collected on these two sympatric host plants at a single locality in the Northern Cape, South Africa. The results demonstrated non-significant host related genetic variation with very low values of FST, indicating a low level of variation. The phylogram strongly indicated that there are no host-associated genetic differences in B. unicolor by displaying limited genomic clustering, whereas some differentiation was observed between the morphological measurements of males and females among host plants. Further studies using microsatellite molecular markers may help to discern population genetic structure. In addition, significant host-associated morphological divergence highlights the need to examine the mechanisms by which host utilization affects morphological features.",

The attractiveness of collected volatiles of white clover flowers and of unopened (balloon stage) and open plum (Prunus salicina Lindl. cv.

Clover flower and open plum blossom volatiles exhibited statistically significant attraction of 69% and 71%, respectively, to WFT females. E-β-Farnesene and balloon stage plum blossom volatiles attracted 63% and 65% of WFT, respectively. When compared directly, 69% of WFT females chose the arm with the plum blossom volatiles over the clover flower volatiles. The clear preference shown by WFT for plum blossom volatiles indicates the use of a semiochemical to deter WFT from the plum blossoms would be required to enhance the efficacy of white clover as a trap crop in a push-pull strategy.",

The present study aimed to explore the susceptibility of different instar larvae of the common mosquito, Culex pipiens Linnaeus, 1758, to the mermithid nematode, Romanomermis iyengari Welch, 1964. Moreover, the effects of R. iyengari on the mosquito pupal developmental time, adult emergence, longevity, female fecundity, as well as egg-hatching rate were determined after larval treatment with an LC50 quantity of the nematode pre-parasites. Different instars of Cx. pipiens (1st–4th) were exposed separately to R. iyengari at concentrations of 1–6 pre-parasites/mosquito larva. Mortality rates of mosquito larvae were observed and the LC50 values were calculated. The estimated LC50 values for the 1st–4th larval instars were 3.18, 2.73, 3.79 and 4 pre-parasites/larva, respectively. Mean percent mortality of the 1st–4th larval instars ranged from 10–94%, 16–100%, 4–100% and 0–52%, respectively. The results indicated that exposure of 4th larval instar to the LC50 of R. iyengari pre-parasites significantly prolonged the duration of pupal development, reduced the percentage of emerged adults and reduced mosquito female fecundity compared with the control. In contrast, adult longevity and the egg-hatching rate did not differ between the control and the exposed group. In conclusion, this isolate of R. iyengari could be a promising biocontrol agent for Egyptian Cx. pipiens. Other trials are required to assess the biocontrol potential of this parasite in field conditions.",

High altitude sites were dominated by the Simulium ornatum (Meigen, 1818) group, whereas sites located on the southern slope of the Aures Mountains were occupied by the eurytopic Simulium velutinum (Santos Abreu, 1922) complex and the thermophilic, pollutant-tolerant Simulium ruficorne Macquart, 1838 ‘A’ morphotype.Co-inertia analysis was used to determine the relationship between a species’ abundance and habitat types. The co-inertia analysis revealed a likely co-structure between blackfly assemblages and measured environmental descriptors (water temperature, conductivity, current velocity, bed width, etc.) in sampled habitats. This confirmed the importance of altitude as a driver of blackfly distribution. Our results also showed that there has been an increase in anthropogenic pressures on the vulnerable freshwater biota of the Aures Mountains.",

Here we first estimated and defined sexual dimorphism in a poorly studied African cerambycid species, Cacosceles newmannii (Thomson, 1877). We then assessed morphological and physiological attributes of male beetles in relation to their fighting behaviour. Suites of morphological and energetic measurements were carried out on adult males, the latter before and after male-male interactions. Aggressive behaviour and the outcomes of male fighting trials were assessed under controlled conditions. The species is highly sexually dimorphic in relation to mandible size. During male-male interactions, a continuum of behaviours with an increasing risk of injury and metabolic cost was observed. Grasping was prolonged in males with larger fighting apparatus, who also tended to use more energy during the encounter than males displaying other behaviours. Our results indicate that the mandible size in C. newmannii serves as an honest signal of fighting ability in this species. Additionally, energetic assessments in preparation for fighting, costs during a fight, and persistence of metabolic costs post-fighting may be useful for understanding the relative fitness costs of competition.",

    "abstract": "The use of protective netting is becoming an increasingly popular practice in the citrus industry in South Africa. However, data on its effects on biotic factors, particularly insect pests, are limited. This study focused on the effect nets have on key citrus pests in the Eastern Cape province. Orchards under nets and open orchards, of similar cultivars, ages and management practices, were monitored at several sites over two seasons for pest infestation and damage. Weekly monitoring was conducted for Thaumatotibia leucotreta infestation. Other pests were monitored either monthly or once a season. During the first season, T. leucotreta infestation was higher in orchards under nets, probably because, unlike the open orchards, the nets provided protection for the existing high levels of T. leucotreta. No T. leucotreta infestation was recorded in both orchard types in 2019. This was due to generally lower than usual pest abundance and dramatically improved area-wide management of T. leucotreta. Pheromone traps were used to monitor T. leucotreta males, including sterile moths used in a sterile insect technique programme. Although higher catches of wild T. leucotreta moths were recorded in orchards under nets, so too were there higher numbers of sterile moths and a higher ratio of sterile to wild moths, indicating the potential for better pest suppression for orchards under nets. Various other key pests were monitored during this time, with variable results for each species. Pests that were elevated under nets include Planococcus citri and Aonidiella aurantii. Pests that seemed to be lower under nets were Ceratitis capitata and Scirtothrips aurantii. Nets had no effect on Empoasca distinguenda, Penthimiola bella and Eriophyes sheldoni. These differences in pest levels in netted and open orchards trigger an important debate on whether nets are beneficial for or detrimental to the successful implementation of an integrated pest management programme.",

Given its quarantine status in markets to which a large portion of the fresh produce is exported, its management in citrus orchards is essential. This management typically follows a systems approach in which baculovirus-based biopesticides, such as Cryptogran™ (Betabaculovirus cryleucotreta), are considered an important component of pre-harvest control strategies. It has previously been demonstrated that adding molasses with Cryptogran™ improves field performance, further reducing the number of T. leucotreta infested fruit. However, the reason for this improvement was never determined. This study aimed to understand the role that molasses may have on the behaviour of T. leucotreta first instars under laboratory conditions, leading to this improved field efficacy, and to confirm conclusively if the addition of molasses to the virus formulation improved efficacy across a further six field trials. In the laboratory, larvae exposed to molasses-treated oranges at either a concentration of 0.25% or 0.50% moved around the surface of the oranges less and also penetrated the oranges less compared to larvae exposed to non-molasses-treated oranges. This suggested that molasses, as a phagostimulant, encouraged larval feeding quicker and longer. This will promote the uptake of the biopesticide infective units and is likely the reason for the recorded improved field efficacy of Cryptogran™ when combined with molasses across all six field trials compared to its application alone. These two sets of experiments confirm conclusively that the addition of molasses to the virus formulation improves its efficacy and should be standard practice in the industry.",

Monitoring the changing species composition in this complex over a growing season provides valuable information for managing populations. In this study, pheromone traps were placed in two orchards planted with two different cultivars and used to monitor moth numbers over a 28-week period, while larval numbers and nut damage were monitored weekly over a 21-week period from the onset of flowering. Larvae were identified using a combination of morphology and DNA sequences of ~658 bp of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. Both larval and moth numbers were dominated by T. leucotreta, followed by T. batrachopa, with respective trap catches of 69% and 27%. Spearman correlations indicated strong linear relationships between nut diameter and numbers of eggs per nut for both the Beaumont and 816 cultivars. Poor correlations were found between weekly moth numbers and the number of eggs per nut. A two- to three-week lag was observed between weekly T. leucotreta trap catches and egg numbers. In contrast, egg numbers correlated strongly with larval infestation levels and the incidence of damaged nuts. Although the numbers of eggs and larvae were higher in Beaumont than cv. 816 nuts, higher incidences of nuts with husk and kernel damage were recorded for cv. 816. This study highlights the importance of monitoring of moth and larval numbers in macadamia orchards and showed that such data could be used to predict pest incidence during the season. This study questions the norm in South Africa, which is that macadamia nut borer (MNB) is usually the most abundant species in the nut borer complex.",

    "abstract": "The rate of human-induced spread of organisms is increasing with globalisation. In addition, climate change is altering ecosystems, enabling species to invade new environments. Invertebrates are particularly well-suited to invasion due to their generally small size and short generation time and their impacts can be extreme. Therefore, reliable species identification is a fundamental requirement for intercepting such alien organisms at borders and managing their populations, but traditional taxonomic identifications can be time-consuming and often require expertise. DNA barcoding is a molecular technique that is rapid, cost-effective and does not require taxonomic expertise. In this study, we compiled an updated checklist of all known alien invertebrate species in South Africa and their status on the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) using previous published records and literature. In total, 1013 alien invertebrate species, including 132 biocontrol agents, were found. Insects, predominantly hemipterans, comprised most of the alien species. Overall, 66.8% of alien species in the dataset were accessioned on BOLD. However, few of these alien invertebrate records were South African specimens (24.3%). This study marks the first comprehensive DNA barcoding checklist of alien and biocontrol agent invertebrates in South Africa. The findings are promising because many alien species can be identified to a Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit (MOTU) or Barcode Index Number (BIN) on BOLD using their COI barcode. However, there is a gap in available barcodes for alien invertebrates. As climate change alters the biogeography of alien species, baseline molecular data such as COI barcodes will be invaluable in monitoring and limiting their spread.",

For each species, habitat and climate preferences are described. Orius thripoborus was the only anthocorid natural enemy which was observed preying on the sugarcane thrips in the field.",

A discriminant function analysis yielded three morphoclusters: group 1 comprising an unnamed population at higher than 1500 m altitude in the mountains; group 2 consisting of bees considered to be A. m. scutellata x A. m. capensis hybrids, and group 3 consisting of A. m. scutellata surrounding the mountains at lower (less than 1500 m) altitudes. The bees of group 1 show size similarities to disjunct populations of other large Afromontane bees, A. m. monticola. Group 2 hybrid bees occur in an area of marked climatic variability and manifest significantly high variances in their morphometrics, pheromones and DNA characteristics. It is suggested that differences in swarming seasons among these populations effectively cause temporal reproductive isolation between the group 1 mountain bees and those A. m. scutellata below the escarpment.",

The fecundity and survival of H. variegata were investigated under ambient conditions in the laboratory. Eggs were laid in clutches of between 180 and 490 eggs per clutch, and took an average of 8.45 days to hatch. Hemijana variegata has five larval instars. The first-instar larvae are unable to feed on older leaves, thus survival of the larvae requires that hatching be synchronized with leaf emergence of the host plant in the field. The duration of the pupal stage varied between 32 days and more than 119 days. This wide variation may be an adaptation to annual climatic fluctuations such as years with no rain or late rainfall. This strategy might ensure their survival in areas where droughts are often experienced. The larvae had the highest mortality rate, followed by the pupae and then the eggs, with survivorship rates of 30.12 % (larvae), 63.98 % (pupae) and 98.67 % (eggs). Pupal survivorship could be higher, as 24 % of the pupae had not emerged after two years when the experiment was terminated.",

The weight loss and proximate composition (crude fibre, ash, protein, fat, carbohydrate, Na , K , Mg and Fe2 ) of the stored fish samples were analysed at the end of each period. The storage periods represented the treatments. Results revealed that the weight of experimental smoked fishes decreased as the storage duration increased. Similarly, the crude protein, ash and carbohydrate content of C. gariepinus decreased as the days of infestation increased (crude protein varied from 67.00 % at day 0 to 36.84 % at day 56). The mineral composition of the experimental fishes likewise decreased with days of infestation. Regression analysis showed a strong positive relationship between protein ( 0.95), fat ( 0.90), K ( 0.80) content of the fishes and duration of infestation. Thus, the nutritive quality of C. gariepinus is highly reduced by D. maculatus infestation.",

    "abstract": "The immobilisation of mosquitoes for injection experiments is a requirement that must be achieved for the necessary time duration to complete the process. Unfortunately, the use of cold anaesthesia in hot tropical countries is not very effective and the use of CO2 anaesthesia requires continuous exposure, which can be harmful to the experimenter. To circumvent this problem we evaluated the use of triethylamine (FlyNap) in the anaesthesia of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. FlyNap has been used widely in Drosophila studies, and is known to irreversibly anaesthetise mosquitoes. Very small volumes of the original FlyNap as well as different dilutions using absolute ethanol were evaluated to determine the dosage that will effectively anesthetise Anopheles gambiae female mosquitoes for the necessary duration. The results showed that the 1/10 (FlyNap/absolute ethanol) dilution worked well and could be used for the anaesthesia. Injecting live adults mosquitoes for scientific experiments is a delicate process that requires immobilising them for the required period of time. The immobilisation can be done using two main methods; chilling using cold anaesthesia (Garver & Dimopoulos 2007) or by chemical anaesthesia using CO2 (Lamacchia et al. 2013). In tropical climates cold anaesthesia is not very effective, and some mosquitoes can withstand some degree of chilling and hence may not be immobilised for long. Chemical anaesthesia, such as CO2 on the other hand, can result in the death of mosquitoes, and may be harmful to humans. A chemical anaesthesia commonly used is triethylamine. It is safe and poses no harmful effects to humans (Budavari 1989). Triethylamine formulated as FlyNap® (Carolina Biological Supply Co., NC, U.S.A.) is commonly available for anaesthetic purposes for insects. FlyNap is a mixture of 50 % triethylamine, 25 % ethanol and 25 % fragrance. It is 100 % volatile, water-soluble and can be stored in a cool, well-ventilated place. When exposed to FlyNap, insects are quickly incapacitated but remain alive and are unable to fly for several hours (Kramer et al. 1990). However, when in high doses, exposure causes death of the insect. It has been widely used in Drosophila anaesthesia (Paternostro et al. 2001; Babcock et al. 2008), and only used in lethal doses to kill mosquitoes (O’Guinn & Turell 2002; Goodman et al. 2003; Chen & Hillyer 2013). Our attempts to immobilise adult Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes using cold anaesthesia for injection experiments have proven unsuccessful, primarily due to the inability to immobilise mosquitoes long enough to complete the procedure. To circumvent this problem, this study aimed at evaluating the use of FlyNap and the dosage that will effectively anaesthetise An. gambiae long enough for experimental assays, and also result in high mosquito recovery rates. The experiment was conducted with 3and 5day-old Kisumu strain female An. gambiae mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were fed ad libitum on 10 % sucrose solution, following emergence. For each experiment, 10 mosquitoes were placed in a plastic cup and exposed to one of the following concentrations of FlyNap: 1 μl and 2 μl of stock, as well as 10 μl solutions of 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 dilutions of FlyNap. The dilutions were prepared with absolute ethanol. The FlyNap to be tested was aliquoted onto small cotton balls and placed in the cups with the mosquitoes. To evaluate the additional effect of the ethanol in anaesthetising the mosquitoes, a control experiment using 10 μl absolute ethanol only was included for the 3and 5-day-old mosquito groups. Each cup was turned upside down to ensure that the fumes from the FlyNap did not escape and could effectively knock down the mosquitoes. The time taken for the first mosquito to be knocked down was recorded for each experiment, and the number of mosquitoes knocked down was recorded at 10-min intervals. After all mosquitoes were knocked down, they were transferred to new cups. The time taken for the first mosquito to revive was noted, and the number of revived mosquitoes was subsequently recorded at 30-min intervals. All experiments were replicated three times to determine the average time of knock *Author for correspondence. E-mail: ddesouza@noguchi.ug.edu.gh",

The use of non-charged mixed ester filters under vacuum allows for the rapid processing of large volumes of water. Extracted DNA was utilised directly in PCR to amplify the baculovirus core gene polh/granulin. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus. Employing this technique, Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CrleGV)was detected in 15.4%of the water samples; 75%of the environmental swabs and 42.9%of the larvae despite measures to control baculovirus contamination in the facility. No baculovirus contamination was detected in food samples. This rapid and reproducible technique will facilitate rapid diagnosis of baculovirus infection in mass-rearing facilities and other water samples.",

Haematoporhyrin (HPF) was successful as a novel trend for S. pandurus control in the field due to its accumulation inside their organs after incubation and exposure to sunlight in the summer season. The survival rate of nymphs decreased with increasing HPF concentration. A concentration of 1× 10-3 M/l HPF increased the mortality of the first nymphal instar by 6.06- and 3.9-fold after 2 and 3 days as compared to the control, it produced the highest mortality that remained nearly constant throughout most of the 16 days of development. All biological parameters were affected, showing increased nymphal mortality, decreased number of deposited eggs by females and decreased percentage of egg hatchability. Light and electron microscopic studies on midgut regions (mg1-mg4) of adults resulting from treated nymphs revealed severe disorganisation and disintegration of cells and the presence of a great number of vacuoles. The basement membrane was detached. The microvilli were destroyed in the apical part and the food discharged. In addition, cell lysis appeared from mg1 to mg4 and many of cell organelles disappeared. The appearance of autophagic lysosomes was evident together with looped, vacuolated or swollen mitochondria. It seems likely that the nuclear membrane was ruptured or detached and clumping of the chromatin occurred. The muscle fibre and trachea were malformed. The obtained results might reflect the potency of HPF as a novel photoinsecticide in milkweed bug control in an integrated pest management (IPM) programme.",

These reserves are often small and the likelihood of interference competition between dominant and subordinate predators is increased, while the possibility of spatial avoidance is reduced. Given artificial space limitations, subordinate predators may reduce competitive interactions along niche axes other than habitat type such as time, coined a ‘management-induced niche shift’. We collected data on the activity patterns of male and female cheetahs using continuous follows and satellite GPS collars on two small, fenced reserves in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, one with lions (Panthera leo) and one without lions. There was a significant difference in the activity patterns of male and female cheetahs between the two reserves. In the presence of lions, nocturnal activity of cheetahs was greatly reduced, particularly for females. There was a corresponding increase in crepuscular activity for male cheetahs and diurnal activity for female cheetahs. In the context of other studies, our results suggest that space limitation affects cheetah response to lions and provides the first quazi-experimental evidence of a management-induced niche shift.",

Larvae, of which there are three instars, and pupae develop in the stem tissue. Adults feed on the leaves, and are found predominantly near the apices of plants. The larval stages were shown to be responsible for losses in cotton yield and diminished growth of cotton plants in general.

Samples were taken from beetles at rest, captured during flight of unknown length, collected immediately after voluntary termination of flight (without any traces of dung in the vicinity) and collected immediately upon arrival at pats of fresh cattle dung in the Sandveld Nature Reserve, Free State Province, South Africa. Resting beetles had high concentrations of proline in the haemolymph (approximately 145 μmol/ml) and flight muscles (approximately 70 μmol/g) but negligible concentrations of carbohydrates in the haemolymph (lower than 2 mg/ml) and glycogen in the flight muscles (approximately 0.1 μmol glucose equivalents/g). The beetles that were captured during flight, collected after they had terminated flight voluntarily or were trapped with fresh dung, had substantially lower proline levels in the haemolymph and flight muscles than resting beetles, while alanine levels in both compartments were significantly higher than in resting beetles. There were no differences in carbohydrate levels (in haemolymph and flight muscles) and lipid levels (haemolymph) between resting beetles and those that were active. From these results it was concluded that proline is the only energy substrate for flight in P.femoralis. Sufficient proline was available in the beetles each time it was measured. A lack of fuel is consequently not the reason for beetles to terminate flight.",

The leaf miner was detected in the three grape areas surveyed (Berg River, Hex River and Olifants River). Areas in the grape producing regions of the Western Cape that are heavily impacted by the leaf miner include Paarl, Riebeeck Kasteel, Tulbagh, Piketberg and Wellington.

This in turn demands up-to-date knowledge about the diversity of stemborers in natural habitats. The current list of known stemborers in South Africa includes 49 species associated with 65 wild host plant. The Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal biogeographic regions received little coverage in earlier studies. This study sought to fill this knowledge gap. We conducted surveys from 14 November 2014 to 18 March 2015 in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal biogeographic regions. Potential host plants in families Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Typhaceae were dissected in the field, stemborer life stages collected, reared on artificial diet, and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Thirty-three species belonging to Crambidae, Noctuidae, Phycitidae, Pyralidae and Tortricidae were recovered from 27 host plant species. Twenty-four species were recorded in Eastern Cape and 28 species in KwaZulu-Natal. The Chao 1 asymptotic species richness estimator predicted 3 and 5 more species for the biogeographic regions indicating an equitably complete species inventory of the study area. Fifteen species collected in this study are part of the existing inventory, and 19 are first records on the various host plants. The new records expand the list of stemborer species in South Africa from 49 to 68. The main factors influencing diversity were endemism, the number and disproportionate abundance of common and rare species.",

With the ability to live well in the environment of decomposition or waste containing a variety of substances, many types of microorganisms can be related to the intestinal microflora, helping the larvae digest, grow and develop well, even creating protection against parasites and pathogens. The present study aimed to identify the microbial community associated with larvae and determine the dominant species in their intestine. To understand the role of intestinal microflora of BSF larvae for partly explaining the excellent treatment and the ability to live well in the waste environment, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing methods were conducted in three parts of BSF larval intestine. The results indicated that the appearance of 11 dominant bands of larval intestinal microflora. Moreover, by using sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, our research has clearly classified seven specific strains of bacteria found in BSF larval intestine including Clostridium amazonese, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium tertium, Clostridium saccharolyticum, Actinomycetaceae, Dialister sp. and Dygonomonas. In particular, Clostridium is the most dominant genus compared to other groups and present in all three parts of larval intestine. The results obtained in this study provided insight into the bacterial community composition of black soldier fly larvae that can be used in the environmental, agricultural, and biomedical industries.",

    "abstract": "Cestrum (Solanaceae) species have become invasive in conservation and agricultural areas in South Africa, resulting in the initiation of a biological control (biocontrol) programme against these species in 2007. Of the four Cestrum species recorded in South Africa, Cestrum laevigatum Schltdl. and C. parqui L'Herit., which are both commonly referred to as inkberries, have become invasive while C. aurantiacum Lindl. and C. elegans (Brongn.) Schltdl. are still isolated at a few sites in the country. The biocontrol programme against Cestrum species (commonly called cestrum) was initially focussed on pathogens associated with these plants. Although the fungus Uromyces cestri Bertero ex Mont. (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae) was found to be a promising agent for cestrum, the pathogen project was shelved due to lack of capacity. Field surveys conducted in Argentina from 2012 to 2020 revealed a total of eight phytophagous insects that could be candidate agents. Among these is a leaf-feeding flea beetle Epitrix sp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) that has been tested for host specificity. Out of 47 plant species tested to date, Epitrix sp. has only fed and developed on three Cestrum species, suggesting that it is suitable for release against cestrum in South Africa. Permission to release Epitrix sp. will be sought once it has been identified to the species level or it has been described as a new species. Two chrysomelid beetle species, a root-feeding flea beetle (Diphaulaca sp.) and an unidentified leaf-feeding flea beetle, were also collected on C. parqui, but attempts to rear the former were unsuccessful. Three other leaf-miners collected from C. parqui include: Acrocercops leucographa Clark (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), an unidentified moth (Lepidoptera: Argyresthiidae) and Liriomyza sp. nr. schlingerii (Diptera: Agromyzidae). A glass-winged butterfly (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was the only herbivore that may be of biocontrol value on C. laevigatum. Whilst it is essential to extend the surveys to other regions of the native range, it is also important to prioritize the most promising potential biocontrol agents for further testing in South Africa. Given the suite of potential biocontrol agents in the native range, there are good prospects for the biocontrol of cestrum species in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "The eucalyptus snout beetle, Gonipterus scutellatus (Gyllenhal), introduced to South Africa from Australia, causes extensive damage to eucalyptus plantations in colder regions where biological control is less effective. A cytogenetic study was undertaken to assess the weevil's genetic recombination potential and thereby its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. During this study we investigated: (i) the sequence of meiosis; (ii) the weevil's karyotype; and (iii) the number and position of chiasmata on the bivalents. Squashes of male testes revealed a normal, chiasmate meiosis, a sex chromosome complement of Xyp and an autosome complement of three large, and two medium-sized, sub-metacentric pairs and seven small acrocentric pairs. The diploid chromosome number (2n = 26) is marginally higher than the ancestral chromosome number of the Curculionidae (2n = 22). Chiasmata were absent from the proximal regions of the bivalents, occurring mostly in the distal regions and less frequently in the interstitial regions. The mean of 15 chiasmata per cell was marginally higher than the number of bivalents (13); consequently, acrocentric and most sub-metacentric chromosomes displayed a single distal chiasma, while 2–3 sub-metacentrics also displayed a second distal or interstitial chiasma. The relatively low chromosome number and low frequency of chiasmata indicate that genetic recombination is controlled at independent assortment and crossing-over. This may limit the potential of G. scutellatus to proliferate under changing conditions and increase its pest status in the future.",

    "abstract": "Soil arthropods cause kernel and pod damage and can lower yields of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) in Ghana, West Africa. On-station and on-farm experiments were conducted during 2007 and 2008 at Kwadaso and Hiawoannwu, respectively, using an improved peanut cultivar/line RRR-ICGU 88709 in a soil arthropod pests management trial. The trial included four treatments, i.e. chlorpyrifos (Dursban™) insecticide as a standard, three levels of granulated sugar as baits, and an untreated control. Soil arthropod pests observed in peanut plots during both years from the two locations were white grubs, millipedes, symphilids, termites, earwigs, and red ants while predators included centipedes and black ants. Termites and red ants were the predominant arthropod pests and predatory black ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) exceeded that of centipedes (Myriapoda: Chilopoda) in the two trial locations. The proportion of unfilled pods was high in the two locations during both years. Generally, the population of centipedes was lower than that of black ants. Damage caused by arthropods to pods or kernels in the sugar-baited plots across the two locations were low and differed significantly from the non-baited plots. Chlorpyrifos-treated plots recorded the highest yield followed by the high rate of sugar baits and the lowest yield being the low rate of sugar among the treatment plots. Data generated in this study have shown that sugar-baits may be effective in suppressing pest populations of peanut and may provide a better refuge for the natural enemies and could be recommended as an option for pest management in peanut production.",

Modern area selection techniques are critically dependent especially on distribution data, yet for poorly surveyed taxa, such as invertebrates, these are often not available. In this paper we bring together gradsect biological survey methods and protected area selection algorithms to address this problem. We present an approach which places survey routes, based on the gradsect survey design method of spanning maximum environmental gradients, in areas poorly or completely unsurveyed/sampled. This 'record absence gradient selection' technique can be used to plan further efficient and effective field surveys for the collection of distribution data for inadequately sampled taxa. This method is not intended as a replacement for distribution modelling techniques, but rather as an addition to the toolbox used by conservation planners.",

This represents the first description of the immature stages of an Afrotropical species of Odiniidae, the first using SEM techniques, and the first record of an association with Acacia. Biology is discussed, with the minimum period of larval development determined as 39–46 days and the puparial stage as 17–22 days. The immature stages of 12 species of Odiniidae are known and these are reviewed. The puparium of Afrodinia is most similar to that of the genus Odinia Robineau-Desvoidy, supporting the inclusion of Afrodinia in the Odiniinae. Functional morphology of the hooked spinules on the ventral creeping welts and development of subanal pads on the anal division of the larva are discussed. It is suggested that these structures aid both anchorage and mobility of larvae within the smoothly bored tunnels in which they largely reside. There is an apparent correlation between the greater size of subanal pads and a reduction in the size and extent of spinules on creeping welts.",

In fact, their biotic and abiotic interactions, ranging from simple through to complex and sophisticated, have provided models on which many ecological principles are based. All this has also been the reason why numerous textbooks specifically dedicated to insect ecology (e.g. Price 1997; Speight et al. 1999; Schowalter 2000) have been produced over the years, thereby elevating insect ecology as a distinct science.",

Gut physiology was represented by a sophisticated study of membrane potential in the springtail, the gut as a point of infection for Sindbis virus in mosquito, and a study of the gut transcriptome and proteome of a coleopteran storage pest. A study of chemical ecology described methods currently being used in Kenya to control locust damage to crops. These presentations provided unique perspectives of insect nutrition and gut physiology as related to insect control or improved understanding of beneficial insects.",

One of the aims of the programme was to determine whether sufficient protection could be achieved to reduce malaria transmission. We report on the relevant entomological aspects before and after intervention. The study was conducted in an area with high malaria transmission, with estimated entomological inoculation rates (EIR) of 300 infective bites per person per annum. After two and a half years of using IMNs, mosquito densities were not affected but there was a significant reduction in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) sporozoite rates. This led to a reduction of the EIR by 76 % in intervention villages and is mainly due to individual protection. Reduction in EIR was 86 % for Anopheles funestus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) compared to 66 % for An.gambiae s.l.Giles (P <0.001). However, unprotected communities are still at risk from malaria. To realize optimum community protection against malaria, extra effort should be made to maximize net coverage in the community, encourage net use throughout the year and ensure regular and timely re-impregnation of mosquito nets.",

    "abstract": "Chnootriba similis Thunberg (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a sporadic pest that often causes extensive defoliation of wheat and other crops during outbreaks in many parts of Africa. Both the larvae and the adults cause characteristic perforations of foliage and can be present in large numbers over a wide area (Graham 1953). Where infestation is severe, growth and ear formation in wheat or barley are completely arrested. The beetles are widely distributed in Africa south of the Sahara and parts of Yemen (Anon. 1994). In West Africa, the beetles have specialized in defoliation of rice crops (Taylor & Kamara 1974), while in Ethiopia the beetles are sometimes called tef beetles and are found on wheat and barley crops in wet land and dry land habitats. These beetles are also considered major pests of pearl millet, Pennisetum t yphoides Burm., i n t he S udan (Schmutter 1969). In East Africa the beetles can attack a range of graminaceous plants including pastures, maize, rice, barley and wheat (Le Pelley 1952). The pest occurs in Kenya mainly in two endemic habitats: Naru-Moru marshland and along Malewa river towards Lake Naivasha. These areas are adjacent to the low rainfall zones that are currently developed by the government for expansive wheat production. At the moment the scenario presents a great risk for the wheat crop. Information on yield losses associated with these beetles is yet to be developed, especially on wheat. The beetles affect wheat grain yield indirectly by feeding on plant leaves especially the flag leaf (last leaf) (growth stages according to Zadoks, et al. 1974) prior to ear formation. The beetle density that can cause economic injury to the wheat crop has not been studied. The aims of this study were to determine the critical infestation level that can result in a significant yield reduction and the most susceptible growth stage in wheat. The beetles used in the test were laboratoryreared on a grass host, Digitaria scalarum (Schweinf.) Chiov., from the first instar to pupation. Emergent",

    "abstract": "During routine mass rearing of Culex pipiens L., 46 % mortality rate was recorded among 3-day-old larvae in the late summer, 2014, at Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. An analysis of the water in the rearing plastic cups and the dead larvae revealed the presence of the fungus Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson. A comparative study was carried out using life-table parameters of the fungal-infected population of Cx. pipiens and fungus-free population (control) under laboratory conditions (30 ± 0.10 °C, RH 52.5 ± 7.8 % and photoperiod 16L:8D). Fungal-infected stages of Cx. pipiens exhibited a decrease in longevity (larvae, 5.89 ± 0.063 days; adult males, 7.8 ± 0.75 days; adult females, 10.83 ± 1.6 days). The mean generation time of the healthy population (22.09 ± 0.82 days) was not significantly different from that of the infected population (22.25 ± 0.08 days), nearly the same mean generation time. The fungal-infected Cx. pipiens population replicated itself 4.62 ± 1.45 times with a very low exponential rate of daily increase of 0.0688 ± 0.0154/day. However, the fungus-free population showed a higher replication rate of 38.10 ± 11.80 times, with a higher daily rate of increase (0.1648 ± 0.0167/day). Females of the fungal-infected Cx. pipiens, exhibited a decrease in the fertility, 25.67 ± 7.70 eggs/female, as compared to the females from the control population, 163.29 ± 40.64 eggs/female. Data of the present study suggested the possibility of using N. rileyi as a safe bio-control agent against the development of the larvae of Cx. pipiens.",

Although the recorded distribution of Henicovalva gen. n. is disjunct, this may be due to sampling bias. The phylogenetic position of the new genus within Ennominae is discussed, and it is tentatively placed in Ennomini. Illustrations of the adults and male and female genitalia, where known, are provided, as is a map showing the distribution of the southern African species. The study is complemented by a Gazetteer.",

PDVs have double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes that are segmented, with up to 30 circular dsDNAs reported (Espagne et al. 2004; Kroemer & Webb 2004; Pennacchio & Strand 2006). The PDVs of both ichneumonids (ichnoviruses) and braconids (bracoviruses) occur as proviruses integrated in the wasp genome, with replication and virus particle production occurring only in the wasp ovaries in a region called the calyx (Fleming 1992; Albrecht et al. 1994; Strand & Pech 1995). A very high number of virus particles (containing circular episomal forms of the integrated DNA genome) are released (by cell rupture in braconids) or secreted (by ichneumonids) from the calyx cells into the oviducts and during oviposition the PDVs are injected with the eggs and ovarian fluid into the host larvae (Stoltz & Vinson 1979; Fleming 1992; Dupuy et al. 2006). Although there is no PDV replication in the wasp's host, PDV gene expression in the host disrupts the host's development and cellular defence systems thus allowing the wasp's progeny to survive and complete their development (Strand & Pech 1995; Webb 1998; Pennacchio & Strand 2006; Webb et al. 2006).",

To investigate the species and number of arthropods using a needle-point sampler, each pot had 1 kg of grain sampled from both the upper layer (0–35 cm) and the lower layer (35–70 cm) every 15 days. The results showed 12 species of arthropods including Corrodentia, Acarina, Chelonethida, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were found. No significant differences were observed in the community structure parameters of the arthropods between transgenic Bt rice and non-Bt rice. In both rice varieties, Liposcelis bostrychophilus exhibited the highest level of abundance of community structure, followed by Rhizopertha dominica and Tyrophagus putrescentiae. Overall, there was no significant difference in the temporal dominance curve profiles of the three dominant arthropods between Bt and non-Bt rice.

    "abstract": "As parasitoid development is dependent on resources provided by a single host, the quality and quantity of resources its herbivore host obtains from different host plants can influence parasitoid fitness. Laboratory studies were conducted on several fitness parameters (developmental time, pupal weights, longevity, fecundity and sex ratio of progeny) of a larval parasitoid Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) when its host Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) developed on seven cabbage cultivars. In addition, population increase parameters of the parasitoid were compared on the various cultivars. The generation time of the parasitoid was shortest on Karabo (10.10 days) and Leano (10.38 days), and longest on Megaton (12.57 days) and Empowa (12.80 days). The heaviest C. vestalis pupae were recorded from Menzania (5.4 mg), Megaton (5.25 mg) and Beverly Hills (4.85 mg) and the lightest on Karabo (3.8 mg). Parasitoids reared on larvae that fed on Hollywood F1 lived the longest (2.28 days) followed by Menzania (1.94 days) and Beverly Hills (1.8 days), whereas those whose hosts fed on Leano lived the shortest period (0.83 days). Despite the parasitoids from Megaton hosts being bigger, their fecundity and number of female progeny per female (16.87 and 3.60, respectively) were lowest. Cotesia vestalis fecundity and daughters produced per female were highest on hosts fed on Menzania (38.00 and 9.13, respectively) and Beverly Hills (32.87 and 9.07, respectively). As a consequence, the net reproductive rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of increase (r) were higher on Menzania (7.87 and 0.58, respectively) and Beverly Hills (8.29 and 0.62, respectively). Not only do these results suggest that the overall fitness of C. vestalis is higher on hosts developing on Menzania and Beverly Hills, the critical density of the parasitoid required to suppress the host population at a lower average density will be reached quicker on these two cultivars than on others.",

Two concentrations, namely LC50 and LC80, were tested. Studied parameters included bacterial exposure time and mosquito larval density. Exposure time periods were 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h. Larval density varied by exposing different numbers of larvae yielding larval density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 larva/ml. Larval density also varied by exposing 20 larvae in different water volumes yielding larval density of 0.8, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1 larva/ml. Strain B1-634BNI was the most active (LC50 = 0.02 ppm) among the tested strains. Mortality rates of larvae varied at different exposure periods and with the different larval densities. Mortality rates of Cx. pipiens larvae increased with the increase of the exposure period of the larvae to the bacterial suspension of strain B1-634BNI either at its LC50 or LC80. As larval density increased, mortality rates of larvae decreased when treated with each of the three tested bacterial strains whether at its LC50 or LC80. Adjusting bacterial application in control programmes according to those elements is thus indispensable to ensure a satisfactory result.",

Taxonomic uncertainty exists in South Africa with this group and represents an impediment to the development and implementation of pheromone-based management tactics. Populations from the Western Cape have been described as Nudaurelia cytherea while those from KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga have been described as Nudaurelia clarki. We compared Cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences from moths from the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Mpumalanga regions. We also analysed female pheromone gland extracts with gas-chromatography electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for moths from KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. COI gene barcoding sequences were identical for moths from the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Mpumalanga regions providing preliminary evidence to suggest that these populations may be the same species. Based on the available literature, the morphology and origin of our samples suggests that pheromone analyses in this study were done on N. clarki. Male N. clarki antennae respond to two compounds in female extracts. One of these compounds was confirmed with a synthetic standard to be (Z)-dec-5-en-1-yl-3-methylbutanoate, the sex pheromone previously identified from N. cytherea. The identity of the second compound could not be confirmed. Both male and female antennae responded to four structurally related compounds in the synthetic pheromone standard. Field trials with custom-made traps confirmed attraction of N. clarki males to polydimethylsiloxane and polyisoprene lures loaded with synthetic (Z)-dec-5-en-1-yl-3-methylbutanoate.",

Many countries exempt these devices from regulatory requirements, but not South Africa. The question arises whether the pheromone/semiochemical lures influence the naturally occurring compounds significantly, to justify concern for human toxicity and ecotoxicity. T.V. PheroLure® is a novel five-component lure developed by Insect Science (Pty) Ltd. used for monitoring African bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (an important insect pest on tomatoes). T.V. PheroLure® is a volatile organic compound (VOC) blend impregnated in a polyethylene bulb. The influence of T.V. PheroLure® on the volatile profile of a tomato field was evaluated in a commercial growing area of South Africa. Tomato VOCs were collected before, during and after the application of six T.V. PheroLures® in yellow bucket funnel traps randomly distributed over 1 ha. VOCs were collected from planting until harvest (22 weeks) at five randomly selected sites. Collection also took place in adjacent tomato fields where no T.V. PheroLure® was applied. The constituents of T.V. PheroLure® had no significant influence on the naturally occurring VOCs observed in the tomato field. The results suggest that the concern for toxicity and ecotoxicity is unjustified when using semiochemical devices for monitoring purposes. The natural physiology of the plant, rather than T.V. PheroLure®, influenced the VOCs observed in a tomato field.",

    "abstract": "The larvae of the copper-tailed blowfly (Chrysomya chloropyga) have the potential to break down high-risk waste such as abattoir waste and ameliorate the nutrients to be reintroduced into the food chain by including them in broiler feeds. Chrysomya chloropyga larvae were grown on abattoir waste, harvested, processed, and included in broiler diets at inclusion rates of either 5, 10 or 15%. Thereafter the carcass traits, meat quality characteristics and descriptive sensory attributes were determined. Further to this the mineral content of the tibia, as well as the tibia bone strength were determined. The highest inclusion rate of 15% resulted in broiler carcass and meat characteristics that were on par with a formulated soya-based control diet. The chemical composition of the meat was predominantly not significantly affected by the dietary larval meal inclusion (p &gt; 0.05). In terms of its sensory attributes, meat from broilers fed C. chloropyga meal showed some significant differences for chicken aroma and initial juiciness (p ≤ 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed for any of five other sensory attributes of importance. Interestingly, the dietary inclusion of C. chloropyga meal was significantly related to increased tibia potassium and iron content, which could be linked to the insects’ accumulating these minerals present in the abattoir waste. The results indicate that C. chloropyga larval meal could be included in broiler diets at up to 15% without any negative effects on the aforementioned characteristics and could even influence them positively.",

This long-awaited guide to an important and ubiquitous faunal group will not only be a valuable reference for serious lepidopterists, but also a valuable tool to enable the ever growing band of citizen scientists and conservationists to become more familiar with their subjects. It is written for the most part in plain language, whilst also exposing the reader to terms used by experts to describe moths and their caterpillars, thus also having an educational purpose. The adult photographs are of moths in the wild, in contrast to earlier publications, which were of museum specimens.",

Hybrid 511 and ICZ3 maize plants were infested with blackhead stage egg batches of C. partellus three weeks after crop emergence. Neem seed powder, neem seed powder-sawdust mixture and a 10 % aqueous neem seed extract were applied four weeks after crop emergence. Dipterex was used as a check treatment and plots with untreated plants were included as controls. Foliar application of neem seed products and chemical insecticide considerably suppressed the densities of C. partellus, markedly reduced leaf damage and stem-tunnelling, and improved yield in both cultivars. Application of about 3 g plant/neem seed powder and 500 l/ha of 10 % aqueous neem seed extract applied four weeks after crop emergence provide adequate protection against damage by C. partellus comparable to conventional insecticide and avert consequent yield loss.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on Culex pipiens pipiens mosquitoes collected from Tunisia between 1990 and 1996 revealed an alarming resistance to organophosphate insecticides. However, since then very few studies have assessed the evolution of insecticides resistance in this species of mosquitoes. Three populations of Cx. pipiens pipiens mosquitoes were collected in three districts across the country between 2003 and 2005 and subjected to evaluation of their fenitrothion resistance/susceptibility status and associated mechanisms. Studied populations showed moderate resistance to the used insecticide which ranged from 7.59 to 11.8. The use of synergists revealed the lack of detoxification enzymes as metabolic resistance. However, starch gel electrophoresis indicated that resistance at the Ester locus was attributed to different Ester alleles. On the other hand, the positive cross-resistance to organophosphate fenitrothion and carbamate propoxur insecticides indicating a high prevalence of insensitive AChE1 mechanism in field populations. AChE activity showed that all populations exhibited a significant excess of heterozygotes ([RS]) compared to other detected genotypes ([SS] and [RR]) in the studied samples. Our analysis suggests that the heterozygotes often have a fitness advantage over the homozygotes.",

    "abstract": "Among insects, the melanisation immune response is an important part of their innate immunity. Current research has provided evidence that insects regulate their melanisation immune response via the activities of inhibitors, such as the serine protease inhibitors. However, as the key substrate of the melanisation process, it is plausible that dopamine may also play a role in regulating the strength of the melanisation immune response. To address this hypothesis, a novel transgenic RNAi-inhibited gene system was developed to suppress dopamine catabolism in the model lepidopteran insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori, and later challenged the resulting transgenic insects with the bacterium Escherichia coli. Furthermore, comparisons were made on the expression levels of dopamine related genes amongst the transgenic and wild type silkworms in two of the major insect immune tissues, fat body and haemolymph, using real-time PCR and Semi-quantitative PCR. Results from this study showed that when E. coli germsolution was injected into the silkworms, the concentration of dopamine was markedly increased in the transgenic compared with the wild type group. The expression of genes BmTH and BmDDC, which are involved in the anabolism of dopamine was suppressed while the expression of genes BmEbony and Bm-iAANATs, which are involved in dopamine catabolism was elevated in transgenic silkworms injected with E. coli. These findings suggest that dopamine may play an important role in regulating the strength of the melanisation immune response. Therefore this study contributes to the current knowledge of melanisation immune response in insects.",

Five dose levels (10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 μg/larva) of methoprene was topically applied onto the early last instar larvae and prepupae. The adult emergence of flies was completely blocked at the highest dose, regardless of the time of treatment. At other dose levels, the adult eclosion was partially blocked. Survival of the adult flies was adversely affected by the toxic potency of methoprene. Only at doses of 5.0 and 1.0 μg/larva, some morphologically deformed flies were observed. The total longevity of adult females was remarkably shortened in a dose-dependent course. Topical application of methoprene onto either last instar larvae or prepupae resulted in a considerably prolonged pre-larviposition period, but significantly shortened larviposition period. Topical treatment of either last instar larvae or prepupae with methoprene led to dramatic reduction in natality, in a dose-dependent course.",

Gathering intra-plant distribution and population fluctuation data could contribute to developing more efficient sampling methods for R. indica. Taking this into consideration, studies were carried out to determine spatial temporal distribution of R. indica in three commercial plantations in the state of Falcón, in Venezuela. Higher mite numbers were registered on middle and lower leaf portions collected from middle or lower plant strata, suggesting that sampling should be allocated to these canopy areas on coconut trees. The R. indica population showed to be negatively associated with rainfall. In 2010, population levels of R. indica were higher than in 2011 (maximum 7 mites/cm2); this was probably a function of lower rainfall values for that year. In 2011, the highest population levels were reached between April and July, coinciding with the lowest rainfall values over that year. Relating to this population spike, the Amblyseius largoensis population showed a numerical response in relation to R. indica density; this predator species does not appear to be exerting bio-control on the mite pest population.",

Gamma radiation induced a significant effect on the reproductive potential of M. domestica through the first three generations, where the sterility index was higher than those of the untreated control, especially in F1 and F2 generations. The great inherited deleterious effects occurred when IM × IF and when IM × UIF indicating that the male of M. domestica is more radiosensitive than the female. The electrophoretic separation of protein bands in the third larval instar of M. domestica resulted from different matings (irradiated and unirradiated males and females) vs control was investigated in the present study. The control larvae recorded the highest number of protein bands (27), while the larvae resulted from crossing of UIF × IM (LD50 = 5 Gy) contained the lowest number of protein bands (14). However, the number of protein bands in larvae resulted from crossing of IF × UIM (LD50 = 7 Gy) was 24 bands also the number of bands resulted from crossing IF × IM (LD50 = 4 Gy) was 21 bands. In addition, the results showed that the type of mating affects the distribution of protein bands, where some protein bands appeared and others disappeared in third larval instar resulted from the different irradiated and unirradiated males and females. These results may indicate that males of M. domestica are more radio sensitive than females where the lowest number of bands was separated in larvae resulted from IM × UIF. Consequently, these radiation doses are recommended for the establishment of Male Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) programmes against M. domestica.",

    "abstract": "Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. is an important food crop adaptable to a broad range of agro-ecological conditions. The knowledge of the performance of the available varieties under a specific ecological condition is important to improve the production. A field experiment was carried out at the University of Ghana farm during the major and minor rainy seasons of 2015 to determine the yield performance of seven improved Ghanaian sweet potato varieties (CRI-Apomuden, CRI-Ligri, Faara, CRI-Bohye, CRI-Dadanyuie, Okumkom, Sauti) and their susceptibility to the sweet potato weevil, Cylas spp. (Coleoptera: Brentidae). Significant difference was found in the storage root yield among the varieties, with CRI-Ligri having the highest in both major (23.11 t/ha) and minor (22.49 t/ha) rainy seasons. CRI-Apomuden and CRI-Ligri scored the highest levels of infestation by sweet potato weevil in the major and minor seasons (1.94 and 2.00, 1.84 and 1.96, respectively) and yield loss (44.44 % and 42.80 %, 23.84 % and 23.87 %, respectively). While the lowest infestation levels in the major rainy season were recorded on Faara and Okumkom (1.18 and 1.31, respectively) with yield losses of 10.32 % and 9.09 %, respectively. However, in the minor rainy season, there was no significant difference among Faraa, Okumkom, CRI-Bohye and CRI-Dadanyuie in terms of infestation level and yield losses. Significant difference was found in all measured root characteristics including the shortest weevil distance, root neck length, root length, root girth and root size index. The storage root infestation had a strong negative correlation with the shortest weevil distance, a strong positive correlation with the root size index and a weak negative correlation with root neck length. In this study, Okumkom appeared to be less susceptible to sweet potato weevil infestation with relatively acceptable yield performance and therefore can be recommended for use by farmers to improve sweet potato production.",

    "abstract": "The peach fruit fly (PFF), Bactrocera zonata (Saunders), is a serious, multivoltine and polyphagous insect pest that infests fruits directly, causing a serious damage. Increasing incidence of insecticide resistance has led to a renewed interest in developing insecticides with alternative modes of action, lower environmental impact and greater compatibility with integrated pest management (IPM) programmes. Accordingly, a selection of crude extracts (CEs) and essential oils (EOs) of eucalyptus, jojoba, lavender, neem was screened against the PFF and their effects on some biological aspects were studied. Incubation periods of EOs at the used concentrations were lower than that of CEs. The egg hatchability in case of CEs was significantly affected compared to EOs. The average numbers of pupae collected differed significantly according to both CEs and EOs of the tested four plants. In respect of the CEs, the formed pupae of treated individuals were significantly lower than that of the untreated ones. EOs of lavender inhibit pupal formation of B. zonata more strongly than the EOs from the other tested botanicals. The average number of emerged adults of CEs- or EOs-treated larval artificial diets were highly significantly lower than that of the control. The differences between averages of emerged adults of CEs of the four tested botanicals were significant. Neem crude extract was the most potent, showing the lowest average of emerged adults of B. zonata. The differences between averages of malformed adults resulted in both CEs- and EOs-treated larval diets were statistically non-significant. Based on these results, EOs were more effective than CEs of the used plants against the PFF.",

In the present study, we have isolated eight full-length MLEs from the tomato leaf miner by PCR amplification, using a single primer designed from the ITR of Hyalophora cecropia L. Mariner signature sequence D,D(34)D, as well as the conserved amino acid motifs, WVPHEL and YSPDLAP(T)D, were identified. However, sequences analysis revealed defective elements with the presence of several kinds of mutations generating stop codons, frameshifts, and non-functional transposase. Based on predicted transposase sequences, T. absoluta MLEs (Tamar1) belongs to the cecropia subfamily and clustered closely with MLEs from other Lepidoptera members suggesting vertical genetic transmission from a common ancestor. The identification of mariner-like elements in this invasive species will be useful to understand the genome dynamics in Lepidoptera.",

The Egyptian cockroaches of the family Ectobiidae (Blattodea) are reviewed. Five species in five genera are recognised, including Blattella germanica, Chorisia reducta, Phyllodromica nilotica, Supella longipalpa and Matabeli natreitlina. Gene sequence of 28s ribosomal RNA is provided for Chorisia reducta (Walker) for the first time. The PCR product was found to be about 512 bp long, after sequencing this result aligned with the GenBank data then constructing the phylogenetic tree by using Mega 0.6 program. Colour images, specimens examined and distributions are given for each species.",

Here, we focus on Antanartia borbonica (Oberthür, 1880), a threatened Mascarene butterfly, extinct from Mauritius and considered locally endangered (EN) on Réunion by the French IUCN committee. On Réunion, we investigated the way A. borbonica distribution changes throughout the year depending on elevation and temperature. We confirm previous observations suggesting a seasonal displacement along the elevational gradient: A. borbonica spends the winter in low-elevation areas and moves to higher ones during summer. This biological trait implies conservation actions considering the restoration of suitable habitats for this species along the elevational gradient. The priority, to ensure the long-term conservation of this species, is to create refuges especially in urban and secondary habitats located in lowland areas where relatively preserved ecosystems no longer exist.",

Whenever we study a pest, we are presented with an opportunity to enhance, rather than merely apply, knowledge. It is argued that pest management research is currently failing itself because it is not doing this, and several areas of theoretical biology are identified as offering ways out of this situation.",

The unit consists of frame structure, spray tank, horizontal triplex pump, control valves, spray gun nozzle, pressure gauge, strainer, hydraulic agitator and actuating mechanism. The power to drive the HTP pump was taken from the tractor power take off (PTO) through a belt and pulley. The actuating mechanism consists of motor and worm gear reduction. Two motors with 0.5 kW each (12 V dc) were used to provide oscillation motion to spray guns and motors get power from the tractor battery. The rotation angle of the spray gun is 30° horizontally. Provision was also made to fold the spray boom while in transport. The spray pattern could be adjusted based on the application of chemicals. This study was conducted to determine the suitable nozzle orientation (0, 15 and 30° downwards) to field crops. The orientation of the spray nozzle was maintained by using the metal protractor. The laboratory experiments were carried out by using the actual cotton plant. The best nozzle orientation for maximum droplet density and droplet size as 15° downward. Leaf hopper [Amrasca biguttula (Ishida)] and aphids [Aphis gossypii (Glover)] control in the cotton crop after 7th day of spraying dinotefuran insecticide from the automatic gun sprayer and conventional tractor-operated gun sprayer was 87, 86 and 58 %, and 50 %, respectively. The total cost required to fabricate the sprayer was US$ 1008. The cost of operation of the tractor operated automatic gun sprayer was found to be US$ 4.7/ ha.",

Beekeepers in the Tizi-Ouzou wilaya (Algeria) where the imidacloprid insecticide is used, report unusual losses and deaths of bee colonies. Even at sublethal doses, insecticid can impact the most crucial tasks of a bee colony such as comb building. This study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of an imidacloprid based insecticide (Confidor®Supra) on the production of wax by the honeybee Apis mellifera intermissa. After the imidacloprid LD50 was determined in controlled conditions, three sublethal doses were tested. The mortality, the syrup consumption and the weight of the wax generated were recorded.&#x0D; The imidacloprid insecticide LD50 at 48 hours was evaluated at 3.5 ng.per bee on 4 days old spring worker bees. We found that the three sublethal doses (0.175 mg.L-1, 0.087 mg.L-1 and 0.035 mg.L-1) had an impact on the syrup consumption and the wax production by adult bees. Bees exposed to sublethal doses of insecticide consumed less syrup and produced less wax that the control bees. A dose response was observed regarding the production of wax.&#x0D; The reduction of wax production by bees caused by an exposure to an imidacloprid based insecticide ads up to the many other effects of imidacloprid described in the literature. This kind of impact could have harmful consequences for bee colonies as wax production is the basis of nest building. The physiological causes of the reduction of wax production remain to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "High trait variability among insects reflects a combination of intra- and inter-phenotype variations. Our aim was to assess if the trait distribution of body measurements can be more significantly influenced by sex (intraspecific variance) or by species (interspecific variance). To achieve this, we collected in Namibia tettigoniids belonging to two congeneric species of armoured ground crickets: Acanthoplus discoidalis (a significant pest in African croplands) and the long-legged Acanthoplus longipes. We measured in the field the total body length, the maximal pronotal width and length, and the femur and tibia lengths of the hind legs in 106 adults. We also derived the body mass from length and width values of the sampled specimens. No significant differences emerged in the two species by sex. A discriminant analysis clearly shows that at species level the locomotory traits as captured by tibia and femur lengths and the size traits as captured by body and pronotal lengths account for 99 % of the total variance and clearly separate this pest from its congeneric species. In essence, it is not primarily the body size that differentiates the two species, but rather the pronotum and hind leg larger sizes of A. longipes. Different eco-ethological requirements, like the peculiarity of the calling song and the movements within the vegetation (and the consequently needed energy), independently force these functional traits.",

    "abstract": "Stored-product pests attack cereal grains and legume seeds post-harvest. They not only damage the grain but also decrease its weight and quality. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the bioactivity of resin powders extracted from Pistacia lentiscus L. bark, Boswellia carterii birdwood bark, and Elettaria cardamomum seeds against two of the most important stored-product pests, Sitophilus granarius (L.) and Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val. We used three bioassay methods, repellent effect, reduction of progeny, and grain weight loss and investigated the effects of the powders on the life cycles of the insects. Wheat grains were mixed with the three botanical powders separately, at different concentrations (3, 5, 7, and 10 % w/w). Sitophilus granarius and T. confusum were fed these mixtures. Repellent activity was examined after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. The E. cardamomum powder displayed the maximum repellent activity (100 %) against both S. granarius and T. confusum after 24 h at 3 % concentration. The P. lentiscus powder reached maximum repellent activity (80 %) against S. granarius and T. confusum at 7 % concentration after 12 h and 24 h, respectively. The B. carterii powder achieved maximum repellent activity against S. granarius and T. confusum (73.3 % and 86.7 %) at 10 % concentration after 24 h and 12 h, respectively. No progeny was produced in grains treated with 3 % P. lentiscus powder, 7 % E. cardamomum powder, or 7 % B. carterii powder. Thus, protection against both beetles started from 3 % concentration when P. lentiscus powder was used and from 7 % and 10 % (against S. granarius and T. confusum, respectively) when E. cardamomum powder was used. A 7 % B. carterii concentration completely saved the grains from S. granarius damage, and a 10 % concentration offered 99.5 % protection against T. confusum. However, all tested powders significantly affected all the studied parameters (life cycle and grain weight loss). The results show that the three botanical powders provide high repellent activity against S. granarius and T. confusum, which might be useful in protecting stored grains from these insects.",

    "abstract": "Thrips is a harmful cosmopolitan polyphagous pest with marked serious and adverse effects on over 200 host plants, it infests tomatoes, sucking and destroying its seedlings. This study was carried out in a Rogina tomato hybrid field in three governorates, El-Beheira, El-Faiyum and El-Sharqia, in Egypt. In order to evaluate the efficacy of five predatory mites (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) namely; Typhlodrompis swirskii, Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus cucumeris, Typhlodromus nigavi and Neoseiulus californicus as well as the recommended combination (abamectin + Egyxide oil) as standard insecticide (1 ml + 2.5 ml/l) separately or combined with each other against Thrips tabaci nymphs and adults. The current study indicated that the single treatment with T. swirskii and N. cucumeris as well as the recommended combination (abamectin + Egyxide oil) were the most efficient as a bioagent control against T. tabaci in tomato plants in all three governorates, followed by T. nigavi, whereas P. persimilis and N. californicus has no role as a biocontrol agent for T. tabaci in single treatment compared with control. Moreover, alternately using predatory T. swirskii in combination with other predators (N. cucumeris, T. nigavi and N. californicus) showed significant reductions (95.8–99.95 %) in T. tabaci populations without any incompatibility or competition between each other compared with control in all three governorates (LSD: 3.46, indicated that there is no significant difference between treatments in all governorates). In general, the reduction effect of all treatments in El-Faiyum was decreased more than the other two governorates. This study demonstrated that T. tabaci in tomato can be reduced by using T. swirskii and N. cucumeris singly or alternately mixing with other predators mentioned above. In the light of these results, the T. swirskii and N. cucumeris singly or alternately should be considered when deciding on the timing of abamectin applications within IPM strategies.",

Damage by S. aurantii, through their feeding on avocado fruit results in corky tissue development (scarring), making the fruit unsuitable for export. The study aimed to monitor S. aurantii population dynamics during the critical early fruiting period by means of dispersal/emergence (D/E) traps and fruit infestation indices. The field efficacy of biologicals (Beauveria bassiana, Steinernema feltiae), the pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin, and the semi-synthetic spinosyn, spinetoram, against soil-dwelling stages of S. aurantii during early fruit development were determined. Finally, the study aimed to establish the pupation sites of S. aurantii in avocado. Above ground, population dynamics fluctuated directly in response to the host plant's phenological changes and were modified by rainfall. Control of soil-dwelling stages by the insecticides and the effectiveness of D/E traps in monitoring S. aurantii populations were not demonstrated, probably because the populations trapped using the D/E traps were not representative of the above-ground populations, as evidenced by fruit infestation indices. Under laboratory conditions, 81.60 % of mature larvae pupated away from the soil, demonstrating that S. aurantii does not passively drop to the ground in an avocado orchard, but actively seeks out dark, sheltered areas to pupate.",

(Merrill) (Leguminosae), cultivars, Duiker, Gazelle, Roan and SCSI, was measured in relation to different levels of artificial defoliation. Defoliation was induced manually, either as a single defoliation or sequentially over three different growth stages. At maturity, the yields of each cultivar at each defoliation treatment were obtained, and the reduction in yield compared to the undefoliated controls were converted to a percentage. Linear regressions of the percentage yield and percentage defoliation were fitted. The reduction in yield was influenced by cultivars, levels of defoliation, and the number of defoliations. The most critical growth stage for defoliation was the seed development stage, but differences in yield due to defoliation at the different growth stages were small and not significant. SCSI was the most resistant to defoliation, while Duiker was the most susceptible to single defoliations. Economic threshold levels were determined for the different soyabean cultivars based on the data that had a statistically significant linear relationship between percentage yield and defoliation. Based on three insecticides and two application methods, the economic thresholds were determined at the flowering stage for Duiker, at the pod development stage for Duiker and Roan and at the seed development stage for the Duiker, Gazelle, Roan and SCSI cultivars. In general, the estimated economic thresholds for the semiloopers ranged from 45 to 145 per metre of row, depending on the cultivar, insecticide and method of insecticide application. These thresholds equate to between two and seven semiloopers per plant.",
