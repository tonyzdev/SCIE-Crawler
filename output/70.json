    "abstract": "Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) emerges as a promising means to overcome the water scarcity of arid regions, especially for inland areas lacking liquid water sources. Beyond conventional system engineering that improves the water yield, novel moisture-harvesting materials provide new aspects to fundamentally promote the AWH technology benefiting from their high tunability and processability. Innovative material and structural designs enable the moisture harvesters with desirable features, such as high water uptake, facile water collection and long-term recyclability, boosting the rapid development of next-generation AWH. In this Perspective, we first illustrate the sorption mechanism, including absorption and adsorption for moisture-harvesting materials and summarize fundamental requirements, as well as design principles of moisture harvesters. Recent progress on material and structural designs of moisture harvesters for AWH is critically discussed. We conclude with prospective directions for next-generation moisture harvesters to promote AWH from scientific research to practical application.",

    "abstract": "Developing highly efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is a key step for rechargeable metal–oxygen batteries and water splitting. Usually, binary NiFe or ternary NiCoFe nano-alloys are used as the OER catalysts. Herein, combining the precursor alloy design with chemical etching, a simple dealloying route is developed to controllably incorporate five or more nonprecious metals into one nanostructured alloy with a naturally oxidized surface, that is, nanoporous high entropy alloys (np-HEAs) covered with high-entropy (oxy)hydroxides (HEOs). It is found that the alloy composition plays a dominant role in the OER activity enhancement with the np-AlNiCoFeX (X = Mo, Nb, Cr) combination showing the highest activity. Forming quinary HEAs also greatly enhances the electrochemical cycling stabilities compared with the ternary and quaternary counterparts. The result indicates the significance of synergistically incorporating five or more metal elements in one single-phase nanostructure, which provides more structural and chemical degrees of freedom to boost the catalytic performance, overcoming the restriction of normal binary or ternary alloys. Multinary transition metal-based np-HEA is a new class of promising catalyst for various important reactions.",

    "abstract": "Low-dimensional metal halides have been the focus of intense investigations in recent years following the success of hybrid lead halide perovskites as optoelectronic materials. In particular, the light emission of low-dimensional halides based on the 5s2 cations Sn2+ and Sb3+ has found utility in a variety of applications complementary to those of the three-dimensional halide perovskites because of its unusual properties such as broadband character and highly temperature-dependent lifetime. These properties derive from the exceptional chemistry of the 5s2 lone pair, but the terminology and explanations given for such emission vary widely, hampering efforts to build a cohesive understanding of these materials that would lead to the development of efficient optoelectronic devices. In this Perspective, we provide a structural overview of these materials with a focus on the dynamics driven by the stereoactivity of the 5s2 lone pair to identify the structural features that enable strong emission. We unite the different theoretical models that have been able to explain the success of these bright 5s2 emission centers into a cohesive framework, which is then applied to the array of compounds recently developed by our group and other researchers, demonstrating its utility and generating a holistic picture of the field from the point of view of a materials chemist. We highlight those state-of-the-art materials and applications that demonstrate the unique capabilities of these versatile emissive centers and identify promising future directions in the field of low-dimensional 5s2 metal halides.",

    "abstract": "Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been used in high resolution imaging and anticounterfeiting due to their long lifetime of phosphorescence ability to avoid interference from autofluorescence and excitation light. An important factor when considering phosphorescence is the high constant of the intersystem crossing (ISC) process. It is of great importance to develop novel pure organic RTP materials via precise manipulation of the ISC process and nonradiative decay rate. Encapsulation of a luminophore in the host matrix can avoid phosphorescence quenching caused by the presence of water and oxygen, while increasing intermolecular interaction to suppress nonradiative decay. Compared with polymeric and supramolecular host matrixes, organic small molecular host matrixes can provide possible molecular orbitals to facilitate the ISC process and enhance RTP emission. Herein, recent progress made in organic RTP materials using small molecular host matrixes and their mechanisms in realizing RTP emission are summarized. The design principles as well as possible applications of pure organic RTP materials based on the host–guest system are also revealed. Finally, future prospects on pure organic RTP materials involving small molecular host–guest systems are proposed.",

Here, we report the synthesis of nickel indium thiospinel nanosheets supported on carbon nanofibers (denoted as NiIn2S4/CNFs) via a facile in situ solvothermal growth process and, for the first time, demonstrate its superior bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performances as a precatalyst. Electrocatalytic experiments show that NiIn2S4/CNFs not only exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but also delivers a lower overpotential of 0.39 V for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm–2, outperforming those of monometallic Ni or In sulfides. Theoretical calculations confirm that the (220) and (111) plane in NiIn2S4 are selectively active to the ORR and OER, respectively. Apart from the intrinsic nature of NiIn2S4, the superior OER activity of NiIn2S4/CNFs is also related to the oxide/hydroxide species in-situ-formed on NiIn2S4 surface under the OER condition. Moreover, the developed NiIn2S4/CNFs pre-catalyst is demonstrated to be an efficient air-cathode for Zn–air batteries. This work brings a new perspective for designing various ternary thiospinels for energy conversion and storage.",

To this end, this work, for the first time, discovers that the salting-in effect possessed by a zwitterionic hydrogel is able to facilitate water vapor sorption by the hygroscopic salt under otherwise the same conditions. For demonstration, zwitterionic hydrogel of poly-[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (PDMAPS) was synthesized, and the hygroscopic salt of LiCl was embedded into PDMAPS to produce the salt-hydrogel composite. LiCl salt not only endows the sorbent with high water vapor sorption capacity but also facilitates the dissociation of self-association between cationic and anionic groups of PDMAPS. This salting-in effect was evaluated and confirmed experimentally and via density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The salting-in effect renders the zwitterionic hydrogel matrix with enhanced swelling capacity, leading to the sorbent's high AWH performance. With a photothermal component of CNT integrated into the sorbent, a fully solar energy-driven AWH process was demonstrated outdoors. This study provides important guidance to the design of hydrogel-based AWH sorbents.",

Its OER activity is much higher than the commercial RuO2 and among the highest ever-reported Ru-based OER catalysts. Its ORR catalytic activity is even higher than Pt/C, although Ru is not considered as a good ORR catalyst. Moreover, the oxidized surfaces of these HEAs are highly stable during continuous working conditions, which is crucial for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn–air batteries.",

The effective electrocatalyst is one of the key factors determining the future applications of this technology. In recent years, various catalysts, such as pristine carbon materials, modified carbon materials (oxidized or heteroatom doped such as nitrogen, fluorine, or sulfur doped), gold, or mercury alloyed palladium or platinum nanoparticles, as well as transition metal single atom catalysts (SACs) have been reported to effectively catalyze the H2O2 production via the two-electron ORR process. Among these candidates, SACs with 100% atom utilization and well-defined active centers attracted extra attention due to their high catalytic performance for H2O2 synthesis.

Compared to inorganic contrast agents, NIR-II organic dyes are more promising for biological application due to low molecular mass, good biocompatibility, and flexible molecular design. In this review, current chemical structures and applications of NIR-II organic dyes (polymethine dyes and donor–acceptor–donor dyes) are discussed. In addition, rational design strategies for NIR-II organic dyes, including conjugated chain length, chain length alternations, charge transfer between terminal groups, rigid plane chemical structure, and other factors, are summarized. This review may provide guidance for further development of novel NIR-II organic dyes for bioimaging and biosensing.",

    "abstract": "Nonbiodegradable plastics with inert and saturated C–C backbones comprise the majority of global annual plastics produced, including the ubiquitous polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene) and polystyrene. Unlike polymers with cleavable bonds, such as polyesters, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates, these inert plastics are the most challenging to upcycle and cannot be easily broken down by chemical or enzymatic means. Thus, they mostly end up in landfills or are incinerated to produce copious amounts of greenhouse emissions. In recent years, increased research effort has been focused toward the upcycling of low-value plastic waste to give them a new lease of life. However, the unreactive C–C polymer backbones of these plastics have posed formidable challenges for attempts at post-synthetic chemical functionalization and conversion into commodity chemicals. In this Perspective, we discuss these inert plastics as large untapped resources for the production of new functional polymeric materials and valuable industrially relevant feedstock, such as dicarboxylic acids and aromatic compounds. The exciting pioneering work featured herein will hopefully inspire a change in the way we view these waste plastics from a chemical dead-end to versatile raw materials, forming the basis of a more sustainable materials economy.",

However, current on-skin electrodes have poor conformal properties under sweaty condition in real-life because of decreased electrode-skin adhesion with sweat film at the interface. Here, we fabricated biocomposite electrodes based on silk fibroin (SF) through interfacial polymerization, which is applicable on sweaty skin. Interfacial polymerized conductive polypyrrole (PPy) and SF are structurally interlocked and endow the whole electrode with uniform stretchability. Existence of water results in similar Young's modulus of SF to the skin and enhanced interfacial adhesion. It keeps the electrodes conformal to skin under sweaty condition and allows reliable collection of ambulatory electrophysiological signals during sports and sweating. Wearable devices with these electrodes were used to acquire continuous and stable real-time electrocardiography (ECG) signals during running for 2 h. The collected signals can provide information for sports management and are also analyzed by artificial intelligence to show their potential for intelligent human emotion monitoring. Our strategy provides opportunities to record long-term continuous electrophysiological signals in real-life conditions for various smart monitoring systems.",

However, all alkali metal anodes are susceptible to dendrite growth, causing safety concerns, low energy efficiency, and short lifespan, which severely hampers their practical applications in working rechargeable batteries. Recently, alloy anodes with two metal components are effective to protect alkali metal anodes. In this Perspective, we analyze the alkali-metal alloy anodes based on their contribution to dendrite suppression, released capacity, and safety enhancement. Recent progress in alloy anodes, including Li/Na–X alloy (X represents the element of non-alkali metal), Li–Na alloy, and Na–K alloy, is reviewed. The perspectives and clear suggestions on the future of alkali-metal alloy anodes are presented. This sheds fresh light on the rational electrode architecture and materials for alkali metal anode and opens a new chapter for next-generation battery systems.",

    "abstract": "Directed self-assembly (DSA) of nanoparticles plays a key role in customizing advanced functional materials via collective and synergetic properties between neighbored building blocks. In comparison to the blossom of DSA in large (>3 nm) nanoparticle system witnessed in the past decades, the development of DSA in the sub-two-nanometer regime (e.g., underlying chemistry, fundamental properties of assemblies and potential applications) markedly lags behind. Thanks to continuous progress in synthetic chemistry and total structure determination of atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs, <2 nm), metal NCs have recently emerged as an ideal platform to uncovering DSA chemistry at this unique sub-nanometer size regime. In addition, recent achievements in DSA chemistry also manifest that DSA represents an alternative means (other than size and composition engineering of individual NC) to customizing molecular-like properties of metal NCs for practical applications. However, ascribed to the small size and large surface energy, linearly extending common nanoscale driving forces into the DSA setups of atomically precise metal NCs is not a trivial task. In this perspective, we systematically summarize recent advances on DSA chemistry in the sub-two-nanometer regime, according to the underlying molecular or nanoscale interactions in the DSA chemistry of metal NCs, including dipolar, van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bond, template effect, and amphiphilicity. We also discuss evoked or enhanced properties and thus potential applications of metal NCs made possible by DSA. The design principles and governing chemistry of DSA highlighted, here, may add to the acceptance of metal NCs as functional building blocks for construction of hierarchical architectures, which would not only exhibit promising properties for practical applications but also bring about fascinating opportunities for establishing self-assembly chemistry in a broad size regime.",

Here, we report a metastable trigonal phase of Li3YbCl6 with an ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10–4 S·cm–1 and mixed-metal halide solid electrolytes, Li3–xYb1–xZrxCl6, with conductivities up to 1.1 mS·cm–1 at room temperature. Combined neutron, single-crystal, and powder X-ray diffraction methods reveal that Zr-substitution for Yb in Li3YbCl6 triggers a trigonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition and forms new, lower energy pathways for Li-ion migration. All-solid-state cell cycling with uncoated >4 V-class cathodes is enabled by the high electrochemical oxidation stability of the mixed-metal halide solid electrolyte.",

    "abstract": "Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) allows nanoparticles (NPs) to harvest light and concentrate it near the nanoparticle surface. Light energy is utilized in the generation of excited charge carriers as well as heat. Plasmonic catalysts used these energetic charge carriers (and the heat) to drive chemical reactions on their surface and allowed the discovery of novel and selective reaction pathways that were not possible in thermal catalysis. This review discusses the fundamentals of plasmonic catalysis and its application for CO2 conversion to fuel and chemicals. We first discussed the fundamentals of LSPR and the mechanism of plasmonic photocatalysis, using the concepts of the dielectric function, charge carrier generation, and relaxation pathways. We then reviewed various charge carrier-mediated activation of molecules (their chemical bonds) on the surface of plasmonic nanocatalysts and how the extraction of charge carriers played a critical role in plasmonic catalysis. The concept of multicomponent plasmonic catalysis, a hybrid catalyst by combining plasmonic metals (Cu, Au, Ag, Al, etc.) with nonplasmonic but active catalytic metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, etc.), in close proximity to each other, was then discussed. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions using the examples of each of three major pathways, (i) direct transfer of hot charge carriers to the reactant molecules, (ii) providing heat to the reactant molecules by photothermal effect, and (iii) enhancing the photon absorption rate of reactant molecules by optical near-field enhancement close to the nanocatalyst surface, were discussed. In the last section, we reviewed plasmonic photocatalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM) using CO2, which uses two greenhouse gases as feed to produce industrially significant syngas. Overall, the review is broadly divided into four sections: (1) Fundamentals of Plasmonic Nanomaterials, (2) Mechanism of Plasmonic Photocatalysis, (3) Plasmonic Photocatalysts for CO2 Reduction to Fuels and Chemicals, and (4) Plasmonic Photocatalysts for Methane Dry Reforming using CO2; with each section divided into several subsections.",

Despite being effective in hole-extraction and interfacial passivation, its hole-transporting capability is limited by the insulating alkyl linker, along with poor stability due to the isolated and nonconjugated electron-rich moiety. Here, we report a series of conjugated SAMs that exhibit excellent photo- and electrical stabilities. The conjugated molecular structure not only enhances charge transport but also stabilizes the electron-rich arylamines through electron/charge delocalization. Moreover, it enables convenient modulation of frontier orbital energy levels for interfacial band alignment. By scrutinization of the conjugation-linker and hole-transporting head, an optimal conjugated SAM (MPA-Ph-CA) in combination with the standard triple cation perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.92MA0.08)0.95Pb(I0.92Br0.08)3 achieved an efficient inverted PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.53% (certified 22.12%). Moreover, the MPA-Ph-CA based devices showed excellent stability, retaining over 95% of their initial PCEs under one sun constant irradiation for 800 h. The synchronously enhanced efficiency and stability suggest that conjugated SAM-based HSCs are promising for further advancing inverted PSCs.",

    "abstract": "Hot melt adhesives are widely applied owing to their solvent-free nature. Developing robust and multi-reusable hot melt adhesives without harsh bonding conditions remains a great challenge. Herein, we develop a novel strategy of incorporating flexible side chains into the network of highly noncovalently cross-linked hot melt adhesives to construct super strong and multi-reusable supramolecular epoxy hot melt adhesives (SEA). The SEA was prepared via polycondensation of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with O-(2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone)-O′-(2-aminopropyl)polypropylene glycol (the noncovalent cross-linker) and O-(2-aminopropyl)-O′-(2-methoxyethyl)polypropylene glycol (the flexible side chain). Impressively, the prepared SEA was endowed with a super high adhesion strength of 10.2 MPa, which is the highest adhesion strength in bonding stainless steel among hot melt adhesives constructed by dynamic bonds to the best of our knowledge. It also featured excellent multiple reusability with more than 80% of the original adhesion strength remained even after reuse for six times. Meanwhile, the SEA displayed an outstanding ability to bond diverse substrates tightly under considerably moderate bonding conditions (80 °C for 5 min). It is highly anticipated that this work will open a new avenue of designing hot melt adhesives with the high adhesion strength and excellent multiple reusability.",

Through precise regulation of functional materials and elaborate design of the solid/liquid interface, the interactions between water molecules and functional materials enable the generation of considerable electricity, giving researchers an alternative to extract renewable energy from water. In this Perspective, we will systematically discuss the water-enabled electricity generation (WEG) technologies, based on the interactions between functional materials and water. We mainly classify the WEGs into three types: mechanical-to-electric WEG, thermal-to-electric WEG, and chemical-to-electric WEG, according to the energy source of input water and the mode of energy conversion. For each type of WEG, the basic working principles for generating electricity are outlined, accompanied by a summary and comparison of system structures, working types, and performance characteristics. Recent significant progress in terms of the development of functional materials and the design of devices are emphasized. Efficient strategies involving a deep understanding of the solid/liquid interface and the structure of electric double layer, kinetics of ions adsorption, migration and diffusion or combination thereof, are also discussed. Then, we survey nascent fields promising to advance the development of WEGs, particularly in the area of self-powered and wearable electronics. The general requirements for developing next-generation functional materials for high-performance WEGs are further concluded, as well as standards for WEG's performance testing. The scientific and technological challenges and opportunities of WEG are finally addressed for future studies and practical applications.",

Situated in one group of the periodic table of elements, tin (Sn) has the same valence electrons' configuration as Pb (ns2np2), promising analogous chemical properties. Hence, Sn is considered a suitable replacement to Pb. However, because of the lack of lanthanide shrinkage, Sn behaves differently: Pb is stable in Pb2+ form, an oxidation state needed for perovskite structure, while Sn tends to lose all its valence electrons forming Sn4+. As a result, PSCs based on Sn are not efficient. Traces of oxygen have been conventionally discussed as a source of Sn oxidation. But recent findings point to the oxidation of Sn-based perovskites even in the absence of oxygen. This perspective summarizes recently-discovered unconventional oxidation pathways of Sn perovskites, including reaction with solvent molecules and disproportionation. We explain these phenomena by a Frost–Ebsworth diagram and argue that a deeper understanding of this diagram is a key toward stable and efficient Pb-free Sn-based PSCs.",

Here, we introduce a hybrid hydrogel (GGG) with inherent immunomodulatory capabilities for IDFUs. GGG is composed of interpenetrating polymer networks featuring gallium-induced self-assembling glycyrrhizic acid and a photo-cross-linked gelatin methacryloyl matrix. Importantly, GGG effectively decreases the ratio of M1 to M2 macrophages in conditions infected with drug-resistant bacteria by disrupting iron metabolism and scavenging reactive oxygen species, which contributes to enhanced treatment results for diabetic wounds. To sum up, the immunomodulatory strategy we present provides a straightforward, safe, and highly effective therapeutic avenue for managing IDFUs.",

Furthermore, the COFs coating enables the formation of PNCs–COFs heterojunction, which facilitates the generation and transportation of photoinduced charge carriers. The PNCs–COFs were further applied as photocatalysts for free-radical polymerizations, photoactivating different coinitiators via both hole and electron transfer mechanisms in aqueous and organic phases. The excellent photocatalytic performance of PNCs–COFs was confirmed by high monomer conversion (up to 97.5%), diverse functional group tolerance and recyclability.",

This Perspective focuses on the achievements on the mechanically robust dynamically cross-linked polymers with healability and recyclability. The strategies for the reinforcement of healable/recyclable polymers are highlighted, considering that the dynamically cross-linked polymers generally exhibit low mechanical robustness.

Nitrate electroreduction is showing great potential as an alternative route for the green and scale-up synthesis of ammonia at ambient conditions. However, the performance has lagged due to lack of efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of uniform Cu nanodisks with exposed (111) facets as highly active electrocatalyst for electrochemical ammonia synthesis, delivering a high ammonia yield of 2.16 mg mg–1cat h–1 and a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 81.1% at −0.5 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The remarkable activity is originated from the surface reconstructed triatomic Cu clusters due to the cathodic deoxygenation process. As a result, the reconstructed surface shows enhanced affinity to the adsorption of nitrate ions which undergo successive break of three N–O bonds, followed by subsequent formation of three N–H bonds to finally form NH3. The present study provides the feasible preparation of Cu based advanced catalysts and a unique insight into the mechanism of nitrate electroreduction.",

It is well-known that significant progress has been made in artificial vision systems based on light sensors, but the separate light sensor and memory require additional time for information transfer to realize computation due to the limitation of the von Neumann architecture, which delays the computational speed and hinders large-scale integration. In recent years, the emergence of photoelectric memristors has brought new inspiration to the study of machine vision, which is expected to overcome the above problems. Photoelectric memristors can not only respond directly to light stimuli but also perform temporary memory and real-time processing of visual information and sensory data, providing a promising hardware foundation for the development of artificial vision systems. In this review, the background and related theory of photoelectric memristors and machine vision are first introduced. Then, the research progress of photoelectric memristors and machine vision based on them is reviewed. Finally, the existing problems impeding the progress of machine vision based on photoelectric memristors are summarized, and the future development is predicted.",

Herein, we show the first example of utilizing a bimetal metal–organic framework (MOF-818) platform for mimicking of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), an important antioxidant enzyme that specifically scavenges superoxide anions. Experimental data and theoretical calculations reveal that the high Cu/Zn-SOD-like activity of MOF-818 results from the bimetal synergistic catalysis, which is analogous to natural Cu/Zn-SOD. Such a bimetal biomimetic process allows for MOF-818 with much higher SOD-like activity, compared to the reported monometallic MOFs mimics. Moreover, the SOD-like MOF-818 displays excellent stability against heating, organic solvents, and denaturant treatments, which should inactivate natural enzymes. Based on the catalytic mechanism, we also construct a MOF-818-based colorimetric sensing platform for phosphorylated peptides and proteins detection. This work provides a new insight for biomimetic engineering, and may expedite the scale-up applications of SOD-like nanozymes in various fields.",

Two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant exposed active sites have great potential as catalyst materials with high electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a sequence of 2D MOF (TMN2O2, TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures with 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene and 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexamine were designed and investigated for their catalytic performance in ORR and OER by using density functional theory. Calculation results reveal that TMN2O2 (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) structures have superior thermodynamic and electrochemical stability during the electrocatalytic process. Based on oxygen and water molecule activation and free energy calculations, the CoN2O2 structure exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER with low overpotential values of 0.33 and 0.30 V, respectively. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for OER/ORR can be attributed to the moderate adsorption interaction of CoN2O2 structure with key intermediates. The valence orbital contribution of Co-3dz2 is critical for adjusting the interaction with the *OOH intermediate, resulting in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance for both ORR and OER.",

    "abstract": "Surface passivation has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to reduce defects of hybrid halide perovskite films for making efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially the strong interaction between the passivation agents and the perovskite films is favorable for achieving a durable passivation effect. Pyridine derivatives with bidentate anchoring groups can interact with the uncoordinated Pb2+ and minimize perovskite defects. Herein, in order to rationally design bidentate passivation agents, the passivation effects of pyridine (Py) and its derivatives (Py-X) with different functional groups of amino, carboxyl acid, and aldehyde are compared in carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) for the first time. Py-NH2 is found to passivate the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film the best among all the passivation agents. The N atoms on both the pyridine ring and the amino group with lone pair electrons can combine with the uncoordinated Pb2+, effectively reducing the defect density in the Py-NH2-treated perovskite film. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the strong interaction between Py-NH2 and CH3NH3PbI3 strengthens Pb–I bond and hinders the formation of I vacancies. Carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) passivated by Py-NH2 achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.75%, compared to 11.55% of the control device. The Py-NH2 passivated C-PSCs also exhibit good long-term stability, retaining more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 30 days of storage in air with 35–45% relative humidity.",

    "abstract": "Si-based anode materials offer significant advantages, such as high specific capacity, low voltage platform, environmental friendliness, and abundant resources, making them highly promising candidates to replace graphite anodes in the next generation of high specific energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the commercialization of Si-based anodes for LIBs encounters significant barriers due to inherent challenges. These challenges encompass a range of issues, including poor electrical conductivity, substantial volume expansion during the lithiation–delithiation process, severe pulverization of the electrodes, pronounced thickening of the solid electrolyte interphase film, low Coulombic efficiency, and limited cycling performance. Each of these factors leads to the complexity of realizing the full potential of Si-based anodes in commercial LIBs applications. This review provides a comprehensive summary and discussion of recent research on Si-based LIB anodes, focusing on the microscopic morphology of Si and the development of Si-based composite materials. By offering a novel perspective, this review aims to provide an overview and insightful discussion of Si-based anodes. The latest research findings are presented, and innovative viewpoints and reasonable insights are addressed, shedding light on the potential solutions to overcome the limitations associated with Si-based anodes.",

The structure determination and simulations from powder X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that these COFs have high crystallinity derived from the packing of covalently linked two-dimensional isoreticular layer frameworks. As nitrogen-rich porous materials, iodine capture studies were carried out, proving that they displayed obvious enhancements in iodine uptake as compared with the pristine cage itself. In particular, Cage-IRCOF-1 displayed an iodine adsorption capacity of 262 wt %, which is 12 times higher than the solid packed from the cage itself. Spectral studies revealed that there were strong interactions between the nitrogen-rich groups and the adsorbed iodine species. This work demonstrated that linking the discrete organic cages into reticular crystalline frameworks, effective adsorbents can be fabricated for targeted applications.",

Triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA)-based materials have been emerging as a new category of electroluminescent or host materials with promising potential for highly efficient and stable blue devices due to their appealing photophysical properties (e.g., ability to generate emissive singlet excited states through TTA process, high photoluminescence quantum yield, ease of molecular design, etc.).

In this review, recent research advances on the molecular design strategies, photophysical properties of TTA-based materials (both blue emitters and host materials), mechanism of TTA-based electroluminescence, as well as their OLED applications are presented comprehensively. Moreover, potential perspectives with future research opportunities in this field are also described. We believe that the emerging TTA-based materials will bring more opportunities for developing a large family of novel photofunctional materials showing appealing and tunable photophysical properties, thus providing new opportunities for high-efficiency and stable blue electroluminescence in the future.",

In this work, a multifunctional hydrogel dressing was achieved by introducing mussel-like super adhesion catechol groups and glucose/ROS-sensitive dynamic phenylboronester bond cross-linking network, which endowed the hydrogel with excellent injectable, self-healing, tissue adhesion properties, and glucose/ROS-sensitive drug release performance.

Moreover, excellent biocompatibility and antioxidant performance were shown in the hydrogels. Finally, the hydrogel could fully fill and adhere to irregular wound tissue through injection and significantly promote infected diabetic wound healing in vivo through efficient photothermal synergistic sterilization, ROS scavenging ability, and modulation of macrophage M2 polarization to reduce inflammatory response.

However, the limited available catalytic active sites and competitive hydrogen evolution make the catalytic performance still unsatisfactory. In this work, interfacial defect engineering via single atom doping was conducted to achieve highly efficient electrocatalytic NO3RR. Upon introduction of isolated Fe atoms, abundant oxygen vacancies are generated over atomic interface of TiO2, and the induced charge redistribution triggers the formation of considerable active sites for nitrate reduction, which plays a crucial role in inhibiting the proton reduction and promoting the adsorption and activation of nitrate.

Here, we demonstrate a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor based on ZnO@MXene hybrid heterostructure for ultrahigh NH3 gas detection under UV illumination at room temperature (RT). Under UV illumination, the ZnO@MXene SAW sensor not only significantly enhances the frequency response (Δf ≈ 32.24 kHz/20 ppm) but also effectively improves the selectivity with a low detection limit (89.41 ppb), short response/recovery times (92/104 s), long-term stability, and robust sensitivity under various relative humidity conditions (dark) to NH3 at RT. These unique NH3 sensing properties might be attributed to the enriched functional groups, oxygen vacancies, and excellent charge transfer at the Schottky barrier via band bending, which is explained using an energy band theory sensing mechanism. Overall, the current study offers strategic insights for designing light-activated high-performance SAW-based RT NH3 sensors in safety assurance and environmental monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a valuable chemical, is widely used as a powerful oxidizing agent in chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, medical disinfection, and environmental treatment industries. Currently, over 95% of H2O2 is produced industrially using the anthraquinone process, which is associated with its high energy consumption and hazardous byproducts. Therefore, the photochemical synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen using covalent organic framework based photocatalysts have attracted considerable attention. This review aims to outline recent achievements, challenges and future prospects of COFs as heterogeneous photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 generation. We summarize the chronological development of COFs, different mechanisms involved, and detailed experiments and quantification methods of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The review puts forward an outlook, highlighting the advantages and limitations of COFs for H2O2 generation. We anticipate that this review will provide insight into current progress and inspire the development of next-generation photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.",

Here, we demonstrate a smart-puffing transparent flexible phosphite-protonated siloxane (PSiP) that simultaneously exhibits excellent fire protection, high-temperature insulation, antibacterial, antimold, and self-healing properties. A facile one-step method is developed to create this microporous PSiP using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and phosphite via hydrophilic–hydrophobic interaction-driven self-assembly. Notably, PSiP employs an intelligent thermal-responsive self-puffing behavior to achieve high-temperature insulation, effectively blocking 87.8% of 1400 °C heat. The unique dynamic phosphite-protonated siloxane network in PSiP with high transparency (>92% in the visible region) affords self-healing ability as well as potent defense against fire and bacteria (>99% efficiency).

Moreover, controlled variations in the molar ratio of Zn/Cd regulate the electron–hole separation capability, thereby endowing Zn0.8Cd0.2S with the optimum syngas and acetate production rates.

Herein, for the first time, we have reviewed the current different approaches for avoiding chloride oxidation during seawater electrolysis, critically highlighting their advantages and disadvantages while giving a critical perspective for any future research in the field.",

    "abstract": "The development of renewable energy conversion devices heavily relies on the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for water electrolysis systems. In this study, a Se-doped RuO2 aerogel (Se-RuO2 aerogel) with abundant defects is prepared as an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in acidic media. The Se-RuO2 aerogel exhibits a remarkably low overpotential of 166 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and long-term stability of up to 48 h. Concurrently, detailed in situ experiments demonstrate that the Se-RuO2 aerogel can maintain excellent stability during the OER process, for their reaction path follows a more stable adsorption evolution mechanism. Therefore, it can operate for 100 h at a current density of 100 mA cm–2 when assembled as an anode catalyst in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. This work provides a new vision for the design of high-performance electrocatalysts based on aerogel with defect engineering.",

Recently, Li-ion conducting halide-based SEs have attracted enormous attention owing to their electrochemical, mechanical, and transport properties. Despite the success of Li-ion conducting halides, the research on the Na analogue remains sparse, and the reported ionic conductivities are limited. In this study, we demonstrate the significantly improved ionic conductivity in NaM5+Cl6 (M5+ = Nb, Ta) by extending the existing structural framework of the Na-ion conducting halides Na3M3+Cl6 (M3+ = Y, Er) and Na2ZrCl6. Transport analysis reveals that the cation M rules the activation energies of the resulting phases. Given that M is pivotal, a further fine-tuning of M in NaMCl6 leads to a high ionic conductivity of 0.1 mS cm–1 at 30 °C, owing to a beneficial inductive effect and enhanced migration entropy. These discoveries will provide more design strategies for Na-ion conducting halide-based SEs.",

In this study, we demonstrate the generation of transition metal-based dichalcogenides (TMDCs)-based conformational (flower-like) nanoarchitectonics for synergistic trimodal therapies against breast carcinoma. Initially, the progressive transformation of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum selenide (MoSe2)-based nanosheets into nanoflower-like architectures by the thermal injection method is observed with time. Further, these flowers are subsequently decorated with an optimal amount of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles for nanocatalytic efficacy and surface-modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for improved biocompatibility, shortly denoted as Pt-MoSe2-PEG for light-assisted photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic (PDT), as well as light-augmented chemodynamic (CDT) modalities. A series of physicochemical characterizations and performance validations successfully demonstrated the generation of tumor (pH/GSH)-responsive degradable nanoflower-like structures, substantially improving their ability of reactive oxygen species generation, MoSe2-based PTT/PDT capability, and light-augmented CDT efficacy of the Pt nanoenzymes. Finally, in vitro and in vivo investigations in the 4T1 cell line and its xenograft tumor model in BALB/C mice, respectively, validated the synergistic trimodal therapies of Pt-MoSe2-PEG toward ablating breast carcinoma.",

However, UOR suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics due to its complex six-electron transfer processes combined with conversion of complicated intermediates. Herein, LaNiO3–NiO heterojunctions successfully constructed to accelerate UOR. Systematic experimental investigation and theoretical calculation endorse that self-driven local charge redistribution takes place at the Janus LaNiO3/NiO interface, generating local nucleophilic and electrophilic regions. Such a unique structure is favorable for targeted adsorption of amino groups and electrophilic carbonyl groups, thus promoting the rupture of C–N bonds in urea. In addition, the build-in electric field triggered by LaNiO3–NiO heterojunction could effectively diminish the stepwise energy barrier, accelerating desorption of *CO2. As a result, the LaNiO3–NiO exhibits superior UOR performance, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at 1.34 V (vs RHE). This work supplies valuable insights for fundamental understanding and rational construction of efficient heterojunction UOR catalyst.",

This study presents a rational design of violet emitters by establishing a through-space charge transfer (TSCT) framework that enhances high-level reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) for the effective utilization of triplet excitons. Two TSCT emitters, BO-MX-ICz and tBO-MX-ICz, are tailored with a weak donor and acceptor bridged by 9,9-dimethylxanthene in a face-to-face stacking arrangement. These emitters show narrow violet photoluminescence (PL) with a high efficiency. Their OLEDs exhibit high-color-purity violet electroluminescence (EL) with peaks at 406 and 408 nm, a full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 25 nm, and maximum external quantum efficiencies (ηext,maxs) of 4.61% and 5.03%. Additionally, as hosts for green multiresonance (MR) emitters, they deliver narrow EL spectra and excellent ηext,maxs up to 34.36%. This molecular strategy could advance high-performance short-wavelength emitters for optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "After the past decade's rapid development, the commercial demands for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been put on the schedule for large-scale energy storage. Even though the electrode-electrolyte interphases play a very important role in determining the overall battery performance in terms of high energy density and long-cycling stability, studies regarding their fundamental understanding and regulation strategies are still in their infancy. Herein, we comprehensively review the current research status and the challenging issues of the as-generated SIB interphases from three main aspects. Firstly, a fundamental understanding of the main body interphase layers is introduced through the development of their formation mechanism, their composition/structure, and the dynamic evolution process involved, all of which are highly responsible for the Na+ ion transport behavior to determine the final kinetic diffusion. Then, interphase manipulation via the parental electrolyte is summarized in terms of electrolyte engineering strategies, such as the solvent/salt selection, the concentration effect, and the functional additive screening to build a more stable interphase layer for desirable electrochemical reversibility. Finally, potential effects from the chosen electrodes are discussed to provide necessary associations with the interphase formation and evolution. Critical challenges for building stable Na-based interphase are identified, and in particular, new ways of thinking about the interphase chemistry and the electrolyte chemistry based on SIBs, are strongly appealing. We believe that this work is likely to attract attention to the rational design of Na-based interphase layers towards high-energy and long-life-span batteries.",

However, the practical applications of Li–S batteries have been hindered by a low utilization efficiency of sulfur arising from complicated chemical conversion of polysulfides and the corrosion of Li metal electrode during charge/discharge processes. Single atom catalysts (SACs) consisting of atomically-dispersed metal sites have been recently exploited as high-performance electrocatalytic materials in various energy storage devices, including Li–S batteries, because of their unique catalytic properties and maximized atom efficiency. In this mini-review, we first describe the major roadblocks and opportunities for the development of commercial Li–S batteries. Following that, we will highlight the specific roles of SAC materials, which are used as cathodes, separators, interlayers, electrolytes, and anodes in Li–S batteries. The detailed catalytic conversion mechanism of polysulfides and nucleation process of Li ions over single-atom active sites are also discussed. Finally, we highlight major challenges to be addressed in this field and provide our perspectives in the rational design and synthesis of superior SACs to accelerate their application in Li–S batteries.",

These low-dimensional perovskites suppressed halide ion migration as a result of their intercalated spacer ligands and their strong van der Waals interactions. The rate constants for halide exchange of low dimensionality perovskites follow the Arrhenius relationship with thermal activation energy ranging from 58 kJ/mol (n = 10) to 72 kJ/mol (n = 1).

Sb(III) is particularly appealing for its oxidative stability (compared to Ge2+ and Sn2+) and low toxicity (compared to Pb2+). Square pyramidal SbX5 anion had thus far been the most common structural motif for realizing high luminescence efficiency, typically when cocrystallized with an organic cation. Luminescent hybrid organic–inorganic halides with octahedral coordination of Sb(III) remain understudied, whereas fully inorganic compounds show very limited structural engineerability. We show that the host–guest complexation of alkali metal cations with crown ethers fosters the formation of zero-dimensional Sb(III) halides and allows for adjusting the coordination number (5 or 6). The obtained compounds exhibit bright photoluminescence with quantum yields of up to 89% originating from self-trapped excitons, with emission energies, Stokes shifts, and luminescence lifetimes finely-adjustable by structural engineering. A combination of environmental stability and strong, intrinsic temperature-dependence of the luminescence lifetimes in the nanosecond-to-microsecond range nominate these compounds as highly potent luminophores for remote thermometry and thermography owing to their sensitivity range of 200–450 K and high specific sensitivities of 0.04 °C–1.",

This cell displays excellent cycling stability at 30 °C with capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles at C/5 and 77% after 500 cycles at 1C. The cell reaches a specific energy of 64 Wh kg–1 on the basis of the active masses of both electrodes, twice as high as previously reported for this electrode couple. Further, the cell can be operated down to temperatures of at least −10 °C, with capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles at C/5.",

    "abstract": "Atomically precise noble metal nanoclusters are ultrasmall particles that are typically composed of tens to hundreds of metal atoms in the core (equivalent sizes 1–3 nm). This new class of nanomaterials is unique in that they are atomically precise and possess uniform structures, high stability, and attractive properties. Built on the significant success of Au nanoclusters, Ag nanoclusters have recently received increasing attention. The majority of reported silver nanocluster sizes exhibit molecular-like properties, whereas larger ones exhibit plasmons characteristic of metallic state (as opposed to molecular state in smaller sizes). Both molecular (i.e., nonmetallic) and metallic nanoclusters hold promise in a wide range of applications. To deepen the understanding of their physical and chemical properties, precise control over size and determination of the crystal structure are the top priorities. In recent developments, dozens of silver nanoclusters with definite formulas have been prepared through various strategies, albeit the structural determination still lags behind. In this short Review, we summarize the recent progress in ligand-protected silver nanoclusters, including the size-focusing synthetic methods, new sizes, structures, and properties.",

We start by arguing that perovskites, like any other semiconducting material, are not immune to the negative effects of mismanaged strain. We analyze the origin—and detrimental consequences—of lattice strain in perovskite crystals and heterostructures. We then discuss how strain management addresses the polymorphism issue of some of the most desirable perovskite compositions, and how it prevents the harmful migration of ions in perovskites. We conclude by offering our perspective on the unexplored potential of strain engineering and argue that its controlled management can lead to untapped territories, including perovskite large-area single-crystalline thin films and electrically pumped lasers.",

Benefitting from the efficient stabilizing effect of triplet states of CDs by SBT zeolite matrix, CDs@SBT-1 with a larger singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔEST) of 0.36 eV exhibits predominant RTP with a lifetime of 574 ms, while CDs@SBT-2 with a smaller ΔEST value of 0.18 eV shows TADF with a lifetime of 153 ms. Further investigations reveal that different organic templates result in different CDs structures, thus modulating the ΔEST values of CDs@zeolites.

However, achieving efficient blue emissions is challenging for this class of materials, as structural distortions of metal halides often lead to large Stokes shifts. Here we report a highly luminescent blue emitting 0D organic lead bromide, (C13H19N4)2PbBr4, with a peak emission of 460 nm (2.70 eV), a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 66 nm (0.40 eV), a Stokes shift of 111 nm (0.85 eV), and a PLQE of ∼40%. Single crystal structure analysis shows that individual PbBr42– species adopt a near-seesaw structure, which are coordinated to benzyl-hexamethylenetetrammonium (C13H19N4+) organic cations. The relatively small Stokes shift as compared to those of previously reported 0D organic metal halide hybrids are attributed to the low chemical reactivity of Pb 6s2 lone pairs and the rigid organic cationic matrix. (C13H19N4)2PbBr4 also shows exceptional stability in air with little-to-no change of properties for more than a year in ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "Lead halide compounds, including lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), have attracted the interest of researchers in optoelectronics and photonics because of their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) coupled with relatively short PL lifetimes (on the order of a few nanoseconds). However, lead-free metal halides of high PLQY, including double perovskites and their doped NCs, typically possess long PL lifetimes (up to microseconds) that limit their application space. Here, we introduce CsMnBr3 NCs, which are lead-free and red-emitting, that combine a high PLQY with an exceptionally short radiative lifetime (on the order of picoseconds). We find that the octahedral coordination of Mn2+ in CsMnBr3 induces a red emission centered at ∼643 nm with a PLQY of ∼54% and a fast radiative decay rate. Femtosecond transient absorption and transient PL spectroscopies reveal the existence of a low-lying excited state of Mn2+ that relaxes to the ground state within around 605 ps by emitting light at around 643 nm. At greater excitation energies, higher excited states of Mn2+ relax in the sub-nanosecond time scale to this low-lying excited state. A similarly positioned PL peak with a short picosecond scale PL lifetime and a PLQY of ∼6.7% was also detected in bulk CsMnBr3 single crystals reported in this study—a relatively high quantum yield for a bulk material. Our experimental results and density functional theory modelling show that the crystal structure and the strong coupling among Mn2+ ions govern those luminescence properties of CsMnBr3 NCs and single crystals. These findings pave the way for new lead-free materials that combine high PLQY and ultrafast luminescence.",

As the most representative type of all TMDs, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-based nanomaterials are expanded into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, quantum dots (QDs), flower-like nanoparticles, nanospheres and nanotubes. These types are regarded as promising nanoplatforms for various applications in biomedicine, such as drug delivery, phototherapy, biosensing, bioimaging, theranostics, and antimicrobials, because of the unique planar structures, superb electronic and optical properties (such as thickness-dependent bandgap, strong near-infrared absorbance, and large surface area), and easily functionalized surface sites.

Here, we systematically summarized the progress of functionalized MoS2-based nanomaterials with improved physicochemical and biological properties for the biomedical applications. First, we emphatically introduced these biomedical applications in drug delivery, anticancer photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and combined phototherapy. Besides, other biomedical applications were also introduced in detail including bioimaging, biosensing, theranostics, toxicity, tissue engineering, and antimicrobials. Lastly, the current challenges, opportunities and prospects of MoS2-based nanomaterials were also discussed in depth. We expect that this review will contribute to a quick and in-depth understanding of the latest progress in bioapplication of MoS2-based nanomaterials, inspiring the creation of various techniques to design and fabricate MoS2-based nanomaterials with multiple capability and high biological safety, and expand them into more application in the field of biomedicine.",

However, the high interfacial resistance between Na metal anode and NASICON SE is still thwarting the stable operation of SSBs. In this work, we successfully reduce the Na|NASICON interfacial resistance from 1658 to 101 Ω·cm2 by lowering surface tension of Na metal via compositing Na metal with amorphous SiO2. Enabled by the enhanced interface contact, the solid-state Na-SiO2|NASICON|Na-SiO2 symmetric cell can endure current density up to 500 μA/cm2 and stably cycle for more than 135 h, while Na|NASICON|Na symmetric cell shorts in less than 10 h under 100 μA/cm2.

    "abstract": "Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are usually synthesized in powder form. For many practical applications, MOFs need to be shaped into monoliths that can be easily handled. However, conventional shaping methods, such as pelletization, often result in a decrease in functionality. Recently, MOF-containing monoliths have been made using direct ink writing (DIW; extrusion 3D printing), but to date, high additive loadings have been required. In this work, we demonstrate that colloidal gels containing only ethanol and Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) (HKUST-1) nanoparticles can be used directly as an ink for the DIW of pure densely packed and self-standing MOF monoliths. The MOF gel shows ideal rheological properties for 3D extrusion-based printing, suggesting this method may be generalized to other MOF families that form gels. Importantly, the accessible porosity and surface area of the MOF is retained well after shaping. The 3D printed HKUST-1 monolith displays an exceptionally high BET surface area of 1134 m2/g, and a high mesopore volume. We demonstrate that for methane storage, a classical application of HKUST-1, the 3D printed monolith is comparable or superior to monoliths formed by other shaping methods.",

Nanoscale covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been developing as a significant category of biomedical nanomaterials with good application prospects on account of their high porosity, functionality, and biocompatibility. The high porosity of COFs permits the encapsulation of distinctive imaging and/or therapeutic agents with high loading efficiency. In some cases, organic building blocks can be employed to load therapeutic drugs and/or functional species through covalent bonding. The organic building blocks of COFs can also be post-modified for specific binding to biomarkers. The unique characteristics of COFs make them promising nanocarriers for bioimaging and therapeutic applications. Despite energetic research on the rational design and fabrication of COFs having been conducted for nearly a decade, the therapeutic applications of nanoscale COFs still remain less understood. This review mainly summarizes the recent research advances in the COF design and their applications in the biomedical field. In particular, the bioimaging and therapeutic applications of COFs are discussed, which include fluorescence bioimaging and different treatment approaches containing chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and synergistic therapy. The review also illustrates the fundamental challenges facing COF-based nanosystems in terms of size control, surface modification, biodistribution, toxicity, and biocompatibility. This review aims to promote multidisciplinary research at the interface of COFs and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used industrial chemicals that are of a great concern because of their pervasive presence in water resources and association with negative health effects. Crosslinked β-cyclodextrin-containing (β-CD) polymer adsorbents have shown promising performances for sequestering PFAS. Recently, installing amino groups into the crosslinkers of a β-CD polymer network improved the binding of many anionic PFAS, including short-chain and branched derivatives. However, the relative importance of the electrostatic interactions from the amino groups and the host-guest interactions within the cavity of the β-CD for PFAS binding are unclear. Herein, β-CD-based adsorbents crosslinked with tripodal crosslinkers containing three amino or amido groups are prepared with comparable physicochemical properties to investigate the respective roles of the crosslinker and β-CD in binding affinity and capacity for anionic PFAS. β-CD polymers containing amines showed superior removal for ten anionic PFAS compared to polymers containing amido groups. Both β-CD polymers have superior performance for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) removal compared to activated carbons (ACs), consistent with β-CD:PFOA inclusion complexes playing an important role. Adsorbents containing amido groups showed low binding affinity and capacity for GenX, whereas the amine-functionalized polymer had outstanding affinity and capacity for GenX (KL = 8.8 × 104 M–1, QM = 222 mg g–1), underscoring the essential role of electrostatic interactions for removing short-chain and branched PFAS. The amine-containing β-CD polymer exhibited 100-fold higher affinity and twice the capacity (KL = 1.8 × 106 M–1, QM = 457 mg g–1) for PFOA compared to GenX, which are the highest reported values for β-CD polymers. These results highlight the synergistic effects of electrostatic interactions and host-guest interactions in β-CD polymers as important design criteria for efficient removal of anionic PFAS from water. This study further demonstrates broad tunability of crosslinked β-CD polymers and their promise as adsorbents for PFAS remediation.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary advancements in perovskite semiconductors are visibly impacting the progress of light conversion applications. These alluring photo absorbers have gained wide consideration, because of their simple processing and striking optoelectronic properties. Although polycrystalline perovskite thin films exhibit phenomenal performance in energy-harvesting devices, they suffer from severe instabilities arising from morphological disorder and surface degradation under ambient conditions. Recent progress in perovskite single-crystals, which, in theory should outperform their polycrystalline thin-film counterparts, has been demonstrated to surmount these challenges, because of the exceptional optoelectronic properties, such as low trap density, high mobility, low intrinsic carrier concentration and long carrier diffusion length. However, most of the growth approaches used for single-crystal syntheses produce very thick crystals and subsequently, the related optoelectronic applications are very limited. Given the potential of perovskite single crystals, to break a new path for perovskite optoelectronic devices relies on understanding sustainable issues arising from interfacial/integration losses and developing passivation strategies to achieve performance parity in an open ambient atmosphere. Therefore, the current review provides a comprehensive overview of the advantages, limitations, and challenges associated with growth methods of single-crystals and their chemical stability, device configurations, photophysics, charge carrier dynamics, and photovoltaic applications.",

In this work, we developed a dual metal atomic catalyst with uniform distributions of two adjacent Cu–Cu or Cu–Ni atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks, featuring distinctive catalytic sites for CO electroreduction. Due to the synergistic effect between adjacent metal sites, the dual Cu–Cu atomic catalyst enables efficient CO electroreduction to C2+ products with an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of ∼91% and a high partial current density over 90 mA·cm–2. In contrast, the dual Cu–Ni atomic catalyst exhibits a remarkably different CO electroreduction selectivity mainly toward CH4. Theoretical calculations suggest that the dual Cu atomic sites facilitate the electroreduction of two CO molecules and subsequent carbon–carbon coupling toward ethylene and acetate, while the replacement of one of the dual Cu atoms with Ni results in too strong CO adsorption, and thus only the single Cu atom functions as the catalytic site for the C1 reduction pathway.",

Combining experimental characterizations and density functional theory (DFT), the excellent performance is ascribed to enhanced intrinsic activity of CoSe2 due to electron transfer from MXene, N doping which lowers the reaction energy barriers, and 3D MXene architecture which provides large specific surface area, high porosity, and good conductivity. Moreover, Zn–air battery equipped with the developed N-CoSe2/3D MXene as the air cathode exhibits better power/energy densities and long-lasting cycling life (over 500 cycles) compared with that of mixed Pt/C and RuO2.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid expansion of electric vehicles and energy storage markets, the rising demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, as opposed to the limited reserves of lithium resources, poses a great challenge to the widespread penetration of this advanced battery technology. Some monovalent metals, such as sodium and potassium, and multivalent metals, such as magnesium, zinc, and aluminum, which are nontoxic and relatively abundant (compared to lithium), are considered as alternative guest ions to lithium ion, thus generating various new battery systems. However, the major obstacle to their large-scale applications has been a lack of suitable robust hosts to accommodate alkalis (Na+, K+) with large radius or multivalent ions (Mg2+, Zn2+, Al3+) with high electrostatic repulsions. Conversion-type materials provide a unique route to tackle this problem because of their special reaction mechanism, which is different from the traditional intercalation reaction, and flexibility for tuning operating voltage. In this Review, the superiority of conversion electrodes for post lithium-ion batteries is discussed in detail, and the recent progress of the newly developed ions batteries based on the conversion mechanism is comprehensively summarized. Finally, the remaining challenges and the perspectives on research directions of conversion electrodes are proposed to provide guidance for future materials engineering and battery design.",

The engineered surface atomic tensile strain is found to favors CO2 adsorption and activation, charge separation, and CO desorption, as well as lowers rate-limiting step energy barrier.

Supercapacitors are critical in developing hybrid energy devices. Amalgamating these high-surface-area frameworks in the capacitor assembly can aid develop robust solid-state supercapacitors. Here, we present supercapacitors drawn on three closely related pyridyl-hydroxyl functionalized COFs. The keto-enol tautomerism and the hydrogen bonding ability of the hydroxyl units promise added chemical stability in this potentially hydrolyzable Schiff-bonded COF. Meanwhile, the pyridyl and triazine groups ensure rapid charge storage by reversibly interacting with protons from the acidic electrolyte. The COF with the highest surface area, as expected, yields an excellent specific capacitance of 546 F/g at 500 mA/g in acidic solution and ∼92 mF/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2 in the solid-state device, which is the highest among all the COF-derived solid-state capacitors, which is reflected by a high power density of 98 μW/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2, most of which is retained even after 10 000 cycles. This high activity comes from a smooth electrical-double-layer-capacitance favored by an ordered-porous structure and some pseudo-capacitance assisted by the participation of redox-active functional groups. The study highlights the by-design development of COFs for superior energy/charge devices.",

The gel-like PVA/PAA adhesives can be conveniently injected and spread on targeted location for firm adhesion of various adherends such as glass, metals, and woods. The PVA/PAA adhesives achieve an adhesion strength of ∼5.9 MPa toward glass substrates and ∼14.3 MPa toward woods. The dried PVA/PAA adhesives are cross-linked with high density of hydrogen bonds between PVA and PAA as well as the physical entanglement of polymer chains, which determines the cohesive force of the adhesives. The adhesive surface has abundant noncomplexed hydroxyl and/or carboxylic acid groups, which can establish hydrogen bonds, coordination bonds, and van der Waals interactions with the surfaces of adherends to enable superstrong adhesion. The incorporation of Laponite RD (Lap) clays can further enhance the adhesion strength of the resultant PVA/PAA-Lap adhesives.

The fundamental challenges in achieving this has been the large anti-Stokes shift combined with the need to efficiently sensitize within the biological transparency window (700–900 nm). This calls for materials combinations with minimal energy losses during sensitization and minimal energy requirements to drive efficient TTA. Here, we demonstrate efficient PUC converting from NIR energy to blue photons using the commercially available material 9,10-bis[((triisopropyl)silyl)ethynyl]anthracene (TIPS-Ac) as the annihilator. With a conventional triplet sensitizing system, TIPS-Ac performed TTA with an efficiency of 77 ± 3% despite a relatively small driving force, compared to conventional TTA material converting from NIR to blue, for the TTA of less than 0.32 eV. Combined with Pt(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphine (PtTPBP), which is a heavy atom triplet sensitizer that directly generates triplets upon NIR photon excitation, the resulting system allowed for an anti-Stokes shift of 1.03 eV. Our results highlight the use of direct triplet generation via NIR excitation as a useful path to achieving large anti-Stokes shift and also show that high TTA efficiencies can be achieved even in the absence of large driving energies for the TTA process.",

    "abstract": "Because of its distinctive combination of physical properties such as high thermal conductivity, ultraviolet (UV) absorbance, or catalytic behavior, zinc oxide-based nanoparticles have attracted interest for the use as fillers to augment a wide range of physicochemical properties of polymer materials, including their optical, dielectric, thermal, and catalytic characteristics. To accomplish the desired property enhancements, precise control of the microstructure of polymer/zinc nanoparticle blends is a prerequisite. This requires the ability to tailor and control the interactions between particle fillers and the polymer matrix. Much progress in the field of polymer/ZnO hybrids has been achieved through the development of surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods that allow for the deliberate modification of zinc oxide surfaces with polymer chains. The ensuing enhancement in particle compatibility has enabled the design of novel multifunctional polymer/ZnO nanocomposite materials. This article surveys recent advances in the application of surface polymerization techniques to enable novel zinc oxide (ZnO)/polymer hybrids. The evolution of synthetic strategies from the pioneering work using \"grafting-from\" to recently developed \"grafting-onto\" and \"templated synthesis\" methods is presented. Subsequently, the opportunities for the design of functional nanocomposite materials based on ZnO hybrids with applications in optics, catalysis, energy, and biomedical areas are being presented. We conclude by highlighting current challenges and opportunities for research in this exciting area of polymer materials research.",

    "abstract": "Electrocatalytic water splitting is considered as a promising route to use renewable energy for hydrogen production; however, its industrial application is limited by the anodic reaction, oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The key solution to unleash this constrain is to find an electrocatalyst that reduces the overpotential (η) of OER. Among the various electrocatalysts, perovskites have attracted intense attention recently for their high OER performance and low cost. To realize the commercial potential of perovskites, understanding its surface chemistry, including leaching, reconstruction, and lattice oxygen participated OER, is crucial to develop the next-generation perovskite catalysts,. In this Review, the perovskite surface stability is emphasized to be closely related to the chemical component of perovskite surface, which can be well controlled by surface engineering and further improves its OER performance. A new descriptor (stability level) is proposed to highlight the relationship between OER performance and surface stability of perovskite. This descriptor will provide potential strategies to optimize OER catalytic performance by tuning surface structure of perovskite.",

There are extensive research efforts investigating lead-free perovskite and perovskite-related compounds, yet there are challenges to synthesize these materials in forms that can be directly integrated into thin film devices rather than as bulk powders. Here, we report on the colloidal synthesis and characterization of lead-free, antifluorite Cs2ZrX6 (X = Cl, Br) nanocrystals that are readily processed into thin films. We use transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction measurements to determine their size and structural properties, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements reveal the presence of oleate ligand, together with a disordered distribution of Cs surface sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal the band structure and fundamental band gaps of 5.06 and 3.91 eV for Cs2ZrCl6 and Cs2ZrBr6, respectively, consistent with experimental values. Finally, we demonstrate that the Cs2ZrCl6 and Cs2ZrBr6 nanocrystal thin films exhibit tunable, broad white photoluminescence with quantum yields of 45% for the latter, with respective peaks in the blue and green spectral regions and mixed systems exhibiting properties between them. Our work represents a critical step toward the application of lead-free Cs2ZrX6 nanocrystal thin films into next-generation light-emitting applications.",

Therefore, the electronic structure engineering of electrocatalysts is an efficient strategic approach to enhance catalytic performances and stabilities. In this review, recent experimental and theoretical advances in the intrinsic electronic structure regulation of TM-based nanomaterials are summarized in terms of preparation methods and underlying natures to boost hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. A systematic discussion is conducted on engineering strategies for TM-based nanomaterials to regulate their electronic structures, optimize their adsorption ability of reaction intermediates, and reduce reaction barrier.

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) suggested that the strength of the Brønsted acidic −OH sites was controlled by the identity of the metal, which resulted in stronger interactions between ammonia and the framework in Ga-PMOF and In-PMOF compared to Al-PMOF.",

However, the study of solid-state molecular motion is still in its infancy, mainly, because of the absence of valid characterization methods. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is a cutting-edge fluorescence technology related to aggregate-state luminescence. Thus, it holds great potential to address this issue. AIE luminogens (AIEgens) are often propeller-like in shape and are, therefore, born with molecular mobility. The emission of AIEgens is determined by molecular motion, and thus, the motion in the solid state can be visualized by fluorescence variation. The active molecular motion of AIEgens promotes nonradiative decay of excitons to release heat in the nanoparticles. This makes AIEgens find application in photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging. In this Viewpoint, we briefly introduce a newly emerging frontier derived from AIE: molecular motion in the solid state with the hope to stimulate new ideas and inspire new endeavors in this area.",

The dialysis in ethanol generates hydrogen-bond-cross-linked PVA-CBA organogels with homogeneous structures while the subsequent dialysis in water leads to PVA-CBA hydrogels uniformly dispersed with hydrogen-bond-cross-linked hydrophobic domains. The in-situ-formed hydrophobic domains with an average diameter of ∼13 nm can strengthen the PVA-CBA hydrogels to a tensile strength of ∼5.8 MPa and toughness of ∼14.9 MJ m–3, and endow the hydrogels with good elasticity. Because of the presence of hydrogen bonds, the hydrophobic domains can reversibly break and reform to enable the rapid and efficient self-healing of fractured hydrogels at room temperature to restore their original mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the hydrogels have good biocompatibility and are potentially useful as post-operative antiadhesive films.",

Taking advantage of the new boronic esters as the cross-linking sites, a series of strong and tough elastomers with outstanding self-healing capacities at room temperature were successfully fabricated. The new design concept provides a novel type of dynamic covalent boronic esters as the platform for synthesizing durable and functional self-healing materials. Moreover, phenol compounds with three hydroxyl groups are abundant in the natural product, tannic acid (TA), which can also form dynamic boronic esters with boronic acid and be used to derive polymers with excellent recyclability. Therefore, this new system might facilitate the commercialization of boron-based dynamic covalent polymers as viable alternatives to contemporary commodity thermosets.",

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), not their high-temperature pyrolysis derived materials, have attracted great attention as electrocatalysts in recent years, because of their large specific surface area, rich pore structure, and uniformly dispersed active sites. Although there are already some review articles focusing on MOFs as electrocatalysts, most of them are mainly based on the applications of MOFs to illustrate their capability and superiority in electrocatalysis. This Review highlights the effective strategies to obtain highly efficient MOFs electrocatalyst from the perspective of material design. Benefitting from the strategies of geometrically structural configuration, coordinatively unsaturated metal sites engineering, metal nodes/ligands optimization, or the electrical conductivity and stability enhancement in the recent progress, MOFs can be improved to exhibit potential for the practical applications in the renewable electrochemical energy conversion systems.",

In this Review, we first introduce the fundamentals of g-C3N4, including molecular structure, electronic structure, and synthesis methods. We then discuss the strategies adopted to extend the optical absorption of g-C3N4 toward longer wavelengths, with a particular emphasis on the use of plasmonic and upconversion materials, as well as on its coupling with narrow-bandgap semiconductors to construct heterojunctions. We then summarize the photocatalytic systems using the three major strategies for photocatalytic applications, especially for NIR photocatalysis. We also point out the limitations of each strategy and potential solutions. Finally, we discuss the challenges in this dynamic research field and provide perspectives for future research.

In this study, a flame-retardant and biosafe i-skin was developed by using silk fibroin and Ca2+ ions as starting materials. The structures, performance, and safety issues of the i-skins were well-balanced. The resultant i-skins not only maintained the advantages of conventional i-skins, such as conductivity, transparency, high stretchability, and self-healing ability, but also featured outstanding flame retardancy and temperature sensibility. With these features, an automated fire alarm system was designed to detect possible fire conditions. Benefiting from their low cost, stretchability, and sustainability, these i-skins are expected to be employed in a range of emerging fields, such as flame-retardant materials, fire alarms, temperature sensors, and human/machine interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal way of generating hydrogen, a renewable energy source, from solar energy that would help solve environmental problems. However, current photocatalysts are far from meeting performance requirements for commercial applications. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enhanced photocatalysis using plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) because of their superior solar energy harvesting capabilities in the visible and near-infrared spectral region. Herein, based on the common CdS photocatalyst, a series of core–shell plasmonic photocatalysts with different core types and shell layer thicknesses were constructed. By combining experimental results and finite element method (FEM), the near-field enhancement mechanism and plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer mechanism was derived. To further improve the energy conversion efficiency, a core–shell–satellite-type plasmonic nanocomposite photocatalyst, Ag@SiO2@CdS-Au, was designed and constructed. Because of hot electron injection and plasmonic coupling effects, the light absorption of the photocatalyst was effectively expanded, which significantly improved the catalytic performance. Compared with traditional CdS, the photocatalytic performance of the plasmonic nanocomposite photocatalyst was improved by more than 200 times. This work deepens the understanding of the mechanisms in SPR enhanced photocatalysis and provides an effective strategy for designing plasmonic photocatalysts.",

Our studies demonstrated that efficient radiative transition pathways were activated for commercial carbazole based luminescence, leading to a large enhancement in PLQY with fluorescence (from 16.0% to 54.4%) and phosphorescence (from <1% to 36.7%) for CzBBr. These results suggest that the origin of carbazole plays a very important role in determining the optical properties of carbazole derivatives, alerting us to carefully revisit carbazole and its derivatives, especially those with record-high efficiency.",

As known from liquid electrolyte-based LIBs, layered oxide cathode materials undergo volume changes upon (de)lithiation, causing mechanical degradation because of particle fracture, among others. Unlike solid electrolytes, liquid electrolytes are somewhat capable of accommodating morphological changes. In SSBs, the rigidity of the materials used typically leads to adverse contact loss at the interfaces of cathode material and solid electrolyte during cycling. Hence, designing zero- or low-strain electrode materials for application in next-generation SSBs is desirable. In the present work, we report on novel Co-rich NCMs, NCM361 (60% Co) and NCM271 (70% Co), showing minor volume changes up to 4.5 V versus Li+/Li, as determined by operando X-ray diffraction and pressure measurements of LIB pouch and pelletized SSB cells, respectively. Both cathode materials exhibit good cycling performance when incorporated into SSB cells using argyrodite Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, albeit their morphology and secondary particle size have not yet been optimized.",

    "abstract": "Designing composites has been a research topic of interest in the field of materials science. As an elegant mathematical representation for composites, the concept of digital materials (DMs) was developed to express structures with complex geometries and various material distributions. DMs have a vast design space to achieve targeted physical properties, which makes it challenging for solving inverse problems. Here, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is utilized to automate the DM design process without the designer's prior knowledge. Based on the reward signal of structural mechanical property changes, DRL algorithms can initiate new design patterns in a self-updating process. As a demonstration example, a DM system composed of two different materials are selected as testing environments with three different levels of design space sizes. The collaborative deep Q network (DQN) architecture is developed to comprise two cooperative agents for two types of element-level modification operations to satisfy the design constraints, such as material fraction. The quality of each composite pattern is calculated through the finite element analysis (FEA) simulation. Results show the proposed approach can effectively handle the complex state-action space problems for the digital material design process with significant computation advantages, compared with those of the genetic algorithm with a 15.9% final design quality enhancement. As such, this new class of DRL scheme could be a powerful tool to enable the autonomous discovery process for next-generation free-form DM designs.",

    "abstract": "Among the lead halide perovskites, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of violet-emitting CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (NCs) is the lowest (<5%). This is an impediment to the development of perovskite-based materials for optical applications covering the entire visible region. While PLQY of the green- and red-emitting perovskites of this class has been raised to near-unity, achieving a similar level for violet- and blue-emitting NCs is still quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel method of simultaneously passivating the surface defects and crystal disorder of violet-emitting CsPbCl3 NCs to dramatically enhance (by a factor of ∼120) the PLQY and stability without affecting the peak wavelength (403 nm) and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the photoluminescence (PL) band. We show that the addition of the correct quantity of CuCl2 during the hot-injection synthesis of CsPbCl3 NCs leads to doping of Cu+ into the NCs, which rectifies octahedral distortion of the crystal and the Cl– passivates the surface; the combined influence of the two results in huge PL enhancement. NCs emitting throughout the blue region (430-460 nm) with near-unity PLQY (92%–98%) can then be obtained by partial halide-exchange of the doped sample. Femtosecond transient absorption studies suggest suppression of the ultrafast carrier trapping process in doped NCs. The results help extending the utility of these materials in optical applications by covering the violet–blue region as well.",

Among various substitute materials, the biocompatible and low-frictional PVA-based hydrogels have revealed their special potential to replace the natural cartilage.

Herein, we designed and prepared a bioinspired hydrogel by combining two cost-effect and biocompatible materials, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and sodium phytate (PANa), which could have superstrong toughness and long-term antiswelling properties in different solutions. The strong hydrogen bonds between PANa and PVA, together with the crystalline microphases of PVA chains, played the major role in offering the physical cross-linking points to give the PVA–PANa gel a dense porous structure. Meanwhile, a compressing process was introduced to the PVA–PANa complex to further strengthen its mechanical properties. Moreover, the introduction of PANa could endow the PVA–PANa gel with good conductivity, which has exhibited a highly sensitive and stable response in strain sensing. This innovative preparation of the high-strength, antiswelling, and conductive hydrogel will open a promising avenue for producing implantable smart biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Delaying ice and frost formation is one of the key strategies to mitigate the hazards induced by ice accretion. The current surfaces for delaying ice formation rely on restricting heterogeneous ice nucleation, which fails in practical application because dust and impurities from the environment can serve as undesired nucleation sites and, thus, promote ice nucleation. Herein, ionogel surfaces are prepared to not only inhibit ice nucleation but also control ice growth. At −20 °C, the prepared surface enables an unconventional inward ice growth from the water droplet–air interface, resulting in a spherical cap ice rather than a normal pointy cap ice. Both experiments and molecular simulations confirm that the prepared ionogel surface can efficiently generate an interfacial liquid layer thanks to the inward ice growth and the presence of ionic liquid. Such non-frozen interfacial liquid layer is desired for lowering ice adhesion and preventing frost formation. Consequently, the ionogel surface exhibits exceptional anti-frost abilities under cold humid environment (−20 °C, importing gas 60% RH at 20 °C).",

    "abstract": "Because of the versatility of plasmonic nanoparticles, there have been major improvements in tailoring the plasmonic effects for a plethora of applications. However, a major bottleneck of plasmonic platforms is the poor performance for nonadsorbing molecules because the plasmon-induced properties are strongest only at the plasmonic surface. To address this fundamental challenge, porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly incorporated with plasmonic nanoparticles (NP) platform to form plasmonic NP–MOF nanohybrid. Integrating porous MOFs with plasmonic NP enhances the applicability of the nanohybrid by allowing each material to complement each other and can give rise to additional functionalities. In this Perspective, we discuss the latest progress in the development of NP–MOF nanohybrid platforms. We focus on the strategies to fabricate different types of NP–MOF nanohybrids, and their corresponding properties and characteristics, which dictate their subsequent applications. We highlight how the combinative strengths of each material can achieve multiplicative and synergistic breakthrough in current and emerging plasmonic applications, including chemical sensing using LSPR, SERS, and SEIRA, driving and monitoring gas–liquid reactions, probing interactions at the NP–MOF interface, MOF- and plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis, and chemo-photothermal therapy. Finally, we conclude our discussion and present a critical outlook that explores the challenges and future opportunities in the design and applications of NP–MOF nanohybrids.",

To prevent ice accretion, various materials have been developed in the past decade. In this Review, three kinds of ice accretion prevention methods, namely, active deicing, passive anti-icing, and the combination of both were summarized. By reducing water droplet retention time, decreasing the icing point, and inhibiting ice nucleus formation on the surface or suppressing ice formation through special macro–micro physicochemical structures, etc., passive anti-icing was realized. Endowing the material surfaces with low surface energy feature, impregnated lubricants or peculiar elastic modulus, etc., effectively promoted active deicing performance. Some multifunctional materials, such as photothermal or electric–thermal hydrophobic materials, have both anti-icing and deicing properties, and icing can be prevented perfectly by external energy, which was adaptable to the mutable natural environment.

In this study, hierarchically structured nitrogen-doped carbon microspheres (CMSs) are synthesized for use as electrodes in a potassium ion battery (PIBs). Compared to traditional carbon nanomaterials, the CMSs possess rich internal structure, which not only provide additional active sites and better electron transport but also mitigate the volume expansion related challenges caused by potassium ion intercalation. As the anode material for PIBs, the CMSs could deliver high reversible discharge capacities of 328 and 125 mAh g–1 at 100 and 3000 mA g–1, respectively. Moreover, the CMSs anodes also exhibit durable cycling performance with a remaining capacity of 136 mAh g–1 even after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 2000 mA g–1. Notably, a full cell assembled with the CMSs anode and an organic cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical characteristics with 78% capacity retention after 1900 cycles at 500 mA g–1, and high energy and power densities of 141Wh kg–1 and 4382 W kg–1, respectively. Considering the rich microstructure of CMSs and their facile synthesis method, this study delineates the merits of employing CMSs in battery applications over other electrode materials.",

    "abstract": "Bulk-type solid-state batteries (SSBs) constitute a promising next-generation technology for electrochemical energy storage. However, in order for SSBs to become competitive with mature battery technologies, (electro)chemically stable, superionic solid electrolytes are much needed. Multicomponent or high-entropy lithium argyrodites have recently attracted attention for their favorable material characteristics. In the present work, we report on increasing the configurational entropy of the Li6+aP1–xMxS5I solid electrolyte system and examine how this affects the structure-conductivity/stability relationships. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and 7Li pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, multicationic substitution is demonstrated to result in a very low activation energy for Li diffusion of ∼0.2 eV and a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of ∼13 mS cm–1 (for Li6.5[P0.25Si0.25Ge0.25Sb0.25]S5I). The transport properties are rationalized from a structural perspective by means of complementary neutron powder diffraction and magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy measurements. The Li6.5[P0.25Si0.25Ge0.25Sb0.25]S5I solid electrolyte was also tested in high-loading SSB cells with a Ni-rich layered oxide cathode and found by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to suffer from interfacial side reactions during cycling. Overall, the results of this study indicate that optimization of conductivity is equally important to optimization of stability, and compositionally complex lithium argyrodites represent a new playground for a rational design of (potentially advanced) superionic solid electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly active and reliable photocatalysts for solar hydrogen (H2) production requires the thorough and in-depth understanding of the atomic-level structure/composition-performance relationship in photocatalysts. In this contribution, we for the first time develop a new and simple technique to prepare the ReS2 ultrathin nanosheets (UNSs) with massive atomic-level edge sites. The atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy integrated with density functional theory (DFT) based computations predicts that these atomic-level edge sites can efficiently boost H2 evolution. Hence, the as-synthesized ReS2 UNSs are coupled with the three most extensively explored photocatalysts, i.e., TiO2, CdS, and melon, for apparently enhanced photocatalytic H2 production. Particularly, the TiO2 decorated ReS2 UNS exhibits a significantly improved photocatalytic H2-production rate of 1037 μmol h–1 g–1, 129.6 times larger than that of bare TiO2. Moreover, the TiO2/ReS2 composites were investigated by both DFT-based calculations and state-of-art characterizations, e.g., synchrotron radiation based X-ray absorption near edge structure and transient-state surface photovoltage/photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results indicate that the abundant atomic-level edge active sites of ReS2 UNSs greatly advance the H2 evolution while their relatively intact basal planes rapidly transfer the electrons to those edge active sites. Besides, the notable electronic coupling between ReS2 and TiO2 remarkably accelerates the dissociation/migration of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Our work not only affords the atomic-level insights into the edge active sites of ReS2 UNSs in the photocatalysis field but also pave new avenues to the engineering of atomic-level reactive sites on two-dimensional materials for solar energy conversion.",

Using a combination of electrochemical quartz microbalance gravimetry and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, we show that charge compensation during polymer redox processes proceeds via a cation-dependent mechanism. For p-type polymer oxidation in certain electrolytes, charge compensation is achieved by both eventual injection of anions into the film, as well as initial expulsion of cations from the film. We compare doping mechanisms for a variety of electrolyte salts including potassium chloride, tetrabutylammonium chloride, potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6), and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. For the electrolyte KPF6, both the cations and anions coexist in the water-swelled polymer even prior to application of electrical bias. Our data indicate that electrochemical doping (hole injection into the polymer and ionic charge compensation) proceeds via the following mechanism: (1) hydration of the neutral film by electrolyte (water, cations, anions), (2) cation (K+) expulsion from the film upon initial application of an oxidative bias, and (3) anion injection into the film at higher oxidation/doping levels (>∼2 × 1020/cm3). Understanding the mechanism of charge compensation during the doping process should allow for the design of improved mixed ionic/electronic conductors for use in applications ranging from organic supercapacitors and redox flow batteries to bioelectronic sensors, thermoelectrics, and devices for neuromorphic computing.",

In this Review, our aim is to highlight the current status of the research on Janus interface materials with special emphasis on wettability contrast. In the first section, a brief history of the literature on Janus-type materials and interfaces, materials possessing different chemistries or topographies on opposing sites, is introduced. In the second section, theories behind wetting, including “wettability integration”, are summarized, which can be regarded as the combination of opposing wetting properties within the same material. Afterwards, natural examples of Janus interfaces, a branch of superwettability integration, are discussed, which inspired the researchers to mimic the nature and develop artificial analogues. In the next section, the current status on artificial Janus interfaces with wettability contrast are reviewed, subcategories for which are implemented according to the (possible) application areas and also the origin of their base substrates. Then, the inorganic and organic based artificial Janus interfaces were compared in terms of advantages and disadvantages. Finally, a conclusion and outlook are given.",

It has been believed that light does not affect the stability of zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-8 (ZIF-8), one of the most stable MOFs. Herein, we report for the first time that the hydrolysis-based decomposition of ZIF-8 in water is accelerated by the irradiation of UVA, UVB, and near-UV visible light. The action spectrum of photo-accelerated decomposition is identical with the optical absorption spectrum of ZIF-8, suggesting that the photo-accelerated decomposition is not due to the decomposition by-products but related to the ligand-based photo-absorption in ZIF-8. Future research directions to elucidate the cause of photo-accelerated decomposition are discussed.

    "abstract": "Insufficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole and feeble CO2 activation remain the main obstacles in the access to high-performance CO2 reduction nowadays. Single-atom active sites engineering could be an efficient method through simultaneously promoting charge separation and CO2 activation. Herein, a model of Bi4O5I2 with single-atom Fe implanting and accompanying Bi decorating on surface is proposed to boost the performance. The single-atom Fe implantation decreases the value of surface work function, allowing the fast transition of photon-generated electrons from the surface of catalyst to CO2 molecule. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, CO2 adsorption measurements, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and efficient CO2 activation are realized on as-established single-atom catalyst. An exceptional yield of CO (23.77 μmol g–1 h–1) and CH4 production (4.98 μmol g–1 h–1) is acquired over optimized Bi4O5I2–Fe30 with 1.09 wt % of single-atom Fe, superior to Bi4O5I2, and most other reported photocatalysts. The work paves a insight into rational design of photocatalysts toward simultaneously facilitating carrier separation and CO2 activation from the angle of atom single metal.",

    "abstract": "Localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) have captured considerable attention, since they retain the merits of high-concentration electrolytes while circumventing the disadvantages of high viscosity and high costs. Herein, a systematic comparison between two representative LHCEs (i.e., dimethyl carbonate (DMC)-based LHCE and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)-based LHCE) in high-voltage Li metal batteries was performed. The results showed that DME-based LHCE possesses better compatibilty with Li metal anodes than DMC-based LHCE, and the underlying mechanism is clarified from the point of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. The two representative LHCEs showed comparable reductive stability, while Li+–DME showed better reductive stability than Li+–DMC. This means the more prominent decomposition of anions in DME-based LHCE, since SEI is derived from the competitive decomposition products of solvents and anions, which is further verified by the more-complete anion decomposition products found in SEI formed in DME-based LHCE. The inorganic-rich SEI with superior passivating ability is reponsible for the good compatibility of DME-based LHCE with Li metal anodes. The findings in this study provides fresh understandings on the stable nature of ether-based LHCE with Li metal anodes, which can serve as guidelines for advanced electrolytes engineering.",

Here, a type of transition metal carbide (Ti3C2 MXene)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) biomimetic hydrogels are manufactured via an ice-templated freezing followed by salting-out approach. In addition to high electrical conductivity and mechanical strength as well as ultraflexibility, a honeycomb-like aligned porous structure is successfully achieved. Thanks to the synergistic interactions among MXene, PVA, water, and biomimetic porous structure, the thin hydrogels show an excellent X-band electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of 57 dB at a merely 0.86 vol % MXene content. EMI SE more than 50 dB in the ultrabroadband frequencies of 8.2–40 GHz, covering typical GHz frequency ranges, is accomplished. More importantly, via in situ controlling the water contents of the hydrogels, a quantitative influence of the water on EMI shielding performance was ascertained. Furthermore, a good strain sensing performance of the ultraflexible, wearable hydrogel contributes to the sensitive and reliable detections of human motions and smart coding. This work thus suggests an avenue for preparing robust, flexible, and multifunctional MXene-based biomimetic hydrogels toward high-performance EMI shields and wearable strain sensors.",

    "abstract": "Portable water filters are crucial to water purification for household or community scale usage and are especially popular in developing countries or remote areas without water treatment plants. However, commercial filters face many challenges, such as slow adsorption rates, limited throughput, and the use of expensive materials and sophisticated fabrication methods, hindering their wide application for improved water quality and health. Here, we report a highly efficient water filter directly derived from abundant wood material using a facile carbonization and activation process. The massive, vertically aligned channels found naturally in the carbonized wood enable the fast and high throughput water flow while the pollutants are effectively absorbed on the nanoporous channel walls with a high surface area imparted from the activation process. Therefore, as a proof-concept study, the three-dimensional (3D)-activated wood filter demonstrates a high adsorption capacity (198.64 mg g–1) and adsorption rate (99.52% in 5 min) for Methylene Blue, superior to that of commercial filters. In addition, the bulk filter can be thermally regenerated for recycled usage by a simple carbonization process. This outstanding performance, combined with the natural abundance of wood materials, facile and scalable fabrication process, and substantially lower cost, positions our 3D-activated wood filter as a highly efficient and sustainably sourced replacement for portable commercial filters, particularly for developing countries with a pressing need for clean water.",

Many recent studies have considered new adsorbents to remove these emerging contaminants from water resources, including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), porous organic polymers (POPs), porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), porous cyclodextrin-based polymers, and many others. These materials systems incorporate elements of molecular design to target specific pollutants, and many have porosity and high surface areas that provide rapid uptake and high capacity. Although they represent timely and important advances in materials design and synthesis, the characterization of their adsorption performance is sometimes not relevant for water treatment, insufficient, or implemented in ways that prevent comparison to the state-of-the-art materials. This Perspective scrutinizes common practices in the recent literature and provides guidance for designing conclusive and effective adsorption experiments with novel adsorbents. Efforts to adhere to these best practices will allow researchers to evaluate novel adsorbents effectively and will facilitate the emergence of general design criteria for the removal of emerging contaminants from water. Proper experimental design can give crucial insights for understanding adsorption mechanisms, as well as enabling comparisons among different studies, which will better contribute to solving current and future water quality problems.",

    "abstract": "Developing stretchable/wearable strain sensors in different application scenarios is a global demand for creating a smart society and promoting healthcare, whereas existing hydrogel-based strain sensors suffer from limited sensitivity, low conductance and hydrophilicity, making them difficult to operate underwater. In this work, a highly sensitive, stretchable, and hydrophobic strain sensor is fabricated by coating a layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets on the surface of organohydrogel. Furthermore, a facile solvent-replacement approach is utilized to enhance the anti-freezing and anti-drying abilities of hydrogel simultaneously by incorporating propanediol in the solvent. Consequently, the obtained rGO-organohydrogel composite strain sensor features a high gauge factor of 140, a low detection limit of 0.1% strain, a wide detection range (0–400% strain), a fast response time of 190 ms, excellent stability and repeatability, and high hydrophobicity (contact angle of 122°), making it applicable for a wide range of application scenarios, such as the real-time and continuous monitoring of various human motions in extremely cold (−60 °C), dry, and underwater environments. The sensitivity of an rGO-modified organohydrogel strain sensor is more than 30 times higher than that of its unmodified counterpart, which is attributed to the cracking and tunneling effects introduced by the highly conductive rGO surface layer upon stretching.",

Here, we report optical band gaps of common MOFs and demonstrate that Gaussian fitting is more appropriate for assigning accurate gap energies. We further support this claim with DFT simulation, providing a reliable method for estimating optical band gaps from ground-state hybrid-GGA. MOFs that require Tauc analysis exhibit overlapping optical transitions uncommon for typical carboxylate-based MOFs and more akin to narrow-gap semiconductors. Taken together, these results provide a simple roadmap for assigning MOF optical band gaps.",

However, the shuttle effect of highly soluble I3– in zinc–iodine batteries leads to a rapid decrease in capacity and Coulomb efficiency during cycling, which seriously hinders their further development and application. Here, we developed an in situ synthesis of an aqueous fast-charging and ultrastable Zn–I2 battery cathode materials composed of mesoporous carbon and I2. Compounding I2 with highly conductive carbon is an effective method to facilitate electron and ion transport and confine polyiodides/I– conversion reaction inside pores, thereby eliminating polyiodides shuttle effect, which greatly improves cycling stability of Zn–I2 batteries. The developed Zn–I2 battery provides a specific capacity of 90 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1, excellent multiplicative performance, and retains a capacity retention of 80.6% over an ultralong period of 39 000 cycles at 10 A g–1, superior to previously reported Zn–I2 batteries. Furthermore, Zn–I2 pouch cell retained 89% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g–1. This work undoubtedly sets a precedent for ultralong cycle life Zn–I2 battery cathode materials and provides an important solution and pathway for the assembly of I2-based materials suitable for high-performance aqueous energy technologies.",

    "abstract": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with metal–nitrogen (M–N) moiety are effective in boosting the redox kinetics of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. However, the precise preparation of SACs with controllable M–N coordination number remains challenging and the relationship between M–N coordination number and polysulfide redox kinetics is still unexplored. Herein, a novel exfoliation-evaporation strategy assisted by molten salt is proposed to fabricate Co SACs (named Co–Nx) with different N coordination numbers for Li–S batteries. The key of this strategy is to exfoliate layered Co-based ZIF-L precursors into N-doped graphene with abundant dispersed Co atoms by molten salt and then control Co–N coordination number by selectively introducing Zn evaporation to promote C–N fragments release. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that highly unsaturated Co–N2 with asymmetric electron distribution immobilizes LiPSs, accelerates LiPSs conversion, and promotes Li2S deposition/dissociation more effectively than Co–N4 through stronger chemical interactions. As a result, Co–N2 endows Li–S batteries with long cycle life (0.05% capacity decay per cycle for 700 cycles), excellent rate capability (687 mAh g–1 at 5 C), and high areal capacity of 8.2 mAh cm–2 at a high loading of 7.0 mg cm–2. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate SACs with controllable N coordination number and establishes the relationship between M–N coordination number and LiPSs redox kinetics, motivating future rational design of SACs for high-performance Li–S batteries.",

Therefore, these emitters have recently attracted great interest for application in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The compositional diversity of MR-TADF materials is, however, limited to the use mainly of nitrogen and oxygen as electron-rich heteroatoms. Here, we expand the chemical range of these materials by considering the replacement of the O atoms with either S or Se atoms, with the objective of enhancing spin–orbit coupling via the heavy-atom effect. We theoretically evaluate the influence of these substitutions on the emissive properties. We investigate three series of MR molecules with structural motifs based on the following: (i) DOBNA (5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracene); (ii) OAB-ABP (5,12-dioxa-8b-aza-16b,19b-diboraanthra[1,9-ab]benzo[j]perylene); and (iii) the variation of the positions of the chalcogen atoms within the OAB-ABP framework. The results of highly correlated quantum-chemical calculations show that the chemical nature and positions of the chalcogen atoms have a crucial impact on the photophysical properties. Several of the molecules incorporating sulfur or selenium are found to exhibit both high-energy emissive states and large reverse intersystem crossing rates, which makes them promising candidates as efficient deep-blue emitters.",

Intriguing properties like high conductivity, wear, and corrosion resistance while maintaining flexibility are the strong motivation behind the exploration of MXenes. Moreover, the large surface area and unique layered structure enhance the functionality of multilayer-MXene heterostructures and hybrids. This paper reviews the synthesis chemistry, structure properties of multilayer MXenes, and their multifunctional applications. MXene synthesis under different conditions, their hybrids and composites, intercalation, and structural geometries are discussed.

Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements displayed that the COF was an effective photocatalyst for generating ROS with one unpaired electron, that is, superoxide radical anion (O2• –).

Herein, a novel NCS Bi-based thiophosphate RbBiP2S6 (P21) has been successfully designed by the aliovalent substitution of centrosymmetric Rb4P2S6 (P21/c).

Moreover, detailed structure analysis and theoretical studies indicate that the superior IR-NLO performance can be attributed to the highly polarizable [BiS7] units together with the favorable alignment of ethane-like [P2S6] units.

    "abstract": "The establishment of highly permanent porosity in hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is a long-standing challenge due to the fragile nature of hydrogen bonds, which delimits their broad applications in gas separation. Herein, we report a novel diamondoid HOF (termed as ZJU-HOF-10) and utilize the supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2) drying method to significantly improve its permanent porosity for highly boosting ethane/ethylene (C2H6/C2H4) separation. Compared with the commonly used heat/vacuum activation, the sc-CO2 activated ZJU-HOF-10(sc) exhibits a significantly improved BET surface area of 1169 m2 g–1 over 295 m2 g–1. Such enhanced porosity in ZJU-HOF-10(sc) thus leads to a notably increased C2H6 uptake capacity (1.65 mmol g–1 at 296 K and 0.5 bar) and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (1.9), both of which are comparable to those of the benchmark HOF-76a reported (1.69 mmol g–1 and 2.0). Theoretical calculations reveal that the inherent feature of nonpolar pore surfaces in ZJU-HOF-10(sc) plays the key role to result in stronger multipoint interactions with C2H6 over C2H4. Actual breakthrough experiments affirm that ZJU-HOF-10(sc) is capable of efficiently separating ethane from 50/50 (v/v) or 10/90 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at ambient conditions, affording a high polymer-grade C2H4 productivity of 6.9 or 13.1 L kg–1, respectively.",

Graphene materials as electrodes, on the one hand, can actively take part in the electrochemical reactions.

The precursors of amorphous carbon black and urea are quickly converted into high-quality FNG in less than 1 s under a short electrical pulse with a bright flash of blackbody radiation.

An integrated proximity and tactile pressure sensor, with the capability to continuously perceive the approach of an object until a pressure variation is sensed through contact and manipulation, is in demand for the improvement of proximity-sensing distance, flexibility, and integration. Herein, capacitive proximity and pressure dual-mode sensors based on a novel complementary Archimedean spiral electrode design and dielectric calcium cross-linked alginate film are reported. The results of theoretical analysis and finite element simulation show that the electrode pattern design with a higher specific fringe length (i.e., fringe length divided by electrode cover area) significantly enhances the fringe field. As the dielectric layer, the flexible and transparent calcium cross-linked alginate film with crater-shaped morphology is prepared by a novel interfacial reaction method with ultrasonic spraying that improves the sensitivity and linearity of the tactile perception response. Sensors with optimized electrodes and dielectric layers exhibit unprecedented performance in terms of high sensitivity, long detection distance (∼55 mm), fast responding time (<10 ms), and highly linear response (R2 = 0.995). Furthermore, the applications of the integrated perception sensors for noncontact tapping and swiping gesture recognition and continuous human–machine interaction for controlling image scaling are demonstrated.",

Nevertheless, the effect of entropy on the lithium transport remains largely elusive. Here, we report, for the first time, about medium- and high-entropy polyanionic lithium superionic conductors crystallizing in the F–43m space group and adopting the so-called argyrodite structure. The Li6PS5[Cl0.33Br0.33I0.33], Li6P[S2.5Se2.5][Cl0.33Br0.33I0.33], and Li6.5[Ge0.5P0.5][S2.5Se2.5][Cl0.33Br0.33I0.33] materials were structurally characterized using complementary synchrotron and neutron scattering techniques in combination with 31P magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that, in contrast to other high-entropy ceramics, an unequal distribution of elements over the respective crystallographic sites occurs in these materials. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and 7Li pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that introducing entropy (compositional disorder) marginally affects the room-temperature ionic conductivity (∼10–3 S cm–1) but instead lowers the activation energy for conduction to 0.22 eV. Our results emphasize the possibility of increasing entropy in polyanionic materials, thereby opening up compositional space for the search of Li-ion conductors with unprecedented properties.",

In contrast with functional devices constructed over elastomer films with limited moisture permeability, a soft electronic textile may represent the ideal skin-attachable platform to achieve long-term wearing comfort. The advancements in this active area largely hinge on a new generation of permeable conductor. Despite its intrinsic mechanical deformability, gallium-based liquid metal typically represents an impenetrable barrier for gases and liquids. In this study, we introduce a liquid metal micromesh on electrospun microfiber textile as a highly permeable and ultrastretchable conductor. The fabrication process involves dropcasting liquid metal onto an elastomeric microfiber textile followed by high-speed rotation to remove the excessive coating. The liquid metal micromesh exhibits low sheet resistance (0.38 Ω/sq), ultrahigh stretchability (>1000% strain), and mechanical durability. The porous morphology enables a high steam permeability and perception of comfort comparable to those of standard textiles. The conformal interface with the skin gives rise to low contact impedance better than that of state-of-the-art Ag/AgCl gel electrodes. The successful implementation of the liquid micromesh conductor in a multifunctional electronic system demonstrates its practical suitability for a broad range of applications in stretchable and wearable electronics.",

    "abstract": "Electrolyte solvation chemistry has attracted great attention since the recent discovery of its effect on the performances of metal-ion batteries. However, it is challenging to discern its decisive influence from the well-known effect of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. This issue becomes more complex upon introducing additives into the electrolyte, as the key role of additives in forming the SEI layer or changing the electrolyte solvation structure also become hard to be discerned. Herein, we design a new dimethyl ether-based electrolyte, and then we unravel the effects of solvation chemistry and the SEI on determining electrode performances, such as the antimony (Sb) anode as a promising example for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We find that both the unique solvation structure-derived interfacial model and the SEI are necessary to stabilize the Sb anode. The influences of electrolyte components, particularly the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate additive, were elucidated for the first time by the dynamic molecular behaviors ranging from solvation structure, interfacial model, to microstructure of the SEI. Finally, extremely high performance of the Sb anode with the capacity of 668 mAh g–1, high-rate performance over 5 A g–1, and long cycle life over 100 cycles are obtained, which is superior to that previously reported. This work provides a comprehensive guideline for designing electrolytes via a synergetic approach of solvation structure and the SEI aspects.",

    "abstract": "It remains a formidable challenge to fabricate degradable plastics that are recyclable, easy for processing and safe for use in seawater. In this study, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based supramolecular plastics capable of degrading in soil and recycling under mild conditions are fabricated by grafting 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA) onto PVA chains (hereafter denoted as PVA-CBA). The PVA-CBA plastics are dynamically cross-linked with a high density of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen-bond-cross-linked hydrophobic domains. The PVA-CBA plastics exhibit a yield strength of ∼84 MPa, which remains to be ∼40 MPa when the plastic is fully immersed in water. The satisfactory mechanical strength of the PVA-CBA plastics in watery environment originates from the hydrogen-bond-cross-linked hydrophobic domains comprised of CBA groups connected with PVA segments. Benefiting from the reversibility of hydrogen bonds, the PVA-CBA plastics can be conveniently processed to obtain products of desired shapes and are also recyclable under mild conditions for repeated usage. Importantly, the PVA-CBA plastics are autonomously and completely degradable in soil. In seawater, the PVA-CBA plastics can rapidly fragment into extremely soft, tiny and nontoxic hydrogel pieces that are safe to marine animals. Moreover, the PVA-CBA plastic bags can preserve the freshness of fruit much better than polyethylene bags.",

To satisfy the above requirements, novel multifunctional microwave absorption aerogels based on a multilevel structural design and host–guest heterointerface engineering strategy are reported herein, in which a freeze–thaw-assembled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel as a host is confined in an in-situ-generated guest, bridged polysilsesquioxane (BPSi) aerogel. The resulting host–guest rGO-BPSi aerogel achieves a minimal reflection loss of −51.2 dB with a broad effective absorption bandwidth of 8.4 GHz at a low filling ratio (6.2 wt %), which is attributed to the enhanced impedance matching of the gradient composition, various dielectric losses, and multiple scattering occurring within hierarchically porous structures. Furthermore, the excellent structural robustness and machinability, as well as the superhydrophobicity, thermal insulation, and antifreezing performance, guarantee the stable and durable microwave absorption application of the aerogel and resistance against deformation, water, humidity, and cold and hot environments. This design integrates multiple functionalities into a host–guest aerogel-in-aerogel system, providing valuable insights for the creation of advanced functional aerogels for diverse applications.",

However, huge pressure changes during cycling will lead to the pulverization of the 2D lithium anode, thus deteriorating the battery life due to its poor mechanical strength. Herein we report a 3D lithium–boron (LiB) fibrous framework with great compressive strength through electrochemical delithiation. The LiB alloy fibers with a 3D stable structure play the role of an expansion-tolerant substrate, which could effectively hold the Li metal and reduce the internal pressure changes, showing only a 53.7% pressure change compared with the 2D Li/Cu-anode-based pouch cell. A quasi-ionic-liquid-based polymer electrolyte layer is introduced by a scalable tape-casting method, generating a LiF-rich layer inside the 3D Li anode through the reaction between the polymer electrolyte and the internal free Li, which can guide the uniform nucleation and growth of Li metal. As a result, the asymmetric Li–Li cell can sustain 5 mAh cm–2 Li plating/stripping for 1000 h. A 2.1 Ah pouch cell coupling to a LiF-rich interface-protected 3D Li/LiB anode and a Ni-rich cathode of 30 mg cm–2 exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 403 Wh kg–1 and a stable cycle life of 100 cycles.",

    "abstract": "Zero-dimensional (0D) copper-based metal halides have exhibited great potential as luminescent materials with structural tunability and impressive emission properties. Luminescence from highly ordered self-assembly of copper halides is typically characterized by high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) and large Stokes shifts, which are the most attractive features for active optical waveguides. Here, we report a novel highly luminescent organic copper halide, (PTMA)3Cu3I6 (PTMA: phenyltrimethylammonium), in which individual face- and edge-sharing [Cu3I6]3– clusters are surrounded by PTMA+ organic molecules, forming a highly ordered 0D crystal structure at the molecular level. Upon photoexcitation, (PTMA)3Cu3I6 single crystals exhibit a broadband yellow emission with a high PLQE of up to 80.3%. Theoretical calculations revealed that the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in (PTMA)3Cu3I6 are spatially separated from each other, i.e., electrons are preferred to be localized in PTMA+ organic molecules, while holes are highly localized in the inorganic [Cu3I6]3– clusters; thus, the emission arises from the radiative recombination of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). In addition, colloidal nanocrystals of (PTMA)3Cu3I6 were successfully prepared, which show similar luminescence properties with their single crystals. The high PLQE, negligible self-absorption as well as the highly ordered self-assembly of metal halide clusters make (PTMA)3Cu3I6 microplates promising materials for low-loss optical waveguides, exhibiting an optical loss coefficient of 0.0157 dB μm–1 and highly linear polarized luminescence with a polarization anisotropy of 1.78.",

In contrast to inorganic counterparts, organic semiconductors exhibit favorable attributes including solution processability, tailorable spectral response, mechanical flexibility, and nontoxicity. However, nowadays NIR organic photodetectors (OPDs) suffer from the scarcity of narrow-bandgap organic materials, low NIR responsivity, and a large dark current. Herein, we developed a novel narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor, PDTTYM, and fabricated four OPD devices based on PDTTYM matched with four different polymer donors, which exhibited remarkable responsivities approaching 0.5 A W–1 in the NIR region ranging from 890 to 910 nm. By adjusting the bulk-heterojunction layer thicknesses in four OPD devices, we optimized the dark current densities (Jds) and the external quantum efficiencies of devices to get the optimized devices. Furthermore, we use Mott–Schottky analysis to evaluate the charge doping densities and depletion widths of four devices, which may explain the different dark current characteristics of our OPDs. All four optimized OPDs exhibit large specific detectivities around 1012 Jones for the NIR spectral region ranging from 780 to 1050 nm, which is close to that of a conventional commercial Si-based photodetector.",

    "abstract": "Stimuli-responsive fluorescent materials have recently been developed and employed as fluorescent security inks for applications in the fields of high-level security protection and multi-anticounterfeiting because they can provide extra security features by switching luminescence outputs in response to external stimuli. However, conventional stimuli-responsive fluorescent inks are generally limited to unicolor or dual-color fluorescent response behaviors in monotonous stimuli mode, resulting in being comparatively less effective for advanced anticounterfeiting applications. Herein, we report a new strategy for constructing a dual stimuli-responsive multicolor security ink, which is based on the integration of the near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive orthogonal three-primary-color luminescence properties of upconversion nanoparticles and pH-sensitive color-changing behavior of thymolphthalein dye. Unlike most other invisible security inks, this new dual stimuli-responsive security ink can realize visualization of hidden information. The information recorded by this ink is initially visible under natural light and then spontaneously becomes invisible within several tens of seconds. The feature of disappearance in seconds allows customers to check and correct concealed information before hiding it. In addition, upon pH stimulation, the concealed information can be reversibly interconverted between visible and invisible states. Meanwhile, upon ternary NIR quadrature excitation (808/980/1560 nm), the information can emit intense green, blue, and red fluorescence, respectively. More importantly, the information printed with the security ink exhibits robust stability against various chemical treatments, which demonstrates great potential for practical applications in advanced anticounterfeiting.",

At present, the application of supercapacitors is more and more extensive, which requires them to face various complex environments. However, MSCs applied under high-temperature conditions have not been reported. In this paper, the MXene–V2O5–polyaniline (MVP) ternary composite material is used as the electrode material, and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (SPBI) is used as the solid electrolyte to design high-temperature MSCs for the first time. The preparation of MVP is achieved by introducing V2O5 into the MXene layer and loading polyaniline (PANI) on its surface, which not only greatly improves the capacitance performance of the electrode but also ensures its stability at a high temperature. The capacitance value of the MVP electrode was as high as 3180 mF cm–3 (880 F g–1), with excellent mechanical properties and increased flexibility at the same time. Furthermore, the assembled supercapacitor has a high energy density of 79.2 Wh L–1 (22.1 Wh kg–1). Moreover, its capacitance value can reach 985.3 mF cm–3 (276 F g–1) at 120 °C.

We demonstrate how atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to provide molecular scale insight into the role of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the adsorption of the perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) surfactant, a prominent longer-chain PFAS, on a polymer-based network in water. Specifically, the adsorption of ammonium perfluorooctanoate salt has been investigated on the β-cyclodextrin (CD) network cross-linked with decafluorobiphenyl linkers as an example of an absorbent material that has already demonstrated efficient PFAS adsorption. Examination of pairwise interactions reveals the importance of the dual pronged adsorption mechanism involving both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The adsorption of ammonium counterions on the CD segments facilitates attraction of the anionic headgroup of the PFOA surfactant, while fluorinated linkers provide an additional hydrophobic attraction for the PFOA tail as well as higher affinity of the network toward PFOA in comparison with hydrocarbons. These competing interactions result in PFOA adsorption primarily outside of the CD cavity with the PFOA tail mostly interacting with fluorinated linkers. We demonstrate that simulations using \"what if\" scenarios are a powerful approach to infer the role of different interactions in the adsorption of PFAS.",

Its generation, however, strongly depends on the frequency conversion of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Currently, KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) is sole material that can produce the DUV coherent light by direct second-harmonic generation (SHG), i.e., sixth harmonic generation of Nd:YAG (1064 nm/6 = 173 nm). The strong layering growth habit, and the highly toxicity of BeO make the safe growth of KBBF a great challenge. In this communication, we report the first chemically benign DUV three-dimensional mixed-coordinated borophosphate Rb3B11P2O23 (RBPO). This material inherits all the excellent structural genes of KBBF and achieves comparable optical properties, such as a large SHG response (2.5 × KDP; 1.2 × KDP for KBBF), short absorption edge (168 nm; 147 nm for KBBF) and suitable birefringence (0.071@1064 nm; 0.077@1064 nm for KBBF). More importantly, RBPO melts congruently and can overcome all the processing limitations of KBBF. Theoretical calculations and structure analysis reveal that its superior optical properties can be attributed to the KBBF-like [B4P2O11]∞ layers, where NLO-active B3O7 groups adopt a coplanar configuration with well-ordered arrangement. These indicate RBPO will be the new generation of DUV NLO crystal.",

The current robot is not only the smallest and fastest among the reported DEA-driven robots but also obtains high robustness, good environmental adaptability, and impact-perception capability: It can run on various grounds and complex paths, climb inside small pipes, work in robot swarms, and sustain and perceive the impact of the external environment.",

Herein, a promising concept was put forward by lowering the energy of the lowest triplet excited state (T1) of the photosensitizer below the threshold for oxygen sensitization via maximizing the electronic exchange energy. By taking advantage of the low energy intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state, pyrrolidine as an electron donor is conjugated at the bay position of perylenediimide (PDI) to produce PDIPy that acts as a novel photosensitizer with NIR absorbance and low T1 energy level. With the application of PDIPy, Type-I PDT is realized via effective generation of O2• –. Supramolecular nanoparticles (NanoPDIPy) assembling from PDIPy showed excellent in vitro and in vivo phototherapeutic efficacy against cancer in either normoxia or hypoxia upon 730 nm laser irradiation.",

However, the deposition of salt crystals on the evaporator surface restrains the evaporation rate, which will affect further development of this technology. In this work, a spherical polystyrene foam was utilized as the material support, the surface of which was coated with photothermal materials for evaporator fabrication. The employing of well-prepared black Ti4O7 as a photothermal coating greatly improve the sunlight absorption of the surface, and the mixing of sodium alginate can achieve a hydrophilic effect. This unique coordination not only increases the evaporation rate of the spherical evaporator (2.46 kg m–2 h–1), but also performs well in water purification. The spherical design allows the evaporator to periodically clean the salt deposits on the evaporator surface through self-rotation, which provides a promising way to deal with the problem of salt deposition in evaporators in the future.",

However, a tunable method for the preparation of heteroatom-doped graphene with a special microstructure is still worth developing. Herein, a novel nitrogen-doped graphene with different microstructures is facilely synthesized via an in situ interlamination self-assembling method that employs the in situ formed Fe3(PO4)2 and organoamine as the catalyst and carbon source, respectively. By tuning the alkyl chain length in organoamine, octylamine and dodecylamine, bubble-like and sheet-like nitrogen-doped graphene are obtained, respectively. In three-electrode supercapacitor tests, besides the double-layer capacitance, the as-prepared graphene electrode material indeed exhibits pseudocapacitance due to the N-rich feature, delivering a good rate capability (166 F g–1 at 20 A g–1) and cyclic performance (96% capacitance retention over 20,000 cycles at 20 A g–1). More importantly, the symmetrical supercapacitor studies reveal the promising practicality due to the achieved excellent energy and power densities together with long-term cyclability. Thereby, this work establishes a new milestone for the facile synthesis of heteroatom-doped graphene with a desired microstructure for energy storage and other applications.",

However, blending donor and acceptor in the bulk volume results in a large extent of bimolecular charge recombination and increasing energetic disorder. Herein, we fabricated organic solar cells with polymer donor PM6 and nonfullerene acceptor N3 in bilayer structure to investigate the impact of planar heterojunction configurations on charge recombination and energetic landscapes. We find superior crystallinity features in the bilayer composed of pure donor and acceptor layers. The bimolecular charge recombination and energetic disorder are effectively suppressed compared with the bulk heterojunction counterparts. Thus, a power conversion efficiency as high as 18.1% (17.8% averaged) is achieved, which stands among the top values of planar heterojunction organic solar cells. In addition, improved device shelf stability is observed because of the fewer donor–acceptor interfaces in the active layer. Our results suggest that a planar heterojunction structure could efficiently suppress the bimolecular charge recombination and energetic disorder, providing an alternative pathway for developing solution-processed organic solar cells.",

Recently, the clusters have also been explored as promising scintillation materials due to the heavy copper halide cores that provide a large absorption cross section for X-ray radiation. However, the related research on copper halide cluster scintillators is only in its infancy, and the scintillation performance of the clusters still lags behind that of perovskite and its related metal halide structures. Here we report 0D cubane-like Cu4I4(L)4 (L = 4-benzylpyridine or 4-tert-butylpyridine) clusters with broad emission band, high photoluminescence quantum yield (>85%), and a large Stokes shift. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the emission of both clusters mainly originates from the ligand-to-core charge transfer state. Besides, we successfully synthesized the colloidal cluster microcrystals and fabricated microcrystal-based films for X-ray imaging applications. We found that the cluster-based X-ray screens exhibited high light yields (>30000 photons MeV–1), low detection limits (<150 nGy s–1), and excellent spatial resolutions exceeding 20 lp mm–1, surpassing the resolution of the most common commercial scintillators. We believe that this work provides the foundation for the further development of high-performance copper cluster-based scintillators.",

The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a great challenge on the treatment of bacterial infections. Quickly detecting pathogenic bacteria and effectively killing them are of great significance for the targeted treatment of bacterial infections.

On the other hand, functionalized Au NPs with versatile surface modifications can show good bactericidal effects. The surface chemistry of Au NPs can be tailored for dual functionality that integrates bacterial detection and antibacterial activity. The dual-functional Au NPs can greatly shorten the interval between detection and treatment, which is beneficial for the early inhibition of bacterial growth. In this Review, we focus on the strategies for bacterial detection and antibacterial applications based on the surface chemistry of Au NPs.

The self-assembly showed distinct isomeric effects: with changing positioning of the Cl, three-dimensional to one-dimensional self-assembled morphologies appeared in turn.

The abundant photoresponsive groups, highly ordered porous structure, and inherent hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus membrane structures endow COF membranes with excellent solar energy absorption, solar thermal conversion effect, water transportation, and evaporation efficiency. Without any supporting substrate or post-treatment, the steam generation rate of COF membranes reaches up to 3.02 kg/m2/h under 1 sun irradiation, and the energy conversion efficiency is up to 94%. This performance is the best among all solar thermal evaporators using COFs as solar thermal materials. The evaporation system not only works for clean and pure water generation but also for solar desalination. The good performance and reusability of COF membranes make them promising platforms for solar-thermal water production from seawater.",

Herein, a novel through-space conjugated molecule (2,3-PICz-XT) with dual delayed fluorescence and room-temperature phosphorescence is developed. Owing to suitable energy levels and strong spin–orbit coupling among excited states, 2,3-PICz-XT has short phosphorescence lifetimes at microsecond scale and high photoluminescence quantum yields in neat and doped films. 2,3-PICz-XT can function as efficient emitters in OLEDs, providing high external quantum efficiencies (ηexts) of up to 32.73% with small efficiency roll-offs. It can also efficiently sensitize various phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to yield excellent EL performances. Impressively, the hyperfluorescence OLEDs using 2,3-PICz-XT as sensitizer for multiple resonance TADF materials attain narrow EL spectra and greatly improved ηexts over 35%. To the best of our knowledge, 2,3-PICz-XT is the most efficient emitter and sensitizer ever reported for dual delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence materials.",

    "abstract": "Generally, laser-induced graphene (LIG) is produced by carbonizing a polymer film by a laser. Such large-area laser scanning of a film involves various processing parameters. LIGs with different characteristics can be created by altering each processing variable. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of the LIG surface structure generated according to the entire laser processing parameter range. However, few studies have focused on the surface morphological properties of LIGs. In this study, the characteristics of LIGs generated on a polyimide (PI) film with different laser processing parameters were studied based on the surface morphology, and the LIG was applied to a humidity and ions-selective sensor. When the PI film was attached to the diagonal ramp, the distance in the z-axis direction of the processing surface was changed, leading to a gradual change in the beam spot diameter at the focusing point. Through this method, continuous energy changes were induced, and LIGs with various surface colors and shapes that can be distinguished with the naked eyes were produced. The LIG produced by this process was classified into five types, and the specific surface area, water absorption rate, contact angle, surface resistance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the Raman spectrum were analyzed. Various distributions were observed according to the type of surface shape. These measured values affect sensor applications. We fabricated and tested humidity sensors and ion-selective electrodes and found that structures suitable for gas circulation with opened porous surfaces are sensitive to humidity change reactions, and structures with numerous active sites distributed due to the high specific surface area are suitable for ion exchange performance when coated with polymers. Sensor applications according to the surface morphology allow the existing LIG sensors to be further optimized in performance and production processes. Therefore, we propose a morphology-based method for LIG fabrication and sensor application.",

However, to implement such applications, the CALF-20 structure must endure extended exposure to environmental conditions that may lead to changes in structure, chemistry, and, hence, performance. Here we find that the originally reported CALF-20 phase (now denoted α-CALF-20) undergoes a structure transformation following exposure to humid environments to generate a new polymorph, β-CALF-20, identified here through combined synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. This α-to-β transformation is fully reversible with α-CALF-20 being regenerated by treating β-CALF-20 under dry air or vacuum. The rapid reversion of β- to α-CALF-20 under conditions relevant to measuring the gas adsorption isotherm required the CO2 adsorption properties for β-CALF-20 to be evaluated computationally. Experimental evaluation of the adsorption behavior of β-CALF-20 is not practical. These analyses suggest that β-CALF-20 has a higher CO2 heat of adsorption than α-CALF-20, which may be advantageous to CO2 sorption selectivity at low partial pressures.",

Here, we successfully developed a class of amine-functionalized quasi-MOF (X-UIO-EDA) with high CO2 capture capacity and found a water-assisted enhancement effect under 400 ppm of CO2 in the presence of humidity. In the quasi X-UIO-EDA series, 2-UIO-EDA displays a CO2 capture capacity of 0.44 mmol/g under humid air conditions, which is 10-fold that under dry air conditions, and exhibits lower CO2 desorption energy under humid air conditions. The comparative experiments also demonstrated that quasi-UIO-66 provided more amine modification sites, leading to higher CO2 capture capacity. The in situ FT-IR analysis demonstrated that water plays a crucial role in facilitating the transformation of −NHCOO– to –OCOOH species due to the steric hindrance and micropore confinement effects. Combining solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR and XPS measurements, we concluded that the observed enhancement of the CO2 capture capacity under humid air conditions is due to the formation of bicarbonate and hydronium carbamate species, along with the formation of weak hydrogen bonds between these species.",

Constructing an artificial neural network (ANN) is a common means to realize neuromorphic computing, which has exhibited potential applications in pattern recognition, complex sensing, and other areas.

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe renal dysfunction syndrome associated with high morbidity and mortality. Excessive production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) is involved in the development and progression of AKI. Therefore, scavenging endogenous RONS and reducing excessive oxidative stress is essential for restoring renal function after AKI. Although nanozyme-mediated antioxidant therapy has been proposed as an effective strategy to prevent AKI, low renal uptake and high organ toxicity hinder its potential for practical applications. To address this problem, we have designed a metal-phenolic nanozyme named RosA-Mn NPs, which possesses cascade antioxidant functionalities. The nanozyme has multienzymatic cascade capacity as well as broad spectrum of ROS and free radical scavenging activities. As expected, RosA-Mn NPs promote the recovery of mitochondrial function and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and secondary inflammation through effective ROS scavenging in vitro. Moreover, RosA-Mn NPs overcome the shortcomings of artificial enzymes that failed to rapidly accumulate in kidney tissues. The renal tubular targeting of RosA-Mn NPs could be exploited to mitigate the tubular damage, improve tubular functions, and eventually prevent the progression of AKI. Notably, RosA-Mn NPs also protect kidney from oxidation and inflammation in a cisplatin-induced AKI mouse model. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that autophagy, apoptosis, and antioxidation-related pathways were modulated by the treatment with RosA-Mn NPs. In summary, the multienzymatic activities and biocompatibility of RosA-Mn NPs show great potential in the treatment of AKI and other ROS-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infections are common complications for diabetic wounds and represent a considerable challenge for wound therapy. Diabetic wound infections differ from those of normal wounds. Owing to the special microenvironment around them, diabetic wounds are more susceptible to infection and are difficult to heal. Nanozymes are of great significance to treat diabetic wound bacterial infections through unique catalytic activities, particularly for controlling drug-resistant bacteria. However, their intrinsically low catalytic activity largely restricts their bactericidal function. Therefore, it is crucial to design and develop novel antibacterial modalities with multiple mechanisms of action. In this study, we design and synthesize a CeO2/Nb2C nanocomposite with dual functions of peroxidase activity and an excellent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal property. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, the CeO2/Nb2C nanocomposite produced a photothermal antibacterial effect and simultaneously displayed a synergistic enzyme catalytic property, thereby killing bacteria in a sustained manner with more than 80% sterilization ratio. The CeO2/Nb2C nanocomposite could accelerate the recovery of diabetic wounds when the skin lesions infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were irradiated with an 808 nm laser in a diabetic mouse model. An RNA sequencing assay was used to profile the dynamic transcriptome of MRSA. The data set reveals that bacteria experience dysfunction in energy metabolism, cell morphology, and oxidative stress systems during the treatment with CeO2/Nb2C nanocomposite under NIR irradiation, which further affects their survival. Moreover, the CeO2/Nb2C nanocomposite exhibits good biosafety in vitro and in vivo, which indicates their potency as antibacterial agents. This study provides a novel antibacterial strategy by the combination of the catalytic sterilization with the NIR photothermal activity of nanozymes for the effective treatment of MRSA-related diabetic wound infection.",

Here, a novel SEG is prepared by in situ ring-opening polymerization of thioctic acid (TA) in a polymerizable hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES). Further depolymerization of poly(TA) is achieved by synergistic interaction between the eutectic monomer and hydrophobic DES components, resulting in the SEG exhibiting highly optical transparency, extreme stretchability, and full recyclability. Moreover, the hydrophobic interaction and multiple dynamic interactions enable the self-healing and self-adhesive processes of SEG to be easily realized even underwater. Given these comprehensive capabilities, SEGs are used as external encapsulation layers for liquid metals to prepare stretchable composite wires for underwater electromyographic signal monitoring. The methodology provides a new route for recyclable integrated electronic components and green underwater adhesives.",

Here we report the facile synthesis of four kinds of nearly monodispersed CuTrz (HTrz = 1H,1,2,4-triazole) metal–organic framework (MOF) nanostructures with different sizes by controlling the reaction kinetics. Significantly, small CuTrz nanostructures demonstrate much superior CO2RR performance over the large counterparts toward multicarbon production in neutral electrolytes, with optimized Faradaic efficiency of 55.4% and 81.8% for ethylene and multicarbon products, respectively. Detailed structural characterizations reveal that small CuTrz nanostructures are polycrystalline and rich in grain boundaries, while the large ones are single crystalline. This work highlights the importance of simultaneous defect and size control of MOFs in boosting their CO2RR performance for multicarbon production.",

However, the problems of low transmittance and large light scattering due to the difficulty of powder phase processing have severely limited their practical applications in third-order nonlinear optics (NLO). Herein, we report the first successful synthesis of a series of donor–acceptor (D–A) COFs films (thickness of ∼100 nm) with uniform transparency and narrow optical band gap by the solvothermal and solid–liquid interface methods for third-order NLO applications. Most importantly, the designed PT–PA film exhibits excellent NLO performance, including a normalized transmission value of ∼2.55 at the beam focus, a modulation depth (As) of 139%, and a high nonlinear absorption coefficient (β) of 1.83 × 106 cm GW–1 at the pulse energy of 1 μJ, which is superior to most recently reported third-order NLO materials. The excellent third-order NLO properties are mainly attributed to the homogeneous transparency of the COFs films and the extended-ordered conjugated structure and narrow optical band gap of the COFs films, which enhance the charge transfer in their structures and thus yield excellent third-order NLO behavior. This work provides an option for the development of high-performance NLO optical devices and opens a new path for the future development of COFs films in the optical fields.",

More S atoms in dithiine-linked CoPc-DSDS-COF contributed to the higher conductivity (0.78 mS cm–1) and higher reductive ability than those of thiomorpholine-linked CoPc-DNDS-COF (0.62 mS cm–1) and, thus, result in higher activity with a partial current density for CO of 30.42 mA cm–2 at −1.0 V vs RHE and in selectivity toward CO2 reduction with the Faradaic efficiency of 96.5% at −0.9 V. Additionally, the theoretical calculation revealed the dithiine linkages showed better suppressing ability of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction than the thiomorpholine linkages.

Herein, a highly porous and chemically stable metal–organic framework (MOF) with enriched sulfonate groups in its pores is synthesized by performing the postsynthetic immobilization of the sulfonate-based ligand within a zirconium-based MOF, MOF-808, and the resulting sulfonate-grafted MOF (SO3-MOF-808) is proposed as a \"porous Nafion\"─an appealing alternative to the conventional Nafion coating for modulating the selectivity of electrochemical reactions. As a demonstration, the electrochemical sensing of dopamine (DA), which usually suffers from interference caused by the oxidation of the coexisting negatively charged ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA), is implemented. With the use of the SO3-MOF-808 thin film deposited on the active electrode surface, both the current signal for DA oxidation and the selectivity toward the oxidation of DA against those of AA and UA remarkably outperform those achieved by the Nafion thin film with an optimized film thickness. Findings here suggest the new role of such sulfonate-grafted MOFs as an advanced alternative to Nafion in a range of electrochemical sensing systems and other complicated electrochemical reactions.",

Here, by taking Mg-MOF-74 as a model system, we propose the photoexcited catalyst can generally activate CO2 via single-electron-transfer mechanism, leading to the rapid formation of •CO2– radical. Subsequently, beneficial for the activation of inert CO2, the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) of the whole cycloaddition, i.e., the CO2 attacking step, significantly decreases, resulting in the feasible synthesis of cyclic carbonates under ambient condition. With the combination of synchrotron radiation in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and the density functional theory calculation, the reaction process and corresponding key intermediates are systematically investigated, revealing the CO2 activation to be the most energy consumption steps in cyclic carbonate production, rather than the ring-opening of epoxide, thus furnishing new insights into photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition.",

Specifically, the synthesized NaCrO2 cathode showcases a high specific capacity of 94.7 mAh g–1 at a high rate of 20C under room temperature and displays good capacity retention of 97.2% after 100 cycles at 1C under −20 °C. Additionally, the full-cell device demonstrates a remarkable initial capacity of 113.0 mAh g–1 at a rate of 0.1C and exhibits excellent cyclic performance, retaining 84.2% of its capacity after 100 cycles at 0.2C under −10 °C. This study opens up new possibilities to design LTMOs with improved ion diffusion kinetics for alkali metal-ion batteries.",

However, the exciton effect arising from the Coulomb interaction among electrons–holes cannot be disregarded. Exploring new approaches to regulate exciton dissociation on COFs to facilitate photocatalysis is significant. Within this work, localized defects were fabricated on the skeleton of the COFs by the one-step synthesis method of introducing monoaldehyde electron donors (pyrene, ferrocene, and triphenylamine). The formation of D–A configuration defects can directionally change the local electronic structure and charge distribution of COFs and induce enhanced dipole polarization, thus, promoting exciton dissociation and enhancing photocatalytic activity. Among them, the pyrene electron donor-constructed defective COF exhibited a 7.8-fold increase in the aqueous-phase oxygen-containing photopolymerization rate relative to the pristine COF, with a conversion rate of 80% within 30 min.",

    "abstract": "With the increase in dependence on renewable energy sources, interest in energy storage systems has increased, particularly with solar cells, redox flow batteries, and lithium batteries. Multiple diagnostic techniques have been utilized to characterize various factors in relation to the battery performance. Electrochemical tests were used to study the energy density, capacity, cycle life, rate, and other related properties. Furthermore, it is critical to correlate the information collected from the characterization of materials to its properties while functioning for advanced batteries. In situ and operando electron microscopy methods are specifically designed to conduct such characterization, and analysis was found to be the best method to achieve that objective. However, the characterization information collected varies according to the types of electron microscopy techniques. Also, the use of complementary analytical techniques further provides a more comprehensive study of these different characterizations, giving insights into the morphology-performance relationship of battery materials and interfaces. Within this review, the focus is on in situ and operando electron microscopy characterization of battery materials, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM), and three-dimensional (3D) electron tomography. This review aims to cover both advanced electron microscopy imaging techniques and their applications in the characterization of battery materials involving cathode, anode, and separator and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The review discusses a range of advanced electron microscopy techniques, including TEM, SEM, and atomic force microscopy, as well as associated analytical techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The use of these techniques has led to significant advances in our understanding of battery materials, including the identification of new phases and structures, the study of interface properties, and the characterization of defects and degradation mechanisms. Future perspectives on these advanced electron microscopy techniques and opportunities are also discussed. Overall, this review highlights the importance of electron microscopy in battery research and the potential for these techniques to drive future advancements in the field.",

    "abstract": "Type I photosensitizers provide great potential for effective antihypoxia cancer treatment because of their low O2 reliance. To achieve tumor specificity, activatable type I photosensitizers that can selectively respond to tumor-related stimuli and thereafter activate their phototoxicity are urgently required, which however are rare. We herein report a hemicyanine-based scaffold with effective type I photoreactions for activatable antihypoxic PDT against tumors. The common hemicyanine (Cy) endows minimized ROS generation, which can be nicely tuned to boost type I ROS production by introducing the halogens to increase the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) constant and thus favor the intersystem crossing (ISC) rate. The optimized CyBr is further modified to achieve an activatable probe (CyBrP) that can specifically unlock its fluoro-photoacoustic signals and phototoxicity upon interaction with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) overexpressed in tumors. By virtue of the high sensitivity and selectivity toward ALP as well as the low O2-dependence of type I ROS generation, CyBrP allows for precise phototheranostics of tumors, leading to effectively suppressed tumor growth in living mice. Therefore, this study presents a facile halogen-substituted strategy to construct hemicyanine-based type I photosensitizers that can serve as universal scaffolds for activatable antihypoxia PDT.",

Herein, a highly efficient and robust MOF-based 3D ion conducting network was rationally designed by in situ grown MOF nanocrystals on the 3D polyimide fiber network, where (1) the optimized MOF with appropriate pore sizes and abundant open metal sites can effectively restrict the movement of the anion to homogenize the Li+ flux, (2) the in situ growth of densely packed MOFs builds continuous ion channels to promote the rapid transport of Li+, and (3) the mechanically and chemically robust polyimide network bestows the CSE with superior mechanical strength and high oxidation stability. Consequently, the resulting CSE demonstrates high ionic conductivity, a high Li+ transference number, excellent Li compatibility, a wide potential window, and excellent mechanical robustness, which enables the stable cycling of high-voltage all-solid-state Li-metal batteries at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "There are two standard methods for gas detection that have been developed in recent years. Utilizing metal oxide semiconductors for the chemisorption of gas and monitoring the conductivity change are among the most widely used approaches for gas sensing. Another alternative method is an electrochemical sensing platform. Considering the pros and cons of these two types of gas sensors, it seems that the better approach is to find a way to benefit from both the advantages of the materials and electrochemical technique. Due to their unique properties, two-dimensional (2D) borophene sheets are promising materials for utilizing in the fabrication of the next generation of electronic devices. Utilizing borophene sheets in the fabrication of gas sensors opens a new world of gas sensor design and technology. This work reports fabrication of a borophene-based electrochemoresistance (ECR) sensor benefiting both chemoresistance performance and the advantages of electrochemical sensors. A sensor with a new design is introduced here based on the high electrochemical activity of borophene and its unique electrical properties. Not only the electrical conductivity of borophene but also the electrochemical activity of borophene changes when exposed to gas agents. The use of this exceptional capability of borophene opens up a pathway to develop a new type of gas sensor. The sensitivity of the ECR sensor was compared in this work, and the results show 10 and 4 times more sensitivity for the ECR sensor than the conventional electrochemical and chemoresistance sensors, respectively.",

Previous studies have employed perovskites as reductive sides in a Z-scheme heterojunction to suppress charge recombination, which however still encounter low activity and selectivity because of the absence of specific catalytic sites for CO2 reduction. In this work, we report a strategy that enables a CsPbBr3 perovskite for photocatalytic CO2 methanation. The central concept is the construction of a Z-scheme heterojunction using zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) as the reductive side. The enhanced charge separation in the CsPbBr3/ZnPc heterojunction provides the catalytically active sites in ZnPc with sufficient energetic electrons for CO2 methanation. As a result, CsPbBr3/ZnPc achieves selectivity up to 89% and activity of 168 μmol g–1 h–1 for CH4 production, well exceeding all of the reported perovskite-based photocatalysts.

    "abstract": "Polypropylene is one of the most challenging plastics to recycle or upcycle due to its excellent chemical and thermal stability. Here, we report an effective two-step synthesis to prepare carbon dots (CDs) from polypropylene (PP). In the first step, bulk PP is converted to PP nanoparticles (PP-NPs) by using a reprecipitation process. In the second step, the PP-NPs are carbonized by a hydrothermal treatment. The size, structure, and photonic properties of the PP-CDs vary significantly with hydrothermal treatment temperature. At higher temperature, the PP-CDs product is ∼2.5 nm in diameter with a quantum yield of 10.3% and is free from unconverted PP. At lower temperature (120 °C), the PP-CDs are large in size (∼70 nm) and exhibit low quantum yield (0.2%). This work demonstrates an effective method to fully convert polypropylene to carbon dots and shows a high degree of tunability in the size, structure, and photonic properties of the product.",

    "abstract": "Separation of methanol-to-olefins (MTO) products to obtain high-purity C2H4 and C3H6 is of great importance, since it provides an alternative process for such important industrial raw materials. However, developing adsorbents with high C2H4/C3H6 selectivity and productivity remains challenging. Herein, we report an ultrastable layered hydrogen-bonded framework (HOF-NBDA), which features C3H6 preferred pore with multiple interlaminar interactions with C3H6. It delivers an ultrahigh C3H6 uptake (3.6 mmol g–1) at 10 kPa, while absorbs only 0.3 mmol g–1 C2H4 and shows a high C2H4/C3H6 selectivity (11.1). Experimental breakthroughs show that HOF-NBDA can efficiently separate C3H6/C2H4 (50/50, v/v) at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as relative humidities and provides a high C2H4 productivity (5.7 mol kg–1, purity ≥99.95%). Meanwhile, 4.5 mol kg–1 C3H6 (purity ≥99.5%) can also be collected during the desorption process. Additionally, thanks to ultrahigh stability, good scalability, and easy regeneration, HOF-NBDA is considered as a promising material for one-step energy-efficient separation of MTO products.",

However, the C–B state often suffers from inevitable degradation, while its recovery encounters significant challenges. Therefore, holistic antiwetting/dewetting designs deserve more attention to deal with multiscale water exposure of ADISS involving multifactorial interactions in time and space. Herein, three criteria were proposed for the design of nonwetting ADISS: high intrinsic contact angle, fine nanoscale structures, and appropriate spatial distribution of micro/nanostructures. By optimized air spraying, the target nanoengineered surfaces were constructed with a stable nano-Cassie state and improved anti-icing and antifrosting properties. Moreover, the dewetting ability to achieve the recovery of the C–B state was demonstrated, based on which a novel deicing mechanism involving coalescence-induced ice detachment has been revealed. This design method of ADISS is holistic and easy to execute, thus, having practical value in engineering applications.",

The rapid UV-cured copolymerization of pyrene-1-carboxylate derivative (PyC) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) prepolymer ensured that the resulting PU systems possessed dual persistent luminescence of phosphorescence at 626 nm of a lifetime over 200 ms and delayed fluorescence (DF) at 393 nm of a lifetime up to 26 ms. Such a big separation of afterglow peaks (over 230 nm) is from the aggregated and the dispersed states of PyC and resulted in an afterglow color change from purple, via orange and yellow, to green.

Recent strides in hydrogen production through water splitting have marked significant progress, leveraging its inherent benefits, such as zero carbon emissions, safety, and exceptional product purity. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in surmounting the substantial energy barrier and water-splitting costs. Many efficient electrocatalysts have been innovatively designed and reported to address these hurdles. However, the translation of these advances into industrial-scale applications faces multifaceted obstacles. Urgent demands for high-performance electrocatalysts meeting industrial standards underscore the imperative for a deeper comprehension of water-splitting systems. This review delves into the latest developments in water electrolysis, synthesizing experimental findings and promising strategies with different electrochemical parameters along with high entropy metals, doping engineering, interface construction, and defect engineering. Despite considerable strides in creating efficient water-splitting electrocatalysts and numerous recent investigations, numerous challenges persist, impeding the widespread industrial implementation of electrolytic water splitting.

Furthermore, theoretical calculation results indicated that the uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen sites of ligands in CUST-861 have a lower pKa value than the uncoordinated imidazole nitrogen sites of ligands in CUST-860, which is more conductive to proton transfer.

Here we report benzophenone derivatives that maintain high intersystem crossing efficiency and disrupt the n-π* transition's contribution to their T1 states, giving the emergence of a 2.0 s long phosphorescence lifetime under ambient conditions. Aromatic electron-donating substituents with low T1 energy levels are selected to build benzophenone derivatives. Consequently, the benzophenone derivatives' T1 states exhibit major localized excitation character from aromatic substituents and minor n-π* transition character. The modulation of electronic conjugation and dihedral angles between the benzophenone group and the aromatic substituent have been found to further disrupt the n-π* transition of the benzophenone derivatives' T1 states. After doping into rigid matrices, the resultant room-temperature phosphorescence materials display bright afterglow, exhibit excellent processability into diverse shapes, function as donors to form long-wavelength afterglow materials via energy transfer, and show aqueous dispersity enabled by emulsion polymerization and potential bioapplication.",

    "abstract": "The development of transparent wearable devices capable of self-healing and efficient fog removal is of great significance. In this study, we have realized the fabrication of a wearable composite film exhibiting remarkable transparency along with efficient light-triggered healing and defogging capabilities. This was achieved by integrating plasmonic silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) embedded covalent–organic framework (COF) nanosheets, denoted as AgNPs/CONs, into a waterborne elastic polyurethane (PU) matrix. Due to the synergistic effect between AgNPs with high plasmonic properties and COF nanosheets with excellent photothermal characteristics, the resulting composite film, even with an ultralow loading of plasmonic AgNPs/CONs (0.15 wt %), demonstrate a rapid temperature increase to 80 °C upon exposure to 500 mW cm–2 near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation for 12 s. Simultaneously, it maintains a high optical transmittance of 96.2% at a thin film thickness of 20 μm with an extremely low loading of plasmonic AgNPs/CONs (0.08 wt %). This localized temperature elevation effectively eliminates surface fog and promotes the healing of mechanical damage within the composite film, achieving a healing efficiency exceeding 98%. Our findings represent a significant advancement in the design of transparent and photothermally active materials based on COFs, opening up new prospects for next-generation electronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with excellent structural tunability have emerged as fascinating photocatalysts to fulfill future energy demands. Here, we developed a COFs heterostructure by assembling two COFs for photocatalytic overall water splitting. The resulting heterostructure exhibited an effective spatial separation of photoredox sites originating from the efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers through an orientated interfacial electron transfer pathway. Accordingly, the heterostructure of the COFs displays excellent activity for stoichiometric water splitting into H2 and O2 under 5 W white LED light irradiation. Our efficiencies of H2 and O2 evolution rates up to 120 and 58 μmol g–1 h–1 are significantly higher than those reported previously. The combination of experiments and theoretical calculations shows that water oxidation proceeds by a metal-free hydration-mediated pathway. This work sheds light on a rational design of the COF heterostructure with spatially separated photoredox for water splitting.",

The rational use of the stoichiometry of mixed ligands in chiral metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) to induce chiral inversion of the enantiomeric space groups is a crucial topic in structural chemistry. However, no remarkable results have been reported yet. In this work, we synthesized chiral MOFs through the assembly of chiral camphoric acid (d/l-cam) and achiral tetradentate ligands. Interestingly, the visible single-crystal structures confirmed that chirality inversion of the enantiomeric space groups can be achieved via stoichiometric modulation of mixed ligands. Significantly, the switches of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) along with the inversion of enantiomeric space groups can be observed clearly. Moreover, the encapsulated guest emitters exhibit the inverted CPL, revealing the helical-channel-dependent chirality transfer. The obtained results constitute a milestone in the field of chiral crystal engineering of MOFs.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the global population and industry has increased global warming and energy consumption. Clean, sustainable, and renewable sources of energy must be employed if this critical problem is to be resolved. Hydrogen (H2) has become one of the most promising fuel sources within the range of alternatives. A noteworthy method of creating hydrogen is by electrochemically splitting water into H2 and O2. As a result, the need for inexpensive, accessible catalysts with remarkable catalytic performance for producing environmentally friendly H2 has become crucial. The newly emerging class of 2-D layered MXenes, which consists of nitrides, transition metal carbides (TMC), and carbonitrides, is an impressive competitor in this race. MXenes offer excellent electrochemical properties, hydrophilicity, and reactivity, making them suitable for water-splitting applications. However, systematic reviews on strategies and mechanical chemistry of electrocatalytic water redox reactions for H2 productions are rare. This comprehensive review analysis addresses many strategies for boosting MXene catalytic efficiency during oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). These approaches include heteroatom doping, alloying, quantum dot doping, and plasma surface modification. Furthermore, this study highlights the many efforts and prospective paths for increasing the economic viability of MXenes as electrocatalysts for green H2 generation. As a result, this review opens new avenues for high-performance MXenes in green energy applications, promising a more sustainable energy future.",

However, their fabrication remains a grand challenge because conventional methods are generally operated under near-equilibrium conditions. To break the thermodynamic limits for discovering novel materials, numerous fabrication methods by adopting extreme strategies have been developed, including ultrafast synthesis, Joule heating, carbon thermal shock, pulse heating, extreme temperature gradients, and rapid solidification. A common feature of these methods is that the target material is processed under a far-from-equilibrium (FFE) thermodynamic state, where a new kinetic route is created for the evolution of an unprecedented composition/structure. In this review, we provide a unifying view and guiding strategies for engineering FFE environments during materials synthesis, categorized within both temporal and spatial dimensions of the thermodynamic landscape. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of FFE materials, not only as platforms for deeper understanding nonequilibrium behaviors, but also as a framework for designing innovative materials for advanced technologies.",

In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the energetically inferior SEI formation mechanism, compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), results in the formation of a thin, thermally vulnerable, and less passivating SEI on the hard carbon electrode. Notably, electrolyte for SIBs have a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Na-solvated ethylene carbonate and a upstream-shifted swing voltage range, compared with LIBs, which reduces the deposition of SEI on the hard carbon electrode from insufficient overpotential development. Additionally, the larger ionic radius of Na compared to that of Li-ion leads to a lower binding energy of Na ions to the anion in the SEI component, increasing the solubility of the SEI in the electrolytes. Consequently, the inferior thermal stability of the SEI in SIBs results in more-pronounced self-discharge of the hard carbon electrode during high-temperature storage, compared to LIBs.",

However, it is still a great challenge to design target phosphors with both short ESL and high luminescence efficiency. Herein, we propose an efficient machine learning approach based on a small dataset to establish the ESL prediction model, thereby facilitating the discovery of new Mn4+-activated fluorides with short ESLs. Such a model can not only accurately predict the ESLs of Mn4+ in fluorides but also quantify the impact of structure features on ESLs, therefore elucidating the \"structure-lifetime\" correlations. Guided by the correlations, two new Mn4+-doped tetramethylammonium (TMA)-based hybrid fluorides (TMA)2BF6:Mn4+ (B = Sn or Hf) with both short ESLs (τ ≤ 3.7 ms) and high quantum efficiencies (internal QEs > 92%, external QEs > 55%) have been discovered successfully. A prototype displayer with excellent performance (∼124% National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) color gamut) is assembled by employing a (TMA)2SnF6:Mn4+-based white Mini-LED backlight module, demonstrating its practical prospects in high-quality displays.

    "abstract": "The electrical control of coercivity and efficient magnetization switching in 2D ferromagnetic crystals at room temperature are crucial for next-generation 2D spintronics. However, known ferromagnetic systems exhibit limited adjustability of coercivity at room temperature, and electrically induced magnetization switching typically involves a high critical current density and substantial power dissipation. Here, we report the highly tunable coercivity and efficient multistate magnetization switching at room temperature using a single 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The coercivity can be adjusted to around 98.06% through the current application. Additionally, the critical current density and power dissipation for magnetization switching are impressively low, measuring around 7.31 × 105 A·cm–2 and 6.03 × 1013 W·m–3, respectively. This ultralow power dissipation is 1–5 orders of magnitude lower than that observed in other 2D ferromagnetic systems. Furthermore, multistate magnetization switching is also realized at room temperature. The findings of this study pave the way for electrical control of ferromagnetism at room temperature and the practical implementation of vdW-integrated 2D spintronics.",

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic H2 production from water has garnered widespread attention in recent years. However, the utilization of hole sacrificial agents poses challenges, such as resource wastage, increased costs, and heightened CO2 emissions. In this study, we integrate photocatalytic H2 production with the conversion of water-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) plastics, demonstrating a 10-fold enhancement in the H2 production rate compared to pure water conditions. Under irradiation, PVA dissolved in water undergoes molecular chain scission and partial photooxidation without significant CO2 emissions, showing higher H2 production efficiency and lower environmental impact compared with water-insoluble plastics that require depolymerization pretreatments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of using wastewater generated from the disposal of commercial PVA products (washing gel film, plastic bags, etc.) in enhancing H2 production. The findings of this study contribute to advancing our understanding of efficient hydrogen production and sustainable management of PVA waste in conjunction with renewable energy technologies.",

Essential synaptic behaviors have been successfully simulated, such as learning experience behavior simulation, international Morse code communication, and high-pass filtering. The synaptic device shows stable synaptic properties when bent at different radii of curvature and at different numbers of bending cycles. When the device is extremely deformed under a radius of curvature of 4 mm, the postsynaptic current is still maintained above 84%. Moreover, an artificial reflex arc was constructed using the flexible optoelectronic synapse as a key information processing unit. Recognition of digits was achieved by constructing an artificial neural network under DUV light stimulation, achieving the highest recognition rate so far, up to 94%.

Herein, we present an effective strategy to elaborate a fully aromatic polyurea membrane (FAPM) that enables superior solvent-/thermal-resistant separation performances through a temperature-modulated interfacial polymerization at an alkane-ionic liquid interface. The key of our design lies in harnessing the exceptional solvency of ionic liquid to develop aromatic polyamines instead of conventional aliphatic ones, combining a temperature-modulated synthesis to overcome the inherently sluggish kinetics of toluene diisocyanate and aromatic polyamines for boosting their reaction rate by 466 times. With this design, the defect-free and robust FAPM can be facilely synthesized in a short time and deliver a high and stable separation performance even in dimethylformamide at 80 °C.

To address this, a new class of mechanochemically stabilized, low-crystalline sodium metal oxyhalides NaMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta) is developed. By using the combination of scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, pair distribution function analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we qualitatively explored the composition and local structure of these oxyhalides. Notably, NaNbOCl4 and NaTaOCl4 exhibit high ionic conductivities of 1.2 and 1.5 mS cm–1, respectively. Although the instability of NaMOCl4 against Na excludes their use as stand-alone separators in solid-state sodium metal batteries, the successful operation of a solid-state battery employing NaTaOCl4 as a catholyte at room temperature demonstrates that NaMOCl4 is a promising catholyte material.",

While there are current treatment options like medication and surgery, an increasing number of patients experience difficult-to-treat rhinosinusitis (DTRS). To address this challenge, a highly efficient intelligent nanoplatform (ALCe6 NPs) has been developed, which is formed by loading chlorin e6 (Ce6) onto nanoliposomes composed of cholesterol modified with l-arginine and soybean phospholipids. Under near-infrared (NIR) light stimulation, Ce6 is efficiently activated to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO). This synergistic effect of ROS generated from photodynamic therapy (PDT) and NO release enables the dispersion of bacterial biofilms and the effective eradication of drug-resistant bacteria. Genome analysis of the combined antibacterial action of ALCe6 NPs reveals changes in genes related to cellular metabolism, transcription processes, and bacterial resistance. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ALCe6 NPs in treating DTRS caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, a rat model is constructed to monitor the treatment process and assess the outcomes. With its significant advantages, ALCe6 NPs show promising potential as a biomedical tool to combat drug-resistant bacterial infections in vivo, offering hope for managing DTRS and improving patient outcomes.",

Conventional macroscopic thermometers are not suited for cellular-scale measurements, necessitating the development of microscopic molecular thermometers. Fluorescent molecular thermometers have received widespread attention due to their noninvasive nature and versatility in reporting various parameters. In particular, molecular thermometers with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties have gained prominence owing to their superior stability, excellent signal-to-noise ratio, high contrast, and adaptability. The luminescence of AIE fluorophores often relies on a restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM) mechanism; therefore, the fundamental premise underlying the design of AIE thermometers is the modulation of molecular motion through temperature variations. In this Review, we summarize recently reported AIE thermometers, focusing on their molecular design, temperature response mechanisms, and applications in cell imaging. Furthermore, an exploration of the structure–activity relationships governing these thermometers is undertaken with the aim of offering valuable design strategies for diverse AIE temperature sensors.",

This study investigates the influence of free energy on hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) and active site density on HER pathways, incorporating the consideration of the rate-determining step (RDS). Contrary to previous assumptions, it is found that ΔGH* plays a pivotal role, with VT pathways favored when ΔGH* approaches zero, and while VH pathways occurs in other cases, irrespective of active site density.

    "abstract": "Selective separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4) remains a significant challenge in the field of gas separation. Non-thermally driven separation technology based on metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offers an efficient and environmentally friendly approach. Herein, a Ni-based anionic MOF (iMOF-1A) was employed for gas separation for the first time. The differential recognition of various gas molecules is enhanced by suitable pore sizes, accessible aromatic rings, and cations outside the framework. Experimental results demonstrate that iMOF-1A exhibits exceptional uptake ratios for C2H2/CO2 (2.27) and C2H2/C2H4 (1.48), which surpass those of most previously reported MOF materials. Furthermore, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity calculations display a promising theoretical separation performance, which is supported by molecular simulations. Breakthrough experiments further validate that iMOF-1A not only effectively separates C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures but also exhibits excellent separation performance and humidity stability for C2H2/C2H4/CO2 ternary mixtures.",

In this study, we show a flexible two-dimensional metal–organic framework (MOF) acting as an efficient adsorbent for the adsorptive separation of C6 cyclic hydrocarbons via molecular-sieving. The 2D-MOF features fully reversible structure transformation upon the removal/recoordination of terminal H2O and solvent DMF, and between activated and hydrocarbon-loaded forms. The distinct temperature- and adsorbate-dependent adsorption behavior is accompanied by guest-induced expansion of the layered structure. Such behavior enables the full discrimination of the individual C6 cyclic hydrocarbons from their binary and ternary mixtures by temperature-programmed protocols, achieving the third and second highest uptake ratios for C6H6/C6H12 and C6H10/C6H12 among MOFs reported to date.

In response, we customized a GelMA-based hydrogel repair system involved in the whole healing process to promote tissue regeneration in a fine-tuned immune milieu.

Batteries Electrodes Materials Metals Solid electrolytes Special IssuePublished as part of ACS Materials Letters special issue \"Post-Lithium Battery Materials\".The advent of novel technologies has always demanded greater energy, and it is evident that conventional Li-ion batteries are reaching their limits in safety and energy density. The fields of electric mobility and storage systems are calling for a new generation of electrochemical energy storage systems to outperform current Li-ion batteries. However, replacing a robust and commercialized technology that is now 30 years old is not a simple task, and multiple candidates can be foreseen. (1) Over the past few years, post-lithium-ion battery technologies have begun to emerge within the landscape of electrochemical energy storage systems. These technologies are based on various M-ions (M = Na, Ca, Al, K, Mg, etc.) or involve replacing a liquid electrolyte with a solid one. (2) They rely on the development of suitable electroactive materials and superionic conductors to deliver high energy and power densities while improving battery safety. This Special Issue places emphasis on future battery technologies that rely on elements less critical than Li.The simplest way toward post-Li-ion batteries is to replace the Li ions with another charge carrier, such as Na or K ions, while keeping the liquid electrolyte. As we know from the literature, graphite, the most commonly used electrode material for Li-ion batteries, cannot be used in Na-ion systems and must be replaced by hard carbon materials, which unfortunately have a lower specific charge than graphite. Bartolomei and Giorgi (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01119), through electronic structure calculations, proposed a suitable negative electrode for Na-ion batteries, γ-graphyne multilayers that could reach a specific charge of 372 mAh·g–1. Such materials could be a game changer for post-lithium-ion technology, further increasing the energy density of batteries while limiting long-term aging, as this material can also accommodate the volume changes caused by the intercalation of ions. In addition to studies on negative electrode materials, further work is needed to identify the most promising positive electrode materials. Clavelin et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01833) have thoroughly investigated a Prussian white positive electrode for Na-ion batteries. In fact, they demonstrated that the hydration level of the materials is of paramount importance to achieve a high specific charge, and that electrode materials should be handled with care to obtain the best electrochemical performance.While sodium (Na) has been the most studied element to replace Li, other alternatives can be found in the literature, notably potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and aluminum (Al). To date, mastering the chemical reactivity of metal electrodes is a challenge that has not yet been solved for Li metal electrodes. Löw et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01589) decided to investigate the solid electrolyte interphase that develops on Mg and Al metals while the electrode is in contact with either Grignard electrolytes or ionic liquids. Their results highlight the need to properly investigate the interfacial properties of metal electrodes and, in particular, to properly determine the transference number of the electrolyte, a critical factor in electrolyte investigation. As metal negative electrodes are extremely difficult to control, a novel approach described in the literature is based on an anodeless approach, (3) where the M-ions from the positive electrode materials are deposited on an M-philic layer used as a current collector on the negative electrode side. Vanoppen et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01561) used this approach to deposit Zn for anodeless Zn batteries. They showed that by using InCl3 as an electrolyte additive they could form a zincophilic interphase, which improved the Coulombic efficiency of the system. Another approach to metal negative electrodes is to switch to alloys, which are generally more stable than their metal counterparts. Jagger et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01219) focused their work on the development of potassium alloys as a suitable negative electrode material for Li-ion batteries. Indeed, K metal, like many other metals, is used as a reference electrode despite several weaknesses such as its high chemical reactivity and unstable potential. They developed two different alloys, K-Bi and K-In, and showed that Bi-Bi2K is an interesting alternative, as it allows an accurate electrochemical study of K-ion batteries. Vijaya Kumar Saroja et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01455) chose to investigate a well-known MoS2 material as a suitable negative electrode material for Li-ion batteries. Using a series of advanced characterization techniques, they demonstrate a very complex reaction mechanism with anionic and cationic redox centers responsible for the good electrochemical performance of the materials. Based on their findings, the reaction mechanism can be tuned by controlling the depth of discharge of the cell, thus enabling long-term cyclability.If all the previously discussed papers are based on the M-ion carrier for post-Li-ion batteries, some research is dedicated to mastering halogen chemistry, such as anion-shuttling fluoride ion batteries. Zou et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01296) review the challenge of such systems, where the development of novel electrolytes is key to advancing this new research direction, as fluoride-based batteries could theoretically reach 6 V electrochemical stability windows compared to 4 V for conventional Li-ion batteries, a game changer in energy density. Despite being based on lithium, Li-sulfur batteries are still considered as a post-Li-ion technology due to their particular reaction mechanism that relies on sulfur, an electronically insulating material, which is converted to lithium polysulfides during the course of cycling. Bird et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01646) have carried out a meta-analysis and provide a tool that can screen the literature data and correlate the electrochemical performance with the way the sulfur electrode was made (carbon content, ratio of the elements, etc.). This database (which can be downloaded here) can then help the community to make faster progress in the field of Li-S batteries by allowing proper benchmarking of results.Another approach when it comes to post-Li-ion batteries is to replace the conventional liquid with a solid electrolyte. (4) This should increase the safety of the cell, and it is believed that the energy density will also increase, as the solid electrolyte should be less prone to dendrite formation, so it could theoretically work with a metal anode. To date, much research is underway to find superionic conductors for Li and other M-ion batteries. Huang et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00315) are developing novel Na-ionic conductors based on NaMCl6 chemistry (with M = Nb and Ta) that achieve ionic conductivity up to 0.1 mS·cm–1 at RT. Zhao et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01145) used a slightly different chemistry based on sodium metal oxyhalides (NaMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta)) to further promote superionic conductors for Na-ion solid-state batteries. They obtained ionic conductivities around 1.5 mS·cm–1 at room temperature (RT). Unfortunately, they found that these solid electrolytes are unstable with respect to the Na metal electrode and can only be used in a composite electrode. Using density functional theory, Dutra et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01777) investigated the effect of the antiperovskite surface on the electrochemical performance of the materials. Based on this input, they demonstrated that Na3OCl material is a suitable material for superconducting due to its favorable ionic diffusion in the bulk and at the surface of the grains.On the lithium side of superionic conductors, Klenk et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01237) investigated the role of dopants in the well-known Li7La3Zr2O12 material. The aim of the dopants is to improve the overall ionic conductivity while at the same time achieving a better interfacial contact with the Li metal counter electrode. Using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy coupled with density function theory, the authors demonstrated the role of dopants in stabilizing the interface with Li metal. Working with a solid electrolyte posed another challenge related to the storage of the solid electrolyte prior to its use in the electrochemical system. In fact, some solid electrolytes, especially the sulfide family, are highly sensitive to air and moisture contamination. Kim et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01923) investigated the impact of a surface coating to buffer the degradation coming from air/moisture. By using atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating to deposit Al2O3 at the surface of the well-known argyrodite electrolyte Li6PS5Cl, they suppressed the hydrolysis process at the surface of the solid electrolyte. Alternative electrolytes can also be used as superionic conductors. Indeed, solid electrolytes have generally high ionic conductivity, but their shaping can be challenging, relying on densification or sintering at high temperature, and their electrochemical stability windows can be narrow. Polymers like electrolyte are far easier to manufacture but still suffer from poor ionic conductivity at room temperature, but their adhesion to Li metal is facilitated. Lingua et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01647) reported a polymer-like electrolyte with an ionic conductivity of ca. 3.10–6 S·cm–1 at RT, an electrochemical stability window up to 4.5 V vs Li+/Li, and a transference number close to 1. Proof-of-concept cells were shown to deliver a specific capacity higher than 100 mAh·g–1 for Li/polymer electrolyte/LiFePO4 cells at C/5 during 200 cycles.An additional challenge with solid-state batteries is the control of the various interfaces. Indeed, it is easy to understand the concept that a liquid will wet any surface it comes into contact with. For a solid, there are no \"wetting\" properties, so the contact between the ion carrier (i.e., the solid electrolyte) and the electroactive materials can only be achieved by an intimate mixture of the cell components. Stamenkovic et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01497) used a multi-approach technique to investigate the effect of the catholyte on the electrochemical performance of halide solid electrolytes and demonstrated that they can improve the overall reversibility of the system by tuning the oxidative redox mechanisms of the electrolyte.Finally, among the existing liquid electrolytes, the use of an aqueous electrolyte could solve most of the problems related to safety and cost. Unfortunately, the thermodynamic electrochemical stability window of water is very narrow, which has led research into the water-in-salt approach, (5) since saturating a water solution with salt can extend the stability windows up to 4 V. By using water-in-salt systems, Jommongkol et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01807) developed a novel polymer type that is pH-responsive to improve the cycle life of water-in-salt systems. The polymer can prevent water reduction, improving the cycling stability of Mo6S8 vs LiFePO4 cells, which deliver 87% of the specific discharge capacity after 100 cycles.Replacing a technology that won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 is not an easy task, as the number of parameters that must be considered to achieve progress is enormous. However, global warming and the expected expansion of the electric vehicle market call for new technologies that are more robust and/or cheaper. The so-called post-Li-ion batteries have a role to play in this transition, not by replacing the conventional Li-ion batteriesbut by finding their own niche applications. For example, water-in-salt systems could be suitable for storage applications, as they cannot compete with Li-ion batteries in energy density, but they can provide a cost-effective solution. Similarly, solid electrolytes can be cycled at very high temperatures, whereas conventional Li-ion batteries cannot. Compromises must be made about which technology to use for which application. All the contributions in this Special Issue open the door to new areas of research that will help to transform energy platforms in the near future.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorClaire Villevieille, Université Grenoble Alpes, Univ.

(American Association for the Advancement of Science) Lithium-ion batteries raise safety, environmental, and cost concerns, which mostly arise from their nonaq. electrolytes.

However, there is still a lack of a convenient platform that integrates X-ray imaging and NIR imaging in both bright- and dark-field applications. Here, a rare-earth ion-doped LaNbO4:Pr,Er photochromic luminescent material is developed, integrating X-ray-induced coloration, NIR-induced bleaching, photoluminescence, and luminescence modulation. Under alternating X-ray and NIR light irradiation, the reflectivity and luminescence intensity can be reversibly tuned to display four optical states: white, black, dark, and bright. By utilizing the switchable optical states, quad-mode imaging of X-ray and NIR in bright and dark fields is achieved. NIR-induced photobleaching imaging, when employed as adjuncts to X-ray-induced photochromic imaging, has the potential to significantly reduce radiation-induced damage to biological tissues. These results provide unique insights for designing advanced materials and photonic storage technologies toward advanced multiwavelength, multienvironment, and multimode noninvasive imaging.",

However, tuning the chemical structure of the organic cations to simultaneously improve the device performance and stability of 2D OIHP solar cells is rarely reported. Here, we demonstrate that by introducing a classic noncovalent aryl-perfluoroaryl interaction, 2D OIHP solar cells with 1:1 mixed phenethylammonium (PEA) and perfluorophenethylammonium (F5-PEA) can achieve an efficiency of >10% with much enhanced stability using a simple deposition at low temperature without using any additives. The competing effects of surface morphology and crystal orientation with an increased amount of F5-PEA result in the highest efficiency at a 1:1 ratio, while single-crystal studies reveal the expected aryl-perfluoroaryl interaction, accounting for the highest device stability of 2D OIHP solar cell at 1:1 ratio as well. This work provides an example where tuning the interactions of organic cations via molecular engineering can have a profound effect on device performance and stability of 2D OIHP solar cells.",

Big single-crystals can be successfully obtained and structurally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Here, metal-organic framework (MOF) containing open-metal sites (OMSs) are used as fillers that endow GPL simultaneously with high ionic conductivity (>1 mS cm–1) and a high Li+ transference number (up to 0.66), which results from immobilized anions and facilitated cation conduction by virtue of OMSs. Implementations of the GPL with OMSs-laden MOF in pseudo-solid-state batteries afford affinitive interfaces involving metallic Li and intercalation-type electrodes (LiFePO4, Li4Ti5O12), which contribute to significant improvements in battery durability and thereby could introduce a new type of MOF fillers for solid-state polymer electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "With downscaling of device dimensions, two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WS2 are being considered as promising materials for future applications in nanoelectronics. However, at these nanoscale regimes, incorporating TMD layers in the device architecture with precise control of critical features is challenging using current top-down processing techniques. In this contribution, we pioneer the combination of two key avenues in atomic-scale processing: area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) and growth of 2D materials, and demonstrate bottom-up processing of 2D WS2 nanolayers. Area-selective deposition of WS2 nanolayers is enabled using an ABC-type plasma-enhanced ALD process involving acetylacetone (Hacac) as inhibitor (A), bis(tert-butylimido)-bis(dimethylamido)-tungsten as precursor (B), and H2S plasma as the co-reactant (C) at a low deposition temperature of 250 °C. The developed AS-ALD process results in the immediate growth of WS2 on SiO2 while effectively blocking growth on Al2O3 as confirmed by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. As a proof of concept, the AS-ALD process is demonstrated on patterned Al2O3/SiO2 surfaces. The AS-ALD WS2 films exhibited sharp Raman (E2g1 and A1g) peaks on SiO2, a fingerprint of crystalline WS2 layers, upon annealing at temperatures within the thermal budget of semiconductor back-end-of-line processing (≤450 °C). Our AS-ALD process also allows selective growth on various TMDs and transition metal oxides while blocking growth on HfO2 and TiO2. It is expected that this work will lay the foundation for area-selective ALD of other 2D materials.",

Determining the intrinsic optical/electronic properties of 2D HOIPs is extremely important for further utility in photonic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we obtain the optical dielectric functions, complex refractive indices, and complex optical conductivities of both Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) and Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phases of 2D HOIPs, as a function of the perovskite QW thickness via spectroscopic ellipsometry over a broad energy range of 0.73–3.34 eV. We identify a series of feature peaks in the dielectric functions, and we explain the evolution of ground-state exciton peak with unit-cell thickness and changing excitonic confinement. We observe extraordinary values of optical extinction and electric loss tangents at the primary excitonic resonances and provide their detailed comparison with other known excitonic materials. Our study is expected to lay the foundation for understanding optical properties of pure-phase 2D HOIPs, which are critical and imperative for the accurate modelling of their photonic and optoelectronic devices.",

The suitability of a furan moiety for increasing the thermal and photostability in newly developed furan-based derivatives (BPBFCz) is demonstrated by comparing a well-known laser molecule (BSBCz) having a bis-stilbene unit. The new derivatives exhibited high photoluminescence quantum yields of nearly 100% and radiative rate constants of ∼109 s–1 in both solution and doped films, and their properties were also excellent in neat films. The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds of the BPBFCz materials were found to be very low (<1 μJ cm–2), and the excited-state absorption in the ASE oscillation region was negligible, which is preferable for laser applications. In addition to these excellent optical properties, which are comparable or superior to those of BSBCz, the decomposition temperatures of the BPBFCz emitters were much higher than that of BSBCz, resulting in the suppression of impurity formation during the thermal deposition. In addition, the photostability of the new materials was dramatically improved compared with that of BSBCz. This study serves as a very significant advancement toward the practical application of organic semiconductor laser diodes and provides molecular design guidelines for robust organic laser molecules.",

The synthesized membranes consist of a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) support and a TAPB-PDA-H, TAPB-PDA-Me, or TAPB-PDA-Et COF thin film. The latter two COFs direct six methyl and ethyl substituents per tiled hexagon into the pores, respectively, while maintaining the same topology across the series. These substituents decrease the effective pore size of the COF compared to the parent TAPB-PDA-H COF. The TFC TAPB-PDA-Me membrane rejects Rhodamine-WT (R-WT) dye and NaCl better than the TFC TAPB-PDA-H membrane, and the TFC TAPB-PDA-Et membrane exhibits the best rejection overall. The solution-diffusion model used to analyze this permeation behavior indicates that there is a systematic difference in rejection as subsequent pendant groups are added to the interior of the COF pores. These findings demonstrate the concept of tuning the selectivity of COF membranes by systematically reducing the effective pore size within a given topology.",

An ideal OER catalyst should possess optimal bindings to oxygenated intermediates, neither too strong nor too weak; however, the-state-of-the-art earth-abundant 3d first-row transition-metal-based OER catalysts still operate at overpotentials significantly above the thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we report a facile room temperature synthesis to prepare homogeneously dispersed, amorphous 3d multi-transition-metal alloys with tunable bindings to oxygenated species. The NiFeMoB alloy with near-optimal oxygenated intermediates adsorption energy exhibits the lowest OER overpotential of only 220 mV (with 95% solution resistance correction) at 500 mA/cm2 on nickel foam in an alkaline electrolyte, which shows no evidence of degradation at this current density following 40 h of continuous operation. By coupling an amorphous NiFeMoB oxygen-evolving anode with a crystalline NiB hydrogen-evolving cathode, we successfully demonstrate an alkaline water electrolysis cell that can be stably operated at a current density of 500 mA/cm2 with input voltage (without solution resistance correction) only around 1.72 V in 1 M KOH at room temperature and 1.57 V in 6 M KOH at 80 °C.",

    "abstract": "Optical imaging-guided chemo-photothermal combination therapy of cancers has attracted considerable attention, because of its capacity for personalized, precision treatment and its synergistic chemo-photothermal therapeutic effect. However, it still encounters many barriers, including an unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy, poor physiological stability, low drug loading, and uncontrolled drug release. Here, we developed a NIR-II dye-based multifunctional telechelic glycopolymer (TTQ-TC-PFru) as a drug carrier and constructed stimuli-responsive PFru-BTZ-PBOB nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve the near-infrared IIa (NIR-IIa, 1300-1400 nm) fluorescence imaging (FI)-guided chemo-photothermal combination therapy of cancers. This multifunctional glycopolymer not only serves as the contrast agent for NIR-IIa FI but also functions as the photothermal agent for photothermal therapy (PTT). Meanwhile, the fructose polymer on TTQ-TC-PFru forms a stable boronic acid-catechol conjugate with the dipeptidyl boronic acid proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) to achieve high drug loading (31%), satisfactory physiological stability, and controlled drug release in the acidic tumor microenvironment. In addition, one BOB-containing copolymer POEGMA-co-PBOB was introduced to further improve the stability of the system. In living tumor-bearing mice, the successfully constructed stimuli-responsive NPs PFru-BTZ-PBOB induced significant tumor regression through NIR-IIa FI-guided chemo-photothermal combination therapy. Our study thus describes the great potential of NIR-IIa FI-guided chemo-photothermal combination therapy of cancers.",

The structural coherence is revealed by the presence of satellite peaks accompanying Bragg reflections in wide-angle X-ray diffraction experiments in parallel-beam reflection geometry. The satellite peaks, also called \"superlattice reflections\", arise from the interference of X-rays diffracted by the atomic planes of the orthorhombic perovskite lattice. The interference is due to the precise spatial periodicity of the nanocrystals separated by organic ligands in the superlattice. The presence of satellite peaks is a fingerprint of the high crystallinity and long-range order of nanocrystals, comparable to those of multilayer superlattices prepared by physical methods. The angular separation between satellite peaks is highly sensitive to changes in the superlattice periodicity. These characteristics of the satellite peaks are exploited to track the superlattice compression under vacuum, as well as to observe the superlattice growth in situ from colloidal solutions by slow solvent evaporation.",

Imine COFs are a widely investigated class of COFs commonly synthesized via the Schiff base reaction that requires the use of acetic acid, elevated temperatures, reduced pressure, and long reaction periods. Here, we present group 14–15 metal halides as general and low-cost catalysts for the synthesis of imine COFs. The catalytic activity of lead, antimony, and bismuth halides is proved by the successful synthesis of a series of imine COFs with varying pore sizes and structural stability. Synthesis of highly crystalline COFs with surface areas up to 2522 m2/g is achieved. Mechanistic studies reveal that the dynamic imine exchange triggered by metal halides promotes the crystallization of COFs. The COF matrices formed under metal halide catalysis were used for in situ perovskite synthesis. The perovskite@COF composites maintain the integrity of COFs while enhancing the stability of perovskites by being embedded in COFs. This work expands the catalyst choice for imine-based COFs and provides a design paradigm for the synthesis of perovskite@COF composites for future applications.",

    "abstract": "Dense solid electrolytes in all-solid-state Li batteries are expected to suppress Li dendrite phenomena that prevent the application of high-energy-density Li metal electrodes. However, voids and cracks in sintered electrolytes still permit short-circuiting due to Li dendrites. This study aimed to investigate solid electrolytes with high formability in which green compacts can prevent Li dendrites. Li+ ion migration energies, bulk moduli, and energies above the hull were comprehensively investigated using first-principles and classical force field calculations as the indicators for ionic conductivity, formability, and thermodynamic stability. The 231 compounds containing Li and Cl listed in the Materials Project database were studied due to their high polarizability and weak Coulombic interaction with Li+ ions. Among them, monoclinic LiAlCl4 (LAC, S.G.: P121/c1) was focused on, owing to its low values of all three indicators. A mechanochemical synthesis was attempted to prepare the metastable phase, where Li ions occupy the interstitial sites, not just the original sites, because the computation for the migration energy suggested conductive pathways between the original Li sites. XRD and 7Li-MAS NMR measurements indicated that the mechanochemically synthesized LAC possessed a monoclinic host structure, while 2.5% Li occupied interstitial tetrahedral sites. Impedance measurements showed that the LAC green compacts exhibited an ionic conductivity of 2.1 × 10–5 S cm–1, 20 times higher than the conventional solid-state synthesized LAC at room temperature. The conductivity was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of garnet-type Li6.6La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 (LLZT), which has been attractive for the application of the sintered body for Li metal electrodes. The SEM observations and distribution of relaxation times analysis indicated that dense LAC green compacts with large necking between the particles contributed minimal grain-boundary resistance (7.5%) to the total resistance, while the LLZT green compacts contributed almost completely (99%).

However, the structure and phase transition behavior of these NCs remain poorly understood. Here, we provide unambiguous evidence that all these properties are associated with structural defects in NCs. Using CsPbCl3 NCs as a model system, we find that the cubic subdomains in highly defective NCs gradually convert to the orthorhombic upon cooling room-temperature quasi-cubic NCs, whereas high-quality cousins, with mixed cubic and orthorhombic subdomains at room temperature, exhibit a significant resistance for such a phase transition. Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations unveil the important role of point defects in triggering a stepwise, reversible phase transition of CsPbCl3 NCs. Importantly, we show that the defect-triggered phase transition also exists in other all-inorganic perovskite NCs. Our findings provide new insight into the structure and phase transition of CsPbX3 NCs and highlight the important role of defects in impacting these properties.",

    "abstract": "As an important type of crystalline solid proton-conducting material, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received immense attention in the scientific community. In general, such MOFs are designed with intrinsic (H3O+, NH4+, Me2NH2+, H2PO4–, OH– located in pores or dangling −SO3H, −COOH, and −PO3H2 groups as integral parts of the backbone) or extrinsic proton sources (imidazole, triazole, histamine, H3PO4, H2SO4 as guests). It has long been known that metal ions enhance the acidity of coordinated H2O molecules; however, such metal ion-bound water molecules as sole intrinsic proton sources for the construction of MOF-based conductors are largely unexplored. By exploiting such a design principle, herein, we report the proton-conduction properties of Mg-OBA MOF with the molecular formula {[Mg2(OBA)2(H2O)6]·2H2O}n [OBA = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid)], where half of the octahedral coordination sites around Mg(II) centers are occupied by water molecules. The 2D layered structure with hydrophilic interlayer spaces within the framework having abundant water coordination as the sole proton sources makes extended H-bonding pathway for efficient protons migration and thus exhibiting ultrahigh conductivity with the value of 1.27 × 10–2 S cm–1 at 80 °C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The activation energy (Ea = 0.13 eV) obtained is one of the lowest of MOF-based proton conductors suggesting facile proton transfer. Besides, this material is quite robust and easy to scale up in the aqueous medium.",

However, its mechanical properties limit its application to a great extent—energy dissipation mechanisms are not provided by the carbon network for external strain and it easily cracks. Herein, inspired by the very structure of the avian nest, we report a durable and nondisposable transparent graphene skin electrode for detecting electrophysiological signals, which was fabricated by semi-embedding highly graphitized electrospun fiber/monolayer graphene (GFG) into soft elastomer. Because of the semi-embedded structure and strong interaction between annealed electrospun fiber and graphene through graphitization, as-fabricated conductive film demonstrated high conductivity and transparency (∼150 Ω/□ at 83% transmittance), as well as a stable electrical performance under mechanical vibrations (strain, peel-off, stir, etc.). It can be used to reliably collect vital biometric signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), surface electromyogram (sEMG), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Furthermore, the semi-embedded GFG in the elastomer demonstrated excellent washability (rinsing/stirring in water) and repeatability (∼10 repeats) with high signal-to-noise ratio (up to 30 dB) while detecting sEMG. This is the first report of durable and transparent graphene skin electrode for biometric signals detection, revealing potential opportunities in wearable healthcare applications.",

Current strategies, such as electrodeposition, electrospinning, and chemical-vapor-deposition methods, for fabricating MEESDs still encounter the persistent limitations on low fabrication efficiency, tedious preparation procedure, and non-scalability. To address this challenge, the new emerging three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has been developed for customizable MEESDs because of its scalability, low-cost, high manufacturing efficiency, and complexity capability. Among the 3D printing technologies, a direct-ink-writing (DIW) technique with well-controlled geometry and architecture of the electrode structures, is an ideal tool for building high-efficient MEESDs via designing the ink components and regulating the device configurations. In light of this, our Perspective provides fundamental insights into rational printable inks design principles towards high-performance MEESDs. We start the discussion on the design principle of printable inks, and the selection criteria for electrode materials and electrolytes inks. Then, the recent progress in fabricating the high-performance MEESDs via the DIW technology is summarized. Finally, the existing problems and future perspectives on functional MEESDs fabrication are also discussed. We envision that this review serves as the basic design principles of 3D printing ink for the rational design of high-efficient MEESDs.",

One of the bottlenecks lying in the surface catalytic process involves the acquisition and utilization of activated hydrogen (H*). Herein, a strategy regarding ameliorative H* supply for promoting photocatalytic N2 fixation was realized by utilizing the Pt-doped Ag nanoparticles supported on TiO2 (AgPt–TiO2). Irradiation of AgPt–TiO2 in N2-saturated water produced NH3 at a rate of 38.4 μmol g–1 h–1, which has a 7.7-fold increase compared with the value for pristine TiO2. The dramatically enhanced activity of AgPt–TiO2 results from the sufficient H* supply, thereby boosting significantly N2 hydrogenation and promoting ammonia formation. The promising strategy adopted here could be employed to regulate and acquire activated hydrogen of other efficient photocatalysts for N2 fixation and other photocatalytic reactions (e.g., CO2 conversion and hydrogen peroxide production).",

The cationic COF possesses unconventional electrostatic functions due to the ionic interface over the skeletons.

Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the doping-induced structural phase transition results from the dopant-enabled release of lattice strain and a temperature-insensitive local structural change in the doped region of NCs. Since size mismatch between dopants and replaced ions widely exists in doped functional materials, our finding may not be limited to halide perovskite NCs, but could have implications even for other classes of doped NCs and bulk materials.",

Regulation of the type, distribution, and quantity of defects within the crystal allows for refinement of material properties, which, in turn, affects the performance of semiconductor devices. Looking back at the development in the realm of perovskite, the research on defect behaviors has always been closely linked to the outstanding improvements in solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and other devices. Recently, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of red, green, and blue perovskite LEDs have approached the efficiency limit after comprehensive defect suppression strategies. The research emphasis on perovskite LEDs has gradually shifted from efficiency improvement to stability improvement, as well as defect formation and passivation mechanisms. However, existing views on the origin and action of defects are contradictory. In this Review, we focus on the origins and negative effects of defects from the perspective of LEDs performance; we also summarize the defect passivation strategies developed in recent studies. Given the universality of defects, a cogent summary of defect behaviors may help to further improve the performance of perovskite LEDs and promote the development of other optoelectronic devices.",

Critical challenges for solid-state lithium-metal batteries include the large morphological changes associated with the plating and stripping of lithium metal and decomposition of the solid electrolyte, because of the reductive nature of the lithium metal, both increasing the lithium metal–solid electrolyte interface resistance. This is especially challenging when starting in the discharged state with a bare anode or \"anode-less\" current collector facing the solid electrolyte. To overcome this, a 100-nm thin layer of ZnO is deposited on the copper current collector with atomic layer deposition (ALD). During the first charge, this results in more homogeneous lithium-metal growth, rationalized by the formation of a Zn–Li alloy that acts as seed crystals for the lithium metal. The resulting more homogeneous lithium-metal growth maintains better contact with the solid electrolyte, leading to more reversible cycling of lithium metal. Minor prelithiating of the ZnO/Cu anode with 1 mAh/cm2 further improves the cycling performance, as demonstrated in a full all-solid-state cell using LiFePO4 as a cathode, resulting in an average Coulombic efficiency of >95%. These findings mark the first steps in an interface strategy to overcome the challenges at the solid electrolyte/lithium-metal interface in solid-state lithium-metal batteries.",

Seleninic acid, the oxidation product of Se–Se bonds, can disturb the redox hemostasis and regulate protein expression in cancer cells. In this Viewpoint, we briefly introduced the significance and applications of diselenide-containing polymers in combined anticancer treatment. Furthermore, we envisioned the future challenges and directions of diselenide-containing drug delivery systems.",

However, the low conductivity of perovskite NCs thin film is regarded as the Achilles' heel, hindering further development in electronic usage. To address this issue, we employed sequential treatments of methyl acetate soft soaking and Ostwald ripening on CsPbBr3 NC thin films, which improve the transport property and dramatically enhance the carrier lifetime from 11.56 to 112.5 ns. The field-effect transistor (FET) based on resulting CsPbBr3 NCs thin film exhibits p-type carrier mobility of 0.023 cm2 V–1 s–1 and ON/OFF ratio up to ∼104, which is on par with the bulk perovskite-based FETs. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the p-type CsPbBr3 NCs feature high gas-sensing selectivity to detect NO2 with a detection limit down to 0.4 ppm. The appealing charge-transport properties of these CsPbBr3 NCs underscore their potentials for versatile applications.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary implantable bioelectronic devices are typically made of high-quality metals and inorganic materials. However, their rigid and flat nature, especially in their bulk state, pose critical challenges for long-term signal monitoring and feedback stimulation in vivo because of the following issues: (i) nonconformal contact with the tissue surface, (ii) mechanical modulus mismatch at the biotic-abiotic interface, and (iii) chronic immune response and potential inflammatory reactions. Therefore, to develop implantable bioelectronics with long-term stability in vivo, the mechanical properties of the devices should be extremely soft and similar to those of the tissues. Such features have been achieved by adopting ultrathin and stretchable device structures and strain-dissipative materials. More recently, multifunctional materials that feature softness, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and self-healing capabilities have been applied to various electronic implants. Herein, we provide a brief review of soft implantable bioelectronic devices, particularly those that form a conformal and robust interface with target tissues, such as the brain, heart, and peripheral nerves. Strategies for soft materials, deformable device designs, and other methods for long-term implantation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Hyperfluorescence has received significant attention as a promising strategy to design organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and enhanced stability. In this approach, emitters displaying strong and narrow-band fluorescence are integrated in thin films that contain sensitizers showing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). To ensure high performance, the energies of the electronic states in the fluorescent emitters must be well-aligned, with respect to those in the TADF molecules, in order to enable a fast rate of Förster singlet-exciton energy transfer from the latter to the former. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations to study a series of fluorescent emitters commonly considered in hyperfluorescence OLEDs. For all these emitters, the lowest triplet excited state (T1FE) is found to locate substantially below the lowest singlet excited state (S1FE). However, the second and/or third triplet excited states (T2FE and T3FE) appear at an energy close to that of S1FE; thus, while energy loss via triplet-exciton Dexter energy transfer from T1 in TADF molecules to T1FE is negligible, it can become significant due to Dexter transfer to T2FE and/or T3FE. As a result, we propose that fluorescent emitters be designed with a large energy gap between T2FE/T3FE and S1FE, as a promising strategy to suppress any Dexter energy-loss mechanism and develop highly efficient hyperfluorescence-based optoelectronic devices.",

Unfortunately, insights into the structural evolution and structure–property relationship of such copper nanoclusters are scant, because of the difficulty of synthesizing and crystallizing nanoclusters with high nuclearity and new morphologies. Here, we report an anisotropic cuboidal polyhydrido copper nanocluster, [Cu23(PhSe)16(Ph3P)8(H)6]·BF4, with a distorted cuboctahedral Cu13 core stabilized by two square protecting motifs and six hydrides. The cuboidal nanoclusters self-assemble into a quasi-simple cubic packing pattern with perfect face-to-face contact of neighboring nanoclusters and interdigitation of intercluster surface ligands. Atomic-level observations reveal the crucial role that subtle synergies between nanocluster geometry and intercluster noncovalent interactions play in guiding nanocluster self-assembly. In addition, a comparison with previously reported analogous metal nanoclusters points to bulky monodentate phosphine ligands as a potent inducing agent for the formation of rectangular hexahedral nanoclusters. These findings have significant implications for the controllable synthesis of polyhedral nanomaterials and their superstructures.",

Here, LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) at 4.8 V, employing p-toluenesulfonyl isocyanate (PTSI) as an electrolyte additive, has been investigated, which shows much improved cycling capabilities and rate performances for long-term cycling when a cell voltage of 4.8 V is applied. On the basis of the electrochemical analysis results and the first-principles calculation, the product CH3C6H4NCO from PTSI can be polymerized to produce a polymer (CH3C6H4NCO)2 to generate a stable solid electrolyte interphase film on the NCM523 cathode, which inhibits the decomposition of the electrolyte upon cycling at 4.8 V and offers a long-term cycling performance over 680 cycles.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the development of conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have sparked interest in a variety of applications that leverage electronic materials due to the inherent tunability, porosity, and crystallinity associated with these materials. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) comprise an emerging class of complementary porous materials that assemble crystalline networks mainly from intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions; however, relatively few reports on functional HOFs exist as these reversible interactions are much weaker than the coordination or covalent bonds found in the former frameworks, which presents additional challenges in the isolation and activation of HOFs. In this work, we introduce an approach to access a permanently porous HOF derived from a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) core, which is the first HOF reported to date that exhibits electrical conductivity. Upon precipitation from solution, HOF-110 self-assembles in a preferred orientation that contains vertical columns of TTF dimers, and the postsynthetic incorporation of iodine within the nanoporous channels of this framework affords pressed pellet conductivity values of up to 6.0 × 10–7 S·cm–1, which is an almost 30-fold improvement compared with pressed pellets of the pristine framework. Extensive structural characterization studies suggest the presence of radical mixed-valence TTF/TTF·+ species within these materials, which is consistent with previous reports on analogous TTF-based MOFs and COFs. Overall, this work presents a viable strategy to develop robust, electrically conductive frameworks built from purely intermolecular interactions, further expanding the toolbox available for the assembly of functional porous materials.",

It has been reported that a favorable electronic structure and high electrical conductivity contribute to obtaining superior electrocatalytic activity for perovskites; thus, effective strategies for engineering abundant beneficial factors must be explored to enhance HER and OER. Hence, we report a novel two-step solid-state phase reaction method combined with bulk doping for constructing perovskite LaxSr1–xFe1–20yCo19yPyO3−δ-ab (LSFCP-ab) with modest B–O length and high electrical conductivity. Induced by the strong charge redistribution via Fe4+-O2–x-Co3+, abundant active sites (O22–/O–, Fe4+, Co3+/Co4+), moderate adsorption and desorption energies of the intermediates are obtained during OER and HER. Besides, the activated surface lattice oxygen O2-x could participate in the OER with lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM). Consequently, the optimal LSFCP-55 exhibits improved intrinsic OER and HER activity than that of La0.2Sr0.8FeO3-δ (LSF). Furthermore, the cell possesses a small cell voltage of 1.57 V with superior durability when it employed as the bifunctional catalyst in overall water splitting.

By regulation of the cation–anion structure of the ionic polymine, the sensor exhibits superior preconcentration capacity and achieves accurate monitoring of iodine with a low detection limit.

On the basis of this idea, a new NLO crystal NaHC4O4·H2O is found by using the first-principles high-throughput screening pipeline for nonlinear optical materials (FHSP-NLO). It is the first NLO crystal found in squarates. Subsequently, the crystal with a size of 30 × 6 × 5 mm was grown by a facile aqueous solution method. NaHC4O4·H2O shows a strong powder SHG effect of 2.3 × KDP and a giant birefringence of 0.52 at 1064 nm. Electronic structure calculation and analysis reveal that the π orbitals of the (HC4O4)− groups are the dominant source of the SHG coefficient. This study provides novel NLO-active units and a materials system to design and find NLO crystals.",

    "abstract": "The quest for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with low operating voltage has become highly compelling in many application areas, such as medical sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID), wearable and stretchable technologies, etc. To this end, considerable efforts have been devoted to decreasing the operation voltage of OFETs while retaining high performance over the last few decades. This Review focuses on the recent progress in the field of low-voltage OFETs. The critical factors to realize low-voltage OFETs are analyzed systematically through establishing the relationships between the operation voltage and subthreshold swing. Further on the strategic approaches for lowering the operation voltage, increasing gate dielectric capacitance, reducing the trap density within the semiconductor layer or at device interfaces, and using the negative capacitor effect, are summarized and discussed. We conclude with an overview of these critical methods and the key challenges to enable the laboratory-to-production transition.",

    "abstract": "CeO2 has played an important role in improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of transition metals-based catalysts whether as a hybrid, substrate, or interface. The high OER activity is ascribed to the optimized transition metals and/or the formed oxygen vacancies. In this work, the interface effect between CoO and CeO2 is reported to be the reason for the excellent OER performance of CoO/CeO2. Compared with sole CoO or CoO/CeO2-L (larger CoO nanosheets), CoO/CeO2 has exhibited higher OER performance due to the faster kinetics and higher OER intrinsic activity because of the large amount of Co/Ce interfaces. Theoretical calculations reveal the generation of the reconstructed active center of the Co–O–Ce configuration due to the strong electron coupling effect between CeO2 and CoO. The Co–O–Ce hybridization at the interface brings in the unoccupied oxygen states, acting as the acceptor-like states and optimizing the bonding energy with OER intermediates. The findings give an avenue to design excellent CeO2-containing OER catalysts through interface control.",

Herein, we reported a facile strategy for the large-scale preparation of Cu single-atom catalysts via a solid-state pyrolysis strategy, with a Cu content of 3.86 wt %. The Cu single atoms were coordinated by four nitrogen atoms, which allowed to accelerate water dissociation to form *H species and stabilize key intermediates toward CH4. The Cu single-atom catalyst exhibited an excellent CO2-to-CH4 electroreduction performance, including a Faradaic efficiency of 68.2%, a high partial current density of 493.1 mA cm–2, and a good electrochemical stability.

Toward this end, we designed and synthesized a series of CuZn-based aerogel materials with controlled Cu/Zn ratios and systematically investigated their effects on CO2RR catalysis. From both experimental results and theoretical calculations, we found that the introduction of Zn into Cu aerogel greatly promoted the production of CO primarily due to the unfavorable adsorption energy of *H. Surprisingly, the intake of trace Ni atoms further inhibited the H2 evolution reaction on account of the strong pinning of both *H and H2O* on the Ni sites. Therefore, the as-formed CuZn-Ni aerogel exhibited a much-improved catalytic activity and selectivity for CO generation with FE(CO) increased to 80% from 60%. This work gives insights into the surface adsorption–desorption characteristics underlying the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, which is of general importance for CO2RR.",

Despite much effort, several lingering issues, such as device efficiency and stability, are still needed to be solved for the commercial application. Ionic liquids with unique properties, such as high ionic conductivity, good thermal stability, and chemical designability, have shown to play multiple functions for high-efficiency and stable PSCs. In this Review, we first introduce the structure and property of typical ionic liquids. Then, we comprehensively discuss the various applications of ionic liquids and their derivatives in perovskite layers, hole-transporting layers (HTL), and electron-transporting layers (ETL) of PSCs, as additives, solvents, dopants, surface modifiers and independent charge-transporting materials, with particular emphasis on the interaction between ionic liquids and function layers of PSCs, such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, coordinate bonds, and so on, as well as the relationship between molecular structures of ionic liquids and the photovoltaic performances of PSCs. Finally, we address the conclusions and an outlook for the future development of this field. It is expected that this Review will stimulate a generation of new thoughts and ideas on the emerging challenges and opportunities of ionic liquids-based PSCs.",

The goal of this work is to theoretically screen out promising electrically pumped organic laser compounds over both MR-TADF and conventional TADF molecules. We calculate the photophysical parameters over 21 organic TADF molecules to determine if the electrically pumped lasing criteria can be met, i.e., no substantial absorption/annihilation processes caused by excitons and polarons near the S1 emission wavelength. The selection criteria include large oscillator strength of S1, large net emission cross-section, long S1 lifetime, and large reverse intersystem crossing rate. We are able to conclude that DABNA-2, m-Cz-BNCz, ADBNA-Me-Mes, and ADBNA-Me-Tips MR-TADF molecules are prospective candidates for electrically pumped lasing based on our theoretical protocol, and we believe this work would immediately benefit this field with better and more efficient molecular design of TADF gain materials.",

Despite LGPS exhibiting a remarkably high room-temperature Li-ion conductivity, comparable to that of the liquid electrolytes used in current Li-ion batteries, nanoscale effects in this material have not been fully explored. Here, we predict that nanosizing of LGPS can be used to further enhance its Li-ion conductivity. By utilizing state-of-the-art nanoscale modeling techniques, our results reveal significant nanosizing effects with the Li-ion conductivity of LGPS increasing with decreasing particle volume. These features are due to a fundamental change from a primarily one-dimensional Li-ion conduction mechanism to a three-dimensional mechanism and major changes in the local structure. For the smallest nanometric particle size, the Li-ion conductivity at room temperature is three times higher than that of the bulk system. These findings reveal that nanosizing LGPS and related solid electrolytes could be an effective design approach to enhance their Li-ion conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Metal chalcogenides, oxides, and halides are the three most typical materials classes for mid-infrared nonlinear optical (mid-IR NLO) crystals that can expand the spectral ranges of solid-state lasers to the mid-IR region. However, it is difficult for each of them to satisfy all the property requirements of mid-IR NLO crystals owing to their own defects. On the contrary, combining multiple anionic units as much as possible to construct heteroanionic compounds is an effective strategy for the design of new high-performance IR NLO crystals. Although in recent research, a series of heteroanionic materials containing two types of anions (i.e., chalcogenides-halides, oxychalcogenides, and oxyhalides) have been reported, the compounds that contain all three types of anions have still been unexplored. Herein, we report the first IR NLO crystal [Ba2F2][Ge2O3S2], which contains all three typical anions (O2–, S2–, and F–) and satisfies the key property requirements as a promising IR NLO candidate, including a strong SHG response (∼1.4× AgGaS2), a large band gap (Eg = 4.45 eV), and wide IR transmission (0.24–9.0 μm). This research indicates that coupling different types of anions in one compound is a more attractive strategy to explore new IR NLO materials with excellent properties.",

However, the strong hydrogen binding at Ni site (Ni–H) limits its electrocatalytic HOR activity. Herein, ruthenium (Ru) is introduced to regulate the surface electronic structure of Ni and optimize the Ni–H. Simultaneously, constructing the interfacial-oxygen (O) configuration endows Ni with suitable oxophilic components to optimize the adsorption energy for surface hydroxyl species (OH*). The density functional theory (DFT) simulation and characterization results confirm that electron transfer from Ni to Ru causes the d-band center of Ni to shift down, weakening the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE), which synergistically contributes the enhanced HOR performance for the optimal O-RuNi@C-400 with a diffusion-limiting current density of 2.87 mA cm–2 and mass activity of 601 mA mg–1PGM at an overpotential of 50 mV, which is ∼1.20 and 7.90 times higher than that of Pt/C, respectively. Besides, because of the protective shell of oxophilic Ni–O–C interface to reduce the affinity with CO, O-RuNi@C-400 exhibits better CO tolerance (1000 ppm) than that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, making it a promising HOR electrocatalyst for hydrogen fuel cells.",

    "abstract": "Improving the catalytic activity and broadening the scope of nanozymes are prerequisites to supplement or even supersede natural enzymes. However, the discovery of nanozymes is mostly relied on serendipity with limited fine-tunings of chemical composition, which is often incomprehensive and fragmented. Machine learning (ML) is a promising solution to predict the nanozyme performance and thus accelerate the nanozyme development. Herein, a thorough investigation of the peroxidase (POD) mimic reaction catalyzed by nonmetal atom doped graphdiyne (GDY) is presented and two doped GDYs (B-GDY and N-GDY) with best performance were screened out. Specifically, the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm can mine the connection between the model parameters and maximum energy barrier (R2 > 78%) or maximum energy consuming step (accuracy > 65%) from the data set constructed by all the nonmetal atom doped GDYs, which provides a method to effectively reduce 20% calculations. In addition, six nonmetal atom doped GDYs with different expected properties were synthesized, and their activity trends in three related experiments were consistent with the predicted results. This study demonstrates that ML can be a useful tool to assist density functional theory (DFT) computational screening and can serve as a guide for optimizing nanozyme performance, depending on doping strategy.",

    "abstract": "Development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with greater energy density is of particular interest, but the anode choice is very limited, because of the failure of graphite in storing sodium. Although the alloying-type anodes demonstrate much higher capacity than the carbon anodes, the severe capacity fading hinders their applications. Herein, we present a novel alloying/conversion-based anode, where a conversion-type metal oxide (e.g., MnO) microdumbbell framework modified by a carbon layer was designed to stabilize the high-capacity alloying (e.g., Sn) nanoparticles. Combined with an electrolyte engineering approach, the as-designed Sn-MnO@C anode demonstrates a superior performance to store sodium, including a high capacity of 370 mAh g–1, extraordinary rate capacities over 10 A g–1, and a long lifespan of over 500 cycles. The high performance of the Sn-MnO@C anode in the SIB was further confirmed when the sodium vanadium phosphate-based cathode was paired. We demonstrate the importance of the synergistic effect of electrode structural design and electrolyte engineering (i.e., tuning Na+-solvent-anion complex) for attaining greater performance. This study opens a new avenue to preparing novel framework-supported functional materials and also offers a new opportunity to examine the electrolyte performance, facilitating the design of SIBs with greater power energy densities.",

On the basis of CsPbI3 PNCs, we analyze the main instability factors of red-emissive PNCs (620–720 nm), including their structures, optoelectronic properties, and instability mechanism. We then summarize some strategies to improve the stability and performance of the perovskites and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Furthermore, we discuss the challenge of scaling up the production of PNCs. Finally, we propose possible perspectives for the development of perovskite materials.",

    "abstract": "Recently, small-size photodetectors have attracted considerable attention, because of their promising potential for superintegrated circuits in the photoelectric sensor system. However, the small size may disable the photodetectors or result in low photoelectric conversion efficiency, because of the optical diffraction limit and the inefficient light absorption. Encouragingly, plasmonic nanostructures take excellent advantage of light-confinement effect and electric fields enhancement at the nanoscale, providing huge opportunities to achieve small-size photodetectors while maintaining high device performance (broad photodetection range, high photoresponsivity, and fast response speed). This Review highlights the state-of-the art progress in the development of photodetectors based on various plasmonic structures. Since surface plasmons are well-controlled by the shape, size, and component of nanostructures, special emphasis will be put on the rational regulation of plasmonic nanostructures including metal nanostructures, doped semiconductors, and graphene to achieve high-performance photodetectors. In addition, the underlying enhanced mechanism is also discussed. Finally, we highlight the challenges that require deeper insights into the underlying plasmon enhanced mechanism, develop inexpensive plasmonic nanostructures for practical application, and need more research on plasmonic photodetectors based on nonmetal nanostructures and provide perspectives for future research. This Review may provide guidance for rational design of plasmonic nanostructures for small-size photodetectors with high performance.",

Transparent and stretchable gels with ionic conductivities are considered to be ideal candidates for flexible pressure sensors. However, the gel-based pressure sensors usually show a relatively narrow detection range, which significantly limits their practical applications. Herein, we report an unprecedented bioinspired highly flexible modulus/conductivity-dual-gradient poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) ionogel, which is achieved by constructing three layers of PIL ionogels with different monomer concentrations via a layer-by-layer gelation method. The flexible pressure sensor based on the gradient PIL ionogel exhibits an ultrabroad detection range of 10 Pa–1 MPa. This wearable pressure sensor is highly stable in environments and able to monitor both the tiny pressures as low as 10–100 Pa and the high pressures up to 0.1–1 MPa during human body movements. This work provides a powerful strategy for the preparation of flexible gradient materials that are promising for wearable electronics with a wide pressure detection range.",

Although an insufficient population and fast nonradiative decay of triplet excitons are avoided in recent endeavors, complicated synthesis and limited universality still hinder its development. Further, fluid RTP materials are more difficult to design because of faster nonradiative relaxation. Herein, a deep eutectic mixture of glucose and choline, a stable supercooled liquid at room temperature, is employed as a matrix. Direct transformation from commercial fluorescent dyes to RTP fluid is realized by doping without modifications. The excited triplet states are generated by an external heavy atom, while the rigid noncovalent network stabilizes them with both functions intrinsic to the liquid matrix. Modulation of matrix components also results in nearly white light emission of a single dye. This study presents a general strategy to design fluid RTP materials starting from the vast library of fluorophores.",

    "abstract": "Quantum two-dimensional (2D) materials discovered in the early 21st century have outsmarted existing nanomaterials in various frontiers of applications. Among the preparation of 2D materials, molecular beam epitaxy, atomic layer deposition, and chemical vapor deposition are nonscalable costly methods, whereas sonochemical and Hummer’s exfoliation methods provide functionalized sheets. Conversely, ultrafast liquid-phase laser processing promises quick delivery of defect-free 2D quantum materials. We report photoexfoliation synthesis of atomic graphene layers, boron nitride (BN), and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) by the intense KrF laser irradiation into aqueous dispersions of parent material powders in DMF taken in quartz beakers. The number of atomic layers and the lateral size of the sheets gradually decrease with an increase in the laser irradiation duration. Also, the laser fluence becomes the critical control parameter of the lateral size and the number of layers. The average lateral size shrinks from ∼400 nm at 1.5 J/cm2 to 20–30 nm at 4 J/cm2, which accompanies a surge in the ratio of sheets with fewer layers. We correlate the laser processing parameters with the sample size and analyze the molecule-atom-scale interactions. Simulation and DFT calculations suggest the mild out-of-plane thermal expansion of atomic layers followed by solvent intercalation stretches interlayer distance to ∼6.68 Å and thereby lowers the activation energy of exfoliation. The optimum photon fluence at the solvent-assisted condition reduces the activation barrier, enabling us to synthesize 2D crystals in the solution phase. Photoexfoliation synthesis of pure crystals of 2D materials can be promising for next-generation electronic devices.",

Diverse operando observations clearly show that the novel multifunctional binder mitigates the microstructural changes of silicon at nanoscale and microscale levels compared to conventional linear binders, resulting in a high electrochemical performance of approximately 1100 mAh g–1 even after 1000 cycles.

    "abstract": "It is a trend to construct multicomponent room temperature phosphorescence/RTP doped materials in the future to improve phosphorescence performance by using the advantage that the host in the doped system can be used as a container containing other components. Herein, the multicomponent doped systems are constructed with two isoquinoline derivatives (OxISQ and PrISQ) as the guests, diphenyl sulfoxide/SDB as the host, and alkali (KOH) as the fourth component. Bicomponent doped material OxISQ/SDB has strong cyan RTP, whereas PrISQ/SDB has almost no RTP activity. The effect of KOH on the phosphorescence intensity of OxISQ/SDB is excitation-dependent. When λex = 365 nm, KOH turns off the phosphorescence emission, revealing the intensity of KOH-added three-component doped material OxISQ/SDB/KOH is significantly weaker than that of OxISQ/SDB, whereas KOH exhibits the turn-on property for OxISQ/SDB at λex = 385 nm. For PrISQ/SDB, KOH displays permanent turn-on ability, and PrISQ/SDB/KOH has strong yellow-orange RTP. More deeply, a two-guest four-component doped system OxISQ/PrISQ/SDB/KOH is constructed, and from OxISQ/PrISQ/SDB to OxISQ/PrISQ/SDB/KOH, with the increase of KOH, the phosphorescence colors gradually change from cyan to green to yellow to orange at λex = 365 nm, but the color only can change directly from cyan to yellow-orange at λex = 385 nm. In addition, OxISQ/PrISQ/SDB/KOH exhibited a time-dependent afterglow color from orange-yellow to cyan over 2 s due to the different phosphorescence lifetime, intensity, and wavelength of each component. The experimental results confirmed that phenylhydroxyl-containing guests react with KOH to form organic salts, thereby inducing new excitation and emission wavelengths in the doped materials. This work is the first to construct a four-component doped system with dual guests that can undergo chemical reactions. Moreover, taking advantage of the water solubility of KOH, the doped materials have achieved advanced anticounterfeiting writing and printing in the aqueous phase.",

Accordingly, one can infer the extraordinary flexibility of PDMS. However, the mechanism of the extraordinary flexibility is still unclear at present. Herein the single-chain mechanics of PDMS is measured by single-molecule atomic force microscopy, which is consistent with the results from quantum mechanical calculations. Then, the effects of several factors of microscopic structures of PDMS on the macroscopic mechanical properties are qualitatively analyzed. With the extremely low elasticity of the individual chain, the large effective cross-sectional area, and the very weak intra/interchain noncovalent interactions and their synergistic effect, the relatively small modulus of PDMS is reasonable. We further propose a method to estimate the modulus of an extended chain crystal of a polymer from the single-chain force–extension curve. For the polymer crystals in which only van der Waals forces are involved in the intra/interchain noncovalent interactions, the estimated moduli are very close to the measured values, which indicates that this method should be valid for PDMS. It is found that the estimated modulus of PDMS is smaller than those of most polymers, which directly shows its extraordinary flexibility at the macroscopic level. This work may be helpful for bridging the gap between the single-molecule and macroscopic properties of polymer materials.",

The combination of PTT and chemotherapy could effectively improve the therapeutic effect. Herein, we report a prodrug-hemicyanine conjugate (Cy-azo) to achieve H-aggregation improved photothermal therapy and sequential hypoxia-activated chemotherapy. Due to the introduction of the chemotherapeutic drug, nitrogen mustard, Cy-azo demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE, 39.3%) caused by the enhanced H-aggregation of the prodrug through π–π stacking. Moreover, the activated drug is released in the tumor hypoxic microenvironment, which can kill cancer cells and greatly reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy. In addition, Cy-azo is further encapsulated into polymer nanoparticles to stabilize the Cy-azo H-aggregates and increase the tumor accumulation of Cy-azo through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Interestingly, Cy-azo NPs show an enhanced PCE as 56.1% and demonstrate an excellent anticancer therapeutic effect under 808 nm light irradiation. The combination of PTT with hypoxia-activated chemotherapy is promising for anticancer treatment and would guide future development of prodrugs for combined PTT and chemotherapy.",

However, monodispersed MHP NCs generally possess a halogen-deficient surface and are capped by labile long-chain organic ligands, exhibiting low charge transfer rates to nearby cocatalysts in photocatalytic systems. Conventional methods of removing the surface ligands easily bring new surface defects, leading to serious charge recombination and low photocatalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile halogen compensation method to obtain high-quality CsPbBr3 NCs with a Br-filled surface toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The use of reactive thionyl bromide (SOBr2) not only promotes the stripping of native ligands but also repairs Br vacancies (VBr) on CsPbBr3 NCs. Such a halogen compensation method facilitates the charge transfer from CsPbBr3 NCs to nearby cocatalysts (e.g., g-C3N4), resulting in a high CO/CH4 production rate of 190 μmol g–1 h–1 in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work provides a new strategy to simultaneously enhance the surface properties of photocatalysts and build a favorable interface for their charge transfer, showing great potential in the design and application of perovskites NCs for photocatalytic applications.",

However, like most of their properties, the WF of MXenes highly depends on their surface terminations, making it hard to individually modify the WF without compromising other fundamental properties, which hinders the exploitation of MXenes to their full potential. Herein, we introduce a surface-termination-independent method to tune the WF of Ti3C2Tx MXene through molecular doping. The achieved stepwise 500-meV increase in WF, in ∼120-meV increments, is induced by subsurface electron depletion from Ti3C2Tx, with no effect on its other key properties. Utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance and ultrafast laser spectroscopy, we reveal that tuning the WF of Ti3C2Tx is entirely surface-termination-independent. Such discrete control over the WF renders MXene-based devices with unprecedented operational degrees of freedom.",

Due to limited absorption dissymmetry (gabs) in the chiral active layers, exploring the prospect of creating additional gsc in chiral electronic devices is becoming increasingly relevant. In particular, rationalizing the corresponding amplification mechanisms is still challenging. Here, we achieve accurate CPL detection through an amplified gsc from bulk heterojunction (BHJ) small-molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) with supramolecular chirality. The alternating preferential and nonpreferential CPL illuminations cause a difference in maximum absorption position across the chiral active layer, resulting in differences in exciton separation and charge recombination, transport, and collection. These differences contribute to additional difference in photocurrent output and the amplified gsc in the chiral OSCs. From the perspective of device structure, our study likely provides insights into the amplified gsc in chiral electronic devices for direct CPL detection.",

Reversible switching phenomena between glassy and crystalline states further extends the potential application space, prospectively, to memory, computing, photonics, metamaterials, and phase change energy storage. To better identify the characteristic switching properties, the underlying kinetics of glass crystallization is studied for an exemplary glass-forming (S)-(−)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylammonium lead bromide (SNPB) perovskite, using a combination of calorimetry, microscopy, and kinetic modeling techniques. The study shows an activation energy of ∼350 kJ/mol for the glass-crystalline transition and an Avrami parameter of n = 2.02 ± 0.11, and points to heterogeneous surface-mediated nucleation of crystallites with two-dimensional laminar growth in space. These results serve as an initial guide toward modeling the glass-crystallization kinetic effects in MHPs and to facilitate assessment of the suitability of the glass-forming MHPs for a broad range of prospective applications.",

By using a liquid–liquid interface polymerization strategy, a vinylene-bridged COF film with a complete sp2-carbon skeleton has been successfully synthesized for the first time at room temperature. The COF nanospheres initially formed at the liquid–liquid interface slowly transmuted themselves into self-standing COF thin films with long-range ordered arrangement by covalent self-assembly. The as-fabricated electronic device with a configuration of Al/COFs/ITO exhibited a nonvolatile rewritable memory effect with a low switching-on voltage of +0.84 V. Associated with its bistable switching performance, this device is capable of executing simple \"OR\" logic operations.",

Here, we developed a MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst that can efficiently upcycle poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into valuable organic chemicals. Interestingly, the conversion mechanism is concentration-dependent. For instance, at a low ethylene glycol (EG) concentration (7.96 mM), acetate is the main product. Unexpectedly, the conversion of PET water bottle hydrolysate with only 7.96 mM ethylene glycol (EG) can produce a 4 times higher amount of acetate (704.59 nmol) than the conversion of 300 mM EG (174.50 nmol), while at a higher EG concentration (300 mM), formate is the dominant product. Herein, a 40 times higher EG concentration (300 mM compared to 7.96 mM) would produce only ∼3 times more formate (179 nmol compared to 51.86 nmol). In addition, under natural sunlight conditions, comparable amounts of liquid and gaseous products are produced when commercial PET plastics are employed. Overall, the photocatalytic PET conversion process is quite efficient under a low concentration of EG in PET hydrolysate, indicating the enormous potential of this photocatalysis strategy for real plastics upcycling.",

    "abstract": "Atomically precise copper nanoclusters have recently attracted tremendous attention, as they often exhibit structures and properties distinct to their gold and silver counterparts. Although considerable progress has been made in the preparation and structure determination of copper nanoclusters, the introduction of those newly created materials in more underlying areas such as nonlinear optics is in its infancy. Herein, we report a new class of Cu50 nanoclusters exhibiting a tunable optical limiting effect. The facile preparation prototype reported in this work allows the discovery of up to four clusters with the nearly identical metal framework, namely, Cu50(CF3COO)12(3,5-diMe-PhS)18(PPh3)4H2 (Cu50-1), Cu50(CF3COO)10(4-F-PhS)20(PPh3)6H2 (Cu50-2), Cu50(CF3COO)10(PhS)20(PPh3)6H2 (Cu50-3), and Cu50(PhCOO)10(4-F-PhS)20(PPh3)6H2 (Cu50-4). The molecular structure of the Cu50 series, as revealed by X-ray single crystal analysis, describes the stabilization of Cu44 core by an organometallic shell of thiolate-carboxylate-phosphine-copper. The combinatorial studies by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the clusters contain 18 free valence electrons, making them probably the first library of copper superatoms featuring 18e. As revealed by the nanosecond Z-scan measurements results, the clusters exhibit typical optical limiting effects, indicating their promising applications in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). More importantly, the labile surface motifs on Cu50 allow us to tune their NLO properties. This work not only reports a new class of atomically precise copper nanoclusters with facile preparation process, clear structures, and labile surface motifs but also encourages research on the exploration of copper nanoclusters in more exciting areas.",

The oxidized MoS2–ER nanoparticles significantly enhanced the hydrophilicity of the Co@NCNTs. Hydrophilicity improvement increased the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of MoS2–Co@NCNTs–ER and promoted the ion transport between the catalyst and electrolyte, which led to the enhanced OER/ORR catalytic performance compared with Co@NCNTs. Meanwhile, a PEO–PANa GPE with high electrical conductivity and excellent electrolyte absorption and retention capacity was reported. QSS-F-ZABs assembled with MoS2–Co@NCNTs and PEO–PANa GPE exhibit enhanced charge/discharge performance and long-cycle stability with a stable cycle of 200 h at a current density of 2 mA cm–2 and 160 h at a current density of 5 mA cm–2.",

However, the development of NIR-II fluorescence imaging for the study of kidney dysfunction has been impeded by a lack of renal-clearable NIR-II luminescent materials with good optical properties. This study synthesized renally clear gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) with both NIR-II excitation and emission for the first time. Imaging with NIR-II light excitation offers deep tissue penetration, high resolution, and a high signal-to-background ratio. Additionally, the developed Au NCs have quantum yields as high as 1.4–2.0%, nearly 10-fold higher than that of previous renal clearable NIR-II emitting materials. These salient merits allow Au NCs to realize high-resolution fluorescence imaging, as well as monitoring of kidney dysfunction induced by renal ischemia–reperfusion and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Our findings provide new candidate materials for NIR-II fluorescence imaging and a powerful tool for high-resolution and accurate imaging of kidney diseases.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid development of novel drug delivery systems, the limited intratumor accumulation of drugs and immunomodulatory function of drug nanovehicles still limit their therapeutic efficiency. Deeper penetration can be achieved by reducing the size of nanocarriers after reaching the tumor site. However, the persistence of such nanocarriers is limited due to their small particle size and ease of removal from tumors. Here, we design a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-responsive peptide, AGLR, that can encapsulate the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and self-assemble to form spherical nanoparticles (NPs) in a physiological environment, which enhances drug penetration in tumor tissue. Upon cleavage by MMP-2 overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment, DOX/AGLR is transformed from spherical NPs to nanofibers (NFs), improving the DOX retention time and accumulation in tumors in vivo. Furthermore, DOX/AGLR penetrates the extracellular matrix (ECM) and inhibited the upregulation of CCL2 and CD31, inhibiting tumor growth and lung metastasis. Importantly, DOX/AGLR increased the proportion of DC cells and decreased the proliferation of Treg cells. The expression of TGF-β and PD-L1 was downregulated, indicating that DOX/AGLR alleviated the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This enzyme-responsive, morphologically transformable drug-delivery strategy provides a promising general tumor therapy modality with enhanced antitumor efficacy and immunomodulation.",

However, their potential applications in high-performance optoelectronic devices are still unexplored due to limited optical properties and poor charge transfer efficiency. Here, a new class of CAS/ZnSe QDs exhibiting decent visible light absorption/emission was prepared and associative QD-gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) heterostructures were rationally constructed for improved charge separation and transport efficiency. Both experimental and theoretical studies revealed that such metal nanocluster decoration enables effective charge transfer from QDs to Au NCs. Photodetectors (PDs) fabricated using CAS/ZnSe QDs and Au-QD heterostructures were further demonstrated, wherein the Au-QDs PD show enhanced device performance with a responsivity of 7.57 A W–1 and a detectivity of 2.48 × 1011 Jones (405 nm, 2.8 mW cm–2) compared to that of the CAS/ZnSe QD PDs. We found that the Au NCs conjunction is key to setting intermediate energy levels and facilitating photoinduced charge transfer from QDs to the electron-transport layers (TiO2) employed in PD devices. Besides, as-assembled, Au-QD PDs have demonstrated optoelectronic synapse application by emulating the learning and forgetting processes under optical stimulation, representing a promising prototype device to achieve future solution-processed neuromorphic electronics.",

In this work, we examined a series of prototypical glycolated polythiophene materials (P3MEEET) with systematically increasing molecular weights within organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)─a common testbed for investigating mixed transport. We find that there is improved performance beyond an intermediate molecular weight; however, this relationship is electrolyte dependent. Operando analysis suggests that the enhanced mobility at higher molecular weights may be negated by significant swelling when operated in NaCl due to disruption of intercrystallite charge percolation. The role of molecular weight is revealed through operation in KTFSI, as doping occurs through cation expulsion, preventing detrimental swelling and maintaining percolative pathways. These findings demonstrate the importance of both molecular weight and electrolyte composition to enhance the performance of OMIECs.",

Accordingly, enthusiasm for extensive research on scintillators has been steadily growing. However, obtaining scintillators with superior performance via feasible processing and minimizing the scattering of X-ray propagation between the scintillator screen and the imaging object, especially for targets with highly curved surfaces, are still challenges. Here, an organic metal halide scintillator [Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim = 1-butyl-2,3-methylimidazolium) is developed, which reveals a fascinating thermoplastic characteristic at 363 K. It allows the as-explored scintillator to be used as an adhesive paint, addressing the light scattering of X-ray imaging fundamentally. The rheological property is demonstrated to profit from the structural characteristic of [SbCl5]2– and organic groups directly connected by hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the exceptional processability of the corresponding scintillator further confirms its recycling capability in painting/scraping onto/from the targets. Notably, X-ray imaging with a high resolution (∼12.5 lp mm–1) is constantly achievable. Herein, these results not only figure out the light scattering of X-ray imaging for curved or irregularly shaped objects but also open a new avenue to the development of low-cost X-ray detectors and imagers with feasible processability.",

Here, theoretical analysis and experiment indicate the inherent synergistic effect of dual metal sites in N-doped carbon for bifunctional ORR and OER. Specifically, introducing Ru to generate RuFe–N–C or RuCo–N–C double-atom catalysts (DACs) can significantly enhance the bifunctional ORR/OER activities of Fe(Co) and Ru sites, exceeding the equivalent single metal Fe(Co)–N–C and Ru–N–C. Investigations of a series of RuM–N–C DACs reveal that the intriguing synergistic effect results from the modified charge density and d-band center by combining two optimized metal atoms, which affects adsorption energies of intermediates and catalytic activity. Based on these theoretical guidelines, RuFe–N–C is synthesized using a bimetal MOF as the precursor, and it exhibits exceptional ORR/OER activities in alkaline media with a small ΔE of 0.63 V, significantly outperforming Fe–N–C, Ru–N–C, and even commercial Pt/C-RuO2.",

However, their commercial application is hindered by the undesirable troubles of rapid capacity fading, insulation of the products (Li2S/Li2S2), volume expansion, and low mass loading. Herein, a three-dimensional holey CNT/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (CNT@SPAN) freestanding cathode has been fabricated by a one-step phase inversion method, followed by sulfurization without any binders and current collectors. The unique porous framework design with SPAN in situ encapsulating CNT can effectively facilitate the transportation of ions and electrons, and endure the volume expansion of sulfur during the reaction process.

This work refreshes the current performance of Li-SPAN batteries with a maximum areal capacity of 10.21 mAh cm–2 at an ultrahigh mass loading of 7.5 mg cm–2, and an excellent rate capacity of 761.7 mAh g–1 at 4 C, which provides a promising method to make Li–S batteries to meet the requirements of commercial application.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable electronic properties of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials make them promising platforms for next-generation spintronic devices. In this study, we demonstrate the room-temperature graphene lateral spin valve devices in the Fe3GaTe2/graphene full vdW heterostructure. The spin transport channel is few-layer graphene, and room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 is used as both the spin injector and detector. Pronounced nonlocal spin valve signals can be observed when the magnetic field sweeps along the out-of-plane easy axis direction of Fe3GaTe2. This nonlocal spin valve signal persists even at 320 K, realizing a room-temperature lateral spin valve in full vdW heterostructure. Additionally, a significant magnitude nonlocal spin valve signal can be detected even with the low bias current of 1 μA. Furthermore, the magnetic field angle-dependent nonlocal measurements revealed that the nonlocal spin valve behavior is closely related to the robust large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy property of Fe3GaTe2. The nonlocal spin valve signal is prominent when the magnetic field is applied near the perpendicular direction and disappears under the in-plane magnetic field. These results demonstrate the potential of Fe3GaTe2 as a prospective candidate for constructing room-temperature, two-dimensional vdW spintronic devices.",

For this reason, a novel aqueous borate type bio-based polymer with inherent Li ions was designed as an SEI forming binder for graphite. The low lying LUMO energy level enabled the preferential reduction of the binder prior to the degradation of the electrolyte or salt to form a thinner and highly conducting borate rich SEI. A robust boron rich SEI and a binder with inherent Li ions improved the kinetics with low activation energy for lithiation/desolvation (22.56 kJ/mol), lower SEI resistance, and a high Li+ diffusion coefficient across the graphite galleries (7.24 × 10–9 cm2 s–1). Anodic half-cells with the novel binder delivered a discharge capacity of 73 mAh/g at 10 C, which is three times higher than the those of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose/polystyrene-polybutadiene rubber (CMC-SBR) counterparts, with a high capacity retention for more than 1000 cycles.",

The main challenge for ZIBs is the lack of robust structure to accommodate repeated ion insertion/extraction in aqueous solutions. In contrast to transition metal oxides cathodes (MnO2, V2O5), iron-based polyanionic compounds have rigid structure and open framework, hence may serve as compatible cathodes for aqueous batteries. However, only several iron-based polyanionic cathodes such as Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, have received scant attentions to date, not to mention that their underlying complex reaction mechanisms in aqueous solutions have not yet been clearly revealed. In this work, we identify the Na+/Zn2+ cointercalation mechanism of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 in zinc-ion batteries by both experimental spectra and DFT calculations. Benefiting from the synergistic chemistry, the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 demonstrates enhanced structural stability and ion diffusion kinetics upon the Na+/Zn2+ cointercalation in comparison with single metal ion (only Na+ or Zn2+) storage reaction, hence a high-power density (6.73 kW kg–1) and long cycle life (54.6% after 5000 cycles) are exhibited. In particular, the prominent reaction kinetics endows the battery with low-temperature (−30 °C) operation capability (capacity retention of 87.6%).",

    "abstract": "The development of novel photocatalytic systems for energy-saving and efficient water purification and sterilization is extremely challenging but crucial for the prevention of chronic diseases caused by water pollution and bacteria. The self-aggregation of photosensitizers (PSs) driven by tight π–π stacking leads to a sharp decline in the ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has become the main bottleneck for the application of PSs in photocatalytic water purification and sterilization. Herein, a series of porous anthracene-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) {[Zn(L)2(DEF)2]n·2nDEF·nH2O (GXNU-1), [Co2(L)4(DEF)2]n·4nDEF·8nH2O (GXNU-2), and [Ni(L)2(DEF)2]n·nDEF·4nH2O (GXNU-3)} with excellent ROS generation ability were designed and synthesized. The energy level structures of GXNU-1–3 were determined by electrochemical experiments, which proved that all the frameworks have the ability to produce 1O2. In addition, the photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) proved that the formation of MOF structures can effectively enhance the charge separation ability and promote photogenerated holes and excitons under light-driven conditions, thereby further promoting the rapid generation of ROS. Their ability to catalyze the rapid purification and sterilization of high-concentration dye wastewater under low-power (60 mW·cm–2) light irradiation was then determined. The porous framework structure prevents the tight π–π stacking of anthracene-based PSs and increases the contact sites with oxygen. Moreover, the introduction of metal ions promotes the intersystem crossing of excitons through spin–orbit coupling. These advantages greatly enhance the ROS generation ability of GXNU-1–3 in aqueous solutions. Notably, GXNU-1–3 almost completely degraded high-concentration organic dyes, such as crystal violet (CV), methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and orange II (OII). In addition, GXNU-1 efficiently degraded mixed organic dyes of CV (30 mg·L–1) and MB (10 mg·L–1) within 30 min of light irradiation, thereby showing a surprising ability to purify multicomponent dye wastewater. The heterogeneous GXNU-1–3 can be rapidly separated from the aqueous solution by centrifugation and filtration to avoid secondary pollution. More notably, GXNU-1 can effectively inhibit the rapid proliferation of Gram-negative/positive bacteria under light irradiation conditions. Masks and experimental clothes soaked in a GXNU-1 aqueous solution for 15 s clearly resisted bacterial contamination after being exposed to 60 mW·cm–2 light irradiation for 4 min. These findings open new horizons for the construction of novel photocatalytic systems that are fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly.",

The crystalline powders of DCzPy emitted blue-green fluorescence at 490 nm. Upon gently grinding, the fluorescence intensity of DCzPy was dramatically enhanced with a hypsochromic shift by 33 nm. Further heavily grinding, its emission wavelength returned to 490 nm. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that such behaviors were attributed to the solid-state morphology transition from crystal to crystal. Interestingly, a large bathochromic-shifted and weakened fluorescence was achieved under isotropic compression. Moreover, thermoresponsive behavior of DCzPy was studied in the film to find that its emission turned from green to blue as the temperature increased. Given the thermo-induced fluorescence switching of DCzPy, a two-dimensional code was fabricated for information anticounterfeiting.",

However, it is rare to develop methods to tune the intrinsic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of MOFs. Herein, it is demonstrated that heavy-atom-free CAU-10 MOFs with color-, lifetime-, and intensity-tunable intrinsic RTP can be achieved by ligand functionalization. By introducing an electron-donating substituent to isophthalic acid, the phosphorescence of CAU-10 MOFs can change from green to yellow with a lifetime ranging from 6.5 to 638 ms at ambient temperature. The strong metal–organic coordination bond and firm anchoring of ligands make the MOFs show superior RTP performance and stability compared to the crystals of pure organic ligands. Density functional theory calculations are applied to interpret the effect of ligand substituents on the luminescence of MOFs and reveal the emission difference among ligand molecules, ligand crystals, and MOFs. This work offers a new strategy to control the phosphorescence of MOFs, and emphasizes the advantages of structural tunability and stability of MOFs in the field of photoluminescence.",

D was photoirradiated to an excited singlet state, subsequently undergoing excitation energy transfer (EET) to A with high efficiency (ΦEET = 95.3%).

The purpose of this review is to provide a brief summary of current methods used to construct CANs with the help of nanotechnology and to explain how they work and their improvements over conventional CANs.

However, some critical challenges remain due to the difficulty in tuning solid–liquid phase transition behaviors of PCMs. Here we present optically-controlled tunability of solid–liquid transitions in photoswitchable PCMs (ps-PCMs) synthesized by decorating the molecular structure of long-chain alkanes with a photo-induced isomerization unit. The dual and reversible solid–liquid phase transitions have remarkable differences in melting/crystallization points, which can be optically switched. This unique characteristic of ps-PCMs enables unconventional thermal energy storage, including variable-temperature thermal storage and optically-controlled thermal upgrade. The experimental results show that the synthesized PCMs can adapt to the variable thermal charging temperatures by photo-induced switching of the phase transition behaviors and can also store heat at below 75 °C and release it at above 100 °C. Besides, the ps-PCMs possess a high gravimetric energy storage density of up to 0.36 MJ kg–1 due to the sum of phase-change enthalpy and molecular isomerization enthalpy. We believe that this work provides a new avenue for versatile PCM-based thermal energy storage and thermal management.",

Solid-state UV–vis-NIR spectroscopy on bulk crystals indicated strong absorbance in the NIR region, attributed to the radical monoanion of the pedt ligands, which was also evident in the solid-state Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrum. DFT computations on a model system provided new insights into the structural factors underpinning the photothermal properties. First, the NIR absorption corresponds to a high-energy excited state (D4), while the lowest-lying excited state (D1) is close in energy to the energies of the vibrational motions, facilitating the conversion of electronic to thermal energy. Second, close contacts between interpenetrated nets of the MOF may further enhance the propagation of thermal motion. The new photothermal MOF was then doped into a self-healing polymer, PDU (polydimethylsiloxane-urea), leading to composites which could recover from dynamic damage using the heat generated from the embedded MOF by photostimulus. This process led by the photothermal effect offers a highly efficient and energy-saving approach for self-healing materials design.",

The concentration and path length-independent chiral anisotropy factor, gCD, for this compound is the highest in the orange-red part of the visible spectrum reported so far from any hybrid material, arising from a chirality transfer from the organic component to the inorganic layer through the extensive asymmetric hydrogen bonding network and electronic coupling, driving the CuBr4 tetrahedral units to follow the 21-screw axis. This sensitivity in the orange-red part of the visible spectrum is achieved by incorporating bromine in the copper coordination sphere, which significantly red-shifts the band edge absorption to ∼710 nm compared to ∼490 nm reported for the chloride analogue. DFT/TDDFT calculations allow us to understand the underlying electronic structure responsible for its remarkable optical properties.

For this purpose, gelatin biomolecules functionalized with caffeic acid (CA) and methacryloyl groups are cross-linked using UV light to assess their cross-linking and bioadhesion. Despite the typical emphasis on wet adhesion of catecholic biomaterials, samples with larger catechol content showed lower adhesion strength, particularly when bioadhesives are cross-linked in situ as injectable sealants. Cross-linking was found to decay toward the interface with the substrates as more catechol groups are introduced to the hydrogels, which further undermines hydrogel integrity and adhesive bonds.

Specifically, moderate SMSI could efficiently optimize the structural and electronic properties of catalysts and tune the conversion of key reaction intermediates involved in CO2 hydrogenation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Nevertheless, excessive SMSI is fatal for methanation and methanol synthesis catalysts, because the encapsulation of active centers suppresses the further hydrogenation of reactive intermediates. Additionally, SMSI could alter the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity by regulating the dissociation of H2 and the breakage of C–O bonds. Subsequently, the structural dependencies of SMSI on supported catalysts are emphasized with the aim of providing guidance for developing CO2 hydrogenation catalysts with an appropriate SMSI by rational design. To conclude, highlighted perspectives on the deeper understanding of SMSI in CO2 hydrogenation catalysts are also presented.",

The performance of transdermal sensors is impacted mainly by damage or deformation of the sensing layer located on the MN surface, which usually occurs due to friction caused between the MN surface and skin tissue. In this work, we report the development of a 4 × 4 polymeric MN array (PMNA) with an individual MN height of ∼720 μm and integrated conductive recessed microcavities (MC) on the MNs surface to protect the sensing layer during insertion and removal from the skin. Characterization and proof-of-concept experiments on porcine skin reveal that PMNA/MC-based platforms retain their functionality and sensitivity of 2.36 ± 0.06 nA mM–1 even after multiple skin applications. Three-dimensional nanostructuring of MNA hence provides alternative solutions to the critical issues of maintaining performance upon insertion into skin. This approach holds great potential in advancing transdermal sensing technology and affording reliable, cost-effective, and clinically adequate sensing devices.",

The strong chelating coordination ability of the hydroxyl and sulfonate O atoms from H4DOBSC endows the framework of FIR-138 with good stability, while the formation of the Ti-phenolic motif ensures excellent visible light absorption with a bandgap (Eg) of 1.74 eV.

In this study, we fabricated Pt/TiN/HfO2/WS2/Pt memristive devices. To implement these devices, a WS2 film was thermally evaporated under high vacuum conditions followed by HfO2 growth using atomic layer deposition at 400 °C. Detailed analysis using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed diffusion of W and S atoms within the HfO2 layer and extraction of oxygen by W atoms, thus resulting in a multilayer structure (HfWOySx, Wx–1OySx, and W1–xOySx) with varying ratios of oxygen, tungsten, and sulfur atoms (x and y). The fabricated devices demonstrated consistent and stable analogue switching over numerous cycles, with exceptional endurance (2000 cycles) and retention (103 s). They exhibited high cycle-to-cycle consistency, as evidenced by the low-coefficient of variation (3.5% and 4.0% for the set and reset voltages, respectively). By modulating the reset stop voltage, we achieved five-level resistance states, thus making these devices capable of being used in artificial synapses. Furthermore, we observed analog switching with gradual resistance changes under different current compliance conditions by incrementally adjusting the reset–stop voltage. The memristor-based artificial synapses exhibited fundamental synaptic functions, such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression, paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity for long-term and short-term plasticity. Moreover, we employed a three-layer artificial neural network for image recognition, achieving 94% accuracy using identical pulse amplitudes. These findings highlight the potential of HfO2/WS2 bilayer films, enable controllable analogue switching, and simulate synaptic functions. They hold promise for future data storage memory and neuromorphic computing systems.",

So far, azobenzene has been the most widely studied molecule for these applications. However, until now, only solid and liquid derivatives of azobenzene have been explored which suffer from several limitations. Here, we are reporting for the first time visible-light responsive STFs based on liquid crystals (LCs). We have prepared a series of compounds based on azobenzene and cholesterol with varying spacer and ortho-substitution on azobenzene. All of these derivatives exhibit enantiotropic chiral nematic (N*) mesophases. Moreover, they showed excellent photostability, photocyclability, and long half-life times of cis-states. We have further evaluated the thin films of these compounds for charging, i.e., trans to cis conversion under solar irradiation using various bandpass filters, and also studied the kinetics of the conversion. These compounds exhibited a maximum charging of up to 70% for the derivative with ortho-fluoro azobenzene. The charged thin films were further evaluated for their heat release properties by infrared (IR) thermal imaging. The maximum heat release observed was around 5.4 °C from the surrounding temperature which was significantly higher as compared to similarly substituted azobenzene-based derivative without a LC phase.",

    "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted great attention as pivotal photocatalysts for efficient CO2 photoreduction into value-added fuels, which hold great promise for simultaneously mitigating global warming and the energy crisis. However, the synthesis of COFs with a high crystalline state and hierarchically porous structure to boost CO2 photoreduction is still an enormous challenge and rarely reported, probably because of the great dependence upon monomers and rigorous preparation conditions. Herein, a series of functional kagome (kg m) topologic 2D COFs with high crystallinity and porosity were synthesized based on the condensation of 4,4′,4″,4‴-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetraaniline (ETTA) and 2,2′-bipyridyl-5,5′-dialdehyde (Bpy-CHO) building units combined with a postmodification strategy, named ETTA-Bpy-COF-M (M = H, Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu). Stimulated by the unique kg m topologized framework with well-ordered hierarchical micropores and mesopores, abundant exposed atomic Co sites, and remarkable photoelectrical performance, ETTA-Bpy-COF-Co is used as a photocatalyst for catalyzing the CO2-to-CO photoconversion and exhibits a high CO yield rate (9398.14 μmol g–1 h–1), a large CO selectivity (92.73%), and good durability. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrated that the superior performance for CO2 photoreduction catalyzed by ETTA-Bpy-COF-Co was attributed to the desirable cooperative contribution of kg m topological structure with hexagonal and triangular pores as well as atomic Co active sites, which can promote the photoexcited charge carrier kinetics, enhance the CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as reduce the energy barriers of *COOH generation and CO desorption. This work opens a new way to enhance COF photosynthesis for CO2 reduction and offers precious insights into related studies in the future.",

Moreover, the performance of directly regenerated materials is inferior to that of commercial materials. It hinders the development of recycled cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Herein, spent LiFePO4 with severely degraded is regenerated by preoxidation and prilling combine cocoating strategy. The preoxidation fully decomposed the binder and residual carbon. The subsequent regeneration process synthesized spherical LiFePO4 with carbon and Li3PO4 cocoating layer, whose electrochemical performance is comparable to commercial LiFePO4. This method dramatically improves the rate and low temperature electrochemical performance of the regenerated LiFePO4, which provides a new scheme for the reuse of recycled LFP in lithium-ion batteries.",

This study presents a novel method utilizing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of anesthetic drugs. Employing methanol enhances the substrate's resistance to biomolecular interference, improving drug solubility. The resulting uniformly mixed microextraction system promotes specific drug recognition by silver nanoparticles, amplifying the characteristic Raman signals. This technique was used to obtain Raman fingerprint profiles of 10 anesthetic drugs and to accurately identify each drug molecule using the dimensionality reduction technique. The detection limit of fentanyl among opioids was 50 ng mL–1, while the detection thresholds of tramadol and dizocin were both 50 pg mL–1, which proved the method's high sensitivity. Application of the technique to clinical blood samples from eight patients and a healthy volunteer shows consistent results comparable to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Notably, the SERS approach identifies individual drug peaks, even in the presence of multiple agents. Moreover, the adaptability of SERS allows for real-time monitoring, offering opportunities for personalized anesthetic management based on patient-specific requirements. These findings highlight the potential of this assay for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in anesthesia, promising improved patient care, and optimized drug dosing strategies.",

Here, we synthesize and characterize a series of new 0D isomeric copper iodides, namely, Cu4I4(3-trifluoromethylpyridine)4. The emission center [Cu4I4] cubane coordinates with a sterically hindered 3-trifluoromethylpyridine ligand to form four 0D isolated copper iodide clusters, which show ligand-configuration-dependent photoluminescence. The four polymorphs emit blue, green, yellow, and pure white-light, respectively, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in the range of 80–95%. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of all compounds show long averaged decay lifetime up to 10 μs. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electronic structures and the emission characteristics at excited states, illustrating the structure–emission relations. Our results demonstrate that the ligand configurations and orientations have strong impact on the distortion of [Cu4I4] cubane at the excited state, leading to different energy transitions and emission colors. This work provides a new design strategy for multicolor luminescent phosphors and presents the first example of pure white-light emission in a copper(I) iodide system with a near-unity PLQY.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis-based therapy exhibits promising prospects for the treatment of malignant tumors. However, the practical therapeutic benefits of ferroptosis-based antitumor therapy are usually restricted by excess endogenous antioxidants and relatively sluggish ROS production kinetics. Here, an activatable plasmonic versatile nanoplatform (AuSi@FePB) with glutathione (GSH)-depletion capacity is reported for synergistic ferroptosis therapy and second near-infrared window photothermal therapy (NIR-II PTT). The nanoplatform exhibits stability in physiological conditions, but in the tumor microenvironment, its Fe-PDA shell gradually disintegrates to increase intracellular ferrous supply for elevated ROS generation and GSH-depletion in response to overexpressed GSH, leading to amplified ferroptosis of tumor cells. The integration of NIR-II laser irradiation facilitates the generation of localized heat, which not only effectively triggers photothermal therapy but also significantly enhances the Fenton reaction, thereby promoting ferroptotic cell death in tumor cells. While the oxidative damage can also downregulate the heat repair effect, thereby facilitating the PTT efficacy. More importantly, such synergism not only results in the elimination of the primary tumor but also triggers a systemic antitumor immune response, facilitating the regression of nontreated distant tumors and impeding the occurrence of lung metastasis. The in vivo therapeutic mechanism was further verified by transcriptome sequencing, demonstrating that synergistic GSH-depletion augmented ferroptosis therapy and NIR-II PTT are an effective combination antitumor strategy. This study presents a promising perspective for cancer treatment based on ferroptosis and also sheds new light on novel therapeutic platforms for future cancer therapy.",

The AQ moiety with good electron-withdrawing ability and significant spin–orbit coupling effect could facilitate the generation of triplet excitons by triggering multichannel intersystem crossing.

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy faces critical challenges in clinical oncology treatment. One primary reason is the tumor hypoxia that obstructs the penetration of chemotherapeutic drugs into solid tumors and diminishes drug concentration in tumor cells, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Thereupon, we create a self-immolative phototherapeutic prodrug (DHQ-AZO-BIO) featured with tumor targeting and hypoxia activation. First, the prodrug is a heavy-atom-free photosensitizer based on intramolecular noncovalent interactions (NCIs), which specifically enriches into tumors and produces photocytotoxic 1O2 to eliminate normoxic tumor cells on the tumor surface layer by photodynamic therapy (PDT). Second, the PDT process also increases the hypoxic degree within the solid tumor, thereby improving the on-demand release and action efficiency of the hypoxia-sensitive prodrug. This combined treatment fashion synergizes hypoxia-activated chemotherapy with PDT to overcome the limitation of tumor hypoxia and augment the therapeutic index for tumors, contributing to the development of drug delivery systems (DDSs) and precise phototherapy for tumors.",

Herein, dense Cu@Cu6Sn5 core–shell nanoparticles are constructed on graphite felt (Cu@Cu6Sn5/GF) to induce zinc plating and inhibit the HER simultaneously. The charge transfer within the Cu6Sn5 alloy shell provides a negative charge to Cu, increasing its ability to attract Zn. The lack of electrons in Sn makes it difficult to undergo HER, which is confirmed by the total internal reflection imaging method. Meanwhile, the Cu core can increase the conductivity between the interface of the GF and Cu@Cu6Sn5. As a result, the Cu@Cu6Sn5/GF electrode demonstrates superior cycling performance in AZIFB with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.3% in 700 cycles and achieves a maximum power density of 487.6 mW cm–2.

The results demonstrate that the phenolic hydroxyl groups in tyramine improve the chemical affinity among ammonium polyphosphate, vinyl ester resin, and carbon fibers due to the great adhesion, while also exhibiting excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial fouling properties for bacteria, mold, and algae.

Enzyme-activated fluorescent probes have been demonstrated as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of DILI; however, they suffer from diffusive signal dilution and interference with other organs, thus leading to misassessment of drug toxicity and inaccurate diagnosis. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an important biomarker, and alterations in the enzyme level are tightly correlated to the severity of liver damage. Herein, an enzyme-activated intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) enhanced probe (TPEG-P) was developed for ALP detection in cells and mice models of DILI. Differing from previously reported intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) or the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) mechanisms, the TPEG-P enables precise recognition and imaging of ALP only through the activation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and could in situ sensitively detect varying degrees of liver injury caused by drug toxicity. This IMHB strategy will advance the development of enzyme-activated probes and precise bioimaging in the future.",

Furthermore, we successfully fabricate high-efficiency quasi-2D perovskite light-emitting diodes with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 21.73% and a current efficiency of 70.30 cd A–1.",

Metallo-organic compounds with unique chemical structures and optical and electronic properties are an important type of organic semiconducting material for logic gate circuits. On the one hand, the excellent optoelectronic response characteristic of metallo-organic compounds allows them to achieve elementary logic functions. On the other hand, the structural diversity and adjustability of metallo-organic compounds could be utilized for simulating versatile high-speed, low-power logic operations by different types of stimuli. Up to now, various metallo-organic compounds such as metal complexes, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, and MOFs materials have been explored and applied in logic gate circuits with attractive application potentials in fields of wearable electronics, sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI), etc. In this review, we first introduce the basic concepts and classification of logic gate circuits and then focus on analyzing the application principles and advantages of metallo-organic compounds including metal complexes, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, and MOFs materials in logic gate circuits. Finally, we outline recent specific application cases of the above materials in logic gate circuits, demonstrating their potential in the design of high-performance logic gate circuits, and summarize their challenges and future development trends.

Herein, we constructed a novel multifunctional nanoplatform based on bismuth-doped iron selenide nanoparticles (BFS NPs) for promoting the therapeutic performance of CDT on CRC. BFS NPs can realize CDT and second near-infrared photothermal therapy (NIR-II PTT) by means of the Fenton reaction and an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 31.9%). Moreover, the rising temperature induced by NIR irradiation accelerates the Fenton reaction rate because of there being more activated H2O2, thereby improving reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to address the insufficient hydrogen peroxide concentration. The results showed that the combination of CDT with NIR-II PTT significantly inhibits the growth of CRC and minimizes adverse reactions. Meanwhile, bismuth doping endows the BFS NPs with superior CT imaging and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2-MRI) capacities. These unique properties offer an appropriate treatment time window for guiding NIR-II PTT. In summary, this nanoplatform improves the therapeutic effect of CDT and accurately regulates NIR-II PTT by MRI/CT imaging guidance, which provides a new perspective for effective and precise therapy of CRC.",

The spectral red-shift from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of isolated nanocrystals to that of an assembly reflects coupling strength, which depends on nanocrystal characteristics and assembly structure. Scaling laws that relate these shifts to nanocrystal spacing are useful to systematically describe plasmon coupling and predict peak shifts for materials design. Here, we develop a unified scaling relationship that accounts for unique properties of metal-oxide plasmonic nanocrystals by considering the dopant influence on the LSPR frequency and free electron distribution within nanocrystals. We propose a rescaled plasmon ruler, adjusted for the presence of a dopant-dependent depletion layer, to describe the spectral shifts of colloidal indium tin oxide nanocrystals assembled into close-packed superlattices.

The maximum power density of the 7.5%-iHOF-13/Nafion composite membrane can reach 104.7 mW cm–2 in DMFCs, which is 2.1 times higher than that of recast Nafion. The incorporation of high-performance iHOF facilitates the enhancement of the proton transport pathway while effectively inhibiting methanol crossover, thus expanding its potential application in fuel cells.",

The [N-X+-N] halogen bonds are a powerful tool for constructing supramolecular aggregates, including halogen-bonded organic frameworks (XOFs), which have emerged as a new class of organic frameworks. However, the existing production of XOFs often yields insoluble AgI byproducts, impeding XOF crystallinity, performance, and functionality. Hence, alternative methods for XOF preparation are required. Here, we present a novel approach to constructing 2D XOFs via reversible ligand exchange reactions, avoiding unwanted AgI byproducts and enhancing crystallinity. Notably, this approach successfully yields highly crystalline XOF-TPTE, which was unattainable with the previous method. XOF-TPTE exhibits exceptional catalytic activity and recyclability upon Pd(II) loading, showing remarkable selective performance in Heck coupling reactions and indicating its potential for diverse applications. This method broadens XOF construction horizons and expands their preparation and applications.",

Our study introduces a series of dioxythiophene-based copolymers, where we adjust backbone planarity, electron-richness, and side chain polarity to investigate their effects on spectral traits. We find a clear correlation between higher conductivity and larger optical modulations attained through a broadening of the charge carrier bands and an intensification of specific vibrational modes. As thin films, our top-performing copolymer attains an 85% IR-contrast between its doped and undoped states. To probe their performance under electrochemical control, we fabricated and tested electrochromic cells with the best cells reaching a mid-IR contrast of nearly 60%. These findings enhance our understanding of design rules impacting mid-IR spectral features for conjugated polymers.",

By shielding in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), the water-dispersed radical nanoparticles (ZIF-Radical NPs) achieve a 1770-fold improvement in radical stability compared with free TCNQ radical species in water. Moreover, ZIF-Radical NPs show good tolerance for harsh conditions. Upon 808 nm light irradiation, the ZIF-Radical NPs exhibit good photothermal conversion performances with a high stability. Nearly 100% killing efficiency toward both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus was also achieved by efficient photothermal antibacterial activity of ZIF-Radical NPs.

Under the tumor microenvironment, the nanodrug could synchronously release DOX and Fe, and then induce •OH generation and intracellular GSH depletion efficiently, showing a multimodality synergistic therapeutic effect in vitro and in vivo.

In this work, flexible electronic synapses based on carbon quantum dots (CQDs) synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation are exploited. The CQDs-based devices exhibit similar and stable current–voltage (I–V) characteristics to the initial state after undergoing multiple bending, including I–V curves, retention characteristic for 100 h, endurance characteristic for 106 bending cycles, and classical synaptic functions can be performed faster than the human brain. This is attributed to the extremely small number of defects on the surface of CQDs synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation, which ensures the density and uniformity of the carbon-based film. Interestingly, the artificial neural network model based on the Crosimm platform is used to iteratively train and recognize Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwriting, and the simulation results are between 94.2% and 94.9%, further verifying the reliability of silver (Ag)/CQDs/indium tin oxide (ITO)-based devices. Therefore, a reliable decimal arithmetic based on synaptic weight changes is proposed, and addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division can all be performed by applying high-speed pulses.

Generally, the molecular conformation is of great importance but is often overlooked, regardless of its importance for molecular packing in aggregated states and the corresponding performance. In this work, the relationship between the electronic effect of substituents and the thermodynamically stable conformation in phenothiazine derivatives is explored for the first time. When the substituent is phenyl or a 3-position pyridyl group, the quasi-equatorial (QE) conformer is the main thermo-stable conformation. At this time, the lone pair electrons of the 10-position nitrogen are stabilized by the polyheterocyclic phenothiazine core, resulting in the formation of a large p-π-conjugated electron system. When the substituents are a 2-pyridine or 4-pyridine group, the corresponding lone pair electrons are more easily stabilized by the electron-deficient pyridine system, and another thermo-stable p-π conjugated conformation, namely the quasi-axial (QA) conformer, is formed. In addition, the effects of the two conformations on the corresponding photophysical properties are investigated in detail. It was found that the emissive properties in both singlet and triplet states are largely affected by the molecular conformation. Excitedly, based on the adjustable conformation, one molecule containing two conformations is combined with 3D printing and successfully applied to advanced anticounterfeiting with time-resolved phosphorescence color changes.",

This article introduces a DNA targeted biologically active photosensitizer, CQA, which integrates the DNA alkylating moiety chlormethine with a photosensitizing moiety. Through DNA damage experiments and molecular docking, CQA has been demonstrated to act as an effective DNA targeting and damaging chemotherapeutic agent via chlormethine. Meanwhile, CQA can substantially amplify the DNA damage under light irradiation. Such enhancement is attributed to the introduction of the anthraquinone group, which possesses good redox properties and acts as an electron acceptor to promote electron transfer. Consequently, CQA efficiently generates both type-I and type-II reactive oxygen species (ROS), exerting an excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. The antitumor efficacy of CQA has been validated via results from in vivo tumor growth experiments, H&E staining, and IHC analyses. The design of this study emphasizes targeted DNA damage and enhanced ROS generation, underscoring the crucial role of efficient synergistic chemo- and photodynamic therapy in advancing cancer treatment strategies.",

Herein, nonaromatic chiral lysine amphiphiles with long alkyl chains connected via urea or amide bonds are designed, and their self-assembly as well as chiroptical properties are investigated. The C18 derivative with a urea bond self-assembles into a nanotube and shows an excitation-dependent (ExD) circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP).

    "abstract": "CoFe-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are emerging as prominent candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their tunable 3d orbital electronic structure but are still restricted by the strong adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates due to their high antibonding orbital relative to the Fermi level. Herein, we synthesized Ga-doped CoFe LDH (GaCoFe LDH) as a highly effective catalyst for alkaline OER. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the strong p–d orbital hybridization between Ga and Co/Fe atoms plays a critical role in boosting the OER performance. This hybridization not only effectively reduces the antibonding orbital energy levels due to an enhanced electronic filling degree in the antibonding orbital but also facilitates the dehydrogenation of *OH to *O, thereby boosting catalytic activity. Remarkably, GaCoFe LDH exhibits excellent OER performance, surpassing both CoFe LDH and RuO2/NF, with low overpotentials of 185 and 242 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively, while maintaining exceptional OER stability.",

    "abstract": "Interface engineering has been widely explored due to its potential for regulating the intermediate adsorption, controlling mass/electron transfer, and preventing severe aggregation of catalysts. Hence, we have synthesized a series of Cu–In metallic aerogels (MAs) with a controlled ratio of Cu/Cu2In interfaces as efficient catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). As a result, Cu–In MAs with the highest Cu/Cu2In interfaces abundance (Cu2In MAs) achieve the high Faradaic efficiency of CO up to 94.5% at −0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), outperforming Cu1In MAs, Cu3In MAs, Cu4In MAs, and Cu MAs. Furthermore, Cu2In MAs with the highest Cu/Cu2In interface abundance also exhibit excellent stability after continuous electrolysis for 10 h. Mechanism research indicates that the rich Cu/Cu2In interfaces in Cu2In MAs allow for moderate adsorption of CO2 and accelerate electronic transmission, which greatly reduce the energy barrier of the potential-limiting step, thus improving the CO2RR performance. This study indicates that interface engineering plays an important role in improving the CO2RR performance, providing a new strategy for preparing efficient CO2RR catalysts.",

Although promising for many applications in material science, vitrimers tend to be difficult to process because of high viscosity. Processability is commonly enhanced at the expense of mechanical performance at service temperature, and thus this trade-off remains an important challenge in the development of these materials. Herein, we report a new approach based on thermoreversible organic nanofillers (TRONs), which we define as low molar mass molecules that act as reinforcing fillers at the service temperature and plasticizers at the processing temperature. This concept is exemplified in the context of an elastomeric dioxaborolane-based polybutadiene vitrimer as a model matrix, and two different dibenzylidene sorbitol derivatives are evaluated as TRONs. We find that vitrimers loaded with TRONs exhibit improved creep resistance and tensile properties at service temperatures while also exhibiting lower viscosity at processing temperatures.",

However, ISC is a spin-forbidden process with a low triplet state generation yield (<100%). Herein, as a proof of concept, we report a new strategy of aggregation induced singlet fission (SF) process with an ultrafast rate (<100 ps) and a very high triplet yield (>100%) to design efficient PSs. Such a unique SF strategy is demonstrated with an anthracene derivative of BPA-An, which shows J-aggregation enhanced ROS generation ability. Mechanism studies with aggregation behavior and fs-transient absorption spectroscopy indicate that BPA-An in J-aggregate state can efficiently generate triplet state via the SF process with a 158% triplet yield and thus possesses excellent Type-I and Type-II ROS generation ability in nanoparticle (NP) format. Both cellular and animal experiments further prove the excellent PDT antitumor performance of BPA-An NPs. To the best of our knowledge, this work shall represent the first example of utilizing SF as the design rule to promote the triplet state generation of PSs, which shall pave a new avenue in PDT.",

    "abstract": "Vinylene-linked covalent–oganic frameworks (COFs), as novel photocatalysts, have garnered considerable attention due to their exceptional stability, remarkable π-electron delocalization, and precisely customizable structures. However, the design of novel monomers for constructing vinylene-linked COFs with tunable electronic structures is still in its early stages and poses a number of challenges. Addressing this, a tritopic monomer was developed by attaching a 3-fold 2-methylpyridine unit to the triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine core. The tritopic monomer was further condensed with tritopic aromatic dialdehydes via a solid-state Knoevenagel polycondensation reaction to form two vinylene-linked 2D COFs (TP-PB and TP-PT COF), which exhibited excellent crystallinity, preeminent stability, and outstanding π-electron delocalization. More importantly, by modulation of the donor–acceptor (D–A) interaction within the COFs, the semiconducting properties of the two COFs could be optimized. Due to the stronger D–A interactions in the TP-PB COF containing 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene unit than the TP-PT COF containing triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine unit, the TP-PB COF exhibited broader visible light absorption, narrower band gap, stronger photocurrent response, and lower charge transfer resistance, which makes the TP-PB COF a more efficient photocatalyst for the photocatalytic selective conversions of organic sulfides to sulfoxides and C-3 thiocyanation of indole derivatives with high catalytic activity and recyclability. This work not only demonstrates the construction of vinylene-linked via 2-methylpyridine Knoevenagel polycondensation but also presents a facile strategy for regulating the semiconducting properties of such COFs by fine-tuning the donor–acceptor (D–A) interactions within the COF matrices.",

TiO2 has showcased remarkable catalytic efficiency in the field of HER but it still encounters obstacles in accomplishing proficient overall water splitting. Within this work, following a sequential screening based on element type, stability, electronic structure, and adsorption energy, we designed a TiO2-based catalyst screening workflow for solar-driven overall water splitting. This DFT-based workflow significantly reduced both the time and trial-and-error costs associated with a traditional experimental design. It precisely guided the synthesis of highly dispersed Cu-loaded/N-doped TiO2, which facilitated sacrificial-agent-free solar-driven overall water splitting, resulting in a solar to fuel efficiency of 0.2% and an H2 yield of 1027.7 μmol/h/g. Advanced DFT calculations revealed that the d–p orbital coupling between Cu and N broke the scaling relationship of the O-based intermediates. This work holds promise for extension to other catalytic reactions, offering valuable insights into catalyst design endeavors.",

Here, we report a specifically designed adsorbent, named MFU-Cu(I), which is prepared by incorporating coordinatively unsaturated monovalent Cu species into an azolate-based MOF. MFU-Cu(I) integrates excellent thermal stability, high porosity, and potent chemical adsorption sites, demonstrating superior I2 capture performance under stringent conditions. At a low I2 concentration of 150 ppmv, MFU-Cu(I) achieves high I2 uptake capacities at both room temperature (3.11 g g–1) and 150 °C (0.2 g g–1), making it the most effective I2 adsorbent to date. The ability of MFU-Cu(I) to capture I2 at low concentrations and elevated temperatures is attributed to the Cu(I) sites firmly anchored within the MOF framework. These sites facilitate dissociative adsorption of I2 through a redox reaction, while inhibiting the irreversible formation of CuI precipitates. Consequently, MFU-Cu(I) can be readily regenerated after I2 adsorption via ion exchange followed by vacuum heating. The regenerability of MFU-Cu(I) represents a notable advantage over other chemical adsorbents developed for I2 capture.",

Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), derived by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, emerges as an alternative method to reduce power consumption. Recent studies on HWEs have focused on reporting cell potential reductions, but their impact on hydrogen production costs is still unclear. In this paper, power consumption and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) were evaluated to understand the economic impact of HWEs. Among various HWEs, HzOR showed an excellent energy consumption reduction (43.3 kWh/kg) resulting in the lowest LCOH ($1.92 kg–1). These results prove one of the most effective alternatives to water electrolysis in its current state. Although other HWEs show only small reductions in energy consumption and LCOH in their current state, these reactions still show high potential to reduce energy consumption and LCOH.",

    "abstract": "We report a water induced phase transformation in a flexible MOF, [Zn3(OH)2(btca)2] (Hbtca = 1H-benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid), that exhibits a two-step water vapor sorption isotherm associated with water-induced phase transformations. Variable temperature X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the dehydrated phase, LP-β, is almost isostructural with the previously reported solvated phase, LP-α. LP-β reversibly transformed to a partially hydrated phase, NP, at 5% RH, and a fully hydrated phase, LP-γ, at 47% RH. Structural studies reveal that host–guest and guest–guest interactions are involved in the NP, LP-α, and LP-γ phases. The LP-β phase, however, is atypical; molecular modeling studies indicating that it is indeed energetically favorable as a LP structure. To our knowledge, [Zn3(OH)2(btca)2] is only the second sorbent that exhibits water induced LP-NP-LP transformations (after MIL-53) and represents the first regeneration optimized sorbent (ROS) with two steps at RH ranges relevant for both atmospheric water harvesting and dehumidification.",

    "abstract": "Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), an emergent technique to study excited state optical activity, is recently finding vast applications in diverse fields. The research focus has been to develop facile strategies to overcome the low luminescence dissymmetry exhibited by molecules and materials. We herein demonstrate a host–guest approach to achieve intense chiral luminescence in a series of achiral porphyrin nanostructures through their self-assembly with a chiral gelator. Efforts focused toward formulating a structure–property correlation revealed that modulating the host–guest interactions is critical to the generation as well as tuning of the CPL activity. Luminescence dissymmetry as high as 0.015 could be achieved through a judicious design strategy. The applicability of the as synthesized nanohybrid as a potential chiral light emitting device is demonstrated by coating the nanocomposite onto an LED surface.",

    "abstract": "Electrocatalytic water splitting is pivotal for advancing the hydrogen economy, yet conventional stable-phase catalysts are constrained by rigid crystal structures and electronic states, leading to fixed active sites, limited adaptability, and sluggish kinetics. Metastable materials emerge as promising alternatives due to their structural flexibility and tunable electronic properties; however, their dynamic regulatory mechanisms remain underexplored. This review uniquely offers a comprehensive analysis of metastable catalysts, emphasizing how factors such as size, phase structure, electronic properties, defects, and interfaces significantly enhance catalytic performance. By dissecting a range of materials (metals, alloys, oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and hydroxides), we elucidate precise modulation strategies that improve efficiency and stability. Practical applications highlight their superior adaptability and activity compared to traditional catalysts. Addressing key challenges and technical bottlenecks, this review provides innovative insights and strategic directions for optimizing metastable materials, thereby advancing efficient water splitting and sustainable energy conversion technologies.",

This study explores hydrogels made from squid pen protein (SPP) and chitosan, biodegradable polymers, for anionic dye adsorption-reactive blue 4 (RB4) and methyl orange (MO). A 50%/50% SPP/chitosan hydrogel was optimal for RB4 adsorption while minimizing chitosan use. Adsorption followed the Langmuir model, with capacities of 151.52 mg/g for RB4 and 54.94 mg/g for MO. Optimal RB4 adsorption conditions were 65 °C, 6 h, pH 7, and 0.2 wt % adsorbent at 300 rpm. Kinetic analysis indicated a pseudo-second-order model, suggesting chemisorption. Characterization (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy - FT-IR, Scanning Electron Microscopy - SEM, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy - XPS) revealed functional groups and binding mechanisms, with XPS confirming a nucleophilic attack from the between amino groups of chitosan/SPP protein and the dichlorotriazine moiety of RB4. Higher cross-linker content reduced adsorption. This study demonstrates SPP/chitosan hydrogels as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative for wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "Silicon is a promising anode material for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries (ASSLIBs), due to its high capacity; however, it suffers from considerable volume expansion (>300%) during cycling, resulting in poor capacity retention, low areal capacities, and low rate capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a μSi/SWCNT/LPSCl composite that effectively coats micrometer-sized Si (μSi) particles with Li6PS5Cl and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This composite improved electrical and ionic conductivities, suppressed interface decomposition between μSi and the Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte during cycling, and mitigated volume expansion to prevent cracks and contact loss. The μSi/SWCNT/LPSCl anode shows a high initial capacity (2974 mAh g–1 at a 0.1 C rate) and stable retention for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a full cell with this anode and a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode exhibited excellent reversibility and stable cycling performance. We anticipate this study will provide a solution for high-performance Si-based anodes in ASSLIBs.",

    "abstract": "The electrochemical performance of energy storage devices decreasing with the increase of charging/discharging rates is described as the Peukert's effect. To minimize this effect, the reduction of the Peukert's constant towards the ideal value of 1.0 is needed. Herein, for the first time, we reveal a correlation between the Peukert's constant and the phase composition of electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). As a proof-of-concept, a parabola-like correlation is observed in the anatase/TiO2(B) electrode with a significant reduction in the Peukert's constant from 2.15 to 1.20, when the content of anatase phase increases from 0% to 22%. This corresponds to a capacity enhancement of about three times from 42.2 to 131.5 mAh g–1 at a current density of 12.0 A g–1. The boosted charge-transfer kinetics in the composite electrode, relative to that of the single component electrode, is the cause for the reduction in the Peukert's constant. Theoretical calculations well support the cooperative effect of maximizing both electronic conductivity and Li-ion diffusivity in the composite electrode. Our present findings provide a new way for reducing the Peukert's constant in LIBs via manipulating the materials composition, which constitutes a generalized solution towards the improved rate-performance in electrochemical reactions.",

O3-type-layered oxide cathodes are regarded as promising candidates for sodium-ion batteries because of the facile synthesis procedure and high energy density. Unfortunately, the practical use of O3-type cathodes is still hindered by their low chemical stability against water/moisture. Here we report that incorporating LiF into the crystal structure of the O3-layered oxide cathodes could significantly improve their chemical stability against water. As revealed by neutron powder diffraction, nanobeam diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, the incorporation of Li+ ions in the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer notably inhibits the Na+/H3O+ exchange process and the strong oxyfluoride bonding stabilizes the crystal structure and inhibits the O loss, further suppressing the phase transitions from O3 to hydrated-O3, hydrated-P2, and rock salt phases and the formation of surface insulating layers. As a result, the LiF-doped sample shows improved electrochemical performance after being exposed to water, in terms of higher capacity retention, faster reaction kinetics, and lower interfacial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of hydroxide ion conductivity is paramount to understanding anion exchange membranes (AEM) operated under alkaline conditions, but the measurement is complicated by dissolved CO2 and the presence of bicarbonates and carbonates. A technique for accurate measurement has recently been reported that involves measuring the conductivity during water splitting, wherein hydroxide ions are assumed, but not proven, to be produced at the cathode and which purge out other anions. In this preliminary study, we visualize the formation of hydroxide ions and their diffusion from the cathode to anode. We do this by way of an anion exchange membrane cast with an acid/base pH indicator, such that visual confirmation of hydroxide production at the cathode is obtained during application of sustained current load. This proof of concept is demonstrated using the AEM, hexamethyl-p-terphenyl poly(methylbenzamidazolium), and pH indicator, thymolphthalein, included at 0.1 and 0.2 wt % concentration. An additional novelty of this work is that we perform conductivity measurements under potentiostatic load rather than galvanostatic load, which we find substantially increases (6× faster) the time required for the membrane to reach a steady state membrane conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Porous carbons are an important class of porous material for carbon capture. The textural properties of porous carbons greatly influence their CO2 adsorption capacities. But it is still unclear what features are most conductive to achieving high CO2/N2 selectivity. Here, we trained deep neural networks from the experimental data of CO2 and N2 uptakes in porous carbons based on textural features of micropore volume, mesopore volume, and BET surface area. We then used the model to screen porous carbons and to predict CO2 and N2 uptakes, as well as CO2/N2 selectivity. We found that the highest CO2/N2 selectivity can be achieved not at the regions of highest CO2 uptake but at the regions of lowest N2 uptake where mesopores disrupt N2 adsorption. This insight will help guide experiments to synthesize better porous carbons for post-combustion CO2 capture.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric aqueous organic redox flow batteries (RFBs) are potentially a cheap, durable and safe energy storage technology. Unlike normal asymmetric flow batteries, they are based on electrolytes that exist in at least three oxidation states and can undergo a minimum of two distinct redox processes. We compute the redox potentials of selected electrolytes intending to understand how the interaction between the redox units affects the potentials. We find that electronic interaction between redox units and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can both be exploited to tune the difference between the redox potentials, i.e. the theoretical voltage of the battery. The redox potentials can be further fine-tuned in either direction by adding substituents. Starting from these observations we formulate a set of rules which will help finding ideal candidates for symmetric RFBs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and tuning the ligand shell composition in colloidal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) has been done systematically only for Pb-based perovskites, while much less is known on the surface of Pb-free perovskite systems. Here, we reveal the ligand shell architecture of Bi-doped Cs2Ag1–xNaxInCl6NCs via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. This material, in its bulk form, was found to have a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 86%, a record value for halide double perovskites. Our results show that both amines and carboxylic acids are present and homogeneously distributed over the surface of the NCs. Notably, even for an optimized surface ligand coating, achieved by combining dodecanoic acid and decylamine, a maximum PLQY value of only 37% is reached, with no further improvements observed when exploiting post-synthesis ligand exchange procedures (involving Cs-oleate, different ammonium halides, thiocyanates and sulfonic acids). Our density functional theory calculations indicate that, even with the best ligands combination, a small fraction of unpassivated surface sites, namely undercoordinated Cl ions, is sufficient to create deep trap states, opposite to the case of Pb-based perovskites that exhibit much higher defect tolerance. This was corroborated by our transient absorption measurements, which showed that an ultrafast trapping of holes (most likely mediated by surface Cl-trap states) competes with their localization at the AgCl6 octahedra, from where, instead, they can undergo an optically active recombination yielding the observed PL emission. Our results highlight that alternative surface passivation strategies should be devised to further optimize the PLQY of double perovskite NCs, which might include their incorporation inside inorganic shells.",

Here, we report a facile yet effective anticounterfeiting strategy by utilizing pattern memory surface with NIR-driven dynamic wrinkles, which can be used as dynamic biomimetic fingerprints. The randomness and unpredictability of the wrinkles' morphology enable them to be analogous to the minutiae of fingerprints. The dynamic nature of the fingerprint-like wrinkles endows them with hidden information to further improve security levels, and their NIR-responsiveness can help maintain a nearly identical topography during the cycles of erasure and regeneration, thus truly realizing unclonable anticounterfeiting. On the basis of these characteristics of NIR-driven dynamic wrinkles, such as simple preparation and easy readout, unique and unclonable identity tags were fabricated for antique authentication, which can be further combined with fluorescence patterns to achieve multiple anticounterfeiting technologies.",

Herein, we report a new class of nanocarriers, composed of imidazolium (IM)-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which can efficiently traverse past pollen barriers and deliver genes without external physical aid. IM-SWNTs display high biocompatibility with pollen grains, compared to existing SWNT nanocarriers previously used for cargo delivery into living plant cells. Using IM-SWNTs as nanotransporters, we investigate the compatibility of various pollen-specific promoters with oil palm pollen transcription machinery. We show that nanoparticle transport past the pollen plasma membrane is mainly controlled by its zeta potential, and we describe this entry mechanism with the lipid exchange envelope penetration model. We further estimate the pollen membrane effective dielectric constant with this model. These findings provide insights for the rational design and refinement of nanocarriers for plant biotechnology applications.",

P2-type layered oxides are important as cathodes for their reversibility, but their long-term performance in full cells remains a key challenge. Herein, we report Na0.75Co0.125Cu0.125Fe0.125Ni0.125Mn0.5O2 with an intergrowth of ordered P2 and P3 phases, studied by neutron diffraction and Rietveld refinement. A stable electrochemical performance is achieved in Na half cells with 100% capacity retention at a rate of C/10 after 100 cycles (initial capacity of 90 mAh/g), 96% capacity retention at a rate of 1 C after 500 cycles (initial capacity of 70 mAh/g), and 85% capacity retention at a rate of 5 C after 1000 cycles (initial capacity of 55 mAh/g). Stable full cell performance is achieved with 84.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at a rate of 1 C. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, and imaging are applied to elucidate the relationship between chemical/structural evolution and battery performance. A reversible local and global structural evolution is observed during initial cycles. Meanwhile, the challenges with enabling prolonged cycling (beyond 1000 cycles) may be associated with Fe dissolution and formation of a copper oxide phase. This study implies that cathodes with complex chemical and structural formations may stabilize electrochemical performance and highlights the importance of decoupling the contribution of each transition metal to performance degradation.",

One such class of materials, single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SIPEs), prevents the formation of ion concentration gradients and buildup of anions at the electrode surface, improving performance. One of the ongoing challenges for SIPEs is the development of materials that are conductive enough to compete with liquid electrolytes. Presented herein is a class of gel SIPEs based on crosslinked poly(tetrahydrofuran) diacrylate that present enhanced room temperature conductivities of 3.5 × 10–5 S/cm when gelled with lithium metal relevant 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane, 2.5 × 10–4 S/cm with carbonate solutions, and approaching 10–3 S/cm with dimethyl sulfoxide. Remarkably, these materials also demonstrate high ionic conductivity at low temperatures, 1.8 × 10–5 S/cm at −20 °C in certain solvents. Most importantly, however, when contrasted with identical SIPEs formulated with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced conductivity are elucidated: decreasing Li+–polymer interactions and gel solvent–polymer interactions leads to an increase in Li+ mobility. These findings are generalizable to various SIPE chemistries and can therefore be seen as an additional set of design parameters for developing future high conductivity SIPEs.",

However, characterization of this chloride layer has proven to be challenging because of the poor contrast provided by electron and X-ray scattering probes. Here, we show that small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) provides the compositional sensitivity needed to unambiguously quantify the PbClx shell that is present on the surface of PbCl2-derived PbS nanocrystals. Using a charge-balanced structural model, the scattering contribution of a ∼0.3 nm thick surface PbClx layer is parsed separately from ligand carboxylate head groups and PbS in the core. Global fitting of the SANS data across a solvent deuteration series enables unique determination of the spatial distribution of each material. These results are corroborated by quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). This work resolves a discrepancy in reported sizing curves for PbS nanocrystals prepared by different syntheses and further demonstrates the power of SANS in resolving molecular structure in soft and hybrid nanomaterials.",

Silicon, which is the second most earth-abundant element and a small band-gap material, is an applicable candidate for an efficient solar water splitting photoelectrode. However, the stability of Si-based photoelectrode hampers efficient water splitting, especially for the Si-based photoanodes because of its thermodynamic instability and etching of silicon surface. Until now, much research has been conducted to deal with the challenges of using Si to fabricate efficient and stable photoanodes. Over the decades, to expedite the oxygen evolution reaction, a complicated 4-electron transfer process and requires large overpotential, cheap and earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been investigated. In this Review, we briefly introduce the photoelectrochemistry and important parameters for evaluating the performance of the Si photoanodes. We summarize transition metal-based catalysts, focusing on Ni-, Co-, and Fe-based oxygen evolving catalysts. Then, we present various strategies to overcome the challenges of silicon by combining the advantages of transition metal-based oxygen evolving catalysts, which are cost-effective, stable, and highly active for oxygen evolution reaction. Finally, to realize spontaneous water splitting, we introduce Si-based tandem cells combined with transition metal-based materials.",

It is also found that the emission profile of original Sr2CaWO6:Mn4+ changes manifestly after different Ln3+ ions substitution, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of lattice distortion, Mn4+ transition 2Eg → 4A2g and lattice vibration. Most fascinatingly, the Sr2Ca0.9Ln0.1WO6:0.005Mn4+ (SC0.9Ln0.1WO:0.005Mn4+, Ln = La, Gd) show extraordinary luminescence thermal stability, whose integrated emission intensity still maintains about 95% (Gd, 96.8%; La, 94.8%) at 478 K of its original value at room temperature (298 K), much better than those in most reported Mn4+-activated oxide phosphors so far. It is confirmed that the traps may play an important role for this phenomenon. Best of all, this work gives us a facile strategy to achieve efficient Mn4+-activated red-emitting materials with extraordinary luminescence thermal stabilities derived from luminescence-ignorable ones.",

However, because of the crucial relationship between emission intensity and performance, pressure-quenching of optical emission greatly restrict the potential application of MHPs. Here, we reported the unique pressure-induced emission enhancement (PIEE) of CsPbxMn1–xCl3 NCs. Different from other PIEE phenomena, the PIEE of CsPbxMn1–xCl3 NCs was caused by the enhancement of energy release from 4T1 to 6A1 of the Mn, attributed to the pressure-induced isostructural phase transition. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence (PL) can exist until almost 20 GPa, suggesting that CsPbxMn1–xCl3 NCs exhibited better environmental suitability and worked under high pressure. Our studies explored the relationship between bandgap microstructure and optical properties of CsPbxMn1–xCl3 NCs at high pressure and also gave insights into the optimization of photovoltaic performance, which promoting the design of functional MHPs.",

    "abstract": "Proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are one type of promising energy device with clean and high efficiency characteristics. The sluggish kinetic characteristics of cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are still the bottleneck of the crucial skill. Until now, the exploitation of high ORR performance nanocatalysts has been the most effective strategy to the commercial of PEMFCs. Hence, more attention is paid to preciously tuning the surface/interface electronic structure and optimizing the intermediate species of adsorption energy of nanocatalysts to improve the ORR performance. Herein, performance-construction engineering is introduced in terms of surface strain, defect site (adsorption site/coordination number effect), and crystal facet for Pt-based catalysts. The physical synergy between Pt-based and carbon-based catalysts is also systematically reported focusing on ordered and mesoporous carbon, physical encapsulated carbon, metal carbides, carbon-containing polymer, etc. for ORR mainly in acidic environment. The understanding, construction, and application of the ORR active sites combined the carbon-based and platinum-based catalysts are deeply concluded in low-temperature PEMFCs, as well as part of high-temperature PEMFCs under acidic environment. The doping strategy and the strong interaction are highlighted introduced to enhance the intrinsic activity and the apparent activity. Furthermore, to study the complex active sites of catalysts and the corresponding compositional and structural evolution, the structure–activity relationships are further depicted coupled with the existing advanced in situ characterization technology. Finally, the potential prospects and challenges for the two types of electrocatalysts are summarized to shed a new light for the development of ORR catalysts in commercial applications.",

Using in situ high-pressure powder X-ray diffraction, however, we observe that this expected mechanical stability is not achieved when incorporating cerium or hafnium in UiO-66(Zr). This observation is akin to the earlier observed reduced thermal stability of UiO-66(Zr:Ce) compounds. To elucidate the atomic origin of this phenomenon, we chart the loss-of-crystallinity pressures of 22 monometallic and bimetallic UiO-66 materials and systematically isolate their intrinsic mechanical stability from their defect-induced weakening. This complementary experimental/computational approach reveals that the intrinsic mechanical stability of these bimetallic MOFs decreases nonlinearly upon cerium incorporation but remains unaffected by the zirconium: hafnium ratio. Additionally, all experimental samples suffer from defect-induced weakening, a synthesis-controlled effect that is observed to be independent of their intrinsic stability.",

Various synthesis approaches have been employed for 2D Xenes, nitrides, carbide, and oxides to obtain high-quality and large-quantity production. Among them, 2D oxides have gained researcher's attention for their magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties. In this Article, we report single-step and scalable synthesis of hematene (a 2D atomic layer of iron oxide (Fe2O3)) and 2D metal oxides (2DMOs), e.g., chromium oxide, copper oxide, etc., by following a similar synthesis protocol. Metal chlorides dispersed in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent immediately convert to the corresponding metal oxides upon microwave irradiation. Direct microwave solid-phase synthesis has also been explored and compared with liquid-phase microwave synthesis of hematene. Crystallographic structures of synthesized hematene were obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and chemical identification was done by X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, magnetic measurements reveal the room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering of hematene with a saturation magnetization of 0.24 emu/g (at 300 K) and 1.08 emu/g (at 60 K). Field-cooled and zero-field cooled measurements clearly demonstrate a high Curie temperature of ∼376 K. Versatility of the synthesis technique has been demonstrated by employing the same protocol to the successful synthesis of a variety of metal oxides. This synthesis route permits a simple, inexpensive, efficient, and scalable production of 2DMOs.",

The anode material, which is one of the critical battery components, influences the electrochemical performance as well as the commercialization in a significant way. Metal/metalloid-based materials operating through alloying reactions to store K+ are predominantly interesting, because of their appealing theoretical volumetric capacities. However, this type of anode is far from satisfactory and faces several obstacles, requiring an analysis concentrating on the reaction mechanisms and identifying the development challenges, which is absent in the literature. This Review starts with evaluating the theoretical volumetric capacities and trend of metal/metalloid-based alloying anodes in PIBs, in addition to discussing their general reaction mechanisms. It then focuses on their detailed potassiation mechanism, enhancement strategies, and structure–performance relationship, besides the influence from the electrolyte, binder, and separator. In the end, this critical review sheds light on what are learned from the previous results and proposes potential solutions to further elevate metal/metalloid-based alloying anodes, which could benefit the development of PIBs significantly.",

However, recent studies found that RIM cannot fully explain the behavior of some new systems because of the existence of extra nonradiative excited state channels. In this work, two D-π-A type molecules, TPA-P-C and CBZ-P-C with AIE properties, were prepared via the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction. CBZ-P-C showed an unusual solvent effect, being nonemissive in low-polar solvents but highly emissive in polar solvents. Theoretical calculations and time-resolved spectroscopic experiments demonstrated for CBZ-P-C a quantitative intersystem crossing (ISC) in low-polar solvents, resulting in low emission quantum yield but high singlet oxygen generation. In addition, a rigid matrix (triphenylphosphine (TPP)) was selected as host for the stabilization of the triplet excitons. Both doping materials showed high room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) as a consequence of the highly efficient triplet exciton generation. The present study provides a new insight for understanding AIE materials and paves an easy yet efficient way for the excited-state modulation of AIE molecules.",

A charge transfer complex of coronene and tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone was constructed as a proof-of-concept, which showed various jumping behaviors (including directional jumping) and reversible ON/OFF switching of luminescence under thermal stimuli.

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are important cellular organelles associated with many physiological processes. To visualize and study LDs, particularly the nascent LDs (diameters of 30–60 nm), super-resolution fluorescence imaging techniques with nanoscale resolution are regarded as the most appealing tools. However, this idea is largely limited by the availability of advanced LDs fluorescent probes that are capable of the proper super-resolution imaging techniques. Therefore, visualizations of LDs at the nanoscale resolution are very challenging and highly attractive. Herein, a distyrylbenzene-based molecule Lipi-DSB is sophisticatedly developed as a new LDs fluorescent probe that is capable of the stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution imaging. The probe Lipi-DSB displays superior properties including high photostability and brightness, large Stokes shift, low saturation intensity for STED laser, and good staining specificity toward LDs. Employing this fluorescent probe for STED imaging provides the state-of-the-art super-resolution imaging of LDs in terms of (1) the highest resolution (58 nm) of LDs up to date; (2) the maximum frames (1000 frames, 21.8 min) of time-lapse live imaging of LDs; (3) the first visualization of the fusion process of nascent LDs; (4) and the highest quality of 3D imaging of LDs. Thus, the dynamics and spatial distribution of LDs are visualized at the unprecedented nanoscale resolution, highlighting the utility of this fluorescent probe in STED super-resolution imaging.",

In this work, we report intracellular radical polymerizations that are promoted by the redox response of the tumor microenvironment. In the presence of endogenous glutathione (GSH) and supplementary sodium ascorbate (NaAsc), a low dose of the Cu(II)–histidine complex could be continuously reduced into an active Cu(I) catalyst inside living cells to initiate the polymerization of N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide with 97% conversion within 2 h. This method exhibited selectivity toward cells with redox imbalance and proved that the critical factors of intracellular polymerization are related to the redox status of GSH/GSSG. The tumor cells could initiate the polymerization of acryloyl paclitaxel (Acr-PTX) into a paclitaxel-bearing polymer (poly-PTX), which induces the apoptosis of these tumor cells far more efficiently than monomeric forms of PTX. Our work demonstrates an innovative approach to synthesize functional polymers inside living tumor cells by taking advantage of the local microenvironment of cells and also to direct the fate of tumor cells using the in situ synthesized polymers. This work will motivate the design of radical polymerization of acrylamide inside cells toward solving challenges of tumor therapy with high spatial and temporal resolution.",

Direct C–H activation methods have emerged and developed over the last 10 years to become an invaluable synthetic tool for the preparation of conjugated polymers for both redox-active and solid-state applications. Here, we evaluate direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP) methods for the synthesis of indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-based polymers. We demonstrate, using a range of techniques, including direct visualization of individual polymer chains via high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, that DHAP can produce polymers with a high degree of regularity and purity that subsequently perform in organic thin-film transistors comparably to those made by other cross-coupling polymerizations that require increased synthetic complexity. Ultimately, this work results in an improved atom economy by reducing the number of synthetic steps to access high-performance molecular and polymeric materials.",

However, often ignored is the effect of solvent polarity on the stability of these nanoplatelets. When perovskite nanoplatelets are exposed to small amounts (<1 vol %) of mildly polar solvents such as acetonitrile, the particles rapidly grow to larger nanostructures. Their quantum confinement is lost as they grow from uniform 2.6 nm thick particles to large nanostructures ∼85 nm in size. This ripening brings characteristic red-shifts in the absorption and photoluminescence of the particles as they transform. Using methyl acetate as a model polar solvent, we succeeded in establishing factors that control ligand desorption and lowering of the activation energy for ripening. These results highlight the challenges in using these quantum-confined nanoplatelets in applications such as photocatalysis, where polar solvents and/or intermediates may be unavoidable.",

Membrane-free redox stratified batteries, wherein electroactive materials in immiscible nonaqueous and aqueous solvents as anolyte and catholyte, have emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate the high dependence of RFBs on battery separators. Here we report the exploration of the application of immiscible electrolytes, water and dichloromethane, in membrane-free redox stratified batteries. With 0.5 M phenothiazines in dichloromethane as the catholytes and zinc metal in aqueous electrolyte as the anolyte, the aqueous/nonaqueous stratified battery presents stable long cycling with a capacity retention of 79.1% over 202 cycles under ambient testing conditions. Study of phenothiazines with varying lengths of alkyl chains (C0, C3, C8, and C18) reveals that the hydrophobicity of the phenothiazine molecules greatly affects the solubility in dichloromethane and battery cyclability. Computation on free energy of solvation and molecular dynamics is also performed to elucidate the hydrophobicity effects.

Three model compounds (8T, 8T-2F, and TT-2Cl) are prepared to deeply study the miscibility of the donors and acceptors in the active layers.

    "abstract": "Electrochemical water splitting operated under acidic conditions provides a clean approach to generate hydrogen fuels. Currently, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is a bottleneck limiting the acidic water splitting. Here, we report that the OER activity of Ir, one of the most commonly used OER catalysts, can be boosted by forming phase boundaries with Au. Mixed Au and Ir catalysts were synthesized on carbon paper electrodes, which underwent structural evolution under the OER environment to form an Au–Ir interface-rich structure. Compared with Ir catalyst, which requires an overpotential of ∼393 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, the evolved Au–Ir catalyst shows a lower overpotential at ∼351 mV. X-ray photoelectronic spectrum (XPS) study, in conjunction with electrochemical analysis on the surface-site-normalized activity, reveals that the improved OER performance is due to the presence of Au/Ir interfaces in the catalysts. In addition to Ir, the strategy of accelerating OER via Au/Ir interfaces has been further applied to IrCo, IrNi, and IrCu alloy catalysts. With the broad applicability of the strategy demonstrated, this study opens a new route to design OER catalysts for efficient acidic water splitting.",

    "abstract": "Fabrication of highly active carbon-supported atomically isolated metal catalysts with maximized atomic efficiency is significant but remains a big challenge because the adjacent metal species are easy to be aggregated during pyrolysis. Herein, a spatial sites separation strategy is developed to fabricate fully atomically isolated nickel catalysts for highly efficient CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). The porous porphyrinic triazine frameworks (designated as PTF-Zn, PTF-ZnNix, and PTF-Ni100, x = 5, 20, refers to molar percentage of Ni-TPPCN monomer) were first obtained by the polymerization of the monomers 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-cyanophenyl)porphyrin (TPPCN) or [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-cyanophenyl)porphyrinato]-Ni (Ni-TPPCN) with different molar ratios in the presence of ZnCl2. The distances between the Ni-N4 units that spatially separated by in situ formed Zn-N4 units in these PTF frameworks can be controlled by tuning the ratio of the monomers of Ni-TPPCN and TPPCN. Thus, because of the successful implementation of spatial sites separation strategy, pyrolysis of PTF-ZnNi5 that the Ni-N4 units were separated by Zn-N4 moieties afforded Ni5-PFT-1000 with fully atomically isolated Ni active sites. In contrast, pyrolysis of PTF-ZnNi20 or PTF-Ni100 led to porous carbon catalysts containing nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) because of the very limited spatial separation of Ni-N4 units with or without Zn-N4, allowing Ni migration and aggregation to occur. Consequently, porous Ni5-PTF-1000 was highly active for CO2RR toward CO with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94% at −0.9 V, larger CO partial current density of 18.4 mA cm–2, high turnover frequency value (TOF) of 20180 h–1 at −1.0 V. In contrast, Ni20-PFT-1000 and Ni100-PFT-1000 containing Ni NPs had lower FE of 79.7% and 6.8%, respectively, for the conversion of CO2-to-CO at the same potential. This work presents a facile way to achieve highly active catalyst with fully atomically dispersed sites for CO2RR catalysis.",

Here, we report that this thermal reduction process is geometry-dependent for bulk GO solids, including the peak temperature of reaction, reaction rate, the chemical composition of released gases, and the C/O ratio of the resulting r-GO products, which can be largely attributed to additional reactions between trapped reaction intermediates. The work enriches the knowledge base of GO materials and offers insights for further tuning of the thermal reduction of GO solids to obtain high performance engineering graphene materials.",

Here, we propose a 2D-silicon semiconductor by introducing kagome topology into the honeycomb lattice, i.e., a hybrid honeycomb-kagome (hhk) structure that is referenced as hhk-silicene. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate the high geometric stability and excellent semiconducting properties of the hhk-silicene, which opens up an electronic bandgap comparable to that of the bulk silicon and bears an electron mobility as high as that of the honeycomb silicene. By designing a field-effect transistor based on the hhk-silicene, giant negative differential resistance and switching performance fulfilling the requirements of ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) are predicted.

However, like blue LEDs, ECP-Yellow is on the difficult end of the spectrum, and general approaches that stabilize ECP-Yellow over long cycling remain elusive. Here we demonstrate an effective strategy to improve the cycling stability of ECP-Yellow and introduce the general concept of the effective overpotential (ηeff), defined as the difference between the oxidation onset potential and the open-circuit potential (ηeff = EOX,onset – EOC). We show that it is the lower ηeff, instead of popular strategies of lowering EOX,onset alone, that leads to stable cycling of ECP-Yellow. As a proof of concept, classical 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene-alt-phenylene yellow copolymer (PProDOT-Ph) is demonstrated with an unprecedented 3000 full-contrast switching cycles in a three-electrode liquid cell and a record high of 20 000 switching cycles in solid-state devices.

Among the strategies to achieve synergy between mechanical and electrical properties, near-amorphous polymers are competitive candidates due to their advantages of intrinsic flexibility, high mobility, and high reproducibility. Near-amorphous polymers with excellent performance are continuing to attract attention, and recently, some significant progress has been achieved in this field. In this perspective, we summarize these excellent advances on near-amorphous polymers from the point of view of their molecular design principles, their resulting charge transport and mechanical properties, and their potential applications in flexible electronic devices. Finally, we give a brief discussion on the challenges and opportunities of near-amorphous materials in flexible electronics from the perspectives of semiconductor layer materials themselves, devices, and multifunctional integration.",

In some cases, the optical activity is hypothesized to originate from a chiral morphology of the nanomaterial. However, quantifying the degree of chirality in objects with sizes of tens of nanometers is far from straightforward. Electron tomography offers the possibility to faithfully retrieve the three-dimensional morphology of nanomaterials, but only a qualitative interpretation of the morphology of chiral nanoparticles has been possible so far. We introduce herein a methodology that enables us to quantify the helicity of complex chiral nanomaterials, based on the geometrical properties of a helix. We demonstrate that an analysis at the single particle level can provide significant insights into the origin of chiroptical properties.",

    "abstract": "From the thermodynamic and kinetic viewpoints, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to the production of hydrogen through electrocatalytic water splitting process. As a result, extensive research is carried out with an aim to develop (preferably low cost) electrocatalysts for efficient OER reaction. Two main mechanisms, the lattice oxygen mediated mechanism (LOM) and the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), are proposed for the OER process, but the former seems to be favored as the latter is surrounded by a number of discrepancies. The LOM is based on the oxidation and reduction chemistry of lattice oxygen anions. Both from fundamental and application perspectives, identification and selection of crucial electronic and structural features to rationally tune the LOM for OER process and determine the rate of the OER reaction are essential but remain a challenge. As yet, this has largely been attempted by trial and error (synthesis and performance evaluation) approaches and, hence, has been tied up by tediousness and inefficiency. Considering the availability of large chemical space and huge probabilities in fine-tuning of electronic and structural attributes, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can be efficacious. To predict promising material features that enable rational design of OER electrocatalysts, electrocatalytic performance maps have been developed based on reactivity multiple descriptors. The reactivity multiple descriptors are numerous and are classified into several families. Therefore, modern materials informatics technique is urgently required to enable large-scale data mining to rapidly screen and select the best physical features from multiple descriptors for a rational design of LOM-induced OER electrocatalysts. In this context, feature selection by artificial intelligence-based approach can be a solution to such challenge. Yet to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made before to tune electrocatalysts for the OER through LOM reaction mechanism following feature selection by artificial intelligence-based approach.",

The results suggest that the 2e– ORR performance depends on the C═O/O–C–O ratio.

Additionally, this combination exhibits considerably stable performance during long-term (12 h) durability test, demonstrating approximately 100% current retention. The experimental results were further supported by theoretical calculation, exhibiting optimal adsorption free energy of OOH* for the couple of pyrrolic N and carbonyl O.",

In this study, the orientation control of 2D perovskite on 3D perovskite was realized to overcome the trade-off between stability and PCE of 2D/3D heterostructure. 2D perovskite fabricated on (110)-oriented MAPbI2.5Cl0.5 was horizontally oriented to the substrate surface. In contrast, 2D perovskite fabricated on (200)/(112)-oriented MAPbI3 was obliquely oriented at 45° to the substrate surface. The change of orientation angle in 2D perovskite strongly depended upon the predominant crystal orientation of 3D perovskite template. The tolerance of lattice matching between 3D and 2D perovskite must allow the orientation control.

However, the inherent characteristics of PDI molecules, including poor water solubility, short-wavelength absorption, and negligible singlet oxygen (1O2) generation capabilities, severely limit their application in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Here, a novel PDI-based photosensitizer was deliberately designed with the potential to solve these limitations. By facile modifications of a PDI molecule, we constructed an amphiphilic PDI-based compound (PDIPa) that can be self-assembled into a functional supramolecular photosensitizer (NanoPDIPa) with excellent water dispersity and intense near-infrared (NIR) absorbance. Remarkably, the intermolecular electronic coupling and interaction in NanoPDIPa can induce efficiency intersystem crossing (ISC) through the minimization of singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔEST), a characteristic that is not possessed by the monomer, thus resulting in significant 1O2 production. The successful development of NanoPDIPa not only can enlarge the family of NIR-absorbing photosensitizers for potential PDT applications but also can provide a solution to overcome the limitations of clinically used photosensitizers.",

    "abstract": "Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites (VODPs) have been widely explored throughout the past few years as promising lead-free alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Yet, the atomic-scale mechanisms that underlie their optical properties remain elusive. In this work, a thorough investigation of the excitonic properties of key members within the VODP family is presented. We employ state-of-the-art ab initio calculations and unveil critical details regarding the role of electron–hole interactions in the electronic and optical properties of VODPs. The materials family is sampled by picking prototypes based on the electronic configuration of the tetravalent metal at the center of the octahedron. Hence, groups with a valence comprised of s, p, and d closed shells are represented by the known materials Cs2SnX6, Cs2TeX6, and Cs2ZrX6 (with X = Br, I), respectively. The electronic structure is investigated within the G0W0 many-body Green's function method, while the Bethe–Salpeter equation is solved to account for electron–hole interactions that play a crucial role in the optical properties of the family. A detailed symmetry analysis unravels the fine structure of excitons for all compounds. The exciton binding energy, excitonic wavefunctions, and the dark–bright splitting are also reported for each material. It is shown that these quantities can be tuned over a wide range, from Wannier- to Frenkel-type excitons, through for example substitutional engineering. In particular, Te-based materials, which share the electronic valency of corner-sharing Pb halide perovskites, are predicted to have exciton binding energies of above 1 eV and a dark–bright splitting of the excitons reaching over 100 meV. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the optical properties of the entire family of VODP materials and highlight how these are not, in fact, suitable Pb-free alternatives to traditional halide perovskites.",

In this work, we characterize the temporal evolution of the surface relief grating (SRG) morphology fabricated by means of interference lithography on azopolymer films, quantitatively relating the results of a Fourier analysis of their surface profiles to the accurate measurement of efficiencies in the transmitted diffraction orders. A reliable surface structuration dynamics is empirically extracted from the analysis and used to formulate a simple but detailed diffraction model that, within the scalar diffraction theory, exhaustively describes the diffraction behavior of real SRGs without the need of complex rigorous electromagnetic theories. Our results add a deeper insight in the quantitative description of the morphology and the diffraction behavior of SRGs, which can contribute to their adoption for operating high-performance, reconfigurable, compact, and lightweight diffractive optical devices.",

The achieved overpotential was as low as 19.8 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 while maintaining an ultrareliable performance for 60 h in 1.0 M KOH solution, exhibiting 5- and 10-times higher performance than those of traditional Pt60Ni15P25 and Pd40Ni40P20 metallic glasses, respectively, and also surpassing the benchmark performance of commercial Pt/C nanoparticles and pure Pt sheet. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that the enhanced HER activity was ascribed to a synergistic function of multiprincipal components that optimized the electronic structure to accelerate the rate-determining steps in HER. Moreover, the unique long-range disordered structure provided a high density of unsaturated atomic coordination that was able to improve the amount of electrochemically active sites.

Herein, an architected foamy AC by melamine polymer and silica aerogel particles is demonstrated as a proof-of-concept. The high-porosity foamy AC can achieve much lower thermal conductivity and less heat release as well as superhydrophobicity and excellent fire resistance.

The V-doped MoO3 nanospheres are embedded densely into a porous interlaced poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) network for solar seawater desalination. The harvested light is efficiently converted to local heat for interfacial seawater evaporation due to the strong light absorption of the doped nanospheres, the reabsorption of the scattered light by the closely packed nanospheres, and the low thermal conductivity of the PVA network. The solar absorber film containing 33.3 mol % V-doped MoO3 nanospheres gives a fast seawater evaporation rate of 2.01 kg m–2 h–1 and a high solar energy conversion efficiency of 93.44%.

However, in contrast to the rapid enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE), the operational stability of single-crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains far lagging behind. Herein, it is discovered that widely investigated 20 μm-thick single-crystal PSCs show poor operational stability, which is assigned to low crystal quality of these thin single crystals. Subsequently, the crystal quality of formamidinium0.55methylammonium0.45 lead triiodide (FA0.55MA0.45PbI3) thin single crystals are optimized by adjusting the ion diffusion velocity in confined space, leading to lower trap density, larger ion migration activation energy, and reduced light-induced degradation of material properties. As a result, stable single-crystal PSCs with no efficiency degradation after 330 h of continuous operation at the maximum power point under 1 sun illumination are achieved. Moreover, thickness-dependent device efficiency discloses an ultralong carrier transport length of 200 μm in FA0.55MA0.45PbI3 thin single crystals, which is instructive for developing lateral-structure solar cells.",

When it serves as photoanodes for solar water oxidation, Si corrodes continuously, because of thermodynamically favorable anodic oxidation of Si surface to SiOx and the subsequent dissolution in alkaline electrolytes. The instability becomes the main bottleneck that limits its further application, and thus stabilization of Si under operation conditions constitutes a key step in developing an integrated device for large-scale and practical PEC water splitting systems. Although a variety of designs are currently being proposed to create stable and efficient n-Si photoelectrodes, a comprehensive understanding of the operation and failure mechanism of these photoelectrodes is still lacking. Here, we outline the basic principles and recent advancements of n-Si photoanodes with different device configurations and discuss the merits and major challenges of these protection strategies. Emphasis is placed on the construction of a novel multifunctional protective layer that simultaneously optimizes the charge carrier transport and corrosion resistance of n-Si photoelectrodes. Finally, a perspective regarding the key challenges and future direction for the design of novel structures, the engineering of the interface, the enhancement of stability, and the utilization of advanced in situ techniques is also presented.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of some chromophores generates very strong fluorescence signals due to the tight molecular packing and highly restricted vibrational motions in the electronically excited states. Such an aggregation-induced emission enhancement enables great strides in biomedical imaging, security screening, sensing, and light communication applications. Here, we realized efficient utilization of a series of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) in X-ray imaging scintillators and optical wireless communication (OWC) technology. Ultrafast time-resolved laser spectroscopic experiments and high-level density functional theory (DFT) calculations clearly demonstrate that a significant increase in the rotational energy barrier in the aggregated state of AIEgens is observed, leading to highly restricted molecular vibrations and suppressed nonradiative processes. AIEgen-based scintillators exhibit a high X-ray imaging resolution of 16.3 lp mm–1, making them excellent candidates for X-ray radiography and security inspections. In addition, these AIEgens show a broad -3-dB modulation bandwidth of ∼110 MHz and high net data rates of ∼600 Mb/s, demonstrating their high potential for application in the field of high-speed OWC.",

    "abstract": "Regulating the crystallization dynamics and suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+ is imperative for the emerging lead-free tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). In this respect, quasi-2D tin perovskites exhibit relatively slow crystallization and crystal growth rate compared to the three-dimensional analogues. However, these dimensional-mixed tin perovskites suffer from random orientation, which limits the charge carrier transport for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we report a facile and feasible strategy to modulate the dimensionality and crystallization of tin perovskites with the incorporation of phenethylammonium thiocyanate (PEASCN), which is exploited to deliver a high-quality crystal growth and preferred alignment. The pseudohalide SCN– can effectively hinder Sn2+ oxidation by synergistically modulating the coordination and crystal growth of Sn perovskite films. Meanwhile, these interactions significantly suppressed the nonradiative charge recombination. Finally, a high efficiency approaching 12.88% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 863 mV is achieved for the inverted TPSCs. The obtained Voc is among the highest reported values for indene-C60 (ICBA)-free TPSC devices. The PEASCN devices also exhibited high stability for over 2000 h under a N2 atmosphere.",

Herein, a flexible Co9S8-carbon nanofibers composite foam (Co9S8@CF-700) with unique ganglion-like architecture is ingeniously designed and synthesized through an electrospinning strategy. Tested as an LIBs anode, a carbon nanofibers network with prominent conductivity, highly reversible additional capacity, and excellent buffering capability ensure the enhanced conversion reaction kinetics of flexible Co9S8@CF-700 relative to Co9S8 nanoparticles. Furthermore, a comprehensive high temporal-spatial resolution in situ measurement system combining in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ magnetometry techniques is proposed and applied to reveal the adsorption-conversion-space charge/intercalation lithium storage mechanism of Co9S8@CF-700. Specifically, in situ XRD detects the conversion reaction in the medium voltage region, and the in situ magnetometry monitors the capacitive behavior in the high-voltage region and the space charge/intercalation lithium storage behavior in the low-voltage region.

Although a commercial zeolite-represented hemostatic agent has been widely used, zeolite-induced thermal damages to tissues are unresolved, and antibacterial and wound healing are desirably demanded but challenging. Herein, a composite zeolite-based hemostat spray consisting of Ag-doped β zeolite (Ag-βZ) and coupled fibrinogen/thrombin (F/T) has been developed to seal postsurgical blood burst. Systematic experiments reveal that the F/T can be switched into fibrin gel as the physical barrier and cover Ag-βZ, which imparts the composite hemostats with the most robust hemostasis ability associated with the lowest bleeding amount and the shortest hemostasis time. Concurrently, the physical barrier can shield Ag-βZ from touching water, reduce solvothermal release, and significantly minimize temperature, consequently resulting in no obvious thermal effect on the surrounding tissues. Importantly, the in situ doping of Ag can produce reactive oxygen species to kill bacteria and ameliorate bacteria-aroused inflammation, which can be also leveraged to promote cell expansion for expediting wound healing.

    "abstract": "Electrode/electrolyte interfaces are the most important and least understood components of Li-ion and next-generation batteries. An improved understanding of interphases in batteries will undoubtedly lead to breakthroughs in the field. Traditionally, evaluating those interphases involves using ex situ surface sensitive and/or imaging techniques. Due to their very dynamic and reactive nature, ex situ sample manipulation is undesirable. From this point of view, operando surface sensitive techniques represent a major opportunity to push boundaries in battery development. While numerous bulk spectroscopic, scattering, and imaging techniques are well established and widely used, surface sensitive operando techniques remain challenging and, to a larger extent, restricted to the model systems. Here, we give a perspective on techniques with the potential to characterize solid/liquid interfaces in both model and realistic battery configurations. The focus is on techniques that provide chemical and structural information at length and time scales relevant for the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and evolution, while also probing representative electrode areas. We highlight the following techniques: vibrational spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), neutron and X-ray reflectometry, and grazing incidence scattering techniques. Comprehensive overviews, as well as promises and challenges, of these techniques when used operando on battery interphases are discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "Carbazole-based self-assembled monolayers (PACz-SAMs), anchored via their phosphonic acid group on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO), have demonstrated excellent performance as hole-selective layers in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Yet, whereas different PACz-SAMs have been explored, the role of the TCO, and specifically its microstructure, on the hole transport properties of the TCO/PACz-SAMs stack has been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that the TCO microstructure directly impacts the work function (WF) shift after SAM anchoring and is responsible for WF variations at the micro/nanoscale. Specifically, we studied Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) substrates with amorphous and polycrystalline (featuring either nanoscale- or microscale-sized grains) microstructures before and after 2PACz-SAMs and NiOx/2PACz-SAMs anchoring. With this, we established a direct correlation between the ITO crystal grain orientation and 2PACz-SAMs local potential distribution, i.e., the WF. Importantly, these variations vanish for amorphous oxides (either in the form of amorphous ITO or when adding an amorphous NiOx buffer layer), where a homogeneous surface potential distribution is found. These findings highlight the importance of TCO microstructure tuning, to enable both high mobility and broadband transparent electrodes while ensuring uniform WF distribution upon application of hole transport SAMs, both critical for enhanced device performance.",

In this work, by using density functional theory combined with deep potential model and grand potential phase diagram analysis, we report a new spinel chloride (Na2Y2/3Cl4) and systemically evaluate its potential for the solid electrolyte. The spinel Na2Y2/3Cl4 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.94 mS/cm at room temperature and has a three-dimensional isotropic diffusion network comprised of face-sharing octahedra and tetrahedra. Further analysis of the diffusion mechanism indicates that the Na+ conductivity mainly derives from Na ions in the 8a site while the Na ions in the 16d site are mainly used for forming the rhombus skeleton. Besides, the spinel Na2Y2/3Cl4 has a wide electrochemical window of 0.59–3.76 V and good interfacial stability with high-voltage cathodes, which ensures its ability to improve the energy density of ASIBs. This study demonstrates the promising application of the spinel framework in sodium solid electrolytes and sheds new light on developing the halide-based solid electrolyte for ASIBs.",

    "abstract": "Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) as a catalytic anticancer strategy utilizes transition metal ions to initiate the Fenton reaction to produce high levels of cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals(·OH) in situ. Nevertheless, current existing CDTs are normally restricted by the high levels of existing antioxidant molecules and/or enzymes, such as glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), in a tumor internal environment, which could suppress CDT via ·OH depletion. Herein, to enhance ·OH-induced cellular damage by CDT, a self-assembled copper-selenocysteine nanoparticles (Cu-SeC NPs) was fabricated through a one-pot process. In our design, once Cu-SeC NPs were endocytosed by tumor cells, Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+ by cellular GSH, promoting in situ Fenton-like reactions to trigger ·OH rapid production in cells as well as the depletion of GSH. Furthermore, the gradually released selenocysteine can inhibit TrxR activity to weaken the protection of antioxidant systems and provide a favorable microenvironment for CDT. As a result, both paths synergistically resulted in massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and amplified oxidative stress in tumor sites for enhanced CDT. As a new intelligent anticancer nanoplatform, Cu-SeC NPs exhibit synergistic antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity. Thus, the proposed strategy provides a new avenue for further development of progressive therapeutic systems.",

    "abstract": "Conductive and self-healing (SH) hydrogels have been receiving continuous attention, which could broaden the design of ionotronic devices for health monitoring systems and soft robots with the ability to repair damage autonomously. So far, three-dimensional (3D) fabrication of such SH hydrogels is mainly limited to traditional molding/casting or extrusion-based 3D printing methods, which limits the formation of sophisticated structures with high-resolution features. Furthermore, the need of external stimuli (e.g., water, heat, and pH change) to achieve SH behavior could restrict their wide application. Herein, we report an ion-conductive SH hydrogel suitable for a home-built high-resolution and high-speed 3D printing process, micro continuous liquid interface production (μCLIP). This material system relies on interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN) hydrogel formed by physically cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) combined with chemically/ionically cross-linked poly(acrylic acid) and ferric chloride. By carefully optimizing the resin's composition, we can balance high-resolution printability and superb SH capability, at the same time manifesting sufficient ion conductivity. Specifically, complex 3D structures with microscale features (down to 100 μm) can be printed at speeds up to 16.5 μm s–1. Upon damage occurs, hydrogen bonds within hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, as well as ionic bonds generated from ferric ions, contribute together to achieve fast and high efficiency SH, which can restore 90% (100%) of the original mechanical strength at room temperature within 4 h (8 h) without any external stimulus. In addition, both the as-printed and self-healed hydrogels manifest superior ion conductivity and stretchability. Therefore, the SH hydrogels can be rapidly printed and tailored as customized wearable sensors, and the sensing capabilities were quantitatively investigated and compared. In terms of applications, SH hydrogel-based knuckle sensors were prototyped to detect a finger's folding and unfolding motions.",

However, the synthesis of vinylene-linked COFs remains challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of monomers with adjustable structures and high reactivity. In this regard, we propose an efficient strategy to expand the repertoire of vinylene-linked COFs by introducing a novel type of tritopic 2-methylpyridine-mediated building block that integrates active methylene sites and tunable functional backbones. By utilizing these tritopic building blocks, a series of isoreticular vinylene-linked two-dimensional (2D) COFs can be readily constructed via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The resulting 2D COFs exhibit remarkable crystallinity, stability, and tunable optoelectronic properties, enabling them to function as highly efficient photocatalysts for visible-light-driven thiocyanation reactions. The incorporation of diverse 2-methylpyridine-mediated building blocks would lead to unlocking a plethora of new vinylene-linked COFs, providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the largely unexplored chemistry and properties of this fascinating class of materials.",

    "abstract": "Ti3C2Tx, the most popular MXene to date, is widely regarded as a metallic material, based on numerous theoretical predictions and the results of experimental studies. Yet, despite this general consensus on the metallic nature of Ti3C2Tx, there have not been reports on its temperature-dependent resistivity (ρ) measurements that would demonstrate the expected increase of resistivity with temperature with dρ/dT > 0 in a wide temperature range. Instead, all ρ(T) data reported so far, which were mostly collected on macroscopic films of percolating Ti3C2Tx flakes, demonstrate dependences with minima, which were observed in the range from 90 to 250 K in different measurements. In this study, we fabricated electronic devices based on individual high-quality Ti3C2Tx flakes and performed their temperature-dependent resistivity measurements. The resistivity of flakes was found to increase with temperature in the 10–300 K range, and the resulting ρ(T) dependences can be accurately described by the Bloch–Grüneisen model for the temperature dependence of the resistivity of metals, confirming the metallic nature of Ti3C2Tx. We also demonstrate that an oxidation of a Ti3C2Tx monolayer transforms a monotonically increasing ρ(T) curve into a dependence with a minimum that looks similar to the previously reported results for percolating MXene films. The emerging low-temperature tail with a semiconductor-like dρ/dT < 0 behavior can be explained by the stronger electron scattering in a partially oxidized MXene due to an increased level of disorder, and the resulting ρ(T) curves can be accurately fitted using Matthiessen's rule, which incorporates the effect of all types of scatterers on the transport properties of metals. These experiments verify the metallic nature of Ti3C2Tx (dρ/dT > 0) and provide insights into the origin of the emergence of a low-temperature tail with dρ/dT < 0. We also demonstrate that multilayer Ti3C2Tx flakes retain their purely metallic dρ/dT > 0 behavior even after annealing in air, suggesting that the outer layers of multilayer flakes effectively protect the core layers from oxidation. This result suggests that certain applications may benefit from the use of multilayer flakes because of their improved environmental stability.",

    "abstract": "Several polymorphs of MoO3 with different crystal and electronic structures provide many opportunities to find suitable electrocatalysts for water splitting hydrogen generation. So far, promising electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been found for α-MoO3 (orthorhombic), while the polymorph has shown a poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. In this work, it is found that the intrinsic OER activity of α-MoO3 is remarkably improved by incorporating guest ions of lithium-ion (Li+). α-MoO3 nanoparticles were deposited on a carbon fiber paper (α-MoO3/CFP) by chemical vapor transport and a subsequent lithiation process was applied to prepare lithiated α-MoO3/CFP (Li-α-MoO3/CFP), showing the robust η10 of 458 mV. The improved OER activity in the lithiated electrode is attributed to the incorporation of Li+ into the MoO3, which increases the electron carrier density and the corresponding electrical conductivity, thereby improving the interfacial charge transfer kinetics as well as activating a large number of ECSA.",

The Nb2O5 device is fabricated with the top Cu and bottom Au electrodes, which is fabricated at a fully room temperature process, exhibiting excellent resistive switching performance with an on/off ratio of up to 105 and ultralow operating voltage. The multilevel resistive switching characteristic can be rationally demonstrated by changing the compliance current in the Nb2O5 device. Each level of the resistance state is uniform with distinguishable read windows. The reset voltage reduces significantly as the compliance current decreases, which is merely 0.002 V when the compliance current is 10–5 A. An approach of the broken-down device is elaborately developed to firmly identify the migration of Cu and the existence of a Cu conductive filament and to explain the ultralow operating voltage. Amorphous Nb2O5 devices exhibit excellent resistive switching performance, proving it is a promising material for memory applications.",

    "abstract": "High oxidative stress plays a significant role in activating intracellular signaling pathways that govern immunogenic cell death (ICD). Nevertheless, immune response is often confined by limited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, upregulated antioxidant defense, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, the GSH/pH-sensitive Mn2+/polydopamine-incorporated hollow mesoporous tetrasulfide-bridged organosilica nanoreactors loaded with l-arginine (l-Arg) were successfully constructed (A@MnHMONs-PEG). Under near-infrared light (NIR) illumination, the programmed nanoreactors directly generate a large amount of ROS via \"Mn2+-based Fenton-like catalysis and tetrasulfide bridge-mediated GSH depletion\" for photothermal-intensified chemodynamic therapy, meanwhile ROS could oxidize the guanidine groups of l-Arg to produce nitric oxide (NO) for gas therapy. Moreover, both photothermal and massive ROS substantially induce cancer immune responses by up-regulating ICD. Furthermore, the more powerful peroxynitrite anion (ONOO–) is sequentially generated through the interaction of ROS and NO. It could polarize macrophages from M2 into M1 phenotype to reverse immunosuppression and enhance immune response. In vivo experiments conclusively prove that our programmed nanoreactors could combine photothermal-chemodynamic-NO therapy and concurrently enhance immune response via ROS cascade amplification along with ONOO– storm for elimination of the primary tumor and inhibition of recurrence/metastasis. Our programmed nanoreactors open up new paths for improving the anticancer immune response.",

Herein, we show a simple but general synthesis of multiple-component COFs through an in-situ approach. In the simplest C4 + C2 binary condensation system, we observed substitute-induced in-situ formed linkers and consequently a conversion from a two-component sql COF to a three-component sql-defect COF. However, in another C4 + C3 binary condensation system, we observed both topology- and substitute-induced in-situ formed linkers and finally a conversion from a three-component 3,4-connected COF to a two-component hcb-defect COF. Such a difference in the topology between three- and two-component COFs is very different from the established three-component COFs that show the same topology as observed in the comparable two-component COF. These new finds, as evidenced by both experimental and theoretical results, mainly originated from the steric hindrance effect. Moreover, we also disclosed a structure–function relationship among palladium recovery, substitute effect, and pore size of COFs, and one multiple-component COF was found to show benchmark performance in palladium recovery from strong acid (3 M). The results shed light on a fundamental design for a multiple-component COF and its advanced application.",

    "abstract": "Ga2O3-doped thin films exhibit great potential in terms of optical and electronic properties. However, efforts are needed to meet the challenge of obtaining high-quality films by doping to achieve high-performance ultraviolet (UV) detection with tunable detection wavelengths. In this work, zinc-doped gallium oxide (ZGO) thin films with different Ga:Zn ratios were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). During the film deposition, the plasma-enhanced ALD and thermal ALD were used alternately to grow Ga2O3 and ZnO layers, respectively. The as-investigated 15-nm ZGO films showed an accurate doping ratio and excellent uniformity. The bandgap (Eg) was found to be well-tunable from 4.45 eV to 3.21 eV with increasing Zn content. The electronic band structures and the relationship between energy levels were analyzed in detail. Furthermore, metal–semiconductor-metal devices based on the Ga:Zn 9:1, 5:5, and 1:9 films were fabricated for UV detection. The ZGO thin film photodetectors (PDs) exhibited extremely low dark current and an obvious rejection ratio of the responsivity (R) of 254 and 365 nm light, showing the trend in accordance with the Eg value. The Ga:Zn 5:5 PD presented high photo-to-dark current ratio of ∼7 × 104, high R of 17.6 A/W, and an excellent weak-light-detection ability shown by the linear dynamic range of ∼96.8 dB under 254 nm illumination. This work can fill the void of the doping research field and provide a feasible scheme for the development of a high-sensitivity photoelectric system.",

    "abstract": "The global nitrogen cycle has been destroyed by the quickly growing anthropogenic emissions of nitrite-containing pollutants during the past decades, which causes numerous unexpected environmental side effects and threatens human health. Compared with conventional nitrite removal methods featuring low efficiency, high cost, and secondary pollution, the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction has garnered significant attention and offers an appealing solution for nitrite removal and recovering the global nitrogen balance. Moreover, it takes a step further to convert nitrite into recyclable nitrogen-containing fertilizer including ammonia and urea. However, the materials design and mechanistic aspects for such emerging complex reactions are yet to be explored compared to other well-studied primary reactions such as oxygen reduction and water splitting. To address this challenge, this review provides a comprehensive account of a sustainable electrosynthesis of ammonia and urea from ambient nitrite reduction and C–N coupling. The two key reactions, namely ammonia production from the nitrite reduction reaction and urea synthesis from coreduction of nitrite and carbon dioxide, are elaborated in detail, with available catalysts as the focus of the discussion. The current technical barriers and potential research prospects in this domain, including exploring excellent electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity, precisely controlling the interfacial microenvironment, and understanding in-depth the reaction mechanism, are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of heteroatom-doped porous carbons for efficient electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two-electron (2e–) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted increasing research attention since it offers a promising renewable substitute for the traditional complex energy-intensive anthraquinone process. Herein, a novel pyrolysis-free mechanochemical approach was developed for straightforward conversion of small organic molecules into metal-free heteroatom-doped mesoporous carbons (HMCs), where the uniqueness of this one-pot ball-milling technique not only exceeds the limit of volatilities of traditional carbonaceous precursors but also eliminates the need for any additional mesoporous templates. The abundance of molecular precursors (up to 23 different molecules) provides a facile means to introduce a wide variety of heteroatoms (B, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, etc.) into the resultant carbon materials, accompanied by in situ formation of rich mesopores. As a result, the resulting N/O co-doped mesoporous carbon with the highest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 1238 m2 g–1 exhibits exceptional H2O2 selectivity of 95.2% in 0.1 M KOH solution at 0.70 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a large H2O2 production rate of ca. 265 mmol gcat.–1 h–1, ranking at the top among all metal-free carbonaceous electrocatalysts. We anticipate our findings will facilitate new possibilities for the development of mesoporous carbons for electrocatalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "Membrane technology is a key enabler for a circular pharmaceutical industry, but chemically resistant polymeric membranes for organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) often suffer from lower-than-required performances. Recently, graphene-based laminated membranes using small-flake graphene oxide (SFGO) nanosheets open up new avenues for high-performance OSN, but their permeance toward high viscosity solvents is below expectation. To address this issue, we design hyperlooping channels using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) intercalated within lanthanum(III) (La3+)-cross-linked SFGO nanochannels to form a ternary nanoarchitecture for low-resistant transport toward high viscosity solvents. At optimized MWCNT loading, the defect-free membrane exhibits 138 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 ethanol permeance at >99% rejections toward organic dyes, outperforming state-of-the-art graphene oxide (GO)-based membranes to date. Even butanol─with twice the viscosity of ethanol─exhibits a permeance no less than 60 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 at comparable rejection rates. Theoretical simulation suggests that La3+ cross-linking is critical and can create an intact architecture that brings size exclusion into play as the dominant separation mechanism. Also, MWCNT nanochannel offers at least 1.5-fold lower ethanol transport resistance than that of the GO nanochannel, owing to greater bulk freedom in orientating ethanol molecules. Overall, the hyperlooping architecture demonstrates ∼3-fold higher permeance than neat SFGO membrane for elevating OSN performances.",

Here, we demonstrate deposition of a ZnMgO window layer of controlled thickness, composition, and electro-optical properties by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The amorphous ZnMgO deposited at low temperature down to 100 °C using plasma-enhanced ALD showed smoothness superior to that of high-temperature plasma-enhanced ALD and doping density comparable to that of high-temperature thermal ALD but with a much lower electron affinity. The overall charge carrier recombination at the CZTS/ZnSnO/ZnMgO region was reduced due to the optimized ZnMgO conduction band minimum, thus reducing the VOC value and fill factor loss for a CZTS solar cell. In addition, the thinner- and larger-band-gap ZnMgO was believed to reduce the parasitic absorption, improving the JSC value and boosting the efficiency to 10%.",

    "abstract": "Precise design of photoactive molecules that switch reversibly upon visible-light irradiation is beneficial to develop photosensitive intelligent luminescence materials applied in biological imaging and anticounterfeiting. Herein, we designed a photochromic molecular switch (DAE-BTS) that incorporated cleverly two photoactive groups i.e. diarylethene (DAE) and benzothiazole thiophene styrene (T-BTS) via a π-extended conjugation strategy. T-BTS was undoubtedly identified as a new photo/thermo-controlled molecular switch through some standard characterizations in this work. Interestingly, when T-BTS was connected to the DAE skeleton, its photo/thermos-isomerization activation was restrained. On the contrary, incorporation of two T-BTS sections into the DAE skeleton did not affect photochromism of DAE. Hence, DAE-BTS not only possessed photochromic distinguishing feature but also maintained aggregation-induced emission enhancement characteristic. Moreover, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polypropylene (PP) were first innovatively integrated to form a solid-state composite film, which can supply adaptive nanopores as accommodations for DAE-BTS. The resultant luminescence film DAE-BTS/PMMA–PP exhibited much stronger solid-state fluorescence than DAE-BTS in only PMMA or PP film. Crucially, the formation of the DAE-BTS/PMMA–PP film drove DAE-BTS from the free rotating state to the restricted rotating state. This conformation-constrained strategy further achieved visible light-induced cyclization reaction of the DAE, and then the solid-state fluorescence switch was reversibly controlled by dual visible light, which might be applied in light-recording and anticounterfeiting. The study provided theoretical guidance to accurately design and prepare visible-light-activated DAE derivatives in both directions and optically modulated photoluminescence materials with excellent performance.",

The percentage of crystals with negative polarization is linearly proportional to the electric field strength, while the trend is slightly different when a positive electric field is applied. The minimum electric field strength needed to achieve peptides with a uniform polarization is about 200 kV/m. Due to the improved crystallinity and uniform polarization in peptides, the piezoelectric constant d33 increases linearly with the applied electric fields. The output voltage and current of peptide-based piezoelectric nanogenerators increase with the applied force on the device and with the electric field used for growth material, and the power density reaches 9.98 W/m3.

    "abstract": "Flash Joule heating (FJH) method is an emerging and powerful technique that has exhibited great potential in various domains. Herein, we successfully prepared flash graphene (FG)-supported Bi nanoparticles (Bi-NPs/FG) via the ultrafast and ecofriendly FJH method in less than 200 ms for the first time. Benefited from the synergistic effect of highly conductive FG and active Bi nanocrystals, the Bi-NPs/FG hybrid shows a highly selective CO2 electroreduction with an ultrahigh Faradaic efficiency of 93.8% toward C1 product (i.e., formate). Furthermore, the findings from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the reconstruction process not only enhances the bonding strength of the surface Bi-OCHO*, but also optimizes the adsorption energy of the key intermediate (OCHO*), thus benefiting the production of formate. In addition, we conducted an extension study of the FJH route to demonstrate its versatility in preparing a range of other metal/alloy NPs encased in FG. This work presents a feasible pathway to the superfast and massive production of highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion, and it can be extended to other application scenarios with great potential.",

    "abstract": "Phase-change materials (PCMs) have spurred intensive studies for information storage owing to huge and drastic changes in physical properties (i.e., optical and resistivity) during the phase transitions between crystalline-amorphous and crystalline-melting-glassy states. However, limited switching properties and materials greatly hinder their development and applications. Herein, we report a pair of hybrid metal halides (R/S-2-HMM)3SbCl6 (2-HMM = 2-(hydroxymethyl)morpholine cation) as model compounds of a new class of photoluminescent PCMs. They undergo a stable melt process and become amorphous glass by melt-quenching. The crystalline phase exhibits near-unity yellow photoluminescence with a 95% quantum yield due to the radiative recombination of self-trapped excitons in the excited state of [SbCl6]3– octahedra. The glass phase exhibits an orange emission with a very low quantum yield and good transparency in the 400–800 nm range. Drastic photoluminescence switching via the crystal-glass transition is exploited for rewritable phase-change memory, as exemplified by a 4 × 4 array model device. The robust crystal–liquid–glass phase changes in hybrid metal halides and drastic photoluminescence switching open a new avenue to PCMs for further applications in remote information storage, sensing, and display.",

    "abstract": "Traditional environmental photonic sensing based on the balanced reflection of a photonic structure can hardly be applied to distinguish molecular size and homologues, since the refractive index change introduced by these analytes can be too similar to be unambiguously distinguished. Here, a sensing method based on the pore size selectivity and organics adsorption–desorption capacity of self-assembled ZIF-8 photonics crystal is demonstrated, which can tell apart different molecular sizes, homologues, and organics with similar structures and physical properties. Specificity is improved by the inherent relationships between the pore size of ZIF-8 metal–organic frameworks and the associated molecular diffusion rates in the pores, so that the combination of the observed peak shift and recovery time are unique to each analyte. Using this method, selective detection of molecular size is also demonstrated in the case of linear vs cyclic molecules, since only the former can penetrate inside the ZIF-8 pores to induce a large wavelength shift. The reflection peak shift caused by the linear molecules was found to be about 30–40 nm, an order of magnitude larger compared to those for the cyclic molecules. A relationship between the diffusion rate of linear molecules in ZIF-8 pore and the recovery time of photonic crystal reflective peak is further established, linking the recovery time and the linear molecular diffusion coefficient. Finally, different linear molecules are identified by their associated recovery time to detect homologues or organics with similar refractive index.",

The generated composite hydrogels exhibit excellent actuation performances in a 0 °C environment, thus demonstrating their enhanced robustness at low temperatures. Moreover, a light-controlled valve and bendable bilayer hydrogel actuator were produced, which demonstrated fast and reversible responses in water via photothermal contraction and expansion control.

    "abstract": "Hypoxia in tumor tissues is the major obstacle to photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, a self-oxygenating nanoplatform T4-Ce6-Cat (T4CCa) is used for improving PDT. T4 acts as a nanocarrier, with catalase (Cat) protein displayed on the capsid to trigger the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) degradation. The number of displayed Cats can be precisely controlled by the feed concentration. Chemically coupled chlorin e6 (Ce6) is a photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). By means of genetic engineering, phage display technology, and chemical modification, the T4CCa converts to \"super tumor phage\". The 852 Cat molecules, displayed on the phage surface, like a brush, increase the oxygen concentration to 21.7 mg/L in a short time (1 min), which effectively relieves tumor hypoxia. Adequate oxygen enables Ce6 to produce ROS effectively (93.6%), and the tumor inhibition rate reaches 86.07%. In vitro and in vivo toxicity assays reveal that T4CCa exhibits good biocompatibility at the molecular level, cellular level, and tissue organ level. More importantly, Cat still has a high catalytic capacity after T4CCa storage for a while. This work combines synthetic biology and nanotechnology to alleviate tumor hypoxia, providing a strategy for tumor treatment.",

    "abstract": "Management of hazardous waste is a pressing global concern, and the battle to ameliorate such waste is far from over, since it is continuously generated by the rapid growth of industrialization and the human population. Simultaneous capture of such hazardous waste and concurrent utilization in a sustainable energy application still remain the ultimate aspiration in the material field due to lack of appropriate methodology and materials from both water and the vapor phase. Herein, a new cost-effective and scalable route has been designed to synthesize a robust covalent organic framework (COF-TCO) that has been employed for iodine sequestration. The resulting adsorbent selectively captures over 98% of a trace amount of I3– from water with an excellent distribution coefficient (Kd ∼ 104 mL/g), revealing a strong affinity toward iodine. The high uptake capacity of 4.92 gg–1 was observed in the vapor phase, and efficient performance was achieved over a wide range of water systems, including potable water, lake water, river water, and seawater. Extensive experimentally guided computational studies revealed ultrahigh iodine selectivity brings out the attendant mechanistic understanding. Importantly, the iodine-captured COF-TCO was utilized for Li-ion battery applications, and it exhibited a modest specific capacity of 120 mAh/g, when tested against a lithium metal anode. The viability of scaling up lithium–iodine batteries for practical energy storage can be aided by hazardous and waste accumulated cathode materials combining safety and sustainability.",

These plastics are attracting attention in applications such as adhesives and carbon fiber composite materials. Vitrimers satisfy many of these requirements, in terms of reprocessability and self-healing. Herein, we report significant improvements in the properties of vitrimers induced by the ester-exchange reaction between polyester-grafted polyrotaxane (PR) and the ester bonds of epoxy resin vitrimer to achieve the uniform molecular dispersion of PR. The optimal epoxy resin vitrimer incorporated with PR (VPR) exhibited enhanced toughness, with an elongation at break 5.3 times greater than that of a vitrimer devoid of PR; it also showed self-healing properties, was chemically recycled 10 times faster, and was recovered twice as fast. These results can be ascribed to the sliding diffusion motion of the PR, which lowers the energy required for transesterification. Furthermore, VPR showed 25 wt % biodegradation following exposure to seawater for 30 days. These findings may lead to the development of environmentally friendly plastics that exhibit most of the properties required for a circular economy.",

    "abstract": "A set of two unique hybrid POPs (HPOP-1 and HPOP-2) bearing triptycene and phosphazene units has been developed for their use as strategic materials capable of sensing HCl acid vapor and capturing/storing iodine. The materials were synthesized via the well-known Schiff base reaction, leading to the inclusion of ample imine linkages in the resultant HPOPs that were characterized thoroughly using various techniques. High thermal stability of HPOPs was evident from the TGA plots. The protonation of phosphazene and imine moieties in HPOPs, upon exposure to corrosive HCl vapors, acts like a chemical trigger that could be perceived not only by a \"turn-on\" fluorescence response but also by a color change visible to the unaided (naked) eye. The optical and electronic response of the HPOPs in the presence of HCl vapors is fully reversible using NH3 vapors as a chemical switch. These HPOPs were also found to be suitable for trapping iodine vapors and iodine species present in water or hexane solutions. This additional utility of HPOPs arises due to the presence of ample N, O, and P heteroatoms and imine linkages in the polymeric network. HPOPs can trap up to 4.90 g g–1 of iodine at 75 °C. The iodine removal efficiency at ambient temperature (25 °C) under dry as well as humid conditions is also quite promising, and performances are better than that of previously reported porous materials under similar experimental conditions. HPOPs can also efficiently remove iodine dissolved in water and hexane. All of these results indicate that HPOP-1 and HPOP-2 are potential materials for versatile environmental applications.",

Inhibition of microglia/macrophages of M1 polarization using minocycline-based biomaterials efficiently reduces SCI of pro-inflammatory microenvironment. However, previously reported minocycline-loading biomaterials lack precise injured-microenvironment-responsive drug release behavior. Here the bisphosphonate (BP)–metal coordination method together with polymeric networks is used to deliver minocycline locally in SCI lesions, where the slight acid in the injured site triggers minocycline release. The data from in vitro cellular experiments and in vivo rat SCI model demonstrated that minocycline-loaded BP-based hydrogel (MH@BP Gel) availably inhibits microglia/macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype. Moreover, MH@BP Gel promotes animal motor functional recovery, inhibits glial scar formation, and promotes neurofilament- and class III β-tubulin-positive neuron survival and regeneration in vivo. Therefore, our presented MH@BP Gel provides a facile strategy for localized minocycline delivery and a promising solution for SCI therapy.",

However, for most TADF emitters, the upconversion processes from the lowest triplet state (T1) to the lowest singlet state (S1) are still inefficient due to the low RISC (kRISC) rate below 105 s–1. Herein, we report two TADF molecules, 2DACz-mCN and 2DACz-oCN, that possess multiple donor units to minimize singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) and enhance the spin–orbit coupling matrix elements. Our work shows that the rate constants of RISC of 2DACz-mCN and 2DACz-oCN are as fast as ∼2.7 × 106 and ∼8.6 × 106 s–1, which are 1 order of magnitude higher than the other benzonitrile-based TADF molecules. The short delayed fluorescent lifetimes of ∼1.58 and ∼1.16 μs in doped films are achieved. The OLEDs by utilizing 2DACz-oCN as emitter exhibit green electroluminescence (EL) with CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.28, 0.49) and high maximum quantum efficiency of ∼25.1% with the suppressed efficiency roll-off, which still remains ∼21% at the luminance of 1000 cd/m2.",

    "abstract": "The d0 transition metal oxides are the most commonly used nonlinear optical (NLO) materials in the visible light region; however, their limited band gaps seriously hinder their application in ultraviolet (UV) and deep-ultraviolet (DUV) regions. Achieving the double enhancement of band gap and birefringence by regulating anionic units helps to push their phase-matching (PM) wavelength into UV/DUV regions. Herein, starting from the famous NLO material LiNbO3, a \"dual-anion strategy\" is proposed to regulate the [NbO6–xFx] octahedra, and the predicted Li2Nb2O6–xF2x·(LiF)y (x = 1, 2, 4; y = 0, 2) materials exhibit the dual-property magnification of wide band gaps (3.82–6.26 eV, 1–3 eV larger than LiNbO3) and extraordinary birefringence (0.100–0.322, 1–4 times that of LiNbO3), along with a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 2.6–6.2 × KDP. Remarkably, Li2NbOF5-I and LiNbOF4-II have extremely short PM wavelength (λPM = 209 nm) ever reported for d0 transition metal oxyfluorides. Further analysis uncovers that the fluorinated modification of band edges and the increase of octahedral anisotropy in [NbO6−xFx] anionic groups are the main reasons for the enhanced PM ability.",

Our strategic approach involved the design of three soluble host materials (SiDBFDBA, SiDBTDBA, and SiPhCzDBA) by incorporating a 5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracene (DBA)-based electron acceptor unit, along with electron donor units, namely dibenzofuran (DBF), dibenzothiophene (DBT), and N-phenyl carbazole (PhCz). Notably, the introduction of DBF as an electron donor unit revealed suboptimal electron-donating characteristics, which prompted the incorporation of a p-type host material to achieve a high efficiency of 33.7 cd/A and 23.7%, which is one of the highest EQEs among phosphorescent red s-OLEDs reported. Conversely, DBT and PhCz exhibited enhanced electron-donating effects, which resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency roll-off. Understanding these characteristic distinctions and their correlation with roll-off behavior on the basis of device efficiency provides valuable insights for future directions in creating new hosts to enhance stability.",

    "abstract": "The local atomic structure in hematite determines its intrinsic property for photoelectrochemical water splitting, but its precise design has rarely been clearly demonstrated. Here by inserting Ge atoms into a hematite lattice with abundant vacancies, the local environment around Fe can be significantly modulated with the formation of a distorted Ge–O–Fe microstructure, which serves as an active catalytic unit to lower the energy barrier for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the optimized Ge–Fe2O3 (LV) photoanode exhibits an excellent photocurrent density of 4.04 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is 5.0 times higher than that of pristine Fe2O3 (0.80 mA/cm2). It can further achieve 5.09 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE (stable over 100 h) by coupling with FeNiOOH. Furthermore, when connecting the Ge-based hematite with a commercial solar cell, the all-solar-driven system can realize an outstanding solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 5.3%, standing for the top value for hematite-based systems. The Ge–O–Fe unit induced catalytic performance enhancement may shed light on the design of efficient catalysts for solar water splitting.",

    "abstract": "There has been a significant increase in the prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, resulting in a considerable decrease in the overall well-being for affected individuals. Moreover, the therapeutic effectiveness of CNS diseases is greatly impeded by the inability of the majority of small molecule drugs and almost all large molecule drugs to penetrate the brain barrier. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an efficient drug delivery system to effectively treat CNS disorders by transporting therapeutic agents to the CNS. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which are well-known for their efficient membrane penetration capabilities and their ability to facilitate the rapid passage of therapeutic drugs across the brain barrier, offer a potential strategy for the transportation of macromolecules across the brain barrier. This study has provided a comprehensive overview of the utilization of CPP-mediated therapeutic agents in the management of CNS diseases and summarized the recent advancements in clinic, aiming to establish a scientific foundation for the application of CPPs in the treatment of CNS diseases.",

The band-gap tunability of NPLs does not require halide composition engineering, so halide segregation can be avoided.

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of benzenesulfonate-terminated CsPbBr3 NPLs without the use of any amine, and we clarify their nucleation and growth mechanism. The thickness of amine-free NPLs is controlled with monolayer-level precision, and thus, their emission wavelength is tuned between 437 and 504 nm. Amine-free NPLs are solely terminated by a benzenesulfonate group, leading to a Cs-rich surface. The amine-free NPLs exhibit PLQYs up to 80%, and slow charge carrier relaxation. This work offers a comprehensive study of surface chemistry and ligand dynamics of perovskite NPLs.",

However, its weak killing effect on Gram-negative bacteria hinders its prospect for clinical application. To solve this problem, we modified lysozyme using a tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (TDN) to construct its complex (TDN-Lys). With the help of TDN, lysozyme showed a great bactericidal effect against both drug-resistant bacteria, MRSA, and Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli O157:H7. Morphological examination showed that TDN-Lys disrupted the external cell wall of bacteria more severely than did free lysozyme. Furthermore, TDN-Lys effectively healed MRSA-infected wounds in mice. Single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments revealed for the first time at the molecular level that TDN has a stronger affinity toward bacteria surface than lysozyme, which demonstrated that carriers or modified adjuvants with higher bacterial affinity can enhance lysozyme's antibacterial activity.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a new class of porous polymer materials, can be customized through specific ligand selection to tailor pore sizes and active sites, enabling them to selectively enrich and interact with targeted gas molecules, making them promising candidates for gas sensing. To advance their use in this field, it is essential to investigate the mechanisms of the complex interactions between COFs and target molecules as well as to improve COF film fabrication methods. This review outlines design strategies for COF films across multiscale: molecular interaction mechanisms, macroscopic interfacial synthesis methods, and microscale/nanoscale approaches such as double-layer films for filtration and micro/nanostructured films for improved gas transfer. Finally, several key research directions are proposed to improve the suitability of COF-based materials for gas sensing in complex environments.",

However, most of the reported materials only have a single adsorption function, which restricts their practical application for gold extraction from complex matrices. Herein, we construct a series of three-component covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with good antibacterial performance for the extraction of gold. All the obtained COFs show high adsorption capacities over 1250 mg·g–1 for gold, which may be attributed to the high specific surface area, regular pore structure and abundant binding sites. In particular, the optimized materials COF-TPTD-DHTA-TAB gives excellent adsorption capacity (2884 mg·g–1), ultrafast adsorption kinetics (60 min) and high distribution coefficient (Kd > 4 × 105 mL·g–1). More importantly, good sterilization performance is observed on both COF-TPTD-DHTA and COF-TPTD-DHTA-TAB under visible light irradiation.

In this vein, two asymmetric small molecule donors with thiophene/thiazolyl side chains and different end-groups of 3-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone (Reh) and cyanoacetic acid esters (CA), W2-CA and W2-Reh, were designed to gain insight into the combined effects of symmetry-breaking and end-group engineering.

The dissolution of transition metals in the cathode material is common in aqueous lithium batteries, leading to a rapid capacity deterioration. However, it is difficult to form an effective cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) layer in an aqueous electrolyte, even in a high-concentration \"water in salt\" aqueous electrolyte. Herein, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) based on N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC), LiClO4, and H2O is proposed as the high-concentrated electrolyte and diluted by nonsolvating 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) to obtain a locally concentrated DES aqueous electrolyte. The spectrum analysis and molecular dynamics calculations reveal the enhanced coordination bond strength of Li complexes upon TTE addition. The increased coordination reaction between Li+ and DMAC and the hydrogen bonding between DMAC and H2O profitably forms a robust and uniform CEI on a LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathode, resulting in a hybrid interface composed of a randomly LiF-distributed inner layer and organic outer layer reduced from solvent rather than anion, which can inhibit the Mn dissolution and promote stability of the LMO material effectively. The observation of how the coordination bond strength affects the formed CEI in aqueous electrolyte may provide an insight into more effective interphases of highly stable aqueous batteries.",

Complex approaches combined with different substances for PDT and GSH depletion brought potential toxic/side effects of metal ions or used unsustainable disulfide bonds. Therefore, a photosensitizer (PS) capable of continuously depleting GSH and keeping reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from falling simultaneously is still a challenge. Here, the newly designed Janus-PSs of TBBr and TBT addressed this challenge. They exhibited effective ROS generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH) and superoxide anion (O2•–) in normoxia or hypoxia upon light irradiation. More importantly, these Janus-PSs could continuously deplete GSH by directly utilizing it as an \"electron reservoir\" in the photoredox process of PDT to promote the O2•– generation, resulting in transforming GSH from an opponent to an ally for improving PDT performance. The Janus-PS of TBBr achieved a significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rate of 96.3% and a survival rate of 50% for mice even after a 60-day observation from in vivo experiments. Besides offering a novel approach to improve PDT performance, this work also provides new experimental insights into the photoredox mechanism of type-I PSs and potential contributions for PDT from substances in the cellular microenvironment.",

Our results identified Cu/Ti3C2O2-V0 and Ni/Ti3C2O2-Ti1 as promising SACs for the ultrahigh performance of NORR. Furthermore, NORR activity on both SACs diminished with the formation of the low-nuclearity cluster, especially for Ni clusters on Ti3C2O2-Ti1. From Ni single atoms to Ni clusters, the projected density of states increases significantly near the Fermi level, leading to stronger interactions between Ni clusters and reaction intermediates, thereby hindering hydrogenation steps and greatly slowing down the NORR on the Ni cluster. Meanwhile, a pH-dependent catalytic activity analysis revealed that the rate-determining step changed as the pH increased on Ni/Ti3C2O2-Ti1, and an acidic environment facilitates the effective NO-to-NH3 conversion on Cu/Ti3C2O2-V0. Therefore, this work not only predicts the highly efficient NORR catalyst but also reveals the weakening mechanism of low-nuclearity clusters that would guide future experimental research on SACs and metal clusters for NORR.",

    "abstract": "A photocatalytically active membrane, designed by embedding AgInS2 semiconductor nanoparticles and a Pt cocatalyst, facilitates a \"vectorial\" flow of photogenerated electrons and holes in opposite directions. The fabricated Pt–AgInS2–Nafion membrane, when inserted in an H-cell containing 50% ethanol (AgInS2 side) and water (pH = 4, Pt side), produced H2 under visible light irradiation. Photogenerated electrons reduced H+ at the Pt surface to produce H2, while oxidation of ethanol with holes at AgInS2 also produced H2. Back electron transfer at the Pt surface and surface defects within AgInS2 were responsible for the lower H2 yield in the reduction compartment. Remediation of the AgInS2 film with mercaptopropionic acid increased the yield 5–10 times by overcoming the loss of charge carriers at the defect sites. The feasibility of carrying out selective reduction and oxidation processes by directing the flow of charge carriers highlights the usefulness of photocatalytic membranes in solar fuel generation.",

Target miRNA-initiated strand displacement polymerization produces abundant DNA strands, which assist the assembly of the DNA hydrogel. The phase transition is successfully demonstrated by elastography and electrochemical techniques. The variation of flow distance is highly related to the viscosity of the DNA hydrogel. By visual observation of the distance, highly sensitive quantification of miRNA can be achieved. The limit of detection is estimated to be 1 fM, which is quite low. The utility in clinical samples is also verified by consistent results of the standard quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) technique. This approach is not only highly sensitive but also exhibits the merits of convenient operation and low cost, meeting the requirements of point-of-care testing. It shows significant potential for the applications of biological studies and clinical disease diagnosis.",

Here, we use natural SCS to prepare room-temperature phosphorescent materials by doping with luminescent difluoroboron β-diketonate (BF2bdk). SCS shells can provide a rigid environment for the BF2bdk triplet to suppress its nonradiative decay and oxygen quenching. In addition, room-temperature phosphorescent materials were prepared by improving leaves and processing raw silk as well as using natural products such as feathers and shells as matrices.

In this work, three different experimental methods were considered to recover a polyethylene (PE) resin from a printed multilayer film by STRAP. The methods consisted of (1) a filter bag system, (2) a Soxhlet extraction, and (3) a jacketed dissolution vessel. Cast films were produced with the PE recovered from each method and were analyzed for color, mechanical properties, and number of impurities. High-quality recycled PE cast films can be produced by increasing the solvent to plastic ratio, including a filter pore size of 100 μm, and optimizing temperature control in STRAP. This study demonstrates that STRAP polymers can be recycled back into plastic films, enabling the potential circularity of these packaging materials.",

Both copper NCs have an intrinsically chiral triple-stranded helicate metal core, unlike traditional copper NCs with a polyhedral-based kernel. The chiral structure of Cu15 resembles an enantiomeric pair in the unit cell. Moreover, Cu18 has a three-layered 3D chirality of a sandwich constructed of sulfur-bridged copper NCs aligned in a top-middle-down configuration. Furthermore, the Cu18 NC self-hierarchically assembles into a complex double-stranded helix secondary structure sustained by noncovalent interactions. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), density functional theory (DFT), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to validate the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) data.

Furthermore, the Li metal anode can remain stable for 1800 h even under commercial capacity of 5 mA cm–2 and 5 mA h cm–2. As a proof of concept, the LFP/GPE-PL/Li pouch cell exhibits superior performance evidenced by a long lifespan of 400 cycles at 1C.

We use first-principles defect calculations to mechanistically explain and quantify the increase/decrease in Na vacancy concentration due to aliovalent doping of Na3SbS4. By focusing on isovalent doping, we reveal local and global structural effects of doping on the migration barrier and, therefore, ion mobility. In conjunction with experiments, we demonstrate the interplay between the local and global effects. Doping with heavier anions to achieve more polarizable frameworks is a common approach to enhancing σion.

    "abstract": "Inspired by biological sensors that characteristically adapt to varying stimulus ranges, efficiently detecting stimulus changes sooner than the absolute stimulus values, we propose a mechanosensing concept in which the resolution can be adapted by magnetic field (H) gating to detect small pressure-changes under a wide range of compressive stimuli. This is realized with resistive sensing by pillared H-driven assemblies of soft ferromagnetic electrically conducting particles between planar electrodes under a voltage bias. By modulation of H, the pillars respond with mechanically adaptable sensitivity. Higher H enhances current resolution, while it increases scatter among repeating measurements due to increased magnetic structural jamming between colloids in their assembly. To manage the trade-off between electrical resolution and scatter, machine learning is introduced for searching optimum H gatings, thus facilitating efficient pressure prediction. This approach suggests bioinspired pathways for developing adaptive stimulus-responsive mechanosensors, detecting subtle changes across varying stimuli levels with enhanced effectiveness through machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Modulating the reaction reversibility can help escape kinetic traps and effectively regulate the morphology of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, most current approaches focus primarily on thermodynamic factors with limited research on enhancing kinetic reaction pathways. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy that combines a \"freezing–thawing\" pretreatment with conventional solvothermal synthesis to enhance kinetic pathways in COF-366 synthesis. This pretreatment effectively limits the degree of monomer polymerization, facilitating structural repairs during subsequent high-temperature reactions, and slows the polymerization rate, leading to a higher yield of kinetic products. Consequently, K-COF-366 synthesized through our kinetic-enhanced method exhibits hierarchically ordered nanosheet morphology, in contrast to the irregular agglomerates produced of T-COF-366 by traditional methods. These K-COF-366 nanosheets are well-suited for developing self-supported continuous membrane materials. They were obtained through vacuum-assisted filtration and functionally modified with pyruvic acid to create K-COF-366-COOH membranes, which demonstrate excellent separation performance for uranium and thorium.",

Yet, there is limited information regarding the chemical structure of the SAMs upon functionalization and subsequent thermal treatment. Here, we studied the on-surface reaction of carbazole-derived SAMs on model gold electrodes, focusing on the chemical structure changes induced by thermal treatments. Furthermore, we correlate the microscopic changes with their impact on the electrode's work function. The carbazole-based SAMs first transform into organometallic complexes. At higher annealing temperatures, SAMs convert to oligomeric complexes. The observed chemical reactions significantly reduce the electrode work function and facilitate electron injection in n-type organic thin-film transistors. Our results highlight the on-surface synthesis of electronically active SAMs as an alternative approach for modifying the work function of electrodes for organic electronics.",

Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFFs including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim, and OMat24, CHIPS-FF integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.",

In this study, two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical Fe–N–C materials were developed as highly active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Benefiting from the enhanced mesoporosity and two orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity, the as-obtained catalysts unify efficient mass transport and expedite charge transfer. Therefore, Zn-air battery integrated with this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh specific capacity of 798 mAh gZn–1 (close to theoretical value of 820 mAh gZn–1) and excellent durability for over 130 h.

    "abstract": "The choice of organic cation in hybrid perovskites has large implications for optoelectronic properties, material stability, and crystal structure. In particular, formamidinium ((CH(NH2)2+) perovskites exhibit unusual temperature-dependent trends in photoluminescence, dielectric constant, and phase behavior that are hypothesized to relate to CH(NH2)2+ reorientations. This contribution describes five distinct, temperature-dependent phase transitions in CH(NH2)2PbBr3 that produce changes in the steady-state photocurrent. Three of these phase transitions do not resolve crystallographically and relate to the orientation and dynamics of CH(NH2)2+. These crystallographically unresolvable phase transitions resemble ferroelastic transitions with the formation of nanoscale domains, which we hypothesize are mediated by the strain exerted from geometric frustration of CH(NH2)2+ quadrupoles. This work demonstrates the importance of cation orientation and dynamics, domain behavior, and their interdependence in the steady-state optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites.",

Subphthalocyanine has been recently emerging as an electron acceptor that has unique cone geometry, multiple functionalization, and broad absorption. Here, we designed and synthesized two fully conjugated rylene annulated subpthalocyanines (SubPcPDI3-Cl and SubPcPDI3-OC6H4tBu) bearing different axial substituents. Theoretical calculation revealed a cone-shaped and fully conjugated molecular geometry, and the dihedral angle between perylene diimide (PDI) wings and cone base is ∼25°. Both acceptors showed red-shifted absorbance at ∼680 nm and optical bandgaps of ∼1.70 eV, because of the π-electron conjugation of between the SubPc core and surrounded PDI wings. Thus, the broad absorption, aligned energy levels, and balanced hole/electron mobility ratio endow SubPcPDI3-Cl an excellent power conversion efficiency of 7.53% in non-fullerene solar cells, which presents the highest photovoltaic performance based on subphthalocyanines in solution-processed solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Discovery of structure–property interrelations in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is limited by the small number of high-performing semiconducting polymer families that are electrochemically active in aqueous media. Currently, state-of-the-art polymers often come with processability drawbacks; aqueous-processable polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) require insulating cross-linkers to protect against dissolution in aqueous electrolyte, while glycolated polymers frequently exhibit marginal solubility in both organic and aqueous solvents. Herein, we show that the carboxylic acid-functionalized conjugated polymer poly [3-(4-carboxypropyl)thiophene] (P3CPT) can be processed from a water-soluble precursor, yet requires no additives to yield solvent-resistant OECTs which exhibit electroactivity in aqueous and organic electrolytes. Devices fabricated with P3CPT exhibit unipolar p-channel operation in accumulation mode, with maximum transconductance of 26 ± 2 mS on interdigitated electrodes and competitive volumetric capacitance (C*) of 150 ± 18 F-cm–3, which rank amongst the highest for conjugated polymers with ionic side chain moieties. This work paves the way for future use of carboxylic acid functionalization to modify existing p- and n-channel backbones to yield highly competitive and processable OECT active materials.",

    "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical energy conversion, but the requirement of expensive Pt-based catalysts on the cathodes prevents its large-scale application. Herein, we report the preparation of three-dimensional carbon networks with atomically dispersed Fe–N4 active sites (SA-3DNC) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis in the cathodes of PEMFCs. Derived from NaCl-assisted pyrolysis, the SA-3DNC has a continuous, micro-macroporous hierarchical morphology which is endowed by the modulator effect of the molten salt. In 0.1 M HClO4, the SA-3DNC has a 0.906 V onset potential for ORR, which is 30 mV more positive than that of commercial 20% Pt/C. After 10 000 cycles of accelerated degradation, the half-wave potential of SA-3DNC only drops 38 mV, compared to 125 mV of the Pt/C. Furthermore, a single cell was assembled using the SA-3DNC as the cathodic catalyst, showing only a 20% current drop after a 20-h durability test at 0.5 V. Our study has demonstrated a facile way to prepare hierarchical, stable, and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed active sites for ORR catalysis in acidic media.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, metal halide perovskites have generated tremendous interest for optoelectronic applications and their underlying fundamental properties. Because of the large electron-phonon coupling characteristic of soft lattices, self-trapping phenomena are expected to dominate hybrid perovskite photoexcitation dynamics. Yet, while the photogeneration of small polarons was proven in low-dimensional perovskites, the nature of polaron excitations in technologically relevant 3D perovskites, and their influence on charge carrier transport, remain elusive. In this study, we used a combination of first principle calculations and advanced spectroscopy techniques spanning the entire optical frequency range to pin down polaron features in three-dimensional metal halide perovskites. Mid-infrared photoinduced absorption shows the photogeneration of states associated with low energy intragap electronic transitions with lifetime up to the millisecond time scale, and vibrational mode renormalization in both frequency and amplitude. Density functional theory supports the assignment of the spectroscopic features to large polarons leading to new intragap transitions, hardening of phonon mode frequency, and renormalization of the oscillator strength. Theory provides quantitative estimation for the charge carrier masses and mobilities increase upon polaron formation, confirming experimental results. Overall, this work contributes to complete the scenario of elementary photoexcitations in metal halide perovskites and highlights the importance of polaronic transport in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.",

Here, we achieved a high fluorescence anisotropy value of 0.4 in the mixed-anion lead halide perovskite NRs, which constitutes a four-fold enhancement as compared to pristine CsPbBr3 NRs. This was realized by substituting some smaller bromine anions with larger iodine anions in the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 NRs via anion exchange. The resulting CsPbBr1.2I1.8 NRs kept a highly uniform length of ∼36 nm and width of ∼8.6 nm, and possessed a high emission quantum yield of 83%. On the basis of the DFT calculations, we attribute the improved polarized emission of the mixed-anion perovskite NRs to a moderate structural distortion of PbX6 octahedra units in the orthorhombic perovskite lattice, which results in a preferred direction of the optical transition dipole moment along the Pb–X–Pb axis. Our study provides a guidance for design and fabrication of perovskite NRs with high fluorescence anisotropy.",

However, sensor performance variations under varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, are common in piezoresistive sensors because of their intrinsic materials properties. Moreover, the viscoelasticity of soft elastomers causes strain response in a time-dependent fashion, which poses sensor limitations in high-frequency tactile tasks, such as texture recognition. In this work, we demonstrate a new environment-robust tactile sensor via an interfacial engineering process for uniform graphene coating on microstructured elastomers. The sensor enables reliable pressure response over a range of temperature (25–60 °C) and humidity (30–90% relative humidity) conditions, with resistance variations less than 5% and 3%, respectively. It is also able to detect vibrations with frequency up to 1500 Hz. Moreover, our sensor shows ultra-high durability, with high sensitivity and low hysteresis preserved after 1 million cycles. We demonstrate applications with the sensor in epidermal signal monitoring at different arteries, as well as accurate (>95%) surface texture recognition in combination with machine learning.",

Here, we highlighted an electronic structure engineering on Cu-based catalyst with atomically dispersed Cu–N3S1 active sites, representing as highly active electrode material for oxygen reduction. The structurally-new Cu–N3S1 species shows unique electron interactions with both phosphorus atoms/carbon support, which not only activate the electron transfer around the Cu–N3S1 sites but also enhance the interaction with oxygenated species, resulting in a promoting reaction kinetics process. As expected, this catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution.

Specifically, this strategy is general and can be extended to other metal single atom catalyst systems (such as Fe–N3S1 species).

Conjugated polyelectrolytes with different substituent groups (−F, −CN) were designed and synthesized. Compared to the unmodified polymer, the −F and −CN modified polymers showed 2.9- and 12-times improvements in the hydrogen evolution rate (3 μmol h–1 vs 8.8 μmol h–1 vs 38.3 μmol h–1). Notably, −CN substituents in the polymer could reduce the exciton binding energy, induce closer packing and higher crystallinity, improve the charge transporting, and reduce the charge recombination. Moreover, higher efficient exciton generation and charge transfer efficiency to cocatalysts were observed in −CN modified polymers, indicating the great promise of using substituent regulation to achieve high-performance organic photocatalysts.",

For samples with thick shells, the copper-based photoluminescence quantum yield reached over 60%, a record value for doped InP NCs.

The influence of the microscale concave interface geometry and refractive index contrast on the structural colors produced is systematically investigated, and the results are compared with those predicted by optical modeling.

However, the controlled synthesis of pomegranate-like nanostructured materials remains challenging due to their complicated construction. Here, we develop a versatile synthetic approach to fabricate pomegranate-like transition-metal phosphides encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (TMP@N–Cs) through a direct vapor-phase leaching reduction of polydopamine (PDA)-coated transition-metal phosphates (TMPO@PDA). The distinctive TMP@N–C nanostructure has superior features for their applications in energy storage. For example, pomegranate-like Co2P@N–C when explored as anodes for Li-ion battery, possess faster Li-ion transport kinetics and improved electrical conductivity, demonstrating superior rate capability (discharge capacity of 412 mAh g–1 at a high current density 5 A g–1) and long cycle life (very stable capacity of 632 mAh g–1 over 300 cycles).",

Heterogeneous cocrystallization has recently emerged as a new \"growth point\" in nanocluster science.

The structure may be viewed as crystallization-induced self-organization of DB18C6 molecules into cage-like hexamers in the interstitial spaces of the lattice of trigonal Ag29 (Ag29T) clusters, which resulted in an anisotropic expansion of the Ag29T lattice along its z-axis. This structure corresponds to a new family of \"lattice inclusion\" compounds in nanoclusters. Supramolecular forces guide the assembly of the clusters and the crown ethers, which pack into complex hierarchical patterns in their crystal lattice. We identified the effect of such a coassembly on the solid-state luminescence of the cluster. The crystals containing the coassembly were ∼3.5-fold more luminescent than the parent Ag29T crystals. We also used high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to get further insights into the nature of the complexation between Ag29 cluster and DB18C6.

In this work, we report halide perovskite-based FET operation at room temperature with negligible hysteresis. Extensive measurements and device modeling reveal that incorporating high-k dielectrics enables modulation of the channel conductance. Furthermore, continuous bias cycling or resting allows dynamical reconfiguration of the FETs between p-type behavior and ambipolar FET with balanced electron and hole transport and an ON/OFF ratio up to 104 and negligible degradation in transport characteristics over 100 cycles. These results elucidate the path for achieving gate modulation in perovskite thin films and provide a platform to understand the interplay between the perovskite structure and external stimuli such as photons, fields, and functional substrates, which will lead to novel and emergent properties.",

Specific molecules include p-IO1, o-IO1, p-IO2, and o-IO2 with optical bandgaps of 1.34, 1.28, 1.24, and 1.20 eV, respectively. Manipulating the optoelectronic properties and intermolecular organization by substituting bulky phenylhexyl (p-) for linear octyl chains (o-) and replacing bisalkoxy (-O2) with alkyl-alkoxy combination (-O1) allows one to target energy bandgaps and achieve a favorable bulk heterojunction morphology when in the presence of the donor polymer PTB7-Th. Solar cells based on o-IO1 and PTB7-Th exhibit an optimal power conversion efficiency of 13.1%. The excellent photovoltaic performance obtained with the o-IO1 acceptor can be attributed to a short-circuit current of 26.3 mA cm–2 and energy losses on the order of 0.54 eV. These results further highlight how side-chain engineering is a straightforward strategy to tune the molecular design of n-type molecular semiconductors, particularly in the context of NIR high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.",

However, some 2D amorphous metal oxide nanosheets produced by strong acid weak alkali salts (such as FeCl3, ZrCl4, CrCl3, SnCl4, and AlCl3) are difficult to synthesize, because of their tendency to precipitate and aggregate under facile conditions. Thus, developing a common route to prepare these 2D amorphous metal oxide nanosheets is urgently needed. Herein, we report a universal method to synthesize a series of 2D amorphous metal oxide, including Fe2O3, Cr2O3, ZrO2, SnO2, and Al2O3. In this method, lamellar oleate is introduced as a host matrice to restrict the ion exchange reaction that occurs between Cu2O and metal ions. By controlling calcination temperature to remove the oleate, the corresponding 2D amorphous metal oxide ultrathin nanosheets are successfully obtained. This facial method may open a new avenue to fabricate promising 2D amorphous metal oxide nanosheets for practical applications.",

Nevertheless, available reports mostly rely on the solvent-based routes, typically altered from processes for powder synthesis which are obstacles to the nanofabrication. Besides, although few vapor-phase growth approaches were presented, the proposed procedures required multiple steps, such as matrix deposition and post-conversion, to obtain desired MOF films on substrates. Here, we demonstrate a steam-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to directly synthesize highly crystalline ZIF-67 thin films at the temperature <125°C. With a slow deposition rate, the ZIF-67 forms a highly oriented thin film on a c-plane sapphire substrate, indicating the growth is epitaxial. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of directly grown CVD ZIF-67 as the active material of chemiresistors onto microelectronic chips. The ZIF-67 chemiresistors exhibit responses to the gas molecules, which are capable of diffusing into the cage of ZIF-67 at room temperature. The proposed synthesis method of ZIF-67 thin films is simple, scalable, cost-effective, and promising for numerous applications.",

The SMSP was endowed with remarkable shape memory performance and solvent resistance owing to its covalent cross-linking. It displayed outstanding shape memory cycle stability with above 92.7% of shape recovery ratio even after 20 consecutive shape memory cycles. In addition, SMSP could be recycled for 7 times without clear decline in mechanical properties, exhibiting excellent multiple reprocessability.

This communication proves that this is not always true by considering NUS-8/PIM-1, a prototypical MMM for CO2 capture. Our molecular simulations approach integrating quantum calculations, force field-based Monte Carlo, and equilibrium/non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, revealed that a porosity generated at the NUS-8/PIM-1 interface in the form of microvoids favors the interactions between CO2 and the NUS-8 surface and therefore contributes to ensure a high CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity for the corresponding MMM, preserving the pure NUS-8 membrane value and exhibiting a high flux for CO2. This high-level performance is achieved by means of a solubility-driven separation mechanism, as opposed to previously studied diffusion-driven separations where the interface porosity had been shown to deteriorate the MMM separation performance. We believe that these results will change the current paradigm in the field of MOF/polymer MMMs, paving the way toward new strategies for the development of highly efficient membranes for gas separation.",

In this study, we investigated another promising member of the MXene family, Nb4C3Tx, and found that it also has a very high breakdown current density of ∼1.1 × 108 A cm–2, which is comparable to that of Ti3C2Tx and other highly conductive two-dimensional materials, such as graphene. The measurements were performed on electronic devices based on individual monolayer flakes of Nb4C3Tx, which were tested at gradually increasing voltages until the electrical breakdown was observed. The morphology of Nb4C3Tx devices after the breakdown was studied by microscopic techniques. The high breakdown current densities of Ti3C2Tx and Nb4C3Tx suggest that other members of the large MXene family likely possess this property and could be employed in applications utilizing their high current-carrying capacity.",

    "abstract": "Mining lithium from the ocean has long been impeded by the lack of suitable lithium extracting technology. So far, adsorption and electrochemical strategies have been investigated. However, application of the adsorption method was limited by low adsorption rate and dissolution of adsorbent. In addition, experiments using the electrochemical method were either confined to lithium-enriched brine or performed in static electrochemical cell, which requires replacement of electrode. Herein, we report a fluidic electrochemical extraction (FEE) route for lithium extraction from seawater. This FEE system consists of an oxygen evolution cathode, a MnO2 working electrode, and an oxygen reduction anode. In operation, a voltage was applied on the cells to force Li+ to enter into MnO2 and release it as LiOH raw material. By virtue of the flow architecture, we have successfully extracted lithium from seawater with 7.0 ppm Li+. The highest absorption capacity reaches up to 20.6 mg Li+ per 1.0 g MnO2 for 0.8 h, corresponding to an electrical energy consumption of 7.2 Wh for extracting 1.0 g Li+. The fluidic electrochemical strategy developed in this study provides a remarkably effective method for lithium extraction from seawater and can be extended to extract other metal ions from the ocean or even in other fluids.",

    "abstract": "Anisotropy in low-dimensional materials offers an extra degree of freedom to understand and tune the peculiar or potential properties to design novel electronic, optical, thermal, and optoelectronic devices. However, most research attention has been paid to qualitatively observing anisotropic phenomena, lacking quantitatively revealing optical anisotropy, in particular, and deeply digging for the physical mechanism. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, the complete dielectric tensor of quasi-one-dimensional ZrTe5 is determined by Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) to quantitatively and comprehensively investigate the giant optical anisotropy, and the underlying physical mechanism is revealed by combination with the first-principle calculations. The ZrTe5 demonstrates giant dispersive birefringence and dichroism, and the birefringence (Δn = 0.58) outperforms many other low-dimensional and conventional birefringent materials, showing great potential and advantages in fabricating miniature and integrated polarization-sensitive devices. By combining the critical point (CP) analysis and first-principle calculations, the specific interband transitions related to the CPs in dielectric function spectra along three crystal axes of ZrTe5 are identified, revealing the physical essence of the optical anisotropy from the perspective of quantum mechanics. The proposed method is general and can be easily extended to quantitatively investigate the optical anisotropies in other novel low-symmetry materials.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (such as methylammonium lead triiodide, MAPbI3) in photoelectric applications has prompted investigations of novel strategies to improve photodetection performance. Although a few surface nanofabrication methods have been applied to texture perovskite thin films to enhance light trapping, it remains challenging to pattern large-area periodic perovskite nanoarrays in a tunable and scalable manner. In this work, we report a facile and low-cost approach to fabricate large-area SiO2/Si nanopyramids arrays through nanosphere lithography. These nanopyramids arrays are used to pattern MAPbI3 thin films. We find that the introduction of nanopyramid arrays enhances the light intensity within the perovskite film, which is confirmed by light absorption tests and optical simulations. As a result, the photodetectors based on MAPbI3 with nanopyramid structures show excellent responsivity of 28.8 ± 1.0 A/W and detectivity of (3.5 ± 0.1) × 1011 Jones at 650 nm. The photoresponse of the photodetector to pulsed light is highly stable and reproducible, with rise and decay times of ∼0.7 and 1.1 ms, respectively. They also have a broader light sensitivity range from ultraviolet to infrared light, i.e., 340 nm to 1100 nm, compared to those without nanostructures. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype image sensor using these photodetector arrays.",

Under laser irradiation, the MOF@TiO2 PS generates singlet oxygen (1O2) through an oxygen-dependent type II mechanism by energy transfer. Notably, it is also able to produce superoxide radicals (O2• –) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) via oxygen-independent type I mechanism by electron transfer under severely hypoxic conditions because of the staggering energy band edges between TCPP and TiO2. Thus, the advanced nanosystems can self-regulate to maximize PDT performance based on competition between Type I and Type II against in vivo hypoxic solid tumors. This work pioneers a new strategy to implement type I PDT against solid hypoxic tumors using engineered MOFs.",

    "abstract": "Bismuth oxide is one of the best-known formate production catalysts from electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. It came as a surprise here that its hybridization with CeOx drastically boosted the catalytic activity and stability on CO2 reduction toward formate formation. Specifically, the formate faradaic efficiency of Bi2O3–CeOx exceeds 85% starting from −0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and remains above 90% from −0.5 V to −1.1 V vs RHE, outperforming the pure Bi2O3 and most other reported formate catalysts. Experimental and computational results suggest that the significantly enhanced catalytic activity arises from the electronic synergy between Bi2O3 and CeOx. The electronic synergy results in abundant defects in CeOx favorable for CO2 activation and adsorption. Moreover, CeOx promotes water dissociation to form H* but with a large energy barrier to H2, which can easily react with CO2 and accelerate the rate-determining step of hydrogenation step. The generality of the CeOx-promoted catalysis for CO2 reduction to formate is also demonstrated for In2O3. This work opens up a new avenue for the design of efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.",

However, most high-mobility semiconducting polymers suffer from poor stretchability and strain-dependent charge carrier mobility. Herein, we report an approach to improve the stretchability of semiconducting polymers while maintaining charge carrier mobility. The strain independent performance was accomplished by incorporating a nontoxic small molecule, namely triacetin (TA), into high-mobility conjugated polymers. We observed that TA molecules substantially increased the stretchability of the high-mobility semiconducting polymer diketopyrrolopyrrole-thienyl-vinyl-thiophene (DPP-TVT), with a crack onset strain >100%, while the neat DPP-TVT polymer only shows a low crack onset strain <25%. The organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices fabricated using the TA blend films maintain similar charge carrier mobility compared to the neat DPP-TVT-based devices. The influences of TA additive were further characterized, which included reduced glass transition temperature of polymer backbones, decreased modulus, and breakage of the polymer chain aggregations. The TA additive functions as a plasticizer residing in between lamellae layers of semiconducting polymers, which helps to preserve the crystalline molecular packing under deformation. We demonstrated the applicability of this approach by improving the stretchability of various semiconducting polymers using TA and its analog tricaproin. Last, a stretchable OFET array was fabricated with TA blended films, and it showed a well-maintained charge carrier mobility even after 1000 stretch–release cycles at 50% strain.",

Here, we report a significant improvement in the device thermal stability and operational lifetime of blue-fluorescent OLEDs by adopting a mixed electron transporting layer (mETL) of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen) and hydroxyquinolinolato-lithium (Liq). Compared to pristine BPhen film, Liq mixing improved thermal and morphological stabilities of the mETL by increasing the glass-transition temperature and inhibiting crystallization of the ETL, which directly leads to better device performances. Compared to the reference device using the pristine BPhen film as an ETL, the device with mETL containing 50% Liq maintains the device characteristics, with respect to the thermal stress up to 110 °C, which is a 60 °C increase in the thermal stability of the blue device by applying mETL. Accordingly, the operational lifetime of the device with mETL containing 50% Liq is substantially extended by 67 times, ensuring that this remarkable device lifetime enhancement is dominantly driven by the improved thermal and morphological stabilities of mETL.",

    "abstract": "It is a significant challenge to achieve a high photoluminescence quantum yield of Cu(I) complexes, particularly for red Cu(I) emitters, because of their considerable reorganization energy and weak spin–orbit coupling. Herein, we report a red phosphorescent cyclic trinuclear Cu(I) complex (denoted as 1), which was formed by reacting alkyl-substituted pyrazole ligands (4-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole) with in situ generated Cu(I) ions. Complex 1 was nonemissive in a pure tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, whereas it emitted intense red light when its molecules were aggregated by adding water to the THF solution. Near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields were achieved in a mixed solvent of THF/water (fe = volwater/volwater+THF, fe = 90%), poly(methyl methacrylate) films, and in the solid state. Photophysical analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that the excellent photoluminescence performance was due to the aggregation-enhanced emission. In the aggregation state, cuprophilic interactions dominated the excited state, and the restricted movement of alkyl through CH···C/CH···π interactions diminished nonradiative transition. A cyclic trinuclear Cu(I) complex was used to fabricate a nondoped organic light-emitting diode (OLED), which is the first instance of such Cu(I) materials.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of organic dyes is an effective way to achieve novel properties that are drastically distinctive from those of monomers. However, achieving well-organized nanostructures through controllable assembly with desired performance remains a challenge. Herein, we present the first example of modulation of singlet oxygen generation through controlling the self-assembly behaviors of heavy-atom-free BODIPY derivatives (1–4) by incorporating different TEG chains on the BODIPY core. Different assembly behaviors remarkably alter the structures and ISC efficiencies of the nanoassemblies, thus leading to a remarkable distinction in singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest these different behaviors are attributed to their different molecular stacking modes, which affect the energy splitting of optically allowed transitions. Significantly, the 1O2 generation rate of assembly 1 is 13.4-fold higher than that of iodo-BODIPY (a traditional heavy-atom effect based photosensitizer), which allows application for photodynamic therapy with excellent phototherapeutic efficacy. This work not only deepens the understanding of the self-assembly effects of organic dyes on the ISC process but also provides a feasible strategy to construct materials with tunable ISC rates through rational selection of the assembly of dyes instead of molecule design and synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Thermal interface materials (TIMs) that function as reducing the contact thermal resistance between chip and cooling solution are indispensable in modern electronics. The development of electronics toward reduced feature size and being wearable has led to the need for new TIMs with both heat dissipation and high energy dissipation. However, the strong coupling between storage modulus and energy dissipation makes it difficult for TIMs to acquire these two properties simultaneously. Here, we propose an anneal-induced disentanglement strategy to obtain excellent heat dissipation properties of TIMs in a vibration environment, which is difficult for traditional TIMs. The dissociation of partially introduced dynamic covalent bonds in the polymer matrix releases the trapped entanglement and reduces storage modulus during the annealing process. Using prototypical dynamic thioester cross-linked polybutadiene adducted with maleic anhydride (PAMA), we achieved thioester-TIMs with tan δ higher than 0.94 in the frequency range of daily life, which is 4.7 times higher than that of traditional TIMs. In the actual application of 10 Hz vibration frequency, no temperature fluctuations (∼0 °C) are detected when using the thioester-TIMs chips, while the use of traditional TIMs show fluctuations of ∼3 °C. Such excellent performance creates new opportunities for TIMs design, and addresses current limitations in TIMs for flexible electronic packaging.",

This study reports the development of an ionotronic skin-based humanoid robot hand that can recognize objects precisely through finger tapping or touching. The ionotronic skin is composed of a cytoskeleton-like filament network structure and possesses mechanical properties highly akin to human skins, including softness (Young's modulus of 51 ± 15 MPa), toughness (1.6 ± 0.7 MJ m–3), and antifatigue-fracture ability. In addition, the i-skin functions as a triboelectric nanogenerator with the ability to perceive the triboelectric signals of an object when in contact with it. By combining triboelectric sensing information, machine learning, and Internet of Things techniques, the humanoid robot hand can accurately recognize different materials among a diverse set of spherical objects and further deliver them to the designated location. The high sorting success rate of 97.2% in 600 tests of recognizing five types of spherical objects, together with the outstanding mechanical and environmental tolerance, allow such humanoid robot hands to be used for intelligent sorting, automatic operation, and assembly in unmanned factories, as well as for the classification of garbage and hazardous materials.",

The polymerization of ether-based monomers enables the transport of Li+ as a solid-state electrolyte, and the ceramic membrane constructed by ceramic nanowires serves to prevent short-circuiting of the cell, inhibit crystallization of the polymer, and build fast ion channels at the interface of the polymer and nanowires. The CSE has a tunable room-temperature ionic conductivity (10–3–10–5 S cm–1), lithium-ion transference number (0.36–0.54), and electrochemcial window (4.3–5.18 V) based on monomer conversion. Owing to the low interfacial resistance of in situ polymerization, the assembled solid-state LMBs have good cycling and rate performance.

    "abstract": "Perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells have recently exceeded the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite solar cells. They are typically built in the superstrate configuration, in which the device is illuminated from the substrate side. This limits the fabrication of the solar cell to transparent substrates, typically glass coated with a transparent conductive oxide (TCO), and adds constraints because the first subcell that is deposited on the substrate must contain the wide-bandgap perovskite. However, devices in the substrate configuration could potentially be fabricated on a large variety of opaque and inexpensive substrates, such as plastic and metal foils. Importantly, in the substrate configuration the narrow-bandgap subcell is deposited first, which allows for more freedom in the device design. In this work, we report perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells fabricated in the substrate configuration. As the substrate we use TCO-coated glass on which a solution-processed narrow-bandgap perovskite solar cell is deposited. All of the other layers are then processed using vacuum sublimation, starting with the charge recombination layers, then the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell, and finishing with the transparent top TCO electrode. Proof-of-concept tandem solar cells show a maximum PCE of 20%, which is still moderate compared to those of best-in-class devices realized in the superstrate configuration yet higher than those of the corresponding single-junction devices in the substrate configuration. As both the top and bottom electrodes are semitransparent, these devices also have the potential to be used as bifacial tandem solar cells.",

As a result, we successfully visualized important mechanical evolution on the cross-section of μSi anode such as initial pulverization, onset of particle crack formation and its patterns, irreversible volumetric changes, fresh solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation at cracked surfaces, and particle isolations. In addition, we revealed via in situ AFM that limiting the upper cutoff voltage (e.g., <0.7 VvsLi) can suppress the mechanical failure of a μSi anode and subsequently improve capacity retention with a reduced cell impedance. These results demonstrated the potential of the proposed in situ AFM as a powerful technique that can identify electrochemical–mechanical behaviors of various energy-storage materials at the \"real-world\" electrode level.",

Introducing anchoring materials that can promote Al2Sn conversion is an effective way to solve this problem. However, the lack of an interaction mechanism between Al2Sn and anchoring materials hinders the design of anchoring materials. Here, we used single-atom-loaded MXene (SA@MXene) as a representative anchoring material to systematically investigate the binding strength between SA@MXene and Al2Sn, the sulfur reduction process on MXene, and their geometric configurations, stabilities, and electronic structures. We evaluated the reaction activity of the various SA@MXene nanosheets and discovered four high-performance cathode candidates for Al–S batteries (SA = Y, Nb, Mo, Tc) with a minimum reaction energy barrier of 0.23 eV. Importantly, to unravel the interaction mechanism between Al2Sn and the anchoring material, we proposed an activity volcano by consolidating the decisive S8*, Al2S8*, and Al2S12* binding strengths, which provides a significant roadmap for designing cathodes for Al–S batteries. The proposed study of the Al–S conversion process will benefit the understanding of sulfur chemistry and provide valuable inspiration for the design of other catalytic reaction processes.",

The solution processability of the NCs and their small size enabled the fabrication of transparent and flexible NC-polymer composite films, which we were fashioned into X-ray imaging scintillators. These scintillators exhibit excellent performance with a high X-ray imaging resolution of 20 lp/mm, and a relatively low detection limit of 720 nGy/s.

    "abstract": "Stretching of conductive polymer composite (CPC) foams always results in a severe reduction in electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) mainly due to the destruction of conductive networks and the decrement of sample thickness. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a novel strategy for preparing CPC foams with strain-stable EMI SE under moderate stretching. Herein, a strategy of constructing an auxetic structure to stabilize the EMI SE of CPC foams during stretching is proposed for the first time. Lightweight auxetic polyurethane/carbon nanotube (APU/CNT) composite foams were prepared by a solution dip-coating approach and triaxial volumetric compression. Compared with nonauxetic PU/CNT foam, the APU/CNT foam with similar filler loading and density of around 0.035 g/cm3 showed more stable SE values with the increase of tensile strain (especially within the first 20% strain, the SE/SE0 reduction of the APU/CNT foam is less than ∼5%), exhibiting enhanced strain-stable EMI-shielding behavior in the stretching process. The underlying reason is that the presence of auxetic structure with a negative Poisson's ratio could not only slightly increase the thickness of the foam but also avoid the serious destruction of the conductive networks under stretching, which is beneficial to attenuate EM waves more stably. Moreover, the outstanding and more stable Joule-heating performance could also be observed in the stretched APU/CNT foam. This work reveals the potential of auxetic structures to solve the challenging problem of how to stabilize the EMI-shielding (or Joule-heating) performance of CPC foams during moderate stretching.",

    "abstract": "Short-wave infrared (SWIR) light is suitable for image recognition and biomedical applications due to the ability to perform unique absorption of material components. In this study, the partial inversion of a spinel structure was modified through cation substitution to induce an inverse behavior and charge variation. For MgGa2O4, the substitution of Ga3+ with Sn4+ expanded lattice parameters (a, b, c, and V), and Mg2+ was used to achieve charge balance. When the concentration of Sn increased, the T2g vibrational mode exhibited a significant decline at 638 cm–1, which was ascribed to GaO4, and another retentive T2g vibrational mode at 542 cm–1 was ascribed to MgO4. This demonstrated that MgGa2O4 was a local structure with partial inversion. The clusters of (Ga/MgO4–MgO4) from y = 0.5 to 0.7 revealed a disordered broadband signal in the same Raman shift, and octahedral sites retained their ordering structure. The local structure induced Ni2+/3+ to coexist and transform into pure Ni2+ at octahedral sites through increasing Sn concentration. The time-resolved photoluminescence and emission spectrum revealed high energy transfer efficiency (>90%). The long SWIR emission achieved through Sn substitution enabled the fabrication of an SWIR light-emitting diode device; this device, along with a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, increased the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based image recognition system from 72.2% to 94.4%. This study promotes research on sequences for inverse tetrahedral sites such as Mg, Al, Ga, In, and other transition metals in spinel structures. In addition, the applicability of artificial intelligence to complete everyday tasks was demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Amplifying the photoluminescence of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles by antenna materials can bridge the gap in properties between pristine nanoparticles and those required by practical applications. However, high-performance antennas with ideal stability are rather few. Here, we report a new type of iridium (Ir)-based phosphonate complex as an antenna to amplify the near-infrared luminescence of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles. Unlike conventional antennas, the Ir complex, with a quasi-spherical structure and pendent phosphonic groups, can resist the aggregation-caused quenching and firmly anchor on nanoparticles. Near-infrared luminescence of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles can be stably amplified up to 130 times by the complex, which should be due to short-range energy transfer from the triplet state of the complex to lanthanide ions. These findings may pave a new fundamental way to amplify the luminescence of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles and promote applications of the nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "An advanced synchrotron-based in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique is successfully developed and employed to track and monitor the formation and phase selection of cobalt (Co) in electrodeposition in real time and verify DFT computational results. The impacts of a number of controlling factors including the pH of the electrolyte and deposition overpotential are systematically studied. The results show that the yielded phase of the electrodeposited Co is controlled by both thermodynamics and kinetics. The low pH low overpotential condition favors the formation of the thermodynamically stable fcc phase. While the high pH high overpotential condition promotes the formation of the metastable hcp phase. The experimental results agree well with the nanometric phase diagram computed with DFT. Layer-by-layer alternative stacking of fcc-hcp polymorphic phases can be facilely fabricated by just varying the overpotential. This work not only offers an effective means to control the phase of electroplating of Co but also presents a new approach to reveal the fundamental insights of the formation of metals under electrochemical reduction driving force.",

However, the poor understanding of the reaction between bromine-based perovskites and ZnO films hinders the preparation of high-quality bromine-based perovskites on ZnO films. Here, we demonstrate an in situ interfacial amidation reaction between one amino group of formamidinium bromide (FABr) and sol–gel ZnO film, leaving unreacted amino groups to form an amino-rich ZnO/perovskite interface. The density of amino groups, which can regulate the crystallization of FAPbBr3, is determined by the original carboxylate groups of the ZnO film. Carboxylate groups-rich zinc–magnesium oxide film is further developed to grow high-quality FAPbBr3 crystals. The resultant inverted PeLEDs show a low turn-on voltage of 1.8 V and a peak external quantum efficiency of 12.7%, the highest efficiency reported for green-emissive PeLEDs prepared directly on ZnO-based films. This significant discovery provides a promising route toward achieving high-performance inverted bromine-based PeLEDs on oxide ETLs.",

As such, fabricating large-area quasi-2D perovskite solar cells (PCSs) with high power conversion remains under active exploration. We identified that maintaining the homogeneous crystalline orientation upon scaling up is a key challenge. Thus, we introduce a thiophene-based polyelectrolyte as the hole transporting layer (HTL) to facilitate large area quasi-2D PCSs fabrication with high performance. The HTL with carboxyl acid anchoring groups can be attached to various conducting metal oxide substrates, enabling a conformal self-assembled monolayer (SAM). This SAM surface facilitates the quasi-2D perovskite crystal growth vertically aligned to the substrate. Along with a favorable energy alignment, a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.24 V was achieved, approaching the Shockley-Queisser optimal limit (VOC = 1.34 V). Remarkably, the device maintained over 80% of its initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under simulated AM1.5G solar irradiation for 1000 h at a relative humidity of 60%. These findings offer new fabrication strategies, paving the way to scalable quasi-2D PCS production with high efficiencies.",

Here, we report an anthracene-based crystallization chaperone TMAPA to overcome the above limitation, where 56 various oily organic guest molecules were co-crystallized with TMAPA in the organic solvent. As a result, 51 high-resolution co-crystal structures of organic guest molecules (chiral or achiral) with TMAPA were determined in a short time so that 51 refined structures of oily organic guest molecules can be readily determined. Importantly, anthracene moieties introduced in the TMAPA structure could not only extend the length of arms to increase the size of pores but also adaptively adopt different conformations leading to an efficient capture of the guest molecule during the co-crystallization process. It is expected that this work will open up new possibilities for structural identification and absolute conformation determination of unknown oily organic molecules.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing sustainable and convenient energy from the environment via triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to achieve photoinduced organic conversion was an effective but challenging strategy. Herein, we addressed this challenge by introducing coordination polymers (CPs) into the TENG for output regulation. A two-dimensional cadmium coordination polymer (Cd-CP) was synthesized and used as the triboelectric layer for fabricating TENGs. Due to its well-defined platform as well as consistent and precise structure, the output of the Cd-CP-based TENG was superior to that of the ligand-based TENG. To clearly illustrate the influence of the doping ratios of Cd-CP in organic polymers and further improve the output performance of these TENGs, Cd-CP was associated with different polarities of ethyl cellulose (EC) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to produce a variety of composite films, which were employed as triboelectrodes to engineer TENGs. The results indicated that the outputs of Cd-CP@EC-TENG exceeded those of Cd-CP@PVDF-TENG at the same doping proportion. In particular, 15% Cd-CP@EC-TENG possessed the best stability and highest outputs to light up white beads as a visible light source for the photoinduced C–H azidation reaction in good yields with high tolerance. The design and concept of this study not only verified that the components of the triboelectric layer played an important role in tuning TENG outputs but also provided an efficient pathway to realize photoinduced reactions with operational simplicity and high yields.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fascinating optical and electronic properties of emerging Cu(I) halides, their high melting points, irreversible decomposition, and intrinsic instability have hindered optoelectronic applications. Here, we designed novel Cu(I) halides, namely C12H28NCuCl2 and C20H48N2Cu4Cl6, with significantly lower melting points (86 and 122 °C), enabling remarkable moldability. Intriguingly, this investigation demonstrates that the aging and luminescence-quenching phenomena observed in C12H28NCuCl2 and C20H48N2Cu4Cl6 crystals resulting from the air oxidation can be effectively reversed through controlled heat treatment. The resulting C12H28NCuCl2 and C20H48N2Cu4Cl6 crystals exhibit broadband emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of 74.78% and 46.52%, respectively. Furthermore, C12H28NCuCl2 displays bright radioluminescence, showing an internal X-ray to light conversion efficiency of 36 506 photons/MeV under steady state X-ray illumination. The inherent melt processability of these materials empowers their transformation into diverse shapes suitable for practical applications. Herein, a sizable C12H28NCuCl2 scintillator screen (∼10 cm × 7 cm) was successfully prepared through a melt-processing method, achieving X-ray imaging resolution of 9 line pairs per millimeter (9 lp/mm). This study demonstrates the potential of melt-processable Cu(I) halides to be applied in various applications, because of their unique properties, including facile processing, moldability, and high X-ray luminescence.",

However, the antitumor efficiency of oxygen-dependent RT-RDT remains severely impeded by the hypoxic microenvironment prevalent in solid tumors. Here, we utilized Hf clusters and photosensitive ligands to prepare hierarchical porous metal–organic frameworks (HP-MOFs) with specific pore sizes, which can precisely encapsulate oxygen-carrying hemoglobin to alleviate tumor hypoxia, thus achieving significantly enhanced RT-RDT treatment efficiency. As high Z-metal, Hf clusters in MOF-based nanosensitizers allow for efficient deposition of X-ray energy to improve tumor cell sensitivities. Additionally, they serve as the scintillator to transfer the X-ray energy to photosensitive ligands, sensitizing oxygen to generate singlet oxygen. The incorporation of hemoglobin enables the direct delivery of sufficient oxygen to tumor cells, ameliorating the hypoxic state and potentiating the efficacy of RT-RDT. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the excellent anticancer effect and biocompatibility of the oxygen-enriched MOF-hemoglobin nanosystem under X-ray irradiation. This study constructs a MOF-based X-ray nanosensitizer integrating high-Z elements, photosensitizers, and oxygen-carrying proteins, which can effectively surmount the limitations encountered in clinical radiotherapy and provide a promising new direction for further advancement of RT-RDT.",

All of the COFs exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C–H functionalization based on halogen functionalities. Especially, the highest yield was achieved in the photocatalytic C–H thiolation of 1,4-naphthoquinones with Br-COF photocatalyst because of the suitable conduction band position.

    "abstract": "Imide-fused porphyrinoids are becoming key components in the area of molecular materials. Herein we report the synthesis of naphthalimide (NMI)-annulated subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) designed as an NIR-absorbing n-type organic semiconductor. Two different synthetic pathways could be applied for the preparation of NMI-fused SubPcs. The first consists of a [3 + 2] annulation between SubPc boronic ester and dibromo-NMI. This annulation, which involves the first CH activation reaction of a SubPc derivative reported so far, is totally regioselective to the β-position. Density functional theory (DFT) indicated that such position is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically. On the other hand, the second method relies on a cyclotrimerization of NMI-fused phthalonitrile. Electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations revealed that these NMI-fused SubPcs have low-lying LUMO energy levels suitable for electron charge transport. The N-alkyl substituted derivative (NMI-SubPc 2) was successfully applied as an nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) in combination with donor polymer PM6 in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) with a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.0%. This value is comparable to the record PCE of SubPc derivatives in BHJ-OSCs. Our results open a new vista in the preparation of π-extended contracted porphyrinoids and substantiate the potential of this new class of strong-absorbing electron-acceptor materials for applications in optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Nanostructured metal hydrides could play a key role in a hydrogen economy. The nanostructuring or confinement of these materials as, e.g., thin films significantly affects the structural and functional properties. For tantalum hydride, a versatile hydrogen sensing material, we show that the confinement of tantalum as a thin film extends the solubility limit by suppressing the phase transition observed in bulk upon hydrogenation. Different from bulk, the body centered cubic unit cell continuously deforms with unequal lattice constants and angles between lattice vectors. This deformation ensures that the volumetric expansion is realized in the out-of-plane direction, and surprisingly, completely elastic in nature. The first-order phase transition suppression combined with the continuous elastic deformation of the tantalum unit cell over an extraordinary wide solubility range ensures the superb performance of tantalum and its alloys as a hysteresis-free optical hydrogen sensing range over a hydrogen pressure/concentration range of over 7 orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Low-cost and efficient catalysts are highly required for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) to conveniently produce H2. Here, we have designed a CoOx catalyst grown on an ErOx nanosheet substrate (Co9Er1Ox) for the efficient hydrolysis of AB. Due to the favorable interfacial interaction between catalyst and substrate, the hybrid Co9Er1Ox catalyst shows a high total turnover frequency (TOF) value of 70.5 (H2) mol/(Cat-Co) mol·min with an activation energy of 48.5 kJ/mol, which is nearly 3 times higher than that of pure CoOx catalyst. Moreover, by using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, the self-reconstruction of Co during the hydrolysis process has been probed, which can transform the oxidized Co into a metallic Co particle as the real active site. Interestingly, a Co-B intermediate based on metallic Co has been first observed from the in situ XAS, strongly supporting the catalyst-AB interaction to facilitate the hydrolysis reaction.",

This has been extensively studied for covalent chalcogenide nanocrystals, but little progress has been made for ionic halide perovskite nanocrystals. Stabilizing the different surface facets, mostly, determines the nature of the polyhedral shapes and also helps in understanding the formation of their anisotropic structures. Recent progresses of different polyhedral halide perovskite nanocrystals suggest that their formations are mostly reagent specific. Two halide reagents, benzoyl bromide and phenacyl bromide, which are only different in one −CH2– group, showed drastic difference in the shapes of resulting CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. While former resulted in the cube shape, the later triggered the formation of dodecahedron-shaped nanocrystals. Keeping this in mind, the chemical activities of these reagents for the shape evolution of binary and ternary metal halides and their conversion to halide perovskites with B-site ions introduction are investigated in detail and reported in this perspective. In addition, the cross exchanges in these two reagents and other possible pathways are also proposed for possible dimension tunable halide perovskite nanocrystals.",

However, HaB elements are currently under-investigated as a part of functional materials in separation science. Herein, we develop a novel approach for introducing HaB elements into UiO-66 to fine-tune the adsorption properties toward chlorobenzenes (CBs). A series of UiO-66 containing various contents of 2-iodoterephtalic acid (I-TA) (0%, 33%, 50%, 67%, and 100%) was prepared, characterized, and applied for the selective removal of CB contaminants from nonchlorinated aromatic analogues that cannot be separated by common distillation. Investigation of the structure–property relationship revealed that the highest adsorption capacity was achieved in the case of UiO-66 loaded with 50% I-TA (UiO-66-Iopt), and this was attributed to the balance between the number of HaB elements and the surface area of the UiO-66 structure. According to density functional theory calculations, the formation of a conjugate between dichlorobenzene and UiO-66-Iopt was more energetically favorable (up to 1.7 kcal/mol) than that of the corresponding conjugate with UiO-66. The formation of HaBs was experimentally verified by UV–vis, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. To obtain functional materials for separation applications, waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was used as a support and feedstock for the surface-assisted growth of UiO-66-Iopt. The as-prepared PET@UiO-66-Iopt exhibited a close-to-perfect selectivity and reusability for the separation of a wide range of CBs from nonchlorinated aromatic analogues.",

Although numerous high-performance ternary OSCs have been established, the underlying fundamentals of ternary OSCs are still not fully understood, and a general rule for the ternary system design is highly appreciated. In this contribution, we demonstrate the construction of high-performance ternary OSCs via the co-crystallization of conjugated host donor PM6 and guest donor D18-Cl. Due to the similar chemical structure, larger planarity, and lower surface energy of D18-Cl, it locates in the PM6 phase and organizes with PM6 during solution casting, leading to the formation of co-crystallized fibrillar donor phase with enhanced structural order and charge transport channels. As a result, a series of binary host systems, including PM6:BTP-4F-C6-16, PM6:Y6, and PM6:Y7-BO obtained enhanced efficiency with the presence of D18-Cl as the guest donor, achieving a superior PCE of 18.5% in the PM6:D18-Cl:BTP-4F-C6-16 ternary OSCs. This work is the first demonstration of co-crystallized polymer donor fibrils to boost the charge transport and power conversion of ternary OSCs.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) is the hallmark of ferroptosis therapy. However, a single ferroptosis process has difficulty inhibiting tumor progress. Autophagy inhibitors can inhibit autophagy by blocking automatic capsules and closing the self-protection pathway of oxidative stress, which promotes a Fenton or Fenton-like reaction to enhance LPO accumulation. Herein, a versatile core–shell nanoparticle system, denoted as CQ/PEG-CuS@hMnO2, was designed and synthesized for reactive oxygen-primed and autophagy inhibition-sensitized ferroptosis. Glutathione (GSH) depletion by CuS@hMnO2 caused the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), the key defense protein of ferroptosis. Highly toxic ROS were generated by Mn2+-mediated Fenton-like reaction to reinforce the intracellular oxidative stress, directly resulting in the accumulation of LPO. Meanwhile, autophagy played an indispensable effect in ferroptosis; thus, the loading of chloroquine (CQ) as an autophagy inhibitor aimed to enhance the sensitivity of ferroptosis. Besides, the excellent photothermal therapy effect could be triggered by NIR irradiation (980 nm) due to CuS core. In vivo and in vitro experiment results demonstrated that CQ/PEG-CuS@hMnO2 presented an excellent anticancer effect in the human breast cancer model, proving that the ferroptosis/photothermal dual-inductive strategy is promising to combat malignant tumors.",

However, the competitive growth between low-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) structures leads to a complex and uncontrollable crystallization process, thus leading to the random orientation, disordered structure, and poor carrier dynamics in the corresponding devices. Here, we proposed a gradient thermal annealing (GTA) to deposit high-quality tin halide perovskite films with stable structure and low defect density by controlling the crystal growth process. Femtosecond transient absorptions confirmed that this strategy can adjust the growth speed of perovskites with different dimensions, and reduce the proportion of small n-phases which tend to grow parallel to the substrate. This further facilitated the charge transfer and enhanced the charge carrier transport and extraction. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding quasi-2D (⟨n⟩ = 10) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) TPSCs was increased from 9.14% to 12.05% with strengthened environmental stability. Notably, this approach is also applicable in both RP and Dion-Jacobson (DJ) quasi-2D TPSCs, which provides a method to high efficiency quasi-2D TPSCs by regulating the carrier transport.",

Metal–organic framework (MOF) physisorbents that are C3H8 selective offer the potential to significantly reduce the energy footprint for capturing C3H8 from natural gas, where C3H8 is typically present as a minor component. Here we report the C3H8 recovery performance of a previously unreported lonsdaleite, lon, topology MOF, a chiral metal–organic material, [Ni(S-IEDC)(bipy)(SCN)]n, CMOM-7. CMOM-7 was prepared from three low-cost precursors: Ni(SCN)2, S-indoline-2-carboxylic acid (S-IDECH), and 4,4′-bipyridine (bipy), and its structure was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Pure gas adsorption isotherms revealed that CMOM-7 exhibited high C3H8 uptake (2.71 mmol g–1) at 0.05 bar, an indication of a higher affinity for C3H8 than both C2H6 and CH4. Dynamic column breakthrough experiments afforded high purity C3H8 capture from a gas mixture comprising C3H8/C2H6/CH4 (v/v/v = 5/10/85). Despite the dilute C3H8 stream, CMOM-7 registered a high dynamic uptake of C3H8 and a breakthrough time difference between C3H8 and C2H6 of 79.5 min g–1, superior to those of previous MOF physisorbents studied under the same flow rate. Analysis of crystallographic data and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations provides insight into the two C3H8 binding sites in CMOM-7, both of which are driven by C–H···π and hydrogen bonding interactions.",

    "abstract": "Solar-driven evaporation is considered to be a sustainable water treatment technology that helps alleviate global water shortages. However, the secondary pollution caused by the accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the evaporation threatens water safety. Here, we designed a highly efficient 3D evaporator that combines supramolecular iron phthalocyanine organic polymer (PcOP-Fe) and CoFe2O4 (CFO) for simultaneous water evaporation and VOC degradation. It was demonstrated that the matched energy level of PcOP-Fe with CFO material can promote the photocarrier separation of CFO and further improve the photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the excellent photothermal performance of CFO can increase the local temperature to improve the transfer of photocarriers in PcOP-Fe and accelerate the reaction kinetics of VOC degradation simultaneously. Therefore, the designed evaporator exhibited an evaporation rate of 2.03 kg m–2 h–1 under 1 sun (1 kW m–2) irradiation and a desalination efficiency over 99.7% for simulated seawater. Particularly, the evaporator delivers a high degradation efficiency ranging from 89.7% to 98.4% toward VOCs including phenol, N,N-dimethylformamide, and aniline. This work provides an effective evaporator with excellent photothermal and photocatalytic performance that can be applied in sewage treatment and seawater desalination.",

Herein, we demonstrate the first example of functionalization in the cluster-nodes of a metal–organic framework (MOF) for attaining light-responsive proton conduction. Specifically, the photoactive molecules of azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (AZOA) are grafted onto the Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 nodes of MOF-808 through the partial substitution of the terminal formates, giving MOF-808-AZOA. Remarkably, MOF-808-AZOA exhibits switchable proton conduction in responsive to UV light, featuring a substantial ON/OFF ratio, rapid response time, and good reversibility. Molecular simulations indicate that the light-responsive proton conduction in MOF-808-AZOA is attributed to differential interactions between the terminated formates and the −COOH group in AZOA with its cis- or trans-configuration. Given the diversity of cluster-based MOFs, this study opens up a promising avenue for realizing stimuli-responsive proton-conducting MOFs through cluster-node functionalization.",

Because of the multiple cells or multiple emitters, the structure of normal WOLEDs is sophisticated, resulting in high fabrication costs and low long-term stability. To overcome these hurdles, WOLEDs based on platinum (Pt) complexes with a single light-emitting layer demonstrate promising potential. Herein, we report the regulation of Pt···Pt interaction of Pt(II) complexes by methylation of the ligand tuning the emission of monomer and excimer, resulting in realizing correlated color temperature (CCT) adjustable WOLEDs. Single-doped WOLEDs based on Im2PhPtCl with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.36), color rendering index (CRI) over 83, high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.4%, and low-efficiency roll-offs (EQE = 23.9% at 1000 cd m–2, EQE = 20.7% at 5000 cd m–2) are accomplished by using exciplex as a host. More importantly, the CCT of the WOLEDs could be tuned between 2751 and 7061 K by simply changing the driving voltages and closely matching with daylight locus from dawn until dusk. The outstanding device performances illuminate the state-of-the-art for WOLEDs, and their further applications may let people enjoy sunbathing indoors.",

    "abstract": "Zero-dimensional (0D) tetrahedral Mn(II) halides (MnX42– (X = Cl, Br, I)) have emerged as solid-state green emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). However, their PLQYs are significantly dependent on the environment surrounding the Mn(II), i.e., the organic cation and the halide. Although the tetrahedral Mn(II) bromide is highly emissive, Mn(II) iodide exhibits relatively low PLQY. Herein, we report the preparation of organic–inorganic hybrid tetrahedral Mn(II) halides (Cl, Br, and I) using the organic cation protonated 4-dimethylaminopyridine ((DMAPH)+), and they all exhibit bright green luminescence with high PLQY (∼76%–80%), regardless of the halide ion. Surprisingly, DMAPH undergoes N-demethylation exclusively in the case of tetrahedral Mn(II) iodide. Furthermore, we find that the controlled Zn2+-doping/alloying in the Mn(II) halide lattice improves the PLQY to near-unity (∼88%–94%) and is stable for more than 60 days. The increase of the excited state decay time in time-resolved PL lifetime measurements revealed that the improved luminescence is due to reduced Mn(II)–Mn(II) interactions of the lattice upon replacing some of the Mn(II) with Zn(II). This is further supported by the Zn-alloying-induced hyperfine splitting of Mn(II) ions observed in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. However, excess alloying reduces PLQY due to the decrease in the tetrahedral Mn(II) concentration in the lattice. These results demonstrate the fabrication of hybrid Mn(II) halide (Cl, Br, and I) single crystals with near-unity PLQY and provide design strategies to improve their PLQY by selective organic cations and doping/alloying.",

    "abstract": "An ideal adsorbent is supposed to possess a strong adsorbate–adsorbent interaction during adsorption and a weak adsorbate–adsorbent interaction during desorption. However, conventional adsorbents have fixed properties and are less likely to meet the demand for adsorption and desorption simultaneously. In this paper, we report spiropyran (SP)-based smart adsorbents with dynamically tunable properties for gas adsorption. Nitro-substituted SP molecules were embedded in a typical metal–organic framework (MOF), MIL-101(Cr), leading to the generation of SP@M. Upon thermal stimulation, the embedded SP isomerizes to the merocyanine (MC) form and can revert back to the initial ring-closed state through spontaneous thermal relaxation. The adsorption capacity of the adsorbent on CO is tunable upon isomerization, and the CO adsorption amount is increased by 37% when SP is isomerized to MC. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that MC is more inclined to capture the CO molecule than SP due to stronger binding energy. We also demonstrate that the tunable adsorption capacity upon isomerization can be maintained during 2.5 cycles without degradation.",

Herein, a diboron-based molecule, PhCzDBA, is designed and its device exhibits a maximum EQE (EQEmax) of 33.8% and only slight roll-off (EQEmax of 31.5% at 1000 cd m–2 and 28.8% at 3000 cd m–2). Furthermore, it shows superior stability among reported TADF devices (LT80 of 113 h at the initial luminance of 3000 cd m–2). Remarkably, its nondoped OLED shows a high EQEmax of 17.7% with a λmax > 580 nm, surpassing most orange nondoped OLEDs. Moreover, a decent white OLED device with an EQEmax of 16.4% and a color rendering index (CRI) of 73 can be achieved by incorporating a simple sandwich emitting layer configuration, exhibiting the potential and diverse applications in many aspects.",

    "abstract": "High power conversion efficiencies (PCE), low energy payback time (EPBT), and low manufacturing costs render perovskite solar cells (PSCs) competitive; however, a relatively low operational stability impedes their large-scale deployment. In addition, state-of-the-art PSCs are made of expensive materials, including the organic hole transport materials (HTMs) and the noble metals used as the charge collection electrode, which induce degradation in PSCs. Thus, developing inexpensive alternatives is crucial to fostering the transition from academic research to industrial development. Combining a carbon-based electrode with an inorganic HTM has shown the highest potential and should replace noble metals and organic HTMs. In this review, we illustrate the incorporation of a carbon layer as a back contact instead of noble metals and inorganic HTMs instead of organic ones as two cornerstones for achieving optimal stability and economic viability for PSCs. We discuss the primary considerations for the selection of the absorbing layer as well as the electron-transporting layer to be compatible with the champion designs and ultimate architecture for single-junction PSCs. More studies regarding the long-term stability are still required. Using the recommended device architecture presented in this work would pave the way toward constructing low-cost and stable PSCs.",

    "abstract": "The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been considered as a promising approach to convert atmospheric CO2 to value-added chemicals to promote carbon neutrality. However, developing electrocatalysts with superior activity and high selectivity toward individual products remains a great challenge. Herein we report the electronic structure modulation of unconventional phase metal nanomaterials to achieve highly efficient CO2 electroreduction. It has been found that growing cerium oxide (CeOx) nanostructures on 4H/face-centered cubic (fcc) gold (Au) nanorods can significantly enhance their catalytic activity and selectivity toward the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to carbon monoxide. X-ray analysis indicates the electronic structure change of 4H/fcc Au nanorods after CeOx overgrowth. In-situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy measurements reveal that the HCO3– concentration near the surface of Au-CeOx heteronanostructures is much higher than that of Au nanorods, facilitating the CO2 reduction process. Density functional theory calculations suggest the activation effect of CeOx on the 4H/fcc Au nanorod surface for the electrocatalytic CO2RR. The synergy between 4H/fcc Au and CeOx promotes the formation of carboxyl (*COOH) species and thus boosts the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. This work highlights the importance of rational electronic structure regulation of unusual phase nanomaterials toward the electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules.",

The activation of PZCT is bioorthogonally controlled by tumor-specific miR-21, which generates numerous DNAzyme for silencing EGR-1 mRNA with the assistance of Zn2+ from PZCT. Simultaneously, the doped copper ions on PZCT exert chemo-dynamic therapy (CDT) by reducing glutathione (GSH) and converting endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radical (·OH). These combination therapies exhibited remarkable tumor elimination effects in vivo and promised excellent tumor specificity via a bioorthogonal strategy.

In this study, we present a novel approach by employing a size-selective fluorescent protein probe to characterize macroporous defects induced by tartaric acid in a zirconium-based MOF, NU-1000. The spatial visualization of defects using a hemoglobin-based fluorescent probe allows for the identification of distinct structural weak points and defect formation mechanisms in NU-1000 crystallites prepared by various methods. In addition to confirming findings from conventional MOF characterization methods, such as gas sorption isotherms and powdered X-ray diffraction analysis, the hemoglobin-based protein probe unveils structural nuances overlooked by many traditional characterization techniques.",

In this work, a series of Cu(I) complexes that display blue-shifted and enhanced luminescence under pressure are designed via a guest encapsulation strategy. Detailed study reveals that, after grinding, the stacking mode of Cu(I) complexes cracks and the encapsulated guests release rapidly, along with the decrease in the surrounding polarity of emitters and the corresponding luminescence change. Moreover, it is proven that, by adjusting the ratio of metal/halogen-to-ligand charge transfer, the pressure-induced luminescent blue shifts can be effectively modulated (from 40 to 90 nm). Also importantly, such piezochromic luminescence is recoverable. The rarely observed and large blue shift (90 nm) indicates the high availability for this guest encapsulation strategy as well.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report the discovery of the first (8,8)-connected three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF), TUS-88, having bcu topology by linking an 8-connected D4h-symmetric quadrangular prism node to an 8-connected D2h-symmetric tetragonal prism node. Derived from the π-aromatic conjugated system of pyrene and the abundant aromatic phenyl rings composing the COF scaffold, which promotes stronger π···π interactions with aromatic benzene (Bz) molecules, a superlative Bz uptake of 464 cm3 g–1 was achieved for TUS-88, coupled with exemplary cyclohexane (Cy) uptake of 224 cm3 g–1 and ideal Bz/Cy selectivity of 2.07 which are the current benchmark. Breakthrough experiments accomplished using a Bz/Cy (1:1, v/v) mixture corroborated the preferential adsorption of Bz by the COF from the mixture to generate high-purity Cy with a significant time interval of 75.4 min g–1 and a record-setting Bz/Cy breakthrough selectivity of 2.46.",

    "abstract": "Stretchable transparent electrodes are crucial components for deformable electronics. While solid-state electrodes struggle to achieve significant stretchability, liquid metal electrodes have emerged as a potential alternative. However, their widespread application has been limited by their complex fabrication and reduced performance when stretched. This study introduces stretchable transparent electrodes composed of liquid metal in serpentine micromesh patterns. These electrodes are constructed cost-effectively to show high optical transmittance and low sheet resistance. They can endure 800% strain with limited variations in resistance due to the serpentine design. A transparent proximity and touch sensor is combined with soft pneumatic actuators to enable a deformable haptic interface. Additionally, transparent heaters are prepared to conform to the curvilinear body surface, allowing for thermotherapy on subcutaneous tumors while concurrently monitoring the skin's responses. Liquid metal serpentine micromeshes represent promising transparent electrodes for stretchable devices and systems.",

However, the laborious process of optimizing solvent ratios and the environmental harm caused by organic solvents constrain the facile and large-scale synthesis of COFs. Consequently, employing water as an environmentally benign reaction medium is highly desirable for synthesizing chemically stable vinylene-linked COF materials. In this study, we report a novel self-template hydrothermal approach for preparing vinylene-linked COF nanosheets via the molecule/water interfacial Knoevenagel condensation. These nanosheets exhibit substantial resistance to both acids and alkalis. The vinylene-linked COF-based memristor demonstrated characteristic nonvolatile rewritable memory effects, featuring a small switch-on voltage of −0.65 V and an ultrafast switching speed of 120 ns. Benefiting from the chemical durability of the COF nanosheets, the memristor maintained excellent stability in switching and retention performance after the acid and base treatments. Moreover, the vinylene-linked COF-based memristors successfully performed \"AND\" and \"OR\" logic operations, demonstrating their potential for advanced computing applications.",

Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the structural properties of the material are linked to strong hydrogen bonding in TA-betaine and TA-choline chloride mixtures.

Herein, we fabricated a pillar-layered MOF (Zn-LC–C) with fsc topology, utilizing a tetradentate carboxylic ligand with bipyridine and Zn(II) ions via the pillar-layered approach. Notably, this topological structure displays markedly superior stability compared with typical pillar-layered MOFs with pcu topology. In addition, by introducing unsaturated bonds to modify and increase the length of the pillars, three additional pillar-layered MOFs (Zn-LN=N, Zn-LC=C, and Zn-LC≡C) were obtained. Compared with those of Zn-LC–C, the adsorption capacities for C2H2 of the other three structures have been improved. Strikingly, the dynamic adsorption uptake of Zn-LN=N for C2H2 is as high as 53.7 cm3 g–1, and the dynamic separation ratio of C2H2/CO2 is 3.2. These results demonstrate that the introduction of diazo groups in the pillar can enhance the adsorption capacities of pillar-layered MOFs to C2H2.",

Here we show the synthesis of a fully conjugated 2D benzothiophene-linked COF (2DCOF-S) by the postmodification of a bromine-functionalized, vinyl-linked 2D COF (i.e., v-2DCOF-Br) through thiolation annulation. The high π conjugation largely extended the light absorption edge from 480 to 800 nm. Furthermore, an intrinsic donor–acceptor (D-A) structure between the benzothiophene and triazine cores was obtained, which significantly improves the separation capability of photogenerated electrons and holes. Finally, we demonstrate that the 2DCOF-S exhibited excellent performance in photoelectrocatalytic uranium extraction, in which the maximum saturated adsorption capacity of uranium is up to 643 mg g–1 within 2 h, which is superior to most COF-based extraction materials.",

The DES(CC-V)/KCN homojunction exhibits a negative conduction band position and facilitates directional electron transfer and separation. The modification with DES(CC-V) increases the oxygen active sites and the hydroxyl amount, enhancing hydrophilicity. The synergistic effect of electron transport, active sites, and hydrophilicity promotes the photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction, thus amplifying the open circuit potential and power density of the self-powered system. A self-powered sensing showcased high sensitivity, stability, and applicability for lead ions in a water environment and achieved portable monitoring via a multimeter device with a limit of detection (0.4 ng L–1).

However, the strong binding affinity of thiol ligands has limited the broader use of Ag2Te CQDs, necessitating more versatile surface chemistries. Here, we synthesized Ag2Te CQDs passivated with oleylamine, which facilitated various ligand passivation strategies. The weak bonding strength allows the preparation of X-Ag2Te CQD (X = Cl, Br, or I ligands) inks, sensitive to 1.1–2.7 μm infrared radiation. Using the CQD inks, we fabricated extended short-wavelength infrared (eSWIR) CQD photodiodes with two different sizes of CQDs.

    "abstract": "Semiconducting polymers have received increased attention in recent years as low-cost, electrically conductive layers. To show reasonable electrical conductivity, however, semiconducting polymers must be doped, a process that requires oxidation or reduction of the conjugated backbone and structural rearrangement to accommodate a charge-balancing counterion into the polymer network. Here, we aim to understand how this structural rearrangement contributes to the energetics of doping. We utilize the fact that rub-aligned poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) films contain two polymorphs, one with a crystal structure that is less dense than the structure observed in unaligned films and the other with a more compact, denser structure. The two structures are dominantly face-on and edge-on with respect to the substrate, respectively, so their diffraction is well separated in q-space and thus doping induced structural changes can be monitored separately for each population. When films are doped with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), the less-dense face-on oriented P3HT polymorph undergoes doping induced structural change more easily than the denser edge-on oriented polymorph. This finding suggests that rearrangement of the polymer crystal structure to accommodate the dopant counterion is a significant energetic term in the doping process and that doping of semiconducting polymers can be facilitated by designing new polymers where dopant counterions can be accommodated in the polymer lattice with reduced structural change.",

    "abstract": "We provide direct evidence for a spin-active V4+ defect center, likely in the form of a VO2+ complex, predominantly introduced in single crystals of vanadium-doped Cs2NaInCl6 halide double perovskites grown by the solution-processed hydrothermal method. The defect has C4v point group symmetry, exhibiting an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum arising from an effective electron spin of S = 1/2 and a nuclear spin of I = 7/2 (corresponding to 51V with nearly 100% natural abundance). The determined electron g-factor and hyperfine parameter values are g⊥= 1.973, g∥ = 1.945, A⊥ = 180 MHz, and A∥ = 504 MHz, with the principal axis z along a ⟨001⟩ crystallographic axis. The controlled growth of V-doped Cs2NaInCl6 in an oxygen-free environment is shown to suppress the V4+ EPR signal. The defect model is suggested to have a VOCl5 octahedral coordination, where one of the nearest-neighbor Cl– of V is replaced by O2–, with octahedral compression along the V–O axis. This VO complex formation competes with the isolated V3+ substitution of In3+, which in turn provides a means for the charge-state tuning of V ions. This finding calls for a better understanding and control of defect formation in solution-grown halide double perovskites, which is critical for optimizing and tailoring material design for solution-processable optoelectronics and spintronics.",

Mankind's ability to master water, however, is far from impeccable, and a sustainable supply of clean fresh water remains a global challenge. Here, we learn from Nature and prepare papyrus carbon (PC) from Egyptian papyrus paper as a sustainable solar desalination material. By taking advantage of the capillary pores from vascular bundles that are inherently built for transporting water in plants, PC achieves an evaporation rate of 4.1 kg m–2 h–1 in a passive single-stage device. Raman spectroscopy and thermal calorimetry show that the capillary pores pose a confinement effect to generate loosely hydrogen-bonded intermediate water, which substantially reduces the enthalpy of vaporization, allowing for exceptionally high energy efficiencies. The understanding is applicable to all nature-designed vascular plants and man-made separation and purification systems.",

    "abstract": "Switching coordination networks (CNs) that reversibly transform between narrow or closed pore (cp) and large pore (lp) phases, though fewer than their rigid counterparts, offer opportunities for sorption-related applications. However, their structural transformations and switching mechanisms remain underexplored at the molecular level. In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation into a 2D switching CN, [Ni(bpy)2(NCS)2]n, sql-1-Ni-NCS (1 = bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine), using coincident gas sorption and in situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) under low-temperature conditions. Gas adsorption measurements revealed that C2H4 (169 K) and C2H6 (185 K) exhibited single-step type F–IVs sorption isotherms with sorption uptakes of around 180–185 cm3 g–1, equivalent to four sorbate molecules per formula unit. Furthermore, parallel in situ PXRD experiments provided insight into sorbate-dependent phase switching during the sorption process. Specifically, CO2 sorption induced single-step phase switching (path I) solely between cp and lp phases consistent with the observed single-step type F–IVs sorption isotherm. By contrast, intermediate pore (ip) phases emerged during C2H4 and C2H6 desorption as well as C3H6 adsorption, although they remained undetectable in the sorption isotherms. To our knowledge, such a cp-lp-ip-cp transformation (path II) induced by C2H4/6 and accompanied by single-step type F–IVs sorption isotherms represents a novel type of phase transition mechanism in switching CNs. By virtue of Rietveld refinements and molecular simulations, we elucidated that the phase transformations are governed by cooperative local and global structural changes involving NCS– ligand reorientation, bpy ligand twist and rotation, cavity edge (Ni-bpy-Ni) deformation, and interlayer expansion and sliding.",

    "abstract": "The design of donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers with narrow bandgaps remains a big challenge for achieving high-performance near-infrared (NIR) phototransistors. Herein, we report a novel D–A conjugated polymer (denoted as TBOPV-DT) based on a thiophene-fused benzodifurandione-based oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (TBOPV) acceptor in conjugation with a 3,3′-dialkoxy-2,2′-dithiophene (DT) donor. Benefiting from the alkoxylation of the donor units, the TBOPV-DT conjugated polymer exhibits broad second NIR absorption and a narrow bandgap of 0.65 eV. When being used as the channel material in field-effect transistors, the TBOPV-DT conjugated polymer shows p-type semiconducting behavior with a hole mobility of 0.16 cm2 V–1 s–1. Besides, the resulting single-component polymer phototransistor displays ultrahigh sensitivity to a broad range of wavelengths (850–1450 nm) and a record-high photoresponsivity of 1.9 × 105 A W–1. Moreover, the fast rise and decay response times of 53 and 317 ms, respectively, are comparable to those of state-of-the-art two-dimensional materials. This work sheds light on designing new narrow-bandgap D–A conjugated polymers with molecular precision and paves the way for the development of future high-performance optoelectronics.",

In this study, we successfully synthesized five gram-scale pairs of enantiomers by utilizing chiral proparylbenzylamine ligands and copper halides as precursors. Notably, these enantiomers incorporate ionic, coordinate bonds, and C–H···π interactions to significantly enhance their stability and crystallinity. Derived from either Br– or I–, the enantiomers exhibited distinct skeletal characteristics, resulting in four different structural types. A thorough analysis was undertaken to elucidate the origins of the chirality within each of these structural motifs. Remarkably, all of the enantiomers displayed photoluminescence and mirror-image circular dichroism (CD) responses. Of particular interest, the one-dimensional (1D) compound R/S-1 exhibited pronounced CPL activities and an anisotropy factor (glum) of ∼0.007 in its crystalline state.

    "abstract": "Organic thermoelectric materials have garnered significant interest as promising candidates for energy harvesting applications. In recent years, ethylene-glycol side-chain engineering in organic semiconductors has gradually become an efficient approach to boost the performance of organic thermoelectrics. Although this strategy is widely utilized, the impact of their volume and branching structure remains unknown. This contribution describes a trade-off phenomenon between the oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains and thermoelectric properties based on the n-type doped low-bandgap conjugated polymers, achieved through the modification of the volume and structure of side chains. Three conjugated polymers comprising a naphthalenediimide-dialkoxybithiazole backbone and different linear length or branched OEG side chains exhibit good host/dopant miscibility after doping. We find that, in the linear OEG side-chain-based polymers, the increased volume of side chains slightly influences the planarity of backbones, thereby leading to similar and satisfactory thermoelectric performances. The high fraction of side chains does not consistently yield enhanced performance, as the branched OEG side-chain introduces steric hindrance. Consequently, the accordingly conjugated backbones become less planar and rigid, resulting in critical molecular packing changes and low charge carrier mobility and doping efficiency and thus low thermoelectric performance. Our work provides a unique insight into the fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing and thermoelectric properties and guides the future rational design of efficient n-type organic semiconductors.",

In this work, ENBS not only selectively accumulates in lysosomes and disrupts the integrity of lysosomes but also induces gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptosis. As a result, it finally promotes the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), achieving T-cell-mediated immune activation in vivo.

However, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are relatively inferior, mainly imputed to the challenges in controlling active layer morphologies. Herein, FSBTSeHR, a small-molecule donor (SMD) was added to the B1:BTP-eC9 blend. FSBTSeHR exhibits high crystallinity, improving the molecular packing in the ternary blend. Furthermore, FSBTSeHR has better miscibility with the host donor B1 than with BTP-eC9, leading to a proper nanoscale phase separation morphology in the ternary active layer. The optimized active layer morphology facilitates charge transport and extraction while suppressing charge recombination in ternary devices. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) reveals a rapid exciton dissociation and diffusion process in the blend of B1:FSBTSeHR:BTP-eC9, which is consistent with its improved morphology. Thus, the ternary device obtained a remarkable PCE (17.04%), which is one of the highest values in ASM-OSCs to date.",

Tight-binding models allowed us to evaluate the respective strengths of intra- and interchain electronic couplings in n-PBDF.

Since these polyamide networks are covalently bonded, we demonstrated their unique durability by repeatable elastic recovery at elevated temperatures, exhibiting indifferent tensile properties in each cycle. Furthermore, when we fixed the strain during the elastic recovery, these polyamide networks actuated stresses of 9–18 MPa, among the highest reported in shape-memory polymer actuators.

Reduction in weight, volume, and costs are of paramount importance to enable commercialization and popularization of PEMFCs. In this context, aluminum emerges as a promising candidate for BPPs, although its corrosion resistance is inadequate for the harsh environment of PEMFCs. Recently, titanium nitride (TiN) coatings have shown potential to increase the corrosion resistance of aluminum BPPs. Herein, we discovered that the performance of the aluminum-TiN functional system in a simulated PEMFC environment can be tailored by synthesis parameters.

We demonstrated that the coplanar arrangement of the amino group with respect to the benzene ring bearing the dicyanomethyl radical by O or S bridges causes the drastic bathochromic shift of the radical absorption bands toward the NIR region. In particular, the radical with two bridging O atoms has the most red-shifted radical band of λmax = 1059 nm compared to that of the radical with no bridging O atoms (λmax = 712 nm). Due to the significant bathochromic shift of the radical bands, these radicals have a wide optical window in the visible region. In particular, the radical with the two-O bridge shows almost no perceptible color change to the naked eye and remains highly transparent over all temperature ranges, whereas the intensity of the NIR absorption drastically changes. These radicals maintained their absorption properties in a polycarbonate matrix and high stability.",

We report here the design of artificial interphase films that have intrinsic high Na+-ion conductivity, which enable protected Na electrodes with simultaneously improved surface stability and redox kinetics. They were prepared from Mo6S8 films, which transform to NaxMo6S8 (x ≈ 16) through an in-situ sodiation process when pressed onto Na metal. The protected Na electrodes were stable in dry air for days and exhibited 2.5 times higher exchange current density compared with pristine Na electrodes.

We examine how iodide vacancies and O2 molecules influence the local geometry and electronic structure. Our calculations, supported by Kelvin Probe contact potential difference and photoluminescence measurements, show that introduction of O2 leads to a p-doped triple-cation perovskite and passivates iodide vacancies, resulting in enhanced luminescence efficiency.

By using 1,4-dicyanobenzene (DCB), 1,3-dicyanobeznene (mDCB), or 2,6-dicyanopyridine (DCP) as the monomer precursors for the CTFs, we found that ZnCl2 acts as an effective porogen in the system from monomers with weak solvent–solute interactions (DCB and mDCB). The resulting HPCs derived from DCB and mDCB exhibit a systematically tunable hierarchical porosity with an average pore size ranging from 2.5–8.0 nm, by varying the concentration of monomers in solution. We show a decreasing DCB to ZnCl2 ratio gives rise to larger mesopores, with improved pore connectivity and accessibility that is beneficial to mass transport and ion diffusion for high performance electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) at high mass loadings. We demonstrate EDLCs with specific capacity values over 155 F/g at high mass loadings of 15 mg/cm2, delivering exceptional areal capacities of over 2.27 F/cm2 at low rates and 1.48 F/cm2 at high rates.",

    "abstract": "Organic lasing dyes possessing small energy gaps commonly suffer from high thresholds, because of energy-gap law, which induces detrimental nonradiative relaxation. Herein, molecules based on alternating donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties are described. Those linear molecules are built with a spacer between D and A, with a general formula of D–spacer–A–spacer–D. Such modification of the A core allows one to obtain color-tunable lasing properties from yellow to near-infrared (NIR). Into more details, triphenylamine (TPA) is selected as the D moiety, while benzothiadiazole (BTD) and benzo[1,2-c:4,5c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBTD) with strong electron-withdrawing capability, are chosen as A cores for yellow ((TPA-F)2BTD) and NIR ((TPA-F)2BBTD) lasing dyes, respectively. Both dyes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and fast fluorescence radiative rate. The corresponding amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds of yellow and NIR dyes are as low as 0.5 and 3.8 μJ cm–2 in the solution-processing blending films, with wavelength peaks at 550 and 811 nm, respectively. In those dyes, the long alkyl chains appended on the fluorene conjugated spacer guarantee the high solubility and prevent aggregation. Consequently, for (TPA-F)2BTD, the neat film allows one to reach PLQYs as high as 90%, with a low ASE threshold (1.9 μJ cm–2) and good stability. Therefore, such promising molecular design allows the realization of color-tunable ASE or lasing dyes with very low thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite oxynitride photocatalysts were reported by experiment to evolve small amounts of N2, because of the self-oxidation of nitrogen ions by photogenerated holes. The N2 evolution rate was observed to decrease with increasing reaction time and was found to be correlated with a decrease in O2 evolution (OER) activity, the origin of this latter effect however being unknown. Here, we investigate, by means of density functional theory calculation, anion vacancies at the TaON-terminated (001) surface of the perovskite oxynitride SrTaO2N. We find an energetic preference for oxygen and nitrogen vacancies to reside at the surface, where they are spontaneously healed by *O and *OH adsorbates under OER conditions. For nitrogen vacancies, this self-healing leads to an altered stoichiometry Ta4O8+xN4–x that is accompanied by electron doping. Substitution of N by O at the surface also leads to tensile strain, which confines the excess charge to the very surface layer, affecting the binding energy of reaction intermediates and significantly increasing the OER overpotential. This peculiar change in electronic structure thus provides an atomic-scale explanation for the experimentally observed drop in OER activity of perovskite oxynitrides.",

While sulfur-containing materials are conventionally expected to result in high refractive index (nD/20 °C > 1.6) materials, this expectation is rarely realized with thiol-X photopolymers, because of the lack of monomers with sufficiently high refractive indices. Here, an efficient, modular synthetic strategy to obtain high refractive index thiol-X monomers is presented. The efficacy of the overall approach is demonstrated using only commercially available starting compounds to yield low viscosity (<500 cP) liquid multifunctional thiol and diallyl ether monomers with high refractive indices (nD/20 °C > 1.64). These synthesized monomers underwent rapid thiol-ene photopolymerizations to high conversions, achieving refractive index values (nD/20 °C) up to 1.669 in uniform crosslinked networks exhibiting typical narrow and well-defined loss tangent (tan δ) peaks. The convenience of the low-viscosity, high optical quality thiol-ene resins was demonstrated in the fabrication of two functional optical components. First, a plano-convex lens was aspherized using an overmolding procedure. Second, a two-dimensional grating was fabricated using a two-stage material and a photomask exposure.",

    "abstract": "Advances in nanocrystal syntheses over the past decades now enable routine manipulation of particle shape, size, and chemistry with unprecedented precision. Building on decades of knowledge in colloidal chemistry, researchers have created notable high-performance, low-cost energy conversion catalysts. However, in almost all cases, controlling the surface chemistry—in particular, removing the surfactants used during the syntheses—is a challenge. Aggressive physical treatments, such as thermal pyrolysis and plasma etching, have become the methods of choice, but these processes test the material's phase and chemical stability. In this work, we analyze softer methods to postsynthetically remove surfactants using chemical treatments. We performed various surface treatments to deprotect colloidal nanocrystals of a well-known electrocatalyst, manganese oxide (Mn3O4), passivated with hydrophobic ligands. We employed a suite of characterization techniques (transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, voltammetry, and thermogravimetric analysis) to evaluate their surface chemistry. Although the four studied treatments (bases, alkylating agents, Lewis acids, or heat) could remove nearly all organic ligands, the surface chemistries of the treated nanomaterials differed significantly from treatment to treatment. These chemical differences arise from the reactions between the treatment agent and the surfactant or from side reactions of the agent with atmospheric water or carbon dioxide, leaving behind residues, such as hydrolyzed ligand removal agent, metal hydroxide, and metal carbonate, on the surface. From our study, we find that treatment using alkylating agents is the most promising approach for soft room-temperature stripping of nanocrystal ligands, producing Mn3O4 with the highest electrochemical activity.",

For demonstration, a polarized piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is used as a separator. When the film is deformed by any local protrusion because of surface instability of the deposited lithium, a local piezoelectric over-potential is generated to suppress lithium deposition on the protrusion. Our optical in situ cell shows that a polarized PVDF film ensures lithium metal depositing to form a flat surface, even when starting from an uneven surface. In contrast, a nonpolarized PVDF film cannot suppress dendrite growth under the same condition, with dendrite penetrating the separator within minutes. Coin cell results further confirm that the piezoelectric mechanism is effective in practical battery applications. Analysis suggests that the effectiveness of piezoelectric mechanism by over-potential is easily 104 stronger than the maximum physical limit of mechanical blocking from infinitely stiff blocking materials, suggesting a new direction of material innovation.",

This material exhibited a remarkable methane uptake per unit surface area, which outperformed those of most reported porous organic materials. Variable-temperature thermodynamic adsorption measurements corroborated the significantly less negative entropy penalty during high-pressure gas adsorption, compared to its non-ladder-type counterpart.

A Kissinger analysis of variable ramp rate desorption experiments estimates the enthalpy of H2 desorption from Cu(I) at 15 kJ mol–1. The results represent an advance toward practical H2 storage and delivery in a lightweight, stable, and highly versatile material.",

    "abstract": "On-surface synthesis has been developed into a promising research field for fabricating low-dimensional materials with great potential in tailoring structures, functionality, and, thus, desired chemical and physical properties. Thus far, most surface-assisted reactions are conducted on single-crystal metal surfaces, which serve as catalysts. However, the metal surface severely quenches the intrinsic electronic or optical properties of the adsorbed functional material. In view of potential applications, in particular device fabrication, direct integration of functional molecular systems on technologically relevant insulating or semiconducting surfaces is highly desirable. Recently, significant efforts have been made toward realizing chemical reactions on nonmetallic substrates; however, details of their catalytic mechanisms are still unclear and require further investigation. On the other hand, various approaches have been demonstrated to replace the catalytic functionality of metals with, for example, photochemistry or direct tip manipulation. In this Perspective, we review early advances in this field of nonmetallic surface confined reactions and highlight upcoming opportunities and challenges. We start by describing recent advances in reaction types, followed by presenting various external catalytic methods and end with pointing out promising future directions.",

    "abstract": "The difficulties encountered in finding proper anode materials with high capacities and rate capabilities are a prime obstacle hindering the realization of high-performance K-ion batteries (KIBs). Electrodes undergoing reversible conversion-alloying reactions with K-ions could offer much higher capacities than traditional intercalation-based anodes, while the available candidates remain rather limited. Herein, high-performance metal chalcogenides (MCs) are explored through descriptor-assisted theoretical screening. Among potential candidates for metal constituents of MCs, thermodynamically stable Bi and Sb are chosen based on density functional theory calculations: while Sb possesses a significantly higher theoretical capacity than Bi, Bi presents better cyclic stability and lower electrochemical potentials than Sb. In addition, chalcogens with high atomic numbers favor K-diffusion kinetics in terms of diffusion barrier and K vacancy formation energy. Taking into account the relative merits and weaknesses, layer-structured SbBiTe3 is identified as the choice anode. Even without elaborate design of electrode morphologies using a complicated fabrication method, the SbBiTe3/graphite anode prepared by a simple and scalable ball-milling strategy delivers a remarkable capacity of 202 mAhg–1 after prolonged 1000 cycles at 80 mAg–1 with Coulombic efficiencies consistently higher than 99%, signifying its intrinsically excellent electrochemical performance compared to other electrode materials. The unique approach developed here uncovers new possibilities in search of advanced anodes and sheds light on the development of high-performance KIBs based on theoretical exploration.",

We report here the fabrication of supramolecular plastics displaying excellent dry-flexibility and mechanical strength through room-temperature solid-phase molecular self-assembly using water-locking polyelectrolyte and surfactant. Aided by mild mechanical pressure of about 0.5 MPa, the locked water enables the polyelectrolyte-bridged surfactant microdomains to merge into large mesophases to reduce the interface energy, which yields a transparent supramolecular film. The film still contains 2% water in a dry environment, which is capable of plasticizing the polyelectrolyte and surfactant; thus, it imparts excellent flexibility to the film. The dry film has a stress of 12 MPa and Young's modulus of 188 MPa with a strain of 24%. This mechanical strength is comparable to that of the commercial soft polyethylene plastics. Since the noncovalent interactions in the film can be activated by water under mild mechanical pressure within seconds, mending a broken film by pressing a wet patch with mild mechanical force onto the damage becomes possible. Complete recycling can be achieved under the same conditions. We envision the current room-temperature mechanical force driven water-based recyclable and mendable supramolecular plastics would be very promising in reducing white pollution and generating integrated materials.",

Recent research has focused on finding new materials with active basal planes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that the hexagonal vdW Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), also a spintronic candidate material, shows both basal plane and edge site HER activities. Partial exfoliation of bulk FGT through sonication increases both basal plane and edge sites leading to significantly improved overpotential. A subsequent compacting of the sample (using plasma sintering at room temperature) to produce a densified electrode leads to an impressive overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2 of −0.105 V. DFT free energy calculations not only showed that the high activity is due to the abundant active sites present on the hexagonal Te layer in FGT but also presented an even more HER active layer (106) containing both iron and tellurium active sites. Furthermore, the presence of a thin oxide layer on top of the active FGT layers, as found by XPS, suggests that the real active surface is likely a hybrid FGT/oxide layer. These results demonstrate the high basal plane and edge sites HER activity of FGT, thus opening a new avenue for the design and screening of related iron-based vdW materials, their composites, and their surface functionalization as high-performing electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Materials for hydrogen storage have been extensively explored for a few decades. Thousands of materials have been synthesized and tested; however, few systems could meet the practical requirements. Metalorganic hydrides discovered recently offer new opportunities. It is, however, extremely time-consuming and inefficient to experimentally screen potential materials from a large variety of metal cations and organic anions. In the present study, we performed wide-ranging theoretical predictions and screened more than 90 metalorganic hydrides; 20 of them were identified with both high hydrogen capacities (≥5 wt %) and suitable thermodynamics (heat of H2 desorption: 25–35 kJ/mol-H2) that allow hydrogen uptake and release near ambient condition. We picked up four of them, i.e., Li/Na indolides and 7-azaindolides, for experimental validation. All the four candidates can be easily synthesized via the reactions between the metal hydrides and the corresponding organic precursors. Among them the structures of lithium indolide (P21/c (no. 14)) and sodium 7-azaindolide (P4̅21c (no. 114) were successfully resolved. Photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations confirmed that the charge density of the organic ring increased with the introduction of an alkali metal, thus optimizing their ΔHd for hydrogen storage. Importantly, we demonstrated experimentally that lithium indolide with a theoretical hydrogen capacity of 6.1 wt % has a heat of hydrogen absorption of ca. 33.7 kJ/mol-H2 which is in excellent agreement with the value (33.6 kJ/mol-H2) predicted theoretically. The partially reversible hydrogen release and uptake can be can be achieved at the temperature as low as 100 °C. These results illustrate the great potential of metalorganic hydrides for tackling the grand challenge of hydrogen storage and manifest the effectiveness of theoretical prediction in guiding materials fabrication.",

    "abstract": "Strain sensors, as a key component of wearable/stretchable electronics, typically exhibit an intrinsic conflict between large strain (>100%) and high sensitivity (gauge factor > 10). This Letter reports a solution to this trade-off by creating a high-conductivity thin layer of polyaniline (PANi) percolated through the outer surface of a polymethyl acrylate organogel. The highly robust, conductive organogel can achieve both high gauge factor and large strain via the mismatch between the fragile PANi and the elastic polyacrylate blending layer. The high gauge factor over the entire strain range of 2000% enables its broad sensing range from human pulse to massive deformation. The water-free conductive organogel provides purely electronic conductivity and allows for working under extreme conditions, which typical conductive hydrogels cannot withstand. These merits allows the sensor to present high sensitivity for both subtle movement (8% resistance change for pulse detection) and large strain (a gauge factor of 376 at 460% strain). Such a conductive organogel also demonstrated great sustainability under harsh operating conditions, as demonstrated by a dielectric elastomer actuator based on it, capable of generating a horizontal displacement of 15.7 mm (46% of the total length) at −12 °C, as a substitute for conventional hydrogels as the electrode.",

To address this issue, tin halide perovskite NCs have been pushed to the forefront of perovskite research owing to their eco-friendly merit and tantalizing photophysical properties. In this Review, we critically summarize and assess the latest advances in the synthesis approaches of tin halide perovskite NCs including the hot injection, ligand-assisted reprecipitation, and chemical vapor deposition. More specifically, we detail the state-of-the-art preliminary studies in modulating their photophysical properties and in enhancing the stability with a variety of strategies such as precursor engineering, ligand engineering, and alloyed structure construction. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges that need to be overcome to attain tin halide perovskite NCs with clear structure–property relationships and comparable physical and chemical properties to their lead-based cousins.",

    "abstract": "There is a critical need for energy-efficient water treatment processes as the world seeks to limit global warming below 1.5 °C. Gravity-driven mesh filtration presents a sustainable solution to treating oily wastewater and emulsions, which are byproducts of many human activities. The promise of a green alternative is getting closer with the development of 3D printing combined with reusable, recyclable, and ubiquitous materials such as silica to produce durable and recyclable filters with controllable mesh spacing. In this work, several filters were fabricated to separate oily water mixtures with a separation efficiency of 99% at high flow flux by coating 3D porous ceramic architectures with organosilanes. The proposed ceramic filters can also treat oil-in-water and water-in-oil surfactant-stabilized emulsions with high flow flux. This strategy to functionalize the 3D printed silica surface to form either hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces can open a new possibility for gravity-driven simultaneous oil–water separation. The first gravity-driven hierarchical auto-oil–water separator (HAOS) was introduced to separate an oily water mixture into two different containers using a combination of 3D printed hierarchical hydrophilic and hydrophobic filters without an additional postseparation step.",

While hydrogen bonds gave the aramid precursor unattractive separation performance, they were leveraged to provide aramid-derived CMS membranes with ultrahigh H2/CO2 selectivity exceeding all known CMS membranes. Adsorption in aramid-derived CMS membranes suggested their ultrahigh H2/CO2 selectivity was attributable to diffusion selectivity above 3000. The excellent solution processability of uncrosslinked aramids allowed the fabrication of scalable CMS hollow fiber membranes. The findings of this work open the door to a new class of highly selective CMS membranes for H2 separation and CO2 capture.",

Motivated by the recent synthesis of high-performance Na4MnCr(PO4)3(NMCP) [Zhang et al. Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 1906348] that exhibits a reversible three-electron process with a high energy density of 566.5 Wh/kg, we provide an in-depth theoretical study on the underlying mechanisms of ion diffusion and stability for a better understanding of the experimental results. We self-consistently calculate the Hubbard U parameters for Mn and Cr in the NMCP system using the linear response approach and successfully reproduce the three voltage plateaus observed in the experiment. At the low voltage plateau, the Na+ ions diffuse with both concerted and stepwise migration mechanisms, and the corresponding energy barrier is 0.18 and 0.21 eV. The synergy of these two mechanisms results in fast diffusion kinetics for the Na ion in NMCP. Besides, the redox couples of Mn2+/Mn3+, Mn3+/Mn4+, and Cr3+/Cr4+ are confirmed theoretically in good agreement with the experiment. Despite the distinct changes of O-2p states during the charging/discharging process, the NASICON framework of NMCP withstands the formations of O2 or (O2)2–, thus exhibiting high stability. Especially, we have identified the locking effect of Na+ ions at low Na+ concentration due to the large site energy difference and weak concerted migration, which can be effectively modulated by enlarging the lattice constants to improve the performance of NMCP during cycling.",

Here, a combination of crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations predicts a metal-decoration-free Li3C2 monolayer that exhibits a hydrogen storage capacity of 8.2 wt % and high average hydrogen desorption temperature of 286 K. Li3C2 monolayer is constructed by two hexagonal Li layers sandwiched with Li–C layers containing a C dimer. Interestingly, each C atom binds with six neighboring Li atoms and one C atom, forming a quasi-planar heptacoordinate carbon moiety. Li3C2 monolayer can adsorb up 2 H2 molecules with the average adsorption energy of 0.22 eV/H2, suitable for reversible hydrogen storage. Analysis suggests that the hybridization of Li sp and H s orbitals plays a key role in hydrogen adsorption. Moreover, the exploration of the effect of temperature and pressure on hydrogen storage performance of Li3C2 monolayer shows that, at room temperature, all adsorbed hydrogen structures are stable at pressure of 40 bar. The calculated van't Hoff desorption temperatures and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the realization of hydrogen desorption at near room temperature and the effectiveness of hydrogen storage/release cycles. In addition, we provide a possible route to experimentally grow Li3C2 monolayer on suitable substrates, such as the Cu(111) surface and graphene.",

The lysosomal events (i.e., fission, fusion, and kiss-and-run events) were observed with the BSA–NCs under SIM, as was the interplay between lysosomes and mitochondria leading to mitophagy. With their molecular-like properties and near-infrared fluorescence, BSA–Au NCs proved able to enter the internal cells of organoids and, for the first time, were applied to track subcellular lysosomal dynamics.

However, to become better optical labels that are more suitable for biological applications, LnNPs must overcome their inherent flaws, including original hydrophobic surface, insufficient luminescence intensity, as well as the low environmental responsiveness. Recently, researchers have achieved extraordinary results in ameliorating these defects through ligand-based surface engineering. In this Review, we discussed several representative methods for the hydrophilic modification of LnNPs. Then, the significant attempts for luminescence amplification of LnNPs were concluded. Subsequently, attentions were paid to the methods that helped to fabricate responsive LnNPs systems, as well as the potential biomedical applications. Finally, we considered the current limitations and prospects of the surface engineering strategies for LnNPs.

Herein, we report a novel bridging and fixing strategy for retaining the ordered arrangement of MOCs. In the bridging process, electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions involving the 4,6-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate (m-DOBDC2–) ligands of cuboctahedral MOCs and formaldehyde connect the cages by methylene bridges, which are among the shortest linkers. In the subsequent fixing process, pore-filling and coordinating solvents are exchanged with or removed by low surface tension, noncoordinating solvents (such as mesitylene) in which MOCs are poorly soluble. This mild activation process avoids altering the cage arrangement, thereby further increasing the porosity of the bridged MOCs. The general applicability of this fixing process is demonstrated using cuboctahedral MOCs with different functional groups. As a result, after the fixing process, MOP-1-H displays the highest surface area of 1090.7 m2/g among Cu-paddlewheel-based MOCs. This study extends the potential applications of MOCs as functional porous materials by providing a simple and pragmatic method for preserving their porosities.",

Probiotic therapy displays great advantages to combat infection by regulating the wound flora balance, compared with biocidal-based wound dressing. However, probiotic therapy has large obstacle and potential biosafety risks for proper application. Herein, a probiotic-free wound dressing for accelerating wound healing is reported to regulate wound flora balance without inoculating microorganisms at the wound. A poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) (PMP) microfiber membrane exhibits strong bacterial adhesion (1.74 × 109 CFU/cm2), and bacterial adhesion count correlates with the surface energy and fiber diameter of PMP microfiber membranes. The efficient bacterial adhesion of the PMP microfiber membrane endows the ability to regulate wound flora for accelerating the healing. Pathogenic bacteria could be removed from the infectious wound through dressing change, so the concentration of pathogenic bacteria at the wound could be kept at a low level, which is beneficial to wound healing. Based on the rat model, wounds have the lowest bacterial concentration and a fast healing rate after treatment with a PMP microfiber membrane, compared with the group treated with commercial dressings. These results reveal that the PMP microfiber membrane could be used to accelerate infectious wound healing by regulating wound flora balance.

The free-standing thick electrode is a promising candidate among the state-of-art electrodes, since it has the advantages of high areal mass, binder-free, current-collector-free, and no carbon additive; thus, the whole mass of the electrode is an active material that can contribute to capacity. However, enhancing areal density by introducing thick electrodes impinges on the transport of charge carriers including ions and electrons. Here we designed and synthesized an ultrathick (1500 μm) free-standing foam, which is a carbon framework with 1T-MoS2 nanosheets embedded in the vertically aligned channel wall. To tune the areal mass and morphology of the as-obtained foam, a confined iterative self-assembly strategy was proposed. The Na+ storage behavior was studied by using the as-obtained foam as a free-standing electrode against Na metal. Consequently, it displays good cycle stability even with a high areal mass of 20.74 mg cm–2 and delivers an astonishing reversible areal capacity of 19.75 mAh cm–2 at 0.01 A g–1, which greatly exceeds that of most sodium storage materials.

Film of the PNDI2T-1, in which each NDI unit is attached with one linear and one branching alkyl chains, exhibits higher electrical conductivity and a greater power factor (PF) than those of PNDI2T-2 with the same conjugated backbone and two branching side chains, after doping with either (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI) or decahydro-3a,6a,9a-triazaphenalene (TAM) under the same conditions. The optimal PF values of the doped films of PNDI2T-1 with N-DMBI and TAM can reach 1.6 and 3.5 μW m–1K–2, respectively, which are among the highest reported TE performances for NDI-based semiconducting polymers after n-doping. The higher TE performance of the doped films of PNDI2T-1 is attributed to the enhancement of charge mobility and improvement of doping degree after side-chain modification.

A bimetallic MOF, namely BUT-85 (BUT = Beijing University of Technology), has been successfully synthesized with a rationally designed pyrazolate-carboxylate ligand. Its robust [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3]n chain (Pz = pyrazolate) with bridging OH–/H2O and pyrazolate groups is reported for the first time. This material shows good chemical stability in water and aqueous solutions with a pH range from 3 to 13. In addition, BUT-85 exhibits preferential adsorption behavior of C2H2 over CO2. It is proposed to be attributed to the abundant exposed bridging OH–/H2O sites in [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3]n chains, which is supported by the results of molecular simulations. Column breakthrough experiments further confirm that this MOF can realize efficient C2H2/CO2 separation. This strategy can not only enrich the structural library of MOFs but also optimize their properties and functions for promoting applications.",

Low-dimensional perovskite structures have aroused great attention recently for its unique properties such as large carrier mobility and anisotropic properties. However, there are lack of methods to grow high-quality and large-size low-dimensional perovskite single crystals. Herein, by using ethylene glycol as solvent to increase the coordination between precursor and solutes, the nucleation barrier is increased allowing slow nucleation and crystal growth. As a result, large-size two-dimensional (2D) tin perovskite single crystals with smooth surface are synthesized for the first time. A photodetector is fabricated based on this single crystal and it shows linear-polarized light sensing. The theoretical simulation is explored to explain the anisotropic properties of 2D perovskite structures. In the end, a heterojunction is fabricated based on the epitaxy growth of 2D lead perovskite on the 2D tin perovskite single crystal.",

Highly porous and nonfriable conductive carbon foams were prepared, and bismuth was electrodeposited to provide strong iodine binding sites. For pure carbon foams, equal ratios of physisorbed and chemisorbed iodine–carbon phases were detected before desorption. As the concentration of bismuth increased, the chemisorption between bismuth and iodine dominated the total capture mechanism, and physisorption was almost completely eliminated. Additionally, chemisorption of iodine depended upon the size and specific surface area of the bismuth clusters present within the framework of the foam.",

Starting from the non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) BTP-4Cl-C9-12, two NFAs named BTP-4Cl-C9-16 and BTP-4Cl-C9-20 with the alkyl chains of 2-ethylhexyl and 2-octyldodecyl attached on the pyrrole rings are synthesized in this work. Through molecular dynamics simulations and experimental characterizations, we show that favorable three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb networks, which are beneficial for charge transport, can be formed in NFAs with the moderate alkyl chain length (BTP-4Cl-C9-12 and BTP-4Cl-C9-16), while two-dimensional honeycomb networks form in BTP-4Cl-C9-20 with long alkyl chains. 1,8-Diiodooctane solvent molecules adsorb on all alkyl chains of NFAs, reducing the adsorption energy between NFAs to promote their intermolecular interactions, especially in NFAs with longer alkyl chains. As a result, the synergistic effect of the 3D network and the appropriate domain size leads to a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.0% and 15.9% in thin- (100 nm) and thick- (300 nm) PM6:BTP-4Cl-C9-16 binary OSCs.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of stretchable, leak-free, and highly conductive gallium-based bioelectronic devices with exceptional biostability and electrochemical properties. We first utilized unique gallium oxide properties to create 3D microscale wrinkled structures on the gallium surface. Then, gold nanoparticles and biostable poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) were successively deposited on the wrinkled liquid metal surface. We demonstrated this multilayer encapsulation material could conform to the stretching deformation and showed excellent environmental stabilities while maintaining high electrical properties. Electromyographic measurements were used to evaluate the bioelectrical performance of the stretchable electronics, and the results demonstrated the encapsulated liquid metal device could outperform bare liquid metal devices. Finally, a sensory feedback study demonstrated our liquid metal bioelectronic device could record precise physiologic signals to control robots for mimicking dexterous hand gestures. This study opens the possibility of chronic liquid-metal-based stretchable bioelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Interlayers play a vital role in achieving high efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs). Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been widely used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted OSCs; however, its high structural defects and intrinsic photocatalytic nature toward nonfullerene acceptors limit its applications in OSCs. Herein, a low-cost, environmentally-friendly biomolecule, potassium aspartic acid (PAA), is introduced as the interlayer on top of the ZnO ETL. Through experimental results and theoretical calculations, we find PAA not only can tune energy alignments and passivate oxygen vacancy defects and zinc interstitial dangling bonds but also can promote the π–π stacking strength of the active layer, leading to enhanced charge collection and photovoltaic performance in both IT series (e.g., PM6:IT-4F) and Y series (e.g., PM6:BTP-4F-C5-16) OSCs. Moreover, benefiting from the reduced surface defects of ZnO, OSCs based upon the ZnO/PAA ETL exhibit superior stabilities under continuous operation as well as UV-light irradiation, leading to an improved T80 lifetime of around 4 times compared to OSCs fabricated without the PAA interlayer. This work provides a universal solution to fabricate efficient and stable inverted OSCs.",

    "abstract": "Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a kind of tumor that is difficult to treat by chemotherapy alone. In recent years, various studies have been conducted on the use of multifunctional nanoparticles with core@shell or indiscriminate coassembly to improve therapeutic efficacy. However, in these multifunctional nanoformulations, the functional subunits are located in the relevant space, in which the different functions are difficult to perform independently during the combination therapy. Herein, the enwinding-structured asymmetric mesoporous Fe3O4&mSiO2–SRF nanoformulation (SRF = Sorafenib) is constructed for the combination therapy of STS, in which the one-dimensional mSiO2 nanorods are enwound on the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In this enwinding-structured asymmetric nanoformulation, a Fe3O4 nanosphere subunit is used for the chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and a mesoporous SiO2 (mSiO2) subunit with high surface area is used for the loading of SRF chemotherapy drugs (mSiO2–SRF). Taking advantage of the spatial isolation of mSiO2–SRF and Fe3O4 subunits, the direct exposure of the Fe3O4 subunit can not only enhance the Fenton reaction on the nanoparticles surface but also accelerate the release of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the acidic microenvironment of the tumor, which further induced the upgrade of the cell oxidation level through GSH consumption and CDT. In addition, the SRF loaded mSiO2 functional unit can inhibit the synthesis of GSH, and synergistically work with the Fe3O4 functional unit to enhance the ferroptosis of cancer cells. Compared with traditional core@shell structured nanoformulation, the cancer cell killing efficiency of the asymmetric mesoporous nanoformulation is greatly increased by 41.33%, thus realizing improved tumor restrain efficiency in STS treatment.",

    "abstract": "Compared to zero-dimensional (0D) semiconductor quantum dots, 2D semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) offer a spectrally narrow luminescence and superior absorption coefficients, which makes this geometry an attractive candidate for optoelectronic applications. However, optical devices based on NPLs still suffer from nonradiative Auger decay of multiple excitons (MX), which limits the efficiency of the processes, including MX luminescence, electroluminescence, and optical gain. Here, we demonstrate that Auger recombination is strongly suppressed in spherically shaped nanoplatelets, called quantum shells (QSs), where a relaxed confinement of charges leads to diminished exciton–exciton interactions. In particular, we use single photon counting and photon correlation spectroscopy to show that two-dimensional CdS/CdSe/CdS core/shell/shell spherical QSs reach near-unity biexciton emission yield. The Auger suppression was found most prominent in QSs with the largest shell diameter. A combination of ultralong (>15 ns) biexciton (BX) emission lifetimes and strong exciton–exciton repulsion in these QS samples allowed demonstrating low-threshold amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), large modal gain, and microcavity lasing featuring sharp emission modes at the BX and MX transitions. Finally, by introducing QSs within perovskite matrices, we achieved a strong electroluminescence enhancement in light-emitting devices, yielding devices as bright as 213 W/m2 and a 2.3-fold enhancement of the maximum external quantum efficiency. These results represent a major step toward realizing solution-processed colloidal lasers and LEDs.",

Here, we presented the first case of applying metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new material platform to construct a TL dosimeter.

The crystalline nature of MOFs associated with unambiguous structural information enables TL mechanism elucidation by theoretical calculations, which indicate that in SCU-300 the stable free radicals responsible for emitting visible light when heated are attributed to the charge transform (CT) from the anionic carboxyl groups to the centrosymmetric benzene ring. Furthermore, micron-sized SCU-300 single crystals were subjected to a point dose monitoring experiment based on a simulated eyeball model, and the measured doses match well (error <4%) with those by Monte Carlo calculations.",

Here, a microneedle platform combining a PEG-based supramolecular polymer network with a mechanical biopolymer network is able to penetrate the skin, where the microneedles subsequently swell; those composed of supramolecular cross-links detach upon device removal. The embedded supramolecular microneedles afford sustained delivery of insulin for >12 h of blood glucose correction following only 5 min of skin application.

    "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, chromium tellurides (Cr1+δTe2), with room temperature ferromagnetism and exotic topological spin textures, have emerged as an attractive platform for the development of ultrathin spintronic devices. While many prior studies claim Cr1+δTe2 are air-stable, which is crucial for practical applications, we demonstrate that within only minutes of exposure to air dramatic changes occur in the Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra of nanoplates at room temperature. Time-dependent magnetization measurements and transmission electron microscopy studies suggested the rapid oxidation is not self-limited and has distinct processes on the surfaces and edges. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the spontaneous oxygen adsorption on the surface and the thermodynamically favorable oxidation process. These findings demonstrate unambiguously that the surface of Cr1+δTe2 is extremely air-sensitive, highlighting the necessity of surface protection for fundamental studies of intrinsic 2D magnetism and practical applications of advanced spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Cancer treatments that combine chemotherapy with immunotherapy are becoming increasingly effective, but chemotherapy is generally considered to have immunosuppressive effects. Moreover, tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents is insufficient and the rate of persistent response to checkpoint blockade therapy is low, leading to tumor treatment failure. Here, we developed a transition-enhanced immunomodulation (TEI) effect to construct a self-assembled peptide TpYCR for drug delivery with stepwise targeting of tumor cells and mitochondria. Doxorubicin (DOX)/TpYCR first targeted tumor cells, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the tumor microenvironment induced their conversion from nanoparticles (NPs) to nanofibers (NFs) with concomitant release of DOX. Subsequently, intracellular overexpression of reduced glutathione (GSH) induced their formation into hydrogels, increasing the intracellular retention of DOX and sustainably inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Importantly, DOX/TpYCR inhibited Treg cells, activated DC cells, and stimulated immunogenic factor expression to produce a lasting immune response. Combined PD-1 inhibitor treatment and chemotherapy further improved the response rate to immunosuppressive agents, produced synergistic effects, and ultimately inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. This study sheds new light on the development of self-assembled peptide nanocarriers for immunomodulatory therapy.",

Specifically, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was surface-modified with RFH nanoparticles (R848-loaded Fe-TCPP metal–organic framework nanoparticles coated with hyaluronic acid) via covalent borate ester bonds to prepare Bac@RFH bioconsumer, which could specifically target and colonize in tumors to efficiently metabolize intratumoral lactate and concurrently trigger the reduction of the Fe3+ moieties of RFH through bacteria-mediated electron transfer, resulting in the decomposition of RFH to release Fe2+ and R848. Moreover, the overexpressed H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was catalyzed by the Fe2+-driven Fenton reaction to produce cytotoxic ROS, which elicited immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, resulting in DCs maturation and effector T cells activation to eliminate tumors. With the combination of R848-mediated immune activation, Bac@RFH could significantly reshape the immunosuppressive TME for boosting antitumor immunity, such as reducing the recruitment of Tregs and MDSCs as well as promoting the M2-to-M1 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. In addition, the synergy of Bac@RFH and αPD-1 could evoke robust immune responses to suppress tumor growth and achieve a tumor suppression rate over 90%, which represents a smart strategy to potentiate antitumor immunotherapy via bacterium-based metabolic regulation.",

However, it is challenging to incorporate these exciting materials into functional devices because of the difficulty in synthesizing the frameworks directly on desired substrates and at a scale suitable for mass distribution with a controlled morphology. Electrosynthesis can provide a means that is both scalable and synthetically controllable by which metal–organic frameworks can be grown directly on targeted substrates for use in electronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate the electrosynthesis of an EC-MOF constructed with nickel and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene, namely Ni-HHTP, with distinct disc and flower-like morphologies (Ni-HHTP-Disc and Ni-HHTP-Flower) by varying the ligand concentrations. The electrochemical performance of Ni-HHTP-Flower greatly exceeds that of bulk Ni-HHTP, boasting gravimetric capacitances and electrochemically active surface areas up to 10 times that of the bulk material because of mesoporous features absent in the bulk, showcasing electrosynthesis as a promising method for preparing future EC-MOF-based devices.",

The crumpled electrode design is a promising avenue for stretchable batteries by providing sufficient internal space to accommodate tensile deformations. Current electrodes typically have rough surfaces with visible corrugations, which present practical challenges in assembling compact cells for wearable systems. In this study, we report the design and preparation of ultrastretchable electrodes with microwrinkled surface textures. Crumpled electrodes are created in a transfer-printing process based on active materials deposited on metal film current collectors. A polymer membrane is introduced as a key mechanical support to effectively enhance the durability of these electrodes against large and repetitive tensile strains. A stretchable pouch cell of Zn-MnO2 rechargeable battery is constructed with a total thickness of ∼1 mm. The battery cell demonstrates a high specific capacity of 211 mAh g–1, stable charge–discharge cycling performances, and ultrahigh deformability of up to 525% strain. The compact design allows the battery to achieve conformal attachment to the skin and versatile integration with various deformable systems.

However, the question remains as to whether any type of 2D perovskite, i.e., RP, DJ, or ACI perovskites, is workable with a 3D analog to outperform the pristine 3D perovskites. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of distinct types of 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions based on first-principles calculations. We selected a 3D FAPbI3 perovskite combined with representative 2D RP, DJ, and ACI perovskites to construct a series of 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions and analyzed the carrier transport kinetics and charge recombination of each heterojunction. The results indicate that RP-PbI, DJ-FAI, and ACI-FAI heterojunctions exhibited favorable transport and separation of photogenerated carriers, but the RP-PbI and ACI-FAI heterojunctions appear to possess greater potential for photovoltaic applications than the DJ-FAI heterojunction due to relatively fewer recombination losses. Moreover, based on the direction of photogenerated carrier transport at the heterojunction, we predict that RP-PbI would be superior to DJ-FAI for conventional 2D/3D devices and that the ACI-FAI heterojunction is expected to well function in the inverted 2D/3D devices.",

Although various carbon-based materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes have been extensively used as secondary sintering additives to develop advanced ceramics with improved mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, the potential of MOF-derived nanocarbon-based materials has not been explored. Here, we report the first use of MOF-derived nanocarbons as a reinforcement phase in ceramic composites. To this end, Al2O3 and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) are used as the ceramic matrix and nanocarbon source, respectively. The ceramic composites are produced by densifying Al2O3 and ZIF-8 powder mixtures using spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1550 °C and uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa. The fracture toughness of the composite increases up to 67% in comparison to an alumina monolith as ZIF-derived nanocarbons form interlayers to assist the dissipation of energy during the crack propagation and inhibit grain growth. The room-temperature electrical conductivity of the sintered samples drastically increases with the in situ formed nanocarbon-based fillers, reaching as high as 1410 S/m for 10 wt % ZIF-8 content. These results constitute an excellent initial step toward boosting the mechanical and electrical properties of ceramic matrix composites with in situ MOF-derived nanocarbons.",

The energy and power densities of Na superionic conductor (NaSICON) electrode materials are promising for large-scale energy storage applications. However, several practical issues limit the full utilization of the theoretical energy densities of the NaSICON electrodes. A pressing challenge lies in the limited sodium extraction in low Na content NaSICONs, e.g., Na1VIVVIV(PO4)3 ↔ VVVIV(PO4)3 + e– + Na+. Therefore, it is important to quantify the Na-ion mobility in a broad range of NaSICON electrodes. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach bearing the accuracy of first-principles calculations, we elucidate the variability of Na-ion transport vs Na content in three important NaSICON electrode materials, NaxTi2(PO4)3, NaxV2(PO4)3, and NaxCr2(PO4)3. We show Na+ transport in NaSICON electrode materials is almost entirely determined by the local electrostatic and chemical environment set by the transition metals and the polyanionic scaffold. The competition with the ordering-disordering phenomena of Na vacancies also plays a role in influencing Na transport. We identify the Na content providing the highest room-temperature diffusivities in these electrodes, i.e., Na2.7Ti2(PO4)3, Na2.9V2(PO4)3, and Na2.6Cr2(PO4)3. We link the variations in the Na+ kinetic properties by analyzing the competition of ligand field stabilization transition metal ions and their ionic radii. We interpret the limited Na extraction at x = 1 observed experimentally by gaining insights into the local Na vacancy interplay. Targeted chemical substitutions of transition metals disrupting local charge arrangements will be critical to reducing the occurrence of strong Na+-vacancy orderings at low Na concentrations, thus expanding the accessible capacities of these electrode materials.",

Herein, we propose Mn vacancy-modulated 2D manganese oxide nanobelts (V-MnO2) for high-performance zinc-ion storage. The Mn vacancies not only promote the metallicity of V-MnO2 exhibiting an energy gap of 0.25 eV but also accelerate zinc ion transport with a diffusion coefficient as high as 10–11 cm2 s–1. Based on EXAFS and DFT calculations, the presence of Mn vacancies has led to local lattice distortions and charge redistribution, which could mitigate electrostatic interactions and increase structural stability while providing additional ion host sites. As expected, a high reversible capacity of 261.8 mAh g–1 and a maximum energy density of 343.3 Wh kg–1 can be achieved for V-MnO2, as well as an excellent long-term cycling stability of 71.5% retention after 1500 cycles.

Here, we investigate the impact of typical defects such as single vacancies, double vacancies, and ring defects on the electronic structures of 2D COFs, taking COF-C4N and TANG-COF as representative examples. To facilitate the modeling of extensive systems with defect densities ranging from 1.25% to 25%, i.e., values on the order of those found experimentally, we rely on efficient density functional-based tight binding methods. In the presence of vacancies and ring defects, the 2D COFs still exhibit semiconducting characteristics with bandgap values that remain close to those of the corresponding perfect configurations. However, the different types of defects bring different modifications to the electronic structure: Vacancy defect levels are found to be primarily located near the top of the valence bands and occupied, while ring defect levels are situated just below the bottom of the conduction bands and unoccupied. Our study of how defects impact the electronic properties of 2D COFs provides valuable insight for future explorations of defect engineering in COFs.",

Diverging from the conventional field-free designs utilizing symmetric exchange interaction, this Letter explores the use of antisymmetric interlayer Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (i-DMI), which facilitates the emergence of noncollinear chiral spin configurations with wedge deposition. This work reveals a clear oscillatory behavior of the i-DMI strength with varying capping layer thickness, aligning with Bruno's model. The strong i-DMI and sizable SOT efficiency observed in an optimized CoFeB/Pt(thick)/Co/Pt(thin) heterostructure result in a zero thermal critical switching current density of 1.67 × 1011 A/m2 and a thermal stability factor of 48.7, indicating the potential of such multilayer design for last-level cache memory applications. A counter-deposition method is also proposed to tackle the thickness variation issue caused by wedge deposition, offering a practical solution for implementing this field-free switching method.",

The BSP-PNS@CMCS dressings are designed with an inner layer of Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) sponges for initial hemostasis and an outer dense layer of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) hydrogels loaded with panax notoginseng saponines (PNS) for angiogenesis during subsequent tissue reconstruction. Through in vivo experiments, we have demonstrated that the BSP-PNS@CMCS dressings could not only significantly reduce bleeding in rat liver-puncture hemorrhage wounds but also accelerate wound closure by suppressing the inflammatory response, promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition in infected skin wounds of rats. In vitro and in vivo results indicate that such asymmetric double-layer BSP-PNS@CMCS dressing could be a prospective candidate for the stepwise treatment of hemorrhagic wounds, which also provides an effective strategy for other tissue repair applications.",

However, a lack of guiding principles makes it challenging. Herein, two COFs (DhaTAT and DhaTAB) are prepared and demonstrated to work excellently for the adsorption and removal of the representative environmental pollutant phenanthrene (PHE) with the highest adsorption capacity and the fastest adsorption kinetics reported so far. Although having comparable PHE adsorption performances, DhaTAT displays much better reusability than DhaTAB. By deeply exploring the underlying mechanism, we reveal for the first time the adverse effects of adsorption-induced deformation phenomenon on the crystallinity, morphology, specific surface area, and thus reusability of COFs, and propose that introducing electron-withdrawing groups can alleviate this phenomenon and endow COF-based adsorbents with excellent reusability. Such a prediction is further confirmed by the recycling performances of two new COFs (DapTFB and DanTFB) that are designed under the guidance of theoretical calculations. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of adsorption-induced deformation on the practical application potential of COFs, which is crucial for the development of new materials with stable adsorption performance and good reusability.",

This work reports on a process for fabricating indefinitely long multimaterial polymer fibers that can be doped with different organic–inorganic hybrid emitters, such as Cs3Cu2I5 nanoparticles, Cu2I2 nanoclusters, and Mn-doped Cs4CdBi2Cl12 phosphors. This versatility allows for the creation of fibers with tunable emission colors, which enable the realization of large-area, high-performance scintillation surfaces by additive manufacturing, weaving, or rolling. These conformal scintillator screens have been used to demonstrate X-ray imaging of nonplanar complex shapes without the image distortion and resolution degradation associated with rigid planar scintillator configurations. Additive manufacturing of sophisticated three-dimensional scintillators with nanoemitters offers opportunities for personalized medical imaging platforms, particularly for breast cancer screening, as well as applications in large-area high-energy radiation and particle detection.",

Electrochemical tests show that FGSSE has excellent oxidative stability exceeding 5.5 V and improved conductivity (>7 times of an analogous HMSSE).

By inserting a trace amount of Au between two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNN) and MoS2, we have successfully constructed a CNN/Au/MoS2 ternary hybrid with the mixed-phase MoS2. The obtained sample displayed much improved H2 evolution ability with nearly 92% decreased cost of the noble metal. The introduction of Au not only facilitates the high dispersion of MoS2 but also significantly induces the formation of 1T MoS2, thus providing low-cost cocatalyst and semiconductor at the same time in the photocatalyst. Moreover, interfacial Au induces the formation of the Z-scheme heterostructure between CNN and 2H MoS2, guaranteeing a relatively high reduction ability of the photogenerated electrons. This work provides a new pathway to manipulate the transfer and separation behaviors of charge carriers in heterostructure photocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) room temperature (RT) gas sensors are of great value for monitoring leaks of hazardous gases under harsh environments. However, the highly sensitive and rapid detection of TMDs in an energy-efficient state is still a formidable obstacle. This work reports the ultrasensitive NO2 sensor based on rare-earth Nd doped VS2/carbon nanofibers (CNFs) (abbreviated as x%Nd-VS2-C), which exhibits a fast response/recovery and intense response at RT. The impact of the Nd doping amount on the NO2-sensing properties of x%Nd-VS2-C was systematically explored. The active Nd-doping and abundant S vacancies could activate the inert basal planes of VS2 efficiently and increase the active sites of the surface, thereby improving the NO2-sensing performance of the sensor. Additionally, theoretical calculations validate the finding by demonstrating a more negative NO2 adsorption energy of −3.12 eV on the (001) surface of Nd-VS2-C compared to −1.26 eV on pure VS2. The 2% Nd-VS2-C exhibits optimal RT NO2-sensing properties, with a thrilling response/recovery rate (∼17 s/20 s), high sensitivity (∼3.03 to 10 ppm of NO2), favorable selectivity and stability, and low detection limit (18 ppb). The outstanding \"'4S'\" features make the 2%Nd-VS2-C sensor greatly attractive for precise and ultrasensitive NO2 detection at RT.",

However, the structure–photophysical property relationship remains ambiguous, because of the ready occurrence of structural defects in the fragile lattice. Here, using FASnI3 microcrystals synthesized with tailored reaction conditions, we unveil that structural defects can induce bandgap widening and abnormal photoluminescence. Based on combined analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and optical spectroscopy, we propose that bandgap widening could stem from defect-mediated lattice distortion. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements lead us to the discovery of a new near-infrared photoluminescence band between 185 and 10 K and negative thermal quenching in a broad range of 110–200 K. We believe that the knowledge gained here may not only offer a plausible roadmap to prepare high-quality organic–inorganic tin halide perovskite crystals but can also deepen our understanding on the relationship between defects and photophysical properties of tin-based perovskites.",

    "abstract": "It is still unclear how weak interactions specifically affect electronic structures. Here, we systematically reduce the number of N–H bonds within diarylmethane (DAM), precisely diminishing the number of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). Contrary to the widely reported result that H-bonds could enhance molecular brightness by promoting electron delocalization, DAMs lacking H-bonds exhibit superior luminescence, compared to DAMs with H-bonds in both dilute solutions and solid states. It is indicated that H-bonds tend to induce n-electron localization, preventing the formation of through-space lone-pair conjugation (n–n TSC). In addition, unlike the widely studied through-space π–π conjugation that only existed in the aggregate state, the n–n TSC can even stabilize the conformation and is expressed in dilute solutions. Herein, we not only achieve bright white-light emissions in nonconjugated small molecules but also reveal the surprisingly competitive relationship between H-bonds and n–n TSC in electronic delocalization, providing a new strategy for designing excellent optoelectronic materials via the n-electron bridge.",

This design aimed to enhance the boundary electron transfer capability, providing more interface active sites and thereby accelerating proton transfer and transport. As anticipated, the CoP/Co2Fe1P/CC catalyst exhibited exceptional performance in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. It required only a 73 mV overpotential for hydrogen evolution and 253 mV overpotential for oxygen evolution at a current density of 10 mA cm–2.

Moreover, the repeating length of key motifs inducing the formation of hydrogen bonds, of peptide sequences in determining the nucleation and growth rates, and controlling molecular-scale features has not yet been explored. Thus, we utilized the synthetic fibroin-like peptides with sequences of NH2–Y(GA)n=3–5Y–COOH to investigate the morphological and structural characteristics, molecular orientations, and single molecule structures on MoS2 under different time and concentration conditions.

Nevertheless, nickel-bis(dithiolene)-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have rarely been reported as photothermal and photocurrent agents. Herein, nickel-bis(dithiolene-dibenzoic acid) [Ni(C2S2(C6H4COOH)2)2], as a new functional redox-reversible \"non-innocent\" metalloligand, was innovatively assembled into two MOFs, [Zn2{Ni(C2S2(C6H4COO)2)2}(H2O)2]·2DMF and [Cd2{Ni(C2S2(C6H4COO)2)2}(H2O)2]·2DMF (1 and 2, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide). Under one-sun illumination (0.1 W cm–2, 300–2500 nm), the temperature of the MOFs sharply increased to 69.6 and 69.3 °C from room temperature in 300 s, concomitant with induced photocurrents of 7.0 and 6.5 μA for 1 and 2. The considerable performance is due to charge transfer, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and solid-state UV/vis–NIR spectroscopy. This study not only provides insights into the development of photothermal and photoconductivity materials but also paves the way for designing functional materials with appealing applications.",

The biomimetic design of bone scaffolds across four dimensions significantly extends the concept of bone tissue engineering. In this review, the evolution of the bone repair concept is first briefly summarized. Then, we analyze the characteristics of bone composition, structure, mechanics, and bone repair in the physiological state based on the biomimetic concept. Comprehensive strategies for biomimetic scaffold fabrication are discussed, and future development perspectives are offered, advocating the biomimetic concept as a guiding principle for future scaffold design and fabrication.",

Nanomotors possessing autonomous movement exhibit a high efficacy in antibiofilm therapy. Herein, a nanomotor (Cu-tbDMSNs@Arg) driven by NO and H2S gases is proposed. Cu-tbDMSNs@Arg nanomotors can rapidly penetrate biofilms by releasing NO and H2S simultaneously in biofilm microenvironments (BME) with high levels of H2O2 and GSH. In addition, the nanomotor containing Cu2+ can regulate the Fenton-like reaction to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which substantially enhances the antibacterial effect of the nanomotor, to result in a 2.47 log10 reduction in bacterial cell counts. Furthermore, in a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected pyomyositis mice model, Cu-tbDMSNs@Arg nanomotors can effectively target and accumulate at the site of infection to eliminate biofilm and have anti-inflammatory and angiogenic capabilities.

Detailed experimental and theoretical results show that the PUs have different temperature-dependent behaviors related to the interplay of H-bonding, through-space n−π interactions, and aggregation properties.

    "abstract": "This study explores the challenging heteroepitaxial growth of wurtzite AlN on monoclinic β-Ga2O3(-201) using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. By optimizing various nucleation and growth conditions, particularly the Al/N flux ratio, we achieve optimal surface morphology and structural quality. Substrate nitridation growth under N-rich conditions is found to favor the formation of smooth AlN with a sharp nitride/oxide heterointerface, whereas Al-rich conditions lead to the formation of rougher AlN textured along the <0001> direction but with highly twisted grains. Comprehensive structural analyses show the growth of a high-quality AlN(0001) layer with a homogeneous Al polarity on β-Ga2O3(-201), exhibiting an epitaxial relationship of AlN[2-1-10] // β-Ga2O3[020]. The present findings, supported by theoretical calculations reporting the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas with a charge interface density higher than 1013 cm–2, open important perspectives for the development of next generation power electronic devices made of ultrawide band gap semiconductors.",

A key challenge lies in developing photocatalyst materials capable of efficiently splitting water vapor under practical conditions. In this study, we present a photocatalytic system based on gold nanoparticles immobilized on a glass-based porous scaffold through reactive metal support interactions. This structure exhibits a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 2.2% under simulated solar light. Long-term cycling tests demonstrate stable H2 evolution, with observed declines in efficiency caused by surface hydroxyl and carboxyl group formation, although it is effectively restored through plasma treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of robust and efficient photocatalytic materials, advancing the potential path for scalable commercial applications.",

Herein we present a high-performance polymer for near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging-guided mild photothermal therapy (mPTT) of tumors. We synthesize a series of semiconducting polymers based on pyrrolopyrrole cyanine, identifying that P(P-T) exhibits large mass extinction coefficient (139 L g–1 cm–1), excellent photothermal performance, bright NIR-II fluorescence, and PA imaging signals, making it among the highest-performing polymers in these properties. A tumor-targeting agent was developed by coencapsulating the high-performance polymer with a heat shock protein (HSP) inhibitor and camouflaging with M1 macrophage membranes. The integration of NIR-II fluorescence and PA imaging enables comprehensive tumor site delineation, guiding subsequent therapeutic intervention. In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, the synergistic effect of mPTT under low-power 808 nm laser irradiation, combined with HSP inhibition, resulted in significant tumor suppression. This work offers valuable insights for designing advanced phototheranostic agents.",

We use spectroelectrochemical measurements on P(NDI2OD-T2), spectroscopic studies of a chemically reduced model compound, 2,2′-(2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl)-bis(N,N′-di-n-hexylnaphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide)) (NDI-T2-NDI), and electronic structure calculations to evaluate the microscopic charge-transport parameters. Experimental and computational data suggest that NDI-T2-NDI•– is a class-II mixed-valence compound, strongly supporting the small-polaron hopping model as a charge-transport mechanism for electrons along polymer chains in P(NDI2OD-T2). The electronic coupling between the NDI redox units is at least 21 meV, while the reorganization energy is between 0.45 and 0.56 eV. Using a hopping model, we estimated the mobility and activation energy for electron transport along P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer chains to be 0.15 cm2 V–1 s–1 and 60 meV, respectively. Our study elucidates a long-standing issue of explaining the coexistence in P(NDI2OD-T2) of localized redox sites with relatively large electron mobilities more usually achieved only in highly conjugated polymers.",

    "abstract": "The efficient harvesting of hot carriers (HCs) from high-energy photons can significantly enhance the optoelectronic performances. However, ultrafast HC cooling through intraband transitions poses a significant challenge for extraction using traditional semiconductor absorbers. The stable and compressible vacancy-ordered halide perovskites with isolated octahedra exhibit discrete electronic states at the conduction band edge, indicating the possible slow cooling of hot electrons (HEs). Using state-of-the-art ab initio quantum dynamics simulations and unsupervised machine learning (ML), we investigate the effect of lattice stress on HE dynamics in vacancy-ordered Cs2SnBr6. The moderate stress enhances structural rigidity and weakens dynamic electron–phonon interactions at the conduction bands. Such modifications and the widened energy gap at the conduction band edge partially suppress intraband nonadiabatic transitions, eventually elongating the HE lifetime. The pairwise mutual information extracts hard-to-find highly nonlinear dynamic structure-excited state property correlations, offering the unique opportunity to design efficient lead-free halide perovskites for HE-based optoelectronics strategically.",

    "abstract": "We report the synthesis of bell-shaped Bi/Bi13S18Br2 metal/semiconductor heterostructures as a photocatalyst based on nontoxic and Earth-abundant elements. Their unique morphology arises from a multistep growth process, involving (1) the nucleation of Bi13S18Br2 nanorods, (2) the reduction of a metallic-Bi domain on their surface induced by N,N-didodecylmethylamine, and (3) the heterostructure accretion by a localized reaction at the Bi/Bi13S18Br2 interface promoted by Ostwald ripening. These heterostructures display remarkable stability in polar solvents, remaining almost unaffected by prolonged exposure to isopropanol and water, and exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic dyes (i.e., Rhodamine B and Methylene Blue) under visible-light irradiation, with good recyclability. Additionally, preliminary tests demonstrate CO2 reduction capabilities, which make these heterostructures promising for both the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and photoelectrochemical CO2 conversion. The straightforward synthesis process and the use of nontoxic and Earth-abundant elements offer significant potential for sustainable energy conversion technologies.",

    "abstract": "Descriptors play an important role in data-driven materials design. While most descriptors of crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. Here, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress electron densities into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance materials design.",

    "abstract": "Heat transport in glasses over a wide temperature range is critical for applications in gate dielectrics and thermal insulators but remains poorly understood due to the challenges in modeling vibrational anharmonicity and configurational dynamics across the glass transition. Recent predictions show an unusual decrease in thermal conductivity (κ) with temperature in amorphous hafnia (a-HfO2), contrasting with the typical trend in glasses. Using molecular dynamics with a machine-learning-based neuroevolution potential, we compute κ of a-HfO2 from 50 K to 2000 K. At low temperatures, the Wigner transport equation captures both anharmonicity and quantum statistics. Above 1200 K, atomic diffusion invalidates the quasiparticle picture, and we resort to the Green-Kubo method to capture convective transport. We further extend the Wigner transport equation to supercooled a-HfO2, revealing the crucial role of low-frequency modes in facilitating heat transport. The computed κ, based on both Green-Kubo and Wigner transport theories, increases continuously with temperature up to 2000 K.",

We present a computational study on such inverted singlet-triplet (IST) molecules modified for chirality to enable Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL), an unexplored direction for IST emitters. Two main chromophores, triangulene and pentalene, were functionalized with minimal chiral groups, preserving negative ΔE ST , as demonstrated via multiconfigurational calculations. We also explored inherently chiral, nonplanar chromophores, focusing on extended triangulenes resembling helicenes. Substituents enabling enantiomer separation were introduced, and racemization barriers were assessed. When singlet-triplet inversion was lost, structures were further optimized, yielding a promising substrate combining a high racemization barrier, strong CPL, and inverted singlet-triplet energetics, making it suitable for CP-OLED applications.",

Direct exposure to UV filters has given rise to health problems, including the percutaneous penetration and the generation of reactive oxygen species. To address these, we have developed organic UV-filter self-framed microparticles, whereby organic UV-filter molecules self-construct into nanoparticles without any supportive microencapsulation. This approach is unique for its outstanding biocompatibility by reducing the percutaneous penetration of organic UV-filter molecules. Furthermore, the shielding range is extended from the UVB to the entire UV region by the introduction of a physical reflection effect. An in vitro fibroblast culture experiment and the results of in vivo skin protection experiments confirmed their safety. All the experimental results supported the conclusion that sunblock with self-framed microparticles (FSFMPs) has a great potential to become the next generation of UV filters for the UV protection of skin.",

SAPO-34 membranes displayed helium permeance as high as 2.28 × 10–7 mol/(m2 s Pa) and separation selectivity as high as 13.8 for He/CH4 mixtures. The separation of this binary mixture was favored through molecular sieving and diffusivity differences.

In this study, a bioorthogonal system based on tetrazine-mediated inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction was fabricated to achieve fluorescence imaging and prodrug activation simultaneously. A vinyl ether-caged CPT was synthesized and utilized as the anti-tumor prodrug, and a tetrazine derivative linked with a near-infrared dye was prepared and used as the trigger, as well as the fluorescence probe. The bioorthogonal reaction between the two components in aqueous media generated strong fluorescence and released the active drug. The molecular prodrug and trigger were then encapsulated in phospholipid liposomes to afford a nanosized liposomal bioorthogonal system. The resultant liposomal system could accumulate in tumor region upon administration into the tumor-bearing mice and undergo bioorthogonal reaction, thereby releasing CPT for tumor inhibition and producing strong fluorescence for imaging. The bioorthogonal system was found to exhibit high efficacy in tumor inhibition. This study suggests that the bioorthogonal bond-cleavage reactions may serve as promising external stimuli to activate probes and release active drugs in vivo.",

We demonstrate the tuning of bandgap and the emission color of the desired domain in a lead halide perovskite microrod, which is realized by increasing the local concentration of the halide precursor under optical trapping using a nonresonant near-infrared laser beam. Similarly, the bandgap and the emission color of a crystal among several crystals are temporally tuned by a locally induced halide exchange reaction. Using this method, we overcome spontaneous halide exchange at undesired locations or crystals. We minimize photothermal and photochemical effects on halide exchange and photoinduced damage to the crystals by optical trapping using a 1064 nm continuous wave laser beam. The site-specific halide exchange offers flexible spatial control of bandgap and photoluminescence for designing perovskite-based heterojunction structures by laser scanning.",

Our results indicate that the photocatalytic rate of unconventional 4H Au is nearly 6–8 times that of conventional face-centered cubic (fcc) Au, suggesting the greater activity of hot electrons on 4H Au. Further electrochemical reductions of pNTP on the 4H and fcc Au nanostructures in aqueous solutions also confirm the higher catalytic activity of the 4H Au. Our study demonstrates that the synthesis of Au nanomaterials with controlled crystal phases paves the way for developing highly efficient catalyst.",

Cholesteryl ester liquid crystals (CLCs) are particularly well suited for these applications, due to their roles in cellular homeostasis and their intrinsic ability to organize into supramolecular helicoidal structures on the mesoscale. Here, we developed a nonwoven CLC electrospun scaffold by dispersing three cholesteryl ester-based mesogens within polycaprolactone (PCL). We tuned the ratio of our mesogens so that the CLC would be in the mesophase at the cell culture incubator temperature of 37 °C. In these scaffolds, the PCL polymer provided an elastic bulk matrix while the homogeneously dispersed CLC established a viscoelastic fluidlike interface. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the 50% (w/v) cholesteryl ester liquid crystal scaffold (CLC-S) exhibited a mesophase with topographic striations typical of liquid crystals. Additionally, the CLC-S favorable wettability and ultrasoft fiber mechanics enhanced cellular attachment and proliferation. Increasing the CLC concentration within the composites enhanced myoblast adhesion strength promoted myofibril formation in vitro with mouse myoblast cell lines.",

Here, we demonstrate a facile self-combustion synthesis route to novel ternary molybdenum nitrides. The room temperature mixing of NaNH2, MoCl4, and 3d transition metal chlorides, such as MnCl2, FeCl2, and CoCl2, initiates a highly exothermic metathesis reaction, which is thermodynamically driven by the formation of stable NaCl, N2, and NH3 byproducts. The rapid combustion reaction yields ternary rocksalt γ-TMxMo1–xN0.5 nanoparticles (TM = Mn, Fe, Co) in just a few seconds. We calculate from DFT that these disordered ternary molybdenum nitrides are thermodynamically stable under the high-temperatures at which they form but are remnantly metastable when quenched to ambient conditions. Introduction of Mn, Fe, and Co into γ-Mo2N is found to change its magnetic properties and to enhance its oxygen reduction catalytic activities. Our work demonstrates self-combustion synthesis as a simple but powerful route for the realization of novel ternary intermetallic nitrides with emergent functionality.",

Thus, it is desirable to investigate other BP-like 2D materials, which may have improved stability, while preserving the exceptional electronic properties of BP. Herein, using an efficient structure search method, we predicted a novel 2D BP-like material, namely, a honeycomb NP sheet (α-NP). Remarkably, its few-layer α-NP sheets possess not only a tunable direct bandgap under in-plane strain but also high mobility (×104 cm2 V–1 s–1) and absorption coefficients (×105 cm–1). These advantageous characteristics endow the α-NP sheets as a very potential 2D material for efficient photovoltaic cell applications, as demonstrate by an estimated photovoltaic efficiency of ∼14%, when its thickness is at ∼1 μm. When combined with 2D MoTe2, it can provide a type-II heterojunction solar cell with a conversion efficiency up to ∼16%. We also proposed a feasible strategy for mechanical cleavage to prepare the α-NP sheets from its bulk NP compound. Once prepared, the α-NP sheets may offer superior photovoltaic properties and facilitate the development of solar cells and optoelectronic devices.",

Here, we report the surface engineering of Na2Ti3O7 nanotube arrays grown in situ on Ti foil through a hydrothermal method and subsequent NH3-assisted calcination. Benefiting from the effective surface modification, the as-derived free-standing electrode possesses highly crystalline surface with favorable Na+ diffusion kinetics and self-incorporation of abundant Ti3+ for improved electronic conductivity. These features enable the electrode to achieve remarkable reversible capacity (237.9 mAh g–1), ultra-high rate capability (88.5 mAh g–1 at 100 C = 17.7 A g–1), and excellent cycling stability (92.32% capacity retention at 50 C after 5000 cycles), which are superior to the counterpart without surface modification, as well as almost all Na2Ti3O7-based anode materials reported so far for SIBs. The outstanding electrochemical performance demonstrates the feasibility of proposed surface modulation in designing more efficient electrode materials for energy storage.",

    "abstract": "Organic heterostructured micro-/nanomaterials (OHTMs) integrating heterostructured advantages and organic material character have drawn strong attention in nanoscience and nanotechnology to meet the ever-increasing technological requirements. However, the fine synthesis of OHTMs with high spatial/angular characteristics remains challenging because of the complex epitaxial relationships of material combinations. Herein, we develop a rational sequential self-assembly strategy to synthesize the OHTMs composed of m-BCB or o-BCB one-dimensional (1D) microrods or microbelts as trunks and TPBe 2D microplates as branches via regulating the π–π interaction intensity (|Eo-BCB = −25.56 kcal mol–1| > |Em-BCB = −15.49 kcal mol–1| > |ETPBe = −5.06 kcal mol–1|). Notably, both the lattice matching and the surface–interface energy balance prefer heterogeneous nucleation and epitaxial growth of the branch part on the surfaces of the preformed seed trunk part. Our sequential self-assembly approach demonstrates a universal avenue to precisely synthesize the OHTMs in a desired mode, which provides promising candidate for the integrated optoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Pyrite FeS2 has long been considered a potentially ideal photovoltaic material, but solar cells utilizing pyrite exhibit low open-circuit voltages (VOC) and have failed to achieve conversion efficiencies >3%. The recent discovery of a conductive p-type surface layer on n-type pyrite single crystals raises the intriguing possibility that the low VOC results from a leaky internal p–n junction between the surface and interior. Here, we reveal this internal junction, for the first time, through horizontal electronic transport measurements on sulfur vacancy (VS)- and Co-doped n-type pyrite single crystals. We observe a steep increase in resistance upon cooling heavily VS-doped crystals below ∼200 K, as the dominant charge transport crosses over from interior to surface conduction. The frequently employed two-resistor equivalent circuit model for lightly-doped pyrite crystals cannot reproduce this steep rise, but it can be accounted for, quantitatively, and with high fidelity, by adding an internal Schottky junction resistance between the surface and the interior. The average extracted Schottky barrier height is 320 meV (varying from 130–560 meV), significantly below expectations from band bending calculations (>750 meV) but similar in magnitude to VOC values reported for pyrite heterojunction solar cells. This internal p–n junction is thus implicated as the potential origin of the long-standing low-VOC problem in pyrite.",

    "abstract": "Applying elastic deformation can tune a material's physical properties locally and reversibly. Spatially modulated lattice deformation can create a bandgap gradient, favoring photogenerated charge separation and collection in optoelectronic devices. These advantages are hindered by the maximum elastic strain that a material can withstand before breaking. Nanomaterials derived by exfoliating transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are an ideal playground for elastic deformation, as they can sustain large elastic strains, up to a few percent. However, exfoliable TMDs with highly strain-tunable properties have proven challenging for researchers to identify. We investigated 1T-ZrS2 and 1T-ZrSe2, exfoliable semiconductors with large bandgaps. Under compressive deformation, both TMDs dramatically change their physical properties. 1T-ZrSe2 undergoes a reversible transformation into an exotic three-dimensional lattice, with a semiconductor-to-metal transition. In ZrS2, the irreversible transformation between two different layered structures is accompanied by a sudden 14% bandgap reduction. These results establish that Zr-based TMDs are an optimal strain-tunable platform for spatially textured bandgaps, with a strong potential for novel optoelectronic devices and light harvesting.",

    "abstract": "Efficient photovoltaic cells based on thin films of solution-processed 2D Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskites (RPPs) represent an exciting breakthrough due to their enhanced tunability and chemical stability relative to those fabricated from 3D phases. However, reports of efficient charge separation and current collection are in apparent contradiction with the well-known enhancement of the exciton binding energy in multilayered halide perovskites, which should lower the device's internal quantum efficiency and voltage. This controversy has led to various proposals for the electronic and physical structure of RPP thin films, including phase inhomogeneity as the driving force for exciton dissociation and transport. We address this apparent paradox in high-quality hot-cast RPP films by correlating ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy with X-ray scattering measurements. We show that a hot-casting fabrication method produces highly phase pure n = 3 (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 RPP structures. The high-phase purity and large grain sizes allow us to observe vertical transport of excitons via a diffusive process and allow us to determine that charge separation is primarily driven by dissociation at surface localized subgap electronic states. We analyze the differential absorption kinetics in films of varying thickness to directly determine that the excitonic diffusion constant is ∼0.18 cm2 s–1. We propose that a surface localized structural distortion, observed using surface selective grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements, is responsible for the creation of the surface localized defect states. We find that the density and spatial distribution of these defect states is a function of preparation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid materials of metal chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (QDs) embedded in metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have led to composites with synergistic properties. Here, we investigate how QD size, surface chemistry, and MHP film formation methods affect the resulting optoelectronic properties of QD/MHP \"dot-in-matrix\" systems. We monitor the QD absorption and photoluminescence throughout synthesis, ligand exchange, and transfer into the MHP ink, and we characterize the final QD/MHP films via electron microscopy and transient absorption. In addition, we are the first to globally map how PbS QDs are distributed on the micrometer scale within these dot-in-matrix systems, using three-dimensional (3D) tomography time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The surface chemistry imparted during synthesis directly affects the optical properties of the dot-in-matrix composites. Pb-halide passivation leads to QD/MHP dot-in-matrix samples with optical properties that are well-described by a theoretical model, based on a Type I finite-barrier heterostructure between the PbS QD and the MHP matrix. Samples without Pb-halide passivation show complicated size-dependent behavior, indicating a transition from a Type I heterostructure between the PbS QD wells and MHP barriers for small-sized QDs to PbS QDs that are electronically decoupled from the MHP matrix for larger QDs. Furthermore, the choice in perovskite antisolvent crystallization method leads to a difference in the spatial QD distribution within the perovskite matrix, differences in carrier lifetime, and photoluminescence shifts of up to 180 meV for PbS in methylammonium lead iodide. This work establishes an understanding of such emerging synergistic systems relevant for technologies such as photovoltaics, infrared emitters and detectors, and other unexplored technological applications.",

    "abstract": "Wet chemical etching has been one crucial method in the design strategy of functional materials, from microfabrication to nanoparticle synthesis. It has been suggested that shapes of building blocks could change the structures that particles assemble into. While much effort has been devoted to ZIF-8 colloids to create particles with different shapes, such as convex polyhedral particles, cubic particles, and hollowing microboxes, micro or nanoporous ZIF-8 colloids with high quality and high yield remain largely underexplored because of limited fundamental understanding of the etching mechanism. Here we achieved the preparation of porous metal–organic framework (MOF) particles in colloids by wet chemical etching of as-synthesized parent particles. To understand the etching mechanisms, the pH value of the etching solution was modified as a controllable parameter. Different types of porous ZIF-8 particles were observed as the etching solution pH was varied. Quantitatively, the 3D electron tomography technique was applied to analyze porous ZIF-8 particles giving many structure properties such as the surface area, pore size and distribution, and skeletonization. This 3D quantification reveals the advantage of the porous structure, which will benefit its potential application after atomic doping treatment. The porous ZIF-8 colloids can also self-assemble into different superstructures facilitated by its novel morphology, and a linear polymerization was observed in one type of porous ZIF-8 colloid. The assembled superstructure depends on particles' orientation in solution, and the self-assembly kinetics was captured by in situ microscopy. We anticipate that the wet chemical etching method and 3D tomography technique reported here opens a new door to understand and engineer functional porous materials.",

    "abstract": "Zeolite crystallization often requires the presence of an organic structure-directing agent (SDA) to facilitate the formation of nanoporous cages and channels. Among the limited number of zeolites that can be synthesized in organic-free media, alkali metals are most commonly employed as inorganic SDAs. Many alkali metal zeolites are usually prepared under moderate conditions using temperatures less than 100 °C and synthesis times on the order of hours. One notable exception is zeolite chabazite (CHA), which is prepared from potassium ions and requires atypically long crystallization times on the order of weeks. Attaining practical synthesis times on the order of days necessitates an alternative approach, such as the use of zeolite crystal seeds. In this study, we show that growth solutions prepared via the partial substitution of potassium with strontium generate purely-crystalline chabazite within hours without the need for either organics or crystal seeds. Studies of strontium inclusion in seed-assisted syntheses also reveal shorter synthesis times. Notably, we show that strontium has a pronounced impact on the kinetics of chabazite formation, leading to 14- and 3-fold reductions in crystallization time compared with pure potassium syntheses in the absence and presence of crystal seeds, respectively. Using a combination of 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, we also show that strontium functions as a SDA based on its ability to alter Q4(nAl)29Si speciation, thereby redistributing tetrahedral Al sites in the framework. Given the widespread application of chabazite in adsorption and separation processes, designing facile and efficient synthesis approaches with concomitant control of physicochemical properties is commercially relevant.",

Breaking the symmetrical atomic arrangements is theoretically feasible to solve this issue, but technically challenging. Herein, surface-disordered Pt–Ni nanowires (d-Pt–Ni NWs) are synthesized via a lithiation/delithiation method. The d-Pt–Ni NWs exhibit an ultralow overpotential of 15 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for HER catalysis, substantially superior to the crystalline counterpart and commercial Pt/C. Fine structural analyses reveal that the structural disorder can well regulate the electronic structures of Pt–Ni and the generated oxygenated nickel species contribute to stabilize the disordered structures. Furthermore, theoretical studies unravel that the oxygenated nickel with lower unoccupied orbitals helps facilitate water dissociation, while the upshift of the d band center of Pt enables superior H adsorption. More importantly, surface disordering is finally demonstrated to be a universal strategy to boost the HER activities of Pt-based alloys. Manipulating the surface atomic arrangement offers a new opportunity to design and optimize Pt-based catalysts and beyond.",

Tin-based perovskite materials have been selected as the ideal alternative to lead-based perovskite due to their similar optoelectronic properties. However, the performance of tin perovskite solar cells is still much lower than their lead perovskite counterparts. Various strategies have been introduced in order to enhance the efficiency of tin perovskite solar cells. In this research, A-site cation substitution has been performed using dimethylammonium cation (DMA+) in the form of dimethylammonium iodide (DMAI) salt. An optimized concentration of DMAI enhanced the performance of tin perovskite solar cells to a more than 10% boosted higher open-circuit voltage (VOC). A better surface morphology was obtained with DMA+ substitution. From Mott–Schottky measurements, a higher built-in potential has been obtained, which helped with charge carrier extraction. Furthermore, from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, tin oxidation has been suppressed, leading to low hole carrier density. This work provides evidence that controlling the charge carrier density in tin-based perovskite solar cells is important to fabricating high performance devices.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) have attracted great attention because of their capacity for reprocessing and remolding, based on macromolecular architecture transformations or rearrangements through dynamic exchange reactions. Here, a new dynamic exchange reaction between a phenol and an enol-one motif yielded from the phenol-yne click reaction is introduced, and the phenol-yne click reaction is facilely integrated into the fabrication of a novel DCN. To expand the scope of material recycling, another degradable DCN prepared using the same click reaction but with a degradable diacetal motif is introduced. After thermal fusion of these two DCNs and subsequent acidic hydrolysis, a porous polymer film with a porosity of 46% is afforded, which is verified to possess excellent oil absorption capacity and recyclability. The strategic design and fabrication of porous polymer films provide an entirely new pathway for the application of DCNs.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we designed a Cd/macrocycle-based metal–organic framework (MOF), namely, [Cd5O(L)(H2O)4]4DMF·5H2O (Cd-L) (L8– = calix[4]resorcinarene-based carboxylate ion and DMF = N,N-dimethylforamide). The pentanuclear Cd–O clusters are linked by L8– anions to form a polymeric structure. Eight coordinated Cd(II) ions in Cd-L can be replaced by Cu(II) ions through a postsynthetic metal exchange method in an aqueous solution at room temperature to afford a CdCu bimetallic MOF [Cd4OCu(L)(H2O)4]DMF·7H2O (CdCu-L). Electrochemical analysis shows that the conductivity of CdCu-L increases by about 3 times after the introduction of copper ions into Cd-L. On account of the unique structure, CdCu-L is used for electrocatalytic detection of uric acid (UA) in real samples. For UA with various concentrations from 10 to 500 μM, the oxidation peak current of the CdCu-L-based electrode increases linearly, and the detection limit of UA is calculated to be 2.67 μM. The CdCu-L-based electrode exhibits high selectivity, reproducibility, and stability during the UA detection. This research presents a mixed Cd/Cu-based MOF for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of UA.",

The structure of an active material which resists complete delithiation is studied to move toward unlocking the full storage capacity of ion-conductive spinels. High-precision diffraction also reveals nonlinear coupling between strain and lithiation state inside the cathode at high voltages, which suggests the phase diagram of this material is more complex than previously assumed. X-ray diffraction depth-profiling shows that large lithiation heterogeneities through the cross-section of the electrode are formed even at low currents and that decoupling these gradients are necessary to study the phase transitions in detail.",

Then, the interfacial interaction requires a strong directional anisotropy, as provided by π–π stacking. However, a detailed understanding of the direction-dependent strength of π–π stacking is lacking because such direction-dependent molecular force measurements are challenging. We use atomic force microscopy-based stereographic single molecule force spectroscopy to perform direction-dependent pulling of a π–π stacking model system in solution, namely, a single pyrene molecule on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. There, the friction force is at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than the adhesive force, indicating superlubricity at the single molecule level. This is in clear contrast to the thiol–Au coordination bond, where we reveal high friction forces. Our measurements quantify and highlight the importance of the directional anisotropy of π–π stacking, which provides a bottom-up understanding of adhesion and friction at material interfaces based on its molecular interactions.",

In the standard crystallization methods, the additives play an important role not only in optimizing the crystallization but also passivating the defect states of perovskite films. Methylammonium chloride (MACl) is one of the frequently used additives in this regard. However, the performance mechanism of MACl in the perovskite crystallization process still needs more investigation. This work presents the quality improvement of a perovskite film using MACl vapor as an external chlorine source. The in situ 2D-GIXRD and real-time X-ray diffraction characterizations provide a better understanding the performance mechanism of MACl. Our results demonstrate that exposing the perovskite film to the MACl vapor during the crystallization process can effectively enhance the film quality in addition to enlarging the grain sizes.

However, the difficulty of constructing free-standing MOF membranes has hindered their applications. Here, we propose a facile strategy to fabricate free-standing MOF sheets with easy-peeling and easy-transfer properties through electrochemical printing on superhydrophobic micropillar-structured substrates. During the electrochemical printing process, electrophoretic deposition will occur along the solid/liquid/gas triphase interface on these substrates. First, the effects of the electrophoretic deposition conditions, such as deposition time and current, on the thickness-controlled growth on superhydrophobic substrates are explored. Then, the influences of the geometric parameters, such as diameter and distance, and wettability of the micropillars on constructing free-standing MOF sheets are systematically studied. Furthermore, the MOF sheets exhibit the properties of capillarity-assisted peeling from superhydrophobic substrates and spreading-assisted transfer to superhydrophilic substrates, followed by the demonstration of the generality. Therefore, it is a facile method to prepare free-standing MOF sheets with easy-peeling and easy-transfer properties taking advantage of electrochemical printing on superhydrophobic substrates, giving impetus to the improvement of the productivity and the corresponding applications in various fields.",

In this work, we study the phase transition and electrochemical performance of 2H-MoS2 in ether- and ester-based electrolytes. Interestingly, we find that the MoS2 anode develops MoS2/diglyme-Na+ superlattices induced by cointercalation of Na+ and an ether solvent in an ether-based electrolyte, rather than the conversion reaction observed in ester-based electrolytes. The superlattices consist of mixed semiconductive 2H and metallic 1T phases, and are structurally stable and kinetically favorable for the repeated sodiation, which greatly enhances the capacity, cycling, and rate performance of MoS2. Specifically, the three-dimensional MoS2 nanoflowers deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 446.5 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1 with no capacity fading after more than 3700 cycles in an ether-based electrolyte.",

    "abstract": "Reductive electrodeposition is a technique for the preparation of substrate-supported MOF films but is generally incompatible with poorly or nonconductive substrates like polymers and suffers from the possible codeposition of metallic impurities. Here, we report a facile and inexpensive strategy that achieves one-step reductive electrodeposition of impurity-free MOF films (i.e., HKUST-1 film) on nonconducting poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes. Unlike previously reported reductive electrodeposition configurations, which only contain the electrode–electrolyte interface near the working electrode, there are two tandem interfaces in the proposed approach, namely, the electrode–membrane interface and the membrane–electrolyte interface. Owing to the counter-diffusion of ions across the polymer membrane, this strategy allows the generation of MOF units on the membrane–electrolyte interface, while the codeposition of metal happens on the other, resulting in the deposition of a pure MOF film on untreated polymer membranes. Importantly, thanks to the inherent \"self-closing\" ability of the proposed electrochemical approach, a compact polycrystalline HKUST-1 film supported on PES membrane was obtained under mild conditions, which exhibited a rejection of 98.7% for rose bengal in an aqueous solution with a permeance of 7.4 L m–2 h–1 bar–1.",

However, optimized materials that can more efficiently collect and utilize solar energy are demanded. Here, inspired by the thermal insulation ability of polar bear hairs, we fabricated a villous carbon frameworks (VCF) embedded with FeNi3 alloys. Under illumination, the achieved local temperature surpassed the bare carbon frameworks (CF). This highly promoted the OER performance of the inner electrocatalysts. With light illumination intensity of 0.25 W cm–2, the VCF demonstrated an overpotential of 194 mV to deliver 100 mA cm–2 current density. The current density at 1.45 V could reach over 300 mA cm–2, about 8.5-fold of that without illumination, outperforming traditional photothermal electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, quasi-operando soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS) manifested that the photothermal effect of the VCF would boost the electron rearrangement of iron–nickel species during OER and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Our design principle was transferable to other catalysts whose performance could be accelerated by the photothermal effect.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the potential-induced changes across the electrode/electrolyte interface, the so-called electric double layer (EDL), is essential to adjust the working properties of energy-storage devices. Electrolytes with a high molar ratio of metal salt to solvent (1:1 salt:solvent), e.g., superconcentrated ionic liquids (ILs), enable uniform metal deposition, formation of stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), and higher redox stability, which make them attractive for battery applications. However, the presence of an organic IL cation and its interactions with metal salt complexes can significantly impact the mechanism of charge transfer at an electrode compared with conventional ether/ester-based electrolytes. The competition between IL and metal cations to enter the electrified interface affects interfacial chemistry, a key determinant of metal deposition potential and the nature of the SEI. This, in turn, is also affected by IL cation and anion chemistries, which are not yet fully understood. This letter demonstrates that the polarity of an organic IL cation, which is expressed through its dipole moment (μ), and its redox stability can serve as a predictive descriptor for EDL structure in superconcentrated IL electrolytes and the implications for charge transfer. We showed that, in the family of pyrrolidinium cations, a less polar organic cation with a small μ, e.g. N-methyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium [C2mpyr]+, packs tighter and in a greater number at a negatively charged electrode/electrolyte interface in comparison to more polar IL cations with greater μ, e.g. N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium [C3mpyr]+ and N-methyl-N-methoxymethylpyrrolidinium [C2O1mpyr]+. This IL cation-rich interface results in a greater overpotential for Na deposition, whereas the nature of the SEI and sodium anode cycling behavior correlate with both the dipole moment and the reductive stability of the IL cation.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for fast-charging batteries to expedite the widespread adoption of electric vehicles calls for continual improvements of the anode materials to confer high energy and power densities. However, the fundamental limitations of the mainstream graphite and Li-metal anodes for fast-charging applications include the capacity fading and safety issues mainly caused by the Li plating, as well as the sluggish transport kinetics at large current densities. Recently, great attention has been paid to the emergence of large-capacity anodes by tailoring the bonding covalency to modulate the electronic structure and alter the insertion voltage for boosting fast-charging ability and suppressing metal plating. Development of new fast-charging materials by tailoring anionic activity allows us to better understand the key aspects of the bond covalency and band positioning for cation/anion doping and interface/surface engineering. This Review provides an overview of the recent advances in the development of fast-charging anodes around tuning the bonding covalency by bimetal modulation; alloying hard and soft anions to alter the electronic structure and metal plating voltage; constructing anion-derived interfacial films; and surface substituting the ordered terminal groups. Furthermore, we highlight the practical limits of capacity fading at large current densities and describe potential strategies of anionic redox in phosphides and interfacial energy storage of conversion-type anodes to offer additional capacities. We also discuss the prospects for the commercial adoption of high-performance anodes containing various elements to rival the prevalent graphite or Li anodes for fast-charging applications.",

Therefore, it is necessary to directly compare unprocessed MOF powders and MOF-polymer composites as catalysts.

The NO release system is especially appropriate as CuBTTri has found real-world application in the field of biomedical materials. The results show, in this system, that the rate of NO generation changes when a CuBTTri polymer composite is the catalyst as opposed to the unprocessed MOF powder. Hence, findings for MOF powder catalysts may not always translate to MOF-polymer composites.",

Here, hygroscopic calcium-modified MXene/silk nanocomposite fibers (Ca@MSNFs) are fabricated by decorating the wet-spun MXene/silk fibers with hygroscopic CaCl2, exhibiting 3.2 g g–1 water capture capacity at 90% relative humidity (RH), high stretchability (279.9%), degradability, repairability, and freeze-resistance (−18 °C). Furthermore, the Ca@MSNFs are assembled as humidity/strain sensors to monitor respiratory signals and body movements, showing great promise for the diagnosis of apnea syndrome and rehabilitation training. Moreover, Ca@MSNFs are degradable and do not cause pollution or environmental damage. Therefore, this work offers a promising strategy for constructing stretchable and degradable electronic devices for advanced healthcare applications.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) metals have received considerable attention in recent years because of their fascinating physical and chemical properties, as well as potential applications in electrocatalysis, sensors, plasmonics, etc. However, the fabrication of 2D metals, especially atomically thin ones with large lateral size, remains a significant challenge because of the strong and isotropic metallic bonds. Here, we use Pt as a model system and demonstrate a general way to fabricate freestanding, high-quality 2D metals with giant aspect ratios (as large as ∼107) and controllable thickness down to 1 nm via a combination of room-temperature physical deposition and chemical etching. The cool deposition could suppress the Volmer–Webber growth mode, resulting in the formation of continuous ultrathin Pt with smooth surface and high conductivity. Moreover, the ultrathin 2D Pt exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a mass activity of 8.06 mA μg–1 at 0.06 V, ∼18 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the freestanding Pt-based strain sensor exhibits a high gauge factor of up to ∼4643, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional constantan wire-based strain gauges. Our studies pave the way for further developing wafer-scale 2D metal-based devices for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Catalytic therapy based on elaborate nanomedicine is emerging as a pioneering modality for tumor-specific treatment. However, its therapeutic efficiency is usually compromised by the self-protective mechanism of cancer cells, such as autophagy. Herein, a homologous targeting cascade nanobioreactor (denoted as CQ/CuZ@M4T1-G) was developed for the autophagy inhibition amplified enzymic-Fenton like catalytic therapy. CQ/CuZ@M4T1-G was constructed by wearing Cu2+-doped and chloroquine (CQ) loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework with glucose oxidase (GOx) anchored tumor cell membrane. The GOx-driven glycolysis effectively cut off glucose supply for starvation therapy, which also provided abundant H2O2 and decreased pH. Meanwhile, the released Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+ by glutathione and converted the elevated H2O2 into highly toxic ·OH via a Cu+-mediated Fenton-like reaction in the tumor. More importantly, autophagy inhibitor CQ was applied to block downstream autophagic flux and hinder the self-protection pathway. Thus, the tumor succumbed to the severe stress of an enzymatic-Fenton like cascading reaction, yielding a remarkable therapeutic effect as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo results. Our study provides a promising regimen mediated by the cascade nanobioreactor for a new type of oncotherapy in the future.",

In order to liberate terminal groups for more efficient intermolecular stackings, a new pathway to construct PSMAs is explored by extending molecular conjugation in branched directions, thereby affording two PSMAs of SP-T and SP-TT with thiophene and bithiophene as linkers, respectively. Benefiting from more compact/ordered π–π stackings and superior morphology, the SP-T-based all-PSC exhibits facilitated charge generation/transport and suppressed recombination, thus yielding a greatly improved efficiency of 13.54% compared with 9.76% for the SP-TT-based one.

Herein, 2-thiophenemethylammonium (TMA), known for the formation of Ruddlesden–Popper layered perovskites, is used to modify the PbI2 film. The introduction of TMA reduces the crystallinity of PbI2 and participates in the formation of the solvent intermediate phase, thus promoting the formation of α-formamidinium lead triiodide (α-FAPbI3) perovskite films in the whole film thickness direction. Most of TMA escapes from the film by deprotonation, and only trace amounts of TMA (0.02%) and the condensation product (TMFA, 0.10%) between TMA and formamidinium (FA) are found to be strongly bonded to the perovskite grain boundaries. The results show that the stability of the perovskite solar cell is improved and the power conversion efficiency reaches 24.5%. This discovery confirms the great value of volatile alkylammoniums in the preparation and stabilization of α-FAPbI3 perovskite films.",

While some advancements have been achieved in their synthetic development, the reaction mechanism, especially the precursor chemistry, of tin halide perovskite NCs remains poorly understood. Here, using cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3) perovskite NCs as a model system, we report on the mechanistic insight into the precursor chemistry of tin-based perovskite NCs through a combination of infrared, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We identify that the active intermediate complexes, polymeric alkanoate iodides that form via the reaction of the iodide source with oligomers present in the tin(II) carboxylates, play a key role in governing the reactivity of the tin iodide precursor, which leads to the variation in the size, size uniformity, and photoluminescence quantum yield of CsSnI3 NCs. Our work underscores the importance of understanding the precursor chemistry as a key parameter to design and synthesize tin halide perovskite NCs, which not only aids in their syntheses by design but also might benefit the fabrication of high-quality polycrystalline tin-based films.",

Herein, a synergistic approach combining the quantum transport method and machine learning algorithms has been devised to achieve the high-precision identification of DNA nucleotides. A model germanene nanogap is investigated for single-nucleotide-based DNA sequencing by calculating the transmission function and current–voltage characteristics. With the transmission function data sets, the Random Forest Classifier algorithm identified all four nucleotides and also demonstrated that binary, ternary, and quaternary combinations of nucleotides could also be classified with a high degree of precision, F1 score, and accuracy. The interelectrode distance analysis illustrates that transmission functions are sensitive to the electrode-nucleotide coupling effect and that the ML classifier can extrapolate the information during classification. Our findings provide a guide to the ML application on the nanogap device to achieve fast, cost-effective, and single-shot nucleotide identification.",

Combined with in situ/ex situ characterizations and DFT calculation, it is found that the CO2 resistance, surface hydration ability, and surface electrocatalytic activity toward P-ORR are significantly improved by B decoration. Importantly, the B element is found to raise the surface Brønsted acid (−OH) concentration yet depress the surface Lewis acidity, both of which are conducive to P-ORR reaction. At 600 °C, the maximum power density of the cell using 0.5B-PN as the cathode improved by 149.5% compared with that using the PN cathode.

Exploration on integrating multiple physical channels synchronously into materials has been long envisioned and pursued, because it can greatly enhance flexibility of information processing and recognition and improve the expansion of the application of materials in different fields. To achieve this end, a demanding set of material requirements must be met and remain a great challenge.

Compared to their racemic counterpart, besides the significant increase in phase-transition temperature (ΔT = 142 K), introducing homochirality enables bistable characteristics in thermal, dielectric, ferroelasticity, photoluminescence (PL), second harmonic generation (SHG), circular dichroism (CD), conductivity, and photocurrent response. Compared to traditional switchable phase-transition materials, such an unprecedented bistable response in eight channels involving thermal, electric, mechanical, and optical aspects brings more possibilities for sensing, smart switches, and optoelectronic applications.

This study examines two low-complexity thiophene copolymers with substituted benzooxadiazole (FO6-BO-T) or benzothiadiazole (FO6-T). Substituting sulfur with oxygen in FO6-BO-T increased its ionization energy without affecting the optical gap. When blended with the nonfullerene acceptor IDSe, FO6-BO-T showed a significantly lower dark current density (2.06·10–9 A cm–2 at −2 V) compared to FO6-T. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements demonstrated that pristine FO6-BO-T exhibited a more ordered morphology than FO6-T. However, blending resulted in a significant disruption to the ordered domains in both cases, with a loss of orientational order, suggesting that FO6-BO-T's improved performance is largely related to its increased ionization energy. This study demonstrates the potential of chalcogen atom engineering to enhance the performance of the OPD in scalable polymers.",

Herein, Mg2+ is doped into the Cu2O/CuO interface and generates high-activity Cu+–O-Mg2+ sites following electrochemical activation. The electron-withdrawing effect of Mg2+ in the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site stabilizes Cu+ and optimizes the reaction pathway for CO2RR. At a partial current density of 567.21 ± 5.18 mA cm–2, the Faraday efficiency (FE) for C2+ products can reach 81.03 ± 0.74%. In situ Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopy reveal that the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site significantly enhances the coverage and stability of *CO, which contributes to the ultrahigh selectivity of CO2 toward C2+ products. Density functional theory (DFT) studies indicate that *CO2 is readily adsorbed on the Cu+–O-Mg2+ site, facilitating the more effective generation of *CO, which subsequently promotes the electrochemical C–C coupling step and accelerates the production of C2+ products.",

We report our study of formation and evolution of the interphase layer in commercial carbonate electrolyte over cycles and as a function of additives, using Li||Cu cells as a model system. Side reactions with the electrolyte generate and continuously grow the interphase and set an unsatisfactory upper bound for the Coulombic efficiency. However, the cycle life of the cell is mostly determined by the structure and properties of the interphase layer. This understanding explains the positive additive effects observed in our prior work: Adding LiNO3 leads to a more porous and more ionically-conducting interphase layer and thus extends the cycle life; simultaneously adding LiNO3 and fluoroethylene carbonate reduces the reactivity of the electrolyte and thus improves the Coulombic efficiency.",

The accessibility of surface-confined DNA monolayers was programmed by engineering the lateral distances of DNA probes. In particular, we found that nucleases were effectively repelled from the biosensor surface by tuning the DNA density to 25.5 × 1012 molecules/cm2, equivalent to an interstrand lateral distance of ∼2 nm. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricated an electrochemical DNA aptamer sensor for detecting a small-molecule drug doxorubicin (Dox) that exhibited excellent stability and accuracy when deployed for monitoring Dox levels in whole blood. We thus expect the accessibility-programmable DNA biosensors to hold great potential for on-site biomarker analysis and drug monitoring.",

Recently, prolonged substitution is achieved by curtailing degradation-caused changes in the intraocular pressure, whereas a novel thermogel is presented that elicits the reformation of vitreous-like-body during the degradation process. In this Viewpoint, we envision that the latter methodology would pave a new path towards developing clinically-effective artificial vitreous. In line with this, we have outlined elementary guidelines on steering from prolonging substitution to eliciting regeneration and suggested several strategies of synthesizing regeneration-eliciting hydrogels, for researchers in the field of hydrogel-based artificial vitreous.",

However, the coverage of functional groups using this method has been limited by the amount of negative charge stored in the exfoliated MoS2 sheets to <25–30% per MoS2 unit. We report, herein, a reductant-activated functionalization, wherein one-electron metallocene reductants, such as nickelocene, octamethylnickelocene, and cobaltocene, are introduced during functionalization with methyl and propyl halides to tune the coverage of the alkyl groups. The reductant-activated functionalization yields functional group coverages up to 70%, ∼1.5–2 times higher than the previous limit, and enables functionalization by weak electrophiles, such as 1-chloropropane, that are otherwise unreactive with chemically exfoliated MoS2. We also explored the dependence of coverage on the strength of the leaving group and the steric hindrance of the alkyl halide in the absence of reductants and showed that functionalization was ineffective for chloride leaving groups and for secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides. These results demonstrate a substantial increase in coverage compared to functionalization without reductants, and may impact the performance of these materials in applications reliant on surface interactions. Furthermore, this method may be applicable to the covalent functionalization of similar layered materials and metal chalcogenides.",

Here, we report a high-κ dielectric, optically transparent, mechanically strong and flexible dielectric polymer produced by in situ formation of biaxial ferroelectric-molecule-modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The composite film was fabricated by solution casting of a PVA solution containing water-soluble dielectric crystals [Hdabco]ClO4. Atomic force microscopic and polarized optical microscopic studies showed a uniform dispersion of TEDA.C crystals with tunable rod-like or dendritic microstructures in the PVA matrix. Because of the good compatibility and hydrogen bonds between PVA and TDEA.C, the modified PVA films presented a significant enhancement of the dielectric constant and energy storage density by 10–100-fold over neat PVA. The polarization-electric loops indicated that the PVA composite films possessed increased saturation polarization in comparison to neat PVA film. The remnant polarization of PVA composite films was improved by around 3200 times with 9 wt % TEDA.C. Also, the TEDA.C@PVA films exhibited 85% transparency throughout the visible spectrum, 116% increase in storage modulus, and 274% elongation at fracture. These unprecedented high-κ dielectric, optical, and mechanical properties may break the restrictions in the applications of traditional ferroelectric materials and greatly expand the usage of dielectric polymers in broad fields.",

In the present study, we, for the first time, demonstrate PDC-assisted experimental determination of an uninvestigated phase diagram for the deposition of Zn–Sn–P films by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Interestingly, without any background knowledge of materials science, an undetected phase in the initial dataset was detected after only 4 cycles of PDC-assisted experiments, and the phase diagram was sufficiently refined after only 11 cycles. Based on the results and thermodynamic discussions, we confirm the effectiveness of PDC on the construction of phase diagrams for MBE process. The demonstration in this study shows the machine-learning method, PDC, will accelerate discovery and development of materials; furthermore, we discuss how to use PDC more effectively, considering the objectives involved in the construction of phase diagrams.",

Tuning the nucleation and growth behavior of Li plating process is, therefore, essential to tackle the dendrite growth problem. Here, we demonstrate a flaky and dense Li growth behavior simply by creating a nanoporous Cu layer on the surface of Li metal anode. High-resolution SEM and AFM measurements reveal that the Li deposits first nucleate as nanoflakes within the pores of Cu layer, then these flakes continuously grow thicker until they fuse together and eventually evolve into an ultra-smooth and dense Li layer. Such a unique Li growth behavior is derived from the nanoporous Cu surface layer, which triggers a synergistic regulation of the electrodeposition kinetics by providing a uniformly distributed electric field, sufficiently enhanced Li+ diffusion flux, and also appropriately regulated lithium nucleation kinetics. As a result, stable cycling of the Li|Li symmetric cell and Li metal full cells (Li|LTO/LFP/NCM) can be achieved under high current densities and high deposition capacities. These findings illustrate the feasibility to tailor the Li deposition microstructure, which help to create a highly reversible, nondendritic, and safer Li metal anode for LMB applications.",

A key aspect is the strong link between structural and electronic properties, which can be modified by interfacing materials with distinct lattice symmetries. Here, we determine the effect of the cubic-tetragonal distortion of SrTiO3 on the electronic properties of thin films of SrIrO3, a topological crystalline metal hosting a delicate interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electronic correlations. We demonstrate that below the transition temperature at 105 K, SrIrO3 orthorhombic domains couple directly to tetragonal domains in SrTiO3. This forces the in-phase rotational axis to lie in-plane and creates a binary domain structure in the SrIrO3 film. The close proximity to the metal–insulator transition in ultrathin SrIrO3 causes the individual domains to have strongly anisotropic transport properties, driven by a reduction of bandwidth along the in-phase axis. The strong structure–property relationships in perovskites make these compounds particularly suitable for static and dynamic coupling at interfaces, providing a promising route towards realizing novel functionalities in oxide heterostructures.",

Herein, with the merit of the energy level alignment between the carbon nanodots (CDs) and the energy-rich intermediate generated in the peroxalate system, we design a facile controllable nitrogen doping route to prepare CDs for high-brightness CL. The increased amount of trigonal nitrogen restructures the CDs from a graphitic carbon core to a β-C3N4 core, which triggers the lifting of the highest occupied molecular orbital and further promotes the electron exchange between the CDs and intermediate agents. Meanwhile, the restructured bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals lead to the tunable CL emission wavelength. Thus, a maximal luminance of 4.35 cd m–2 has been achieved in the CL CDs with high nitrogen content, which is the highest value ever reported previously.

In this work, a data set containing processing information and mobility values of 115 DPP-DTT-based organic field effect transistors (OFET) was constructed from 15 publications. A customized classification algorithm was applied to the data set to help identify a reduced design region for polymer solution concentration that would be more likely to result in improved hole mobility. Experiments performed to confirm the insights from the data curation exercise revealed a strong influence of solution concentration on the polymer chain excitonic interactions and electronic performance. Devices fabricated at the critical chain overlap concentration of 5 g/L in chlorobenzene resulted in improved hole mobility, and were in good agreement with the insights provided by the classification algorithm.",

Nanocellulose-based materials have triggered extensive attention in the development of advanced LSBs, because of their abundant source, good biodegradability and renewability, excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and flexible chemical tunability. In this perspective, we first present the fundamental operating principle and outline the main challenges of LSBs. Subsequently, the structure and properties of nanocellulose are briefly summarized, and the main research advancements of nanocellulose and its derivatives toward advanced LSBs are comprehensively reviewed. At last, the outlook with regard to the development of nanocellulose-based materials and their application in LSBs is provided.",

The perhaps best known MXene, namely, Ti3C2Tx, has been observed to stack in two distinct ways, and simulations show that this influences interlayer bonding energy and Li diffusion. In this DFT study, six types of Ti3C2T2 interlayer bonds resulting from O, F, and OH termination groups are assessed with respect to stability. It is shown that OH termination groups are highly stable up to 50% coverage, but unstable for higher coverage. A model to predict stacking type based on termination group chemistry shows that the degree of hydrogen bonding is the deciding factor. The model is also tested on V2CT2 and Zr3C2T2, giving similar results to those of Ti3C2T2. By calculating migration barriers for Ti3C2O2, we show that Li, Na, and Mg have orders of magnitude faster diffusion in the stacking favored by hydrogen bonds. XRD patterns calculated for both stackings show they are close to indistinguishable, highlighting the need for caution when classifying stacking.",

Here, we demonstrate an approach to develop an analytical relationship between 2D COF lateral (in-plane) growth rates and fundamental microscopic processes, based on a previously reported kinetic Monte Carlo model. The bond formation rate, the relative bond formation rates at crystal faces and edges, and the lattice size are all found to be critical parameters for the determination of the lateral growth rates. Our analysis also reveals the importance of self-templation in 2D COF growth, which provides a unified understanding of supramolecular interactions in 2D polymerization. Our analytical model represents an important step toward a generalized mechanistic understanding of 2D COF formation. Also, the quantitative description provided here opens the way to monomer design and polymerization conditions that favor lateral growth.",

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown the potential to complete these challenging separations by utilizing pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) as a sustainable alternative to current cryogenic distillation techniques. To rationally design materials to better realize this goal, two main approaches have emerged: pore-size optimized and polarizability-based separations. To ascertain the efficacy of these strategies, we designed a series of UiO-type MOFs with terphenyl linkers that systematically varied their steric and electronic properties, including −Me, −F, −TMS, and −I functionalities, to assess their interactions with xenon and krypton. The prepared MOFs are all isoreticular and have similar pore size distributions, allowing us to directly evaluate the effects imposed by the functional groups. We found that the xenon uptake could be increased with greater polarizability of the functional group (−F < −Me ≈ −TMS < −I), whereas the selectivities seem to follow a trend more related to pore-steric effects (−TMS < −I < −Me < −F).",

In this study, we report aqueous MnO2–Cr (Bi) batteries with excellent electrochemical performance that are achieved via the electrolyte regulation of Bi3+ for both the MnO2 cathode and liquid-state Cr anode reactions. Compared with the pristine MnO2–Cr cell, the electrochemical performance of the MnO2–Cr (Bi) cell regulated by the Bi3+ in the electrolyte is significantly improved. Specifically, our MnO2–Cr (Bi) full cell exhibits a low overpotential of 89 mV, a discharge voltage of 1.55 V, and high energy efficiency of 91.4% at relatively low rates. Moreover, a stable lifetime of 12 000 cycles at a rate of 200 C and an ultrahigh rate of 400 C with a discharge plateau above 1 V is achieved. The exciting results demonstrate that the aqueous MnO2–Cr (Bi) cells are of great interest for the deployment of economical and practical batteries for large-scale energy storage applications.",

Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of 2,6-azulene-based conjugated copolymers P(AzIDT-C6), P(AzIDT-PhC6), and P(AzIDTT-PhC6) containing electron-rich indacenodithiophene (IDT) units. Because of the electron-rich features of IDT moieties, all polymers can be easily protonated in both solution and solid state. The protonation states can reach saturation with as little as 0.5% volume ratio of trifluoroacetic acid in solution accompanied by a substantial red-shift (>250 nm) in the UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra, which is the most sensitive proton responsiveness among reported azulene-based polymers. The proton responsiveness of these polymers in thin films is shown to be dynamically reversible with the color changing between deep blue (neutral state) and colorless (protonated state) due to shifting of the absorption bands between the visible and near-infrared regions. Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments reveal that the protonated polymers can be further oxidized to form radical cations with strong EPR signals. A membrane containing 3 wt % P(AzIDTT-PhC6) in Nafion shows a 72.2% higher conductivity than Nafion at 125 °C and 0% relative humidity, implying the potential application of these polymers in polymer electrolyte membranes. Preliminary organic field-effect transistor studies suggest that all conjugated polymers investigated display typical p-channel transport behavior with hole mobilities up to 0.46 cm2 V–1 s–1, demonstrating that the 2,6-azulene-based conjugated copolymers can behave as p-type semiconducting materials. Our work indicates that the incorporation of electron-rich large π-conjugated units into 2,6-azulene-based conjugated polymers is an effective strategy to develop highly sensitive proton-responsive materials and high-performance hole-transporting semiconductors.",

There have been many metal halide ferroelectrics discovered thus far; however, their structural design is heavily centralized on the perovskite prototype which largely hampers the expansion of the landscape of these emerging molecular systems. Herein, we report the synthesis and structure of a new hybrid metal halide ferroelectric, (TMS)2CdI4 (TMS = trimethylsulfonium), which has an ammonium sulfate-type structure. This material undergoes a first-order paraelectric to ferroelectric transition which is driven by the order–disorder of the TMS cations similar to the scenario in ammonium sulfate. Notably, this transition involves a giant uniaxial spontaneous strain up to 13.1% which has very rarely been observed in molecular ferroelectrics.

Heretofore, most solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations have focused on readily accessible nuclei. In contrast, the halogen environments have been avoided due to their challenging quadrupolar nature. Here, we report a rapid 35/37Cl NMR strategy for MHPs, halide double perovskites (HDPs), and perovskite-inspired (PI) materials embracing ultra-wideline acquisition approaches at moderate and ultrahigh magnetic fields. The observed quadrupolar NMR parameters (CQ and η), supported by GIPAW–DFT computations, provide an analytical fingerprint revealing distinct features for chemically unique Cl environments sensitive to ion mixing, dimensionality, cell volume, and Cl coordinating polyhedra. Moreover, we report resolution between two nearly identical and two distinct Cl environments of 3D and 2D Cs-based lead halide perovskites, respectively. These results reveal a strategy for a routine and robust spectroscopic approach to analyze local Cl chemical environments in metal halide perovskites that can be extended broadly to other halogen-containing semiconductors.",

However, the lack of stable, bright, and biocompatible molecular fluorophores becomes a major barrier on the way to the widespread endorsement of NIR-II bioimaging for clinic diagnosis. Here we propose a π-conjugated \"crossbreeding\" dyad strategy to develop novel desirable NIR-II dyes, flavchromenes (flav+chromene) integrated from two individual fluorophores of flavylium and chromene via a short methine bridge, affording valuable features of extending spectra into the NIR-II region and conferring a substantive leap in the photophysical properties. Notably, these crossbreeding NIR-II dyes have small molecular weights, high molar extinction coefficients, and outstanding chemical stability. As demonstrated, the elaborated probe Flavchrom-4 endows activatable dual-modal in vivo imaging of endogenous β-galactosidase activity, along with lighting-up NIR-II fluorescence signals and dramatically enhanced photoacoustic signals (16.3-fold). This concise π-conjugated crossbreeding dyad strategy brings forth high-performance NIR-II fluorophore scaffolds with small molecular weights, high stability, and good brightness, thus greatly expanding high-resolution activatable in vivo imaging tools for intact tissues and living animals.",

    "abstract": "Solid-state Na+ and Li+ batteries are promising energy storage technologies, suggesting increased operational safety due to the replacement of the flammable organic electrolyte with a nonflammable solid-electrolyte, leading to a significant advantage over conventional battery systems. While the thermal properties of conventional battery systems are studied extensively, the thermal properties of solid-state batteries and their components often remain elusive, and, consequently, not much is known about thermal runaway in solid systems. Moreover, these battery systems are often composed of complex multiphase components, e.g., the cathode composite consisting of solid electrolyte, active material, coatings and additives, which are of significant importance for their performance. Consequently, modeling of the thermal and ionic transport properties of such multiphase components is of tremendous interest. An often-neglected fact is that porosity has an additional influence on their transport. In order to shed light onto some of these issues, both the thermal conductivity and the ionic conductivity of the model ionic conductor Na3PS4 are characterized as a function of porosity and evaluated using the Bruggemann model of the (differential) effective medium theory. It is found that the Bruggemann power-law (tortuosity factor) describing the density dependence differs significantly between thermal and ionic conductivity. This is unexpected within the current paradigm of the effective medium theory and motivates further study. Moreover, it is confirmed that Na3PS4, despite its relatively simple crystal structure, has an astonishingly low thermal conductivity, comparable to common thermoelectric materials and thermal barrier coatings, which can be explained by the diffusive nature of thermal transport by so-called \"diffusons\" rather than the usually known phonon transport.",

To get rid of it, several efforts have been made in the past few years. Among recent theoretical works, TiO2 has been suggested as a suitable buffer layer due to its optical and electrical properties, giving extremely promising results in device simulation. However, there are few experimental examples combining TiO2 with kesterite, and they generally show very modest performances. In this Letter, we report on the preliminary and promising results of our experimental procedure for the production of Cd-free kesterite photovoltaic devices featuring ALD-TiO2 as a buffer layer, leading to efficiencies comparable with our CZTS/CdS reference devices.",

Thus, identifying topological differences to investigate polymorphs in MOFs is of great significance for obtaining phase-pure material. Herein, we demonstrate that fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is a powerful and nondestructive technique for direct analysis of polymorphs in MOFs by using NU-1000 as a model system. By utilizing intrinsic fluorescence from pyrene-tetracarboxylate based linkers, NU-901 is identified as the structural isomer present within NU-1000. The amount of NU-901 phase is shown to be dependent on the identity of the carboxylic acid modulator used for the synthesis of NU-1000. Moreover, both confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) and FLIM identified the presence of NU-901 phase at the center of the crystallites, whereas more NU-1000 phase was observed at both terminus. This work shows the great potential of FLIM in identifying phase impurities in representative samples of NU-1000, that can be easily extrapolated to other MOFs.",

The commonly seen anisotropic dyeing of solution-grown crystals, promoted by specific dye–facet interactions, limits their optical applicability. Here, two classic dyes, methylene blue (MLB) and aniline blue (ALB), are each isotropic occluded within single crystals of the widely used NLO material, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). MLB and ALB, which only partially stain solution-grown KDP crystals, are incorporated isotropically into gel-grown crystals with unspoiled single-crystalline lattices. During the gel crystallization, dye molecules bind to the gel-networks, and both become incorporated into the crystals, leading to efficient isotropic dyeing. Furthermore, enrichment of dye molecules from gels into crystals is achieved in the case of ALB because the ALB molecules bind strongly and accumulate onto the gel-networks. Hence, this work provides a generally applicable strategy to facilitate the isotropic dyeing of single crystals and further optimization of crystal properties.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with fully conjugated nitrogen-enriched architectures is a long-term challenging subject. Herein, a solvent- and catalyst-free approach was implemented for the first time to create crystalline CTFs based on a new trimerization of amidine-type monomers. A highly crystalline triazine-linked polymer with a specific surface area of 255 m2 g–1 was achieved, whereas additional aldehydes were no longer required. Furthermore, an in situ transformation strategy was developed by exploring a molten salt (ZnCl2) to promote this new condensation, so as to convert as-obtained CTFs into isolated single-atom catalysts (SACs). Interestingly, the usage of ZnCl2 not only enables a crystalline CTF with a significantly enhanced surface area, up to 663 m2 g–1 but also provides a means of realizing atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts with unique Ni–N3–C sites. As a result, the resulting SAC exhibits efficient electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction performance, where a maximum Faradaic efficiency for carbon monoxide (CO) production of 97.5% at −0.52 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and an excellent turnover frequency (3192 h–1) with a current density of 23.32 mA cm–2 at −1.02 V can be obtained, respectively. We anticipate our findings will facilitate new possibilities for the development of crystalline porous organic frameworks and SACs for various catalysis.",

In this study, we observed degradation process in CH3NH3PbI3 crystals by using the in situ 2D wide-angle X-ray scattering technique by simultaneously exposing the perovskite crystals to light and humidity, and revealed the degradation process based on crystallography. We found that NH4PbI3·2H2O was formed during the degradation process under these conditions. The results indicated that CH3NH3I and NH4PbI3·2H2O suppressed the degradation of the perovskite crystals to PbI2. Thus, we revealed one of the complicated degradation processes that occur upon simultaneous light and humidity exposure. The results of this study suggest that the protection of perovskite crystals from water molecules is crucial for improving the photodurability of perovskite solar cells.",

Subsequent analysis revealed that the polymeric HTM with the longest OEG side groups improved the number of hole transport carriers and passivated traps at the perovskite/HTM interface. This is attributed to the effective interaction with the perovskite layer and the formation of face-on-oriented crystallites.

The targeted cyclooctatetraene-embedded perylene diimide dimers, namely, sila- and disila-annulated double π-helices (3 and 4), are synthesized via one-pot palladium-catalyzed Si–C bond formation. Single-crystal analyses reveal their unique double π-helical frameworks featuring a cyclobis[3]helicene substructure with enhanced structural rigidity and coplanarity by Si-heteroannulation. Enhanced fluorescence emission is thus achieved with ΦPL reaching 70%, which is attributed to the mitigation of nonradiative energy loss revealed by the theoretical results of reorganization energy and Huang–Rhys factors. Notably, the symmetrically bilateral disila-annulated double π-helix 4 exhibit excellent chiral activities both in the ground and excited states, with dissymmetry factors |gabs| of up to 0.015, |glum| of up to 0.013, and CPL brightness (BCPL) of 207.3 M–1 cm–1, outperforming pristine double π-helix 2.

As a key feature, the Co–N4 affects the Li deposition behavior with axial Li growth on the surfaces of the carbon frameworks, while the other heteroatoms (i.e., nitrogen defects) induce vertical Li growth. By combining theoretical calculations and experiments, this detailed investigation widens the scope of future research on carbon host materials for practical usage of Li metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "Environmentally friendly hybrid Sn–Pb-based perovskite solar cells (PCSs) have made great progress recently. However, the serious Sn (II)/I vacancy defects within perovskite film due to poor thermodynamic stability and strong reaction activity of Sn (II) still limit the efficiency and stability of Sn–Pb-based PSCs. In this work, we proposed a PEAAc post-treatment method to mitigate successfully this problem. Sn–Pb-based perovskite films were post-treated by phenethylamine acetate (PEAAc) to form a 2D layered structure on the surface of 3D perovskite film, which passivates the defects on the surface and at the grain boundary of the 3D perovskite and blocks the erosion of water and oxygen. In addition, the coordinate energy of Ac– with Sn2+/Pb2+ is larger than I–, which effectively inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+ and suppresses the ionic migration. Besides, the introduction of PEAAc also modifies the band energy alignment at the perovskite interface. Benefiting from these roles of PEAAc, the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of the device are largely improved. As a result, the best device after PEAAc passivation achieves the open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.79 V, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of 29.31 mA/cm2, and the fill factor (FF) of 0.75, and thus the PCE of 18.36% (the champion PCE of control device is only 14.75%). In addition, the PSCs treated by PEAAc can still maintain 60% of the initial efficiency stored in nitrogen after 700 h.",

Compared with the various transfer methods that have been used previously for multilayer stacking, this direct-growth method has the advantages of producing cleaner interfaces and the capability of growing tunable layers on target substrates, thereby making it more suitable for manufacturing processes. The WS2 bilayer displayed uniform optical properties, with the atomic arrangement between layers having an AA stacking order that are supposed to have higher mobility. We adopted these WS2 monolayers and bilayers in field-effect transistors. Accordingly, this approach for highly area-selective growth of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and bilayers with metal pads and their in situ conversion appears to provide effective platforms for further device applications.",

However, its efficiency is usually affected by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Nanocarriers with the ability to relieve hypoxia have been widely investigated. Here, a new kind of PDT nanocarrier with oxygen saving ability was developed by functionally coassembling a mitochondrial-targeting photosensitizer and an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. The nanophotosensitizers were found to accumulate in lysosomes in the beginning. The acidic environment of lysosomes can break down the nanocarriers. The released photosensitizers can enter mitochondria. Meanwhile the released inhibitor can inhibit the glycolytic process and save oxygen for PDT occurring within mitochondria. The concordance of oxygen saving and smart releasing–translocating photosensitizers from lysosomes to mitochondria proved to be a good strategy for the enhancement of PDT efficiency.",

    "abstract": "A highly conductive copper iodide (CuI) film with excellent thermoelectric (TE) performance was simply prepared by using the solution-processable spray printing technique for the fabrication of transparent and flexible TE generators (TEGs). Compensating for sublimation- or evaporation-induced iodine loss during the spray printing process, the addition of a small amount (1 at. %) of iodine (I2) into the CuI precursor solution was dramatically effective for obtaining CuI films showing the excellent electrical conductivity of 207.6 S·cm–1 and power factor of 673.3 μW·m–1·K–2, resulting in a high zT value of 0.31. Importantly, added I2 played a critical role in increasing the electrical conductivity by providing iodide to improve the Cu to I stoichiometry in the CuI films and improve crystallite growth. Using 1 at. % I2 doping, two different flexible TEGs (one coiled and one foldable) were successfully fabricated that showed a high output power density of 236.5 μW·cm–2 at a temperature gradient of 22 °C and high sensitivity to small temperature changes induced by a halogen lamp, respectively. This efficient and facile approach to fabricating solution-processable transparent conductors with high TE performance suggests potential applicability to the development of energy-harvesting windows or screens.",

    "abstract": "Particle–support interaction has been recognized as a driving force for improving catalytic performance. To achieve this unique interaction, the common synthetic strategy is to load the active noble-metal particles onto a specific supporter. Due to the surface features and the sheetlike geometry, two-dimensional (2D) metal oxides are promising supporters for metal particle loading, resulting in the stable interfacial binding and the reduced charge transfer distance. Herein, three different types of 2D-based vanadium oxide supporters are proposed to be synthesized by using a controllable self-assembly approach. After the loading of active iridium nanoparticles, it is concluded that the optimal geometry for superior catalytic kinetics is the 2D one, which is primarily contributed by the strongest Ir–V–O interaction over particle–support interfaces. This work will provide some new insights into the particle–support interaction mechanisms and offer a possible solution for optimizing the electrocatalytic kinetics by adjusting the geometry of the supporter.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic performance of a catalyst is mainly determined by its surface structure, and superior catalytic activities have been observed on low-coordination surface sites. However, poor stability of low-coordination sites was observed during catalysis due to easier oxidation of these sites. By far, fabricating the catalysts with abundant low-coordination sites and stabilizing them still faces a significant challenge. Herein, we show the synthesis of an emerging type of PdPt alloy nanoframe wherein the ridges are composed of rugged surfaces with high-density, low-coordination sites. The synthesis of nanoframes mainly consists of two steps: preparation of PdPt alloy concave nanocubes and subsequent site-selective chemical etching. The nanoframe structure would endow low-coordination sites with excellent catalytic stability, preventing dissolution, migration, and aggregation of these active sites during catalysis. Electrochemical studies on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis show that it can deliver superior mass activities tens of times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts in a broad pH range (from 1 to 13), with negligible activity decay after 40 000 cycles. In addition, as-prepared nanoframes can also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward methanol and ethanol oxidation reactions, with mass activities up to 19.55 and 28.96 A/mgPd+Pt, respectively, which are 19 and 47 times that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of PdPt alloy components and high-density, low-coordination sites both is important for enhanced catalytic activities. This new strategy to stabilize the low-coordination sites on Pt-based electrocatalysts by constructing frame structures would shed new light on the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts.",

Since electrical conduction is thought to occur through the ligand π-system, but aromaticity itself results in stabilized π-electrons, the delocalization of ligand wavefunctions should be inversely related to the ligand π-stability. That is, aromatic π-electrons should prefer to localize on a single linker rather than delocalize to form a curved band in the MOF. Here, we use a combination of NICS-xy scans and bulk electronic band structure calculations to show that the extent of residual aromaticity in the oxidized linker is a good predictor for electronic localization in the resultant MOF. Thus, ligands that feature antiaromatic π-systems in the oxidation state found within the MOF should yield increased band curvature, a target parameter that affects charge mobility in high performing electrical conductors.",

Herein, we report porous organic cage crystals (NKPOC-1-α) of a flexible–robust nature for the efficient separation of C2H2/C2H4 mixtures. The intrinsic porosity of the organic cage and extrinsic porosity of stacking for C2H2 account for its high uptake capacity and selectivity, as evidenced by the large-amplitude continuous-breathing behavior for C2H2 adsorption experiments. But for C2H4, the breathing behavior comes only from the extrinsic porosity and not from the intrinsic porosity of the organic cage, which has been proved by adsorption experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, NKPOC-1-α adsorbs a large amount of C2H2 through a gate opening and only a negligible amount of C2H4 at 253 and 273 K. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that this flexible, robust material can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/C2H4 mixtures. Furthermore, NKPOC-1-α is the first POC crystal to exhibit selective adsorption of C2H2 over C2H4, which provides a new direction for the rational design of POCs for industrial gas separations.",

    "abstract": "The flammability and brittleness of unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) were two serious problems that limited its application in high-precision fields. Here, the rod-shaped hydroxyapatite (HAP) was anchored on the surface of hydroxylated black phosphorus nanosheets (BP–OH) through a hydrothermal reaction to obtain a highly stable black phosphorus-based nano flame retardant (BP–OH@HAP). Owing to the exposure of many hydroxyl groups, BP–OH@HAP was well dispersed in the UPR matrix, and UPR nanocomposites with 0.5 wt % BP–OH@HAP realized a 71% increase in impact strength. The presence of BP–OH@HAP also greatly inhibited the combustion of UPR nanocomposites. In detail, the UPR composites with 2 wt % BP–OH@HAP achieved a 47.0% decrease in peak heat release rate (PHRR) along with 23.1% reductions in total heat release (THR), revealing the excellent ability of BP–OH@HAP to inhibit polymer combustion. In addition, UPR/BP–OH@HAP 2.0 achieved a 46 s increase in the time to PHRR (tPHRR) and a 62% reduction in the fire growth index (FGI), indicating that the fire spread of UPR/BP–OH@HAP 2.0 was significantly suppressed. Therefore, this work obtained the UPR/BP–OH@HAP nanocomposite with high fire safety through the innovation of inorganic nanotechnology, which provided new research ideas for improving the toughness and flame-retardant properties of UPR-based nanocomposites.",

    "abstract": "The demand for a sustainable power supply and management has become increasingly essential with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the associated wireless sensor networks. Inorganic thermoelectric thin films, such as those based on Bi2S3, are becoming a viable solution to this issue as they are low-toxic, inexpensive, and possess a high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity. However, they usually suffer from an inherent low electrical conductivity. In this study, we tackled this problem by incorporating Cl into Bi2S3 lattices using a solution process, resulting in a substantial increase in both the conductivity and carrier concentration. Additionally, DFT calculations show that the doping of Cl leads to the formation of a degenerate semiconductor, which increases conductivity. Moreover, a high power factor of 121.88 μW m–1 K–2 was achieved after doping before plasma treatment. Specifically, the Bi2S3 sample doped with 0.5 mmol of BiCl3 with plasma treatment achieved a remarkable conductivity of 100.72 S cm–1, among the highest reported for a Bi2S3-based system, which is attributed to the sharp increase of carrier concentration. This research demonstrates a promising approach for overcoming the inherently low conductivity of Bi2S3-based thermoelectric thin films to enable them as a viable solution for low-cost power supply in IoT applications.",

    "abstract": "The insufficient hole injection and excess electron injection unfortunately result in inferior performance in blue QLEDs. To study the predominant factors for hole injection, six different hole transport materials were investigated. The smaller energy barrier between the hole transport layer (HTL) and QDs dominates the injection, and high hole mobility further accelerates the process, which qualifies 4,4′-bis(3-vinyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP-V) as the most suitable HTL matrix. Simultaneously, moderate electron mobility reduction is also needed, which could be realized by PVP doping in the ZnO electron transport layer (ETL). The highly hole-mobile poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-(3-methylpropyl))diphenylamine) (TFB) was wrapped in the cross-linked CPB-V framework to further improve hole mobility and hole injection. The high level charge balance after the matching of 20 wt % TFB:CBP-V and 0.75 wt % PVP:ZnO enables high-performance blue QLEDs, with the EQE reaching 17.11% and the lifetime of 216 h at 100 cd/m2. Our investigation builds a general principle of both HTL and ETL material regulation for high-level injection balance.",

However, current experimental models are limited in accurately dissecting the effect of mechanical and topographical properties on cancer cell migration in a confined three-dimensional (3D) environment. In this study, we propose a facile strategy to produce precisely controlled channel-like hydrogel confinements on a microfluidic device via a \"hydrogel-in-hydrogel\" two-photon 3D printing approach. Within this model, it is demonstrated that breast cancer cells migrate faster in the stiffer confinements with an adapted migratory phenotype, and the transcriptomic profile of the migrating cells shows that the activation of YAP is involved in this process. This platform allows the fabrication of high-resolution hydrogel microstructures, real-time observation of the cell–environmental interplay, and convenient collection of migrating cell samples for sequencing analyses, which provides a powerful tool for investigating cell migration and mechanical interactions within a confined microenvironment.",

MOF/PUF composites were prepared using MIL-160(Al) and UiO-66(Zr)-(CF3)2 via one step process where the MOFs particles are incorporated during the foam matrix formation. Under adjusted conditions, the composite materials maintained the shape and characteristics of the MOF material, good mechanical stability, and good accessibility to the pores without significantly compromising the VOCs adsorption capacity for hexane, acetone, methanol, toluene, and acetic acid. This methodology proved the possibility of incorporating high amounts of shaped MOF particles, reaching 200% (w/w) of foam, upon maintaining a considerable open-cell volume percentage (32%). As an application perspective, we demonstrate that the composites can overcome the challenge of acetic acid capture in the presence of ambient moisture with a similar performance to the pure MOF. Thus, VOCs capture through MOF/polyurethane foam composites is a promising environmental technology to eliminate air pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has played a huge role in interventional therapy and tumor embolization of organ hemorrhage and accidental hemorrhage. The selection of embolic materials with better biocompatibility is an important part of TAE. In this work, we prepared a gelatin microspheres (GMs) embolization material that simultaneously encapsulates silver sulfide quantum dots (Ag2S QDs) and barium sulfate (BaSO4), giving it good near-infrared second region (NIR-II) imaging and X-ray imaging effects, while luminescence effect of NIR-II is better than that of X-ray, which breaks the limitation of traditional embolization microspheres with only X-ray imaging. In order to improve the therapeutic effect on tumors, we loaded doxorubicin (DOX) antitumor drugs inside the microspheres and bound thrombin on the surface of the microspheres. Thereby, not only can it help achieve rapid embolization during hemostasis, but its sustained release can also accelerate tumor necrosis. The microspheres have good biocompatibility and blood compatibility. Preliminary application results show that the microspheres can achieve a good embolization effect in the ear artery and renal artery of New Zealand white rabbits.

    "abstract": "The development of drug delivery strategies with the desired immunomodulation effects to alleviate tumor drug resistance remains a challenge. Herein, low-generation poly(alkylideneamine) dendrimer nanogels (DNGs) were developed to codeliver chemotherapeutics 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and immune agonist cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) for tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The DNGs possess a hydrodynamic size of 145.6 nm, excellent drug/nucleotide coloading capacity, and pH-sensitive drug release profile. The 5-FU-loaded DNGs can overcome 5-FU resistance through prolonged cellular retention and downregulation of P-glycoprotein expression on the cancer cell surface. Meanwhile, the cGAMP in the codelivery system can activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway in cancer cells, which further relives drug resistance and modulates tumor microenvironment through maturation of dendritic cells and macrophage M1 polarization. The immunomodulation-facilitated drug resistance alleviation was confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous colorectal tumor mouse model, leading to relatively long tumor drug retention, inhibition of tumor growth, and generation of active antitumor immune responses.",

A shortcoming of many additive manufacturing processes is the reliance on organic materials that are not durable long-term, in many cases being both chemically and thermally unstable. Conversely, additive manufacturing approaches that feature more-robust inorganic materials require expensive and high-temperature (>1000 °C) processing steps, which often limits their final use to one single function. Here, we describe a materials platform that enables the additive manufacturing of inorganic glass composite structures at low temperatures (<250 °C), with chemical and thermal stability comparable to traditional silicon dioxide-based materials. Due to the low temperature processing, a wide range of materials (dielectrics, metals, optical) can be embedded into the glass to create multifunctional glass structures. Since no specialized tooling is needed and the source materials are commercially available, we expect this approach to be easily adopted for prototyping glass/ceramic objects and structures.",

In this context, we examined stiffness trends among different classes of 2D materials and identified the elastic constants pivotal for estimating the 2D material stiffness irrespective of their crystal symmetry. Subsequently, we developed Gaussian Process Regression machine learning models with the capability of relative stiffness comparison, which are used to predict high stiffness candidates across a broad spectrum of unseen 2D materials during model training. The probability of finding high stiffness 2D materials increased significantly, from a mere 1% in the training data set to a notable 47% in the set of machine learning-predicted 2D materials. We also discussed potential stiffening mechanisms, competing stiffness characteristics, and complementary properties of these predicted high-stiffness 2D materials that are crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of the aforementioned applications.",

    "abstract": "The development of new and more efficient vaccination approaches is a constant need, due to the pressure of historical and emerging infectious diseases and the limited efficacy and universality of the current vaccination technologies. Peptides and recombinant proteins have been explored for decades as subunit vaccines for bacterial and viral infections, presented either as soluble protein species or as virus-like assemblies. Recently, synthetic secretory protein-only microscale granules have been developed as dynamic depots for sustained protein release. They are based on the reversible coordination between ionic Zn and histidine residues, which promotes a fast formation of granular particles in vitro out of soluble protein and a slow release of such building block protein in vivo through the physiological chelation of the metal. Such an endocrine-like platform represents a new drug delivery system fully validated in oncology by which soluble and functional protein drugs are progressively released from the granules and made available for antitumor activities upon subcutaneous administration. By exploring such an approach for immunization here, microparticles made of a recombinant form of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were tested as an antigen delivery system for induction of antibody responses against the virus upon administration of the material in the absence of added adjuvants. Also, the comparison between protein materials produced in bacterial, mammalian, or insect cell factories has demonstrated a moderate impact of protein glycosylation on the final immunological performance of the system. Therefore, we propose the consideration of synthetic protein secretory granules as a new sustainable immunization platform based on fully manageable, self-organized, and self-formulated immunogens, aimed at reducing the dosage, costs, and complexity of vaccination regimens.",

Moreover, the adhesive exhibits good stability after 10 cycles of rapid cooling and heating between −196–50 °C. Finally, the mechanism behind the excellent bonding was verified, which stems from the strong polarity of the hard segments and the hardening of the soft segments.",

    "abstract": "The excellent light absorption and nonvolatilization nature of triiodide cesium lead (CsPbI3) make it a promising candidate for high-performance photovoltaics, but the efficiency of CsPbI3 photovoltaics is still limited by severe open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss caused by nonradiative recombination. Herein, a quinoid polymer (named PAQM-TPD) is used as a dual-functional buffer layer to optimize the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer for reducing the VOC loss and broadening the light response in CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Introducing PAQM-TPD induces Lewis acid–base interactions with CsPbI3 to form a stable heterointerface on top of the CsPbI3 crystal, which can passivate defects and extend the spectral response range. In addition, PAQM-TPD featuring high mobility and matching energy-level alignment generated by the CsPbI3/PAQM-TPD heterointerface provides a good driving force for hole transport, reducing the energy loss at the interface. Consequently, the comprehensive interface optimization results in the β-CsPbI3 PSCs achieving an efficiency of 19.98% and the highest current density (20.98 mA cm–2), with a low energy loss of 0.496 eV. Long alkyl side chains in the quinoid polymer also prevent water ingress and stabilize the perovskite heterointerface. Devices treated with PAQM-TPD retained 91% of their initial efficiency after 720 h of storage in an ambient air environment.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a functional method to achieve surface passivation and construct a two-dimensional (2D) layer on a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, eliminating the need for subsequent annealing steps. A key process is the integration of a single methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) crystal with butylammonium iodide (BAI) in tetrahydrofuran. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the synergy between BA+ cations and Pb–I octahedral structures enables the formation of a distinct 2D layered framework. MA+ and BA+ exhibit adsorption energies of −5.519 and −5.925 eV, respectively, at MA vacancies on the perovskite surface. This finding indicates that BAI passivation induces surface-healing effects, increasing surface and device stability. The I– components of BAI also replace imperfections at the perovskite interface, affording considerably reduced deep-level anomalies and mitigating nonradiative recombination. This theoretical perspective is supported experimentally via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy. BAI passivation and 2D-BA2PbI4 capping lowers work functions for 3D perovskite surfaces, registering at approximately 0.158 and 0.173 eV, respectively, which are lower than those of the control 3D film. Within the 2D/3D perovskite configuration, 2D-BA2PbI4 capping considerably increases the open-circuit voltage in solar cells. In comparison, devices with BAI-enhanced interfaces show improved durability with promise for solar cell applications.",

Studies of structure characterization and small-angle X-ray scattering reveal that, initially, CsPbBr3 SC clusters are assembled into ordered nano-SCs.

    "abstract": "Green hydrogen, generated through water electrolysis using renewable electricity, serves as an environmentally sustainable energy carrier. However, affordable transition metal catalysts require a significant overpotential to sustain the H2 production at a high current density (>500 mA cm–2) over an extended duration. In this study, we employ the high-temperature shock (HTS) method to fabricate densely assembled ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles and single atoms on porous carbon (DA-RuNP+SA/C), achieving a high metal loading of up to 85.5 wt %. Microscopic and spectroscopic results confirm the coexistence of nanoparticles and single atoms embedded in the porous carbon matrix. Short reaction time during HTS guarantees the controllable migration of Ru atoms over the carbon matrix, effectively suppressing the vicious aggregation into larger particles at high temperatures. High temperature reinforces the interaction between metal and substrate, benefiting the structural robustness and electron transfer at the interface. Both experimental and theoretical analyses of the reaction mechanism propose that Ru nanoparticles serve as catalytic sites, while single atoms modulate the electronic structure of Ru nanoparticles to regulate their water dissociation capability and optimize hydrogen adsorption energy. Consequently, the DA-RuNP+SA/C catalyst delivers an ultralow overpotential of 13 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and remarkable durability. It sustains continuous operation for 550 h at a current density of 1 A cm–2 in an alkaline solution, surpassing the stability of almost all previously reported Ru-based catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite materials can improve the average visible light transmittance (AVT) of themselves by adjusting the bandgap, which makes them popular for semitransparent photovoltaics (ST-PVs). However, the poor stability of traditional 3D perovskites limits their applications, so we introduce a quasi-two-dimensional perovskite process with better stability for our devices. In this paper, quasi-two-dimensional semitransparent perovskite solar cells (2D-ST-PSCs) with high AVT are prepared by introducing Br– ions to replace some I– ions in BA2MA4Pb5(I1–xBrx)16 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and combine the nonpreheating (NP) process for the thinner perovskite films. The quasi-two-dimensional perovskite film is created with the advantages of a highly oriented crystal structure, dense morphology, fewer defects, high crystallinity, and uniform particle size distribution when the ideal x value is 0.2. Therefore, the film of the NP process obtains a wide bandgap of 1.75 eV to get a 55.27% AVT.

Achieving a comprehensive understanding and precise control of these interactions is crucial in molecular design and the development of functional devices. Here, we utilize scanning tunneling microscopic break junction measurements and first-principles calculations to identify π–π and π–lone pair (π–lp) interactions within diphenyl disulfide derivatives at the single-molecule level. The competition between π–π and π–lp interactions regulates molecular conformation and conductance, leading to switching between high- and low-conductance states. Specifically, π–π interactions promote the high-conductance state, while π–lp interactions drive the molecule into a low-conductance state. Chemical modifications provide efficient methods to adjust π–π and π–lp interactions. These findings not only reveal the underlying mechanism of how π–π and π–lp interactions influence molecular conformation and induce the stereoelectronic effect but also offer a novel approach for creating practical devices.",

In this work, we systematically study a series of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A-D-A) type small-molecule donors by incorporating halogenation at the thienyl benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) donor core unit named BSTR-F, BSTR-Cl, and BSTR-Br. Such halogenation is demonstrated to induce a significant increase in the ionization potential, i.e., deeper HOMO, and more ordered packing property. Using N3 as the acceptor, the BSTR-F-based devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 15.93%, compared with the control nonhalogenated donor BSTR-H-based devices of 13.80%, indicating that the suitable halogenation strategy could effectively promote the high performance of ASM-OSCs.",

    "abstract": "Ricin, a potent protein synthesis inhibitor, shows significant potential as an anticancer agent. However, the limited delivery efficiency to tumor cells hampers its therapeutic efficacy. Here, we propose a novel approach for precise delivery of ricin A-chain (RTA) to tumors using aptamer-functionalized liposomes. RTA initially binds to Golgi-targeting carbon dots (CDs), followed by the encapsulation of CDs–RTA conjugates in aptamer-functionalized liposomes. Leveraging the precise recognition between nucleolin and aptamers and CDs' Golgi targeting, we achieve efficient transportation of RTA to tumor cells, thereby facilitating its potent chemotherapeutic effect. Furthermore, we enhanced the therapeutic efficacy by incorporating the photosensitizer pheophorbide a (PPa) into liposomes. Combined with near-infrared laser-mediated photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy, the liposomal system exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to monotherapy. This synergistic bimodal approach holds great promise for various biomedical applications, particularly in the field of cancer therapy.",

In this work, two novel chlorinated fused-ring electron acceptors were designed and synthesized through side-chain engineering, of which the rotation of end-capping groups on the indenedithiene [3,2-b] thiophene core was effectively restricted. Benefiting from the conformation lock, the IMC6–4Cl and IMC8–4Cl binary donor/acceptor (D/A) blend films realized more ordered molecular stacking and reduced Urbach energy, leading to lower ELoss of the devices. Moreover, the prolonged side chains in IMC8–4Cl inhibited excessive aggregation of the molecules and facilitated better miscibility with D18. Therefore, the D18:IMC8–4Cl blend films exhibited more rational D/A phase separation and reduced energy disorder. Eventually, the D18:IMC8–4Cl based devices achieved an exceptional power conversion efficiency of 13.99% and a decent VOC of 0.97 eV.",

X-ddi-2-Ni accommodates two C8 isomers per Ni unit, resulting in relatively high uptake (ca. 50 wt %), but with low selectivity toward C8 isomers as found using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC). In addition, a narrow range of gate-opening pressures for each isomer was determined from dynamic vapor sorption, consistent with the nonadaptable nature of the C8-loaded phase determined crystallographically, also supported by modeling.",

Herein, Co single atoms with surface coordination or lattice coordination mode in Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers are presented for CO2 photoreduction. A novel strategy based on metal-based ionic liquids is developed to prepare stable surface single atom tuned catalysts. In contrast to high-coordinated lattice-doped Co single atoms, the low-coordinated Co single atoms loaded on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in decreasing the activation energy and rate-limiting step energy barriers. The surface-modified Co single atoms work as a polarization center to drive photogenerated electron migration, accelerate reaction kinetics, and enhance CO2 reduction activity. Benefiting from these features, Cosur-Bi24O31Br10 exhibits a more enhanced CO2 photoreduction performance than Bi24O31Br10 and Colat-Bi24O31Br10. This work provides insight into the effect of positions of single atoms on photocatalytic behavior and offers a strategy to load other low-coordinated surface metal single atoms.",

In this review, we focus on the physical properties of earth-abundant metal oxides and the choice of device architecture as key considerations for constructing a PEC device for practical hydrogen production. We introduce previous studies on BiVO4 to elaborate on various methods for facilitating the transport of charge carriers through metal oxides and their interface with an electrolyte.

Based on this discussion, we highlight a wireless monolithic tandem PEC device made up of earth-abundant elements and expatiate on practical aspects regarding the preparation and operation of such PEC devices.",

The π-conjugation enables stronger coordination between the additives and the perovskite top interface. This effectively passivates defects from uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, Cs+ ions, and Br– vacancies. Additionally, strain relaxation is enabled by the dual-anchoring geometry of the molecules. Together, defect passivation and strain relaxation enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Finally, we achieved champion efficiencies of 11.02% for a CsPbBr3 PSC, 14.67% for a CsPbI2Br PSC, and 23.66% for a FA0.97Cs0.03PbI3 PSC. Long-term stability tests revealed improved humidity and heat stability, confirming the benefits of addressing both interface defects and residual strain.",

Herein, we established isolated transition metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) on N-doped carbon (M–N–C) and employed them in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Significantly, Ni–N–C exhibits the highest selectivity (∼97.9%) toward CO at −0.8 V vs RHE. In situ XAS characterization discloses the coordination number dependent catalytic performance. The decreased average coordination number of Ni in Ni–N–C at the voltage point with maximum Faradaic efficiency was observed. Density functional theory further provides the possible mechanism of CO2-to-CO over the undercoordinated Ni–N–C structure.",

For AWS to operate at high current densities (hundreds of mA/cm2), the device architecture must ensure a large catalytic surface area, rapid ion diffusion, and minimal solution and charge transfer resistances. Effective electrodes should also facilitate gas bubble detachment and release. 3D-printed electrodes have shown promise, but stacking them increases the ion diffusion length and solution resistance. We demonstrate a new device architecture with interpenetrating gyroid electrodes, providing a large ion-accessible surface area and gas diffusion channels. This design significantly reduces the interelectrode distance, lowering ion diffusion length and solution resistance. Simulations show faster ion diffusion and higher current density in the interpenetrating configuration compared with separate electrodes. This improved performance, especially at low temperatures and high current densities, highlights a promising strategy for enhancing AWS and other electrochemical systems limited by slow ion diffusion.",

To address this matter, a new methylated MOF (TUTQ-1Ni) featuring multiple N/O active sites was successfully constructed. TUTQ-1Ni exhibited a record high C2H2/CO2 uptake ratio of 4.1 and top tier C2H2/CO2 selectivity (11.4) among the reported hydrophobic adsorbents. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies combined with theoretical calculations indicated that multiple N/O sites provided strong and multiple attractive interactions for C2H2 over CO2. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated that TUTQ-1Ni efficiently separated C2H2/CO2 mixtures, affording a high separation factor of 7.4. Benefiting from the high density of methyl groups, the C2H2/CO2 separation performance of TUTQ-1Ni was even maintained at a high relative humidity of 85%.",

First, high-content hydroxyl groups in a carbonaceous framework stem from preservation after low-temperature pyrolysis and introduction after KOH treatment. Second, molten KOH removes some carbon atoms in carbonaceous resin to form micropores and unstable domains to form macropores. Third, molten KOH promotes removal of some sp3-carbon atoms and/or their conversion to sp2-carbon atoms, forming a large-size conjugated plane to ensure electrical conductivity. Obvious reversible redox conversion between catechol and quinone groups during charge/discharge according to ex-situ O 1s XPS and GCD/CV analyses reliably confirms accessible catechol configurations in macro/microporous carbon as pseudocapacitive sites.

    "abstract": "Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have reached a certified efficiency of 26.1% due to the excellent photoelectric properties of perovskite thin films, showing significant commercialization prospects. Preparing high-performance PSCs with uniform, large-area perovskite thin films remains challenging. Magnetron sputtering is a common method of film preparation in industry, which has the advantage of easy control over film crystallization, high repeatability, and low cost. And recently, it also exhibits promise in perovskite thin film preparation. This review first introduces the principle and the advantages of magnetron sputtering of perovskite thin films, where the role of plasma is highlighted. Then, the effects of plasma on perovskite film quality are systematically discussed, including the elemental ratio, crystallinity, and defect density. Subsequently, we review the recent advances in magnetron sputtering of perovskite thin films for photovoltaic applications. Finally, possible directions for fabricating high-quality perovskite thin films and high-performance PSCs via magnetron sputtering are discussed, including sputtering process optimization, target composition adjustment, and post-treatment processes. With these strategies, the development of magnetron sputtered PSCs toward commercialization may be achieved soon.",

The impact of strain stress on each layer of the FTJ is investigated depending on the thickness of the metal capping layer and the post-metal-annealing temperature. It is revealed that, for the insulator layer, an increase in strain lead to an increased off-current in the FTJs. In contrast, increased strain stress in the ferroelectric layer directly increases the trap density, leading to an increase in the on-current of the FTJs. Furthermore, we analyze how these strain-induced changes affect the performance and reliability of FTJs in neuromorphic systems. We propose optimization strategies for strain stress in FTJs based on the frequency of neural network updates, highlighting the critical balance between achieving a large dynamic range and ensuring device endurance, aligning device performance with the specific demands and conditions of neural network applications.",

This study explores metallic nickel boride (NiB) as a catalyst to enhance charge transfer and LiPS conversion. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that NiB accelerates sulfur redox kinetics, significantly improving the battery performance. With a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm–2 cycled at 0.5 C, the NiB-based battery achieved a discharge capacity of 1239 mAh g–1, retaining 83.2% after 150 cycles. Even at a current density of 14.89 mA cm–2, it maintained a capacity of 590 mAh g–1 with a low decay rate of 0.07%.

Local proton concentration changes during the oxygen evolution reaction were monitored in the nonzero gap electrolyzer and MEA systems. The measurements constitute a methodology to evaluate the ion transport efficiency of the MEA. The strategy was extended to investigate the effect of an activation process, buffering of the electrolyte, and poisoning effect on the change in proton transport efficiency. This novel strategy enables the estimation of the actual pH of the MEA system during operation and is of great relevance in understanding the process conditions during sustainable fuel production.",

Its homopolymer shows an ionic conductivity that is ∼5 orders of magnitude higher (9.2 × 10–8 S cm–1 at 25 °C), in comparison with previously reported analogues, while the conductivity of its random copolymer with poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ethermethacrylate reaches the levels of 10–6 and 10–5 S cm–1 at 25 and 70 °C, respectively.

    "abstract": "Surface ligand coordination chemistry is vital for the growth and stability of nanocrystals, particularly perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs). Yet, the inherent proton exchange between conventional capping molecules introduces an unstable surface, consistently leading to diminished performance. Here, a sole chelating ligand capping method is proposed for synthesizing anisotropic CsPbBr3 NPLs, which serve as the model system due to their significant appeal for blue light-emitting applications. A chelating ligand (CTE) is designed via a straightforward solution-based amidation reaction between oleylamine and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; acting as the sole surfactant, CTE strongly coordinates with the Pb2+ precursor, directly facilitating the formation of (PbBr6)4– octahedrons and circumventing the protonation/deprotonation process. This strategy allows further post-treatment with 4-phenylbutylammonium bromide while maintaining NPLs' emission characteristics and anisotropic morphology. As a result, pure blue-emitting CsPbBr3 NPLs with a PLQY of 97% can be achieved, and their photophysical and structural characteristics remain stable over 30 days under ambient conditions.",

We use the PM6/Y6 derivatives as model systems and incorporate fullerenes such as PC71BM into the acceptor layer to enhance aggregation, improve crystallinity, increase electron mobility, and reduce trap density. Consequently, bilayer devices based on PM6/BTP-eC9 and PM6/L8-BO achieved efficiencies of 18.0% and 19.5%, respectively, approaching the performance of bulk heterojunction cells.

Herein, five isoreticular COFs with sql underlying nets have been successfully synthesized using benzothiadiazole-based ditopic aldehydes with varied linker lengths and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)pyrene as organic building units. The five obtained COFs exhibit significantly different activities toward photocatalytic aerobic oxidation. Remarkably, the COF-containing vinyl group, HIAM-0020, exhibited the best photocatalytic performance with near-unity conversion and selectivity for photocatalytic oxidative benzylamine coupling within 2 h. The experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that HIAM-0020 exhibits faster charge separation ability and lower charge migration resistance compared with the other four COFs. This work represents promising guidance for the rational design and synthesis of COF-based photocatalysts to achieve efficient organic transformation.",

More importantly, a series of morphologies of MoN, including pyramidal crystals, were obtained by adjusting the synthesis time and the amount of hydrogen in nitrogen gas from 15% to 5%. The mechanism of this morphology evolution is explained through the molecular diffusion kinetic growth process. Furthermore, the MoN films present enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction due to the exposed catalytically active surface and fast electron transport in highly conductive hexagonal MoN (h-MoN).",

A hallmark of CLL is preferential cleavage of Au–Au bonds, as opposed to bonds connecting the molecular layer to the substrate, i.e., Au–S bonds. Herein, we show that CLL can be used more broadly as a technique to pattern a variety of substrates composed of coinage metals (Pt, Pd, Ag, Cu), transition and reactive metals (Ni, Ti, Al), and a semiconductor (Ge) using straightforward alkanethiolate self-assembly chemistry. We demonstrate high-fidelity patterning in terms of precise features over large areas on all surfaces investigated. We use patterned monolayers as chemical resists for wet etching to generate metal microstructures. Substrate atoms, along with alkanethiolates, were removed as a result of lift-off, as previously observed for Au. We demonstrate the formation of PDMS-stamp-supported bimetallic monolayers by performing CLL on two different metal surfaces using the same PDMS stamp. By expanding the scope of the surfaces compatible with CLL, we advance and generalize CLL as a method to pattern a wide range of substrates, as well as to produce supported metal monolayers, both with broad applications in surface and materials science.",

    "abstract": "Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) have exceptional gas separation performance for a broad range of applications. However, PIMs are highly susceptible to physical aging, which drastically reduces their long-term performance over time. In this work, we leverage complementary experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies to decipher the inter-/intrachain changes that occur during aging of the prototypical PIM-1 and its rigidified analogue PIM-C1. By elucidating this hereto unexplored aging behavior, we reveal that the dramatic decrease in gas permeability of PIM materials during aging stems from a loss of fractional free volume (FFV) due to PIM chain relaxations induced by π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, or van der Waals' forces. While the PIM-1 based membranes displayed enhanced gas pair selectivities after aging, the PIM-C1 based membranes showed an opposite trend with unexpected reductions for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4. This is due to the reductions in CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 solubility (S) selectivities and, unlike PIM-1, the spirobisindane locked PIM-C1 (i.e., maintenance of micropore sizes) has a stable diffusivity (D) selectivities that cannot offset such reductions. These fundamental insights into the intrinsic relaxation of different PIM polymer chains during physical aging can guide the future design of high-performance PIM materials with enhanced anti-aging properties.",

Moreover, it also shows pronounced mechanical performance that can be compressed over 70% and recover without fracture.

Two kinds of coordination effects were discussed here: intrinsic coordination and dynamic coordination.

The charge capacity of the active site and solvation effect also play an important role in the adsorption of reactants and intermediates on single-atom catalysts.",

Rational design of an artificial electrode/electrolyte interface is regarded as an effective way to circumvent the above problems. Herein, a phosphating–nitriding method is developed through the reaction between lithium metal and a PCl5–LiNO3 complex. An as-formed hybrid interface, consisting of Li3N, Li3PO4, and nanocrystalline LiCl, offers high ionic conductivity and strong mechanical stability for uniform lithium electrodeposition. The dendrite-free behavior is further investigated through ex situ and in situ techniques. Accordingly, the modified 50 μm Li anode exhibits a high-current-density durability of 10 mA cm–2 and a long-term cycling performance of greater than 300 h at a high Li-metal utilization of 30.6% under a conventional EC/DEC electrolyte. A full cell paired with a high-voltage cathode LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) displays a 4-fold improvement in cell lifetime under a low negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) of 3.92.

Our systematic electron diffraction analyses and simulations demonstrate unequivocally that the same twinning structure is present in both phases, notably with a perfectly coherent {111} twin boundary in the cubic phase and a semi-coherent {011} twin boundary in the tetragonal phase. The atomic configuration of the twin boundary is discussed with possibilities of being AX3 centered (with A = Cs, FA, MA and X = I, Br) or B-site centered (Pb) for both crystal structures. We propose that the twin boundary is a key nucleation region for phase segregation, which acts as a potential well or barrier to electrons and holes depending on its composition and hence bandgap.",

SCFs possess several unique properties rendering them excellently adapted for the reaction medium of MOF membranes (like ZIF-8) which, although offering an energy-efficient and eco-friendly option for large-scale industrial separation, are still experiencing a dilemma between process sustainability and performance superiority. In this study we addressed this issue through a facile SCF synthetic protocol employing supercritical CO2 (scCO2) as the reaction medium. Relying on the near-zero surface tension, low viscosity, and high diffusivity of scCO2, nanoscale intercrystalline defects could be effectively patched, resulting in the formation of well-intergrown ZIF-8 membranes with commercially attractive olefin/paraffin (C3H6/C3H8) separation performance. Moreover, after the SCF processing, both discharged CO2 and unreacted ligands could be conveniently recovered and reutilized, resulting in zero pollutant discharge due to the controllable phase transition, variable solubility, and chemical inertness of scCO2. This work sheds lights on the promising prospects of SCF processing for sustainable fabrication of high-performing MOF membranes.",

However, taking the photoanode as an example, the onset potential (Vonset) of the photoanodic current is too positive, which is not conducive to the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and thus hinders the practical application of PEC hydrogen production. Here, we demonstrate a new quaternary alloy nanowire photoanode with low Vonset and high solar conversion efficiency constructed by a narrow-bandgap semiconductor CdSeTe and a wide-bandgap semiconductor CdS, a strategy that enables the energy band modulation by adjusting the molar ratio of the two semiconductors. Through the modulation of the band structure, the negative shift in the Vonset of the PEC hydrogen production can be realized, so that high photocurrent is achieved under a lower bias voltage. As a result, we cathodically shifted the Vonset by 0.7 VRHE on the alloyed cadmium-based chalcogenide photoanode under 1-sun light. This strategy of using energy band modulation to achieve a lower Vonset and high energy conversion efficiency will provide more possibilities for the industrial application of PEC hydrogen production.",

This treatment effectively separates small analytical targets (e.g., glucose, catalase, and bacteriophage) and large undesired components (e.g., bacteria and blood cells) in the biofluids by capturing the former inside and excluding the latter outside the PSAP beads. We have successfully demonstrated that this treatment can reduce sample volume, self-aliquot the liquid sample, avoid microbial contamination, separate plasma from blood cells, stabilize target species inside the beads, and enable long-term storage at room temperature.

    "abstract": "The effects of I2 oxidation on the behavior of Cu2xS nanoparticles—their long-term localized-surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), crystal structure, composition, and ability to undergo cation exchange—were explored. I2 has been known to induce a blue shift in the LSPR of Cu2xS nanoparticles due to the increase in the hole concentration through the removal of Cu+ ions. An unexpected red shift is observed in I2-exposed Cu2–xS nanoparticles over the longer times required for cation exchange. Despite this complication of the LSPR behavior, the process of cation exchange from Cu+ to Cd2+ is modulated by the exposure of the Cu2xS nanoparticle precursor to elemental iodide, I2. This is consistent with the promotion of cation exchange through increased vacancy concentration. Treatment with I2 induces a greater extent of cation exchange than in controls. Increasing I2 exposure results in a greater extent of exchange and exchange at lower temperatures. The increased mobility of sulfide ions to which the red shift in LSPR is attributed also affects the resultant CdS crystal structure. Zinc-blende CdS, which has an altered anion network, is observed upon increased I2 exposure or extended cation-exchange reaction times. This work offers insights into the mechanism of cation exchange and the modulation of the LSPR of plasmonic semiconductors.",

This provides us with the opportunity to re-examine the origin of dual emission in such COFs in the context of an antiparallel stacked structure, in lieu of an earlier proposal based on incorrectly assigned eclipsed stacked structure. We discover that the intralayer and interlayer hydrogen bonding in the antiparallel stacked structure work synergistically to restrict intermolecular bond rotation, thus turning on fluorescence. The interlayer hydrogen bonding between the acyl oxygen and the side-chain hydrogen is stronger in the dual emissive COF, compared to those in the single emissive ones, underscoring the roles of competing interhydrogen and intrahydrogen bonds in the excited-state conformers.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that more than 27% of existing materials are topological and exhibit intrinsically high electrical conductivity with high stability protected by topology, which can meet the requirement that the battery cathode needs to be conductive not just ionically but also electronically for the high rate performance. In this work, using machine learning and first-principle calculations, for the first time we have screened 7386 topological quantum materials with low diffusion energy barriers. Especially, topological semimetal Na4CoO3 has been identified to exhibit high reversible capacity of 269.5 mAh/g and high energy density of 746.5 Wh/kg. Furthermore, Na4CoO3 also exhibits good compatibility with many sodium metal oxides solid electrolyte such as Na3PO4 and NaAlO2. These findings suggest that Na4CoO3 can be a novel high performance Na-ion battery cathode material going beyond the conventional ones.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) is among the remarkable phenomena induced by disorder in quantum phase transitions (QPTs). In recent years, experimental progresses have been made in ultrathin superconducting films. However, there is still lack of approaches to trigger QGS in bulk superconductors. Herein, we develop a charge-induced disorder introduction process to trigger QGS in organic-inorganic hybrid superlattices. Large-sized organic cations are intercalated into layered inorganic crystal, which leads to electron doping and thus quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity. The charge transfer between inorganic layers and interlayer cations introduces charge disorder into the hybrid superlattice without destroying lattice integrality. Consequently, QGS emerges in the bulk superconducting superlattice. Furthermore, deviation of phase boundary from the Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg theory indicates relatively strong spin-orbit coupling. The observation provides a new pathway to investigate QPTs in disordered systems and reveals universality of QGS in superconductors.",

    "abstract": "Materials defects are very important for enhancing the catalytic functions and applications. However, the surface defects of materials are usually diverse, and their catalytic activity is generally measured at the averaging level. How to directly measure/observe the catalytic activity of the single defective site is extremely important for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts; however, it remains a grand challenge. Herein, we directly observe the reactivity and simultaneously surface reconstructions of the single defective site by \"storing\" catalytic trajectories and collectively presenting reactivity profiles on solid surfaces via in situ transmission electron microscopy using a thermally catalyzed graphitic layer growth model reaction on terminations of grain boundaries (GBs) of platinum. The direct in situ observation results for single defective sites reveal that the surface reactivity decreases in the order of concave terminations of high-angle GBs > concave terminations of low-angle GBs > roughened edge boundaries > flat surfaces. In particular, we find that the heterogeneous reconstructions appear the surface-smoothening on high-angle GBs, while the surface-roughening on low-angle GBs and edge boundaries, which is rationalized by two competitive processes: the release of excessive strain energy and the adsorption-induced step formation. Comprehensively, the concave terminations of low-angle GBs and the roughened edge boundaries represent promising catalytic surface defects with a fine balance between reactivity and stability. The DFT calculations result reveals a novel rhombohedral Volcano-type Zebra-crossing plot for the structure–activity relation regarding the improved reactivity by strained defect sites, different from a conventional Volcano-type plot in catalysis studies. We expect the current in situ method, direct observation of catalytic roles of surface defects, and their in situ restructuring would assist the design and synthesis of more nanocatalysts in the future.",

    "abstract": "Development of Mg-ion batteries as advanced electrochemical energy storage systems relies on the design and discovery of high-voltage positive electrode (cathode) materials. To date, a variety of sulfide cathodes have been reported (e.g., MgxMo6S8, MgxTi2S4, etc.), but the voltages of these materials are too low to prepare a high energy density Mg cell. Theoretical computations predicted that MgxCr2S4 operating with the high-voltage Cr3+/4+ redox couple would serve as a suitable cathode candidate, but experimental attempts to extract Mg2+ from the lattice have been largely unsuccessful. We show that reversible electrochemical activity within a thiospinel framework (AB2S4) relies on a redox-active transition metal present in the B site; otherwise, anionic redox activity triggers decomposition of the spinel structure. Since Cr and S states are highly coupled in MgCr2S4, the Cr3+/4+ redox couple is inaccessible so that reversible (de)intercalation of Mg2+ cannot occur and charging leads to dissolution of the active material. These findings point to an insufficiency in the screening criteria previously used to identify MgCr2S4 as a promising Mg cathode. Thus, a computable descriptor based on the electronic structure of the discharged material is proposed to predict the prevalence of cation vs anion redox and improve future surveys of potential candidates. It is unlikely that the high-voltage Cr redox couple will be accessible to oxidation in the presence of sulfur within the restrictions of a spinel framework; however, it is possible that a suitable layered MgxCrS2 structure could serve as a reversible high-voltage Mg cathode.",

    "abstract": "Intermolecular interactions have fundamental importance in the control of active layer morphology, exciton generation, charge transport, and, thus, the overall photovoltaic performance. This is especially true for quasiplanar heterojunction (Q-PHJ) polymer solar cells, because the bilayer device structure requires larger exciton diffusion lengths. However, little effort has been made to design polymer donors with additional organic functional groups intended to control intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. Herein, we report two new copolymers for Q-PHJ solar cells synthesized by the addition of hydroxy (PNTB-OH) and acetoxy groups (PNTB-OAc) onto electron-deficient units. We have systematically investigated the influence of the hydrogen bond on electro-optical behaviors, crystallinity, photovoltaic properties, energy losses, photostability, and storage stability in both types of polymers. The single-crystal data reveals more regular stacking and order orientation driven by hydrogen bonding, of the acetoxy-substituted electron-deficient units. Q-PHJ organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated for both polymers with a high-performance nonfullerene acceptor N3. PNTB-OAc-based Q-PHJ OSCs realized the highest photovoltaic performance of 16.53%, which is ∼2.4 times higher than 6.79% obtained from the PNTB-OH-based Q-PHJ OSCs. This high performance is attributable to low nonradiative energy losses, high and balanced electron/hole mobility, and better crystallinity. In contrast, the PNTB-OAc film has a longer crystal coherence length, which is calculated from grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Furthermore, the PNTB-OAc device demonstrated superior photostability and storage stability, retained more than 85% of the initial PCE after illumination for 1050 h, and 90% of the initial PCE under nitrogen for 1600 h. This work highlights the importance of the acetoxy group to significantly control packing and crystallinity by hydrogen bonding, thus realizing efficient OSCs with durable device stability.",

Herein, a CdS/TiO2 bilayer is coated on a CdTe absorber via chemical bath deposition and magnetron sputtering, successively, to build directional interfacial charge transfer channels for efficient photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution. The obtained multilayered CdTe/CdS/TiO2/Pt photocathode yields a dramatically increased photocurrent density of −9.6 mA cm–2 at −0.4 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm–2). It is well evidenced that, with the CdS/TiO2 bilayer coated onto CdTe, the CdTe/CdS/TiO2 heterojunction, with a well aligned band structure, generates favorable conduction band offset, energetically facilitating electron transfer from CdTe to CdS, and then to TiO2. Moreover, the CdTe/CdS/TiO2/Pt photocathode shows good stability for water reduction due to the TiO2 protective layer stabilizing against the photocorrosion of CdTe/CdS. This study provides referable guidance for designing multilayer photoelectrodes for stable and efficient solar water splitting from the viewpoint of interface energetics engineering.",

However, their inevitably complicated structures not only bring tedious and time-consuming synthesis, but also lead to inherent difficult in crystallization which hinder the understanding of structure-emission relationship. Polymorphism represents an ingenious strategy for revealing unambiguous structure-emission relationships. Therefore, designing simple molecules to construct DR and NIR polymorphic emission is challenging yet highly desirable. Herein, multiple DR and NIR emission ranges from 624 to 742 nm is achieved in polymorphisms of an extremely simple π-conjugated luminogen. Multiple packing modes are simultaneously integrated into this compound. Its unique packing-dependent emission facilitates the establishment of clear packing-emission relationship. Increased intermolecular exciton coupling between adjacent molecules leads to gradually red-shifted emission from orange to DR and finally to NIR. The aggregation-induced emission feature of the molecule renders the bulk crystals with visible crystal-to-crystal polymorphic transformation under external stimuli. This work not only breaks the limitations of the research of organic polymorphism materials with NIR emission, but also provides a reliable strategy to reveal the influence of molecular packing on NIR emission.",

Herein, we develop a series of corrugated layered titanates that extend the K+–K+ distance to ∼3.9 Å, exceeding the K+–K+ distance of all reported layered oxides. By shielding the K+–K+ electrostatic repulsion, K0.8Mn0.8Ti1.2O4 and K0.8Ni0.4Ti1.6O4 as corrugated layered titanate representatives furnish high working voltages of 3.0 and 3.6 V, respectively.

    "abstract": "The emergence of high sulfur content polymeric materials and their applications in a number of important areas call for a comprehensive understanding of the chemical and physical properties of elemental sulfur. In spite of many earlier efforts, a thorough description of the electronic structure and photorelaxation pathways of the S8 ring, the thermodynamically stable structure of elemental sulfur, remains largely unexplored. It can be expected that the photoinduced homolytic processes of S8 and intermediates are analogous to those in the species observed via thermally induced processes. Here, we combine time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and highly correlated wave function STEOM-CCSD calculations to describe the photoinduced homolytic pathways in both singlet and triplet excited-state manifolds and explore the ring-to-chain relaxations. The results of our calculations indicate that, upon photoexcitation, the S8 ring undergoes a fast intersystem crossing (ISC) from the S1 state to the triplet manifold, with estimated ISC rates of over 1011 s–1 as a result of significant spin–orbit couplings. The TD-DFT geometry relaxations in the singlet and triplet excited states underline that, upon photoexcitation, an S–S bond within the S8 ring readily undergoes homolytic fragmentation, a feature that is thus also expected upon thermal excitation. Importantly, this represents the first theoretical demonstration that the molecular structure in the triplet state evolves from a ring configuration to an open chain configuration that carries a diradical character, which is consistent with the reported photoinduced polymerization processes in elemental sulfur.",

However, the influence of an enhanced electric field on the charge-transfer process of MOFs has not been quantitatively explored, leading to an elusive understanding of the synergetic effect of metal@MOF core–shell substrates. Here we reveal a synergetic effect through SERS measurements of gold nanobipyramid (Au NBP) @zeolitic-imidazolate-framework (ZIF) core–shell nanostructures with varied thickness and composition of the shell. The synergetic effect was confirmed by the stronger enhancement factors of some NBP@ZIFs than that of pure NBP-785 with methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine 6G as the probe. Moreover, a reorientation phenomenon of MO discovered in the ZIF shell probably also accounted for the higher intensity, given that the probe orientation could impact the SERS intensity. Besides elucidating the charge transfer and synergy effect of the metal@MOF core–shell SERS substrates, this work could also provide new ideas to enrich the family of the shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates by employing porous materials as the shell.",

However, the unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and related hazardous dendrite growth plague the stability and further development of the Li-metal anode, which would be exacerbated by an O2 atmosphere in LOBs. Herein, the dithiobiuret (DTB, C2H5N3S2) additive was introduced into a typical ether electrolyte to regulate the Li+ solvated sheath configuration, and the solvation sheath was tailored and evolved to a solvent-depleted state. Consequently, an anion-derived SEI film architecture with F-rich and O-deficient components was formed. Systematically, studies of spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis demonstrated that such specific SEI architecture can trigger grain refinement and promote dendrite-free morphology. Benefiting from the addition of DTB and under an O2 atmosphere, the electrochemical performance of both Li/Li symmetrical cells and Li–O2 cells has been significantly enhanced.",

The separation mechanisms of different gases over these membranes have been discussed previously. These mechanisms mainly include two contributions: thermodynamic and kinetic. Depending on the type of framework and gas, each contribution can be dominant. The question is which are the pressing issues that the scientific community needs to focus on to take these membranes to the next step. Herein, I discuss some important aspects that require attention to these membranes for their potential deployment. These aspects include mainly membrane reproducibility, scalability, performance under realistic conditions, and overall techno-economic analysis.",

In this study, we focus on the synthesis and electrochemical investigation of metal hydroxide salt monolayer nanoparticles modified with different molecules toward improved electrochemical functions. Nickel hydroxide carboxylate nanoparticles were successfully prepared through the epoxide-mediated alkalinization method using alkylcarboxylates. It was found that the monolayer nanoparticles with a size of approximately 2 nm were formed directly from an ionic precursor or after ultrasonication post-treatment. Manganese, iron, and cobalt hydroxide carbonates were found to form monolayer nanoparticles through the same procedure. Synthesized nickel hydroxide carbonate monolayer nanoparticles with a short alkylcarboxylate showed enhanced redox processes and electrochemical functions due to higher proton diffusion coefficient, lower electron transfer resistance, and improved intrinsic catalytic activity. We propose that the results obtained in this study will provide a novel design strategy for metal hydroxide monolayer nanoparticulate catalysts toward high functionality.",

Herein, by using hematite as the prototype electrode, its performance dependence on temperature is well resolved, and the efficiency loss/gain of each elemental step during PEC water splitting is also quantitatively analyzed. The deteriorated temperature coefficient of open-circuit voltage on hematite for water oxidation (from −6.50 mV K–1 to −3.50 mV K–1) than sulfite oxidation (from −3.52 mV K–1 to −2.60 mV K–1) reveals that slow water oxidation kinetics retards photovoltage generation.

In this research, molecular imprinting is further achieved in a highly crystalline inorganic matrix (WO3·H2O) for the first time without the need of introducing additional functional groups. Target molecules, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) have been molecularly imprinted with much stronger binding affinities to the orthorhombic WO3·H2O matrix compared to common covalent bindings such as C–C, C–H, and N–H. Also, target molecules have strong multiple interactions in the crystalline matrix so as to firmly interact with the matrix for embedding partially/completely. The effective removal of targets at an optimal temperature of 400 °C can ensure the integrity of imprinted sites of WO3·H2O nanoplates, which is important for acquiring excellent performance in ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical sensing compared to those treated at lower or higher temperatures. More targets of interest were molecularly imprinted and tested to demonstrate their excellent sensitivity/selectivity. This general photoelectrochemical platform simplifies the preparation of molecularly imprinted systems and lays the foundation for imprinting organics in visible light-responsive inorganic matrices, which is more feasible for further deviceization and miniaturization in various sensing applications such as environmental monitoring/treatment.",

Here, we present a scalable fabrication approach for an intrinsically stretchable Zn-MnO2 microbattery featuring excellent electrochemical performance and ultrahigh stretchability of up to 200%. As a key design concept, the interdigitated current collector harnesses heterogeneous stiffness to create spatially nonuniform strain distributions for selective reduction of actual strains on individual electrodes. The corresponding microbattery consequently achieves reliable operations under both static and dynamic tensile deformation modes. A self-powering system composed of an LED array powered by a microbattery pack achieves conformable attachment onto the moving body, which demonstrates the practical suitability of the microbattery for skin-attachable wearable electronics.",

The ultrathin ZGO nanoribbons [abbreviated as ZGO(100)] exhibit efficient and dominantly selective CO2 photoreduction performance into CO with the evolution yield of up to 20.81 μmol g–1 h–1 in the presence of water vapor, in much contrast to only CH4 production of 0.67 μmol g–1 h–1 for (010), exposing the thick ZGO nanobelts reported previously. The atomically thin structure of ZGO(100) shortens the migration distance of charge carriers onto the surface from the interior and allows more electrons to survive and accumulate on the surface, thus benefiting the activation and reduction of CO2. The density function theory calculation reveals that the formed CO* is inclined to escape from the exclusively exposed {100} facet of the ultrathin ZGO nanoribbon rather than be further protonated to derive CHO*, a vital intermediate for CH4 formation, leading ZGO(100) to be an ideal platform for catalytically selective CO production. This work would not only enrich atomically thin catalyst materials but also render a new platform for the development of ternary semiconductors with outstanding performance in CO2 photoconversion.",

The nitrogen dopants are homogeneously distributed in the layered perovskite framework, resulting in an extended band-to-band visible light absorption edge up to 600 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.07 eV. It is worth noting that the nitrogen doping process has trivial impact on the crystal structure, microstructure, and chemical states of the BaLa4Ti4O15, which minimizes the side effect of photogenerated carrier separation and surface chemical reaction.

Specifically, two design criteria involve (1) The twisted cyanostilbene units not only endow the systems with solid-state fluorescence but also tailor the π–π interactions in the complex to generate the desired emission and (2) the large cavity of cyclophane results in the formation of ternary complexes with controllable binding affinity which further assemble into robust channels for the guests' exchange in the bulky state. This strategy unifies the advantages of both macrocycle and framework in one system, achieving visualization, recyclability, and easy processability simultaneously.

The proposed device can detect the targeted nucleobases with good transmission sensitivity. The random forest regression (RFR) model can predict the transmission function of each unknown nucleobase with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values as low as 0.16. Interestingly, if the machine is trained with the dataset of methylated DNA nucleobases, it can selectively identify all four DNA nucleobases with good accuracy.

    "abstract": "The intermediate phase adduct plays a crucial role in constructing uniform and compact tin perovskite films, thus providing an important approach for developing high-performance lead-free perovskite solar cells. However, the common intermediate phase adduct of SnI2·3DMSO in tin perovskite leads to phase separation and may lack compatibility with mixed cation tin perovskites composed of formamidinium (FA) and methylamine (MA), impeding the further device stability. Here, a facile and reproducible method is developed to fabricate high-quality FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 films by introducing a new stable intermediate phase adduct (SnI2·DMSO·MAFa) by using ionic liquid methylamine formate (MAFa). The resulting stable adduct suppresses the reaction rate between ammonium salts and SnI2, thereby modulating the tin perovskite crystallization and precluding SnI2 clusters formation, and the presence of the SnI2·DMSO·MAFa adduct in perovskite precursor serves as a protective barrier for Sn2+ ions, guarding them against oxidation caused by the presence of DMSO. Moreover, the amino and carbonyl groups in residual MAFa could repair the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Sn2+ ion defects. These features result in the formation of highly uniform and pinhole-free FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 films. The optimized devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%, a value of 53% higher than that of the control device (6.6%). Besides, the obtained MAFa-derived devices illustrate significantly enhanced stability in a microaerobic atmosphere, with 78% maintained initial efficiency over 2800 h of storage under N2 containing 50–100 ppm of O2.",

Larger enhancement could be achieved when TPE moieties are installed in the polymer backbones, in comparison to those installed in the side chains. Furthermore, their photoluminescence intensity could be significantly enhanced in an underwater environment, exhibiting great potential in underwater applications for luminescent sensing and/or light-emitting.",

Accentuating it, we have unveiled the potential therapeutic role of a cobalt nanoparticle (Co NP), the definitive function of which has remained cryptic for decades. We have found that it interacts with two biological entities, i.e., oxygen and amino acids, and thus curtails their reservoir. We have also identified them as the prerequisites for Co NP degradation. The reaction instigates hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) activation and engenders nutrient deprivation, respectively. The lactic acid thus generated as a consequence of metabolic modulation allowed us to meticulously design a novel combinatorial targeted therapy. This integrates the dual target starvation harnessed by the multifaceted and biomimetic Co NPs with the drug syrosingopine that begets intracellular acidification. The designed therapy further entailed metabolic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress which led to the discovery of whole-cell autophagy-mediated cell death. The underlying key molecular events propelled the whole cellular degradation, producing its death within the LC3-positive double-membrane vesicles. This is unlike the conventional macroautophagy that works by rendering cellular homeostasis and demands LC3 removal upon framing single-membrane autophagolysosomal vesicles.",

Rigid ladder-type conjugated polymers consisting of double-stranded fused-ring structure exhibit excellent thermal and electrochemical stabilities and thus are promising materials for organic thermoelectrics. However, effective synthesis, characterization, and solution processing are challenging and thus limit its application in thin-film devices. Here, two p-type pyrrolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]bis[1,4]benzothiazine ladder-type conjugated polymers with different pendant groups (methyl: PBBTL-CH3 and phenyl: PBBTL-Ph) were synthesized, and both can be solution-processed for thin-film thermoelectric applications. PBBTL-CH3 achieved electrical conductivities as high as 36.29 ± 0.58 S cm–1 and power factors up to 22.7 ± 2.1 μW m–1 K–2 when doped with FeCl3, which are significantly higher than of PBBTL-Ph with a conductivity of 1.40 ± 0.16 S cm–1 and a power factor of 1.7 ± 0.2 μW m–1 K–2. Grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering of the polymers showed PBBTL-CH3 exhibited exclusive edge-on orientation, while PBBTL-Ph exhibited mixed edge-on and face-on orientation. The present study indicates that pendant groups have important influence on the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance for the PBBTL series through alteration of HOMO energy levels, polymer packing, and ease of dopant infiltration.",

    "abstract": "Targeted delivery of coencapsulated drugs can increase therapeutic indices of cancers including improved tumor inhibition and safety profile. However, most cancers lack tumor specific receptors (antigens) to guide the targeted delivery. Tumoral P-selectin can be rapidly upregulated after ionization radiation, indicating it is a highly selective target for drug delivery. In this work, we had fucoidan, a natural polysaccharide with intrinsic affinity toward P-selectin, and the chemotherapeutics cisplatin and mitoxantrone coassembled into a composite nanogel (FCM), and meanwhile exploited its P-selectin targeted therapeutic potentials in combination with radiotherapy using a murine breast cancer model. The radiation significantly enhanced the P-selectin level in tumor and subsequently boosted the cancer-targeted delivery of FCM. In current FCM, fucoidan not only acted as matrix for drugs encapsulation but also functioned as targeting ligand, thus providing a facile and P-selectin targeted codelivery of chemotherapeutics that could be potentiated by tumor radiation.",

    "abstract": "To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of strain sensors, a critical factor involves improving the change ratio of resistance in response to an external force. Traditional methods such as templating, prestretching, or asymmetric swelling can construct wrinkles on hydrogel but do not alter its conductive characteristics and improve the change ratio of resistance. Herein, we report an electrochemical protocol that can trigger homogeneous hydrogel to form the gradient distribution of mechanical strength and induce microscopic wrinkle patterns at the surface of hydrogel. The electrode reactions produce metal ions (Fe3+) inside the hydrogel, in which the electric field-driven ion migration results in the gradient distribution of Fe3+ ions, the closer to the wrinkle patterning surface of hydrogel, the higher content of Fe3+ ions. Large amounts of Fe3+ ions concentrate at the wrinkle surface, which improves the conductive characteristics of hydrogel. Therefore, upon compression at the wrinkle surface, the hydrogel sensor shows the higher change ratio of resistance. We demonstrate this feature by testing the weak vibration such as motion of soft brush and rolling of glass rods at the wrinkle surface of hydrogel, which shows the wrinkle patterns can improve the signal intensity of hydrogel sensor by two times. These results highlight the potential of our method for the construction of microscopic wrinkle structures to improve the sensitivity of hydrogel sensors.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the flexoelectric effect in semiconducting polymeric blend (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)) films. Flexoelectricity can be considered as an alternative transduction mechanism to the piezoelectricity to directly detect curvature. It is simply defined as the coupling between the strain gradient and polarization in solid dielectrics and semiconductors. In this study, flexoelectricity in PEDOT:PSS films works on the basis of electrical energy generation induced by dynamic bending. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of polarity change during bending, i.e., the reversal of the polarization direction. In this paper, the procedure to obtain free-standing PEDOT:PSS polymer films for mechanical/electrical bending conversion based on the flexoelectric effect is presented. Here, we report the flexoelectric characterization of 30-μm-thick flexible films of PEDOT:PSS encapsulated between two polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets. This characterization reveals a much higher transverse flexoelectric coefficient than those recently reported in the literature for free-standing PEDOT:PSS films with a coefficient that reaches 76 μC/m at 0.5 Hz. It was also demonstrated that it was possible to determine the curvature of the sample up to 62 m–1 through signal acquisition of the current and thus the possibility of using the encapsulated PEDOT:PSS films as a large curvature sensor. Their efficiency in converting a strain gradient into electrical energy, combined with their robustness and flexibility, may open a promising route toward organic semiconductors-based curvature sensors and ambient mechanical energy harvesting devices with large effective flexoelectric coefficients.",

In this work, we develop a series of MOF-based MMMs by blending postsynthetically modified variants of UiO-66-NH2 with poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate). The modification of UiO-66-NH2 with sulfate groups initially resulted in poor dispersion throughout the MMMs, but when dual-modified with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), MOF dispersion throughout the MMM was improved, and ionic conductivity was significantly higher than the UiO-66-NH2 MMMs. Furthermore, the dual-modified MMMs demonstrated excellent size-selectivity by blocking redox active species transport.

Solid-sate UV–vis and ESR spectra verified the strong visible light absorption and free radical characteristics of the host–guest MOFs. Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed the structure–function relationship. The rich hydrogen-bonding interactions between the host and guest should be responsible for the efficient charge transfer between the host MOF and guest and its excellent optoelectronic activity. The superior electron transfer between the radical MOF and catalytic centers contributed to the enhanced catalytic performance.

In this work, two isomeric nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) ThMeCl-1 and ThMeCl-2, having the methyl and chlorine atoms attached on different positions of the electron-withdrawing end group, are synthesized and incorporated as the third component in ternary solar cells. Although these NFA isomers exhibit a similar bandgap, energy levels, and energy loss in their PM6 based binary devices, the efficiency enhancements in ternary devices differ significantly. Compared to ThMeCl-1, the incorporation of ThMeCl-2 in PM6:C5-16 solar cells enables less energy loss, leading to an extra 0.03 eV open-circuit voltage gain and a maximum efficiency increase from 17.8 to 18.9%. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this is attributed to the versatile intermolecular π–π stacking forms between ThMeCl-2 and the host NFA, which result in improved charge transport and suppressed recombination. This work provides a rational guidance for controlling the molecular packing in ternary systems to prepare high performance organic photovoltaics.",

This work uses pump–probe microscopy to compare excited-state dynamics in thin films fabricated from tethered perylene bisimide assemblies to those fabricated from noncovalent assemblies. On average, tethered films exhibit faster and more homogeneous excited-state lifetimes, consistent with stronger and more uniform intermolecular coupling. Optical measurements of excited-state diffusion show that the tethered film has ∼75% faster transport than the control film. Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling suggests that the reduction of site energetic disorder is sufficient to quantitatively explain the difference in diffusion coefficients.

The functionalized BUT-47(Tb) through post-modification in the defective RE6 clusters demonstrates to be capable of selective fluorescence detection of hydrogen peroxide. This work not only highlights the strength of reticular chemistry principles in designing stable RE-MOFs with intriguing structures but also offers smart platforms to tailor properties for specific applications.",

    "abstract": "Flavoenzymes play pivotal roles in biological electron transport chains, yet replicating their functions synthetically remains challenging. Here, we report the assembly of a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) with lysine-rich peptides to form a flavin-containing catalyst, which mimics the catalytic function of NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) by oxidizing NADH and undergoing FMN reduction. Lysine residues create a conducive microenvironment, promoting the proximity of FMN and NADH and their hydride transfer. The resulting FMNH– facilitates sequential cytochrome c and enzymatic oxygen reduction, while NADH regenerates from enzymatic glucose dehydrogenation, akin to specific cellular respiration steps. Thus, the synthetic flavoenzyme emulates protein complex I. Lysine peptides aid in spatially organizing FMN, cytochrome c, and glucose dehydrogenase. Stability experiments reveal the resilience of the catalyst to temperatures up to 85 °C with recyclability when immobilized on a polymer support. These findings inform the design of biomimetic catalytic materials for bioinspired processes, offering insights into prebiotic protein complex models.",

    "abstract": "Lead halide hybrids have emerged as highly efficient photocatalysts, yet their application in photocatalytic organic synthesis remains limited, largely due to their instability upon polar organics. Herein, we have developed an isoreticular synthetic strategy to functionalize lead chloride-based MOFs with azonbenzene units, a benchmark photoresponsive moiety. The three MOFs consist of isostructural 1D [PbCl]+ chains as SBUs and biphenyl/azobenzene dicarboxylates as struts. Compared with the parent biphenyl-MOF, the azobenzene-functionalized MOFs demonstrate broad wavelength coverage up to 620 nm. Their efficient photoinduced ligand-to-metal charge transfer affords enhanced electron–hole separation for long-lived free carriers. Among them, the 4,4′-azobenzene-functionalized MOF exhibits the most efficient photocatalytic aerobic oxidation in both C(sp3)-H photooxidation and benzylamine coupling. Meanwhile, these coordination assembled MOFs exhibit high stability in a wide pH range and polar organic compounds. This work showcases a rational strategy to modify lead halide hybrids at the molecular level while preserving the lattice topology.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical water-splitting processes are a safe, sustainable, and ecofriendly method to generate pure hydrogen, with minimal carbon emission. Typically, water reduction (hydrogen evolution) and oxidation (oxygen evolution) occur simultaneously, although such coupled processes lead to several limitations such as gas crossover, electrocatalyst degradation by reactive oxygen species, and more. This review presents several strategies to design decoupled water splitting devices, separating the two half-reactions spatially and temporally, to address several of these issues. The designs change according to the electrode materials, electrolyte, and decoupling strategy employed (redox mediator). The review describes how the decoupling mechanisms adopted affect different properties and lead to designs with optimal efficiency. It also focuses on their integration with renewable energy, which can be used to power each half-reaction independently. Lastly, the merits and constraints of the decoupled systems in addressing global environmental issues are discussed along with potential questions to further advance this technology-based strategy.",

However, a general process for forming highly conductive films with high spatial resolution on various substrates is lacking. This work describes a technique for forming PEDOT and polypyrrole films with high spatial resolution using vapor-phase polymerization (VPP). The process, reminiscent of classical black-and-white photography, employs a photosensitive VPP initiating film. UV light selectively deactivates the film, allowing oxidative polymerization in unexposed regions. Substrates are modified with N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]aniline to enhance adhesion. Optimizing the initiating film composition and exposure conditions achieves conductive lines as narrow as 15 μm with PEDOT conductivities over 1000 S cm–1. Mechanistic studies using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggest a critical role of oxidative decomposition by photoinitiated ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The resulting conductive patterns exhibit abrasion resistance on glass, retain conductivity when stretched on elastomers, and enable two-color electrochromic displays.",

To address the issues of additive agglomeration and phase separation within the polymer matrix, assembly of amphiphilic nanosheets at oil/water interfaces for costabilization is innovatively proposed. The critically dispersed graphene nanosheets, assisted by ionic liquid (IL) graft-exfoliation, can be chemically integrated into swelling-resistant polymeric networks through ultrasonic-induced gelation. Additionally, the synergistic effect between dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H2O binary solvents and charged polar terminal groups weakens the hydrogen bonding within water molecules, enabling the organohydrogel with reliable environmental tolerance and long-lasting moisture retention. Owing to its high mechanical stretchability, satisfactory sensitivity, and exceptional photothermal conversion behavior, the fast prepared organohydrogel is fabricated into an all-climate wearable sensor for daily activities detection and temperature sensing, which lays the groundwork for human–machine interaction and thermosensation-based actuation.",

    "abstract": "Polarimetric phototransistors have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to recognize the polarization state of incident linearly polarized light. However, advances in their development have been hindered by the low polarization sensitivity that results from the modest polarization dichroic ratios (PDRs) of the photoactive materials. In this study, we present polarimetric organic phototransistors (P-OPTs) with a remarkably high polarization sensitivity exceeding 8.0. These P-OPTs are fabricated by transferring highly stretched (∼200%) thin films of a polymer semiconductor, poly(4-(5-(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b']dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-octyl-7-(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole) (PCDTFBTA), which exhibits a high PDR of approximately 4.0. This improved polarization sensitivity ranks among the highest sensitivities reported for polarimetric phototransistors, demonstrating high photoresponsivity (R ≈ 500 A W–1), high external quantum efficiency (EQE ≈ 1000%), high photosensitivity (P ≈ 1.8 × 104), high specific detectivity (D* ≈ 5.9 × 1012 Jones), and short rise (τr ≈ 3.3 ms) and decay (τd ≈ 3.4 ms) times.",

    "abstract": "Great efforts have been devoted to designing organic molecular cages with a 3D topology and shape persistence. Yet, how to harness these cages as atomically precise, nanosized building blocks to construct hierarchical superstructures remains underexplored. Here we report a strategy that exploits functionalized organic cages as premade nanobuilding units and connects them into self-assemblies with structural hierarchy and tunable dimensionality. Using a triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3P═O)-paneled trigonal prism as vertex-decorated cage to connect with iodobenzene-capped bridging ligands (Ar–I), they can constitute infinite cage-based superstructures through weak P═O···I–Ar halogen-bonding interactions. Regulating the ligand configuration and valence can dictate the connecting direction to form 1D cage-to-chain (nanofilament) and 2D cage-to-framework (nanosheet) architectures and further hierarchically assemble into microwire and microplate materials. The cage-connecting assemblies possess larger void volume and dual porosity compared to their parent cage itself, which can be applied in selective encapsulation and bisubstrate cascade catalysis.",

Herein, a novel polycarbonate-based gel polymer electrolyte (PCPVC-GPE) with high Li+ conductivity up to 3.43 mS cm–1 at room temperature is reported. The PCPVC-GPE is synthesized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization and thiol–ene \"click\" chemistry from norbornene derivative monomer exhibiting a high electrochemical oxidation voltage (5.2 V) and superior compatibility with a Li metal anode. A Li/PCPVC-GPE/Li symmetrical cell delivers good cycling stability for 1900 h.

By leveraging the inherent properties of mExos, our goal is to ensure optimal efficacy by delivering a concentrated dose of the photosensitizer to the desired region. In this context, we developed photoresponsive mExos loaded with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6@mExo) for glioblastoma treatment. Intriguingly, our findings reveal that Ce6@mExo effectively traverses both the IEB and the BBB following oral administration, significantly accumulating in brain tissue. This enhanced accumulation correlates with substantial tumor cell death in a glioblastoma orthotopic model upon laser irradiation.

Here, we successfully synthesized a high-entropy ruthenium-based oxide (RuMnFeCoNiO-HEO) with rich grain boundaries using a fast and nonequilibrium molten salt method. The RuMnFeCoNiO-HEO with significantly reduced ruthenium dosage could exhibit much higher OER performance with a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and long-term durability of 100-h continuous operation under 100 mA/cm2 in alkaline solution. The mass activity and turnover frequency of RuFeCoNiMn-HEO are significantly enhanced by nearly 1 order of magnitude compared to those of commercial RuO2. Microstructural characterizations reveal that the incorporation of four extra 3d transition metals into ruthenium oxides results in the formation of Ru-based high-entropy materials with a rich grain boundary structure and unsaturated coordination Ru active centers, which optimize both the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical durability of RuMnFeCoNiO-HEO during the OER process.",

While polymer network reorganization can be enabled with dynamic bond exchange, this strategy typically faces intrinsic trade-offs between healability, processability, and mechanical performance. Thus, new material design strategies that can overcome these trade-offs are needed. Here, we report the use of multivalent polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs) as reinforcing fillers for self-healing photoresins. As each nanoparticle is functionalized with thousands of polymer chains engaging in multivalent interactions with the surrounding elastomeric matrix, the bulk modulus of the composite can be increased without impairing the local segmental motion of polymer chains necessary for self-healing. We also examine PGNP structural parameters to establish structure–property relationships that permit fine-tuning of composite mechanical performance. Finally, these enhancements do not impair the materials' manufacturability, as they can be used as feedstocks for digital light printing to produce complex and high-resolution 3D objects.",

A reverse lithium-ion battery (RLiB) method, utilizing a lithium-ion sieve to directly extract Li+ from brine, offers the advantages of high selectivity and environmental friendliness. However, implementation of RLiB systems has been hindered by the limited cycling stability of the LiMn2O4 material. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel RA-LiMn2O4 material with a core–shell structure, incorporating rutile-anatase (RA) as the shell and spinel LiMn2O4 as the core to enhance stability. Remarkably, the RA-LiMn2O4 material demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, maintaining full capacity even after 100 cycles of charging–discharging in an aqueous LiCl electrolyte. Moreover, concentration polarization during lithium extraction is alleviated, and Li+ is successfully extracted from real brine (309 ppm of Li+) using RA-LiMn2O4 as the working electrode. This work presents an ultrastable RA-LiMn2O4 material for lithium extraction from real brine.",

We highlight that excess doping induced a solid-state molecular reorientation from edge-on to face-on, initiating a decline in charge mobility within crystalline domains, despite improvements in interdomain charge transport. Furthermore, we showcase a quantitative methodology to probe interdomain transport efficiency, taking activation energy Wγ derived from weighted mobility as a key indicator.

In the tumor microenvironment, ZCCP NPs decompose in response to H+ and glutathione (GSH), releasing Zn and Co ions that increase intracellular ROS. Additionally, the TMPyP ligand converts to Phlorin under near-infrared (NIR) excitation, raising tumor site temperature and increasing cancer cell susceptibility to cuproptosis. Elevated ROS and temperature activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and Caspase-1, leading to gasdermin D cleavage and pyroptosis. Enhanced ROS generation impairs mitochondrial function and reduces copper efflux protein ATP7A expression, promoting cuproptosis. This strategy combines pyroptosis and cuproptosis for effective tumor treatment.",

This work reveals that changing ethylene into a butadiene π-bridge can efficiently extend absorption wavelength and promote the nonradiative transition. Specifically, the butadiene π-bridge not only extends the π-conjugation length but also disrupts the S···O interlocking, which facilitates intramolecular torsions and rotations and enhances the intramolecular charge transfer for the molecule with butadiene π-bridge. As a result, very broad absorption with a 70 nm red-shift is observed, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BTVIC nanoparticles reaches 82.6%. Ultimately, photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) applications in vivo demonstrate a deep penetration depth of over 7 mm and an efficient anti-tumor effect. This work illustrates that modifying the π-bridge is a practical strategy for regulating A-D-A interactions and developing more efficient phototheranostic agents.",

Unfortunately, the adsorbed hydroxyl groups tend to cover Ru surfaces, making Ru unable to adsorb hydrogen, resulting in sluggish HOR kinetics. In this work, we demonstrate that alkaline HOR kinetics on Ru can be accelerated by combining it with highly oxophilic MoO2. Resulting from the stronger oxophilicity of MoO2, hydroxyl groups preferentially adsorb on MoO2, allowing Ru sites to adsorb hydrogen, thus facilitating HOR kinetics. Guided by the theoretical calculations, we synthesize a Ru/MoO2 catalyst for HOR, achieving a mass activity of 5.17 A mgPGM–1, which is 13.6 times greater than that of commercial 20% Pt/C. Notably, a peak power density of 1.09 W cm–2 is achieved using this Ru/MoO2 catalyst as the anode in an anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC).",

    "abstract": "MoS2 is regarded as one of the most promising potassium-ion battery (PIB) anodes. Despite the great progress to enhance its electrochemical performance, understanding of the electrochemical mechanism to store K-ions in MoS2 remains unclear. This work reports that the K storage process in MoS2 follows a complex reaction pathway involving the conversion reactions of Mo and S, showing both cationic redox activity of Mo and anionic redox activity of S. The presence of dual redox activity, characterized in-depth through synchrotron X-ray absorption, X-ray photoelectron, Raman, and UV–vis spectroscopies, reveals that the irreversible Mo oxidation during the depotassiation process directs the reaction pathway toward S oxidation, which leads to the occurrence of K–S electrochemistry in the (de)potassiation process. Moreover, the dual reaction pathway can be adjusted by controlling the discharge depth at different cycling stages of MoS2, realizing a long-term stable cycle life of MoS2 as a PIB anode.",

Despite this, there is a surprising lack of a systematic study of antiperovskite surfaces and their influence on the performance of these materials in energy storage applications. This is rectified here by providing a comprehensive density functional theory investigation of the surfaces of M3OX (M = Li or Na; X = Cl or Br) antiperovskites. Specifically, we focus on the stability, electronic structure, defect chemistry, and ion transport properties of stable antiperovskite surfaces and how these contribute to the overall performance and suitability of these materials as solid electrolytes. The findings presented here provide critical insights for the design of antiperovskite surfaces that are both stable and promote ion transport in solid-state batteries.",

Here we synthesized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting highly branched poly(β-amino ester)s (ER-HPAEs) and investigated their potential for skin gene delivery. The incorporation of methyl-benzenesulfonamide (NMS) moieties endowed ER-HPAEs with a strong ER-targeting ability, allowing ER-HPAE/DNA polyplexes to bypass the conventional endosomal pathway and facilitate nuclear internalization. The optimized ER-HPAEs exhibited high transfection efficiency and biocompatibility across multiple cell types, surpassing the performance of Lipofectamine 3000 (Lipo3000). Intriguingly, the ER-HPAEs can effectively deliver plasmids to mediate high-levels of transglutaminase 1 (TGM1), membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase site 1 (MBTPS1), and collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1) expression both in vitro and in vivo. This study establishes a strategy for synthesizing HPAEs with ER-targeting ability and identifies potential candidates for skin gene delivery.",

    "abstract": "Perovskites ABO3 are very versatile catalysts that can change their structure in several ways to enhance their electrocatalytic properties. Among nickel-based perovskites, those containing lanthanum or alkaline earth elements at the A-site display notable potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Properties of nickel-based perovskites include the formation of mixed nickel oxidation states and the remarkable ability to accommodate numerous oxygen vacancies within their lattice. Oxygen vacancy content is an effective method to boost the electrocatalytic performance, and nickelate perovskites include a fascinating family of materials that exhibit oriented lattice oxygen vacancies: the infinite layer nickelates. However, nickelate perovskites remain a relatively underexplored area of research, likely due to the challenges associate with their synthesis. A major challenge lies in understanding the dynamic self-reconstruction of nickel-based perovskites under OER conditions. Monitoring this self-reconstruction through operando characterization is essential for precisely unraveling the causes of catalyst transformation and understanding the OER mechanisms. Leveraging these findings enables the design of more effective catalysts. In this Perspective, we aim to provide a summary of recent advances, insights, and suggestions for the development of nickel-based perovskites for electrocatalytic OER in alkaline electrolytes.",

This new approach not only simplifies the synthesis process but also significantly expands the types of chemical linkages available for COF construction. The resulting En-COF-P exhibits an enhanced visible light absorption range, facilitating improved charge generation and separation. These properties translate into remarkable photocatalytic performance, particularly in the blue-light-driven selective oxidation of organic sulfides, where En-COF-P achieves up to 99% conversion and 99% selectivity. Remarkably, En-COF-P's photocatalytic efficiency is eight times higher than that of traditional imine-linked COFs. This work underscores the potential of click polymerization in COF synthesis and advances a new strategy for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts.",

Currently, mainstream transition-metal ions (Cr3+, Mn4+, etc.) and lanthanides (Nd3+, Yb3+, etc.) activated NIR phosphors suffer from the low absorption efficiency due to the spin-forbidden d-d or f-f transitions. Herein, we present a robust (Ba,Sr)Al3Si3O4N5:Sm2+ NIR phosphor that exhibits a broad-band peaking at 758 nm with high absorption efficiency stemming from the spin-allowed 4f-5d transition. The lowest excited level in 4f6 (5D0) is equivalent to the 4f55d1 of Sm2+, as evidenced by the temperature-dependent (5–300 K) emission spectra. The emission peaks of Sm2+ in these oxynitride phosphors can be tuned between 742 and 789 nm by simply changing the doping concentration. The optimized NIR phosphor exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, making it highly promising in encryption and nondestructive inspection.

Hence, its detection in air has become very significant. Herein, for the first time, a metal organic nanotube (MONT) is being used for the detection of nicotine from cigarette smoke at room temperature. MONT is a unique class of metal-organic framework (MOF) where independent one-dimensional tubular structures are formed. MONT, [Zn3(btc)2(μ3-OH)(DMF)]·H2O (1), reported here, possesses distinctive structural features, i.e., three differently shaped porous channels (circular, star, and oval), formed by periodic linkage of btc with Zn, giving rise to the formation of a highly porous framework structure. When exposed to cigarette smoke in the presence of sunlight, this MONT display a gasochromic effect, i.e., a significant color change from light yellow to dark pink within just 20 s. A high sensitivity with low detection limit of ∼ 23.3 μM was witnessed. The significance of this work lies in the visible-light-assisted, fast, easy, naked-eye, specific sensing of nicotine from cigarette smoke, which is the first of its kind.",

    "abstract": "Studies of particle-stabilized biphasic structures have greatly expanded the possibilities of multiphasic systems by producing liquid composites with unique morphologies and properties. The solvent transfer-induced phase separation (STRIPS) method was previously introduced to prepare bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels), a unique class of particle-stabilized biphasic structures. Although STRIPS enables continuous processing, the requirement of an external aqueous phase may limit its application. In this work, a new method to produce a variety of three-dimensional multiphasic structures including bijels via vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) is demonstrated. VIPS enables the fabrication of films and coatings by spreading or spraying a particle-laden suspension onto a surface without the need of an outer aqueous phase. Intriguingly, secondary nucleation of structures occurs within phase separated domains, leading to hierarchically bicontinuous biphasic structures. The dimensions of phase separated domains can be controlled by the rate of cosolvent removal. Moreover, a different path to bicontinuous morphology is identified, which does not occur via spinodal decomposition but rather relies on the formation of percolating structures of partially coalesced particle-covered droplets. The VIPS process provides a scalable path to produce bicontinuous biphasic composites with hierarchical structures for advanced coatings and membranes applications.",

We initiated a suite of simulation-based studies of CQD solar cells and found a route to improved performance by increasing the degree of p-type behavior.

Compared to the colors created by plasmonic metasurfaces, plasmonic colors generated by colloidal plasmonic nanostructures are of narrower spectral line widths and sharper and purer chromaticity. However, difficulties in the active control of plasmonic colors hinder the development from static plasmonic color pixels into dynamic plasmonic color devices. Moreover, functional plasmon-based applications usually involve plasmonic nanostructures supported on substrates that strongly alter the plasmonic far-field scattering properties. Au nanorings are emerging plasmonic nanostructures with an intriguing ring shape and controllable plasmon wavelengths. Herein, we report on a study of the substrate effect on the far-field scattering properties of colloidal Au nanorings. The in-plane and out-of-plane plasmon modes of the Au nanorings deposited on metallic films can be excited in varying proportions, which are dependent on the incidence angle of light, producing distinct, and controllable far-field scattering plasmonic colors. Color switching is further realized on the designed patterns made out of the Au nanorings by photolithography. Our study not only provides a fundamental understanding of the substrate effect on the plasmonic properties of uncommon metal nanostructures but also opens the possibility for creating new functional metallic nanostructures for dynamic color devices and anti-counterfeiting applications.",

Here, we demonstrate a retrosynthetic approach to access morphologically complex colloidal nanoparticles by combining partial sequential cation exchange reactions with chemical etching. Rational synthesis of the targeted nanoparticles containing ZnS, CdS, or CoS began by identifying heterostructured nanorod precursors that contained precisely located regions of Cu1.8S, which were subsequently etched with trioctylphosphine in the presence of oxygen to generate the desired product. Appropriate heterostructured nanorod precursors were then synthesized by replacing some of the Cu+ cations in colloidal Cu1.8S nanorods with Zn2+, Cd2+, or Co2+, using exchange sequences that were known to produce the desired features. The residual Cu1.8S was then dissolved, converting the Cu1.8S regions into void space. Mixed-population samples were also used to explore and identify a wider swath of potential retrosynthetic pathways and targeted morphologies, as well as morphological tunability. Collectively, several new classes of complex nanoparticles were synthesized, including nanoparticles having a flat end on one side and a faceted tip on the other, nanoparticles having a different material on the top and bottom, and nanoparticles having various protrusions and notches.",

    "abstract": "Although high-quality gold nanorods can be routinely synthesized, within a wide range of sizes and aspect ratios, a similar level of control has not been reached for silver nanorods. Whereas seeded-growth processes have been developed, the reported methods have not met sufficient interest, mainly because of limited quality, particularly when small size (short diameter) and small aspect ratios are targeted. In the surfactant-driven seeded growth of gold nanorods, the success of the synthesis is largely dependent on the quality and stability of the seeds, and thus related methods have been reported for the seeded growth of Ag nanorods, using penta-twinned Au nanorods and bipyramids as seeds. However, Ag nanorods with diameters of >30 nm are consistently obtained, restricting their potential applications. We report the preparation of high-quality silver nanorods, using either small bipyramids or small decahedra as seeds, with special attention to the location of the seeds, either at the center (bipyramids) or at one end (decahedra) of the resulting nanorods.",

Our Ni3S4 catalyst with low-energy facets achieves a 6.8 ± 3.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NRR, compared to 1.9 ± 3.6% for a control of the same crystal structure and composition but with a more disordered surface. First-principles calculations reveal that the synthetic conditions allow choosing whether Ni-rich or S-rich surfaces would be more stable, which affects the coordination of the active Ni site and its reactivity. In addition, the combination of Lewis acid and Lewis base sites allows separating the adsorption of different reactants, resulting in a suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.",

The effective Debye temperatures for sulfur in ZrS3 are found to be 558 ± 30 K and 667 ± 35 K, again, for the two different types of sulfur coordination. The differences in the Debye temperatures for the different sulfur species in both TiS3 and ZrS3, are consistent with the existence of inequivalent sulfur environments. Moreover, considerably higher Debye temperature for S 2p core-level of ZrS3, in comparison with that of TiS3, indicates that there is a likely decrease in phonon scattering of carriers in ZrS3 compared to TiS3. This conclusion is supported by a temperature-dependent maximum in the mobility for ZrS3, that is at a higher temperature than seen for TiS3 and a steeper decline in mobility for TiS3, compared to ZrS3. Because of the relatively high Debye temperatures, there are only a limited number of soft modes for the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) layered trichalcogenide semiconductors of TiS3 and ZrS3.",

However, most TMDC homo- and heterostacks are created by onerous mechanical exfoliation, followed by a mixing-and-matching process. While versatile enough for pilot demonstrations, these strategies are clearly not scalable for practical technologies and widespread implementations. Here, we report a two-step epitaxy strategy that promotes the growth of second-layer TMDCs on the basal plane of the first TMDCs epilayer. The first-layer TMDCs are grown on substrates where the tensile strength can be tuned by the control of chemical environments. The succeeding epilayers then prefer to grow layer-by-layer on the highly tensile-strained first layers. The result is the growth of high-density TMDC homo (WSe2) bilayers and hetero (WSe2–MoS2) bilayers with an exceedingly high yield (>99% bilayers) and uniformity. A density functional theory simulation further sheds light on how strain engineering shifts the subsequent layer growth preference. Second-harmonic generation and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy collectively attest to the AB and AA′ stacking between the TMDC epi- and overlayers. The proposed strategy could be a versatile platform for synthesizing diverse arrays of vdW homo- and heterostacks, thus providing prospects for realizing large-scale and layer-controllable two-dimensional electronics.",

Exfoliation of bulk MoS2 in mesogen-containing solutions produced stable dispersions of 2D-MoS2 that retained suspension stability for several weeks. Solvent removal in cast films yielded nanocomposites of 2D-MoS2. Preservation of single- and few-sheet MoS2 was confirmed utilizing UV–vis and Raman spectroscopy in the nematic and isotropic fluid states of the system and, remarkably, in the solid crystal as well. Importantly, the MoS2 nanosheets remained well-dispersed upon polymerization of the reactive mesogen to form a liquid crystal polymer. The ability to stably disperse 2D-MoS2 in a structured fluid opens up new possibilities for studying anisotropic properties of MoS2 and for exploiting such properties in responsive materials.",

Herein, well-dispersed Sb atoms with high-loading of 23.3 wt % anchored in sulfur-rich amorphous carbon-coated reduced graphene oxide matrix (SbSA/C) are prepared by a coordinative and spatial coconfinement methodology including freeze-casting the well-dissolved Sb-chelates (Sb-thioglycolate) within graphene oxide suspension and post heating-treatment. The reduced graphene oxide substrate features open two-dimensional spatial framework for loading atomically dispersive Sb species, and the pyrolyzed Sb-chelates would provide not only massive desirable heteroatoms (S, O) for coordinating the Sb atoms but also in situ pyrolytic carbon for further spatially separating those dispersive atoms. The coordinative and spatial coconfinement engineering also endows the SbSA/C composite with atomic-level Sb atoms against migration and agglomeration during electrochemical K-storage cycling. In situ TEM reveals the uniform potassiation behavior of the SbSA/C without obvious volume change; DFT calculation and electrochemical characterization suggest the significantly lower K-ion diffusion energy barrier. Therefore, on the basis of both the active Sb center and the coordinative heteroatom, the SbSA/C electrode delivers high fast-charging capacity, outstanding rate capability and long-lifespan performance in half/full K-ion batteries (e.g., a stable capacity of 331.3 mA h g–1 is maintained over 1100 cycles at 1.0 A g–1 for half-cell).",

Furthermore, the molecule was sensitive to the O–H hydrogen-bond donor. The emission could be switched from 420 to 470 nm and enhanced in intensity with the presence of oxhydryl. This work may facilitate the understanding of the TL mechanism and guide the design of efficient organic TL material.

All three compounds show almost temperature-independent and weak paramagnetic responses to an applied magnetic field at cryogenic temperatures, indicating phase-pure products. The key to synthesizing these ternary materials is an initial low-temperature step (300–450 °C) to promote Mg-M-N nucleation. The intermediates then are annealed (800–900 °C) to grow crystalline domains of the ternary product. Calorimetry experiments reveal that initial reaction temperatures are determined by phase transitions of reaction precursors, whereas heating directly to high temperatures results in decomposition. These two-step reactions provide a rational guide to material discovery of other bulk ternary nitrides.",

Currently, the commonly used method to prepare the lead source is based on a fire smelting process, requiring a high temperature of more than 1000 °C, which results in environmental pollution. Spent car lead acid batteries are an environmentally hazardous waste; however, they can alternatively serve as an abundant and inexpensive Pb source. Due to \"self-purification\", quantum dots feature a high tolerance of impurities in the precursor since the impurities tend to be expelled from the small crystalline cores during colloidal nucleation. Herein, PbI2 recycled from spent lead acid batteries via a facile low-temperature solution process is used to synthesize CsPbI3 quantum dots, which simultaneously brings multiple benefits including (1) avoiding pollution originating from the fire smelting process; (2) recycling the Pb waste from batteries; and (3) synthesizing high-quality quantum dots. The resulting CsPbI3 quantum dots have photophysical properties such as PLQY and carrier lifetimes on par with those synthesized from the commercial PbI2 due to expelling of the impurity Na atoms. The resulting solar cells deliver comparable power conversion efficiencies: 14.0% for the cells fabricated using recycled PbI2 and 14.7% for the cells constructed using commercial PbI2.

    "abstract": "Intermetallic compounds have attracted considerable attention as advanced structure materials with special properties. While a range of powder metallurgy methods have been developed to synthesize intermetallics, these approaches typically feature slow heating rates and therefore sluggish interdiffusion between the precursor powders, ending up with multiphase products with different metallic ratios. However, single-phase intermetallics offer more controllable properties for materials design yet remain difficult to achieve because of the synthetic limits. Herein, we report a target-sintering approach to synthesize a range of single-phase intermetallics, the stoichiometry of which is simply dictated by the chemical composition of the used precursors without any intermediate phase formation. This unique process is enabled by an ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) method, which crucially offers fast temperature ramping (up to 103–104 °C/min vs. 101–102 °C/min in the conventional methods) to avoid phase impurity, as well as short sintering time to limit elemental loss. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we synthesized, for the first time, a range of single-phase Ti–Al intermetallics, such as Ti3Al (phase fraction of 99.5%) and TiAl3 (phase fraction of 91.8%). This approach is promising for application to other intermetallic and alloy systems where target-sintering can be used to achieve a variety of single-phase materials.",

Recently, LLPS condensates have been reported to regulate the membrane structure upon wetting. However, the opposite possibility, i.e., whether membrane wetting regulates the LLPS, remains unexplored. Using variously sized droplets of short polyethylene glycol (PEG) and long dextran blends encapsulated with a lipid membrane, we demonstrate that membrane wetting regulates LLPS in cell-sized spaces and alters the equilibrium state. In small droplets, the two-phase region expands beyond the bulk, and the degree of fractionation increases as the droplet size decreases. We explain the space-size-dependent LLPS from the higher wettability of short PEG than dextran.

    "abstract": "Nanoporous materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are attractive due to their extremely high surface areas and porosities, but they are susceptible to pore collapse and loss of crystallinity. Prior studies reported complete pore collapse above a threshold surface tension for the activation solvents. In this study, we show that the degree of pore collapse can be precisely controlled by using a mixture of high and low surface tension solvents for activation. We further demonstrate that pore collapse is an irreversible process, in which partially collapsed COFs can collapse further using high surface tension solvents but cannot recover their structural integrity by activation with low surface tension solvents. Finally, we show that the solvent surface tension is the most important characteristic that governs pore collapse of COFs during solvent activation, and the activation temperature, pressure, washing time, and number of activation cycles has negligible impact on the final COF porosity and crystallinity. This work provides novel insight into pore collapse of COFs, a method to systematically tune surface area, and guidance on the development of effective activation methods to produce highly crystalline and porous COFs. These findings will be useful for the preparation of COFs and other nanoporous materials.",

High concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can directly induce cell apoptosis and necrosis, so it is an effective strategy to increase the ROS content in tumor cells. In recent years, ROS-mediated cancer therapy has been extensively studied. As an important transition-metal element, Mn plays a key role in biological processes. With the rapid development of nanotechnology and oncology, Mn-based materials have been widely used in ROS-mediated cancer therapy as an ideal integrated nanoplatform. This review first summarizes the research progress of Mn-based nanomaterials (NMs), including their structures and main synthesis methods. Then the biomedical applications of Mn-based NMs for ROS-mediated cancer therapy are brought into focus. Finally, the challenges and development directions of Mn-based NMs used for ROS-mediated cancer therapy are rationally analyzed, which are necessary for their future clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Small strategic perturbations of the molecular structures impart significant variation in the evolution dynamics and properties of supramolecular self-assembled architectures. However, probing the in situ evolution dynamics of molecular assembly remains a challenge. Herein, we unraveled the real-time, early stage environment-sensitive dynamic molecular self-assembly processes and stimuli-induced reversible morphological transformation between supramolecular fibers and spherical nanoaggregates of alkyl chain-substituted phenanthroimidazole-based luminogen (BPIB1) through fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The presence of an octyl chain and basic nitrogen centers in BPIB1 led to a distinct self-assembly pattern. The gradual progression in the fluorescence lifetime provides a unique strategy for elucidating the dynamics of the self-assembly process leading to distinct nano/microarchitectures. Among the varied self-assembled structures, the smaller-sized (diameter ∼ 20–30 nm), highly photostable, water-dispersible, and biocompatible fluorescent nanoaggregates of BPIB1 were employed for tracking the dynamics of lipid droplets in live cells and a model organism, C. elegans, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and FLIM. Thus, a combined microscopic and spectroscopic approach demonstrated in the present study opens up new avenues to explore the formation pathways of diverse molecular aggregates and their use to decipher complex organelle dynamics.",

Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene can modify the growth of metals, but the impact of 2D interlayers on electrodeposition processes is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the electrodeposition of Zn and Cu onto graphene-coated Cu substrates. Through electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the crystallographic orientation of the underlying Cu plays a dominant role in determining the orientation of electrodeposits despite the presence of graphene. The data suggest that the electrodeposits grow via remote epitaxy, where the structure of the Cu influences the deposit through the graphene. The graphene also modifies nucleation behavior. These results demonstrate that metal electrodeposition can be influenced by the substrate beneath graphene, which suggests that electrodeposition of a variety of metals could be controlled through judicious choice of substrate to enable desired growth morphologies.",

    "abstract": "The widespread and advanced application of polymers outshines the current ability to theoretically predict their radiation deterioration without much prior knowledge. This work presents a versatile methodology to simulate and forecast the radiochemical damage of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam. The radiolytic kinetics of PDMS foam in radiation-thermal environments is first studied by multiscale simulations with experimental verification. Then the radiolytic kinetic model of PDMS is developed via material informatics gained from experiments, reactive force field simulations, and density functional theory calculations, involving the paramount elementary reactions and other events in the physical, physicochemical, and chemical stages. The model configuration is designed to interactively couple with the service conditions and structural relationships, which enables the model to allow for the intricate radiation-thermal coupling effect, dose rate effect, and postradiation effect. To improve the adaptivity and accuracy of the model and further rationalize the radiolytic kinetics frame, the diffusion coefficients and reaction rate constants with temperature, topology, and morphology dependence are calculated. The developed radiolytic kinetic model can precisely predict the deteriorated PDMS system from various aspects simultaneously, including gas yields, radiation chemical yields, and damaged molecular structure and cross-linking network. The overall accuracy in view of the standard deviation calculated from the normalized data is less than 0.35. The proposed methodology has a promising future in nonempirical simulations, multiscale understanding, and goal-oriented harnessing of the structure–property relationships of polymers.",

In the normoxic region, Cy-NO2 in the nanomedicine plays the role of photosensitizer under 808 nm laser irradiation to realize effective PDT, while in hypoxic intracellular conditions, the Cy-NO2 will be converted into a photothermal agent, which can induce the decomposition of ADVN through photothermal effect to generate toxic free radicals for thermodynamic therapy. Therefore, by identifying the environmental characteristics and transforming treatment approaches, this nanomedicine can achieve good therapeutic effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

Since fibrosis worsens the prognosis in NASH, developing a method to monitor fibrosis activity in NASH is demanded. Considering that lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme that promotes crosslinking of extracellular matrix, plays an important role in fibrosis, collagen with an aldehyde group as LOX-catalyzed product can be utilized as a molecular imaging target for fibrosis detection. LOX can oxidize lysine with an amine group on collagen to allysine with an aldehyde group. Here, we developed an activatable imaging probe TPAH with an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property. Its fluorescence can be turned on due to restricted intramolecular motion after reaction with collagen in the active fibrogenesis site with enhanced LOX activity. In vivo studies demonstrated that NASH mice showed stronger fluorescence signal in the liver than healthy mice after intravenous administration of TPAH. However, the enhanced fluorescence signal in NASH mice was markedly weakened after treatment with a LOX inhibitor, validating the LOX specifity of the allysine-reactive AIE probe. Therefore, TPAH is promising to monitor fibrosis progression at an early stage in NASH.",

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic membrane reactors (PMRs) are a class of useful devices for removing micropollutants from aquatic environments, in which three-dimensional (3D) structures on membranes are particularly anticipated to benefit from ultralow concentration treatment. However, they lack the photocatalytic materials that are highly active and can be well integrated with membranes to maintain 3D structures. Here, we demonstrated that the assembly of two-dimensional (2D) photocatalytic material and conducting material into 3D structures can perfectly address this challenge. As a proof of concept, atomically thin bismuth oxychloride with rich defects (D-BiOCl) was first integrated with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to form a 3D composite for photocatalytic pollutant degradation, validating the potential application of 2D material assembly in designing a 3D membrane. As a result, the optimized D-BiOCl/RGO composite reached 97.2% photocatalytic degradation efficiency for tetracycline (TC, 10 mg L–1) in 2 h, with excellent stability and recyclability after 5 cycles of reaction, proving the high activity of defect sites. Furthermore, we explored the integration of D-BiOCl/RGO with a poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane, which was used in a PMR for photocatalytic TC degradation in the concentration range of 50 ng L–1 to 1 mg L–1 in a flow-through mode. Notably, in a 100 ng L–1 TC solution, the maximum removal rate reached 84% at 25 °C, 250 mW cm–2, and 25 L m–2 h–1, demonstrating the key role of the 3D structure. This work provides an approach to the removal of micropollutants with enhanced performance and gains insight into the design of water treatment membranes via synergism of active sites and material assembly.",

    "abstract": "Stimuli-responsive membranes that enable the smart control of membrane transport properties represent an interesting class of materials for a wide range of separation processes. In this work, surface-initiated, electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to grow poly(acrylic acid) brushes from the surface of a percolating network of carbon nanotubes coating an ultrafiltration membrane. Brush molecular weights as high as 930 kDa were achieved, with very low dispersivity. When no potential was applied, the material was able to reject 88% of 12 kDa dextran in 50 mM NaCl solution. Membrane rejection and flux were readily changed upon the application of electrical potentials, with positive potentials increasing flux by 85% and reducing rejection by 56%, while negative potentials reduced flux by 30% and increased rejection by 5%. We show evidence that counterion migration, moving in response to the applied electric field, is responsible for the expansion or collapse of the grafted charged polymer brushes, which induced or eliminated pore gating. In addition, atomic force microscopy was used to probe the forces exerted by brush conformational changes in response to the applied field. These materials can find applications in industrial separations where gating is needed and may possess interesting anti-fouling properties.",

If the free carrier concentration is high enough, localized plasmon resonances can be sustained in nanocrystals, with frequencies in the infra-red (<1 eV), with respect to the typical resonances seen in the visible range in the case of metals (Ag, Au, ...). The localization of the resonances can be demonstrated with scanning transmission electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) by combining high spatial and high energy resolutions. Here we demonstrate that Cu(I) vacancies can be directly measured from the STEM images in Cu(3-x)P hexagonal nanocrystals. Two localized resonances can be seen from STEM-EELS, which are in agreement with the resonances calculated from the vacancy concentration obtained from the STEM.",

The resulting material (hereafter referred to as \"HPHT-C3N3P\") was characterized using a variety of techniques, including X-ray scattering, pair distribution function analysis, 31P, 13C, 15N magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman and IR spectroscopies. The measurements indicate that HPHT-C3N3P lacks long-range structural order with a local structure predominantly composed of a sp2, s-triazine-like network in which phosphorus atoms substitute for bridging nitrogen sites found in related C3N4 materials. The HPHT-C3N3P sample exhibits semiconducting properties, with electrical transport dominated by variable-range hopping. The high phosphorus content of HPHT-C3N3P (approaching 13 at. %) is associated with a major decrease in the optical absorption edge (∼0.4 eV) and a ∼1010-fold increase in electrical conductivity, as compared to previously-reported P-doped graphitic g-C3N4 (0.6-3.8 at. % P). The HPHT-C3N3P sample is considerably harder than layered g-C3N4 and exhibits superior thermal stability up to ∼700 °C in air. These results demonstrate a remarkable range of tunable properties possible for C3N4-related materials through elemental substitution and provide valuable information to guide the design of new materials.",

    "abstract": "Conventional superconductivity is a phenomenon where lattice vibrations, phonons, steer electrons through a solid with zero resistance. We theoretically predict such phonon-mediated superconductivity to occur in a covalent triazine framework, CTF-0, when it is intercalated with Li or Na. Porous CTF-0 is computed to possess several anticipated properties of interest, such as low-lying π*-bands that can be partially doped, as well as electrostatic anchoring points that improve the stability of the functionalized structures. However, it is the integral porosity that plays a surprisingly crucial role in driving superconductivity, by providing the space for donor atoms to engage in highly localized vibrational modes. These low-frequency rattling phonons couple strongly to the free π*-electrons, and they work in concert with in-plane aromatic-ring vibrations of the framework at a higher frequency. We compute a markedly improved critical temperature (Tc) for Li-decorated CTF-0 (6.2 K) over graphite-intercalation compound LiC6 (predicted at 0.9 K), an improvement that relates directly to the porosity of the material. We also predict a further enhancement of the Tc upon substitution with larger Na (9.1 K), which engages in more localized rattling phonons. This work proposes that CTFs and kindred porous frameworks can be a hub for an exciting new class of materials, for which tunable porosity gives control over superconducting properties.",

Most studies examine these materials as bulk polymer electrolyte membranes, and comparatively little attention has been given to their behavior on electrode surfaces as thin films. This report demonstrates that sequence-defined peptides anchored to electrode surfaces, or the solvent vapor annealing processing, alters the microstructure configuration of anion exchange ionomers (AEIs). It is observed that moderately sized microphase-separated ionic domains of the AEI, obtained either by peptide-modified electrodes or solvent vapor annealing, give rise to a two- to three-fold increase in thin-film in-plane ionic conductivity. Interestingly, the use of peptide-modified electrodes, in conjunction with solvent vapor annealing, yields excessively large ionic grains that compromise ionic conductivity. Overall, the judicious use of sequence-defined peptides adsorbed to electrode surfaces, or solvent vapor annealing, encourage the appropriate microstructures of thin-film AEIs resulting in ameliorated ionic conductivity.",

In this study, a facile and general approach to construct DDG is developed based on the near-infrared radiation (NIR)-driven responsive 2D ordered surface pattern, which is fabricated by light-direct writing of wrinkles on a thin film of a photosensitive supramolecular polymer network comprised of a copolymer containing amino groups, anthracene carboxylic acid (ANA), and carbon nanotubes. The resulting surface pattern, which exhibits a height dependence on the NIR irradiation, can be used as the DDG whose optical diffraction can be regulated in-situ by NIR. Furthermore, because of the presence of a reversible ANA photodimer and hydrogen bonding in the supramolecular network, the patterned surface can be erased and rewritten by UV light with different wavelengths and self-healed by NIR irradiation. The results demonstrate a simple strategy for DDGs that will have a broad application in the fields of optics, electronics, and intelligent sensing.",

    "abstract": "Connecting data science (machine learning) with experimental methods is critical for accelerating material science research. Herein, we report a multivariate analysis for exploring A-site organic cation mixing in tin iodide perovskite (ASnI3) solar cells (PSCs), which are the most suitable Pb-free PSC candidates. To address the common drawbacks of Sn perovskites (facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and large degree of mixing), we proposed an efficient experimental screening method using 133 types of environmentally stable A2Sn(IV)I6 zero-dimensional pseudoperovskites to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ASn(II)I3, in which A is a ternary or quaternary mixed organic cation (namely, metylammonium, formamidinium (FA), dimethylammonium, guanidinium, ethylammonium, acetamidinium, trimethylammonium, imidazolium, or phenylethylammonium (PEA)). The high correlation coefficient of our model (0.953) and experimental validation (0.982) allowed us to identify a new (FA0.92IM0.08)0.9PEA0.1SnI3 Sn-PSC with a PCE of 7.22%. Our results provide a basis for exploring A-site cation mixing in Sn-PSCs for improving their performance.",

    "abstract": "Organic–inorganic van der Waals heterojunctions present unique opportunities to explore novel applications of optoelectronic devices. However, ambipolar and wavelength-dependent phototransistors based on organic–inorganic heterojunctions have rarely been reported. Here, we focus on an organic–inorganic heterojunction comprised of a single crystal of 2,6-diphenyl anthracene (DPA) and a monolayer MoS2 film. Such DPA/MoS2 bilayer heterojunctions are fabricated by a mechanical transfer method and show ambipolar charge transport characteristics with hole and electron mobilities of 0.13 and 1.1 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. More interestingly, an anomalous wavelength-dependent source–drain current (IDS) decrease is unexpectedly observed in the operation of heterojunction based phototransistors. Mechanism studies propose that a large interface in the bilayer structure and unique band alignment of the two components facilitate accumulation and recombination of the carriers. Due to the different optical absorption ranges of the two components, electrons (holes) inject in DPA (MoS2) under irradiation of 365 nm, while only electrons inject from MoS2 to DPA under 550 nm; thus, carriers quenched under different irradiations lead to the wavelength selected IDS decrease. Taken together, such organic–inorganic heterojunctions demonstrate potential applications for next-generation high-performance phototransistors, photodetectors, and complementary logic circuits.",

The low intrinsic enhancement limits the application in trace detection, remaining a challenging issue to regulate both dipole–dipole interaction and charge transfer resonance. Herein, we developed an ultrafast low-energy ion sputtering method to controllably modify 2D substrate which pronouncedly enhances the charge transfer. The enhancement factor of Ti-modified monolayer MoS2 reaches 2.67 × 108 and detection limit is 10–10 M. We further demonstrated the universality by modifying other plasmon-free metals and using MoSe2 as a substrate. The enhancement mechanism was investigated by the density functional theory calculation, indicating a charge transfer between dye molecules and substrate enhanced by new states in the bandgap from Ti clusters. It is believed that this new strategy gives rise to the remarkable feasibility for fabricating metal clusters and improves the chemical mechanism enhancement.",

    "abstract": "It is still a challenge to optimize the tumor therapeutic efficacy via overcoming poor penetration and enhancing accumulation of nanomedicines simultaneously. Here, we developed a near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered disintegratable delivery system (Lipo@ICG@CuS) composed of thermosensitive liposome, photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG), and ultrasmall copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs), where ICG was embedded in the lipid bilayer and CuS NPs were encapsulated into the cavity of the liposome, respectively. Upon being irradiated by an 808 nm NIR laser, the local temperature of Lipo@ICG@CuS NPs is increased significantly, because of the photothermal capability of the loaded CuS NPs, and subsequently induces the structural collapse of thermosensitive liposomes to release the ICG and CuS NPs. The in vitro and in vivo results indicated that the as-prepared Lipo@ICG@CuS NPs could considerably prompt the CuS NPs to penetrate and accumulate deeply in tumors and obtained distinguished antitumor efficacy by combinatorial photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). The current study provides a new strategy for solving the inherent dilemma of the long blood circulation but poor penetration and accumulation of large-sized NPs, as well as the deep penetration but easy clearance of small-sized NPs during the tumor therapy of nanomedicines.",

Here, we present an organic-free synthesis of FAU-type zeolite with Si/Al = 3.4 using zinc oxide as a modifier. A combination of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques confirms that ZnO is well-distributed within zeolite pores as extra-framework species, and the nature of these species differs from bulk ZnO and framework zinc in Zn-FAU crystals. We demonstrate that the increased Si/Al ratio leads to improved hydrothermal stability, while catalytic cracking of 1-hexene and cumene show that ZnO-FAU exhibits a significantly longer lifetime compared to in-house and commercial zeolite Y. Collectively, this study presents a facile and efficient method to prepare more siliceous FAU with enhanced catalytic performance.",

The inherent pores of a well-designed system could be capable of molecular recognition thus combining the material advantages of both liquid and solid phases. Indeed, solid porous systems can have shape and size selectivity toward different gas moieties gas, but the liquid's ease of use with facile transportation and processing provide significant opportunities. A liquid passes over surfaces to generate a thin film, and even the rapid mass transfer and fluidity of liquids may give porous liquids rapid gas solubility and diffusion. Nowadays, improving existing technologies for gas capture is crucial for an application like pollution removal, storage, or catalysis. Many of these technologies used in these applications rely on the porosity of solids like zeolites or more nascent materials such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). In this work, we examine the suitability of 60 various solvents for use in Type II/III porous liquids by looking at their respective molecular dimensions and shape. Six rapid screening modeling methodologies to assess the various dimensions of the solvent molecules have been assessed. Several assessments are performed between solvents, gases, and MOFs' properties to support the design and generation of novel porous liquids.",

In this context, the present study explores the fabrication of plasma-derived fibrin hydrogels containing bactericidal hybrids based on graphene oxide (GO). The hydrogels were fully characterized regarding gelation kinetics, mechanical properties, and internal hydrogel structures by disruptive cryo scanning electron microscopies (cryo-SEMs). The gelation kinetic experiments revealed an acceleration of the gel formation when GO was added to the hydrogels in a concentration of up to 0.2 mg/mL. The cryo-SEM studies showed up a decrease of the pore size when GO was added to the network, which agreed with a faster area contraction and a higher compression modulus of the hydrogels that contained GO, pointing out the critical structural role of the nanomaterial. Afterward, to study the bactericidal ability of the gels, GO was used as a carrier, loading streptomycin (STREP) on its surface. The loading content of the drug to form the hybrid (GO/STREP) resulted in 50.2% ± 4.7%, and the presence of the antibiotic was also demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, Z-potential studies, and thermogravimetric analyses. The fibrin-derived hydrogels containing GO/STREP showed a dose-response behavior according to the bactericidal hybrid concentration and allowed a sustained release of the antibiotic at a programmed rate, leading to drug delivery over a prolonged period of time.",

In this regard, we developed the vertical alignment of the MoSe2 (v-MoSe2) layer by a plasma-assisted chemical vapor reaction to prevent the overmigration of the Cu species. With the insertion of the v-MoSe2 layer, the Cu/v-MoSe2/TiO2/Pt device shows a Forming-free characteristic and low-operation voltage range, avoiding the overinjection of the Cu species and hard breakdown of the device. Besides, the identical pulse scheme was applied to characterize the synaptic function of devices, with which the improved endurance and the enhanced linearity of the resistance change during potentiation and depression can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "An ideal nanoscale interpenetrating network morphology that is formed spontaneously upon a prepared active layer film is the key to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Here, a new strategy is described for optimization of morphology by enhancing polymer solution aggregation ability to effectively improve device performance. Polymers PBDQx-Cl, PBDQx-TCl, and PBDQx-2TCl were designed and synthesized systematically by tuning the polymer backbones. Structural manipulation has been found to have a profound effect on the regulation of electronic structure and solution aggregation behavior. Compared with PBDQx-Cl and PBDQx-TCl, PBDQx-2TCl exhibits enhanced solution aggregation ability and contributes to a fibrous phase separation in primitive pure film morphology. After blending with BTP-eC9, evolution of a nanoscale fibrillization interpenetrating network morphology is gradually demonstrated, in which the phase separation and microstructure form are collectively refined, which can provide more interface regions and charge transport channels. The resulting PBDQx-2TCl:BTP-eC9 micromorphologically meets the requirements for efficient exciton splitting, charge transfer, and decreased recombination loss. Thus, among the three polymers, the device based on PBDQx-2TCl:BTP-eC9 shows the highest PCE of 16.17% with superior JSC of 26.49 mA cm–2 and FF of 74.28%. These results demonstrate that the well-refined fibrillar network morphology can be achieved by adjusting the aggregation ability of a polymer solution. This in turn promotes a deeper understanding of the relationships between micromorphology and solution aggregation behavior.",

The shaped fuels are made by simply loading high-energy chemicals in solid gels with well-defined shapes. The loaded fuels can diffuse out and generate gradients in the vicinity of the solid gels, thereby driving transient assembly of supramolecular hydrogels that inherit the shapes of the solid gels. The macroscopic structures and lifetimes of the hydrogels can be tuned by changing the shapes and contents of the fuels, respectively. Such a shaped fueling dynamic self-assembly strategy is further designed for dynamic information encryption, whereby the encoded information can only be read for one time and within a defined period.",

    "abstract": "Significant improvements in experimental efficiency are required to explore new lithium-ion-conducting materials. Autonomous research based on robotic experiments exploring a vast chemical space is expected to resolve this problem. This study demonstrates the autonomous exploration of inorganic films with improved lithium ionic conductivity. The system successfully generated a phase diagram and found a new amorphous Li-ion conductor, Li1.8Al0.03Ge0.05PO3.3, exhibiting lithium ionic conductivity of approximately 3.4 × 10–6 S cm–1 at room temperature, showing one order of magnitude higher conductivity than the starting material. Furthermore, we unexpectedly found a mixed conductor, Li0.81Al0.24Ge0.61PO4.2, which is an electrode material for lithium batteries. The exploration of a large chemical space using an autonomous system enables the discovery of unexpected new materials. We discuss the possibilities of using the autonomous system for further materials exploration.",

    "abstract": "Photoinduced power generation from solid/liquid heterojunctions is an environmentally friendly method to alleviate the energy crisis. However, the utilization of volatile and corrosive electrolytes weakens the stability of harvesting solar energy, and it is challenging to obtain flexibility because of the device architecture. This study reports the fabrication of a novel photo-to-electrical energy conversion device based on a TiO2/graphene/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composite film in water. Under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, an output voltage of 0.52 V and power density of 2.32 mW/m2 were generated. A stable output voltage of 1.53 V was achieved by connecting three generators in series. Moreover, the generator shows efficient and stable energy harvesting from sunlight outdoors. Based on the output behavior of the device, a working mechanism based on ultraviolet-light-induced radical recycling at the electrodes was proposed. This new photo-to-electrical energy conversion technology may provide a general approach to meet the energy requirements of electronic devices and a novel method for fabricating self-powered UV sensors.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer. Conventional therapies for TNBC are limited by several drawbacks, including poor therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects. In contrast, photothermal therapy (PTT) has shown advantages in the treatment of TNBC due to its ease of administration and safe profile. Vanadium carbide (V2C), a new type of two-dimensional nanomaterial used in biomedicine, has shown excellent photothermal conversion and drug-carrying properties and has proven to be safe owing to its biodegradable characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) was loaded onto V2C to prepare a new nanocomposite (V2C–Dox nanosheets). PTT with V2C–Dox induced localized therapeutic thermal effects and prompted drug release. V2C and V2C–Dox nanosheets alone were nontoxic to breast cancer cells. However, Dox, V2C+laser, and V2C–Dox+laser significantly inhibited the viability, clonogenic ability, and migration of breast cancer cells and induced their apoptosis, with V2C–Dox+laser having the strongest effect. In addition, combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses indicated that the amino acid biosynthesis pathway and the ferroptosis pathway resulting from the aberrant expression of SLC7A11, PED4D, and 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-uronium imidazoline may be involved in the antibreast cancer effects of V2C–Dox after irradiation. Experiments in a breast cancer xenograft model showed that V2C–Dox@Gel significantly inhibited tumor growth following irradiation without inducing toxic side effects. Therefore, V2C–Dox@Gel, as a novel, controllable nanodelivery system for combined PTT and chemotherapy, could synergistically improve therapeutic efficacy in TNBC without causing adverse effects. Thus, it has immense potential as a therapeutic agent for TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Developing nanostructures to drive the selective and durable electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) is highly desirable. Here, we propose that the desired catalytic materials should meet three requirements: (1) catalyst oxidation potential higher than alkyne reduction potential, (2) easy desorption of alkene and difficult formation of PdHx, and (3) higher energy barriers for H* self-coupling than H* adds to an alkyne molecule. Thus, Pd2N nanocubes with nitrogen-atom-modified Pd interstitial sites are designed and synthesized to achieve 95.7% alkyne conversion, 97.8% alkene selectivity, and 72.4% alkene FE. The catalyst can be used for 18-cycle measurements without performance decline. A mechanistic study shows that the high selectivity is due to the inhibited PdHx, the weakened alkene adsorption, and the increased energy barrier for alkene hydrogenation. The high energy barrier for H* coupling to release H2 leads to the high alkene FE. In addition, the potential-independent alkene selectivity enables Pd2N to fit the fluctuating voltage in a solar-powered system. Furthermore, Pd2N is suitable for other functionalized alkynes and deuterated alkyne semihydrogenation.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has led to the failure of traditional antibiotics, posing a serious threat to human life and health. Therefore, the development of novel antibacterial strategies is of great significance. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural phenolic compound with high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been reported as a potential antibacterial agent. However, its low bioavailability and rapid metabolism are major limitations of its in vivo application. Herein, we develop a highly sensitive, image-guided, pH-responsive targeted nanomaterial ZEI@GCS based on persistent luminescence nanoparticles. This nanosystem effectively improved the loading rate of EGCG and targeted the infection site, thereby enhancing EGCG bioavailability. Concurrently, this highly sensitive persistent luminescence imaging mode substantially enhances the antibacterial properties of the nanosystem, enabling the evaluation of the therapeutic outcome in mice. This platform not only effectively solves the problem of the low bioavailability of EGCG but also provides a novel method for the efficient sterilization and optimization of antibacterial treatment strategies in clinical settings.",

However, nonfused acceptors with varying molecular symmetries have rarely been explored, and their structure–property–performance relationship remains unclear. In this work, two nonfused acceptors, namely, DTBDT-4Cl and DTBTT-4Cl with different molecular shapes, were synthesized and systematically investigated. The asymmetric acceptor DTBTT-4Cl with a C-shape molecular backbone exhibits more compact π–π stacking and higher crystallinity than the centrosymmetric S-shape acceptor DTBDT-4Cl. Remarkably, a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.8% with a the open-circuit voltage (VOC) as high as 0.916 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.9 mA cm–2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.5% was achieved, which significantly surpasses 11.3% for the DTBDT-4Cl-based devices. The enhanced performance could primarily be attributed to the enhanced intermolecular interactions, improved charge transfer, and suppressed charge recombination. These findings underscore the importance of precise control of the molecular shape through rational molecular design represents an effective strategy for adjusting the miscibility and thus the photovoltaic performance of nonfused electron acceptor-based OSCs.",

    "abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) belong to a class of metal oxyanion clusters that hold enormous promise for a wide range of catalytic reactions, due to their structural diversity and the presence of redox-active metal centers and heteroatomic sites within the framework. In this study, we successfully determined the structures of the first cocrystallized ternary molybdenum oxo-sulfide clusters: Mo12NaO54P8C48H40, Mo12NaS2O52P8C48H40, and Mo12NaS6O48P8C48H40, which are abbreviated as Mo12, Mo12@S2, and Mo12@S6, respectively. Together, they are referred to as Mo12-TC. These clusters exhibit nearly identical exterior structures, making them indistinguishable, leading to their cocrystallization in a single unit cell with 50%, 25%, and 25% occupancy for Mo12, Mo12@S2, and Mo12@S6, respectively, and could not be separated easily. To confirm their molecular formulae and occupancy within a crystal, we conducted single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and high-resolution electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies. The clusters exhibit a dumbbell-like shape, with each terminal of the dumbbell comprising a hexagonal Mo6 basal plane shielded by multiple oxo, and oxosulfide moieties for Mo12 and Mo12@S2/Mo12@S6 clusters, respectively. Additionally, the clusters are protected by a ligand shell consisting of vertically aligned phenylphosphonic acid (PPA). Mo12-TC demonstrates promising activity for electrochemical hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Mo12-TC exhibits overpotentials of 0.262 and 0.413 V vs RHE to reach HER current densities (in H2SO4) of 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively, and overpotentials of 0.45 and 0.787 V vs RHE to reach OER current densities (in KOH) of 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively, stable up to 5000 cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate their electrocatalytic potential, revealing the presence of active sites within these molecular frameworks.",

The functional group in D-HLH can interact with FA+ and I– as well as Sn2+ in the precursor solution. These interactions not only affect the formation of tin perovskite film and favor the formation of thicker 2D phases but also decrease the defect density and suppress the nonradiative recombination. As a result, the efficiency of tin PSCs is significantly improved from 7.97 to 12.45%, and the stability of the device is also enhanced. This work provides a feasible strategy to regulate the low-dimensional phases in 2D–3D tin PSCs toward realizing high efficiency.",

This occurs when nanocrystals are transferred into chloroform after etching with hydrofluoric acid and then dispersed in neat dodecene. The presence of trace chloroform provides radicals that promote hydrosilylation without additional photoactivation. This reaction is size-dependent, and larger nanocrystals cannot be passivated at room temperature. The nanocrystals passivated at room temperature disperse in nonpolar solvents with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields similar to those of nanocrystals capped by conventional thermal hydrosilylation at high temperature.",

However, synthesizing highly monodisperse Ag2S CQDs has been challenging, because they readily fuse with each other. Here, we introduce a dual-ligand passivation approach for the synthesis of highly monodisperse Ag2S CQDs. Leveraging both oleic acid and oleylamine as coligands for surface passivation, we achieve enhanced confinement of CQD morphology and effectively prevent CQD fusion. This contrasts with conventional Ag2S CQDs prepared by using solely oleylamine ligands, which show a wide size distribution due to inter-CQD fusion. This enables the exhibition of an efficient photothermal conversion capability upon illumination with an 808 nm laser, causing a rapid increase of temperature from 25 to 70 °C within 3 min. We demonstrate that incubation with 500 nM CQDs results in nearly 100% death of MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer cells) after just 5 min of 808 nm laser irradiation (1.5 W/cm2).",

In this study, this concept was used to construct highly active while metastable hcp-Co active phases for the Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) reaction. The formation of hcp-Co species was achieved by initially depositing wurtzite CoO on ZnO (ZnO@h-CoO), which exhibited only a lattice mismatch of 0.18%, followed by reduction with H2 to yield ZnO@hcp-Co. Experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that ZnO can decrease the surface energy of h-CoO through a strong interface bond. In situ XRD performed under H2 conditions confirms that ZnO@h-CoO is a viable precursor for the hcp-Co active phase in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, particularly when the reduction temperature is below 400 °C. The ZnO@h-CoO catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared with impregnated Co/ZnO catalysts due to the presence of hcp-Co sites. This work provides comprehensive insights into the phase transition process of metastable h-CoO, under various atmospheres and temperatures, presenting a practical approach for acquiring the hcp-Co active phase in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.",

It was recently realized that water vapor can play important roles in the growth of MX2 by reacting with MX2 at high temperature to form volatile metal oxyhydroxide (MOx(OH)y) and hydrogen chalcogenides (H2X) that dramatically change the growth processes. Here we report the controllable synthesis of WS2, MoS2, and their heterostructures using water-assisted chemical vapor transport (CVT). The water vapor can be tunably delivered by thermal dehydration of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) solid precursor, which not only provides a much lower vapor pressure baseline and a wider tunable range than liquid water but also can be readily integrated into a chemical vapor deposition process. This allows controlled growth of monolayer, multilayer, and spiral nanoplates of WS2, as well as the lateral epitaxial growth on the edge of MX2, and more reproducible growth of large area WS2–MoS2 heterostructures. Raman and photoluminescence spectral mappings confirm the various types of WS2–MoS2 heterostructures. These results reveal insights into the growth mechanisms of MX2 and provide a general approach to the controllable growth of other metal chalcogenides.",

First, a two-layered laminated polymer membrane that is self-supporting is prepared, and solid–solid interfacial polycondensation is performed. The insoluble three-dimensional (3D) network polymer layer formed is isolated by removing the soluble unreacted polymer layers. Finally, a SCAT reaction is carried out by irradiation of visible light on the insoluble 3D membrane to produce a soluble 2D macromolecular sheet. The precise 2D molecular structure can be displayed, such as the degree of polymerization, thickness, fraction of rings (pores), and pore size, estimated by GPC, AFM, 1H-NMR, IR, and XRD, because the macromolecule is soluble. Composite membranes containing the 2D macromolecular sheet show good oxygen permselectivity exceeding the Robeson upper line, possibly because the angstrom-sized pores and thicknesses produce high oxygen permselectivity without suppressing the permeability.",

After the planar π-conjugated building blocks, the steric bulky molecules with a three-dimensional (3D) framework enable the multiscale self-assembly architectures and superior charge storage properties, as well as high-performance optoelectronic applications, such as organic transistor memory, organic light-emitting diodes, organic lasers and organic photovoltaic cells. However, this type of 3D steric bulky molecule-based OSNCs are not easily to get, and molecular design principles must be developed. In this Review, recent advances in the efficient theories that have arose in building varied nanoarchitectures of 3D steric bulky molecule-based OSNCs, especially the 2D and 3D in morphology, are highlighted. The obtained steric OSNCs exhibited rich optoelectronic properties, including the charge storage, ion transmission, crystallization-enhanced emission, and so on. Further architectural optimization of the steric OSNCs to cater for optoelectronic device based on them is necessary to strive to develop this research direction.",

The generation of reactive oxygen species from both \"free\" c-OPE delivered from the coated wipe and undelivered OPE is proposed to be the antibacterial mechanism. The c-OPE coated wipe also exhibited an appreciable inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, where a total inactivation was achieved in 20–30 min light-activation.

Traditional layer or bulk heterojunction can enhance the photodoping of PSCs but suffers from a trade-off in balancing photocarrier generation and charge transport. Herein, we report on a hierarchical heterojunction comprising a bulk heterojunction photoactive layer and a separate charge transport layer, fabricated by using a simple orthogonal solvent method. The well-designed interfacial energy-level alignment of the hierarchical heterojunction contributes to efficient exciton separation and charge transfer into the charge transport layer, thus resulting in improved photodetection and photothermoelectric conversion. The photodetector exhibits photosensitivity and photoresponsivity of up to 1.1 × 107 and 9.2 × 106 A W–1, respectively, while the photothermoelectric device displays a maximum power factor of 13.7 μW m–1 K–2.

    "abstract": "The development of promising organic semiconductors showing very high mobility has been one of the key issues in the organic electronics. Although the last two decades have witnessed superior organic semiconductors showing mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V–1 s–1, it is believed that organic semiconductors showing bandlike carrier transport are promising for achieving very high mobilities (>10 cm2 V–1 s–1). In the present work, we take two regioisomeric diphenyl derivatives of dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes (DNTTs), i.e., 2,9- and 3,10-diphenyl-DNTT (2,9-DPh-DNTT and 3,10-DPh-DNTT, respectively), which have been reported to show thin-film mobilities on the order of 1 cm2 V–1 s–1, to compare the effects of dynamic disorder estimated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and intrinsic mobility evaluated by single-crystal field-effect transistors (SC-FETs). Although they were similar to each other in terms of mobility reported on thin-film FETs and the static electronic structures described by the hopping model, the present approach with MD simulations and SC-FETs highlights the characteristic differences between the regioisomers; the electronic structure of 2,9-DPh-DNTT in the solid state is not significantly thermally influenced, whereas for 3,10-DPh-DNTT the intermolecular transfer integrals are markedly affected by thermal agitation, implying that the latter is susceptible to dynamic disorder. Furthermore, 2,9-DPh-DNTT-based SC-FETs showed not only a very high mobility of 14 cm2 V–1 s–1 (on average) but also a bandlike temperature dependence of the mobility, which contrasts sharply with the moderately high mobility of 3,10-DPh-DNTT (6 cm2 V–1 s–1 on average) and temperature-independent transport behavior. We can say that the present approach of combining MD simulations and SC-FETs can be an effective way to find promising organic semiconductors that potentially show bandlike transport, that is, a path to “ultrahigh-mobility” organic semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "Depression is the most common psychiatric disease characterized by a persistently depressed mood. In patients with major depression, neuroplastic impairments are often observed. The failure rates of antidepressants exceed 30% due to treatment resistance, severe side effects, or prolonged onset of action. There is an absence of fast-acting antidepressants with good biocompatibility. Tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (TFNA), a novel DNA nanodevice, is expected to have extensive application value. Previously, work has examined the biological effect of TFNA on multiple cells types, and TFNA played active roles in neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory. To explore a new research direction for neuroplasticity and a potential mechanism for depression remedies, we tried to define the effects of TFNA on neuroplasticity. The results in vitro showed that TFNA alleviated cytotoxicity and disinhibited proliferation inhibition induced by corticosterone (CORT). In histological studies and behavioral tests, TFNA reduced synapse loss, improved neuronal atrophy, and increased cell number/vitality, thus resulting in improved depression-like behaviors in CORT-induced mice models in the early stages without a toxic effect. Proteins associated with synapse formation and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways were also explored to confirm these findings further. Overall, this work demonstrated the positive neuroplastic and therapeutic potential of TFNA for depression.",

We demonstrate multilayer TMD (such as MoS2 and WS2) nanoscrolls with a preserved direct band gap fabricated by an effective and facile method of solvent-driven self-assembly. The resultant multilayer nanoscrolls, exhibiting up to 11 times higher PL intensity than the remanent monolayer, are carefully characterized using PL spectroscopy. Significantly enlarged interlayer distances and modulated interlayer coupling in the fabricated nanostructures are unveiled by cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The preservation of direct band gap features is further evidenced by density functional theory calculations using the simplified bilayer model with an experimentally obtained 15 Å interlayer distance. The modulation of the PL intensity as an indicator of the band gap crossover in the TMD nanoscrolls is demonstrated by removing the acetone molecules trapped inside the interlayer space. The general applicability of the method presents an opportunity for large-scale fabrication of a plethora of multilayer TMD nanoscrolls with direct band gaps.",

Here, we report the design and synthesis of two model compounds featuring intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed between a center diazaisoindigo unit (the acceptor) and flanking indole units (the donor). Computational and experimental investigations show that these hydrogen bonds enthalpically stabilize the coplanar molecular conformation by >10 kcal/mol. The formation of these hydrogen bonds is also slightly favorable in terms of entropy, ensuring the high-temperature stability of the planar conformation. Thermal annealing of thin films of these compounds imparts high crystallinity and orientation in the solid state, while the non-hydrogen bond control only gave an amorphous solid. Field-effect transistor devices fabricated from these thin films exhibit hole mobilities up to 0.270 cm2 V–1 s–1, in contrast to the lack of measurable charge carrier mobility for the non-hydrogen bond control. This work demonstrates an efficient synthetic strategy to incorporate robust intramolecular hydrogen bonds into conjugated π-systems and elucidates the mechanism on how such hydrogen bonds promote the desired molecular conformation, solid-state packing, and electronic performances of conjugated organic materials.",

    "abstract": "The newly introduced conductive rhenium oxide–polytetrahydrofuran (ReOx–PTHF) exhibits high electrical conductivity (6.4 S/cm) and autonomous self-healing properties. ReOx–PTHF can be easily synthesized by dissolving Re2O7 in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent and waiting for over 24 h without further treatment. The synthesized ReOx–PTHF can be prepared as a gummy lump and thin film. Both mechanically cut ReOx–PTHF chunks and thin films can be successfully self-healed, and their electrical conductivity recovered after self-healing, although conventional PTHF does not exhibit electrical conductivity and self-healing properties at all. Ion–dipole and coordinative interactions by the ReO4– and ReO3 particles in the ReOx–PTHF significantly contribute to their self-healing properties and enhance the electrical conductivity of PTHF. Thus, ReOx–PTHF can be applied to self-repairing electronic circuits on the macroscale and microscale. Significantly, the self-healing properties and high electrical conductivity of ReOx–PTHF prevent severe loss of electrical conductivity of the thin metal film in flexible devices by mechanical strain when this polymer is simply spin-coated on the flexible electrodes. Thus, ReOx–PTHF-coated flexible electrodes show excellent capability as resilient flexible electrodes, which can retain their original electrical conductivity even after 10 000 bending cycles. Further, the ReOx–PTHF is not swellable and decomposable in aqueous media, sweat-like saltwater, and after it was exposed for over a month under ambient conditions. Therefore, ReOx–PTHF is a promising material as a resilient electrode in flexible and wearable electronics.",

Among the electrolytes studied, the 12-crown-4 (12C4)-based porous liquid electrolyte exhibited the most enhanced ionic conductivity due to size match between the crown ether cavity and the Li+ ion. Nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared analyses revealed that addition of crown ethers reduces the Li+ ion–solvent interaction, resulting in the formation of Li-crown ether complexes. Molecular simulations complement such observations by describing the detailed solvation environment at molecular scale, including complexation between Li+ and Mg2+ ions and 12C4. The strategy described here using crown ether-based porous liquids should be applicable to design versatile electrolytes for various metal-ion batteries.",

Stimulation of anabolism and ensuing decreased energy levels in cancer cells are central to tumor-selective autophagy induction. Herein, we present black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) with red blood cell membranes (RBCMs) cloaking (BPQDs@RBCMs) as activators of tumor anabolism for tumor-specific autophagy activation. The selective degradation of BPQDs@RBCMs releasing phosphate in the tumor microenvironment initiates autophagy by falling energy levels. In vivo assessments confirm that the BPQDs@RBCMs treatment effectively reduces overall tumor burden and alters metabolite profiles in tumor.

Herein, we employ density functional theory to investigate the performance of Cu single-atom catalysts supported on black phosphorus (Cu@BP). Despite exhibiting high stability, Cu@BP demonstrates comparable or even inferior discharge activity compared to pure BP when Cu atoms directly interact with sulfur species. Only when Cu atoms are located at the opposite side of the BP monolayer (CuO@BP), indirectly modulating the conversion of sulfur species, would the discharge activity be boosted. Specifically, CuO@BP displays a small free energy change of the rate-determining step (−0.04 or −0.03 eV) during discharge and a low decomposition barrier of *Li2S (0.56 eV) during charge. The underlying mechanism behind this indirect modulation of Cu atoms is adequately examined through electronic structure analysis. This work highlights CuO@BP as a promising candidate for Li–S batteries and encourages deeper exploration of catalyst design in achieving improved battery performance.",

    "abstract": "Zinc-based aqueous energy storage technology has sparked widespread interest because of its low cost, high energy density, high safety, and environmentally benign manufacturing process. However, progress has been severely impeded by H2 evolution and Zn dendrite formation. Interfacial engineering is a promising avenue for addressing these issues. Herein, molecularly thin Ti0.87O2 nanosheets were deposited on a Zn electrode surface via spin coating to form a monolayer film with a thickness of ∼1 nm. The electrode surface was fully covered with neatly tiled Ti0.87O2 nanosheets and thus effectively suppressed the H2 evolution side reaction and reduced the Zn nucleation potential, resulting in uniform electrochemical deposition and reversible plating/stripping of Zn. As a consequence, the cycle life was drastically improved from 105 to over 1400 h at 1 mA cm–2/1 mAh cm–2. This study has established an economical and efficient molecular-scale interfacial engineering strategy enabling practical applications of Zn metal electrodes, and it also shows great promise for use with other metal electrodes in Li, Na, Al, and Mg metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are currently used as conductive additives for the electrodes to enhance the capacity of the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and we herein for the first time demonstrate the feasibility of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) as an electrolyte additive for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The 0.9 wt % BNNT electrolyte yielded enhanced Li-ion conductivity up to 30% (∼0.87 mS/cm) and a much higher Li-ion transference number (∼0.73) compared to electrolytes without BNNT. The BNNT dispersed electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate) prepared via sonication serves as a new electrolyte formulation, together with the NCM622//graphite full cell, and exhibits the highest reversible capacities of 153 mAh/g at 1 C and excellent cyclic retention over 500 cycles at high 10 C with a specific capacity of 71.5 mAh/g and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% compared to 125.3 mAh/g at 1 C and 40 mAh/g at 10 C with only 97.5% Coulombic efficiency without BNNT, respectively. Overall, we suggest BNNT as a new class of functional electrolyte material that resolves the major limitations of conventional carbonate-based electrolytes and is compatible for different electrolytes/electrode materials aimed at practical implementations for current as well as advanced LIBs.",

Starting with nanorods of copper sulfide (Cu1.8S), we synthesized ZnS–CdS, CdS–ZnS–CdS, and ZnS–CdS–ZnS nanorods. Illumination with a blue LED light initiated the photodeposition of Au nanoparticles selectively onto the CdS regions. Subsequent cation exchange reactions transformed the CdS regions to Cu1.8S and then to ZnS while also facilitating surface diffusion and migration of the photodeposited Au, which coalesced into single particles through a surface ripening process. This process produced nanorods that were fully ZnS but with Au nanoparticles anchored in distinct regions. The Au–ZnS–Au sample exhibited a red shift of the plasmon peak relative to Au–ZnS, due to plasmonic coupling of the Au particles on the ZnS nanorod support.",

Here, we report the first photoresponsive supramolecular framework (NUT-103) via hierarchical self-assembly of zirconium metal–organic cages containing trinuclear zirconium clusters and azobenzene-functionalized ligands. NUT-103 displays permanent porosity and reversible photoresponsive properties. Photoregulating adsorption of CO2 was realized for NUT-103 and the regulation efficiency can reach 55%, while that of CH4 and N2 is only 7% and 3%, respectively. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the photoregulation property of NUT-103 is attributed to the variation of adsorption capacity in the interstitial region of adjacent cages. Moreover, NUT-103 can be dissolved to form discrete metal–organic cages and can be recovered by simple recrystallization. The recovered NUT-103 displays similar adsorption and photoresponsive behavior as the fresh sample.",

    "abstract": "While activated carbons derived from biomass resources have led to a notable enhancement in the performance of electrochemical energy storage systems, the presence of limited active sites resulting from randomly developed pores and relatively low electrical conductivity remains to be addressed. Herein we introduce a simple and cost-effective approach to generate a graphene-nanoplatelet-based structure with a large specific surface area, with prominent development of ultra-nanopores smaller than 3 nm. The electrochemical characteristics of the nanoplatelet structure were evaluated as active materials in an electrochemical double layer capacitor. To create a monolithic structure primarily composed of cellulose, we subjected balsa wood to delignification. The resulting cellulose-based monolith was subsequently subjected to carbonization and activation at various temperatures by using a chemical agent (potassium hydroxide). Structural analyses of the prepared materials revealed a high density of micro/nanopores within nanoplatelet-shaped two-dimensional particles. Especially, the Act. 900 sample (900 °C activation temperature) exhibited a large specific surface area of 1384 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.602 cm3/g with a large number of ultra-nanopores (<2 nm). Furthermore, the Act. 900-based electrode exhibited significantly enhanced capacitance (209.2 F/g), a capacitance retention of 96% at a scan rate of 300 mV/s, and cycling stability of 98% without discernible fading or decaying in capacitance after 10,000 testing cycles. This improvement in electrochemical performance can be attributed to ultra-nanopore formation in the graphene nanoplatelets and diffusion length optimization. These factors enable faster ion access and a greater number of electron pathways, thus enhancing performance. Our approach has potential applications in sustainable energy storage systems, making it feasible for practical implementation.",

One challenge for this compound is that the semiconducting perovskite phase is not stable at room temperature, when it tends to form a yellow nonperovskite phase with a bandgap of approximately 2.8 eV. Therefore, many reports have been focused on the stabilization of the CsPbI3 black perovskite phase through the use of additives during solution processing. Vacuum deposited CsPbI3 has been seldom reported, as in this case, the insertion of stabilizing agents is more challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the vacuum processing of CsPbI3 perovskite films at room temperature, obtained by incorporating dimethylammonium iodide by cosublimation with CsI and PbI2. As-prepared films were applied in planar solar cells, leading to an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 12%. In order to improve the device performance, we introduced a third A-site cation (methylammonium) in a four-source deposition process. This pure iodide formulation can be used in wide bandgap solar cells with a PCE up to 14.8%.",

    "abstract": "Nucleases are widely used tools for cleaving phosphodiester bonds in DNA in molecular biology research, medical diagnosis, and disease treatment. However, their inherently fragile nature limits their practical applications. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as solid supports for enzyme immobilization. But, the immobilized enzymes usually exhibit low catalytic activity and low enzyme availability. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we developed a self-activated nuclease formulation based on squaric acid-based MOFs for efficient enzyme activation and protection from harsh environments. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and its cofactors (Ca2+ and Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+) were encapsulated in a suitable MOF via a water-based de novo approach. These MOF carriers improved the stability of DNase I against perturbation environments (heating, treatment with an organic solvent, vortexing, and freeze–thawing) and released the enzymes and their cofactors during catalysis, enabling the conversion of the enzyme from its inactive to active form. Moreover, the squarate ligands disintegrated from the MOFs can serve as metal chelators, protecting DNase I from the inhibitory effects of Na+ and K+. This multifunctional nuclease formulation combines enzyme protection, self-activation, and customized catalysis. This formulation was also applied to other nucleases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II), which exhibited enhanced activity and stabilities. This study opens a new avenue for the facile preparation, storage, and transportation of nucleases, thus promoting their practical applications.",

Herein, we employ a microfluidic electrospray device to prepare the novel multifunctional discal microparticles (DMPs) with therapeutics encapsulation for wound healing. The DMPs are derived from the deformation of droplets containing κ-carrageenan and methacrylate-esterified hyaluronic acid. These DMPs possess highly porous structures due to the cross-linking and lyophilization of their hybrid hydrogels. Benefiting from the special discal morphology and porous structures, the DMPs offer candidates to wound dressing with large contact area and excellent drug release ability. By loading vascular endothelial growth factors and antimicrobial peptides, the resultant DMPs were imparted with good biocompatibility, sterilization, and angiogenesis in vitro. We have demonstrated that, in the skin defect model of Sjögren's syndrome mice, the multifunctional DMPs treated acute wounds could perform accelerated tissue regeneration and remodeling, down-regulated inflammatory response, and promoted angiogenesis in vivo. These results indicated that our proposed DMPs have great potential to serve as a satisfactory dressing for promoting wound healing.",

The properties of advanced click and bioorthogonal chemical tools have now exceeded the expectations set by the researchers who first introduced the two concepts, calling for reevaluation. More importantly, their developments in distinct research contexts have led to conceptual divergences, which can now be a source of misunderstandings and disagreements. This perspective article aims to take a fresh look at the two concepts, with particular attention to their combination for applications in biological environments. After a short historical introduction, the definitions of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry are revised, and the concept of ideal click chemistry is introduced. Chemical reactions that are commonly considered as click and bioorthogonal reactions are discussed in light of this new perspective. Finally, current challenges and new chemical concepts are presented, offering a new framework for future research.",

    "abstract": "Low electron conductivity and slow ion dynamics are the two key barriers limiting the use of transition-metal selenide (TMSe) anodes for high-power energy storage device applications. A rational structural design for TMSe can effectively promote the rapid transfer of Na+ on the surface and bulk phase. Presently, a cation-coupled MoSe2/FeSe/C heterostructure is developed by a facile two-step reaction and applied to sodium ion batteries/capacitors (SIBs/SICs). Wherein, a unique edge mixed phase (1T/2H-MoSe2) is generated under Fe induction. Additionally, the metal–organic framework-derived carbon guarantees structural stability and provides support for the rapid adsorption and transport of Na+ on the surface and bulk. Significantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the constructed MoSe2/FeSe heterogeneous interface has a strong metallic property that can facilitate the rapid transfer of electrons and ions within the bulk phase. As a result, the prepared MoSe2/FeSe/C can deliver a high specific capacity of 597.2 mA h g–1 (after 1000 cycles) at a current density of 2 A g–1 when applied as the anode of SIBs. Impressively, 3000 cycles can be stabilized, even at a high current density of 10 A g–1. When applied to SIC anodes, a capacity retention of 80.4% can be achieved at 2 A g–1 after 8000 cycles. The strategy of combining cation-coupled induced phase transitions with heterostructure design can serve as a reference for exploring the potential of TMSe in high-power energy storage devices.",

    "abstract": "Crystallization of low-dimensional perovskites is a complex process that leads to multidimensional films comprising two-dimensional (2D), quasi-2D, and three-dimensional (3D) phases. Most quasi-2D perovskite films possess a regular gradient with 2D phases located at the bottom of the film and 3D phases at the top. Recently, multiple studies have reported reverse-graded perovskite films, where the location of the 2D and 3D structures is inverted. The underlying reasons for such a peculiar phase distribution are unclear. While crystallization of regular-graded quasi-2D perovskites has been described as starting with 3D phases from the liquid–air interface, the film formation of reverse-graded films has not been investigated yet. Here, we examine the impact of the alkyl chain length on the formation of regular- and reverse-graded perovskites using n-alkylammonium ions. We find that long alkyl chains reverse the phase distribution gradient. By combining photoluminescence spectroscopy with in situ optical absorption measurements, we demonstrate that crystallization starts at the liquid–N2 interface, though as 3D phases for short-chain n-alkylammonium ions and as quasi-2D phases for long chains. We link this behavior to enhanced van der Waals interactions between long-chain n-alkylammonium ions in polar solvents and their tendency to accumulate at the liquid–N2 interface, creating a concentration gradient along the film thickness.",

Crystals of Ni-PDA-COF were successfully synthesized with an average size of 10 μm, enabling atomic-resolution structural characterization by continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED).

    "abstract": "Although cisplatin has widely been used for treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), its anticancer effect remains unsatisfactory, due to the heavy resistance. In this study, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) was proposed to effectively regulate the intracellular energy metabolism of heat and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) to improve the efficacy of cisplatin in the treatment of TNBC. Crylic acid-caged 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNPA) was developed as a novel pro-uncoupler of OxPhos. By depletion of cysteine, 2,4-dinitrophenol is released to promote oxidation and inhibit phosphorylation, which results in the generation of heat rather than ATP. Importantly, the generated heat can increase cross-linking between cisplatin and DNA, while the reduction of ATP can downregulate DNA repair enzymes. Furthermore, the depletion of both cysteine and ATP inhibits glutathione (GSH) synthesis in TNBC cells, which alleviates the GSH-mediated inactivation of cisplatin and disrupts the redox microenvironment, thereby promoting ferroptosis and apoptosis.",

The incorporation of GeI2 enhanced the performance of GeI2-doped SnPb PSCs with the highest efficiency of 21.9%. The XPS depth profiling showed unique observation; the Ge layer was only formed on the surface of the SnPb films. This layer encapsulated the SnPb films and thus prevented the perovskite films from extreme oxidation and structural and morphological degradations. An interlayer engineering approach was adopted in order to prove the PSCs by employing MeO2PACz monolayer as the hole extraction layer, while the tin oxide (SnOx) layer fabricated via atomic layer deposition (ALD) was applied near the electron transport layer. More than 94% of the initial efficiency was retained after 1000 h of a thermal stability test conducted at 85 °C in nitrogen atmosphere in the champion device.",

However, the current formulation of LNPs requires additional optimization for the improvement of antigen-specific immunity and the vaccination effect. The microbiome and its metabolites have shown beneficial effects on the host immune systems, especially on the induction of antigen-specific T cells and the antibody response of B cells. Herein, microbiome-derived LNPs (mbm-LNPs) are developed via the incorporation of short-chain fatty acids, the microbiome metabolites, into LNPs. mbm-LNPs-mediated delivery of ovalbumin and COVID-19 spike mRNA significantly improves antigen-specific CD8+ T cell and B cell responses compared to the approved LNP formulation. In vivo study in a tumor model exhibits enhanced protective effects of mbm-LNP against the antigen-expressing tumor cells and generalizes the immune-improving effect of mbm-LNP on the various ionizable lipids. Conclusively, this study suggests that microbiome metabolites could be an adjuvant for improving antigen-specific adaptive immune responses of mRNA vaccines.",

Herein, we demonstrated that PD0166285 (PD), a dual-targeted inhibitor of WEE1 and PKMYT1, specifically activated DNA damage of TP53-mutant GBM cells for inducing a robust apoptotic effect. Suiting the remedy to the case, the injectable double-network hydrogels (DNHs) encapsulating PD were constructed on the basis of acid-sensitive Fe3+/tannic acid (TA) metal-phenolic networks (MPNs). Particularly, the incorporation of MPNs not only endowed PD-loaded hydrogels (PDNHs) with on-demand drug delivery but also controllably generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, ROS could amplify DNA damage stress, which demonstrated the potential of PDNHs as an activatable initiator to in situ trigger high-level DNA damage of TP53-mutant GBM cells. Thus, PDNHs remarkably restricted the postsurgical relapse of orthotopic GBM carrying TP53 mutations and improved the survival time of mice. This study presents a valuable strategy for suiting the remedy to postsurgical TP53-mutant GBM.",

The weak FLP in 2D MSJs allows their Fermi levels to be easily altered by the impact of the substrate materials. Therefore, utilizing substrates to improve the contact properties of 2D MSJs can be a feasible strategy. Herein, we systematically studied the effect of BN with a B or N vacancy on 2D MSJs. Due to interlayer charge transfer caused by atomic vacancies, the band-edge rigidly shifts, ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 eV. Transmission coefficient and IV curve indicate that the BN substrate indeed induces the transition from Schottky to Ohmic contact.

Several chemotherapeutic agents can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) to synergize with ICB, whereas abnormal redox homeostasis in a tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts the chemotherapy-induced ICD effect. Herein, we report a Cu-based ferroptosis amplifier (Cu-POX) for enhanced cancer immunotherapy by remodeling redox homeostasis and increasing ICD induction. In the TME, glutathione depletion triggers a series of responsive behaviors, resulting in the exaltation of oxidative stress and the induction of ferroptosis. More importantly, a powerful ICD cascade activates immunogenicity in the TME and in turn reinforces the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody (aPD-L1)-mediated ICB therapy. In tumor-bearing mouse models, Cu-POX synergized with ICB therapy exhibited a robust inhibitory effect of bilateral subcutaneous tumors and activated a long-term immune memory effect. This work shows a ferroptosis-amplifying system enhanced by cascade responses for cancer immunotherapy.",

Finite element simulations, validated on the outcome of a testing campaign performed on three-dimensional (3D)-printed elastomeric samples, are used to build a dataset for machine learning algorithm training. Different machine learning techniques are used to link the geometric features of the designed biomimetic structures to their energy absorption properties and, in particular, to the specific absorbed energy divided by the peak force, here used as the performance index.

In this study, given that the redox potentials of FeIII/FeII in MHCFs vary with different M cations, we aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of controlling the redox potentials of MHCF modifiers and polyoxometalate (POM) redox couples in promoting redox oxidation and the resultant hydrogen (H2) evolution.

Nevertheless, current MOCVD processes confront challenges associated with small domain sizes typically in the submicrometer range, leading to dense grain boundary defects that compromise the crystal quality of the MoS2 films. We herein present the MOCVD growth of large-size and single-crystal MoS2 monolayers using a quartz nozzle-guided precursor delivery approach. This growth method substantially reduces the nucleation density, enabling the formation of record-large MoS2 crystals (>300 μm) among all MOCVD results.

These materials, collectively called X-ides, are often considered promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, under the strongly oxidizing conditions of the OER, transition metal X-ides often act as precatalysts, undergoing in situ reconstruction to a different, catalytically active phase. Discrepancies exist in the literature, with some studies claiming the absence of such transformations. Building upon previous efforts to elucidate catalytic performance trends in the community, this Perspective discusses a more nuanced approach to X-ide research, emphasizing the need to reassess our understanding of their chemical stability and the significance of the in situ reconstruction process. By discussing the role of experimental and computational databases, we present strategies for predicting X-ide stability and stress the importance of thorough experimental validation. Moreover, we highlight the use of machine learning to extract meaningful insights from these data and urge the community to adopt a standardized, systematic reporting of X-ide performance. Finally, we provide strategic guidelines and directions to advance transition metal X-ide research, ultimately enhancing their future application for a sustainable hydrogen economy.",

Specifically, we synthesized five distinct copper-based macrocycles that differ in either the steric bulk, polarity, or hydrogen-bonding ability of the peripheral side chains. We show that the electrical conductivity of these macrocycles is highly sensitive to steric bulk, decreasing by 3 orders of magnitude upon introduction of peripheral neopentyl substituents. We further show that the introduction of hydrogen-bonding groups leads to more ordered packing and a dramatic increase in crystallite size. Together, these results establish side-chain engineering as a rich toolkit for controlling the packing structure, particle morphology, and bulk properties of conjugated metal–organic macrocycles.",

The R/S system achieves an enhanced structural asymmetry, marked by a significant Pb–I–Pb bond angle disparity (Δβ = 9.24°), attributed to the distinctive asymmetric templating effects from mixed cations with distinct molecular structures and opposite absolute configurations. Consequently, spin–orbit-coupled hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate a substantial spin splitting (ΔE = 78.5 meV), among the largest reported for PbI42–-based 2D HOIPs.

    "abstract": "Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, converting CO2 into high-value-added chemical products, is a key technology to realize a natural carbon cycle. As one of the most effective catalysts, oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) is widely used in CO2 reduction because of its ability to produce hydrocarbons. However, the atomic structure of Cu on the Cu2O surface and why such a structure shows more catalytic activity than directly synthesized Cu are still unknown. Here, by using stochastic surface walking global optimization combined with a global neural network potential (SSW-NN) method, we explore the phase diagram of CuxO, the possible atomic structure of the Cu2O/Cu interfaces, the Cu2O surface reduction, and the Cu catalytic performance. By continuously deleting a certain amount of O atoms to mimic the reduction process, we find that a metastable phase, namely hcp-Cu, is formed on the Cu2O (001) surface because of the good atomic position and lattice match between Cu2O (001) and hcp-Cu (110), rather than fcc-Cu (111). The total energy barrier for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is 1.40 eV on the hcp-Cu (110) surface, much lower than the 1.97 eV on the fcc-Cu (111) surface, indicating the excellent catalytic performance of hcp-Cu. This proposed in situ-formed hcp-Cu not only reconciles the longstanding debate regarding the high catalytic activity of OD-Cu but also guides the rational design of electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts via phase engineering.",

    "abstract": "Short peptides are attractive building blocks for the fabrication of self-assembled materials with significant biological, chemical, and physical properties. The microscopic and macroscopic properties of assemblies are usually closely related to the dimensionality of formed hydrogen bond networks. Here, two completely different supramolecular architectures connected by distinct hydrogen bond networks were obtained by simply adding a hydroxyl group to switch from cyclo-tryptophan-alanine (cyclo-WA) to cyclo-tryptophan-serine (cyclo-WS). While hydroxyl-bearing cyclo-WS molecules provided an additional hydrogen bond donor that links to adjacent molecules, forming a rigid three-dimensional network, cyclo-WA arranged into a water-mediated zipper-like structure with a softer two-dimensional layer template. This subtle alteration resulted in a 14-fold enhancement of Young's modulus values in cyclo-WS compared to cyclo-WA. Both cyclo-dipeptides exhibit biocompatibility, high fluorescence, and piezoelectricity. The demonstrated role of dimensionality of hydrogen bond networks opens new avenues for rational design of materials with precise morphologies and customizable properties for bioelectronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) has become a promising method for cancer treatment through photothermal ablation. Nevertheless, its efficacy is often compromised by the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the activation of inflammatory cascades. Herein, this study introduced a well-designed chemo- and photothermal nanoplatform (CI-NPs) by non-covalent self-assembly of curcumin (Cur, a multifunctional small molecule) and IR-1061 (a NIR II photothermal agent), without the help of excipients. The CI-NPs demonstrated uniformity in size, efficient photothermal conversion following 1064 nm irradiation, improved tumor penetration, and a combined chemo- and photothermal effect against 4T1 breast cancer. Importantly, Cur in CI-NPs reprogrammed the inflammatory microenvironment by reducing PTT-induced inflammatory cascades and downregulated the overexpressed HSP-70 to sensitize PTT. This enabled CI-NPs to significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study provides a promising self-assembly strategy that combines phototherapeutic technique with natural small molecules, offering great potential for enhanced cancer therapy.",

However, the nonluminescent nature of most MOFs hinders their potential as scintillators. Herein, we propose a general energy-puzzle strategy to convert nonluminous MOFs into efficient scintillators for X-ray detection. By doping a minute quantity of lanthanide (Ln) whose energy level matches that of the linker in the original MOF, the resulting Ln-doped MOF exhibited significantly enhanced X-ray excited luminescence (XEL) performance, boosting an extraordinary improvement exceeding 2 orders of magnitude in terms of limit of detection (LOD). Judicious selection of Ln-dopant with proper energy level enables broad applicability to generally improve the XEL performance of weakly or nonemissive MOFs, among which a rare X-ray-induced near-infrared scintillation was realized. This work broadens the material scope of MOF-based scintillators and facilitates the exploration of efficient MOF-based scintillators for potential radiation detection applications.",

However, current 2D polymers suffer from drawbacks of harsh preparation conditions, limited thermal/photostability, and poor structural diversity. In this work, the C–C-coupled 2D polymer 2D@COP-DBTS was synthesized via isopropanol-assisted exfoliation of the corresponding layerlike linear polymer. The obtained 2D@COP-DBTS demonstrates a competitive conversion of 60.8% in NADH regeneration. DFT calculations reveals that the photocatalyst has strong affinities to reactive substrates, guaranteeing quick electron transfer and prominent catalytic efficiency. When the in situ NADH regeneration is combined with formate dehydrogenase, an extremely high amount of formate (572.92 mmol, turnover frequency (TOF) of 63500 mmol gcat–1 h–1) is accumulated. In addition, 0.0351 mmol of l-glutamate (TOF of 0.488 mmol gcat–1 h–1) is also obtained in the 2D@COP-DBTS/glutamate dehydrogenase mixture, indicating high feasibility of formate and l-glutamate production in the polymer/enzyme-coupled system.",

The cellulose-based device effectively emulates the plasticity of biological synaptic connections and exhibits learning behavior under biograde voltage as low as 10 mV. Significantly, it demonstrates exceptional digital-to-analog conversion performance with a minimal power consumption of 0.1 nJ, facilitating efficient interface biological signal matching. Furthermore, a molecular-level model is introduced to elucidate the rotation of intramolecular polar bonds in cellulose induced by electrical stimulation. This rotation alters the material's relative dielectric constant, unveiling the digital-to-analog conversion ability and neuro-like behavior. The biocompatible cellulose-based device efficiently emulates synapses with its low-power signal conversion, holding promise for effective biological signal matching in brain–machine interfaces.",

In this work, a new dry-transfer method via an in situ vapor-deposited parylene film on MMCs was developed for fabricating flexible OFETs. The transferred MMCs retained an atomically flat surface and long-range ordering and exhibited a conformal and residue-free interface with the dielectric layer, thereby giving a high average mobility of 13.23 cm2 V–1 s–1 to the flexible OFETs.

To accelerate the design of new candidate IR polymers with enhanced LWIR optical transparency, we have developed a protocol that integrates density functional theory calculations for simulating IR spectra (including both frequencies and absorption intensities of the vibrations) with high-throughput screening. This approach enables us to explore novel hydrocarbon molecules with improved LWIR transmittance which retain reactive groups conducive to polymerization with sulfur. The aim is to incorporate novel candidate molecules with high predicted IR transparency into polymeric materials, namely chalcogenide hybrid sulfur polymers synthesized by the inverse vulcanization of elemental sulfur. Starting from a relatively large library of unsaturated 35,238 hydrocarbons, this study introduces a set of promising candidates whose high LWIR percent window transparency values (wT) and chemical structures are expected to produce novel transparent hybrid sulfur/organic plastic materials.",

By integrating inverse opal films into the chip, we achieved the real-time observation of the barrier function of glycocalyx in vitro. We demonstrated that the glycocalyx integrity and its barrier function can be maintained under physiological shear stress, and further, the restoration of glycocalyx treated with sevoflurane after being destroyed by low shear stress was also confirmed.

Nonetheless, their utilization in all-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) is largely constrained by the unclear metal–sulfur (M–S) interactions in the solid state. Herein, we suggest that the strength of the M–S bond formed between SACs and sulfur can be an indicator to evaluate the bidirectional catalytic ability of SACs. Single atomic sites that possess fewer occupied antibonding states bond the sulfur species robustly via enhanced d–p orbital hybridization, which effectively catalyze the redox reaction. However, the excessively strong M–S bond increases the risk of catalyst poisoning, owing to the solid-state interface characteristics. Among the prepared three SACs, CoNC featuring moderate M–S interactions displays superior rate and cycling performances. An initial capacity of 1151 mAh g–1 is achieved at 2C, with a capacity retention rate of up to 94.66% after 500 cycles.",

Administering Wnt5a-loaded proT-patch to skin enhanced Keratin-9 expression in basal epidermal keratinocytes compared to topical and unloaded controls.

    "abstract": "Sulfur mustard (HD) is a powerful vesicant that inflicts fatal damage to humans. However, limited by the temperature-induced detection mechanism, chemiresistive gas sensing of HD or its simulants with high sensitivity and superior selectivity at room temperature remains a huge challenge. Herein, we propose a surface modification strategy for orthorhombic WO3·H2O using the epitaxial growth of a 2D conjugated MOF (2D c-MOF) based on the hard–soft acid–base theory. The interfacial electron delocalization from WO3·H2O to a 2D c-MOF strengthens the coordination interaction between tungsten (W) and sulfur (S) at room temperature, thus boosting the overall electron delocalization from the mustard gas simulant (2-CEES) to the sensing materials. As a result, the fabricated devices realize room temperature detection of 2-CEES with an impressive detection limit (100 ppb), excellent anti-interference ability, fast response, and good stability. Strategies modifying metal oxide surfaces with 2D c-MOFs provide new ideas for improving room temperature sensing performance.",

    "abstract": "In the current state of organic semiconductor development, n-type semiconductors are significantly less advanced than their p-type counterparts, particularly in the realm of high-electron-mobility materials, which are crucial for high-grade organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) in commercial electronics. Over the past few years, the incorporation of B←N coordination units has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing n-type properties. However, the exploration of polymers with π-conjugated extensions in different directions has been largely overlooked. This study introduces two novel B←N coordinated BDP-based polymers, P1 and P2, synthesized with distinct π-conjugated extension directions: along the backbone and perpendicular to it, respectively. P1, with its advantages in energy levels, planarity, crystallinity, and backbone transport, demonstrates an electron mobility of 1.81 cm2 V–1 s–1, which is more than twice the performance of P2. This achievement sets a new benchmark for B←N coordinated n-type OFETs, marking one of the highest reported electron mobilities to date.",

    "abstract": "Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is a prevalent progressive hair loss condition. The main therapeutic drug, minoxidil, is limited by its poor efficacy and side effects such as contact dermatitis and hypertrichosis. Nitric oxide (NO), an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, promotes angiogenesis and accelerates blood flow, enhancing nutrient supply similar to minoxidil. Accordingly, we utilized a poly(vinyl alcohol) film (PVA) loaded with hyaluronic acid (HA) liposomes to construct a multistage transdermal NO delivery system (PVA@HL/NONOate) for the treatment of AGA. The HA liposomes provided efficient NO loading and extended release, while the PVA film improved skin penetration and sustained NO release, increasing NO bioavailability. Low-concentration NO effectively enhanced hair follicle vitality and repaired blood vessels. Mechanistically, low-concentration NO could treat AGA mainly by regulating the HIF-1 signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis, reducing inflammation by downregulating the expression of TNFRSF9 and IL-6, repairing hair follicles by downregulating the expression of genes in the CXCL5-IL-17 inflammatory axis.",

Here, a polymer is designed with pH-responsive properties under alkaline conditions and remains soluble in WiSE, which expands the electrochemical stability window of ALIBs. The polymer prevents water reduction and coprecipitates with the LiTFSI salt in alkaline conditions, resulting in the formation of a stable SEI layer. Moreover, this polymer promotes the crystallization of LiTFSI, leading to a change in the morphology of the SEI as observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.

The ternary CdS-T-C exhibits markedly enhanced activity toward visible light photoreforming of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) and H2 cooperatively, as compared to bare CdS and conventional CdS-Ti3C2Tx MXene (CdS-T) that suffer from serious MXene restacking with obvious electronic and optical property attenuation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CTAB interfacial intercalation alleviates the restacking of Ti3C2Tx, thus weakening the light shielding effect while promoting the charge transport and surface activity of MXene. This work demonstrates an appealing strategy to regulate the interfacial cross-coupling configuration of MXene-semiconductor composites for efficient solar-to-chemical conversion.",

Carboxyl and ester groups are commonly used for their strong binding with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions. However, the impact of additive acidity on the long-term stability of PSCs remains unclear. This study investigates the functional roles of 4-amino-3,5-difluorobenzoic acid (DFAB-A) and methyl 4-amino-3,5-difluorobenzoate (DFAB-AM), which could effectively passivate the film defects. However, the acidity resulting from carboxyl deprotonation in DFAB-A negatively impacts the structural stability of the perovskites. In contrast, DFAB-AM with its ester functionality forms stronger and more stable bonds, contributing to improved passivation and stability. PSCs incorporating DFAB-AM achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 22.51% and maintain 84.3% of their initial efficiency after 800 h of maximum-power-point operation. These findings underscore the importance of carbonyl group design in developing molecular additives to enhance both the efficiency and the durability of PSCs.",

We further reveal that while the spin polarization of the triplet state is slightly reduced compared to prototypical Anthracene:TCNB, the phase memory (Tm) and, for 9-acetylanthracene:TCNB spin–lattice relaxation (T1) time, could be enhanced up to 2.4 times.

In 8 ppm of uranium-containing wastewater, the Cu2O/CuO heterojunctions exhibited a remarkable uranium extraction efficiency of 94.6% within 10 min under irradiation, which exceeded most recently reported photocatalysts. The photocatalytic reaction rate constant of Cu2O/CuO heterojunctions was 5.8-time larger than that of pure Cu2O. A mechanism study indicated that the photogenerated electrons reduced CuO species in Cu2O/CuO heterojunctions and in situ created the oxygen vacancy during the photocatalysis process, which strengthened the binding of UO22+.

We have used operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction with a time resolution of 1.24 s to observe the structural changes that occur when the lithiation of graphite and LiFePO4 electrodes are interrupted. Assessing the kinetics of the relaxation processes coupled with molecular dynamics simulations allows us to identify three relaxation stages in graphite. The atomistic origin for the relaxation process within the partially lithiated graphite structure is driven by the reorganization of Li ions into Li clusters. Relaxation in LiFePO4 electrodes is considerably slower than for graphite, but the observed structural changes is also attributed to reorganization of Li ions. These insights highlight the nature of the structural changes that occur during relaxation and the importance of using operando structural studies to avoid misleading conclusions about the reaction mechanisms in battery materials.",

The addition of NMABr not only has a passivation effect but also changes the morphology of the Al2O3 layer. Under the synergistic effect of Al2O3 and NMABr, a porous insulating contact layer is better formed, which is conducive to carrier transport and improves the stability and efficiency.",

Furthermore, all MOFs achieve dynamic color-tuning LAL based on excitation wavelength and temperature. Photoluminescence properties and theoretical calculations indicate that the multicolor LAL arises from the emissions of FL and its aggregation state, while enhanced phosphorescence can be assigned to heavy-atom and interlocking effects, coordination, and noncovalent interactions.

    "abstract": "Perovskite oxides have exhibited promising catalytic performance in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and thermocatalysis, and the performance can be potentially enhanced by tuning their flexible electronic and crystal structure. The B cations play essential roles in altering the inherent electronic structure and catalytic activity of these perovskite and related layered perovskite oxides. In this work, we establish the relationship of composition (electronic structure) and activity/selectivity of layered perovskites for pure and B-site-substituted Sr2Sn1–xRuxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The isopropanol decomposition was chosen as the probe reaction because its divergent reaction pathways through either dehydration or dehydrogenation are sensitive to the solid-state properties of the metal oxide surface. Both parent layered perovskite oxides of Sr2SnO4 and Sr2RuO4 exhibited decent conversion (20%–30%) and selectivity (>80%) to acetone through dehydrogenation pathways over a temperature range of 280–320 °C under atmospheric pressure, while the substituted perovskites, even with 10 at. % substitution of Ru at the B-site showed remarkable enhancement for both activity and selectivity toward acetone. By varying the dopant concentration linearly, both activity and selectivity showed a volcano-shaped dependency on the atomic concentration of the substituent. Overall, the Sr2Sn0.3Ru0.7O4 had the best yield of acetone, which may be ascribed to the optimal eg filling state of the B site for appropriate B–O bond strength during oxygenate adsorption. The current research provides a guide to the rational design of perovskite oxide catalysts for efficient chemical transformation.",

The formed anionic poly(3-sulfopropyl acrylate) chains remain inside the pores even when the material is exposed to 1 M aq. salt solutions. After anionic polymer formation inside the pores, the QI network loses its overall ion exchange capacity, presumably because of complexation of the cationic matrix with the resident anionic polymer, and exhibits higher KCl sorption. However, the pore environment remains ionic, as confirmed by water and salt sorption measurements. Single-salt diffusion dialysis studies on supported QI thin film membranes containing the anionic polymer in the QI pores show that KCl permeates >70 and >150 times faster than K2SO4 at 0.05 and 0.5 M feed concentrations, respectively. In contrast, KCl permeates at the same or slower rate than K2SO4 through as-synthesized supported QI thin film membranes. The poly(3-sulfopropyl acrylate) formed inside the QI pores is likely responsible for these observed ion sorption and transport differences.",

The level of control over crystal nucleation and growth of guanine exhibited by these organisms to produce crystals with precise morphology, size, and polymorphism far surpasses what has so far been achieved synthetically from aqueous solution. Here, we show that the morphology of guanine crystals can be altered significantly by inducing crystallization at the air–water interface to produce vase-like morphologies with a few hundred nanometers thick, micron-longcrystals pointing away from the vase opening. The exact morphology is highly dependent on the initial guanine concentration with increasing templating efficiency from the air–water interface at decreasing sample volumes. Scanning nanobeam X-ray diffraction experiments reveal that the vases consist exclusively of the anhydrous β-polymorph and that the crystal long axes coincide with a*. While the morphology does not match the biogenic counterparts that usually are thin along a*, the results demonstrate that interfacial crystallization templates the aggregate morphology and dictates the polymorph of guanine.",

    "abstract": "Porous metal-organic frameworks have attracted tremendous research interest, because of the presence of tunable porous structures and site-isolated catalytic units. However, bottom-up on-surface synthesis of their inorganic counterparts, metal-inorganic frameworks (MIFs), is rarely demonstrated. Here, we report a facile epitaxial growth of one-dimensional (1D) porous metal-inorganic chains, gold–phosphorus chains (AuP chains), in which phosphorus magic clusters P4 are interconnected by Au atoms extracted from the underlying Au(110) surface. The atomic structure has been precisely revealed through the combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The growth process involves the formation of phosphorus dimers sitting at the bridge sites of the top rows of Au(110) (2 × 1) reconstructed surface at low coverage, followed by the etching of the phosphorus dimers and the transformation to 1D AuP chains with prolonged phosphorus deposition. Our findings provide a facile method for on-surface synthesis of 1D MIFs and pave the way for their potential applications in the future.",

High-performance memories that match the high-speed computing cell is needed, and architecture innovation is also urgent to solve the data transfer bottleneck of von Neumann architecture. Constructed by layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures can be easily stacked and own diverse physical properties and band structures that provide a large space for the memory devices design.

    "abstract": "Artificial heterojunctions formed by vertical stacking of dissimilar two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer materials in a chosen sequence hold tantalizing prospects for futuristic atomically thin circuits. The emergence of 2D topological insulators (TI), including Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, and Sb2Te3, represents a new class of 2D building blocks and can complement the existing artificial heterojunctions as a result of their intriguing surface states protected by the time-reversal symmetry. However, the determination of band alignments of such 2D TI/TMD vertical heterojunctions, the key parameter for designing HJ-based electronic/photonic devices, which lies in the development of epitaxy growth, remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate the epitaxy growth of 2D TI/TMD vertical heterojunctions comprised of Bi2Te3/WSe2 with atomically clean interfaces that are spectroscopically accessible, and theoretically tractable. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and the presence of interlayer-coupled characteristics from Raman spectroscopy collectively confirm the neat stacking of Bi2Te3/WSe2 with the absence of unwanted containments. Microbeam X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (μXPS) measurement coupled with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrical characteristics of field effect transistors quantitatively reveals the type-II alignment of vertically stacked of quintuple layers (QL) Bi2Te3/WSe2. Meanwhile, the type-III band emerges when transitioning to multi-quintuple layer (MQL) Bi2Te3/WSe2. The finding here provides a well-defined example of the epitaxy growth paradigm, the interlayer coupling-electronic properties relationship, for these emerging 2D TI/TMDs vertical heterojunctions.",

    "abstract": "In situ crystallization of perovskites provides a promising approach to achieve high-quality semiconductor films ideal for optoelectronic devices. However, understanding of the complicated in situ crystallization processes of perovskites is still limited. Here, we report that controlling the solvent-vapor atmosphere in the spin-coating step leads to two distinct in situ crystallization modes of the perovskite films. A pure nitrogen atmosphere causes fast evaporation of the solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and, in consequence, substrate-dependent crystallization processes. In contrast, an atmosphere with a controlled partial pressure of 15 Pa of DMSO slows down the evaporation rates, resulting in substrate-independent crystallization processes. The two in situ crystallization modes generate films of perovskite nanoplatelets exhibiting different thicknesses, optical properties, and hence, varied electroluminescent efficiencies. Our work suggests that the management of the solvent-vapor atmosphere during in situ crystallization of perovskite films provides a new dimension for controlling their structures and properties. Considering that solvent-vapor atmosphere is a basic parameter for all solution-based processes, our work is of general interest to the perovskite field.",

MnO2 nanoparticles could be easily decorated on the surface of activated carbon (AC) by the reduction of KMnO4 in an acidic medium.

    "abstract": "Materials age, and their properties can evolve over time scales that in many cases can be captured in laboratory experiments. Creep is one of the most commonly observed aging phenomena, and the underlying mechanisms typically involve continuous plastic deformation or diffusion under the applied stress. In the elastic regime and at room temperature, time-dependent deformation is not expected in typical solids, unless the material is viscoelastic. Here, we performed multiscale simulations and discovered that deformation creep and, thus, time evolution of the contact area can occur at asperity contact between solid materials in the absence of plasticity, diffusion, or viscoelasticity. This creep takes place when the material interface is reactive, and it arises from the successive formation of adhesive interfacial chemical bonds that pull the surfaces toward each other. Those chemical bonds not only increase the contact area but also enhance the shear strength, resulting in a synergic effect on aging of frictional contacts, where the static friction increases with the contact time. Our work provides a new contact creep mechanism and, furthermore, reveals that contact aging can originate from not just the increase in the \"contact quantity\"─contact area─but also from the \"contact quality\" ─shear strength─and more importantly, the two mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other.",

We observed spatial emission patterns that are dependent on the angle between the electrical bias and the CNT alignment direction, which are caused not only by the large thermal conductivity anisotropy of the film but also by finite thermal conductance in the CNT-electrode contact. Utilizing the thermal and electrical anisotropy, strongly localized emission was achieved from a narrow (∼1 μm) strip of aligned CNTs connecting edges of two displaced electrodes. This device's unique ability to directly generate polarized ultrabroadband radiation may greatly expand the range of applications of microsized light sources.",

The weak interaction with Au allowed a new corrugation of the 2D material to be detected: ripples with a ∼4 nm periodicity that help stabilize the 2D crystalline layer. On the atomic scale, substantial distortions from ideal hexagonal rings were observed even though crystalline defects were extremely rare. The ring distortions were reproduced in theoretical models that showed that they were associated with a twisting of the 2D kagome lattice, which stabilizes the material when subjected to disturbances. The twisting and rippling impart 2D silica with the flexibility to adapt to strain and changes in the crystallographic direction without introducing defects.",

Here, we report how to control the reaction conditions for the formation of crystalline PI-2DPs. After studying five PI-2DPs cases, we found that the formation rate of amic acid intermediates before their imidization into imide rings plays a crucial role in the subsequent crystallinity of PI-2DPs. Furthermore, calculating the pKa values of the triamine monomers, which is closely related to their nucleophilicity (reactivity), also allows the crystallinity of the resulting PI-2DPs to be predicted. The findings may offer criteria for the design and synthesis of crystalline PI-2DPs.",

A unique silane (MFSi) integrating hydroxyls, tertiary nitrogen, and norbornenyl were prepared by a solvent-free/catalyst-free one-pot method. MFSi can graft onto the rubber chain through a highly efficient norbornenyl/sulfur reaction, while the dangling hydroxyls in MFSi can improve its affinity with silica and tertiary nitrogen has a significant internal catalytic effect on the silanization of silica. As a result, MFSi shows a significantly higher coupling efficiency of silica-filled composites compared to the most widely used SCAs. Consequently, MFSi-modified composites exhibit excellent environmental friendliness, including significantly reduced heat buildup (∼55%) and abrasion loss (∼53%) and VOC emissions (∼42%). We envision that the design of the multifunctional mediator will provide valuable insights into the development of high-performance \"green tires\" in a more environmentally friendly manner.",

    "abstract": "Solar-driven water management such as water purification via evaporation and condensation has gained increasing attention as a promising solution to address the current issues of water and energy scarcity. Herein, a nanocomposite hydrogel incorporating Ag nanoparticle (NP)-loaded boron nanosheets within a polyacrylamide matrix was fabricated, which exhibited excellent solar light absorption efficiency and photothermal conversion capability. Under simulated 1-sun irradiation, the membrane demonstrated an evaporation rate of 4.572 kg m–2 h–1 when used with simulated seawater (∼3.5 wt % NaCl), and the cation concentration in the desalinated water was reduced by 3–4 orders of magnitude. The membrane's excellent performance is attributed to its gradient porous structure with different wettability between the upper and lower surfaces, the plasmonic effect of Ag NPs, and the high water affinity of the boron nanosheets. Additionally, the fabricated membrane showed an excellent pollutant degradation capability and demonstrated potential applications in temperature sensing and thermoelectric generation.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the atomic arrangement of dopant states at high doping concentrations is crucial for understanding structure-property relationships in materials. On the atomic scale, closely connected interfaces, particularly coherent interfaces, can effectively suppress interface-induced trapping processes. Although not yet experimentally verified, heavy doping holds promise for generating heterojunctions within host materials. This study combines spherical aberration-corrected electron microscopy and first-principles calculations to reveal that, at low doping concentrations (1%), Bi primarily occupies W sites, resulting in substitutional doping. However, at high doping concentrations (>10%), we have identified the formation of a Β-Bi2O3 phase within the WO3 host. The formation of these heterojunctions can effectively facilitate electron transfer due to favorable band alignment and potential energy differences between Bi2O3 and WO3. The findings of this study are crucial for rethinking the atomic structures of dopant states at high doping concentrations and their potential application in the development of heterojunctions.",

    "abstract": "To optimize the performance of solid-state batteries, careful control of the material properties is essential. Solid-state batteries require significant mechanical pressure during assembly and cycling to ensure intimate contact and stability of the electrochemical cell. Here we show that mechanical pressure can induce a polymorphic transition (P21/c → Pbca) of sodium dodecahydrido-closo-dodecaborate, Na2B12H12, which increases both the boron dynamics and the ionic conductivity. Heating mechanically pressed samples above 65 °C results in full conversion back to the initial polymorph (P21/c), along with a reduction of one order of magnitude in ionic conductivity, which is consistent with the as-synthesized Na2B12H12. This work emphasizes the important role that postsynthesis treatment can have on the ionic conductivity, the activation energy, and the texture of solid electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we report the synthesis of Li2OHX (X = Br, Cl)-based glasses. These glasses were found to be challenging to synthesize, requiring extreme cooling rates achievable only by a twin-roll quench process. As has been speculated for antiperovskite-derived glasses, indications of improved lithium-ion dynamics are observed. Notably, spin–lattice relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals a higher hopping frequency and significantly lower activation energy for Li2OHBr glasses (0.29 eV) compared to the crystalline Li2OHBr (0.39 eV). This may be attributable to the increased free volume in the glass samples (ρglass/ρcryst = 0.83) and a reduced ionic interaction of lithium ions with the glass structure. Despite these promising findings, the glasses were found to be unstable under pressure and crystallized in attempts to produce bulk samples for impedance measurements.",

However, current designs face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving mechanical properties, along with self-healing capabilities, multimodal sensing, and high sensory precision. In this work, we propose a strategy for the in situ electron beam irradiation-induced copolymerization of highly soluble acrylic acid (AA) and poor-solubility 4-allyloxy-2-hydroxybenzophenone (AHBP) to prepare phase-separated ionogels. AHBP not only enables tunable transparency by adjusting the degree of phase separation but also improves the mechanical properties of the ionogel by modulating the soft/hard domains caused by the solvent-rich and polymer-rich phases. Additionally, AHBP efficiently absorbs UV light through conformational changes. Combined with its excellent conductivity, high thermal stability, and outstanding self-healing and self-adhesive properties, the ionogel-based i-skin demonstrates multimodal sensing capabilities for strain, temperature, and pressure, showing great potential for applications in wearable strain sensors and multisignal sensing arrays.",

However, lattice vibrations and spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GaTe2 are still unexplored, and no room-temperature spin-phonon coupling has been identified in 2D vdW magnets. Here, we report two Raman modes with out-of-plane lattice vibrations in Fe3GaTe2: A1g1 and A1g2, whose frequencies increase as the thickness decreases from bulk to 2D, due to the weakening of interlayer vdW interactions and spin exchange coupling. The phonon band dispersions under ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic interlayer spin ordering indicate the existence of spin-phonon coupling. The temperature-dependent phonon frequency of 2D Fe3GaTe2 diverges from the anharmonic model below the Curie temperature, and thus the spin-phonon coupling strengths are ∼0.24–0.28 cm–1 at 300 K, exhibiting the first experimental identification of room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in 2D vdW magnets. This work deepens the understanding of vdW magnets for spintronics at and above room temperature.",

However, limited K+ insertion remains a bottleneck due to inadequate ion-insertion channels. Herein, we present an engineered g-C3N4 with expanded layer widths for facile ion diffusion, increasing K+ insertion by >250%. This leads to significant layer contraction post K+ insertion (∼3%, 1.5 times larger than before) due to stronger electrostatic attraction, resulting in weaker exciton binding energy (91 meV, ∼57% diminished), near-complete suppression of photoluminescence, and doubling of excited-state electron lifetime as revealed by femtosecond decay kinetics. These improvements led to ∼25 and ∼140 times increments over bare g-C3N4 in H2 and H2O2 production rates, respectively, under visible light. Considering the earth-abundant constituents of g-C3N4, our work establishes a novel design strategy for a highly active, sustainable photocatalyst.",

Taking UTSA-280 ([Ca(C4O4)]n) as an example, the critical metal ion (c(Ca2+)) and deprotonated ligand (c(C4O42–)) concentrations for UTSA-280 nucleation on a gold substrate are determined. It is found that the values of c(Ca2+) × c(C4O42–) in different electrolytes with varied bulk Ca2+ concentrations are similar, which can be seen as an analogue of the solubility product of UTSA-280 considering its chemical formula. Also, a simple yet previously overlooked strategy to shorten the incubation time for MOF nucleation in cathodic deposition is proposed and verified. The presented method can be applied to other MOFs.",

    "abstract": "We systematically investigate the intricate roles of cations as well as anions during phase transformation, specifically, the formation of a metastable phase in phospho-olivine, LiFePO4 (LFP). The cation- and anion-specific electronic structures are studied using a combination of high-resolution soft-to-hard X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that the formation of the metastable phase at higher states-of-charge (SoC) is associated with a decreased oxidation state of iron, assisted by oxygen release. Additionally, we find that phosphorus is active in the charge process, exhibiting reduction, resulting from an electron density redistribution between oxygen and its neighboring iron and phosphorus atoms. Furthermore, the phase transformation process in LFP impacts its magnetic properties, with iron retaining its high-spin configuration along with an increased average spin during its transformation into FePO4 (FP).",

    "abstract": "Magnetophoresis offers a powerful strategy for the targeted delivery of functional microcapsules. Here, we present a combined theoretical and experimental framework to predict the magnetophoretic transport of magnetic nanocultures-microcapsules embedded with magnetic nanoparticles and living cells. We derive a novel analytical expression for the terminal velocity of microcapsules under a spatially decaying magnetic field. The model incorporates magnetic and hydrodynamic forces in low Reynolds number regimes and predicts microcapsule velocity variations with nanoparticle size and field strength. Experimental validation using nanocultures containing nanoparticles 5, 10, and 20 nm in size confirms the model's accuracy, with 10-nm particles showing optimal magnetophoretic response. The model also accounts for hindered motion at high microcapsule densities. This work provides a predictive tool for designing magnetically guided systems for microbial delivery, localization, and patterning, with applications in bioreactors, therapy, and engineered living materials.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid structures have emerged as a promising class of optical materials, due to their ability to couple the robustness of inorganic and the tunability of organic compounds. However, their application in nonlinear optics (NLO) remains limited, largely due to underexplored factors that drive the formation of noncentrosymmetric structures and NLO property characterization. In this work, we explore the formation, structural and temperature polymorphism, and optical properties of the (Et3NH)3Bi2Br9 composition, which crystallizes as either noncentrosymmetric or centrosymmetric polymorph. Structural analysis showed that the alignment of [Bi2Br9]3- units dictates the symmetry of phases, as well as the nonlinear optical properties, with the triclinic polymorph exhibiting a second harmonic generation (SHG) response both in visible and IR regions (1.29 × KH2PO4 and 0.08 × AgGaS2). Thermal analysis reveals polymorphic phase transitions and low melting points, making them melt-processable and ionic liquid candidates.",

    "abstract": "The blending of glassy copolymer-brush modified colloids with a viscoelastic linear copolymer featuring intrinsic self-healing enabled disordered hyperuniform hybrid materials that combined mechanical robustness with structural color, processability, environmental stability, and the ability to recover structure and properties after incurring physical damage via 'integrated self-healing'. Symmetric linear n-butyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate (BA/MMA) were co-assembled with asymmetric glassy BA/MMA statistical copolymer brush (silica) particles. 'Confinement-driven segregation' resulted in a microphase-separated morphology in which the linear copolymer resided within the interstitial regions of a rigid (∼1 GPa) copolymer brush particle template with disordered hyperuniform microstructure. Diffusion of the self-healing copolymer additive into damage regions drove the recovery after damage, along with the restoration of structural color due to the materials hyperuniform microstructure. The synergistic action of intrinsic and extrinsic healing mechanisms could provide a versatile platform for the bottom-up fabrication of multifunctional hybrid materials with increased damage resistance and functional longevity.",

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution has emerged as a promising strategy for the sustainable production of hydrogen energy. Herein, a high-performance Pt-Rh alloy cocatalyst was successfully loaded onto commercial TiO2 (P25) using a solvothermal method. The optimized Pt-Rh alloy-supported P25 catalyst (Pt-Rh/P25) exhibited exceptional photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, achieving a remarkable production rate of 23391.0 μmol·g–1·h–1 under simulated solar irradiation. This performance represents significant enhancements of 2.14-, 3.60-, and 377.2-fold compared to the Pt/P25, Rh/P25, and bare P25 catalysts, respectively, outperforming most reported TiO2-based photocatalytic systems to date. The remarkable photocatalytic performance of Pt-Rh/P25 was attributed to its improved light absorption capacity and enhanced utilization efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Theoretical calculation indicated that Pt-Rh/P25 exhibited optimized *H adsorption free energy, which significantly promoted photocatalytic hydrogen production kinetics. This work highlights the beneficial impact of alloy cocatalysts on enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity and offers insights into the rational design of high-performance photocatalysts.",

Within the biohybrid light-emitting diode (BioHLED) concept, replacing toxic and/or rare photon filters with classical β-barrel fluorescent proteins (FPs) that must withstand irradiation, temperature, oxidation, and dehydration stress, the question if FPs from extremophiles and/or living fossils might be better for lighting applications arises. We addressed this by introducing a thermostable prokaryotic FP, whose inherent promiscuity enables the design of tunable emitting proteins. Three milestones were reached: (i) a comprehensive phylogeny of phycobiliproteins from a large data set (182 proteins from 29 thermophiles) to identify the most versatile zombie-like phycobiliprotein (highly ancestral character), (ii) heterologous expression of this phycobiliprotein (SPritZ) in Escherichia coli and further enhancement via rational mutagenesis into a brighter and more thermal-resilient variant (eSPritZ), and (iii) 2.5-fold stable BioHLEDs comparing SPritZ vs eSPritZ in hydroxypropyl cellulose coatings.",

Extensive research efforts have focused on enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity from alkaline to pure-water conditions. Co-based catalysts have shown high activity and stability for OER across alkaline to near-neutral conditions, making them strong candidates for AEMWE. In addition, electrodeposition offers a simple, scalable, and low-cost method for synthesizing these catalysts with tailored properties. Despite numerous advances in enhancing catalytic performance, comprehensive guidance on tailoring these catalysts to different electrolyte environments remains limited. This study suggests the key factors affecting the activity and durability of electrodeposited Co-based OER catalysts in both KOH and pure-water media. By comparing the electrochemical behavior and catalyst synthesis strategies under these conditions, we identify performance bottlenecks and knowledge gaps and propose strategies to guide the rational design of robust Co-based catalysts for sustainable AEMWE systems.",

In chiral systems, where chirality is introduced via organic amines, this tunability is often limited by the scarcity of suitable chiral cations. In this study, we report a family of 1D lead- and tin-based chiral hybrid halides incorporating a tailor-made cation bearing both amino and hydroxyl functional groups. This chiral ligand enables the synthesis of enantiopure (S/R-AMOL)-SnI3 and (S/R-AMOL)-PbI3, where S/R-AMOL stands for (2S,2'S)-1,1'-azanediylbis-(butan-2-ol) or (2R,2'R)-1,1'-azanediylbis-(butan-2-ol). These compounds exhibit distinctive structural arrangements and bonding interactions, demonstrating effective chirality transfer through chiral centers bearing hydroxyl groups. Remarkably, substantial differences in the electronic structure and chiroptical properties are observed between the Sn and Pb analogues, including variations in emission characteristics, exciton binding energy, and orbital contributions to the electronic structure.",

Here, a cross-linked collagen cryogel scaffold was fabricated by precompression to densify the network. Following lyophilization, the porous scaffolds sustained >90% axial compressive strain with 200 cycles. Ogden hyperelastic modeling and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging revealed fiber alignment, densification, and strain-stiffening contributing to resilience under repetitive large-scale loading. After rehydration, cross-linked and densified hydrogels showed network stability and recoverability under cyclic loading, with significantly reduced phase transition strains compared to non-cross-linked controls. The scaffolds supported cell encapsulation and maintained cell viability after 50 cycles of 90% strain. Cyclic loading significantly densified the encapsulated cells in the loading direction, comparable to nonloaded controls. Overall, these results suggest that densified, shape memory collagen scaffolds provide a mechanically robust and biocompatible system for dynamic environments.",

Through detailed analysis of their crystal structure and theoretical calculations, it was affirmed that the presence of alkyl groups in TPA derivatives leads to a range of aggregation states, which manage the TPA derivatives with or without ML performance. Contrast to various analogues, TTPA-CHO exhibited bright and the most sensitive ML performance under a mechanical force stimulation of 0.1 N. Based on the ultrasensitive ML characteristic, the applications of information storage and encryption were successfully demonstrated.",

The resulting silver bismuth sulfide/antimony bismuth sulfide bilayer photodetectors possess the metrics of both low dark current of antimony bismuth sulfide-based devices and the broad spectral response of silver bismuth sulfide-based photodetectors, exhibiting a synergistic enhancement in performance. The optimized photodiodes achieve an extended detection range up to 1250 nm while demonstrating excellent performance metrics, including ultralow dark current and noise, high sensitivity, fast response and outstanding stability. Moreover, these devices show promising potential for NIR photon-counting and optical communication, offering a viable pathway toward high-performance near-infrared photodetectors working at room temperature.",

Therefore, understanding the structural effects on the charge carrier behavior is essential for device optimization. Herein, we establish the correlation between the conformational disorder of cations and the charge carrier property in 3D perovskitoids using computational and experimental investigations. It is shown that the conformational disorder of N,N′-dimethyl-1,3-propane diammonium (M2PDA) cations induces great distortion of the [Pb2I10]6– inorganic framework in 3D (M2PDA)Pb2I6, leading to distinct charge localization. Moreover, the cation configuration disorder suppresses defect formation, thereby reducing lattice microstrain. These modifications effectively elongate the carrier lifetime and diminish carrier scattering to facilitate charge carrier transport. As a result, a photodetector assembled from (M2PDA)Pb2I6 single crystals achieves a satisfying on/off current ratio of 1.42 × 104 and responsivity of 0.55 A W–1, ranking among the highest-performing devices based on 3D perovskitoids. Moreover, the (M2PDA)Pb2I6 single crystals display superior stability in 100% isopropanol.",

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we investigate the electronic structure evolution from pristine 1T-SnSe2 to the SnSe2–Co(Cp)2 superlattice. We observe increased two-dimensionality in the superlattice and electron doping of the SnSe2 conduction band minimum. This dimensional change, combined with the higher charge carrier density, significantly increases the density of states near the Fermi level, a key factor for superconductivity.

However, this static hydration-based framework fails under real operating conditions of proton ceramic fuel cells, where proton injection and field-driven dynamic processes dominate. This disconnection has led to an underestimation of proton concentration and mobility, also limiting the development of advanced PCOs. Here, we establish a distinct fundamental and experimental framework based on electrochemical proton injection (EPI) and proton–electron spillover, which are dynamic processes enabling an enhanced proton transport both in bulk and across grain boundary domains. Supported by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the distribution of relaxation time, we demonstrate that EPI surpasses the conductivity ceiling imposed by the hydration-limited models. This urgent correction restores the true basis of proton transport and suggests a transformative strategy for designing next-generation oxide electrolytes for electrochemical energy devices.",

    "abstract": "The integration of solid-state inorganic fillers into polymer matrices can improve the performance of solid lithium metal batteries. However, there is poor interface interaction between the polymer matrix and solid-state inorganic fillers, which has led to the performance of solid lithium metal batteries falling far short of expectations. Here, we constructed a bridging interaction based on borate ester dynamic cross-linking to prepare a supertough and self-healing poly(vinylidene fluoride)-hexafluoropropylene/graphene oxide/borate bonds/Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 solid polymer electrolyte. The electrolyte exhibits a wide electrochemical window (4.84 V), high elongation at break (205%), outstanding thermal stability (200 °C), and high-capacity retention (90.3% after 900 cycles under 2C). We further revealed the influence of borate ester dynamic cross-linking on the performance of solid polymer electrolyte through density functional theory calculations. This work offers insight into designing high-performance solid polymer electrolytes for solid-state batteries.",

Enzyme immobilization techniques on COFs are classified into postsynthesis and presynthesis approaches. Furthermore, methodologies for constructing diverse building blocks and critical linkage structures are summarized, alongside detailed elucidation of pore structure modulation techniques─including topological design, template-assisted methods, and defect engineering─employed to enhance compatibility with enzyme dimensions. Finally, emerging types and application scenarios of immobilized enzyme-COF composite systems are analyzed, emphasizing the critical importance of rational design and recoverability in advancing practical application potential.",

Herein, a sustainable and cost-effective approach was used for chicken feather dissolution (a keratin-rich waste) using acetate-based ionic liquids. This method simplifies the development of three-dimensional (3D) structures via directly embedded 3D printing keratin dissolved in ionic liquids (ILs). Using a carbonate-bicarbonate agarose microparticle support bath, we successfully promoted disulfide exchange and direct cross-linking of printed structures with diverse patterns and geometries, exhibiting excellent structural integrity. A comprehensive analysis of the rheological, mechanical, and biological properties was conducted, highlighting their potential biomedical applications. Interestingly, the scaffolds exhibited a dynamic shape-change over time, mediated by cellular traction forces, demonstrating their potential for 4D printing toward innovative bioapplications.",

The degree of PTFE fibrillation during manufacture impacted final sheet properties, and calendering induced fibril alignment and crystallographic texture and macroscopic mechanical anisotropy. Increasing the PTFE fraction by 3.5 wt % led to remarkable improvements in ultimate tensile strength (+900%) and failure strain (+30%). Increasing electrode temperature (>19 °C) delayed sheet failure as PTFE transformed from a triclinic to hexagonal phase, however, higher temperatures (>80 °C) accelerated failure by fibril elongation, pull-out and widespread fibril fracture.",

The HPβCD composite membrane (HPβCD CM) demonstrated stable adsorption performance under acid and alkaline conditions. Within 60 s, the HPβCD CM achieved >70% removal of hydrochlorothiazide, exhibiting an adsorption rate constant 2–3 times higher than those of GAC and single-component β-cyclodextrin polymers. The maximum adsorption capacities of the membrane reached 300 mg/g for HCTZ and 200 mg/g for bendroflumethiazide and indapamide. With its outstanding adsorption performance, cost-effectiveness, and ease of regeneration, the HPβCD CM represents a promising solution for advanced water treatment applications.",

BN-o-OICz shows a small singlet–triplet energy gap, high oscillator strength, and large transition dipole moment alignment through conjugation pathway management, resulting in increased horizontal dipole orientation and reduced device efficiency roll-off. The OLED based on BN-o-OICz demonstrates a deep-blue emission at 456 nm with a fwhm of 25 nm and a high external quantum efficiency of 31.0%. These results underscore the importance of tuning the conjugation pathway to optimize MR-TADF properties and provide an effective strategy for high-performance deep-blue OLEDs.",

This process reveals the presence of two-dimensional CdS, CdSe, ZnSe, and ZnTe haeckelites. We analyze the phonon dispersion relations and lattice thermal conductivity by utilizing machine learning interatomic potentials. The resulting nanosheets demonstrate a dynamic stability and exceptional mechanical properties. Additionally, they exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity ranging from 3 to 30 W/mK, with band gaps of 2.1 to 2.8 eV. Notably, the CdS and CdSe haeckelite structures show high electron and hole mobilities along with strong visible light absorption, making them highly suitable for optoelectronic applications. A particularly intriguing discovery is their negative Poisson's ratio in all directions, indicating auxetic characteristics.",

However, achieving wafer-scale growth of high-quality uniform TMDs films remains challenging. In this study, we demonstrate the wafer-scale growth of monolayer tungsten disulfides (WS2) using metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, a widely adopted method in compound semiconductor fabrication. The resulting WS2 films exhibit high uniformity and optical properties comparable to exfoliated single-crystal. Film quality was further enhanced by spin-coating sodium chloride as a promoter prior to growth, which increased grain size from tens to hundreds of nanometers and significantly improved optical performances. These improvements, commonly observed for other TMDs, are attributed to suppressed nucleation and promoted lateral crystal growth facilitated by liquid-phase intermediates. Our findings provide a scalable pathway for high-crystallinity TMDs in film production.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the sublimation of organic compounds during perovskite deposition via coevaporation is challenging. The sublimation behavior of these materials depends strongly on their purity, and their low sticking coefficient on sensors complicates deposition rate monitoring, hindering reproducibility, particularly when multiple organic sources are involved. We introduce a novel approach in which the precursor powder is pressed into a pellet, reducing material consumption and pressure fluctuation during coevaporation. This pellet can also incorporate multiple compounds, enabling, for example, the simultaneous sublimation of methylammonium iodide and chloride from a single source. Combined with a Pb(I1–xBrx)2 source, this method makes it possible to deposit triple-halide MAPIBrCl perovskite films. We confirm the incorporation of chloride in the perovskite lattice, which proves to be beneficial for the charge transport properties of the film, increasing the fill factor in wide-bandgap solar cells. Using this approach, we achieved a champion PCE of 19.5% for a 1.66 eV bandgap perovskite.",

Most of the common filaments for the fused filament fabrication form of 3D printing are inherently flammable thermoplastics, which has led to numerous fires that pose a serious danger to lives and property. In an effort to improve the safety of these filaments, a unique composite of polylactic acid (PLA) and a flame-retardant polyelectrolyte complex, consisting of polyvinylamine and poly(sodium phosphate), was developed. This composite filament can be printed using an ordinary 3D printer under identical conditions to neat PLA. The filament and its printed parts are self-extinguishing in an open flame test and exhibit a 42% lower peak heat release rate, as measured by microscale combustion calorimetry. This unique filament concept solves a major safety problem for 3D printing and could be extended to other commonly used polymer filaments.",

Here, we present the combination of these two components into an individually encapsulated frame-in-frame structure. Via the surface functionalization with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the bridging layer, the Pt–Ni nanoframe is encased in a special MOF, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), to achieve a single core–shell structure, as evidenced by the three-dimensional tomography. The growth trajectory of such frame-in-frame nanocomposite is also tracked, revealing that ZIF-8 first nucleates in the solution, then attaches to the surface of the nanoframe, and finally grows to capture the entire nanoframe, accomplishing the one-in-one encapsulation. Following the same concept, by utilizing ZIF-67 as the sacrificial layer, the Pt–Ni nanoframe is further solely embedded in ZIF-8 to form the single yolk–shell structure, which has a cavity between the core and the shell. This work provides a new method to build frame-in-frame structures, consisting of different frameworks, and to explore their synergistic properties.",

In this work, we report a novel understanding of the active sites responsible for the catalytic activity of aluminum trimesate MOFs and their crystal/framework structure dependency. Here, we have studied the nature of the active sites of Al-MOFs with two different framework structures (MIL-100 and MIL-96). We found that the MOFs with MIL-100 framework structures were highly catalytically active, while the same Al-MOFs with MIL-96 framework structures exhibited poor catalytic activity. This behavior is explained based on the effect of coordinated water molecules on their Brønsted acidity as well as the effect of the coordination of Al sites, specifically hexacoordinated Al3+6c sites and pentacoordinated Al3+5c sites, on their Lewis acidity. The different entrance sizes of the catalytic pocket of MIL-96 and MIL-100 also played critical roles in their catalytic performance.",

The probe is weakly emissive when it is selectively internalized by estrogen receptor-positive cells. Under photoirradiation, its emission can be turned on to report the intracellular distribution.

Here, we report a strategy for the preparation of antioxidant copper under ambient UV/visible or high-energy irradiation using surface-coordinated carbon dioxide anion radicals (CO2•–). It is shown that effective adsorption of CO2•– on copper leads to further formation of bidentate formate multilayers, which hardly degrades surface characteristics but is resistant to chemical attack from a range of highly corrosive solutions such as H2O2, NaCl, Na2S, and NaOH. Due to the universality of free radical production, the anticorrosion procedure requires no high temperature and pressure, as well as the specific container, enabling the processing of various sizes and shapes of copper materials. In addition, we demonstrated several practical advantages: the passivation of different shapes can be easily achieved under natural sunlight; using an industrial electron beam, 10 m oxidation-resistant copper foil can be made in only 90 s. The antioxidation method can use waste CO2 as CO2•– source, thus opening up a complementary opportunity for CO2 immobilization.",

The utilization of MOF materials in industrial applications requires the materials to exhibit suitable operational thermal stability. This is important for materials to perform efficiently in temperature cycling processes commonly found in industrial applications. Herein, we present a thermal stability analysis of various ligand-substituted MOF-808 derivatives along with an evaluation method to determine how these and other structural changes can directly affect thermal cycling stability. Through this analysis, high magnitude (−119 ppm/K) and cyclable negative thermal expansion (NTE) is identified in MOF-808-SO4.

Quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements were employed to reveal the reaction mechanism that Fe2O3 could be partially reduced by Li+ forming LixFe alloy, and reoxidized to amorphous Fe2O3. According to the galvanostatic current test of symmetric battery, the voltage had no significant changed after 1500 h, which proved that multifunctional membrane electrode effectively reduced the effect of Li dendrites. The assembled coin battery delivered an initial capacity of 125.9 mA h g–1 and still maintained at 114.9 mA h g–1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, with a capacity decay rate of only 0.048% per cycle. The pouch cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability with a Coulombic efficiency of >99.2% after 70 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides a novel flexible membrane electrode design in solving the Li dendrites and developing novel electrodes for Li metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "Herein we propose a new way to drive and control directional molecular motion on graphene by modifying the noncovalent interactions (NCIs). We show that molecules noncovalently interacting with graphene selectively diffuse away from the mountain (negative curvature) regions to the valley (positive curvature) regions. This is in contrast to previously reported molecular migration from the valley to the mountain of covalently attached molecules on graphene. To generalize the concept, we investigate a series of NCIs, including π–π, C–H––π, lone pair−π, halogen−π, cation−π, and anion−π, and find the same robust trend. We further demonstrate that such directional motion of noncovalently bonded molecules can be exploited to create binding sites with tunable chemisorption energy on curved graphene. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we consider the motion of strong electron acceptor tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and show that a noticeable change in chemisorption energy can be attained for a set of adsorbates as a consequence of NCI-driven molecular migration of TCNQ. Thus, we propose that NCI-driven molecular migration can provide an additional controllable dimension to overcome the fundamental limitations of heterogeneous catalysis using 2D materials.",

Unfortunately, PVA suffers from problems associated with large leakage current, poor stability, and insufficient transparency. Impurities, particularly those related to sodium, are the major cause of the poor electric-optical characteristics when PVA acts as dielectric layer or substrate. However, removal of sodium-associated impurities has been one of the daunting challenges. Here, an ecofriendly supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2)-assisted hydration (SAH) strategy is introduced to eliminate the deep-seated sodium-related impurities. Ultrapurified PVA is obtained with outstanding insulation and high transmittance via a room-temperature SAH process, resulting in a 100-fold reduction in leakage, better stability, and up to 98% transparency in PVA-based devices. The SAH approach, which can effectively utilize and recycle CO2, offers competitive advantages in developing entirely ecofriendly processes and devices, as well as a viable avenue to improve biocompatible materials and electronics.",

Therefore, methods and materials that provide afterglow imaging with higher resolution remain to be developed. In this study, we performed photoinduced triplet depletion and demonstrated improved resolution of bright afterglow emission using the depletion. Triplet depletion is related to charge separation via photoionization from a triplet state caused by depletion and subsequent rapid singlet formation. Triplet excitons that accumulated in a solid material by excitation were depleted under irradiation using a depletion beam with a longer wavelength than the absorption wavelength of the material. A higher-resolution afterglow image with an improvement of 25% was obtained by simultaneously focusing a donut-shaped depletion beam and an excitation beam.",

Herein, we found that the noncarboxylate MOF Cd(trz)Cl (trz = 1,2,4-trizaole) can also exhibit intrinsic volumetric NTE, and a transition from NTE to PTE at high temperatures can be observed. The combined in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra measurements, and DFT calculations shed light on the fact that the NTE mainly originates from the synergistic effect of geometric flexibility and the enhanced out-of-plane rotation behavior of the trz ligand. This study not only demonstrates a new NTE material but also can help to extend the scope of NTE to the more diverse noncarboxylate based MOFs.",

However, low sensitivity and poor mechanical properties limit their practical applications in integrated haptic platforms such as artificial skin. Here, photoluminescence (PL)-type humidity sensing materials with simultaneously high sensitivity, stretchability, and healability are reported based on poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composite gels comprising CdxSe1–xZnyS1–y quantum dots (QDs). A droplet-assisted strategy is developed to achieve a uniform distribution of QDs throughout the polymer matrix and also to assist with, in combination with freeze–thaw and freeze–dry cycles, the formation of micropores during the gel preparation process that improves moisture adsorption. With further ligand optimization, the PVA/QD composite gels exhibit an excellent PL–humidity linearity (R2 > 99%), a wide humidity sensing range (from 11% to 93%), short response/recovery time (∼40 s), and good recoverability and cyclic stability (over 100 cycles). The humidity sensing mechanism is attributed to surface state changes of the QDs that are induced by intermolecular interactions between QD ligands and water molecules, as revealed by molecular vibration studies and density function theory calculations. This work opens avenues for the development of high-performance humidity-sensitive materials that are promising for next-generation tactile sensors and artificial skin and provides fundamental insights into the sensing mechanism of PL-based humidity QD sensors.",

This molecular cage binds 2-chloro-9H-thioxanthen-9-one (TXO) for boosting PET via a pseudointramolecular pathway to oxidize CeIII–Cl to CeIV–Cl and form TXO•–. The LMCT excitation of CeIV–Cl is triggered to form Cl• that activates C(sp3)−H via HAT, resulting in the regeneration of CeIII–Cl and the formation of an alkyl radical. TXO•– reduces the reaction intermediate, which transforms C(sp3)−H and facilitates recovery of TXO for subsequent recycling. This approach offers a feasible strategy for creating highly electrophilic radicals resembling enzymes and demonstrates their potential for C(sp3)−H functionalization.",

Here, we report the first complete reaction energy landscape of metal–organic framework (MOF) interpenetration, specifically in the phase transformation of NU-1200 to its doubly interpenetrated counterpart, STA-26. We characterized the thermodynamics of this phase transformation by pairing experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This analysis revealed that factors such as the increase in crystal density likely drive Zr- and Hf-NU-1200 to STA-26 interpenetration, while other chemical interactions such as steric repulsions prevent Th-NU-1200 from interpenetrating. Using time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction, we monitored phase transformation reaction profiles and extracted quantitative kinetic information using the Avrami-Erofe'ev model. As a result, we obtained activation energies for the Zr- and Hf-NU-1200 transformations to Zr- and Hf-STA-26, respectively, revealing slower phase change kinetics for MOFs with stronger bonds. Finally, we paired the kinetic data with experimental observations to classify the mechanistic model of this phase transformation as partial dissolution. We anticipate that this thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic understanding will broadly inform further studies on the energetics of crystallization.",

Enlightened by natural photosynthesis, a photoelectrochemical system based on covalently linked light-harvesting complexes and plasmonic particles is designed for the purpose of obtaining superior photoelectrochemical performances and applications. It has been found that peridinin-chlorophyll-protein (PCP), a water-soluble light-harvesting antenna protein, could be well assembled and form closed, as well as ordered, arrangements on the surface of gold microplates via covalent linking, which results in excellent fluorescence enhancement. Further, the designed photoelectrochemical system not only presents improved light-harvesting ability and electric property but also displays over 14 times higher photocurrent performances than the photoelectrochemical system composed of unlinked and randomly distributed PCP complexes on the surface of gold microplates. We think the superior performances of the designed photoelectrochemical system are benefited from the enhanced light-harvesting ability, improved efficiency of electron generation, separation and transfer, abundant excited electrons, and excellent chemical and photoelectrochemical stability due to the self-assembly of PCP complexes and formation of close and ordered arrangements on the large plane surface of gold microplates via covalent linking. Significantly, our designed photoelectrochemical system presents very superior activity and promising applications in visible-light-driven water splitting, as its hydrogen generation speed is accelerated over 11 times that of the unlinked gold microplates and PCP complexes system. In a word, our research provides an effective way for preparing photoelectrochemical systems with excellent light-harvesting ability, great photoelectrochemical performances, and high stability, which has displayed practical application in water splitting for hydrogen generation.

We demonstrate an approach to realize interfaces with unprecedented quality using a single-step fabrication approach. By simultaneously depositing two asymmetric contacts on a suspended 2D material, the effect of oxidation and voiding can be avoided. Graphene-based spin valves show a strong interaction at the interface that leads to exceptional magnetoresistance values. This advance permits the characterization of the intrinsic spin properties at the Co/graphene interface, and we establish the limitations of traditional Hanle-based spin-lifetime measurements. Finally, we investigate the differences in spin transport for multilayer graphene-based spin valves. An increased level of spin-scattering is observed that limits the achievable performance and provides guidelines for the future integration of 2D materials in spintronic devices.",

This unpredictability creates a substantial disparity between the synthetic devices and actual biological systems in terms of the cognitive processing efficiency. To address this challenge, we use bioderived materials to develop a bimodal memristor that is activated by either voltage or protons. This mimics biological systems in which the interactions between electrons and ions play a crucial role in cognitive processing. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of functional groups on the bimodally operating memristor characteristics at the molecular level. Our findings show that the phenolic functional group enhances the ionic conductivity, thereby reducing the power consumption during memristive operation. We believe that this research not only presents a more efficient biorealistic device but also establishes design principles for low-power bimodal memristors.",

    "abstract": "The molecular design of various heterocycles incorporated into photochromic diarylethenes plays an important role in diversifying functionality. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and structural characterization of photochromic benzo[b]germole-fused diarylethenes. Photochromic behaviors including clean conversion between the open and the photogenerated closed forms under ambient conditions over multiple photoswitching cycles with insignificant loss of photochemical reactivity, thermal irreversibility with negligible backward reaction of the photogenerated closed form back to the open form even at 100 °C, and satisfactory and comparable photochromic quantum yields for the forward and backward photoswitching processes are observed. This work demonstrates the employment of a rarely explored germole ring with weak aromaticity as a versatile building block for the ethene bridge of the photochromic diarylethene, which is the first of its kind to construct photochromic materials for potential applications, further expanding the diversity of the heterocycle-fused diarylethene-based system with interesting photocontrolled functions.",

    "abstract": "Stimuli-responsive nanoparticles have attracted considerable attention as nanocarriers for the intact intracellular delivery of active biotherapeutics with high stability and controllability. In this study, we developed light- and heat-responsive gold-collagen hydrogel nanoparticles (Au-CHPs) for the intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins. Au-CHPs composed of collagen, thermosensitive polymers, and gold nanoparticles were fabricated by the simultaneous reduction of gold ions during radical polymerization. Under resonant light, Au-CHPs induce proximate environmental changes by immediately increasing the local temperature. Three proteins, fibroblast growth factor, superoxide dismutase, and epidermal growth factor, with different cellular functions were electrostatically incorporated into the Au-CHPs with a high loading efficiency of over 57%. Photothermal triggering through Au-CHPs boosted wound healing, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and cellular spheroid growth, owing to the on-demand release and rapid diffusion of proteins. We envision that stimuli-responsive hybrid materials for carrying bioactive proteins will help with the development of controlled delivery systems for biomedical and cosmeceutical applications.",

    "abstract": "Excess lipid accumulation and the progressive aggravation of chronic inflammation are the main characteristics of atherosclerosis (AS). Inducing autophagy has been proven to improve abnormal lipid metabolism and limitedly reduce the inflammatory response of macrophages. However, when the accumulation of inflammation exceeds the regulatory range of autophagy, the autophagy will become unbalanced. Therefore, we designed a short peptide-based hydrogel containing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, to load with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for the anti-inflammatory and pro-autophagy synergistic therapy of AS. Fe3O4 activates autophagy, leading to a decrease in the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and an increase in cholesterol excretion. By combination with anti-inflammatory agents, the occurrence of foam cells was decreased, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were suppressed. Particularly, with autophagy activation, the decrease of macrophage apoptosis and the increase of macrophage burial further favored the stability of atherosclerotic plates. This study concentrates on the utilization of Fe3O4 to stimulate autophagy in macrophages and explores the potential of combining it with an anti-inflammatory peptide hydrogel for synergistic therapy, offering innovative approaches for treating AS.",

    "abstract": "Sunlight is an ideal energy source for the catalytic degradation of micropollutants from water. However, it remains a challenge to achieve efficient sunlight-driven micropollutants degradation. Here, we report the integration of a 3D printed flow-through photoreactor with a Z-scheme AgI/Bi2WO6/poly(ether sulfone) (AgI/Bi2WO6/PES) photocatalytic membrane for light-driven removal of antibiotics and steroid hormones. Notably, the rates of photocatalytic micropollutants removal are achieved above 96% over a wide range of concentrations, from 200 ng L–1 to 10 mg L–1, setting the highest record as compared to the reported cases to date. Under natural sunlight, an impressive 99% removal rate for LEV is demonstrated. We technologically determine the limiting factor for micropollutant degradation, while the photocatalytic mechanism is fundamentally elucidated with experimental evidence. This work provides an effective approach to removing micropollutants under sunlight and offers insights for the design of water treatment devices through the synergy of 3D printed photoreactors and heterojunction materials.",

    "abstract": "The practical application of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction requires adaptation to the fluctuating voltage output of photovoltaic systems. However, potential-induced in-situ reconstruction of the catalyst complicates control and leads to Faradaic efficiency (FE) instability across the potential window. Here, we present a redox graphene-supported indium oxide catalyst (G-InOx), where rGO effectively regulates the surface evolution of InOx from In3+ to In0 during electrocatalytic reactions. The multivalent In generated via electrocatalytic in-situ reconstruction lowers the energy barriers for *OCHO formation and dissociation, enhancing formate production. rGO also regulates the surface environment, optimizing CO2 and proton delivery to the active sites. Over a wide potential range (−0.86 to −1.37 V vs RHE), G-InOx achieves FEformate nearly 100%. This work offers a straightforward and efficient strategy for scalable, high-performance CO2 electroreduction.",

    "abstract": "The intricate porous network of cryogels enhances diffusivity, injectability, and shape-recovery properties, providing a valuable tool for minimally invasive biomedical applications. However, the injection of cell-loaded complex structures remains highly challenging. Here, we demonstrate the freeform 3D printing of fully protein-based macroporous cryogels with cell-adsorptive and shape-recoverable features. The 3D-printed cryogels surpass conventional cryogels, revealing successful injection, cell-adsorptive features, and a high interconnected porosity (99.2%). The rapid hydration process enables the efficient incorporation of individual cells or spheroids into the cryogel network. Using an in-liquid cell aspiration method, the constructs retained cellular content up to 89%, with in vitro culture revealing high viability and cell spreading over 14 days. Our findings highlight the potential of the cryogels’ macroporosity for cell loading and injectability. We anticipate that these off-the-shelf cryogels will pave the way for a new generation of self-adsorptive and injectable cryogels.",

    "abstract": "We report herein the ultrahigh stability of n-channel organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on ladder poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), without any encapsulation, which have remained fully functional after over 21 years of storage in ambient air, marking an unprecedented milestone for organic electronic devices. Although the BBL OFETs, fabricated in 2003 and 2011, had excellent functionality, the figures of merit slightly degraded from their original values. Thermal annealing of the aged OFETs enabled a complete reversal of the degradation process and full recovery of the electron transport properties. Trap density of states spectral analysis and characterization of OFET performance as a function of thermal annealing show that the ambient air-induced trapping sites accumulated at the semiconductor/dielectric interface over the long term are fully passivated. Our results provide evidence of over 21-year ambient air stability of BBL OFETs and offer insights into the potential design of next-generation semiconducting polymers and organic electronic devices with excellent stability.",

    "abstract": "Strategies for developing safer energetic materials (EMs) have long been a focus in the field. Realization of activatable explosives has seen some progress, with the few existing examples based on switchable desensitization of sensitive monomolecular EMs; absent are activatable EMs comprising nonenergetic components. Here, a metal–organic framework (MOF)-based strategy is used to formulate explosive materials from completely nonenergetic components that are combined to achieve controlled, on-demand sensitivity. Application of this strategy resulted in EMs that are insensitive to impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge but become explosive only when heated beyond the point of oxidizer melt infiltration into the MOF. The structural metal in the MOF dramatically influences thermal sensitivity, heat evolution, and gas release. Controlled sensitization of inert components through heating, enabling nanoscopic mixing of fuel, oxidizer, and catalyst by melt infiltration, presents a strategy to produce safer-to-handle EMs.",

Under UV excitation, the controllable conversion between SP-Br and the merocyanine isomer MC-Br allows dynamic and continuous changes in the refractive index, thus enabling the function of repeated writing and erasing of optical paths in the optical waveguide device. The ability to dynamically adjust the refractive index provides unprecedented flexibility in the design and fabrication of an optical waveguide device.",

Herein, we designed constitutionally isomeric PHDCs that self-assembled in aqueous solution into either nanoribbons, nanofibers, or nanobelts with various dimensions based on cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. Nile-red loaded PHDCs showed morphology-dependent uptake by H9C2 cells based on fluorescence microscopy combined with flow cytometry and confocal imaging, where narrow, helically twisted nanoribbons entered most efficiently. All PHDCs released H2S at similar rates, but the amount of H2S released inside the cells depended on the internalization ability of each PHDC. Consistent with these results, the narrow twisted nanoribbons afforded the greatest protection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Overall, this study highlights how subtle molecular-level changes can influence nanostructure formation in supramolecular assemblies and ultimately affect their cellular uptake and biological activities.",

Here, we present a multi-walled carbon nanotube porin sensing system to identify single and isomeric amino acids in peptides. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that strong van der Waals (vdW) interactions between peptide side chains and the nanotube interior slow translocation, with the interaction strength varying by amino acid. By utilizing the smooth tubular structure of the carbon nanotube's inner wall, we demonstrate the ability to simultaneously consider steric hindrance effects and vdW interactions as the primary factors for distinguishing proteinogenic amino acids. We show that the sensing system can directly identify up to 10 proteinogenic amino acids, including isomers, and locate single-residue substitutions in peptides at subnanometer resolution. These findings have the potential to lay the foundation for protein sequencing.",

This study explores hydrogels made from squid pen protein (SPP) and chitosan, biodegradable polymers, for anionic dye adsorption─reactive blue 4 (RB4) and methyl orange (MO). A 50%/50% SPP/chitosan hydrogel was optimal for RB4 adsorption while minimizing chitosan use. Adsorption followed the Langmuir model, with capacities of 151.52 mg/g for RB4 and 54.94 mg/g for MO. Optimal RB4 adsorption conditions were 65 °C, 6 h, pH 7, and 0.2 wt % adsorbent at 300 rpm. Kinetic analysis indicated a pseudo-second-order model, suggesting chemisorption. Characterization (FT-IR, SEM, XPS) revealed functional groups and binding mechanisms, with XPS confirming a nucleophilic attack between the amino groups of chitosan/SPP protein and RB4's dichlorotriazine moiety. Higher cross-linker content reduced adsorption. This study demonstrates SPP/chitosan hydrogels as a cost-effective, sustainable alternative for wastewater treatment.",

Notably, these compounds are soluble in various organic solvents, allowing their properties to be investigated in solution, unlike traditional fullerene-based superatomic crystals. The ion pairs can be further assembled into organometallic polymers using Janus-bis(NHCs) to cross-link the oxidized M4S4 units. We show that the superatomic polymers are more conductive than both the precursor superatomic crystals and the polymers containing only neutral M4S4 clusters. Similar conductivity values can be obtained when neutral M4S4–NHC polymers are doped with solutions of C60 fullerene. These findings demonstrate that next generation superatomic materials can be prepared via the combination of charge transfer and polymerization with appropriate cross-linking agents.",

Although β spodumene exhibits up to 5 orders of magnitude higher lithium-ion diffusivity, both phases have diffusion activation energies between 0.8 and 1 eV, indicating that polymorph density is not the controlling factor over diffusivity. We show that aluminum vacancies facilitate lithium-ion diffusion in α-spodumene by reducing the migration barrier from 2.4 to 0.9 eV. Bond valence site energy and nudged elastic band calculations show a new lithium local minimum site which promotes a one-dimensional percolation network by reducing the lithium intersite distance from 4.5 Å to 2.9 Å. However, aluminum vacancies are energetically unfavorable to percolate through the whole structure, resulting in very low net lithium diffusivity and highlighting the critical role of nonstoichiometric defects in facilitating lithium transport in rigid aluminosilicate structures.",

Simultaneously applying isovalent and aliovalent substitution can enhance ionic conductivity by generating substantial site disorder and high vacancy concentrations. To elucidate the mechanism that facilitates sodium ion conduction, a series of mixed-pnicogen solid solutions were prepared from the parent ternary sulfides Na3PnS4 (Pn = P, As, Sb) by high-temperature reactions, including an entropy-driven W-substituted phase, Na3−δP0.32As0.32Sb0.32W0.04S4 (N-PASS-W). N-PASS-W exhibits a very high ionic conductivity of 10 mS cm–1 and a low activation energy of 0.15 eV. Using PXRD and NMR spectroscopy, an atomic-level model for N-PASS-W was proposed, in which ion hopping occurs over two Na sites within a tetragonal structure (P4̅21c). Relationships were also established between the structure and ionic conductivities of the other members to evaluate the influence of crystalline phase, cation size, and site disorder.",

PSHG provides diffraction-limited information on fibril anisotropy and helical pitch angle, while s-SNOM, paired with atomic force microscopy, yields nanoscale optical properties such as refractive index and extinction coefficient alongside topographic context. Using type I collagen fibrils from bovine tendons, we examine structural and optical changes induced by noncollagenous matrix elements, laser-induced denaturation, oxidative stress, and thermal exposure.

When MOFs are used in liquid-phase applications, such as catalysis, they are often activated according to best practices but subsequently submerged in high-surface-tension solvents. The destructive potential of this process is demonstrated here using a range of model systems. Furthermore, a method for avoiding this damage, termed reverse solvent exchange (RSE), is outlined. RSE involves resolvation with low-surface-tension solvents followed by exchange into higher-surface-tension solvents. The efficacy of this protocol is shown for several MOFs, including the highly fragile FJI-1, for which resolvation-induced MOF collapse can be almost entirely ameliorated. This work informs best practices for MOF resolvation by ensuring that MOF function is maximized and that performance results are not convoluted by solvation-induced framework damage.",

The dispersibility of photocatalysts could be altered by the exchange of anions on the nanoparticles, which thereby covers a wide range of solvents from water to toluene. The optimized wettability of the photocatalysts in desired solvents was demonstrated by two model reactions under visible light irradiation, namely, photodegradation of tetracycline in water and photooxidative coupling of benzylamines in acetonitrile.

It remains a challenge to create effective noncovalent linkage between the components within the drug vectors. In this work, we report a supramolecular approach to construct multifunctional nanoparticles, which combined tumor-targeting capability via saccharide, cell penetration via positive-charged surface, and chemotherapeutic function via drug delivery for cancer therapy. A endogenous self-associating nucleotide (guanosine monophosphate) noncovalently bonded with a hydrophobic nucleoside analogue drug (clofarabine) to form nanofibrils, which were transformed to spherical nanoparticles by assembling with a fructose/ethanolamine-functionalized starlike poly(glycidyl methacrylate)-based cationic polymer. Noncovalent cavities within the nanoparticles were created, through the nucleotide self-association, and acted as linkage between the hydrophilic cationic polymer and the drug. The saccharide-tethering polycation and nucleotide components were labeled with fluorescent dyes, respectively, to image the endocytosis and biodistribution. In vitro and in vivo results show that the functional nanoparticles exhibited good capabilities of the targeted accumulation of the nanoparticles and delivery of drugs in cancer cells and tumor sites, leading to a robust anticancer effect.",

Herein, we report a facile approach for the fabrication of erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC)-membrane-camouflaged nanocarriers (RBC-MCNs) that exhibit tunable paclitaxel (PTX) release kinetics via altering macromolecular stereostructure. In this approach, biocompatible isotactic and atactic polylactides (PLAs) with similar molar masses (Mn = 8.2–8.9 kDa, as measured by NMR spectroscopy) and dispersities (Đ < 1.1, as measured by size exclusion chromatography) were synthesized via organocatalyzed ring-opening polymerizations (ROPs), providing tunable crystalline structures via polymer tacticity, while RBC membranes provided biomimetic surfaces and improved colloidal stability of PLA nanoconstructs in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of the lyophilized nanoconstructs suggested significant retention of PLA stereocomplexation upon loading the hydrophobic anticancer drug PTX, enabling control over drug release kinetics. The structure–property relationships were maintained after the RBC coating, with 100% stereocomplexed PLA RBC-MCNs exhibiting the least PTX release during the first 12 h in PBS at 37 °C, compared to 2-, 3-, and 4-fold higher amounts of release for the 50% stereocomplexed, isotactic, and amorphous PLA counterparts, respectively. The extended release of PTX from the 100% stereocomplexed PLA RBC-MCNs resulted in an increased IC50 (0.50 μM) against SJSA osteosarcoma cells, relative to amorphous PLA RBC-MCNs (IC50 = 0.25 μM) or free PTX (IC50 = 0.05 μM). In contrast, non-PTX-loaded RBC-MCNs were not cytotoxic, and they also displayed lower immunotoxic responses against RAW 264.7 macrophage cells compared to RBC membrane vesicles. This work represents fundamental advances toward a potential personalized nanocarrier technology that would be capable of employing an individual's RBCs for membrane isolation, together with tuning of cargo loading and release simply via alteration of the biocompatible PLA stereoisomer feed ratio.",

Herein, we report a proposed strategy for the synthesis of a porous metal silicate (PMS) material (denoted as PMS-2) by employing molecular Cu/Co-benzoate coordination complex as the template. The pore distribution, particle size, and redox metallic site could be systematically controlled by tuning the counterbalance of Cu/Co ions, and the concentrations of benzoic acid and tetraethyl orthosilicate. PMS-2 results in low apparent activation temperature of 50 °C and high turnover frequency of 24.9 h–1 at 110 °C for hydrogenation of furfural, which represents the most active catalyst, compared with the noble metal-free catalysts in the literature. The unique catalytic properties of PMS-2 should be ascribed to the synergistic work between Cu and Co metal sites, high surface area (675 m2g–1) and narrow pore size distribution (∼1.5 nm) for the unique PMS material, which can be further developed for extensive catalytic reactions.",

Here, we demonstrate in situ three-dimensional imaging of lithium whisker using a grating-interferometry-based tricontrast X-ray microtomography method. Our approach explicitly reveals the micromorphology of the electrochemically developed porous lithium whisker with micrometer-level spatial resolution while offering sensitivity to the nanoporosity that is smaller than the nominal resolution limit. Our result reveals valuable structural information on the lithium whisker that is otherwise inaccessible.

Moreover, this method did not require expensive or toxic reagents and could modify a variety of functional polymers on the bacterial surface in one step.

However, most treatments have focused on modulating nonspecific immunity and ignored the importance of specific immunity in SCI. In this study, an \"Inner–Outer\" Metformin (Met) and anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody (CD80 mAb)-loaded fiber-hydrogel scaffold (P/G-Met-CD80 mAb) was constructed through microsol-electrospinning and UV illumination methods. The P/G-Met-CD80 mAb scaffolds exhibited good biocompatibility and hydrophilicity, facilitating cell proliferation and adhesion. In addition, the scaffolds were capable of releasing CD80 mAb and Met sequentially, exerting their protected functions at different stages post-SCI in rats. The released CD80 mAb at an early stage significantly inhibited specific immune response by blocking T-cell costimulatory activation and reducing IL-2 secretion, improving the inflammatory microenvironment after SCI. Late stage-released Met recruited neural stem cells (NSCs) to the injury area and enhanced NSCs differentiation into neurons. The P/G-Met-CD80 mAb scaffolds with specific immunomodulatory functions and neurogenic potential provide a new strategy for repairing SCI in the clinic.",

In response to this challenge, we proposed a dual-decoy strategy using both heparin (an analogue of heparan sulfate) and ACE2 to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. We developed a heparin-conjugated ACE2-bearing extracellular vesicle system (haEVs), serving as nano dual bait, with high efficiency in neutralizing the Omicron variant through interactions with the viral Spike protein. In vitro experiments showed that haEVs bound to the pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and effectively prevented the pseudovirus infection of host cells. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that inhalable haEVs effectively blocked the pseudovirus infection of lung tissue of the Omicron variant with good biosafety. This dual-decoy approach presents a promising avenue for combating SARS-CoV-2, especially the Omicron variant, with the advantage of self-administration for preventive and therapeutic applications.",

Here, we find that hourglass nodal loops (HNLPs)/lines (HNLEs) emerge in the phonon spectra of materials XF (X = Ba, Sr, Ca). Specifically, the HNLPs are enforced by nonsymmorphic symmetry, while the HNLEs which are throughout the Brillouin zone are guaranteed by simultaneous operations of symmorphic and nonsymmorphic symmetries. Notably, the hourglass nodal loops are tangent to four hourglass nodal lines, thus forming an hourglass cage located between two double-degenerate terminals. The two terminals, i.e., nodal surface (NS) and quadratic nodal lines (QNLs), exhibit quite flat dispersion. In addition, when going from NS to QNLs along a generic path, states will undergo a partner switching, leading to a band crossing in the hourglass shape. As a consequence, the neck points of hourglass shape dispersion finally form an hourglass nodal surface in its 3D Brillouin zone, which has not been predicted before. Furthermore, this family of materials enjoys the spacetime inversion symmetry, so that the nodal loops/lines feature a quantized Berry phase. This leads to drumhead surface states on their projection surfaces. Our findings present a novel topological phonon in realistic materials.",

Herein, the effects of the phase distribution on the intrinsic carrier dynamics in (PEA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films were systematically studied using highly sensitive transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). The (PEA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films with 2D/3D bulk heterojunctions and 3D (MAPbI3)/2D-3D mixed phase planar heterojunctions were prepared, respectively. Our results show that electrons transfer from 2D phases to the 3D phase in the non-carrier density-dependent region, but not between 2D phases in the 2D-3D mixed phases. Our investigations reveal that the carrier transport in quasi-2D perovskite films is primarily determined by the spatial distribution of the 2D phases. The desired phase distributions for the efficient carrier transport were proposed based on the TAS results.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the degradability of polyethylene (PE) through keto group incorporation stands as a rising research frontier. The overall impact of these functional groups on PE's degradability and mechanical properties at the atomic scale is not fully understood. Employing computer simulations, we investigate the degradability and mechanical properties of keto-modified PE (KMPE). Adding keto groups to the PE chain decreases its photostability, our findings reveal that increase in keto group concentration further amplifies degradation, albeit with minimal impact on photostability. Increasing the keto content (up to 5% in our simulations) leads to reduced polymer crystallinity, while the associated loss in mechanical strength is limited. This study shows that hydrogen bonding plays a compensatory role in KMPE by mitigating the reduction in mechanical properties due to keto group addition, effectively counterbalancing structural alterations to maintain mechanical integrity. These insights deepen our understanding of KMPE's structure–property relationship, guiding the design of degradable materials.",

However, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still a subject of debate. In this study, delithiated Li0.5CoO2 is utilized as a model catalyst due to its tunable chemical states and layered structure that can facilitate reversible intercalation and deintercalation of cations. By increasing the pH to 14 using a 1.0 M CsOH solution, rapid intercalation of Cs+ cations and water molecules induce notable lattice expansion up to 9.9 Å, resulting in an order of magnitude higher OER intrinsic activity comparing to that in 0.1 M CsOH. It is hypothesized that lattice water in layered structure facilitates the dynamic intercalation and deintercalation of Cs+ cations, promoting the so-called \"electrochemical-chemical\" reaction mechanism. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate nature of surface dynamics and the redox chemistry on the catalyst/electrolyte interface during the OER.",

Instead, we propose the critical angle criterion that allows for direct prediction of compressive behaviors in various framework structures based on four structural models. According to this criterion, structures with a framework angle smaller or larger than the critical angle will exhibit negative linear compressibility or negative area compressibility (NLC/NAC). A systematic analysis reveals that the criterion accords with all previous reports. The application of the criterion on another 22 materials indicates that 20 of them will exhibit NLC along the c-axis, while the other two materials will exhibit NAC in the ab-plane, which is confirmed by the further density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The critical angle criterion will provide valuable insights and serve as a foundation for exploring materials exhibiting desired abnormal compressive behaviors.",

Selenium can undergo a series of electrochemical reactions between Se(–II) and Se(IV), resulting in a six-electron capacity per Se atom. However, existing Al–Se battery literature is inconsistent regarding the different electrochemical reactions possible, while the conditions enabling the electrochemical reduction of Se to Al2Se3 are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that this electrochemical reduction is achievable using amorphous selenium but is suppressed for crystalline selenium. We further show that the electrochemical oxidation of Se to SeCl4, which occurs at higher potentials, reduces the long-range order of crystalline Se and enables its discharge to Al2Se3. Solid-state 77Se nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements further establish that the local Se helical structures are maintained upon the loss of crystallinity.",

We also have successfully demonstrated a novel nonvolatile OFET photomemory utilizing pentacene and a C60 self-assembled monolayer (SAM), initially reaching 107 before stabilizing at 103. This highlights its effective charge retention and emission, varying with light exposure, underscoring the C60 SAM's pivotal role in modulating device performance across different lighting conditions. This high ratio is achieved through an electric field-induced charge transfer mechanism, wherein application of a gate voltage causes electrons to move from pentacene to the C60 SAM, effectively changing the device's conductive state. Additionally, the device showcases a unique photoresponsive behavior, where illumination not only augments electron transfer but also introduces complexities such as an increased off current due to the low recombination rate of electrons and holes. Despite this challenge, the ability to control memory states through both electrical and optical means marks a significant step forward, as it paves the way for multifunctional, energy-efficient memory devices.",

Here, we presented a simple strategy for constructing drug-based nanoparticles (2′F-ASO/CPT NPs) consisting of pure therapeutic molecules by utilizing 2′-fluoro-substituted antisense oligonucleotide (2′F-ASO)-mediated self-assembly with the anticancer agent camptothecin (CPT). The 2′F-substitution could enhance the intermolecular interactions between DNA and CPT through electrostatic and dispersion interactions. The resulting 2′F-ASO/CPT NPs had a high drug loading capacity and improved drug stability. 2′F-ASO/CPT NPs could specifically respond to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mRNA and inhibit the expression of P-gp, protecting CPT from P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Therefore, the synergistic anticancer effect caused by 2′F-ASO/CPT NPs could be successfully achieved.

Such a characteristic enables the continuous meter-scale production of porous frameworks with inner wall structures on the order of tens of nanometers.

The capability for self-correcting assembly not only minimizes the formation of microdefects during nanostructure construction but also significantly enhances the processability of the assembled structures.",

    "abstract": "Wound healing, a complex process involving hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling, is often hindered by factors like infection or a weakened immune response. Existing studies often neglect the crucial role of nerve regeneration. Our study introduces a novel hydrogel system using functionalized bisphosphonic acid grafted onto sodium alginate, combined with hyaluronic acid and metal ions (Fe3+ and Zn2+), to enhance wound healing in infectious environments. The interaction between bisphosphonates and Zn2+ forms a secondary network that facilitates the release of Fe3+ and Zn2+ ions. This mechanism offers broad-spectrum antibacterial action and regulates the immune environment, promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Additionally, the hydrogel supports neurogenesis and angiogenesis, essential for complete tissue repair. Enhancing nerve regeneration restores neural function and accelerates wound healing. Its injectability, self-healing properties, and biocompatibility make this hydrogel a promising candidate for advanced wound dressings, potentially reducing healing time and improving infected wound management.",

    "abstract": "Recent antimicrobial advancements highlight the pivotal role of antibiotic resistance transmission in aggravating drug-resistant bacterial infections. Inhibiting the spread of antibiotic resistance remains a significant challenge, particularly in the treatment of human infections. In this study, we developed virus-inspired lipopeptide–polymeric nanoblockers to impede transmission of antibiotic resistance from donor antibiotic-resistant bacteria to recipient bacteria. Berberine-encapsulated lipopeptide–polymeric nanoparticles (B-LPNs) effectively internalize into drug-resistant bacteria, mimic viral infection, deliver natural products, and block the spread of resistant plasmids. Our findings visually demonstrated that pretreating donor bacteria with B-LPNs preserved the antibiotic sensitivity of recipient bacteria and suppressed their growth at the minimum inhibitory concentration. In vivo antibacterial assessments further confirmed the efficacy of B-LPNs in halting antibiotic resistance transmission among Gram-negative bacteria along with satisfactory biocompatibility. This work introduces a novel nanomaterial-based strategy to address the challenges of antibiotic resistance transmission, offering safe, efficient, and clinically promising nanoblockers.",

Therefore, existing material solutions are not suitable for creating patient-specific phantoms. We present a novel and cost-effective material system (utilizing ubiquitous sodium alginate hydrogel and coconut fat) with independently and accurately tailorable CT, US, and mechanical properties. By varying the concentration of alginate, cross-linker, and coconut fat, the radiological parameters and the elastic modulus were adjusted independently in a wide range. The independence was demonstrated by creating phantoms with features hidden in US, while visible in CT imaging and vice versa. This system is particularly beneficial in resource-scarce areas since the materials are cheap (<$ 1 USD/kg) and easy to obtain, offering realistic and versatile phantoms to practice surgeries and ultimately enhance patient care.",

Additionally, the cationic transference number of related electrolytes is crucial for their performance as well as potential dendrite formation yet it is only rarely determined experimentally. Here, we study Al and Mg systems using Grignards as electrolytes for the Mg case and an ionic liquid electrolyte for the Al case. The activation energies associated with ion transport through the SEI suggest that it initially contains a high contribution from liquid pathways for the Mg case and is dense for the Al case, but becomes fully dominated by liquid pathways after a longer contact with the electrolyte. The initial effective Mg cationic transference number of the Grignards is close to zero and increases significantly after only one cyclic voltammetry cycle.",

However, this combination has been less explored. To achieve it, this study presents a sequentially dual-targeted molecular theranostic probe for combining TRT and antihypoxic activatable PDT against prostate cancer. The probe achieves prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-mediated lock-and-key targeting ability and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) hydrolysis with activated fluoro-photoacoustic signals and O2•– generation. The PSMA motif not only enhances the targeting specificity but also increases the intracellular accumulation capacity of probe and promotes more MAO-A activation. In this regard, an enhanced inhibition of tumor growth is obtained for combined activatable antihypoxic PDT and TRT in comparison to any single regimen, including the commercial 177Lu-PSMA-617, thereby demonstrating the effective antitumor effect. This study provides a potential solution for a combination of TRT and PDT for effective tumor therapy.",

However, decrease of cellular concentration of the drug, glutathione (GSH)-mediated drug inactivation, and severe toxic side effects contribute to its clinical chemotherapy failure. Cisplatin has the ability to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) production in OC, and sustained ERS can potentiate the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Herein, platinum(IV) prodrug nanoparticles (IPD NPs) are prepared as nanocarriers of isoliquiritigenin (ISL, traditional Chinese medicine) with redox-responsive degradation properties and synergistic ERS amplification for enhanced OC treatment. Notably, IPD NPs contain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which enhanced cellular uptake as well as generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby breaking redox homeostasis and further augmenting the effect of ERS. This current strategy of sustained ERS amplification for enhanced cisplatin-based chemotherapy overcomes the low cellular uptake, GSH-mediated drug detoxification, avoids the dose-dependent nephrotoxicity of cisplatin, and is promising for OC treatment.",

Herein, a series of hydrogenation reactions are conducted in a Cu catalyst-incorporated LM to demonstrate its potential as a creative medium. Compared to the effects in an aqueous system, the hydrogenation kinetics in the LM catalytic solution is enhanced by several tens of times. The excellent catalytic performance is explained by the LM participating in a special electron-donating phenomenon with the incorporated catalyst during reaction, which is seldom reported in a common medium. The proved proton coupled electron transfer (HCET) mechanism is universal in terms of organic pollutant hydrogenation, biological platform molecule regeneration, azo-dye degradation, etc. This study provides a unique perspective for innovative design of LM catalytic systems.",

The negative charge on the surface of UCNP@Glu-DMMA ensured excellent stability during blood circulation and accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequently, the combined effect of the acidic TME and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) triggered a reversal of the surface charge from negative to positive. This reversal enhanced the uptake efficiency of UCNP, leading to an increased intracellular drug concentration, deep tumor penetration, and direct nucleus delivery for the localized release of reactive oxygen species, resulting in robust DNA damage. As a result, the efficacy of PDT was significantly and precisely boosted for GGT-overexpressed tumors.

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a serious problem, owing to its severe consequences and therapeutic limitations. It leads to irreversible impairment of both motor and sensory functions, posing a challenge to recovery and imposing an immense socioeconomic burden on patients. Existing treatment strategies for SCI primarily focus on secondary injury, particularly the modulation of the immune microenvironment after SCI. Infiltrating macrophages play a crucial role in regulating inflammation around the injury site. Macrophages alter their functional phenotypes in response to various stimuli. Classically activated macrophages (M1) exacerbate SCI owing to their pro-inflammatory function, whereas alternatively activated macrophages (M2) inhibit the inflammatory response. Therefore, regulating macrophage polarization represents a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI. Several biomaterial-based strategies for repairing SCI have been developed and are constantly being updated with technological advancements owing to their ability to alleviate neuroinflammation and promote neuroregeneration. In this Review, we focus on the role of macrophages in SCI and discuss the recent research progress of biomaterials targeting macrophage-mediated inflammation for repair and regeneration following SCI. Altogether, this Review provides novel insights into the treatment of SCI.",

This paper introduces a tough 3D-printable hybrid acrylate/thiol-ene elastomer (prepared with commercially available precursors) that exhibits nearly instantaneous damage repair in the absence of external stimuli. This rapid, hydrogen bond-driven self-healing enables meaningful restoration of mechanical properties, including tensile strains up to 344% post-damage. Furthermore, structured herringbone grafts are showcased as a compelling strategy to enable cohesive failure away from healed interfaces, realizing up to 18× increases in toughness from only modest increases in interfacial surface area. Prototype soft robotic devices fabricated using vat photopolymerization demonstrate self-healing within seconds under ambient conditions and without external intervention. These results demonstrate a scalable strategy to provide real-time, autonomous functionality restoration in damaged soft devices.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasingly severe global climate change and energy crisis, the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into very valuable chemicals has been proposed as an attractive solution. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) represents a remarkably efficient pathway for reducing CO2 under mild conditions. Metal cluster-based crystalline materials (MCMs) have garnered significant interest in the area of CO2RR because of their elevated concentration of active sites, tunable backbone structures, and excellent stability. These materials enable precise control of metal valence states and charge transfer pathways, offering a variety of reduction pathways for CO2RR. Herein, we examine the utilization of MCMs in eCO2RR in recent years. We cover the fundamental principles of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the synthesis approaches for these materials, and the connection between structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, the paper delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by MCMs for enhancing CO2RR efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we aim to provide researchers with a new perspective on MCMs in the field of eCO2RR, thereby improving understanding of the relationship between structure and performance. Ultimately, this work seeks to advance the technology for eCO2RR, contributing significantly to sustainable energy production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates carbon/tin composites as anode materials for high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The material is prepared by dispersing SnO2 nanopowder in fructose solution, followed by thermal treatment under inert gas, leading to fructose carbonization and carbothermal reduction of SnO2 forming metallic Sn, confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Different thermal procedures, including a single-step with extended holding times and a two-step process, are explored; the latter separates fructose carbonization from carbothermal reduction, with the second step conducted under conventional heating conditions or via an ultrafast heating method. The composite with low carbon content exhibits a sodiation capacity of 749.2 mAh g–1 in the first cycle with a high initial cycle efficiency (ICE) of 83.2%. After 100 cycles at 37.2 mA g–1, it retains a capacity of 351 mAh g–1. The material demonstrates excellent rate capability, maintaining a capacity of 344.5 mAh g–1 at a rate of 2380 mA g–1.",

A breakthrough in the design of high-performance oxychalcogenides involves integrating and assembling multiple anionic units to maximize their functions. Following this approach, we developed La3(Ga3S3O3)(Si2O7) (LGSSO) by simultaneously incorporating [Ga3O3S6] and [Si2O7] groups. The potential of LGSSO as an IR NLO material is evident from its wide bandgap (4.82 eV, runner-up in NLO oxychalcogenides), high laser-induced damage threshold (8.7 × AgGaS2 at 1064 nm), attractive birefringence (0.122 at 546 nm), and moderate phase-matching second-harmonic generation response (1.7 × KH2PO4 at 1064 nm, 0.3 × AgGaS2 at 1910 nm). Theoretical studies indicate that the [LaS2O6] and [GaO2S2] contribute significantly to the NLO coefficient, while the [Ga3O3S6] trimers with pronounced polarizability anisotropy play a pivotal role in providing a substantial birefringence. This work offers a tangible paradigm for exploring well-performed oxychalcogenide NLO material.",

Their ecofriendly nature and high selectivity in catalysis make them promising candidates for improving chemical transformations in cell-free systems. However, their applications have been limited by their poor stability. Immobilized cascades, which can enhance activity, remain underexplored due to challenges such as ambiguous support structures and difficulties in controlling enzyme distribution. In this work, we employed NU-1510, a novel metal–organic framework (MOF) with a crystalline hierarchical pore structure, to stabilize an enzyme cascade that oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde and subsequently to acetic acid. The impact of enzyme spatial organization on the cascade kinetics was further investigated thanks to the crystalline hierarchical pore structure of the MOF host. These findings pave the way for the design of advanced biocatalytic systems with improved efficiency and durability, potentially transforming applications in sustainable chemical manufacturing and energy conversion.",

Current methods focus on broadly sequestering all small molecules but are unable to address specific small molecules of interest. Additionally, these procedures require large amounts of resources, such as electricity and pressure. We propose to address this challenge through the use of DNA aptamer-functionalized ultrafiltration membranes. To demonstrate this approach, we developed an aptamer-functionalized membrane that sequesters and removes the small-molecule contaminant bisphenol A (BPA) from water. We show that BPA is depleted and that the membranes can be regenerated for multiple uses, which can allow for recovery of the small molecule when desired. Aptamers can be selected for a wide variety of target small molecules, making this approach highly generalizable beyond our initial demonstration. Together, this research offers a promising solution to improving the efficacy of small molecule removal and recovery from aqueous matrices.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic microbubbles (MBs) are an important class of biomaterials that play an increasingly prominent role in advanced applications such as contrast and super-resolution imaging, sonoporation, drug delivery, microrobotics, and biosensors. The ability to control and regulate acoustic cavitation of MBs by ultrasound (US) pulses is fundamental to achieve these applications. However, most MBs are coated with a soft shell that may undergo alteration (e.g., rupture or dissolution) under insonification and result in unintended acoustic responses. This work introduces a system of stable polymeric caged MBs in which the gas core is encapsulated within a rigid but nanoporous shell, so that their acoustic response is regulated by both shell compressibility and metastructure (i.e., porosity), thus permitting high control over their cavitation behaviors via pulse manipulation. These caged MBs are fabricated via a method of interfacial nanoprecipitation. Fabrication parameters can be varied to manipulate shell elasticity and porosity and subsequently control a wide range of acoustic properties such as tuning resonance frequency, controlling modes of nonlinear cavitation. Furthermore, the cavitation of caged MBs can be manipulated to develop tunable acoustic pressure sensors. These caged MBs offer insight of the acoustic–material relationship to design acoustic biomaterials for US-guided diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.",

However, the stability of blue perovskite devices is lacking, primarily because of the halide segregation during operation that degrades the underlying perovskite structure. Saturated and stable blue emission was accomplished with a rational materials blend of a mixed halide perovskite, polymer electrolytes, and a lithium salt that selectively suppressed perovskite ion motion while facilitating the transport of the salt additive. This approach produced blue electroluminescence peaked at 464 nm that surpassed standard benchmarks with a luminance maximum of 540 cd/m2 and stable operation under constant current driving. The role of the polymer and salt additives was explored by photoluminescence, electroluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy studies. Concerning the device, the salt ions improve electrical double layer formation and selectively move in place of the perovskite ions, while the polymers improve the uniformity and smoothness of the films. Fundamentally, each component is shown to contribute to the suppression of halide segregation for highly stable electroluminescence.",

Creating materials that mimic the hierarchical structure and surface chemistry of lotus leaves requires multistep processes that are impractical for the mass production of nonwettable products. Superhydrophobic surfaces have been created using graphene. However, graphene sheets obtained through graphite exfoliation or deposition on substrates are not superhydrophobic and require additional processes to achieve lotus-like water repellency. In this work, we show that graphene produced in the gas phase is inherently superhydrophobic. Gas-phase-synthesized graphene (GSG) and lotus leaves have fundamentally different structures, yet water droplets on both materials exhibit comparable contact angles, roll-off angles, and bouncing characteristics. Furthermore, hydrophilic surfaces become superhydrophobic when covered with GSG. The substrate-free synthesis of GSG is straightforward and sustainable, which could enable the manufacturing of a diverse range of water-repellent technologies.",

    "abstract": "The organic interlayer is a crucial part in organic spin valves (OSVs), and its molecular structure has an important effect on the device performance. In this work, we utilized conjugated polymers based on isoindigo derivatives (PIID-TVTCN, PAIID-TVTCN, and PFIID-TVTCN) to fabricate OSVs and studied the dependence of the performance on the polymer structure. Positive magnetoresistance (MR) was obtained in OSVs with 40 nm polymeric thin films. Under the same conditions, the introduction of a pyridine nitrogen into the conjugated skeleton (PAIID-TVTCN) induced an increased MR value, while fluorine substitution in the isoindigo unit resulted in no change in MR. The relationship between structure and performance was further clarified. However, the MR was negative in OSVs with 25 nm polymeric thin films but flipped to positive when an AlOx film was inserted under the Co electrode. Thus, the negative MR was attributed to a synergistic effect between tunneling transport and interfacial coupling. The results highlight the effects of the polymer structure and thickness as well as the insertion of a layer of AlOx on the performance of OSVs and are also the first for this kind of multidimensional functionalized modulation of MR in polymeric-based OSVs.",

This study reports a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP strong acceptor)-based polymer with a dichlorinated dithienylethene (ClTVT) weak donor unit sequentially doped with solutions of varied FeCl3 concentrations as a p-n switchable thermoelectric. Polymer films doped with dilute and moderate FeCl3 solution concentrations (up to 40 mmol/L) exhibit positive (ca. 100 μV/K) and negative (ca. tens of μ/K) Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities of 80 and 130 S cm–1, respectively. After rinsing, the conductivity increases to 170 S cm–1 for both p-type and n-type, with Seebeck coefficients slightly more positive/less negative and Seebeck voltage time evolution consistent with their being completely electronic. The power factor of 15 μW/m K2 was unusually high for a p-to-n inversion material. However, polymer films doped with a high-concentration FeCl3 solution (50 mmol/L) without rinsing show a high composite Seebeck coefficient of −2400 μV K–1. We propose that this high Seebeck coefficient arises from a contribution of Cl- ion thermodiffusion in a near-surface layer. Supporting evidence for this is an analogous, even higher negative Seebeck coefficient obtained from the much less conjugated/conductive polymer poly(p-phenylene oxide) (PPO) on which FeCl3 was applied to form a layer that was removed on rinsing.",

Sucrose esters (SEs) are found to have tremendous potential applications in siRNA delivery because of their biocompatibility and low toxicity. However, the esterification of sucrose yields complex mixtures that greatly limit their progress in this field. We synthesized a series of novel sucrose monoester-based cationic lipids (SECLs) by using 1′,4,6′-trichlorogalactosucrose (TGS) to achieve monoesterification of sucrose. SECL-based liposomes formed from these lipids and colipids [dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) or cholesterol (Chol)] could effectively condense genes into nanocomplexes, which exhibited significantly higher uptake rates and gene silencing efficiency than 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) liposome. Furthermore, SECL-based liposomes containing cholesterol-mediated IGF-1R siRNA delivery could inhibit tumor growth by the downregulation of Bcl-2 and the upregulation of Bax. Most importantly, these liposomes displayed low cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo because they could be degraded under tumor acidic pH environments. Our study establishes a novel method for the synthesis of SEs from TGS and demonstrates the applicability of SECLs for gene delivery with the potential for clinical therapy.",

This work establishes an incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)-based synthesis method for preparing sub-3 nm Pt/C catalysts with a loading up to 60 wt %. A two-step reduction strategy involving PtClx/C intermediates (PtClx/C-IMD) has been developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional IWI method in controlling the size of PtNPs at ultrahigh loadings. We found that (1) the formation of PtNPs from PtClx/C-IMD differs significantly from that of the simple H2PtCl6/C precursor, as PtClx/C-IMD can be converted to Pt/C at an ultralow temperature of 100 °C, which is 50 °C lower than H2PtCl6/C. (2) The size of PtNPs is primarily determined during the low-temperature formation stage rather than during high-temperature postsintering. Furthermore, a fuel cell manufacturer has demonstrated that the as-prepared 60% Pt/C catalyst, when used in a single H2-air fuel cell, achieves a high power density of 1.03 W/cm2 at 0.65 V with a low Pt loading of 0.2 mg/cm2, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial 60% Pt/C.

    "abstract": "The photostability of lead halide perovskites is an important criterion for their utilization in light harvesting applications. Colloidal two-dimensional mixed halide perovskites offer a convenient approach to probe photoinduced transformations using spectroscopy tools. We employed suspensions of colloidal 2D methylammonium lead halide perovskite platelets with butylammonium and octylammonium as organic spacer cations. Upon irradiation of the mixed halide perovskite (BAOAMAPb2(Br3.5I3.5)) colloidal platelet suspension, we observe a phase transformation, as seen from the formation of bromide rich domains (BAOAMAPb2Br7) and an iodide complex (PbI3–). Unlike in the case of 3D mixed halide films, we did not observe the formation of iodide rich domains as part of the photoinduced phase segregation process. Instead, we observed the dissociation of the BAOAMAPb2I7 to form an iodide complex, PbI3–. Interestingly, this photoinduced phase transformation was reversible, as the products which were confined in the colloidal core restored the original mixed halide phase upon storage in dark. The spectroscopic measurements that characterize excited states of different colloidal methylammonium lead halide perovskites and kinetics of photoinduced transformation and their dark recovery are presented. These new phototransformations of colloidal perovskite platelets provide new insights into the processes that dictate their overall photostability.",

Systematic studies investigating the effect of different types of defects, which occur under mechanical strain, on the electrical stability of the devices are required. However, there are not many related studies. In this study, we investigate strain-induced hysteresis caused by the formation of wrinkles in a conjugated polymer used in organic thin-film transistors. Wrinkles are formed by stretched poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and successfully controlled by the strain applied to PDMS. Based on the electrical behavior, including drain current-gate bias(ID–VG) hysteresis, the results reveal that surface wrinkles affect the density of electron and hole trap sites. This behavior is phenomenologically analyzed by using atomic force microscopy. Subsequently, a novel band diagram model is developed by systematically controlling the wrinkle density. The findings provide new insights into the electrical reliability characteristics of next-generation nanoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Epitaxial single-crystal semiconductors, serving as the backbone of electronic devices, are the cornerstones of modern electronics. Solution-processable organic semiconductors provide the potential for the epitaxial growth of their single crystals using low-cost and scale-up solution-based methods. However, current epitaxy methods for the growth of organic semiconducting single crystals (OSSCs) are plagued by limited scalability and controllability, impeding their integration into large-area electronic platforms. Here, we report a lateral homoepitaxy growth method that can be compatible with scalable solution printing techniques, thus obtaining centimeter-scale OSSC arrays. We engineer a selective wettability area to enable the formation of well-aligned seed crystals and unlock a stable lateral homoepitaxy epitaxy process. Using this approach, we achieve purely a-axis oriented 2,7-dioctyl[1]-benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8–BTBT) OSSC arrays with high-uniformity morphology and low trap carrier density of 2.8 × 1017 cm–3 eV–1. Leveraging these superiorities, 100 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) over a centimeter scale developed by the OSSC arrays exhibit a 520% improved average mobility of 10.4 cm2 V–1 s–1 and a low 14.6% variation in carrier mobility. Our approach will lay a strong foundation for OSSCs to fit into the manufacturing of large-area organic single-crystal electronics.",

With the design of advanced electrolytes, promising CEs (∼99.5%) have been shown in Cu | Li cells. However, the impact of cathode materials and their operating conditions in the cells on the CE has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we compare the CE of Li metal in Cu | Li cells and Cu | LiNi1–x–yMnxCoyO2 cells with different Ni contents. We also evaluate the CE with different cutoff charge voltages (4.4 and 4.6 V). The cathode as well as increasing Ni content or cutoff voltage all negatively impact the Li CE in advanced electrolytes. The chemical crossover from the cathode to the anode alters the composition of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the surface of Li metal. The crossed over sulfur and nitrogen species and the formation of less inorganic components like LiF in the Li SEI could lead to inferior Li CE. This study highlights the importance of considering the compatibility of advanced electrolytes both with Li metal and cathodes for LMBs.",

We show that capping SrBrF can passivate surface carrier traps and improve the photoluminescence quantum yields of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals from 43.3% to 89.0%, showing about a 28-fold improvement in thermal stability (at 363 K) and exceptional photostability under long-term ultraviolet exposure (at 365 nm).

Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) studies gave compelling evidence of inhibited halogen ion migration in CsPbBr3/SrBrF PNC-LEDs due to the capping of SrBrF nanocrystals.

Furthermore, the HER activity of RuIn NPs was comparable to that of commercial Pt catalysts. At a current density of 10 mA cm–2, RuIn NPs displayed a lower overpotential of 30.7 mV compared to monometallic fcc Ru NPs (57.8 mV) and commercial Pt NPs/C (34.1 mV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis revealed charge transfer from In to Ru in RuIn NPs.

Treatment of an easily synthesized \"template\" ZIF (such as ZIF-8) with an acid gas (humid SO2) allows controlled demolition of metal-linker coordination bonds, while preserving overall crystal topology. The partially demolished crystals are then reconstructed into highly crystalline mixed-linker ZIFs with unique characteristics by insertion of different linkers that displace the damaged linkers. One illustration shows the synthesis of a series of mixed-linker ZIFs containing benzimidazole linkers that show entirely different gate-opening and diffusion characteristics from ZIFs of the same composition prepared by direct crystallization. Also shown is the synthesis of new mixed-linker SOD-topology ZIFs containing bulky halobenzimidazole and alkylbenzimidazole linkers, which are very difficult to synthesize by other methods. The present method is seen to considerably reduce thermodynamic or kinetic barriers for replacement and insertion of linkers into ZIF topologies.",

However, the instability of typical 2D materials (for instance, black phosphorus (BP)) places restrictions on their practical applications. It is of great importance to develop effective sealing materials to protect these unstable but promising 2D materials. Herein, we develop a highly efficient and removable graphene-seal-wrap (GSW) based on large-area grain-boundary-free graphene films. As a proof of concept, the air- and moisture-sensitive BP was successfully protected by the as-developed GSW. The results reveal that BP can remain stable even under high humidity conditions for up to 18 days, while the bare ones are easily oxidized. More importantly, the graphene sealing layer can be facilely removed without affecting the underlying BP surface, making it an ideal sealing film. This GSW can promptly provide an air- and moisture-proof film for handling unstable 2D materials, paving an avenue for their device fabrication and practical applications.",

In this work, a series of thiophene and selenophene-based conjugated polymers with similar molecular weight and low dispersity were synthesized and the gelation conditions of these polymers were studied. The electrical performance of both thin and bulk films of these conjugated polymer gels were investigated. Blade-coated gels that form the highest quality films can achieve a similar charge carrier mobility as a spin coated sample, showing that gels are indeed promising electronic materials. The most promising gels were studied as a stretchable device. The initial application of strain appears to lead to the lower mobility; however, the device stabilizes and retains the same mobility from 18% to 40% strain. Finally, a new cycle-doping method was developed to successfully dope the bulk gels to yield conductive films. This method allows one to monitor the changes in conductivity as a function of doping to ultimately achieve the highest conductivity. The cycle-doping method appears to be superior to the commonly used dip-doping method. Overall this work expands on the types of conjugated polymers gels that are useful for electronics, stretchable electronics, and conductive materials.",

Metal oxide semiconductors, such as TiO2, BiVO4, and Fe2O3, are widely used as front photoanode in tandem cells due to their high photovoltage, light transmittance, and excellent stability in aqueous solutions as well as their low cost. However, connecting a photoanode with a photocathode directly with the same area will lead to power mismatch due to the lower photocurrent density of the photoanode side. This Letter describes a basic computational model to determine the optimal structure of a tandem cell composed of multiple photoanodes and a photocathode by considering the photocurrent density and the cost of per-unit area of photoanodes. TiO2, BiVO4, and Fe2O3 are used to prove the feasibility of this computational model. In addition, the fill factor of output power in tandem cell is obtained to evaluate whether the power of photoanode and photocathode is appropriately matched. The optimal structure of multiphotoanode is a two-layer TiO2||BiVO4 in an equal area, which is predicted by this computational model and confirmed by experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Grain boundaries (GBs) are important structural defects that have significant influence on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, reports on GBs in lower-symmetry T″-structure TMDs, especially on their local electronic structures, are rare. Here, we report a systematic study of intrinsic coherent GBs in monolayer ReSe2, a representative T″-structure TMD with anisotropy and intriguing electrical properties, via a combination of atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging and first-principles calculations. These coherent GBs feature a coherent Se sublattice and unchanged Re–Se (and Se–Re) local coordination. Based on the saturation of the Re–Re bond, the GBs are divided into three categories: those with saturated Re–Re bonds (3 Re–Re bonds per Re atom), denoted as α-GBs; those with truncated Re4 chains but intact Re4 clusters (β-GBs); and those with broken Re4 clusters (γ-GBs). The intact configurations of the α-GBs enable them to form easily, and they possess semiconductor characteristics inherited from the pristine ReSe2 monolayer. Interestingly, the introduction of both β-GBs and γ-GBs leads to the emergence of local magnetic moment, arising from the Re 5dxz atomic orbitals around the boundaries. Moreover, the GBs with broken Re–Re bonds (β- and γ-GBs) exhibit subtle differences in spin-polarized in-gap states, demonstrating the strong dependency of the electronic properties on the precise atomic structure of the GBs. These results are of fundamental importance in understanding lower-symmetry TMDs and the structure–property relationships in two-dimensional materials.",

The fluorescence emission of the guest can be significantly enhanced after oligomerization, which is likely due to the suppressed nonemissive interaction between the oligomerized molecules in the nanospace and the MOF wall.

The biomineralized nanoparticles are MnO2 mineralized bionanoparticles consisting of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Overexpressed glutathione in cancer cells dissolves the MnO2 outer layer and induces EGCG autoxidation to elevate O2–· and H2O2 levels. Meanwhile, the generated Mn2+ catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 into ·OH.

This layering of crystalline and amorphous regions is characterized by the so-called \"long period\" which can be measured with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The weak scattering contrast between amorphous and crystalline phases generally requires SAXS measurement of bulk powder samples. Here, we show that by utilizing polarized tender X-rays tuned to the sulfur K-edge, strong contrast between amorphous and crystalline phases can be generated allowing for the long period of thin film P3HT samples to be easily observed. Furthermore, we show that the contrast generated results from differences in orientational order in the amorphous and crystalline regions.

    "abstract": "Organic solid luminescent materials bearing spectral tunability are receiving growing attention because of their enormous potential in the construction of stimulation-responsive smart materials. However, current methods, usually relying on polymer films or crystal aggregates, face challenges in fluorescence performance or crystallized controllability. In this work, we creatively report the use of surface-cross-linked micelles (SCMs), spatial confinement systems, to manipulate the multicolor fluorescence in the solid state by encapsulating a dihydrophenazine-based fluorophore (DPAC). DPAC can generate an intrinsic bent-to-planar configuration transformation with blue and orange-red fluorescence, respectively, and their intensity ratios strongly depend on different confined spaces provided by SCMs, thus enabling spectra-tunable fluorescence across blue to red regions. Interestingly, these self-assembly materials display the thermoresponsive peculiarities, which allow practical applications in intricate information encryption and elaborate logic circuit. Our strategy highlights the significance of the micelle-confined system that encloses the matched fluorophore as a tool to develop spectra-tunable and stimulus-responsive solid luminescent materials.",

Outstanding optoelectronic properties make them ideal materials for light-emitting and harvesting applications. Despite these advantages, they suffer from serious phase instability and remain highly sensitive to the external parameters. These parameters are not random and can be well correlated with the nature of materials. In many cases, the phase sensitivity can be used for different applications. Hence, understanding the chemistry behind this transformation is important to understand their synthesis, processing, and device fabrication. Considering its importance, this most critical issue of the phase sensitivity of perovskite nanocrystals is elaborated and correlated with their synthesis, purification, and harvesting.

Herein we demonstrate the role of hydrophilic hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) to direct the lateral recombination of dipeptide-protected Au NCs (Ac-CG-Au NCs) 1-D assemblies. HP-β-CD can shorten the distance between single NCs and strengthen intercluster interactions, which may further increase the stability of the NCs assemblies and promote the charge transfer efficiency, contributing to a 2-fold larger PL quantum yield than for Ac-CG-Au NCs. By virtue of the pH-sensitive and morphology-dependent PL emission in an acidic environment, the 1-D NCs assemblies can be applied for the selective labeling of lysosomes, the acidic organelles in HeLa cells, making them a candidate tool for subcellular trafficking observation.",

However, most NFA-based ternary blends are constructed using the strategies developed for polymer–fullerene systems, and intrinsic properties of these NFAs have been overlooked when designing a ternary organic solar cell. Here, using a new NFA 2,2′-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl) bis(methaneylylidene)) bis(1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione), referred to IDID, as the third component, we observed the appearance of a polymorph of IDID when it was introduced into a PTQ10: PC61BM binary blend and this ternary blend solar cell showed a significant improvement in efficiency from 3.38% to 6.04%. This relative increase (with respect to the best binary cell) is nearly 80% which is the highest among all the reported organic ternary blends to the best of our knowledge. Specifically, IDID was found to be nucleated by the host polymer donor PTQ10 under the assistance of the processing solvent to form a distinct polymorph, as proven by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and supported by surface energy measurements. More interestingly, IDID, as a third component in the PTQ10: PC61BM system, was found to outperform the structurally similar NFA IDIC, which only boosted the efficiency from 3.38% to 3.55% in ternary polymer solar cells. This work highlights polymer-mediated polymorphism in NFAs as an important consideration in selection of components for and the optimization of ternary organic solar cells.",

Herein, persistent NIR-emitting fibers have been fabricated by incorporating long-lasting phosphorescent phosphor and fluorescent Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) into the regenerated silk fibroin (SF)-based core–sheath fibers. Green-emitting phosphor was introduced into the fiber core during coaxial wet spinning, while various layers of QDs emissive in NIR range were deposited on the fiber surface. A double-layered hollow structure was obtained in these fibers with improved surface uniformity. Fluorescence spectrometry confirmed that the green emission of the embedded phosphors (i.e. 492 nm) was absorbed by the surface Ag2S layer to give continuous NIR emission. Up to 13.5 % of the 993 nm NIR radiation passed through porcine epidermis of 0.25 mm thickness.

In this work, we report a series of room-temperature-stable atropisomeric conjugated diimides, Syn-NDI and Anti-NDI based on 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimides (NDIs) as well as Syn-PDI and Anti-PDI based on 3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimides (PDIs). For these two pairs of atropisomers, the Syn and Anti conformers can be interconverted when they are in heated solution, whereas in the solid state, only the Syn conformers can converted to Anti conformers when thermally annealed. This feature can be applied to realize thermally responsive organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Remarkably, when thermally annealed at a certain temperature, the Syn atropisomers can be fast converted to their respective Anti ones, and OFETs originally based on the Syn semiconductors show a dramatic improvement in electron mobility. For OFETs originally based on Syn-NDI, a 100-fold improvement in electron mobility is recorded when Syn-NDI was converted to Anti-NDI, while for OFETs originally based on Syn-PDI, a 5000-fold improvement in electron mobility is recorded when Syn-PDI was converted to Anti-PDI. In contrast, thermal annealing is found to have a negligible effect for OFETs based on Anti semiconductors, with the electron mobility on the same order of magnitude for all Anti semiconductor devices. This is the first time that the atropisomerism has been exploited in organic semiconductors, demonstrating great potential for stimuli-responsive devices.",

The ability of enzymes to efficiently bind substrates in aqueous environments and spontaneously release products upon reaction completion has inspired the development of synthetic catalysts (enzyme mimetics) based on well-organized supramolecular nanomaterials. The amphiphilicity of these materials can be exploited to dissolve hydrophobic substrates in polar solvents and gather such substrates in the hydrophobic confined spaces of supramolecular cavities. The result is high local concentrations of substrates, which allows organic reactions to proceed in polar solvent environments. Supramolecular materials can also reversibly change their functions and structures in response to external stimuli such as temperature, solvents, and guest molecules to realize the on/off switching of supramolecular catalyst-promoted reactions. In this Perspective, we introduce supramolecular materials produced by the self-assembly of aromatic amphiphiles and discuss their applications as catalysts for various reactions in polar solvents.

Meanwhile, the methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive is used to regulate the crystallization process and promote 2D/3D phase segregation in perovskite layer, endowing the film with a significantly improved photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) due to both the desired energy funneling from the 2D phase to the 3D phase and the trap passivation brought by the 2D phase.

To prevent such infections, this study aims to establish an innovative therapeutic method, double-action disinfection, realized using a silk fibroin gauze. The ideal requirement for double-action disinfection is the co-exhibition of an adhered occlusive barrier and elution-based biochemical activity in a single material. To this end, the intrinsic structure of the silk fibroin gauze is designed as a type I conformation. Thus, the silk fibroin gauze exhibits an adhesive force (shear stress ≈ 51.8 kPa) larger than that of commercial tissue adhesives. Simultaneously, the drug-elution rate from the silk fibroin gauze is 3.46 mg cm–3 min–1/2, enabling dosage comparable to that of existing drug-eluting therapeutic strategies. The silk fibroin gauze promotes double-action disinfection of the exploratory laparotomy site and prevents surgical-site-infection-associated complications in vivo, leading to the hopeful prognosis of the inflammatory disease without surgical site infection. Furthermore, synergy with antibiotics significantly alleviates the effect of severe disease, which demonstrates the clinical potential of the proposed therapeutic method.",

    "abstract": "On-demand drug-delivery platforms can provide precise control over the timing and amount of drug delivered using external stimuli. Such platforms enable customizable release patterns and enhance therapeutic efficacy by anticipatorily, repeatedly, and dependably controlling the timing, amount, and location of drug release. Herein, we propose an innovative on-demand drug release platform based on electrospun nanofibers (NFs) with a near-infrared (NIR)-triggered glass transition switch to simplify protocols and improve the currently available thermoresponsive nanocarrier formulations. The gold nanorods (GNRs) present in NFs generate heat when exposed to NIR radiation due to the plasmon resonance effect as the GNRs are absorbed in the range of the NIR spectrum. In this investigation, poly-l-lactic acid, a polymer with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 53–58 °C, was used to create electrospun NFs containing GNRs and camptothecin. Upon NIR irradiation, the increase in temperature above the Tg by the GNRs caused physical changes in the NFs, which ensured that the drug was released in a controlled manner. This study demonstrates a promising platform for safely delivering drugs and controlling drug release to treat cancer as well as other challenging diseases.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying water and salt transport properties in polyamide is of growing importance as the use of reverse osmosis membranes grows in many industries. Here, using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we measure the translational diffusion coefficients using pulsed-field gradient NMR, examine ion dynamics with NMR relaxometry, and determine the activation energy barriers of hydrogen and sodium ions in ion-exchanged polyamide using variable-temperature NMR. We identify two predominant diffusion components within the spectra associated with bound and unbound hydrogen and sodium ions. We show that the diffusion coefficient of the bound hydrogen ions decreases by ∼50% while the unbound hydrogen diffusion coefficient remains constant as the salinity of the mixture doubles. Conversely, the bound sodium diffusion coefficient remained constant while the unbound sodium diffusion coefficient decreased by ∼40% as the salinity of the mixture doubled. Through examining the spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) we also report the associated activation energy for sodium and hydrogen. We believe these molecular-scale measurements can aid in extending physics-based models of salt and water transport in high-pressure reverse osmosis applications.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we report the synthesis of a dendritic polyphenol characterized by a high glass transition temperature (Tg), comparable to that of poly(4-hydroxystyrene). Although the molecule (DP8) was designed to have a molecular weight as low as 1169 g/mol with eight hydroxyl groups, it exhibited a Tg of ca. 160 °C along with a stable amorphous nature when prepared from the trityl chloride structural motif. The beneficial effect of its high Tg was revealed when DP8 was converted to an acid-labile derivative, DP8-tBOC, with tert-butoxycarbonyl (tBOC) protective moieties. Compared to its smaller counterpart based on six hydroxyl units, DP8-tBOC could survive at higher temperatures, with a slower acid diffusion rate under proton injection conditions. These characteristics enabled the formation of 130 nm thick, 50 nm wide patterns in a lithographic experiment using a focused electron beam. As a versatile building block, DP8 was also derivatized into a fluoroalkylated molecule, DP8-PPVE, which produced 50 nm-sized features under electron-beam lithographic conditions. These results demonstrate the strong potential of the low-molecular-weight, high-Tg DP8 molecule as an extreme UV resist platform for high-resolution microlithography.",

This is because the atomic thickness and structural sensitivity of 2D material make it extremely challenging to introduce multiple luminescent centers into it without structural collapse. Here, for the first time, we have designed a 2D inorganic framework with a wide bandgap and easily substitutable sites to embed self-transforming luminescence centers nondestructively and achieved multicolor emissions spanning from green to orange.

    "abstract": "Strut-based cellular structures have gained remarkable attention in recent years due to their improved strength-to-weight ratio, energy absorption abilities, and heat transfer properties. A key feature of cellular structures employed in modern infrastructure and devices is a symmetric configuration with repeating unit cells. This periodic design makes fabrication more feasible for next-generation aerospace and biomedical materials. However, such a design with brittle constituents often undergoes a sudden and catastrophic failure as all unit cells along a fracture surface tend to fail simultaneously at a critical loading condition. In this paper, we propose an elegant solution to achieve progressive failure by adjusting the diameter of each strut to create asymmetric or irregular cellular structures. Finite element simulations are conducted and validated by comparing with experiments on additively manufactured samples. Designs are then categorized into three failure modes and the relationship between the failure modes and the stress–strain curves are analyzed. Lastly, simulation-based Bayesian optimization is applied to design the structures with a more distributed stress field before failure and therefore improve their strength and energy absorption capabilities. Results show that the proposed designs fail at the boundaries and the cracks grow locally without penetrating through the entire structure, leading to more progressive failure. This research proposes novel cellular structures via symmetry breaking to achieve structures with promising manufacturability and damage-tolerant failure, greatly broadening their applications.",

In past studies, however, interface dipole layers were generally formed using organic self-assembled monolayers or polyelectrolytes, which raises concerns about intrinsic stability. Meanwhile, perovskites' substrate-dependent electronic properties question the apparent correlation between the oxide's work function and the built-in voltage. In this work, we propose an interface dipole layer based on solution-processable metal halides, which increases the built-in voltage of the n–i–p diode by simultaneously reducing the electron transport layer's work function and strengthening the n-type characteristics of the perovskite absorber. The n–i–p-structured PSCs with the SbX3 dipole layer achieve substantially enhanced VOC (1.171 V) and power conversion efficiency (23.11%). Further experiments and calculations confirm that the proposed dipole model can explain the VOC enhancement qualitatively and quantitatively.",

Nevertheless, some fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA)-based organic bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) exhibit decent molecular growth modes, which may be of merit for the generation of remarkable AOMR and heretofore uninvestigated. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the out-of-plane and in-plane AOMR with 2-fold symmetry in the ambient condition for prototypical organic blends such as PM6:Y6 and PM6:IT-4F. The phenomena cannot be equally observed in a conventional fullerene-based organic BHJ. Based on our microscopically theoretical models for the analyses of the effect, we postulate that AOMR originate from an interplay of the anisotropic Δg factor and hyperfine field (HF) induced spin mixing mechanism. We believe that a complete understanding of AOMR in the organic BHJ system opens a new avenue for the development of magnetic navigations and sensors.",

The structure in which the semimetal 1T′ (or Td) phase electrode contacts the semiconductor 2H phase channel is considered an elegant solution for high-performance two-dimensional (2D) circuits because it achieves low contact resistance. However, most of the 2D metal–semiconductor structures for large-area integration use a two-step growth process, which puts forward high requirements for the secondary growth compatibility of the material. Here, we develop a method for the stable synthesis of the metallic MoxW1–xTe2 (0 < x < 1) by W-triggered spatial phase engineering, and we further obtain a large-area MoxW1–xTe2/2H-MoTe2 in-plane metal–semiconductor structure by one-step tellurization of a MoW/Mo periodic structure. Due to the unique 2D in-plane epitaxial mechanism of the phase transition from 1T′ to 2H, the highly crystalline semiconductor 2H-MoTe2 squeezes between two metallic MoxW1–xTe2 electrodes and forms a seamless coplanar contacted channel; thus, the fabricated field-effect transistors exhibit good electrical characteristics. In addition, large-area 2D metal–semiconductor heterostructure arrays can be transferred onto flexible substrates, showing promising applications in flexible electronics. Herein, one-step synthesis of large-area 2D in-plane metal–semiconductor arrays opens up new possibilities for future integrated high-performance logic circuits.",

More than 3% of global energy demand is already met by solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, and this number is only going to increase. However, environmental factors such as weather can significantly impact the efficiency and lifetime of PV modules. In dry and sandy climates, such as the Middle East, the main problem is mitigating the effects of high temperatures and dust. Functional-coating-based, self-cleaning technology is the most effective approach to dust mitigation (DM) in the literature. However, no cost analysis has been done to compare the practicality of such technologies with conventional methods such as manual cleaning and tractor-mounted brush cleaning. In this work, we presented a detailed techno-economic analysis of three different DM approaches using outdoor testing data from installations in Rumah, Saudi Arabia, and Inner Mongolia, China. The results show that a durable superhydrophilic (SPhi) transparent coating is the most economical way to clean solar panels. It results in a 3% increase in annual generated power compared to an uncoated, regularly cleaned solar farm. The return on investment is also only 15 months at a PV electricity-selling price of 0.07 USD/kWh using a standard levelized cost of energy (LCOE) calculation.",

We use hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with 3-fold symmetry as the model system in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, demonstrating the atomic-layer Koch snowflake arises from the complex coupling of lattice symmetry and the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang interaction of the edge-atomic reacting-diffusion process.

In this study, we prepared an activatable plasmonic theranostics system based on silica-carried ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (SiO2@usAu NPs). The SiO2@usAu NPs underwent an Ostwald ripening process in response to the overexpressed H2O2 in the microenvironment. A red shift in the ultraviolet–visible light (UV-vis) absorption spectrum was observed after the Ostwald redox reaction, transitioning from the UV-vis to near-infrared (IR) region, accompanied by an augmentation in the size of the gold nanoparticles. With the H2O2-activated characteristics, SiO2@usAu NPs are considered to be a suitable responsive photoacoustic imaging contrast agent. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrate that the SiO2@usAu NPs showed good in vivo photoacoustic imaging performance both in the 4T1 tumor model and the LPS-induced peritonitis model, suggesting that it could be used as a responsive photoacoustic imaging contrast agent for noninvasive detection and diagnosis of diseases in vivo, including cancers and inflammation-related diseases with exceptional sensitivity and precision.

    "abstract": "Human multisensory neurons integrate multiple sensory information obtained from the external environment for precise interpretation of an event. Inspired by biological multisensory integration/multiplexing behavior, an artificial multimodal integration system capable of emulating the perception of discomfort based on the integration of multiple sensory signals is presented. The system utilizes a sensory ring oscillator that concisely and efficiently integrates thermosensory and hygrosensory signals from artificial receptors into voltage pulses whose amplitude and frequency reflect the two individual sensory signals. Subsequently, a synaptic transistor translates voltage pulses into a postsynaptic current, which exhibits a high correlation with the calculated humidex. Finally, the feasibility of the artificial multimodal integration system is successfully demonstrated using light-emitting diode discomfort indicators, suggesting that the proposed system can act as a foundation for future studies pertaining to neuromorphic perception and complex neurorobotics.",

    "abstract": "Simulations are essential to accelerate the discovery of new materials and to gain full understanding of known ones. Although hard to realize experimentally, periodic boundary conditions are omnipresent in material simulations. In this work, we introduce ROBIN (recursive open boundary and interfaces), the first method allowing open boundary conditions in material and interface modeling. The computational costs are limited to solving quantum properties in a focus area that allows explicitly discretizing millions of atoms in real space and to consider virtually any type of environment (be it periodic, regular, or random). The impact of the periodicity assumption is assessed in detail with silicon dopants in graphene. Graphene was confirmed to produce a band gap with periodic substitution of 3% carbon with silicon in agreement with published periodic boundary condition calculations. Instead, 3% randomly distributed silicon in graphene only shifts the energy spectrum. The predicted shift agrees quantitatively with published experimental data. Key insight of this assessment is, assuming periodicity elevates a small perturbation of a periodic cell into a strong impact on the material property prediction. Periodic boundary conditions can be applied on truly periodic systems only. More general systems should apply an open boundary method for reliable predictions.",

Here, we successfully demonstrated MF-based single-crystalline microdevice arrays using a lithography-compatible, solution-processed strategy that can avoid the above-mentioned obstacles at one time, i.e., dewetting-assisted patterning crystallization strategy. As a protype, uniform and well-aligned single-crystalline thin-film arrays of multiaxial MF [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4 ([3-O-Q]ClO4) are prepared. Owing to the well-aligned crystallographic orientation and polarization direction, the obtained single-crystalline nonvolatile memory (NVM) arrays can exhibit an ultralow operating voltage of ∼1.6 V and long endurance cycles of 106, which are superior to other organic NVM devices. This work implies a promising route to high-density single-crystalline memory arrays for data storage, especially for low-cost flexible electronics.",

To recognize and process voice information, precise sound signal analysis is required by using an envelope detector that can convert the oscillating voice signal to the enveloped signal. In this work, we present a platinum/molybdenum disulfide (Pt/MoS2) back-to-back (BTB) diodes architecture that, only with a single-device unit, can function as a frequency detector and an envelope detector. Benefiting from electrostatic control of the doping level of the MoS2 channel, the device exhibited both high and low resistance–capacitance delay operation (under floating and high gate voltage conditions) toward multidemodulator without any loop filter circuit components. We thus believe that our gate tunable BTB diodes circuit would be a promising key technique toward the high-integration and low-power applications for future mobile electronics.",

While fullerene-based BHJs are relatively well understood structurally, especially when blends with a flexible-chain donor are employed, donor: non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) blends are more challenging to elucidate. The reason is that NFAs often display different polymorphs; moreover, their glassy states can be complex. Focusing on blends of the widely investigated donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), and the prototype NFA, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), we reveal here the coexistence of two glassy phases: a molecularly intermixed and an ITIC-rich one. In P3HT-rich blends, both glassy phases are present as nanosized domains, evenly distributed in the BHJ, as visualized via vapor phase infiltration (VPI) “staining”. In contrast, the 1:1 (by weight) and NFA-rich blends show clear, lateral phase separation between large (>500 nm) domains of the glassy phases and thinner polymer-rich domains that are unaffected by annealing. Our observations help to explain earlier P3HT: ITIC device studies; and also highlight the complexity of NFA-based BHJs, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the phase behavior of such systems.",

The organogel system consists of long-chain amidoamine (C18AA) and 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) monomers. The high helicity degree of the nanoribbons was measured by circular dichroism, and the helical direction can be regulated by right-/left-CP light. The helical direction of the right- and left- nanoribbons originated from the right- and left-CP light irradiation of the organogel. Our new concept using CP light in supramolecular organogels may lead to potential applications in biology, pharmacology, and chiral optics.",

However, the mechanism underlying the phenomenon is still unclear. Herein, we designed organic charge-transfer ferromagnets using different small molecule acceptors to investigate the key factors determining ferromagnetic performance. We found that the electron–phonon (e–p) coupling of the acceptors affects the interfacial interaction, which in turn changes the strength of ferromagnetism. Under an external magnetic field, the e–p coupling in the acceptors intensifies, yielding a weak interfacial spin–dipole interaction. The charge-transfer ferromagnets exhibited magnetic anisotropy due to the difference in the spatial structure symmetry of acceptors. Overall, this study deepens the understanding of interfacial interactions in organic charge-transfer ferromagnets, providing a new perspective for designing organic ferromagnets.",

In response, we have fabricated a noninvasive tool for the diagnosis and immunotherapy surveillance of breast cancer (BC). The diagnostic tool functions by performing dual-aptamer-activated tandem assembly of a nanocatalyst for visually tracking tumor-derived exosomal programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). By accurately identifying serum exosomal PD-L1 derived from BC, the diagnostic tool can rival immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the early classification of PD-L1-positive groups, PD-L1-negative groups, and healthy donors. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of the response to immunotherapy in 6 BC patients treated with anti-PD-L1 antibodies has been successfully achieved with the naked eye or a mobile phone camera by virtue of this diagnostic tool, which is highly consistent with computed tomography. Together, our work offers an unprecedented diagnostic tool for identifying potential beneficiaries and monitoring the response to immunotherapy, which highlights the significance of exosomal PD-L1 derived from tumors as a potential tumor prognostic and diagnostic factor including but not limited to BC.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is among the most important measured physical parameters. Despite that numerous polymeric temperature sensors having been reported, none of these systems can record the time that the object was heated to a certain temperature. Here, we report a supramolecular approach for developing a smart polymeric hydrogel capable of measuring the temperature and the duration of the heat exposure. This double memory principle is based on dual kinetic control of the dissociation of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetrachloride (CBPQT4+,4Cl–)-naphthalene host–guest complexes within a thermoresponsive naphthalene functionalized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel. Heating-induced collapse of this LCST polymer hydrogel induces host–guest complex dissociation, followed by the diffusion-controlled release of the free CBPQT4+,4Cl– host into the medium surrounding the hydrogel. This partial host release is governed by the heat exposure time and the heating temperature that controls the extent of dehydration of the hydrogel and, thus, the diffusion rate of the CBPQT4+,4Cl–. Hence, the amount of host released is an indicator for both the heating temperature and the heating time of the hydrogel and can be recorded by determining the reswelling capability of the hydrogel in water. As such, measuring the reswelling capability provides information on how long the hydrogel system was exposed to a certain temperature.",

    "abstract": "Metal iron plays exceedingly important roles in maintaining normal biological activities and is stored as an intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). Disturbing LIP balance to disorganize physiological reactions holds great promise in tumor therapy yet is still lacking exploration. Herein, a novel synergetic strategy was designed for tumor therapy with high efficacy and biocompatibility, which was realized through the metal-free poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-ebselen (EBS) nanocomposites. After degradation, EDTA chelates Fe2+ to deplete intracellular LIP, and EBS inactivates DMT1 protein to inhibit iron supplementation from extracellular regions. This LIP destruction causes the downregulation of iron–sulfur cluster levels, which compromises mitochondrial energy metabolism and arrests the cell cycle. Effective tumor elimination is achieved under PLGA-EDTA-EBS treatment with negligible side effects. This work presents an effective formulation for tumor therapy through a synergetic stock depletion and supply blockage strategy, thereby providing essential implications for the design of tumor therapeutic methods with minimal biosafety issues.",

As α-quartz crystallizes in a chiral space group, such twinning can occur between enantiomorphs with the same handedness or with opposite handedness. Here, we use first-principles methods to investigate the effect of twinning and chirality on the bulk and surface phonon spectra, as well as on the topological properties of phonons in α-quartz. We demonstrate that, even though the dispersion appears identical for all twins along all high-symmetry lines and at all high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, the dispersions can be distinct at generic momenta for some twin structures. Furthermore, when the twinning occurs between different enantiomorphs, the charges of all Weyl nodal points flip, which leads to mirror symmetric isofrequency contours of the surface arcs on certain surfaces. We show that this allows negative refraction to occur at interfaces between certain twins of α-quartz.",

    "abstract": "The built-in potential in the space charge layer dominates migration of charge carriers in a traditional photoelectrode model. In this work, through particle engineering and surface reconstruction, a Rh-doped rutile TiO2 (Rh-TiO2) photoelectrode is fabricated, in which the Rh concentration is decreased gradiently in TiO2 particle directed from conductive substrate to solution. Since the Rh dopants involve intragap states above the valence band of TiO2, it shapes a built-in potential that orients the migration of photoexcited holes toward substrate and repels the electrons to solution side, which change the Rh-TiO2 electrode from photoanode to photocathode. Comparison of intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) results using ultraviolet and visible light across a wide potential window unveils the different roles of dopants in charge dynamics. The operando chemical status of Rh is further verified by spectroelectrochemical characterization. The present strategy of directional doping not only is conducive to improving electron–hole separation but also provides a new approach to unleash the potential of a semiconductor as both photoanode and photocathode.",

    "abstract": "Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) wastes have attracted significant concern in terms of the environment, economy, and health. Although there is considerable emphasis on the recycling of PVC waste, research on its upgrading conversion still faces great challenges. Here, a ZnO-assisted dehalogenation strategy under facile solvothermal conditions is demonstrated for upgrading PVC to high-value carbon materials. Chlorine content is reduced from ∼56.7 wt % (pristine PVC) to ∼1.7 wt %, removing ∼96.9% Cl. Besides, the total carbon residue rate of such a method reaches up to ∼75 at. %. For comparison, it is only ∼26 atom % for the direct pyrolysis of PVC, along with the corrosive HCl and highly toxic dioxins. The as-prepared carbon materials with porous structure, high-content sp2-C, and lamellar layers allow a faster kinetic rate of the Faraday reaction and promotes the ions diffusion between layers. As the anode of the lithium-ion battery, the optimal sample delivers 500.5 mAh g–1 at 125 mA g–1 and maintains a stable capacity of 150.6 mAh g–1 even at 6250 mA g–1. This work provides a promising strategy for upcycling PVC into high-value products.",

To enhance conductivity for high-power applications, we developed affordable Li3PS4-LiCl (LPSCls) solid electrolytes with an ionic conductivity of ∼1.1 mS/cm (Li3PS4:LiCl = 2:1, 200 °C). Our study examines the long- and short-range structural order and ion dynamics of LPSCls, using neutron diffraction, magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 31P NMR reveals a unique disordered anion structure comprising a blend of Cl-modified β, γ, and amorphous PS43– units. Additionally, NMR relaxometry highlights enhanced Li+ mobility enabled by this diverse anion sublattice, allowing Li+ ions to migrate efficiently among different anions with similar affinity. Our findings unveil novel anion species within LPSCls, offering insights for optimizing ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes for ASSBs.",

Herein, we uncover the intrinsic ground-state and excited-state chirality in chiral 1D perovskite crystals, study excited-state chirality in mixed-halide films with suppressed signal crosstalk, and achieve and enhance chirality-triggered SPE in three dimensions (3D) embedded in one-dimensional (1D) (3D@1D) perovskites toward displays. SPE in 3D@1D perovskites was modulated by varying the 1D-to-3D molar ratios, leading to a record efficiency of 89.04% for chirality-induced optical spin polarization. It was further enhanced by stimulated emission, reducing operation temperature, and altering halide composition, resulting in a significantly boosted glum of 29.2%. These results provide an in-depth understanding of chirality-triggered SPE in high-performance optoelectronics.",

In this effort, inspired by the unprecedented efficiency of natural photosynthesis, we propose an intramolecular modular assembled (iMMA) strategy to improve photosensitization based on off-the-shelf chromophores. Specifically, we built a π-stacking dyad PS-An from PS chromophore with intrinsically wide absorption and triplet property aligned with An chromophore. PS-An showed an impressive extension in excited state lifetime from 20.6 μs (PS) to 0.79 ms and a full charge separation, which not only increased the sensibility to O2 but also boosted the dominant superoxide anion (O2•–) production in the Type I process. Moreover, it proved its success in boosting Type I PDT efficiency of cancer cell under hypoxic conditions and solid tumors in mice. This is the first example that π-stacking iMMA strategy is used to regulate the PSs to boost the Type I photosensitization.",

Herein, we report the growth of large-area coastline-like fractal bismuthene films with intrinsic statistical self-similarity through an interlayer-confined alloying dissolution–precipitation epitaxy method via the construction of a sandwich structure of h-BN/Cu/Mo foil with a nanoconfined space and a sequential dissolution–precipitation process. The resulting bismuthene film manifests a coastline-like fractal feature with a tunable fractal dimension and thickness regulated by the thickness of Cu film. The fractal bismuthene film can be seamlessly transferred to other substrates without incurring oxidation, impurity residues, or structural damage. A 50-nm-thick bismuthene film exhibits semimetallic properties, while an 8-nm-thick bismuthene film behaves as a p-type semiconductor, confirming a typical metal-to-semiconductor transition behavior. This study suggests the significant potential of interlayer-confined precipitation epitaxy strategy in producing large-area two-dimensional metallene films, thereby advancing the development of cutting-edge nanodevices.",

The CZPM nanoplatform was prepared by employing CuNCs as a source of light and Fenton metal, encapsulated with ZIF-8 for synergistic IIT, and finally modified with mannose. The obtained CZPM nanoplatform could enhance cellular uptake of CT26 and M2 TAMs and respond to cleavage in the acidic environment of endosomes and lysosomes, releasing Zn2+ and CuNCs for IIT synergistically enhancing CDT. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the CZPM showed significant therapeutic effects.

Furthermore, through a comparison of their electronic structures, we rationalize the origin of this difference and highlight the role of charge carrier concentration in dictating bulk electrical conductivity.

Therefore, we are convinced that biphen[3]arenes with larger cavity sizes not only demonstrate enhanced protein loading and binding capacity in vitro, but also manifest prolonged antigen retention time and heightened immune activation ability in vivo.

Recently, an increasing number of reports have suggested that RTP from purely organic phosphorescent materials requires the presence of trace impurities or dopants in the bulk emitter. Contributing to a better understanding of mechanistic aspects, we demonstrate that the RTP lifetime is directly proportional to intermolecular charge transfer (CT) properties of the crystalline bulk emitter. Given that the CT efficiency is contingent on crystal packing arrangement, variations of interemitter distances in the crystal lattice by modulating sterics of the emitter core structure represent an efficient means to manipulate the dopant-induced RTP lifetime. The versatility of the \"steric modulation\" approach has been demonstrated in two different dopant/emitter systems. A 38-fold increase (from 21 to 775 ms) was observed in the RTP lifetime of benzo[b]carbazole-doped carbazole-containing materials.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid sequential deposition (HSD) of perovskite thin films is highly desirable for constructing tandem solar cells on textured silicon substrates. However, in the second step of HSD, where the inorganic and organic bilayers undergo thermal interdiffusion to form perovskite, performance is often limited by the need for a very dry environment (inert gas atmosphere or dry air with relative humidity below 10%) and incomplete reactions throughout the film thickness. Here, we demonstrate a longitudinal homogenized intermediate (LHI) strategy that enables the preparation of HSD perovskites under ambient conditions (25 °C, 30%–50% relative humidity). This approach circumvents the formation of a perovskite capping layer, promoting uniform interdiffusion of the organic–inorganic bilayer. As a result, the efficiency of 1.68 eV perovskite solar cells processed in air using HSD improved from 16.42% to 20.65%, leading to an efficiency of 28.55% for textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells.",

    "abstract": "Herein, to tackle the current issue of ignoring cell interactions and spatial heterogeneity in in vitro glomerulus models, a core–shell composite gel microsphere with interzonal intercommunication was developed. By adjusting the diameter ratio of the Dex-Alg/PEG-Alg droplet to the GelMA droplet, the size, shape, and compartment ratio of the droplet can be controlled. This setup keeps compartments separate yet interconnected, closely resembling the spatial arrangement of cells in glomeruli and their physiological state. Noteworthily, glomerular endothelial cells, which are supported by mesangial cells, form blood vessels, whereas podocytes form an epithelial barrier. Key functional proteins were increased, and electron imaging revealed the creation of the basement membrane. Moreover, Doxorubicin-treated models demonstrated enhanced cell death, podocyte loss, and kidney damage, which were reduced by dexrazoxane. Thus, we believe that in vitro 3D glomerular models with zone structures have significant potential for glomerular research.",

Our study of differences between Al- and Ga-doped LLZO when interfaced with lithium metal using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory shows a higher propensity of Ga to move across LLZO interface with Li metal and form Ga–Li alloy. Neutron diffraction reveals loss of cubic phase resulting from the loss of dopant that explains electrochemical behavior differences between Ga- and Al-doped LLZO.

We found that the deposition rate of organic components in the initial sputtering stage is greater than that of inorganic components, leading to the ion ratio of perovskite thin films being accurately regulated by adjusting the sputtering time. Furthermore, the injected content of methylammonium bromide will significantly affect the ion ratios and crystal structures of the sputtered perovskite films.

However, the creation of a spatiotemporally controllable and cascade-activatable tumor-specific photoimmunotherapy platform for precise immunotherapy remains a challenge. Herein, cascade-activatable tumor-specific immunomodulators (CAI) are reported for cancer photoimmunotherapy. Under 808 nm irradiation, the CAI not only mediates phototherapy effect to achieve tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death but also triggers in situ release of caged toll-like receptor 7/8 R848-QPA. Additionally, the intracellular NQO1 activates R848-QPA, leading to the cleavage of trimethyl lock and release of active R848 agonist, enhancing the antitumor immune response. Such a cascade-activatable nanoimmunomodulator can effectively inhibit bilateral tumor growth and enhances systemic immune activation, resulting in improved infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T cell. Therefore, this modular-designed engineered paradigm provides a generic strategy for developing immunomodulators for precise cascade-activatable immunotherapy.",

Al2O3 layers grown directly on LPSCl particles significantly stabilize the surface chemistry and Li-ion transport properties relative to uncoated material upon exposure to both an ambient atmosphere (22% relative humidity, RH) and humidified O2 (100% RH). Detailed investigations indicate that coatings impede the surface and bulk degradation kinetics of exposed materials, even for coatings as thin as ∼1 Å. This suggests that stabilization is due to more than just a physical barrier. Shifts in valence band edge positions of coated LPSCl indicate that ALD coatings alter the surface electronic structure and resulting oxidation tendency of underlying LPSCl, suggesting new avenues to improving the environmental stability of sulfide SSEs.",

In this study, we demonstrate this approach for zeolite ZSM-22 (TON) with very small crystal sizes (<1 μm), where the high spatial resolution of elemental mapping in combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy allows one to obtain a high sensitivity for the detection of early-stage crystals. The crystallization of TON proceeds through a primary alkali rich amorphous phase that evolves to a secondary poorly crystalline phase which already possesses the composition of the final zeolite crystals.

A luminescent defect is discovered in TAPC during degradation in blue OLEDs, which is induced by a two-step electron-induced process. To suppress this degradation, we propose a negative-charge management strategy by introducing a strong electron-withdrawing material, fullerene, at the TAPC interface. This strategy is proven effective in blue phosphorescent OLEDs, resulting in not only a 10-fold enhancement in operational lifetime but also a significant suppression in efficiency roll-off at high brightness over 30 000 cd m–2.

Herein, we try to understand how the electronic structure, d-band center, and atomic orbital bonding influence the gas adsorption energy, which exhibits a strong correlation with both the selectivity and sensitivity of gas-sensing materials. As a result, the lattice distortion induced by introducing heteroatoms prompts La atoms to actively participate in the gas adsorption process, which leads to the formation of multiatomic orbital hybridization bonds, significantly increasing the adsorption energy of ethanol and acetone molecules. This work illustrates that creating greater lattice distortion is an effective strategy to modulate the strength of gas adsorption, which is important for guiding the design and synthesis of metal-oxide semiconductor gas-sensing materials.",

Combined with surface microstructuring, these characteristics provide our SMV dry adhesive with excellent adhesion strength (∼1.75 MPa) and reversibility (∼1000) due to the shape memory effect. Such an outstanding adhesive capability is further highlighted by reprocessing the SMV dry adhesive, thus reforming its permanent shape to adapt to an arbitrary adherend shape.

The switching of topography is achieved by the expansion and contraction of the polymer caused by the melting and crystallization of the soft segment that results in the buckling of lamellae. In the molten stage, lamellae can be buckled in a certain direction by capillary forces caused by water droplets between two lamellae. In addition, the interlamellar distance between neighbors' lamellae can be managed by water droplets. Finally, we have demonstrated the possibility of creating electrically conductive surfaces with switchable conductivity achieved by the reversible buckling of the lamellae.",

    "abstract": "Point defects are often naturally present in materials or incorporated intentionally to achieve new functionality and can dominate the optoelectronic properties of materials. To better control their impact, it is necessary to understand how the presence of a specific defect results in new electronic excitations. To this end, first-principles calculations have provided important insight into the energetics associated with point defects in materials, such as trap state energies, absorption energies, charge transition levels, and formation energies. In this review article, we provide an overview of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) studies aimed at predicting excited-state energies in defective materials with quantitative accuracy. While first-principles density functional theory (DFT) has been applied extensively to these material systems, MBPT provides a greater degree of accuracy in electron–electron interactions that may be required in some cases at the cost of greater computational complexity. We show that MBPT predicts quantitatively accurate energies when compared with experiment in limited cases for which it has been tested. Additionally, we discuss benchmarks against DFT and limitations due to common approximations, including the dependence on the DFT starting point and exclusion of electron–phonon interactions. Lastly, we discuss new insight provided by MBPT for materials with deep localized defect states and strong excitonic effects.",

However, filamentary RRAM cells are affected by transitions from abrupt switching to analog switching. In this study, we develop Al2O3 nanodome-shaped arrays (NDSAs) by glancing-angle deposition technology (GLAD) to geometrically confine the conducting filaments (CFs), for which conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) was performed to analyze positions and dimensions of filaments. For the Pt/HfO2/75% Al2O3 NDSAs/TiN device, the dimension of the CFs can be restricted to 10–12 nm, whereas for the Pt/HfO2/TiN device, the CFs were formed with a dimension of ∼50 nm. The device first yielded multiple weak CFs that subsequently transformed to stronger and larger CFs when the coverage of Al2O3 NDSAs was reduced to 55% while Pt/HfO2/75% Al2O3 NDSAs/TiN device exhibited synaptic features with more linear potentiation and depression, demonstrating the analog switching. The controllable coverages of Al2O3 NDSAs render the geometric design more promising as a memristor for future applications in neuromorphic computing.",

Tuning the MC sign is crucial to realize practical application based on these spin effects. Herein, we report the manipulation of MC signs in organic photodiode based on the ground-state and excited-state charge–transfer (CT) interfaces at room temperature. Different to the traditional CT interfaces that normally show positive MC, the ground-state CT (GSCT) interface presents negative MC due to the dominant spin-mixing channel from weakly bound polaron-pairs states, in which a main reverse intersystem crossing from the triplet to singlet states will lead to the opposite signs of magnetic field dependence. By adjusting the ground-state or excited-state CT process in one tandem device under electric and optical excitations, the device could reveal a low-field controlled current inverter. Our work shows the important role of organic CT states in the manipulation of the spin-related magneto-optoelectronic properties in organic semiconductors.",

Here, we report on a water-assisted route for the cost-effective, scalable transformation of bulk aluminum–lithium alloys into ceramic alumina NWs and aerogels. In this study, we employ water as the intermediary solvent for dealloying to form monolithic porous Li-doped aluminum metal, which can then be converted to ultralong metal–organic NWs, then to hydroxide NWs after hydrolysis and finally to NW aerogels after freeze-drying. As a high-performance thermal interface material for electronic devices, the oxidized alumina NW aerogels infiltrated with epoxy show significantly improved thermal properties.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advancements in implantable microdevices, providing sufficient electrical power to deeply seated microsystems has remained challenging due to the small dimension of the system, limiting the total storable energy. Ultrasound powering, where a portion of the externally induced ultrasonic wave is converted to electrical power by a small receiver, has been explored as an attractive source of power, especially for deeply seated implantable microdevices. While all other components have been advanced and miniaturized, the ultrasonic receiver is still a slab of bulk piezoelectric materials, e.g., diced PZT (lead zirconate titanate). Such a rectangular or disc shape is not an ideal form factor for wireless ultrasonic power transfer due to many challenges, particularly angular sensitivity with respect to an incoming ultrasonic wave. In this paper, we present the first demonstration of omnidirectional ultrasonic powering enabled by the high geometrical symmetry of three-dimensional polyhedral shapes. Based on our 3D printing technique of lead-free piezoelectric barium titanate ceramic, we designed highly symmetric, miniaturized, regular polyhedra, known as Platonic solids (i.e., cube, octahedron, dodecahedron), as well as a sphere. For each geometry, we investigate the effect of axial and radial piezoelectric poling, output power levels, efficiency, and angular sensitivity while the surface areas are the same. Across all the geometric shapes, radially poled Platonic solid receivers produce at least 1 order of magnitude larger electrical power density compared to diced PZT. Further, we observed that the higher the order of Platonic solid, the more excellent power transfer efficiency and omnidirectionality. The 3D printability of the Platonic solid also allows for customizable packaging, which we implemented as an implantable light source. Overall, the proposed ultrasonic powering scheme warrants a revolutionary solution for implantable biomedical devices.",

One particularly promising application of these materials is in X-ray detectors. This requires a high degree of tolerance to the effects of ionizing radiation, and one of the main drawbacks of lead halide perovskites is their instability, with respect to a wide variety of environmental stimuli. Although we know a lot about how moisture, oxygen, and visible light affect and degrade the perovskite lattice, relatively little is known about the radiation tolerance of these materials. In this work, we discuss the effect of high-energy (15.12 keV) X-ray radiation on perovskites of various compositions. We use in situ GIWAXS (grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering) to follow the structural changes that occur as the result of X-ray exposure in atmospheres of varying relative humidity. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that there is a low compositional and humidity dependence on the rate of radiation damage in perovskite films. An accumulating radiation dose is associated with increasing structural disorder including the formation of ion vacancies and Schottky defects. These results are an important first step in the design of robust, radiation-tolerant, and perovskite-based X-ray detectors.",

The interlayer spacing was controlled by the concentration and length of diamine spacers, varying from 7.8 to 10.5 Å. Quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) were employed to conduct a cross-investigation into the sensitivity and selectivity of GOF. The enlarged diffusion channel width of the optimized GOF allows for easy accessibility of DMMP, resulting in over 99% selectivity compared to interfering volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and an 8.7-fold increase in adsorption sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Metal–organic or all-inorganic Sb(V) bromide complexes are a novel class of semiconductor materials with potential use in optoelectronic devices. The implementation of these materials for optoelectronics is currently prohibited by their poor thermal stability and crippling solvent compatibility issues. Here, we address these limitations by introducing a new method for the synthesis of Sb(V) bromide complexes and thin films. The \"post-deposition bromination\" method presented here enables the fabrication of presumably any Sb(V) complex not previously accessible as thin films. We screen a set of Sb(V) bromides, identifying two promising candidate materials incorporating tetraethylammonium (TEA) or 2-chloro-N-methylpyridinium (CNMP). To prove the validity of the methods introduced in this work, we fabricate high-quality thin films of these complexes for the first time. Thin films of these materials are stable up to 110 °C (based on TGA measurements), which is significantly higher than the previously reported state-of-the-art complex from N-ethylpyridinium (NEP, approx. 50 °C). Additionally, cation dependent band gap tunability is observed with thin films of the novel complexes having a direct band gap at 2.20 (CNMP) and 2.55 eV (TEA) as determined by optical analysis. The methodology introduced in this study provides an unprecedented platform for research into metal-organic Sb(V) thin film materials.",

Herein, we report a strategy for realizing new, stable, and robust barium phosphonate MOFs, termed Empa-1 and Empa-2. The two-dimensional (2D) Empa-1 or three-dimensional (3D) Empa-2 could be realized by way of systematically modulating the ratio of Ba2+ with a tetratopic phosphonate-based linker that was crafted to incorporate nitrogen-rich triazine units bridged by a fixed piperazine core. In addition to this synthetic approach, temperature-dependent synchrotron-radiation powder X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the 2D Empa-1 undergoes an irreversible phase transition upon heating and subsequent dehydration to form the 3D Empa-2. Given the presence of uncoordinated phosphonic acid moieties within the structure of 3D Empa-2, the CO2 sorption capabilities are reported. We believe our ability to link the alkaline earth metal barium with a novel tetratopic phosphonate linker, as evidenced by the robust structures of Empa-1 and -2, paves the way for further exploration and discovery of new crystalline, porous frameworks with greater structural diversity, stability, and wide-scale practical applicability.",

    "abstract": "There are a variety of methods available for forming thin films of electronic polymers, but very few of them are applicable to surfaces bearing relief structures on the micron scale. Of the methods that are capable of conformal coverage of such topography, most are applicable only to coatings that can be polymerized in situ—for example, by chemical vapor deposition—and are, thus, not amenable to polymers with complex molecular structures, such as π-conjugated (semiconducting) polymers. This Letter describes a method termed solid-phase deposition (SPD). The SPD process is a variant of water transfer printing whereby a thin film of a semiconducting polymer is suspended on water and taken up by a substrate bearing micron-scale relief structures (in this case, sharp pyramids etched in silicon). Under ambient conditions, solid films that are sufficiently compliant (thin, ductile, or of low modulus) can coat these surfaces readily. Stiffer films comprising higher modulus polymers can be made amenable to the process by the application of heat or solvent vapor. We successfully formed coatings from films of poly(3-alkylthiophenes) spanning the range from glassy (alkyl = butyl) to rubbery (alkyl = heptyl), along with the low-bandgap polymers DPP-DTT and PTB7-Th, on textured silicon and indium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years of the heyday of hybrid halide perovskites, so many metal cations additives have been tested to improve their optoelectronic properties that it is already difficult to find an element that has not yet been tried. Generally, the variety of these approaches is united under the name \"doping\"; however, there is currently no clear understanding of the mechanisms of the influence of the metal ion additives on the properties of the lead halide perovskite materials. For many ions, there is even no consensus on the most fundamental questions: what lattice position does a given ion occupy and is it incorporated in the structure at all? Here, we derived a system of effective radii of different metal ions in the iodine environment for the set of iodide compounds and reveal their crystal chemical role in the APbI3 perovskites. We analyzed the possible lattice positions for 40 most common monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metals to reveal whether they could successfully enter into the perovskite structures. We show that, at most, three parameters—effective size, electronegativity, and the softness of metal ions are the main ones for crystal chemical analysis of the possibility of metal doping of hybrid halide perovskites. Our results provide useful theoretical guidance to rationalize and improve current doping strategies of hybrid halide perovskites with metal ions.",

We present here a new aluminophosphate material, AlPO-91, which has five distinct cage types present in its framework. AlPO-91 was discovered through modifications to the synthesis of a related and previously reported material, AlPO-78. AlPO-91 and AlPO-78 represent an interesting subclass of ABC-6 materials in which a number of d6r and s6r subunits are equal. This property has important implications for the porosity and potential applications of AlPO-91 and related materials.",

Inspired by the natural wood petrification process, we report fabrication of porous oxide hollow fiber membranes via petrification of polymer hollow fiber templates at a much lower temperature (600 °C). These novel petrified hollow fiber membranes reproduce the asymmetric macropore structure of their polymer hollow fiber templates, thereby allowing rejection of macromolecular solutes without a secondary coating layer. They have a unique hierarchical micro-/meso-/macroporous structure with simultaneous high surface area and large pore volume. The findings of this work pave the way for wider applications of porous oxide membranes. More broadly, they allow simple and inexpensive control of the geometry of hierarchically porous oxides.",

The activation locations are determined by patterning molecules to be released in their inactive form within hydrogels at resolutions of tens of microns, whereas the time of activation is controlled by a DNA strand displacement reaction cascade that releases the target DNA oligonucleotides at precisely specified time intervals. This programmed activation of DNA from hydrogel substrates thus enables the scalable development of DNA-based reaction-diffusion systems that regulate DNA strand availability in space and time. This system could be used as a platform to autonomously activate predefined chemical signals embedded within a soft material.",

    "abstract": "All-solid-state batteries are receiving keen interest as emerging alternatives to conventional liquid electrolyte batteries owing to potential benefits that include the possibility of higher energy densities, enablement of anode-less designs, a wider range of temperature operation, and improvement in battery safety. The discovery and development of new solid-state electrolytes is a critical factor. One sought-after material is Li4PS4I that has long been predicted to exhibit high ionic conductivity, while experiment has disappointingly proven the contrary. Here, we address this long-standing issue and show that inducing Li sublattice disorder is key. We demonstrate the remarkable effects of aliovalent substitution in Li4+xP1–xSixS4I (x = 0.12 and 0.30) using a combination of single-crystal X-ray and powder neutron diffraction; Raman and impedance spectroscopy; ab initio molecular dynamics simulations; and the bond valence site energy approach. With increasing Si4+ and thus Li+ content in Li4+xP1–xSixS4I, configurational disorder of the Li sublattice is induced, leading to isotropic 3D-fast Li ion conductivity of 1.46 mS·cm–1 at room temperature for the Li4.3P0.7Si0.3S4 composition and a low activation energy of 0.32 eV. The unit cell volume is half that of the parent phase, Li4PS4I, which exhibits a fully ordered Li substructure that explains the latter's poor conductivity and high activation energy (0.046 mS·cm–1 and 0.44 eV, respectively). The deliberate creation of Li sublattice disorder (via Li ion \"stuffing\") is a pivotal strategy toward the development of new, fast ion conductors.",

Nonetheless, one of the most onerous obstacles that restricts the wide availability of CRISPR technology from wide practical applications is the lack of appropriate delivery vehicles for the simultaneous transportation of multicomponent CRISPR systems to the intracellular targets. Herein, we attempted to create an intriguing nanometer-scaled vesicle platform (CRISPRsome) that, with the aid of a block copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol)-polylysine, simultaneously combined the fundamental components of the CRISPR system into the CRISPRsome, particularly the ribonucleic sgRNA and proteinic Cas9 endonuclease precisely located at the intermediate membrane and the internal reservoir regions of the nanometer-scaled vesicles, respectively. Furthermore, biofunctionalization strategies, including using redox-responsive disulfide linkages between lysine units to cross-link the well-defined CRISPRsome structures and surface functionalization with the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp ligand to stimulate receptor-mediated endocytosis, were proposed in the well-defined CRISPRsome. The subsequent results validated its appreciable gene knockout efficacies toward cancerous cells with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, thereby highlighting the prosperous potential of CRISPRsome to facilitate the use of CRISPR technology in a variety of practical applications.",

Both efficient charge transport and suitable microstructure are required to achieve high responsiveness. Herein, we report a heteroepitaxy strategy to fabricate highly aligned organic crystalline thin films with both high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent charge mobility. A solution-sheared one-dimensional crystalline film is first grown as a template, and the vacuum deposited active layer undergoes template-guided vertical heteroepitaxial growth, leading to the formation of the highly aligned morphology. A mobility as high as 2.9 cm2 V–1 s–1 with good air stability is achieved because of the highly oriented morphology and the passivation effect on surface traps by the template layer. Importantly, such structured films with high mobility exhibit excellent performance in UV light and gas detection. The strategy reported in the current study holds great promises in constructing highly responsive surfaces/interfaces.",

This material, in its bulk form, was found to have a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 86%, which is a record value for halide double perovskites.

Notably, even for an optimized surface ligand coating, achieved by combining dodecanoic acid and decylamine, a maximum PLQY value of only 37% is reached, with no further improvements observed when exploiting post-synthesis ligand exchange procedures (involving Cs-oleate, different ammonium halides, thiocyanates, and sulfonic acids). Our density functional theory calculations indicate that, even with the best ligand combinations, a small fraction of unpassivated surface sites, namely undercoordinated Cl ions, is sufficient to create deep trap states, opposite to the case of Pb-based perovskites that exhibit much higher defect tolerance. This was corroborated by our transient absorption measurements, which evidenced that an ultrafast trapping of holes (most likely mediated by surface Cl-trap states) competes with their localization at the AgCl6 octahedra, from where, instead, they can undergo an optically active recombination, yielding the observed PL emission. Our results highlight that alternative surface passivation strategies should be devised in order to further optimize the PLQY of double-perovskite NCs, which might include their incorporation inside inorganic shells.",

    "abstract": "Xenon binding has received considerable interest, but effective hosts remain rare, and the majority of assembly-type hosts are barely explored. Here, we report the synthesis, self-assembly, and xenon inclusion behavior with a homemade mesomeric bisurea–bisthiourea macrocycle. Compared to its racemic counterparts as recently investigated, the single mesomeric macrocycle forms even more comprehensive dimerization assemblies. From the single macrocycle component, up to two pairs of enantiomeric homochiral dimeric assemblies are formed. In the presence of xenon, the assembly diversity was pushed further, and an additional pair of enantiomeric heterochiral assemblies is induced. The diverse assembly comes from the macrocycle component adopting a folded, dissymmetric chiral conformation and undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking upon cross-buckling together. The formed capsular assemblies possess a sealed, adaptive cavity for accommodating xenon. The cumulative xenon binding constant with the induced heterochiral capsule is about two times higher than the prior one assembled from racemic counterparts. The xenon-induced heterochiral capsule formation with the mesomeric macrocycle again demonstrates that xenon can find its own preferred host from a dynamic self-assembly system and likes to be accommodated by a more spherical van der Waals surrounding.",

    "abstract": "Aptamer-functionalized membranes are a promising platform for toxin removal and small-molecule sequestration. However, this function can be compromised when the aptamer binding sites become saturated, and regeneration of the membrane requires heat and multiple washes to restore the aptamer binding capabilities. Additionally, bound molecules can be eluted into water sources, resulting in recontamination. Herein, we address this challenge by creating autonomously self-regenerating membranes through the tandem use of aptamers and enzymes to trap and degrade small-molecule contaminants. To demonstrate this approach, we developed an enzyme–aptamer-functionalized membrane that sequesters and degrades the small-molecule contaminant bisphenol A (BPA) from water. We show that BPA is not only depleted but also degraded, as the membrane is able to be reused for multiple cycles without the need for heat or washing to restore function. Given the large number of reported DNA aptamers for small molecule analytes, we envision that this research will provide a broadly applicable platform for the removal of waterborne contaminants.",

However, progress in this field is hindered by the high electrical conductivity and weak piezoelectricity of 2D ferroelectrics: establishing not only a magnitude but also a sign of the piezoelectric coefficient in these materials via measurements of the electrically induced strain as a function of polarization proved to be extremely challenging. Here, we report investigation of the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient in the recently discovered 2D ferroelectric 1T′′-MoS2 by means of local probe microscopy techniques. The electromechanical response and the surface potential of the flexoelectrically poled 1T′′-MoS2 have been tested by piezoresponse and Kelvin probe force microscopies, respectively. The comparative interferometric displacement spectroscopy studies provide solid evidence of the mechanically induced polarization direction in 1T′′-MoS2 and allow quantification of its piezoelectric response. It is found that 1T′′-MoS2 exhibits negative piezoelectricity with a d33 value of the order of −3 pm/V. First-principles density-functional theory calculations support the experimental findings for d33 in both sign and magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an incurable autoinflammatory disorder associated with metabolic abnormalities. Excessive polyamine production in keratinocytes plays a vital role in the initiation and progression of psoriasis. In this study, we propose a new strategy to degrade polyamines and ameliorate psoriasis development based on the new type of polyoxometalate (POMs)-based silver material C32H100Ag6O98P2S16W24 (HT-1). HT-1 possessed efficient peroxidase (POD) and oxidase (OXD)-like activities for promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under visible light (VIS) irradiation. The generated ROS from HT-1 efficiently decreased the levels of polyamines and reduced IL-17A-induced psoriatic responses in keratinocytes. Meanwhile, photocatalytic depletion of polyamines by HT-1 also reduced the endosomal self-RNA sensing in DCs, impairing the maturation and T cells priming function of DC, thereby attenuating the development of psoriasis. In summary, this study may pave the way for a promising treatment approach for psoriasis, even for other autoinflammatory diseases.",

Here, a photodriven self-augmented precision controllable nanoplatform was constructed by designing a novel pump-type switch cross-linker with 1O2-activation to covalently cross-link the topoisomerase I of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) concurrently loading chlorin e6 (Ce6) to obtain the anticipative nanopump-CNs. After laser irradiation, the nanopump can be controllably unlocked, realizing the self-enhanced cascade amplification process of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) while releasing the chemotherapy drug. Significantly, SN38 can effectively increase the sensitivity of tumor-related organelles to ROS while inducing DNA damage in tumor cells, thus, amplifying the efficacy of photodynamics caused by Ce6. This cascade self-enhanced drug nanosystem based on exogenous controlled chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy is expected to provide a new perspective for designing nanomedicine with a precise regulation model for malignant tumor therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tin triphosphide (SnP3), featured with a 2D layered structure similar to rhombohedral black phosphorus (BP), has garnered significant attention for its potential application in high-performance energy storage devices due to the high electrical conductivity and fast ionic mobility superior to BP. Searching for a feasible strategy to produce high-quality SnP3 materials is a vital prerequisite for industrial device applications; however, thus far it remains a technical challenge. In this work, we report the successful synthesis of large-size crystalline SnP3 (8 mm in diameter and maximal grain size up to 42.6 μm) with a uniform elemental distribution by a high-pressure and high-temperature method, which exhibits good metallic behavior with electrical conductivity of 1.23 × 106 S m–1 at 300 K, above 3000 times higher than that of BP. High-quality 2D SnP3 nanosheets (NSs) with a mean thickness of 6.2 nm and a largest lateral size of 9.5 μm are achieved by a liquid-phase exfoliation method. Our results show that the fabricated SnP3 NSs composited by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit high electrochemical performance as flexible supercapacitor electrode materials with excellent cycle stability (88% retained capacitance after 20,000 cycles) and outstanding mechanical flexibility (72% capacitance remaining at a bending angle of 180°). The assembled supercapacitor with SnP3/CNT electrodes shows good temperature tolerance over a wide range from −50 to 60 °C, which displays 82.3% capacitance retention after 6,000 cooling–heating cycles. This study reveals that the produced SnP3 NSs enable the development of reliable electrodes for flexible energy storage devices under extremely harsh conditions, including strong folding and low-temperature environments.",

The phenotypes of cell proliferation, morphology, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression were investigated. Compared with ordinary methods, the scaffold-based OS models obtained the obvious advantage of inducing fatty acid biosynthesis, synthase expression, and classic signaling pathway. The metabolomic analysis revealed that the most abundant metabolites appeared in the type of lipids, and the metabolic differences mainly came from biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. The comparison with clinical trials indicated the scaffold-based model as a potential alternative platform to discover OS pathogenesis mechanisms and to develop novel diagnosis methods that would be otherwise missed in ordinary ways.",

Herein, the inorganic additive ammonium halide was introduced into the precursor solution to form the NH4Pb2Br5 intermediate phase and regulate the nucleation and crystallization of the film through the interaction of ammonium and chlorine groups with CsPbBr3 crystals. As a result of stress relaxation and simultaneous defect passivation of the perovskite films, the top-performing PSC displays an impressive efficiency of 10.61%, with an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage of 1.650 V.

    "abstract": "Solid-state lithium batteries are a promising solution to the next generation of electrochemical energy storage systems due to their large energy storage density and high levels of safety. Particularly, Li1+xAlxTi2–x(PO4)3 (LATP) has been recently attracting significant interest as it exhibits high Li-ion mobility and ionic conductivity. In addition to the doping level, the electrical properties of LATP can be altered by mechanical deformations. In this work, the strain effect on the Li-ion conductivity in Li1.33Al0.33Ti1.67(PO4)3 (LATP-0.33) was investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is shown by MD that the ionic conductivity of LATP can be significantly enhanced by the application of appropriate mechanical strains. Further DFT calculations have been performed to study the mechanism for the strain-enhanced conductivity of Li ions in LATP. It is illustrated that the applied strain can lead to the reduced interactions of Li ions with the neighboring O atoms in TiO6 along the Li-ion migration pathway and thus enhances the mobility of Li ions in LATP. The strain-induced enhancement of Li-ion migration in LATP as revealed in this work can be helpful for designing and engineering solid-state lithium batteries.",

This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the ambipolar and anisotropic carrier transport properties and mechanisms in single crystals of the nonfullerene acceptor COi8DFIC. To achieve this, a lateral time-of-flight (TOF) technique was employed. COi8DFIC films with long-range ordered molecular packing were prepared, and the growth direction of the crystals was confirmed to be perpendicular to the crystal (11̅1̅) face. The in-plane carrier transport properties were then characterized in orientations parallel and perpendicular to the growth direction, revealing ambipolar transport in both orientations. By examining the correlation between drift mobility and temperature or electric field, we observed a Gaussian disorder model for hole transport, showcasing varying levels of energetic and positional disorder along the two orientations. Furthermore, we observed a variable range hopping model for electron transport with different hopping distances along the two orientations.",

Notably, metastable cubic Li5FeO4 has achieved a reversible capacity of 346 mAh g–1, utilizing cationic iron and anionic oxygen redox reactions. However, the cyclability of solid-state oxygen redox in this system is hindered by concurrent, irreversible, and simultaneous evolution of the O2 gas evolution. In this study, we enhance the cyclability through the incorporation of earth-abundant p-block elements into cubic Li5FeO4. We find that the covalent bonding between the oxygen species and the p-block element elevates the oxidation potential of the O2 gas release without altering the solid-state oxygen redox potential.",

However, the development of MIECs with desirable conduction and stability remains a great challenge. Herein, we present the first example of an open-framework metal chalcogenide for use as a MIEC with mixed sodium ion and electron conduction. The open-framework metal chalcogenide, Na4Cu8Ge3S12·xH2O (NCGS), comprised of a {[Cu8Ge3S12]4–}∞ anion framework, Na+ counter cations, and lattice water molecules, displays good thermal stability and remarkable resistance to acid and alkali. Importantly, NCGS exhibits fast mixed sodium ion and electron conduction under high humidity conditions, with a sodium ionic conductivity of 4.05 × 10–2 S cm–1 and electronic conductivity of 4.03 × 10–3 S cm–1 at room temperature and achieves the maximum value of 1.16 × 10–1 S cm–1 and 8.12 × 10–2 S cm–1 at 328 K, respectively.

Our results illustrate the stabilizing effect of SrSnO3 on the antiferroelectric phase via the enhancement of mesostructural order. In doing so, our method establishes a new platform for exploring the impact of disorder on the long-range strain heterogeneity within antiferroelectrics and other materials with modulated crystal structures.",

Compared to the static method, the colloid-milling method not only greatly improves the production efficiency by 2 orders of magnitude but also produces smaller nano-MOFs with narrower size distribution that exhibit higher catalytic activity than the larger-sized ones.

In this study, a series of hexabenzocoronene oligomers are synthesized, and their charge transport behaviors are investigated by using both dynamic and static single-molecule junction techniques. Remarkably, hexabenzocoronene oligomer-based dynamic single-molecule junctions with gold electrodes show an exceptionally low conductance attenuation coefficient of ∼0.046 Å–1, while static single-molecule junctions based on graphene electrodes exhibit a triple value of conductance attenuation. Via the introduction of ionic liquid gates, the molecular conductance is regulated effectively, reducing the attenuation coefficient by more than 50%, due to precise control of the energy offset between the Fermi level of the electrodes and the molecular energy levels. These findings, particularly the efficient control of the molecular conductance attenuation at ultralow levels, indicate a novel approach to achieving long-range transport for practical molecular electronics.",

Here, we report a novel pH/GSH cascade activated core–shell nanocatalyst (MDC) to enhance cancer targeting and catalytic efficiency for synergistic CDT. The CaCO3 shell protects the internal MnSiO3 from degradation by GSH during blood transport. In an acidic tumor microenvironment, the rapid biodegradation of CaCO3 induces CO2 production, pH increase, and Ca2+ overload. Subsequently, the exposed MnSiO3 core serves as a drug delivery platform with a GSH responsive Mn2+ and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) release function. The generated CO2 optimizes the catalytic conditions, with DHA acting as a substrate for catalysis, both of which promote Mn2+-mediated ROS generation. In synergy with Ca2+ overload, they collectively accelerate a storm of ROS, activating the Caspase-1/gasdermin D mediated pyroptosis and achieved remarkable tumor inhibition. Such a multicascade responsive nanoplatform is highly instructive for further metal nanocatalysts mediated cancer therapies.",

Here we realize controlled polymorphic microcrystals of a dicyanodistyrylbenzene derivative (A) via a seed-induced pathway transformation. Small-sized α-A nanocrystals that are thermodynamically stable are prepared via a microspacing physical vapor transport (PVT) method. These vapor-grown nanocrystals function as seeds and tailor the assembled pathway of potentially occurring β-A microcrystals corresponding to kinetically metastable products, leading to the controlled growth of α-A microcrystals. Intriguingly, the length and surface area of the seed-induced α-A microcrystals increase linearly with the molar ratios of the added monomer to seeds. Such a seed-induced transformation strategy resembles living supramolecular polymerization of amphiphilic dyes, which is also applicable to more polymorphic π-conjugated microcrystals even binary alloys.

    "abstract": "Narrow-bandgap (NBG) perovskite solar cells based on tin–lead mixed perovskite absorbers suffer from significant open-circuit voltage (VOC) losses due primarily to a high defect density and charge carrier recombination at the device interfaces. In this study, the VOC losses in NBG perovskite single junction cells (Eg = 1.21 eV) are addressed. The optimized NBG subcell is then used to fabricate highly efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). The improvement in the VOC is achieved via the addition of a thin poly(triarylamine) interlayer between the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-based hole transport layer (HTL) and the NBG perovskite. The optimal bilayer HTL results in a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, compared to 17.8% of the PEDOT:PSS-based control device. The VOC improvement of the single-junction NBG cell is also successfully transferred to all-perovskite TSC, resulting in a high VOC of 2.00 V and a PCE of 25.1%.",

    "abstract": "Due to the enhanced carrier–carrier interaction, carrier multiplication (CM) in graphitic materials is efficient and exhibits strong wavelength dependence. However, there is still a lack of direct evidence for excitation photon energy-dependent impact ionization, the origin of CM. In this work, time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to measure the electron dynamics in graphite. We find the unusual preceding growth of electron signal in 0–0.35 eV compared with that in 0.35–0.70 eV and 0.70–1.05 eV during the absorption of UV (3.10 eV) pulses, unambiguously suggesting the occurrence of impact ionization. Such phenomena are much less significant under IR (1.55 eV) excitation. Taking into account the electron–phonon scatterings during the electron thermalization, the CM value is calculated to be 2.0 and 1.4 under UV and IR excitation, respectively. This work provides direct evidence for excitation photon energy-dependent impact ionization, which will benefit the potential applications of graphitic materials.",

The rising prevalence of age-related diseases has brought tremendous pressure on social medical systems and the economy. Against this backdrop, research on anticellular aging has become a hot spot in the field of biomedicine, and biomaterials are showing new trends and potential in this area. Compared to drugs and other traditional anti-aging strategies, biomaterials can be personalized to target the aging characteristics of different tissues, serving as drug delivery carriers to enhance targeting, and can directly influence the cellular aging process by modulating the cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, biomaterials offer innovative approaches to diagnosing age-related diseases and building sophisticated models, which enhance our understanding of the biology behind cellular aging and speed up the advancement of novel anti-aging treatments. This review synthesizes the latest advancements in biomaterial research for combating cellular aging, exploring future prospects and potential challenges.",

    "abstract": "Proton transport via a dynamic chemistry method is an essential pathway in both biology and chemistry. In chemical catalysis, proton-shuttling catalysts were developed by mimicking the proton-transport processes in biological systems. However, YH (Y = O, N, S, etc.) units are typically essential for enabling proton transport in these catalysts. Herein, we present a novel strategy for constructing in situ reversible proton-shuttling covalent organic framework catalysts, avoiding the need for Y–H functional groups. Specifically, we demonstrate that the 2D bis(imino)pyridine Cu-bipy-COF material could transform to a water proton-shuttling catalyst by using the reversible interconversion between imine and hemiamine. This catalyst could effectively catalyze the hydration of benzonitrile in neat water without the use of a toxic organic solvent.",

    "abstract": "Dual-energy X-ray imaging technology provides more detailed material-specific information by using a second X-ray spectrum. However, conventional dual-energy X-ray imaging typically necessitates two separate exposures to combine high- and low-energy projections. This process can result in image misalignment and increased radiation doses. Herein, a dual-energy X-ray imaging system using a two-layered scintillator was developed, featuring transparent pure organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials as the low-energy absorption layer and LYSO as the high-energy absorption layer. Separating the energy bins on the detector side enables the simultaneous and sequential acquisition of low- and high-energy projections with a single X-ray exposure. This two-layered scintillator achieves a high imaging resolution of 23 lp/mm, surpassing most conventional single-layer scintillators. Additionally, the effectiveness of this dual-energy imaging system was demonstrated in a toolbox inspection, where complex objects inside were successfully imaged and differentiated, capturing all intricate details in a single X-ray exposure.",

    "abstract": "The double ionization of molecular dopants enables the doping efficiency (free charges per dopant molecule) to rise above 100%. However, the current models of doped organic semiconductors based on Fermi–Dirac statistics fail to explain the double ionization of dopants and also the analogous situation of bipolaron formation on a host polymer. Here, we address this shortcoming by considering the renormalization of the state energies upon electron transfer between host and p-dopant. We vary the model parameters─the reorganization energy and evolutions of ionization energies and electron affinities upon charging─and plot the fractions of doubly ionized, singly ionized, and neutral species. The model shows good agreement with experimental measurements of doubly ionized p-dopants and bipolarons on a p-doped polymer. With these insights, we suggest that the state energy renormalization upon charging is the key parameter to be minimized for double ionization of dopants or maximized to avoid formation of bipolarons on the host.",

    "abstract": "A strategy based on N-type organic wide-bandgap materials to form heterojunctions enhances carrier separation and achieves high-performance UV detection. This approach addresses issues such as low UV detection performance and insufficient depth of detection wavelengths. In our study, we combined two N-type semiconductor materials with a p-type small molecule to form a heterojunction serving as the photosensitive layer. This configuration successfully achieved a high-performance solar-blind ultraviolet (SBUV) detector, exhibiting a maximum responsivity (R) of 227 A/W, an EQE of 1.1 × 105%, and a peak detectivity of 3.3 × 1011 Jones under 260 nm illumination with an intensity of 50 μW/cm2. Furthermore, by employing Al2O3 with a high dielectric constant as the gate dielectric, we developed a detector operable with a low drive voltage of 1.8 V. This provides a valuable research paradigm for future organic ultraviolet detection endeavors.",

    "abstract": "Microneedle patches have gained significant attention for transdermal drug delivery, particularly those made from hydrophilic polymers for hydrophilic drugs. However, delivering poorly water-soluble lipophilic drugs remains a challenge. Our study introduces a lipid-based microneedle patch capable of effectively delivering lipophilic drugs with mechanically robust needles that penetrate physiological barriers like skin. Using a high-yield melt casting method, we produced needles up to 1200 μm in length with tunable melting points and phase transitions by adjusting lipid compositions. These patches release drugs at body temperature (37 °C). In a proof-of-concept experiment, curcumin, a model lipophilic drug, was fully dissolved and uniformly distributed in the needles, with drug loadings up to 50 wt %. Ex vivo studies demonstrated successful needle penetration and drug release in porcine skin. This lipid-based microneedle platform offers an effective solution for the transdermal, transmucosal, and buccal delivery of lipophilic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is expected to become a new type of adjuvant therapy for cancer owing to its advantages, such as noninvasive, high spatiotemporal selectivity, and fewer side effects. However, conventional organic photosensitizers can easily aggregate in a biological system, leading to decreased fluorescence quenching and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, attributed to the inherent hypoxia and immunosuppressive properties of the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), the efficacy of PDT is severely restricted. Given this, groundbreaking work has constructed carrier-free self-assembled nanoplatforms (TNTP-Ra NPs) based on the newly synthesized zwitterionic PS-TNTP that has satisfactory image-guided PDT and offers a new vision for delivery of rapamycin with poor water solubility. Simultaneously, the coassembled rapamycin regulates the vigorous aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells and inhibits the expression of PD-L1 by targeting the mTOR axis to remold hypoxia and immunosuppression TME. Accordingly, the multifunctional nanoplatform integrating AIEgen-mediated PDT and TME remodeling is a forward-looking PDT design strategy.",

    "abstract": "Chemical amplification has been widely applied in applications ranging from stimuli sensing to advanced photoresists, but it is rarely utilized to drive productive mechanical property changes. Here, we demonstrate the use of a base amplifier to drive the gelation of a functional polymer solution, in response to a subthreshold base trigger through a mechanism whereby the trigger drives a dramatic increase in the base concentration driven by base amplification, resulting in complexation of Fe(III) and polymer-bound catechol groups and subsequent gelation of the polymer solution. The concomitant crystallization of dibenzofulvene, which is a byproduct of base amplification, led to significant stiffening of the resultant gel and an unexpected temperature-sensitive change of gel stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Electronic mobility and conductivity of S1–xSex are computed from first-principles throughout the compositional spectrum. This system spans both the band transport domain and the hopping domain due to the inherently semicrystalline, pseudomolecular atomic structure in the form of the packed eight-atom rings. By and large, mobility decreases initially with Se alloying, before eventually increasing toward the Se-end. Even dilute addition of Se into S triggers strong polaronic localization of electrons and a rapid transition from band transport to hopping. Up to x = 0.50, electron transport exhibits a mixture of quantum motion (\"tunneling\") and temperature-activated hopping behavior, whereby the former dominates at 200 K and below while the latter dominates at higher temperatures. Electron transport turns completely temperature activated around x = 0.50, before returning to the mixed behavior by x = 0.75, and recovering band transport at pure Se. Intrinsic electron conductivity monotonically increases with x due to the increased intrinsic carrier concentration as the band gap decreases, though the benefit is at most by an order of magnitude up to x = 0.25. Our work provides insights into intricate charge transport properties of the S–Se system while demonstrating a holistic first-principles blueprint for treating mixed-domain charge transport in complex crystals spanning band transport and hopping.",
