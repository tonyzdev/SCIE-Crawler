    "abstract": "In this study, we explore various regions of the brains of Alzheimer' s Disease (AD) patients before and after acupuncture treatment of acupoints in the brain in order to determine the effect, if any, of acupuncture on AD. Twenty-six patients with clinically-diagnosed AD underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing acupuncture at the four acupoints of Shenmen (HT 7), Zusanli (ST 36), Fenglong (ST 40) and Taixi (KI 3). fMRI Block design paradigm was chosen by electroacupumcture interval stimulation, and the data of fMRI were analyzed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 99). The result demonstrated that there were right main hemisphere activations (temporal lobe, such as hippocampal gyrus, insula, and some area of parietal lobe) and left activated regions (temporal lobe, parietal lobule, some regions of cerebellum). The activated regions induced by these acupoints were consistent with impaired areas in brain for AD patients, which were closely correlated with the cognitive function (memory, reason, language, executive, etc.). The present study provided the strong evidence that acupuncture had a potential effect on AD, and in partial revealed the mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The present paper was to review the physiological bases of acupuncture analgesia (AA) on normal subjects, patients, and animals. Effect of acupuncture on pain perception in normal subjects was studied and compared with sham acupuncture. It was shown that the analgesic effect of acupuncture has its physiological basis. Using neurophysiological, neuropharmacological, neurobiochemical and neuromorphological methods, the neurohumoral mechanism of AA was studied from the peripheral neural pathway of acupuncture sensation (De-Qi sensation in Chinese traditional medicine) to the central neuromodulatory effect of AA. It was indicated that needling of acupuncture point could activate the afferent fibers of peripheral nerves to elicit De-Qi sensation, then ascended mainly through the ventro-lateral funiculi, which conducted pain and temperature sensation upward to the brain, activated the antinociceptive system including certain brain nuclei. modulators (opioid peptides), neurotransmitters, through the descending inhibitory pathway resulting in analgesia. Especially the clinical and laboratory results indicated that the endogenous opiate peptides (EOP) participated in AA from the presynaptic level to the receptor sites, which provided a scientific basis for understanding the mechanism of AA. Substantial evidences have been accumulated that acupuncture has prominent analgesic effect; but it fails to give sufficient analgesia during operation. Some effective measures to improve the therapeutic effect of acupuncture, such as the combination of acupuncture with drugs, the selection of suitable EA parameters and optimal time spacing should be adopted.",

Mathematical simulations and estimates from the literature suggest that the depth of penetration of laser radiation using wavelengths from 630nm up to 1100nm may be up to 50mm. The aim of this study is to directly measure the penetration depth of a Low Level Laser in human tissue. Human abdominal skin samples up to 0.784mm thickness were harvested by dermatome following abdominoplasty procedures. These samples were irradiated by a Gallium Aluminium Arsenide Laser (Wavelength 850nm near infra-red invisible light, 100mW, 24kHz, 0.28mm diameter probe) and the transmitted radiation measured with an Ophir Optronics 'Nova' external energy meter. The intensity of laser radiation reduced by 66% after being transmitted through a 0.784mm sample of human abdominal tissue. In this study most laser radiation was absorbed within the first 1mm of skin.",

    "abstract": "Through its traditional rules, the practice of acupuncture requires knowledge of the channel networks and point locations. For nearly three centuries, morphological research did not show any evidence on peripheral morphological support of the channels. Their courses appear as referred sensations, and the persistence of propogated sensations along the channels in amputees and their cessation after total section of the spinal cord implicates a neuraxial participation. The spatial sequence of the segmental centers seems to be the indispensable primary structure. Through the various centers having a topical organization, the somesthetic areas appear as the necessary structural support of the propogated sensation along the channel. Acupuncture points are less discussed as a basis of acupuncture in the West, but they do have equivalences in all medical systems. Nervous structures are necessary for acupuncture to work, and complete denervation totally suppresses the effect of the points. There is not only one type of acupuncture point but many of them, and the concomitant stimulation of multiple and clearly defined structures is necessary to obtain the acupuncture sensation, De Qi. Thus, the effect seems strictly correlated with convergence of nerve impulses on the primary centers. Lastly, accurate anatomical knowledge of the point and its correct puncture (location, direction, depth) are indispensable to get satisfactory therapeutical effects and to avoid iatrogenic incidents.",

    "abstract": "Cancer pain impairs the quality of life of cancer patients, but opioid analgesics can not only cause inhibition of respiratory function, and constipation, but also other significant side effects such as addiction and tolerance that further decrease quality of life. Thus, in the present study, the effects of electro-acupuncture treatment (EA) on mechanical allodynia were examined in cancer pain mouse model. In order to induce neuropathic cancer pain model, S-180 sarcoma cells were inoculated around the sciatic nerve of left legs of Balb/c mice. The mass of S-180 cancer cells embedded around sciatic nerve in a time course was confirmed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning. Mechanical allodynia was most consistently induced in mouse sarcoma cell line S-180 (2 x 10(6) sarcoma cells) treated group among all groups. EA stimulation (2Hz) was daily given to ST36 (Zusanli) of S-180 bearing mice for 30 min for 9 days after S-180 inoculation. EA treatment significantly prolonged paw withdrawal latency from 5 days after inoculation as well as shortened cumulative lifting duration from 7 days after inoculation compared with tumor control. In addition, the overexpressions of pain peptide substance P in dorsal horn of spinal cord were significantly decreased in EA treated group compared with tumor control on Day 9 after inoculation. Furthermore, EA treatment effectively increased the concentration of beta endorphin in blood and brain of mice more than tumor control as well as normal group. The concentration of beta-endorphin for EA treatment group increased by 51.457% in blood 12.6% in brain respectively, compared with tumor control group. These findings suggest that S-180 cancer pain model can be a consistent and short time animal model and also EA treatment can be an alternative therapeutic method for cancer pain via decreased substance P and increased beta endorphin.",

In 6 of these cycles which showed ovulation, the hand skin temperature (HST) of these patients was increased after EA treatment. In the other 7 cycles ovulation was not induced. There were no regular changes in HST of 5 normal subjects. The level of radioimmunoreactive beta-endorphin (r beta-E) fluctuated, and returned to the preacupunctural level in 30 min. after withdrawal of needles in normal subjects. After EA, the level of blood r beta-E in cycles with ovulation declined or maintained the range of normal subjects. But the level of blood r beta-E in cycles in which the induction failed to cause ovulation was kept higher that that of normal. (P less than 0.05). There was a negative correlation in the decrease of blood r beta-E and increase of HST after EA (r = 0.677, P less than 0.01). EA is able to regulate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Since a good response is usually accompanied with the increase of HST, monitoring HST may provide a rough but simple method for predicting the curative effect of EA. The role of r beta-E in the mechanism of EA ovulation induction was discussed.",

A randomized clinical trial carried out on 44 patients belonging to two groups of 22 each, suffering from shoulder myofascial pain: group A: superficial acupuncture; group B: deep acupuncture. All of them subjected to the same model of treatment with 13 needles and the treatment of the most painful 4 trigger points (TP) found in the shoulder's area. In the group A patients, the needles were introduced in the skin at a depth of 2 mm, on the TP. In the group B patients, the needles were placed deeply both in the muscular acupuncture points and in the TP. The treatment was planned for a cycle of 8 sessions, the first 4 to be performed twice a week, the last 4 weekly. The intensity of pain was evaluated with the McGill Pain Questionnaire before beginning the therapy, at the end of the therapy, and at the follow-up after 1 and 3 months. Both techniques had efficacy in controlling pain. A statistically significant difference rose between the two needling techniques at the end of the treatment and at the follow up after one and three months. Deep acupuncture shows to be better at all times and this underlines the importance of the muscular afferences in acupunctural stimulation in the control of pain.",

However, we detected 10(-3) gauss (mGauss) order bio-magnetic field strength from the palm in special persons who emitted External Qi (\"Chi\" or \"Ki\"). This detection was possible by special arranged magnetic field detection system, consisted of a pair of 2 identical coils with 80,000 turns and a high sensitivity amplifier. Each of the coils were rolled 80,000 turns accurately, and were connected in series in opposite direction, actuating as a gradiometer. We measure bio-magnetic field strength in 37 subjects with this detection system. The only 3 subjects of them exhibited strong bio-magnetic field of 2 to 4 mGauss in frequency range of 4 to 10 Hz. This magnetic field strength was greater than that of normal human bio-magnetism by 1,000 times at least. A simultaneous measurement of bio-magnetic field strength and its corresponding bio-electric current was examined in one subject. During exhibiting such strong bio-magnetism, its corresponding electric current was not detectable. Therefore, the extra-ordinary large bio-magnetic field strength can not derive from internal body current alone, hence the origin of the large bio-magnetism is still unknown. We suppose that the extraordinary large bio-magnetic field strength might be originated from \"Qi\" energy in the oriental medicine or in the oriental traditional philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture and non-acupuncture points were differentiated by their connection to different pathways in the central nervous system. We have found that the pathway connected to the acupuncture point is different from the pathway connected to the non-acupuncture point. In addition, pathway connected to the non-acupuncture point is inhibited within the lateral periaqueductal gray when the analgesia inhibitory system (AIS) is activated. We have explored these pathways by means of selective lesioning of discrete brain regions, selective stimulation of brain regions, as well as by recording evoked potentials arising from stimulation of acupuncture and non-acupuncture points. It was found that the lateral centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and the posterior hypothalamus are parts of the AIS. The acupuncture (tibialis muscle) and non-acupuncture (abdominal muscle) points are both connected to the AIS. Analgesia caused by stimulation of the acupuncture point is naloxone reversible, while that caused by stimulation of the non-acupuncture point after lesion of AIS is dexamethasone reversible. Stress-induced analgesia caused by low frequency electrical shock is naloxone as well as dexamethasone reversible. All three kinds of analgesia were abolished by hypophysectomy. The features and the degree of analgesia caused by intraperitoneal 0.5 mg/kg morphine were similar to analgesia caused by acupuncture point stimulation. D-phenylalanine acts like a lesion of AIS in analgesia caused by stimulation of acupuncture and non-acupuncture points, and enhances naloxone reversible analgesia. The descending pain inhibitory system plays a role as the common pathway to produce these three kinds of analgesia. This pathway is found in the arcuate nucleus (dopaminergic), ventromedian nucleus of the hypothalamus, raphe nucleus (serotonergic), reticular gigantocellular nucleus (noradrenergic) and reticular paragigantocellular nucleus.",

The results showed that the acute ischemic stroke patients treated by drug or EA+ drug were all partially recovered, but the clinical functional recovery in EA+ drug group was significantly better than in the drug group (P < 0.01). In laboratory, the model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used in rats. The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) was recorded before and after MCAO. EA was applied one hour after cerebral ischemia and once a day after reperfusion for 7 days in EA+ MCAO group. It was shown that the amplitude of P1-N1 wave of SEP before MCAO was 100%. After MCAO 30 min the P1-N1 wave of SEP on the ipsilateral side of MCAO was decreased to 2.2 +/- 3% (MCAO group), 1.9 +/- 2% (MCAO+ EA group); and then recovered to 25.5 +/- 14.1% (MCAO group), 58.6 +/- 27.2% (MCAO+ EA group) after 7 days of reperfusion following MCAO 2 hours.

The selected acupoints GB34 (Yanglinquan) and GB39 (Xuanzhong) were at the same gallbladder meridian based on traditional Chinese medicine. In our study we devise three distinct EA (electroacupuncture) manipulations: real EA (deep needling at acupoints), sham EA (deep needling at no-meridian points) and shallow EA (subcutaneous needling at acupoints). Twelve healthy volunteers with right-handiness were enrolled and received three different EA manipulations in counter-balanced orders. DeQi scores were used to evaluate the degree of needling sensation. We found real EA can induce significant stronger needling sensation than sham EA and shallow EA. Multisubjects group mean analysis showed that pain-related cortex including primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (SI and S II), anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), insula were involved in three EA stimulation. Bilateral activation of prefrontal gyrus and occipital cortex were exclusively found in real EA. Deactivation over the rostral segment of ACC was also shown in real and shallow EA. Further paired two difference analysis indicated that real EA induced higher activation than sham EA over bilateral prefrontal gyrus, right-side occipital gyrus and deactivation over the rostral segment of ACC. In the comparing with real EA versus shallow EA, there was right-side activation over the SI, S II, motor cortex, ACC, insula, thalamus, hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum; also activation over bilateral prefrontal gyrus, caudate and pons. Although no significant activation was found over periaqueductal gray (PAG), further analysis showed the mean and maximal signal changes were different under three EA manipulations. We concluded that EA at analgesic acupoints of same meridian maybe involved the pain-related neuromatrix especially the hypothalamus-limbic system; deep EA at meridian points could elicit stronger needling sensation and modulate the pain-related neuromatrix more effectively than EA at nonmeridian points or shallow EA at meridian points.",

This study aimed to review the descriptions of the characteristics of acupuncture-like TENS reported within the published literature up to June 2011. A total of 88 items of published literature were retrieved.. 35 authors or groups provided 1 publication (Single Contributions - SC) and 10 authors or groups provided more than 1 publication (Multiple Contributions - MC). In order to gain the acupuncture-like effects of TENS, authors often characterised acupuncture-like TENS using: an intensity that caused muscle contractions (6MC, 17SC), or a sensation to tolerance threshold (3MC, 4SC); a 1-4 pulses per second (pps) pulse rate (5MC, 16SC); a 100-200 micros pulse duration (2MC, 8SC); stimulation to acupuncture points (5MC, 4SC), or myotomes (3MC, 3SC), or over the painful area (3MC, 1SC). Critically, unlike many authors included in the present review, the International Association for the Study of Pain core curriculum does not mention the triggering of muscle contractions when acupuncture-like TENS is defined. This may be an area that that they should reconsider.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese therapeutic method, has been widely used in clinical practice to treat diseases such as stroke, Bell's palsy, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson diseases, dysmenorrhea and chronic pain. Mounting lab data had suggested that electro-acupuncture could alleviate dementia and restore long term potentiation of hippocampus in rat. Clinical data also indicated that electro-acupuncture could improve electrical activity of brain in vascular dementia patients. However, its biological basis and acute effects on hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) remain not well understood. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether acute electro-acupuncture (acupoints: ST36 and SP6; continuous wave, 2 mV, 2Hz; lasted 20 min) could enhance LTP of perforant path-dentate gyrus granule cells in anesthetized rat and explore its underlying mechanisms. We found that electro-acupuncture could significantly increase PS2/PS1 in pair pulse test ( p &lt;0.05, inter-pulse interval: 20ms and 90ms). When compared to control group, electro-acupuncture could significantly enhance LTP to about 234% which was about 143% of that in control group ( p &lt;0.05). It suggested that electro-acupuncture could modulate the function of interneurons in hippocampus hence increase LTP.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure control is an important component of cardiovascular disease prevention. Despite the advances in the treatment of hypertension, effective management remains poor. The combined use of multiple drug strategies fail to regulate blood pressure and chronic use of those agents cause severe side-effects. New strategies are required to control high blood pressure. We aim in our study to research the effects of acupuncture treatment on blood pressure of hypertensive patients who have already been exposed to antihypertensive drug therapy for at least 24 months. Each patient was using 1-3 antihypertensive drug of a heterogeneous pharmacological group ranging from ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and beta blockers and the most common complaint of those patients were fatigue, dizziness, weakness, headache and joint pain, sleeping problems, cold hands and feet, edema, depression. We did not alter patients' diet (salt intake), physical activity or use of antihypertensive drugs. The study includes 24 male and 10 female patients. Ki 3 (Taixi), Liv 3 (Taichong), Sp 9 (Yinlingquan), L.I. 4 (Hegu), Ht 7 (Shenmen), St 36 (Zusanli), Sp 6 (Sanyinjiao), Ki 7 (Fulio), Lu 9 acupuncture points were needled. After being treated with acupuncture for one month in every two days for a total of 15 sessions, we found significant reductions (p 001) in both systolic (from 163.14 ± 19.33 to 129.49 ± 18.52) and diastolic (from 94.37 ± 19.70 to 79.31 ± 7.87) blood pressures of these patients. The aim here is not to compare the effectiveness of acupuncture and drug therapy on blood pressure, but to simply report that on patients currently using antihypertensive medication, acupuncture facilitated a significant reduction in blood pressure and reduced the patients complaints. We therefore conclude that our data strongly suggest that acupuncture should be in the hypertension treatment guidelines and widely used for blood pressure regulation.",

    "abstract": "Pain relief mechanisms of needling to the pain-producing muscle, application of a static magnetic field or external qigong, and needling to the acupuncture point were investigated in an experimentally designed pain producing muscle of animals. Single isometric twitch height in situ was reduced gradually by 10 Hz tetanic stimulation for one hour of the gastrocnemius muscle of guinea pigs. This reduction of twitch height was recovered by injection of 0.3-1 ml saline to the artery of this muscle, or of injection of a vasodilator, isoproterenol dissolved in 0.1 ml saline. Hence, reduction of twitch height could be induced by reduction of circulation in the muscle and recovery of it could be induced be recovery of circulation. Since it is easily considered that a pain substance might be accumulated in a muscle under reduced circulation, and such an accumulated substance might be eliminated by recovery of circulation, the reduction of twitch height after tetanic stimulation could be estimated as the pain-producing muscle and recovery of twitch, as the pain relieving muscle. 1) Needling to the pain muscle, 2) application of a static magnetic field or external qigong to the muscle, and 3) needling to the acupuncture point recovered the reduced twitch height due to tetanic stimulation. Atropine abolished this effect induced by the above 1, 2 and 3 procedures. Hence, the cholinergic vasodilator nerve might be involved in the induction of this effect. A sciatic nerve cut did not influence the effect of 1), but abolished the effect of 3). Denervation and capsaicin abolished the effect of 1). Substance P and a calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP) recovered the reduced twitch height, and atropine blocked the effect of CGRP, but did not block that of substance P. The effect of 2) was equivalent to that of anticholinesterase. A rostral lesion of the contralateral anterior hypothalamus did not abolish the effect of 3, but a caudal lesion of this region did. Electrical stimulation of this region produced an effect similar to that of 3). From these results, it was concluded that muscle pain relief by these procedures might be induced by recovery of circulation due to the enhanced release of acetylcholine as a result of activation of the cholinergic vasodilator nerve endings innervated to the muscle artery. However, manners of activation of the cholinergic nerve was different in effects of 1), 2) and 3). 1) might be induced by axon reflex of the CGRP nerve, 2) might be induced by inhibition of cholinesterase and 3) might be induced by a somato-autonomic reflex. The reflex center of this might be in the anterior hypothalamus.",

Electroacupuncture at the dogs' \"Tsu San-Li\" (St. 36) points showed a significant decrease in blood pressure, while the heart rate was not affected. The depressor effect was naloxone (0.2 mg/kg iv) reversible, and accompanied by an increased blood flow at the mesenteric artery, so it is suggested that the depressor effect was due to inhibition of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. This inhibition was mediated by endogenous opioid peptides released by acupuncture. The location of this mediation was further analyzed. The central mechanism was evidenced by the ineffectiveness of acupuncture in reducing blood pressure in anesthetized dogs. On the other hand, the demonstration of opiate receptors in the blood vessels by radio-receptor assay provided evidence of peripheral mediation of blood pressure by opioids. The blood vessel might be a target organ for the plasma opioids, which can also be increased by acupuncture.",

T10 spinal cord segments of 50 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were completely transected, and then NSCs were immediately transplanted into the transected site of the experimental animals, while control animals were sham operated without transplantation. Five days post-operation, electro-acupuncture treatment on GV9 (Zhiyang), GV6 (Jizhong), GV2 (Yaoshu) and GV1 (Changqiang) acupoints was applied for 14 days (EA+NSCs 14d) and 30 days (EA+NSCs 30d). ELISA and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess the content of neurotrophine-3 (NT-3) and the characteristics of transplanted NSCs. We found that the number of transplanted NSCs the survived in EA+NSCs14d group was significantly increased as compared to that of the NSCs30d group (5825.20 +/- 819.01 vs 4781.40 +/- 500.49, P<0.05). Immunostaining indicated that some transplanted NSCs developed into microtubule association protein 2 (MAP2) positive cells and many of them developed into glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells in the NSCs30d group. Further, the migration length of transplanted NSCs toward caudal tissue in the injured site was longer in the EA+NSCs30d group than that in NSCs30d group (5.98 +/- 0.79 mm vs 3.96 +/- 1.72 mm; P<0.05). Also NT-3 in injured spinal cord tissue was 23% increased in the EA+NSCs14d group.

Acupuncture not only quickly relieve the symptoms of acute angina pectoris, but also improve nitroglycerine's therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is an efficient simple therapeutic method used for emergency and for regular angina treatment. Review of studies on acupuncture therapy has shown effectiveness were between 80% to 96.2% that are almost as effective as conventional drug regimen. When compared with conventional medical treatment, the acupuncture therapy shows the obvious advantage of lacking, adverse side effects commonly associated with the Western anti-anginal drugs such as 1) Nitroglycerine (headache-63% with nitroglycerine patch and 50% with spray; syncope-4%; and dizziness-8% with patch; hypotension-4% with patch; and increased angina 2% with patch). 2) Isosorbide mononitrate (dizziness-3 to 5%; nausea/vomiting-2 to 4% and other reactions including hypotension, and syncope even with small doses). 3) Propranolol (bradycardia, chest pain, hypotension, worsening of AV conduction disturbance, Raynaud's syndrome, mental depression, hyperglycemia, etc.). Many conventional anti-anginal medications cause inter-drug reactions with other medications the patients taking for other diseases. Whereas, acupuncture therapy does not pose such an interference with patient's medications. Nevertheless, surgery is still the treatment of choice when acupuncture or conventional drug therapy fails. Combination of conventional drug therapy and acupuncture would considerably decrease the frequency and the required dosage of drug taking, thereby decreasing the unpleasant side effects of the drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to investigate whether the electro-acupuncture (EA) is beneficial to extenuate cerebral ischemic injuries following the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in monkey. The results indicated that after MCAO. the EEG was severely inhibited, while the EEG recovery was slow after reperfusion compared with the control group. EA, given between the acupuncture points Baihui Point (GV. 20) and Renzhong Point (GV. 26) with a dense-sparse waveforms,which can be transformed into each other when dense or sparse wave is terminated, facilitated the recovery of EEG after ischema. The local cerebral blood flow (ICBF) in the striatum decreased during MCAO, whereas EA improved the ICBF significantly. The neurological deficit scale significantly decreased after ischemia but increased in EA group. The brain swelling coefficient (right/left) increased significantly in the ischemia group, but EA attenuated this increase. The neuropathological study showed that EA could significantly decrease the infarct area (p<0.05) and increase the percentages of the residual cells in the ipsilateral striatum and cortex (p<0.05 respectively). These results implied that EA is effective to extenuate cerebral ischemic injuries following the transient middle artery occlusion in monkeys.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on ischemia-induced neurogenesis in the striatum of adult rat brains with a 30-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion. Injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 30 mg/kg, i.p., cell proliferation marker) and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-6,6'-di(4-sulfophenyl)-3,3',3',3' -tetramethylindocarbo-cyanine (DiI, 1 microg/ microl, i.c.v, lipophilic neuronal tracer) combined with multiple fluorescence immunostaining were used to determine whether the proliferated cells were newly generated neurons and where they originated from in the brain. We demonstrated that EA treatment (60 Hz 1 s and 2 Hz 3 s alternately at an intensity of 10 mA for 20 min on \"Fengfu\", GV.16 and \"Jinsuo\", GV.8) enhanced stroke-induced striatal neurogenesis in rat brains as follows: 1) EA increased the number of BrdU+ cells, indicating that it activates cell proliferation; 2) EA increased BrdU+/CRMP-4(+) (collapsing response mediated protein-4, immature neuron marker) and BrdU+/MAP-2(+) (microtubule-associated protein 2, mature neuron marker) cells, suggesting that it facilitates neurogenesis and maturation of newly generated neurons; 3) EA expanded the distribution of DiI-stained cells in the striatum. Moreover, most BrdU+/CRMP-4(+) or BrdU+/MAP-2(+) cells in the striatum were observed DiI+ staining. Thus, the results suggest that striatal newborn neurons mainly migrate from the cells lining ventricle. Therefore, we conclude that EA can improve neuronal regeneration, newborn neuron migration and their maturation in the striatum of adult rat brains after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Having seen pregnant women pressing the P6 point as a preventative for morning sickness, stimulation of this point for 5-10 minutes by invasive (manual or electrical acupuncture) or non-invasive (transcutaneous electrical stimulation or acupressure) means was studied as an antiemetic. In well controlled studies it was shown that acupuncture administered before the opioid premedication significantly reduced postoperative sickness for 6-8 hours. Non-invasive methods were effective for a shorter period of time, with nausea and/or vomiting often occurring after 2 hours. To be effective the treatment has to be given before the opioid. Its effect can be abolished by local anesthesia. Stimulation of a dummy point near the elbow is ineffective. While acupressure reduces morning sickness, the pressure has to be applied for 5 minutes every 2 hours. There is probably a large psychological element in this. The most rewarding results are obtained when P6 stimulation is used in conjunction with standard antiemetics before cancer chemotherapy. Here again the invasive approach is more effective than non-invasive. Recent studies have involved self-stimulation using a portable battery-operated square wave stimulator fixed at 10 Hz, and a large EKG surface electrode on the P6 point. Stimulation is applied for 5 minutes every two hours. While modern antiemetics can control vomiting, they are relatively ineffective against nausea, but this can be controlled by regular use of the stimulator. The results are most promising.",

The pacemaker cells were classified as \"Astable Oscillators\" and nonpacemaker excitable cells as \"Monostable Oscillators,\" and application of a rapidly changing electromagnetic field to the cells was analyzed as a means of stimulating the cells. The understanding of the 10 essential electrical parameters is highly desirable for safe and effective electrical stimulation. Among these, emphasis was placed on the often neglected, important electrical parameters of \"output impedance\" of stimulation pulse wave complexes for + and - polarity components, as well as the importance of capacitive current (Ic = C.dV/dt) which depends on rise time as well as fall time of the stimulation pulse wave, and undesirable side effects of electrolysis phenomena due to excessive D.C. current. The difference and similarity between TENS (Transcutaneous Nerve Stimulation) and TES (Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation), TENMS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve and Muscle Stimulation) or TMS (Transcutaneous Muscle Stimulation) was discussed. The author's clinical study indicated that effective TES (TENMS)--characterized by effective muscle contraction without creating pain with a pulse repetition rate approximately the same as the heart rate of the individual--can often give superior beneficial effects in improvement of micro-circulation and subsequent relief of pain and other symptoms compared with TENS that creates stimulation of large diameter sensory nerve fibers without creating significant muscle contraction. Such improvement is often accompanied by the abolishment of the pain with disappearance of local substance P and increase in local serotonin with disappearance of local L-tryptophan.",

    "abstract": "The antipruritic effect of acupuncture was studied using a rat model of hindlimb scratching. After acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA), which was conducted for 30 min, itch-associated behavior was induced by an intradermal injection of 2% serotonin (20 microl) into the rostral back, and then numbers of scratching bouts were counted for 60 min. During the first experiment, acupuncture stimulations were applied to several different points. However acupuncture significantly reduced numbers of scratchings only when applied to cervical dermatomes. In the second experiment, plain acupuncture, or 2Hz, or 120Hz EA were applied to acupoints LI 11 and LI 4, at which acupuncture stimulation produced the greatest antipruritic effect in the 1st experiment, and as serotonin was administered in the same manner described for the 1st experiment. Results showed that 2Hz EA stimulation tended to increase pruritic bouts by approximately 18% versus the animals treated with plain acupuncture, whereas 120Hz EA stimulation tended to decrease pruritic bouts by approximately 39% compared with animals subjected to plain acupuncture. When nor-binaltorphimine (a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist) was pretreated to elucidate the relation between kappa-opioid receptor and the antipruritic effect of 120Hz EA, it was found to markedly inhibit the antipruritic effect of 120Hz EA. These results suggest that acupuncture and EA stimulation are effective treatments for pruritus if administered to dermatomes corresponding to affected sites or to adjacent dermatomes and that this effect is due to the antipruritic effect of kappa-opioid receptor activation maximally induced by high-frequency EA stimulation.",

    "abstract": "From a clinical perspective, the alternative forms of acupoint stimulation including electroacupuncture, moxibustion and acupressure appear to have more potent analgesic effects than manual needle acupuncture. Bee venom (BV) injection has also been reported to produce persistent nociceptive stimulation and to cause neuronal activation in the spinal cord. In previous study, we observed that BV stimulation into acupoint, namely BV acupuncture or Apipuncture, produced more potent anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive potency in rodent arthritis model as comparing with that of non-acupoint injection. Based on previous report, we decided to further investigate that BV injection into an acupoint produces antinociception as a result of its potent chemical stimulatory effect in both abdominal stretch assay and formalin test. Different doses of BV were injected into an acupoint or a non-acupoint 30 min prior to intraplantar formalin injection or intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. Using the abdominal stretch assay, we found that the high dose of BV (1:100 diluted in 20microl saline) produced a potent antinociceptive effect irrespective of the site of BV injection. In contrast the antinociceptive effect observed in both the writhing and formalin tests following administration of a low dose of BV (1:1000 diluted in 20microl saline) was significantly different between acupoint and non-acupoint sites. BV injection into an acupoint (Zhongwan, Cv. 12) was found to produce significantly greater antinociception than non-acupoint injection (10 mm from Zhongwan, Cv. 12) in the abdominal stretch assay. Similarly, in the formalin test, acupoint (Zusanli, St. 36) injection of BV produced more potent antinociception than non-acupoint injection (gluteal muscle). In contrast, BV injection into an arbitrary non-acupoint site on the back did not produce antinociception in either the writhing or formalin test. These results indicate that BV injection directly into an acupoint can produce a potent antinociceptive effect and suggest that this alternative form of acupoint stimulation (Apipuncture) may be a promising method for the relief of pain.",

We observed the threadlike structures on the surface of internal organs of animals. This threadlike structure may be the physical basis of the meridian-like network of internal organs as detected by the Bi-Digital O-Ring test imaging method. One of the characteristics of the threadlike structures is the presence of DNA containing granules or Bonghan granules that flow through the ducts. The aim of this study was to separate and characterize their morphology and ultrastructural features. Using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that Bonghan granules were round and measure 1.7-2.5 microm in diameter. They had a small nucleus surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm and a trilaminar plasma membrane. TEM also showed that they had cytoplasmic protrusions like pseudopodia. They contained fragmented DNA with a significant amount of 3'-OH ends. We compared their properties with the cell structure and general morphology of apoptotic bodies, bacteria, and the microcells. The motion of these granules was influenced by light, which may be related to the photo-therapy on the acupuncture points.",

Due to limitations of space, we mention only herbs showing anti-inflammatory activity in vivo when administered intra-orally, and having low toxicity. We will also introduce some popular Chinese medical prescriptions used in the treatment of arthritis, hepatitis and nephritis and attempt to explain their anti-inflammatory action resulting from the synergistic action of the herbs contained in these prescriptions. All references cited in this review were either written originally in English or have an English abstract.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of electroacupuncture and sham acupuncture in the treatment of patients with chronic neck pain. 31 patients with chronic neck pain were included in a randomised, controlled trial. Electric stimulation was given for 30 minutes at low frequency (1-4Hz), pulse width of 200 micros, interrupted wave form. Of the 29 patients who completed the therapy, 13 were assigned to conventional acupuncture and 16 to sham acupuncture groups, receiving 3 sessions a week for a total of 10 sessions, each lasting for 30 minutes. Patients were evaluated before and after therapy and 3 months later by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the bodily pain subscale of the Short Form Health Survey-36 scale. The treating physician was different from the evaluating physician who, like the patient, was blinded. VAS scores in both groups significantly reduced after therapy and at 3 months post-therapy, but the difference between groups was not significant. In respect of bodily pain, there was a significant improvement in the acupuncture group after therapy (P<0.01). Stimulation of conventional acupuncture points was not generally superior to needling ofnonspecific points on the neck, and both treatments were associated with improvement of symptoms. Needles inserted into the neck are likely to be an inappropriate sham control for acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine involving the insertion of needles through the skin at specific points on the body to achieve therapeutic effects and is an ancient Chinese art of healing. Using ancient scientific principles, acupuncture treats illnesses by bringing a person's body into harmony and regulating the balance of Yin and Yang. Balancing Yin and Yang is one basic principle of Chinese medicine, and balancing methods for combination of meridians and acupoints have been described throughout the history of Chinese medicine. Clinical observations and principal research on acupuncture focus on the adjustment of the Zang-Fu organ and have shown that the adjustment by acupuncture relied largely on the effective components in different organs. What does this effectiveness mean? In fact, is acupuncture a treatment that shows its effects with signals to the autocrine, paracrine and endocrine pathways? What role does embryology play in this area? Furthermore, molecular biology has opened avenues to newer methods for the study of embryology and to enhance our understanding of growth and development. Can evaluation of acupuncture with these branches of science be more scientific? We discuss this interesting topic in this original article. After all this time, it is reasonable that different therapeutic techniques and approaches are developed for acupuncture.",

The result showed that the mean impedance on the meridian and control points before the needling were 52.8 +/- 11.0 (omega) and 61.7 +/- 10.3 (omega) respectively which had significant difference (P<0.05). During the needling, impedance decreased significantly on the meridian by 9.2 +/- 5.6 (omega) (P<0.001) while impedance decreased by only 0.12 +/- 2.4 (omega) on control points without significance (P>0.05). The impedance changed back to 51.1 +/- 11.3 (omega) and 59.9 +/- 11.0 (omega) on the meridian and control points respectively during the 5-10 minutes after withdrawing the needling. In some cases, impedance changed intermittently during the needling. The experiment implies that interstitial fluid increases during the needling by axon reflection and blood capillary expanding which may be one of the mechanisms of acupuncture regulation.",

Nitric Oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA levels of rat hippocampus were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA markedly increased (P<0.01) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA significantly emerged during epilepsy, whereas no significant change in epithelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA was observed. EA inhibited the epilepsy and decreased nNOS (P<0.01) and iNOS (P<0.01) correspondingly but had no effect on the amount of eNOS mRNA. The data suggest that penicillin-induced epilepsy caused an increase in nNOS and iNOS, and the EA anticonvulsant effect might be related to the decrease of these nitric oxide synthases.",

A model is presented in which transmembrane currents open voltage-controlled calcium channels in fibroblast cells, causing ATP resynthesis, activation of protein kinase mechanisms to synthesize new cellular protein, and the DNA replication necessary for mitotic cell division.

Of these syncopal patients, 35 were male and 17 were female. Their mean age was 45 years (with a range of 11 to 72 years). All patients were in an upright position when needle fainting occurred.

When comparing the patients who experienced syncope during their first visit to our Clinic (Group I, n = 27) with the patients who experienced syncope in a follow-up treatment (Group II, n = 25; 3 patients had 2 episodes in sequential treatments), we found a significantly higher incidence of needle fainting (p less than 0.0001) in Group I patients (27 out of 2,855 or 0.94%) than in Group II patients (28 out of 25,430 or 0.11%).

Among them, 5 points on the midline of the palm represent the major acupoints of external genitals, bladder, abdominal aorta, stomach and heart, while the other 6 points were applied as supplementary ones (2 points on the mid line of the palm for adrenal glands and heart, 2 points near the wrist for kidneys and 2 points on the back of the hand for bladder). This basic treatment formula was applied to all subjects in the Experimental group. Additional treatments were given to the subjects with tenderness at ST27, CV4 or SP15, while no treatment to the subjects in Control group for 12 weeks. Assessment was made before and after 12 weeks of clinical study. In the present study, Hand acupuncture treatment significantly reduced the frequency of urinary incontinence compared to Control group. Similarly, the prevalence score of urinary incontinence was significantly reduced up to 37% of Control group in Experimental group. Furthermore, vaginal contraction pressure of the Experimental group was significantly increased 1.6 fold compared to Control group. In addition, Hand acupuncture treatment significantly improved the scores of making friends, sexual life and social community in Experimental group compared to Control group. Overall, these findings suggest that Hand acupuncture can be a potent alternative therapy for stress urinary incontinence.",

After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and patients' informed consent, 32 essential hypertensive patients aged between 32-65 and taking antihypertensive drugs were included to the study. A total of 10 sessions of manual acupuncture were applied on body acupoints (EX-HN3 (Yintang), KI 3, LIV 3, SP 9, LI 4, HT 7, ST 36, SP 6) in 10 weeks.

    "abstract": "A brief historical background on Autism &amp; some of the important symptoms associated with Autism are summarized. Using strong Electro Magnetic Field Resonance Phenomenon between 2 identical molecules with identical weight (which received U. S. Patent) non-invasively &amp; rapidly we can detect various molecules including neurotransmitters, bacteria, virus, fungus, metals &amp; abnormal molecules. Simple non- invasive measurement of various molecules through pupils &amp; head of diagnosed or suspected Autism patients indicated that in Autism patients following changes were often found: 1) Acetylcholine is markedly reduced; 2) Alzheimer's disease markers (i.e.β-Amyloid (1-42), Tau Protein, Apolipoprotein (Apo E4)) are markedly increased; 3) Chrysotile Asbestos is increased; 4) Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2 ) is moderately increased; 5) Al is moderately increased; 6) Hg is moderately increased; 7) Dopamine, Serotonin &amp; GABA are significantly reduced (up to about 1/10 of normal); 8) Often viral infections (such as CMV, HHV-6, HPV-16, HPV-18, etc.), and Bacterial infections (such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium TB, Borrelia Burgdorferi , etc.) coexist. Research by others on Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) shows that it is a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders, with about 70% of ASD patients also suffering from gastro-intestinal problems. While Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by formation of 1) Amyloid plaques, 2) Neurofibrillary tangles inside of neurons, and 3) Loss of connections between neurons. More than 90% of AD develops in people over the age of 65. These 3 characteristics often progressively worsen over time. Although Autism Spectrum Disorder and Alzheimer's disease are completely different diseases they have some similar biochemical changes. Eight examples of such measurement &amp; analysis are shown for comparison. Most of Autism patients improved significantly by removing the source or preventing intake of Asbestos, TiO 2 , Al &amp; Hg or enhancing urinary output of above abnormal substances &amp; coexisting infections, if treatment is given early. When HPV-16 &amp; HPV-18 coexist, at triangular central area of the top of head, in addition to inability to talk, severe neuromuscular problems of lower extremity were found to also exist. However, if treatment is given 3~4 years after onset of Autism symptoms, even when successful biochemical reduction of above abnormal substances occurs, clinical improvement is less significant, since permanent damage in brain tissue seems to already exist. Therefore, early diagnosis &amp; early treatment is very important for both Autism &amp; Alzheimer's disease. In addition the optimal doses of Vitamin D 3 and Taurine may play an important role in the future treatment of Autism, Alzheimer's Disease and memory disturbances by significantly increasing Acetylcholine and DHEA levels, enhancing the excretion of toxic substances in the urine, as well as having an anticancer effect.",

Design, setting, and main outcome measures: Adhesive biocapture tubes were attached to the skin surface along PC regions and injected with 2-Phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-3-oxide-1-oxyl solution, an NO-scavenging compound, contacting the skin surface for 20 minutes each during 4 consecutive biocapture intervals. TENS (1.0 mA, 6 Hz, 1.0 msec duration) was applied over acupoints PC 8 and PC 3 during the 2 nd biocapture for 20 min. Total nitrite and nitrate (NO x - ), the stable metabolic products of NO, and cGMP in biocaptured samples were quantified using chemiluminescence and ELISA. Results: NO x - levels in the 1 st biocapture over PC regions are almost two fold higher compared to subsequent biocaptures and are higher over PC acupoints versus non-meridian control region. Following TENS, NO x - concentrations over PC regions were significantly increased, and cGMP is predominantly released from the skin surface of PC acupoints. Conclusions: TENS induces elevations of NO-cGMP concentrations over local skin region with a high level at acupoints. The enhanced signal molecules improve local circulation, which contributes to beneficial effects of the therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although the opioid system plays a pivotal role in the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture (EA), it has been suggested that other peptidergic systems also may be involved in the therapeutic effect of EA. Among several peptides for EA-induced analgesia, catecholamine (CA) is associated with the descending pain inhibitory system. We evaluated whether the different frequencies of EA modified the cellular activity of central CA synthesizing neurons using double labeling immunohistochemistry between Fos-like immunoreactive (FLI) neurons and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons. We observed that different frequencies of EA increased the number of FLI neurons in catecholaminergic neurons, such as the dorsal raphe (DR), hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc), locus coeruleus (LC), A5 noradrenaline cells (A5), and A7 noradrenaline cells (A7). In addition, different frequencies of EA significantly increased the ratio of colocalization between FLI neurons and TH positive neurons in DR, LC and Arc. Only low frequency EA increased the neuronal activity in Arc. The ratio of double labeling between FLI and DBH positive neurons was also elevated at both LC and A5. These data demonstrate that different frequencies of EA increase the cellular activity of central CA synthesizing neurons, suggesting that the CA system plays an important role in EA-induced analgesia.",

    "abstract": "Patients in a family health center clinic were surveyed about their use of alternative/complementary medicine. These were mostly low-income individuals on Medicaid. The aim was to estimate prevalence and patterns of use of medically unconventional therapies such as chiropractic, homeopathy, and acupuncture in this population. Nearly two hundred patients (N = 199) filled out questionnaires inquiring about medical conditions and illnesses, personal health habits (physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, etc.), and use of preventive measures or therapies that are neither taught widely in US medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals, and which we refer to as 'alternative' therapies (ATs). The term 'alternative' is not intended to imply that ATs are necessarily chosen to replace, rather than to be used in combination with standard treatments, although that may indeed be so in specific cases. Twenty-nine percent of respondents (58/199) reported using at least one type of AT, as defined for the purposes of the survey. Frequency of use varied somewhat, with greatest AT use reported by those over 29 years of age with more education and higher incomes (p < 0.10, defined as chi 2 tests at p < 0.10). While no significant differences were found between AT users and nonusers with respect to exercise participation, alcohol intake or smoking, there was a difference with respect to the reporting of at least one medical condition (p < 0.01). Among those who have used ATs, 90% reported more than one medical condition. Of those reporting no AT use, 70% indicated only a single medical condition for which they had sought treatment. In conclusion, use of alternative therapy (AT) appears to be common in all socio-economic groups, although AT use is apparently slightly less among low-income persons than in the general population. It is therefore important for physicians and other medical providers to be aware that their patients may be using ATs. Obviously, such practices should be taken into account in case management.",

The involved muscles include trapezius, multifidi, splenius cervicis, levator scapulae, supraspinatus or infraspinatus. Acupuncture is a well-known method for relief of chronic pain. In this study, we evaluated the effect of acupuncture in MPS and its durability by using the concept of meridians. Twenty-nine patients with chronic MPS in the upper back and cervical regions received acupuncture 2 times per week for 3 weeks. According to the pathways of the meridians, we chose acupuncture points by the pain regions located in which parts of meridian passing (i.e. \"Where the meridian passes, where to treat the disease.\"). We evaluated the intensity of pain by visual analog scales (VAS) and active range of motion (ROM) of neck before and after therapy. After receiving acupuncture for 3 weeks, VAS of pain fell significantly from 9.0+/-1.0 to 4.9+/-2.5 and active ROM of neck significantly increased from 35.8+/-10.2 degrees to 61.3+/-9.4 degrees (p<0.05). The onset of symptom relief was gradual and duration of symptom relief after a course of acupuncture was average 5.3+/-1.2 days. In conclusion, acupuncture is a somewhat effective method for pain relief of patients with chronic MPS in the cervical and upper back regions. However, the effect of acupuncture with the concept of meridians on MPS is insidious and the duration of the relief is not long enough.",

The present report describes a similar study, using TNS treatment in attempts to accelerate healing of chronic leprous ulcers that had resisted treatment for several months or years. All other treatment, local and systemic chemotherapy, and daily regime remained as far as possible unaltered. The study was limited to ulceration in the soft tissue of the foot or lower leg. Eleven TNS sessions, each of 30 min duration, were applied per week. In 19 patients (6 out- and 13 in-patients), in whom the TNS treatment was not interrupted, all ulcers healed completely within a mean of 5.2 weeks (range 3-12 weeks). The mean size of the ulcers was 5.2 cu.cm (range 0.2-48.3 cu.cm), and they had persisted for a mean of 15.8 months (range 2-60 months). The 'healing index', i.e. the mean reduction of the ulcer cavity per week, was 1.0 cu.cm/week. The study demonstrates a clear therapeutic effect for low-frequency TNS in patients with leprous ulcers. The mechanisms involved in the accelerated healing are assumed to be increased microcirculation due to sympatho-inhibition and release of endogenous corticosteroids.",

Each meridian of specific internal organs was found to be connected to the organ representation area in the cerebral cortex of specific internal organs. The acupuncture point has an area and occupies 3-dimensional space. It has a circular or slightly oval boundary with diameter in the range of 3 mm to 2.7 cm, although 6-12 mm are the most common diameters in human adults, with the exception of the area outside the corners of the nailbeds of the fingers and toes. Using the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification Method\", the author also found that within the boundary of most acupuncture points and meridian lines (including Heart, Stomach, and Triple Burner) were high concentrations of neurotransmitters and hormones, including Acetylcholine, Methionine-Enkephalin, Beta-Endorphin, ACTH, Secretin, Cholecystokinin, Norepinephrine, Serotonin, and GABA. On all these meridian lines, in addition to the above neurotransmitters and hormones, Dopamine, Dynorphin 1-13, Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and VIP were found, but the latter do not usually exist within the boundary of the acupuncture point with the exception of the center midline of the acupuncture point where the meridian line is situated. Serotonin, Norepinephrine, and Cholecystokinin appeared in either one of the above 2 patterns, depending on the individual. Usually, no significant amounts of these neurotransmitters and hormones were found at the surrounding area outside of meridian and acupuncture points. However, the essential amino acid L-Tryptophan (which is a precursor of Serotonin), was usually found outside of the boundary of the acupuncture point and the meridian but not within the boundary of the acupuncture point and the meridian. Wherever Serotonin appeared, L-Tryptophan disappeared significantly and when the Serotonin disappeared, L-Tryptophan reappeared. In addition to the above common neurotransmitters and hormones, the Heart meridian had additional Atrial Natriuretic Peptide in both the meridian and its acupuncture points. Similarly, the Stomach meridian had additional Gastrin in both the meridian and its acupuncture points. Likewise,the Triple Burner meridian had additional Testosterone (in the male) and Estrogen (especially Estriol and Estradiol in the female.",

    "abstract": "This study was to observe the changes of the neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase (nNOS & iNOS) as well as their mRNAs in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of stress-induced hypertensive rats before and after acupuncture, and thereby to infer the curative mechanism of acupuncture on hypertension. The result indicated that the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of stress group rats was increased significantly (P < 0.01), it was accompanied that the expression of nNOS in the RVLM, including the immunoreactive neuron number (P < 0.05), the optical density (OD) (P < 0.01), and the mRNA (P < 0.01) were obviously elevated, while those of iNOS (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.01) were evidently lowered in the stress-induced hypertensive rats. Electroacupuncture (EA) points at \"Zusanli\" (St. 36) and \"Lanwei\" (Extra 37) on the same hindlimb were stimulated by an EA apparatus (Type G6805-2) with dense sparse wave (4-20Hz) and 4mA intensity. EA application could return the SBP (P < 0.05), and the changes on the expression of both nNOS and iNOS (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.01). These results suggest that the curative mechanism of acupuncture on stress-induced hypertension is related to the changes of nNOS and iNOS in the RVLM of rats.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of EA against cerebral ischemia whether influence IGF-1 expression following the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in monkeys. The results indicated that after occlusion of MCA, the IGF-1mRNA and protein expression was down-regulated. EA, given 15 minutes after occlusion of MCA and lasted for 1 h between the acupuncture points Baihui Point (GV. 20) and Renzhong Point (GV. 26) with a dense-sparse waveforms, which can be transformed into each other when dense or sparse wave is terminated, attenuated brain edema, decreased the infarct area, up-regulated IGF-1mRNA and protein expression. These results implied that EA is effective to extenuate cerebral ischemic injuries and up-regulating the endogenous IGF-1 expression following MCA occlusion in monkeys, which might be an important mechanism of neuroprotective effects of EA against cerebral ischemia.",

    "abstract": "There are many causes of frequent urination. Whenever water or fluids are consumed, the patient has to urinate within 10 or 20 min. Often urinary bladder examinations & blood tests show no significant abnormalities, & treatment by anti-bacterial or anti-viral agents does not improve the symptoms significantly. In intractable frequent urination with difficulty holding urine, as well as other intractable medical problems such as frequent coughing, white pus in gingiva, infection of the apex of a root canalled tooth, slow-healing wounds, & ALS, the authors often found coexisting mixed infections of Candida albicans (C.A.), Helicobacter pylori (H.P.), & Cytomegalovirus (CMV) with or without additional bacterial (Chlamydia trachomatis, etc.) or viral infections & increased Asbestos, with or without Hg deposits. We often found various degrees of mixed infections with C.A., H.P., & CMV in the external sphincters of the urethra & in the Trigone of the urinary bladder which consists of (1) a horizontal, band-like area between the 2 ureter openings & (2) the funnel shaped part of the Trigone at the lower half of the urinary bladder. In the coexistence of significant amounts of C.A., H.P. & CMV, the infection cannot be reduced by otherwise effective medicines for H.P. & CMV. However, one optimal dose of Diflucan, or Caprylic acid taken orally or externally applied, rapidly reduced the symptoms significantly. We found the best treatment is to give a combination of an optimal dose of Caprylic acid orally in the form of \"CaprilyCare\" or \"Caprylic Acid,\" with a capsule of Omega-3 Fish Oil as an anti-viral agent, Amoxicillin, Substance Z & a Cilantro tablet. We found that an optimal dose of Caprylic acid increases normal cell telomere (NCT) to a desirable 750 ng BDORT units while Diflucan increases NCT by only 25 ng BDORT units, & with Omega-3 fish oil, leads to a mutual cancellation of both drugs. Thus, Caprylic acid is superior to & less expensive than Diflucan, & has potential application for anti-cancer, anti-aging, anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-Autism, anti-infection, & general circulatory improvement.",

Both groups were treated once a week for 8 weeks and needles were stimulated manually. The severity of pain was evaluated with the Migraine Index and the visual analogue of Scott-Huskisson; other 2 tests were used to monitor the pain threshold and Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale was applied to assess variations in patients' mood. These tests were performed before the beginning and at the end of treatment and, for the follow up, after 1, 3 and 6 months from the end of therapy. On the basis of the migraine index, pain at the end of therapy was significantly lower than before the treatment, being residual pain 54.83% and 63.43%, respectively for somatic and ear acupuncture. Apparently, the 2 treatments were equally effective, as no significant difference could be assessed. On the contrary, a significant difference between the 2 groups was clear during the follow up: in fact, after 6 months residual pain was 16.80% and 48.83% for somatic and ear acupuncture, respectively (p=0.038). These results were confirmed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) test and by the evaluation of pain threshold. It is noteworthy that also Zung's depression test showed a significant decrease of score was present in both groups, at all the times investigated with no difference between the two treatments. These results, though preliminary, are quite promising in supporting the effectiveness of ear acupuncture for treatment of migraine without aura.",

    "abstract": "Tibetan medicine is known as the knowledge of healing in the Four Tantras , the main medical text studied by Tibetan doctors. In the 8th century, King Trisong Deutsen (718-785 CE) invited eminent physicians from India, China, Persia, East Turkestan, Mongolia, and Nepal for the First International Medical Symposium in Samye, Tibet and ordered his personal physician Elder Yuthog Yonten Gonpo (708-833 CE), who lived 125 years, and participated in this conference to summarize. By combining all the information available and presented during this symposium, he compiled the Four Tantras . He established the Tanadug medical school at Menlung in Kongpo, Southern Tibet in 763 CE, and worked for the propagation of Tibetan medicine. He is considered an emanation of Medicine Buddha, who is a symbol of mental and physical well being. In his left hand, the Medicine Buddha clasps a begging bowl with long-life nectar, signifying immortality, and in his right, the Chebulic myrobalan (Haritaki), a symbol of good health. Chebulic myrobalan , Belleric myrobalan , and Emblic myrobalan are together called the \"3 Fruits\" and are common ingredients in Tibetan medicines. Prof. Omura, Y of NY Medical College evaluated these \"3 Fruits\" and found that one of them available as a \"Haritaki,\" had the highest normal cell telomere increasing effect by optimal dose, with improvement of circulation all over the body, which in turn inhibits cancer activity. He considered Tibetan medicine to be the most advanced medicine in the world before the 19th Century with its well-organized systematic method as described by colorful Tibetan medical paintings by Sangye Gyamtso (1653-1705 CE). During a typical diagnosis, the physician examines the patients' tongue, radial arteries for pulse beats by the index, middle, and ring fingers of both hands and the urine for features like color, vapor, and bubbles, etc.",

    "abstract": "Microwave Resonance Therapy (MRT) is a novel medical treatment, which represents a synthesis of the ancient Chinese traditional knowledge in medicine (acupuncture) and recent breakthroughs in biophysics. By affecting the appropriate acupuncture points by the generation of high frequency microwaves (52-78 GHz), remarkable clinical results are being achieved in surgery, orthopedic and traumatology, cardiovascular disorders, urology, gynecology, dermatology, gastroenterology, pulmology, upper respiratory tract, cardiology, neurology, and oncology during the last decade--the MRT being contraindicated only in the cases of acute pain in the abdomen demanding an operation, pregnancy, and menstruation cycle. In this paper the quantum-like macroscopic biophysical basis of the MRT and its technical details are elaborated too, offering a new insight in the mechanisms of the assembling gap junction hemichannels upon the internal microwave (MW) electromagnetic field spatio-temporal maximums at the temporary position of the acupuncture system, and, hence, the very biophysical nature of the temporary psychosomatic health or disease. The quantum-like coherent characteristics of the MRT (sharply-resonant sensory response of the disordered organism, extremely low-intensity and low-energy non-thermal biologically efficient MW radiation, and negligible MW energy losses down acupuncture meridians) might be viewed as a consequence of the existence of biological nonlocal selfconsistent macroscopic quantum potentials, which can give rise to nonlinear coherent EM MW long-range maser-like excitations of biological nonlinear absorption medium with the cells as active centers--with acupuncture meridians related to eigenfrequencies and spatio-temporal eigenwaves distributions of every individual biological quantum system. This suggests that a healthy condition might be considered as an absolute minimum (ground state) of the nonlocal selfconsistent macroscopic quantum potential of the organism. Some disorders of an acupuncture system correspond to higher minimums of the (spatio-temporally changeable) potential hypersurface in energy-configuration space, which possibly explains the higher sensory responses of the more excited (more disordered) acupuncture system and the poor MRT sensory response of the healthy acupuncture system being already in the ground state. Such a picture also supports the EM/ionic \"optical\" ultralowfrequency modulated MW quantum holographic neural network-like function of the acupuncture system (similar to complex-valued oscillatory holographic Hopfield-like neural networks), and its essential relation to consciousness, as strongly suggested from biophysical modeling of altered states of consciousness. Finally, the ionic aspects of the acupuncture system are considered, too, as well as the relation of ultradian (approximately 2-hour) nasal rhythm recognized in Indian swara yoga and circadian (approximately 24-hour) acupuncture rhythm recognized in Chinese traditional medicine, and their significance for maintaining the ionic balance within acupuncture system, as related to overall health.",

Forty-nine patients were candidates for coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), whereas bypass grafting was rejected in the remaining 20 patients. We compared our endpoint findings with those of a large prospective, randomized trial comparing CABG with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The incidence of death and myocardial infarction was 21% among the patients undergoing CABG, 15% among the patients undergoing PTCA and 7% among our patients. No significant difference was found concerning pain relief between the three groups. Invasive treatment was postponed in 61% of our patients due to clinical improvement, and the annual number of in-hospital days was reduced by 90%, bringing about an estimated economic saving of 12,000 US $ for each of our patients. Despite the fact that the men in the present study, had significantly less positive expectations towards the outcome of the treatment, when compared to the women, there was no significant difference concerning the effect.

About a quarter (14 patients) of them had a clearance of about two thirds of the skin lesions. Eight of them had a clearance of one third of the skin lesions. Nine patients had minimal or no improvement. Our experience indicates that acupuncture is induced an effective therapeutic modality for psoriasis, particularly when the western medical management is unsuccessful. We speculated about the possible involvement of the cutaneous reticuloendothelial system in the clearance of the skin lesions.",

No significant influence from patient expectation, social stress (strain) or profiles of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was found (all p > 0.1). Acupuncture slightly increased exercise tolerance (median 7%), the difference in Systolic Blood Pressure-Heart Rate Product between rest and maximal exercise (delta PRP) (median 3%), and the time to onset of pain (median 10%); decreased nitroglycerin consumption (median 58%) and anginal attack rate (median 38%). Improvement in exercise tolerance was significantly correlated to an improvement in delta PRP (correlation coefficient = 0.7; p < 0.0001) but not to time of myocardial ischemia (correlation coefficient = 0.1; p = 0.1). Compared with 28 patients with a less pronounced anti-anginal effect, the 21 patients with a pronounced effect had a significant increase in local skin temperature, but had no significant change in distant skin temperature and pain thresholds.

Acupuncture is an ancient procedure with empirical effects on pain. Previous studies established the increased output of messengers at neuronal junctions in spinal cord and hypothalamic locations, especially of endorphins which inhibit the perception of pain. We treated several painful symptoms with acupuncture and evaluated the outcome of the treatment. Patients with various kinds of therapy-refractory pain and patients in whom conventional treatment methods could not be applied were included in the study. The diagnoses included glaucoma. Tolosa-Hunt-Syndrome, ophthalmic migraine, blepharospasm, and dry eyes. In one case acupuncture was used for analgesia during surgery. Acupuncture was performed with sterile disposable needles, at points known to have an empirical analgesic effect. The stimulation was adapted to the patient's individual needs. VAS assessments before and after acupuncture were compared. The t-test was used for statistical evaluation. Acupuncture had no side effects, but reduced pain to a variable extent. Especially in cases of severe pain and in surgery, very effective pain reduction was achieved. In general, pain was significantly reduced in all patients by the use of acupuncture. A statistically significant effect was noted (p < 0.05). Further studies should be conducted to demonstrate the specific effect in larger patient populations. Monitoring neurotransmitter activity will possibly help to illustrate the effect.",

    "abstract": "Although the central mechanisms of electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA) have been investigated, a systematic study for the involvement of neuronal populations of central nervous system (CNS) in EAA has not been well undertaken, largely due to the difficulty in tracing the neuronal pathways by traditional techniques. Recently developed c-fos expression examination by immunohistochemical method with Ab-1 antisera might be used for this purpose as a useful marker for neuronal activity in CNS. In this study, tail flick latency (TFL) was tested as an index of pain threshold in conscious rats. After unilateral electroacupuncture was applied at 'Zuan-san-li' and 'Huan-tiao', the TFL was significantly prolonged. To explore the possible involvement of certain neuronal groups of central nervous system in EAA, we examined the EAA accompanied c-fos expression throughout the neuraxis, and a lot of specific c-fos protein labelled neurons were found in lumbar spinal cord (laminae I and II), nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe dorsalis, substantia grisea centralis, nucleus habenulae lateralis, nucleus habenulae medialis, nucleus medialis thalami, nucleus lateralis hypothalami, nucleus supramamillaris, nucleus supraopticus, nucleus arcuatus, nucleus preopticus medialis, nucleus amygdala, nucleus tractus diagonalis, etc. No obvious c-fos expression was shown in these areas on control rats. These results strongly suggested that the functional activation of above-mentioned nuclei by electroacupuncture was underlied in EAA action.",

Results in the literature are still contradictory as to the degree and specificity of acupuncture analgesia and its opioid nature. Acupuncture techniques as well as experimental pain models are factors accounting for the discrepancies in the results. For this reason, we designed an experimental pain test characterized by a high degree of specificity, validity and reliability. We chose optimal conditions for eliciting specific acupuncture effect, i.e. non-segmental, low frequency and painful intensity range. A cross-over repeated measure experimental design was used. Five normal trained subjects participated in 65 sessions under four conditions (control, EA, EA+naloxone, EA+placebo). Changes in experimental dental pain thresholds served as indices of analgesia. The results indicated a 27% pain threshold increase after 30 minutes of EA stimulation (p less than .0001), with no differential effect between pain detection (mild pain sensation) and pain discomfort (strong pain sensation). This increase was partially blocked by the double blind injection of 0.8 mg naloxone IM (p less than .005). The experiment was designed in such a way as to prevent the occurrence of a stress analgesic effect. The endogenous opioid system was shown to be partially involved in acupuncture analgesia. Other mechanisms of action are discussed in view of the literature findings.",

We recruited 24 male medical students for this study. They were randomized into 3 groups: control group (without acupuncture during the study period, n=7), LI.11 group (EA at LI.11 acupoint, n=9) and LI.10 group (EA at LI.10 acupoint, n=8). At the first day (Day 1), blood was taken from all subjects. But EA was applied to the LI.11 and LI.10 group immediately after blood drawing. On the second day (Day 2), EA was applied to the LI.11 and LI.10 group right before blood sample was taken. At the fourteenth day (Day 14), blood sample was taken for all subjects. The parameters of EA were 4 sec alternating intervals of 2 and 15 HZ (dense and disperse) and 1-4 mA in intensity for 20 min. The waveform of electrical impulse was bi-directional and pulse duration of 50 microsec. Blood analysis included flow cytometry for lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4 and CD8 positive cell percentages) and ELISA for cytokines [soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interferon (INF)-gamma, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10]. We treated the result of Day 1 as a baseline value. After EA at acupoint LI.11, CD4 positive cell percentage at Day 14 showed significant decrease compared to the baseline value (p = 0.011). CD8 positive cell percentage also decreased at Day 2 (p = 0.038) and Day 14 (p= 0.015). In the LI.10 group, CD4 and CD8 levels at Day 14 were decreased significantly (CD4, p = 0.012; CD8, p = 0.017). Results of all cytokines concentrations of the LI.11 group did not change during the study period. But the serum level of sIL-2R of the LI.10 group at Day 14 was higher than the baseline value (p = 0.018). The serum level of IL-6 at Day 14 was lower than the baseline value (p = 0.028). The serum level of IL-4 at Day 2 was lower than the baseline value (p = 0.025). Our results showed that LI.11 and LI.10 acupoints cause a similar decrease of CD4 and CD8 populations. Increase of serum sIL-2R and decrease of serum IL-4 and IL-6 were observed when EA was applied at LI.10 acupoint, but not at LI.11 acupoint. In this study, we can understand that EA may modulate the peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations and serum cytokine levels of the immune system.",

The sedation level was assessed by a SEF 95 value under normal conditions, sedation being induced by a sedative, a combination of a sedative and acupuncture, and acupuncture release. During the sedative and acupuncture combination, the SEF 95 values significantly decreased in the butorphanol group.

Fifty female obese patients were randomized into 2 groups; a Body Acupuncture Group (GBA; n=25) and an Auricular Acupuncture Group (GAA; n=25). All patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Their anthropometric measurements (body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, waist circumference and hip circumference) were recorded for analysis in every 15 days. Patients were compared in terms of anthropometric measurements. Patients in the GAA received 6 sessions of auricular acupuncture in every 15 days. We used bilateral 2 points namely antiaggression point and stomach point for auricular acupuncture. Bilateral LI4, LI11, ST25, ST36, SP6, SP9, CV12, and CV6 points were selected for two times in a week (totally 24 sessions) in the GBA. Independent samples t test, Mann Whitney U test and paired samples t-test were used in the comparisons. Significance level was set at p&lt;0.05. Seventeen patients in GBA and 21 patients in GAA completed the study. The mean age of patients was 36.2±10.5 years (GBA: 32.7±12.3; GAA: 39.1±7.9). The mean weight was 95.7±11.8 kg before acupuncture, and it decreased to 92.5±14.4 kg after acupuncture in GBA; and it was 95.1±15.6 kg before acupuncture and it decreased to 91.5±11.0 kg after acupuncture in GAA. Change in weight after acupuncture was 2.6±2.4 kg in GBA, and 4.2±3.4 kg in GAA (p&lt;0.05). In both groups, changes in weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, waist circumference, and hip circumference were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Only one patient reported side effect related to acupuncture. Body acupuncture and auricular acupuncture have the therapeutic role in the management of obesity. In this study, auricular acupuncture is more effective in reducing body weight than body acupuncture. Thus, auricular acupuncture may be useful and safe, nonpharmacological treatment.",

One impediment to this endeavor is the lack of an objective and reliable method for identifying the hypothesized active and control points. In order to address this issue, we conducted two studies employing a constant current electrical device and a novel probing technique. In the first study, we assessed the reliability of our technique for measuring electrical skin resistance points (acupuncture or non-acupuncture) on the body and auricles. In the second study, we analyzed and compared the measurements of skin resistance of auricular acupuncture and control zones in a group of cocaine abusing patients. Findings suggest that our measurement method produced reliable measurements, and that active acupuncture zones revealed a significantly different pattern of electrical skin resistance readings compared to control zones. This method may be useful for locating active and control points in controlled clinical trials of auricular acupuncture.",

The results showed that electrical stimulation of the RPGL could increase the pain threshold and enhance the effect of AA, whereas lesion of the RPGL reduce the effect of AA. Microinjection of naloxone (5 micrograms/0.5ul/2min) into the RPGL could partially reverse the effect of AA and the reversal effect of naloxone was dose-dependent. The release of leu-enkephalin (LEK) and B-endorphin (B-EP) from the RPGL in the electrical acupuncture (EA) group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There were positive correlations between the changes of release of LEK, B-EP and the increase of pain threshold. The results mentioned above imply that the RPGL plays an important role in AA.

Our results indicated that MT level was elevated in pineal and hippocampus, and first had no change then significantly evaluated in serum during seizure crisis. The elevation of MT level was greatly potentiated with 30 min EA treatment (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the degree of seizures and the increases of EEG RP induced by seizures were significantly reduced (P<0.05). Because MT was considered as an antistressor and a natural downregulator of epileptiform activity, we postulate that the elevation in MT level during seizures may be one endogenous mechanism that counteracts convulsions and seizure-induced stress. A further elevation of MT levels with EA treatment suggests that MT might be one of the possible mediums of EA anti-seizures.",

Recent research found that cerebral serotonin has anti-depressant and analgesic effects. It was reported that cerebral serotonin can be released by the stimulation of certain acupuncture loci. Omura reported that the stimulation of ST36 and GB20 increased intracephalic blood flow. Increasing intracephalic blood flow may indirectly increase the quantity of serotonin released. The release of serotonin can be enhanced further by sequential stimulation of these acupuncture loci. A marked degree of mental relaxation by SEA was shown in this study of 85 clinical cases of chronic physical disorders, e.g. intractable pain, headache, with most disorders complicated by reactive depression. Some of the cases were psycho-somatic disorders. The percentage of improvement from slight to remarkable between mental disorders (78.8%) and physical disorders (77.1%) is about equal.

    "abstract": "The potential role of taurine on epilepsy and acupuncture anti-convulsion was addressed in the present study. Epilepsy was induced by micro-injection of penicillin into hippocampus of Wistar rats. Taurine was applied by intraperitioneal (i.p.) injection. Electro-acupuncture (EA) was performed on acupoints of DU 20 \"Bai Hui\" and DU 16 \"Feng Fu\" along DU channel. Epileptic grades were evaluated by electro-encephalography (EEG) and behavior score. We featured the dose-response relationship between taurine-treated epilepsy and epilepsy-only subjects, detected the effect of exogenous taurine on epilepsy and acupuncture treatment, and investigated taurine transporter immuno-activity in hippocampus using immunohistochemistry. It was found that: 1), taurine had a significant antiepileptic effect as applied at i.p. 20 mg/kg, 40mg/kg, 80mg/kg, especially at 40mg/kg in the rat model of penicillin-induced seizure. Animals were improved by one to three Racine grades in behavior and in frequency and amplitude of EEG. 2), Exogenous taurine enhanced the anti-convulsive effect of EA. Both behavior and EEG were improved in taurine-treated rats. EA inhibited epilepsy. Exogenous taurine improved epilepsy in a synergistic manner to EA. 3), EA increased the concentration of taurine transporter in hippocampus by comparing EA-treated epilepsy with normal control and penicillin only, or EA-treated plus taurine-treated epilepsy with taurine-treated only epilepsy and penicillin only. The resulting data suggested that taurine may play an inhibitory role against epilepsy as an inhibitory amino acid in the central nervous system and EA may inhibit epilepsy via upregulating the concentration of taurine transporter to increase the release of taurine.",

    "abstract": "To study the relationship between the opioid peptidergic system (OPS) and acupuncture analgesia (AA), observations have been made both at presynaptic levels and receptor sites in our college since 1975. It was found that AA could be reversed by naloxone in rabbits and in man. The opioid peptide activity increased in human cerebrospinal fluid and in the perfusate from certain brain areas during AA, as revealed by radio-receptor assay. The results indicate that OPS takes an active part in AA. To study further the activity of OPS, experiments were done at the level of nerve cells on rabbits's central gray (PAG). By using multimicropipettes for extracellular recording and iontophoresis of drugs, it was found that opiates produced a naloxone reversible inhibition on the spontaneous discharge of certain neurones. Such neurones were distributed mostly in the ventral part of the PAG. Similar to iontophoretic opiates, electroacupuncture (EA) had an inhibitory effect on PAG neurones and the inhibition could be reversed by iontophoretic naloxone. A correlation existed between the effects of EA and opiates (P less than 0.0174). EA and opiates also showed similar inhibitory effect on nociceptive response of PAG neurones. It was postulated that acupuncture signals activate the brain OPS to exert a double control over the transmission of pain sensation in the PAG, i.e., to block the conveyance of nociceptive impulses at situ and at other relay stations through inhibitory systems. In addition to the PAG, most brain areas important in AA are interrelated to OPS, and the interaction between opioid peptides and opiate receptors in these areas perform an analgesic function as a whole.",

Osteoarthrosis of major joints, and backache, responded less favourably. In total 65% of those patients who had taken analgesics before acupuncture therapy, either stopped totally or reduced their dose considerably.

It produced clinically adequate analgesia in 19 women (63.3%). 6 women in this group (31.6%) reported that they had experienced no pain whatsoever throughout the period of labour and delivery (average duration - 8 hours). 11 women (36.7%) had no pain relief and required pethidine injection when sacral acupuncture proved ineffective. 24 women (80%), including 5 who did not obtain relief, indicated their wish to have sacral acupuncture during their next confinement. 2 women (6.7%) objected to needling, 3 considered acupuncture useless while another 2 did not believe in it. The patients' cardio-respiratory functions and uterine contractions were not adversely affected. There were no untoward effects on the mothers or their neonates. The procedure was technically simple, the equipment light and cheap. The needles did not interfere with nursing or obstetric manouvres. The procedure was however time consuming. The results were inconsistent and unpredictable. Despite these limitations, the simplicity, cheapness and absence of physiological complications associated with the procedure, make it a worthwhile medical armament for pain relief in the Nigerian environment, with limited resources and specialized manpower.",

    "abstract": "Electro-acupuncture (EA) partially inhibited epilepsy with great success. The biological basis underlying EA anti-convulsion remained uncertain, which resulted in limited application and slow improvement of acupuncture. Our previous study indicated that taurine may play an inhibitory role against epilepsy as an inhibitory amino acid in the central nervous system and EA may inhibit epilepsy via up-regulating the expression of taurine transporter to increase the release of taurine. Involvement of taurine in kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy and anti-convulsion of EA was further addressed on taurine deficiency animal in the present work. We instituted endogenous taurine-deficiency model by supplementation of beta-alanine (3%) in drinking water for continuous 10 days initially, injected KA into lateral cerebral ventricle to induce epileptic seizure, and performed EA treatment on DU26 \"RenZhong\" and K \"YongQuan\" acupoints by an EA apparatus (Model G6805-2) using successive waves with the frequency 64Hz and the current intensity 0.8-1.0 mA for 30 minutes in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Taurine levels markedly decreased in cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum of rats after beta-alanine administration by fluore-HPLC measurement. EA alleviated epileptic activity in rats at 3.5 h time point after KA injection, whereas beta-alanine-induced taurine depletion rendered rats more susceptible to KA-induced epilepsy. Taurine transporter level increased after EA treatment. These results suggested that taurine participated in epileptogenesis and EA may be related to taurine in controlling epileptic seizure.",

    "abstract": "Phenytoin is an anti-convulsant and anti-arrhythmic medication. Manufactured by various pharmaceutical companies with various brand names, phenytoin (PHT) is also known as Dilantain, Hydantoin or Phenytek in the United States; Dilantain or Remytoine in Canada; Epamin, Hidantoina in Mexico; and Fenidatoin or Fenitron or other names elsewhere in the world. Phenytoin (PHT) is especially useful for patients suffering from intractable oral and facial pain especially those who exhibit anger, stress, depression and irrational emotions commonly seen in the patients with oral and facial pain. When used properly, Phenytoin is also an effective anxiolysis drug in addition to its theraputic effects on pain and can be used alone or, even better, if combined with other compatible sedatives. Phenytoin is particularly valuable when combined with acupuncture for patients with trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyneal neuralgia, Bell's palsy, and some other facial paralysis and pain. It also has an advantage of keeping the patient relatively lucid after treatment. Either PHT or acupuncture alone can benefit patients but the success of treatment outcome may be limited. We found by combining both acupuncture and PHT with Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement by stimulating middle finger at the first segment of ventral (palmar) and lateral surfaces, as well as prescribing PHT with the dosage predetermined for each patient by Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT), the treatment outcome was much better resulted with less recurrence and intensity of pain during episodes of attack. Patients with Bell's palsy were most benefited by acupuncture therapy that could completely get rid of the illness.",

But little is known about the electricity effect between electro-acupuncture and pulsed radiofrequency. The objective of this study is to assess the difference in effectiveness of pain relief between pulsed radiofrequency and electro-acupuncture. Visual analog score (VAS) pain score, the Oswestry disability index (ODI) to measure a patient's permanent functional disability, and Short form 36 (SF-36) which is a survey used in health assessment to determine the cost-effectiveness of a health treatment, were used as rating systems to measure the pain relief and functional improvement effect of pulsed radiofrequency and electro-acupuncture, based on the methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials, the relevance between the study groups, and the consistency of the outcome evaluation. First, the baseline status before therapy shows no age and gender influence in the SF-36 and VAS score but it is significant in the ODI questionnaire. From ANOVA analyses, it is apparent that radiofrequency therapy is a significant improvement over electro-acupuncture therapy after one month. But electro-acupuncture also showed functional improvement in the lumbar spine from the ODI. This study provides sufficient evidence of the superiority of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy for low back pain relief compared with both electro-acupuncture (EA) therapy and the control group. But the functional improvement of the lumbar spine was proved under EA therapy only. Both therapies are related to electricity effects.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Tremor is a clinically depicted commonly encountered neurological disorder which results after a stroke or brain injury like Parkinson's disease which causes rhythmic and reflex oscillatory movement of a body, particularly upper arm, which is difficult to diagnose and manage. Tremor is influenced by Physiological and Psychological factors which can affect any age group specifically in middle age and older persons. The modern treatment facilities and features available are very expensive and unreachable for rural people. Hence there arises a necessity to develop a portable device to overcome such situations. Methods: This paper introduces a portable and wearable device using accelerometer sensor assisted with pneumatic mechanism for tremor suppression in the upper arm. This portable device may help to suppress tremor and improve muscle control and coordination in the upper arm. Once the device is connected with the patients arm, the pneumatic circuit supplies required air through the hand cuff to keep the arm on control with reference to the signal obtained from the accelerometer sensor. The results: The performances of the device are measured in three different stages say before inflation, during partial inflation and full inflation. The results depicts 30% of improvement in tremor suppression at three different levels of tremor occurrence which is measured in terms of voltage between 1.6 and 2V at high, medium and low levels at different time intervals with frequency &lt;10Hz. Conclusion: This device is a cost effective and portable closed loop system which is exclusively designed to reduce the tremor without affecting the upper limb voluntary movements.",

For comparison, a group of healthy subjects made up of 116 men and 277 women was also used. As soon as we revealed the influence of factors of pathology with a high significance level and gender and the interaction “gender*pathology”, all the results are described separately for groups of men and women and for groups with IDDM and NIDDM. Simple effects of paired comparisons between healthy subjects, IDDM and NIDDM in groups of men and women, as well as comparisons between the profiles of men and women with IDDM and NIDDM showed significant differences between ACs in healthy subjects and those with each type of diabetes. The most significant differences are seen in the AC connected with the digestive system (SP pancreas channel), LR (liver channel), ST (stomach channel), GB (gall bladder channel). Thus, we revealed characteristic pattern of acupuncture channels (AC) lesions inherent to diabetes pathology, i.e.most vulnerable in diabetes ACs, being compromised in dependence from such factors, as type of diabetes, hyper or hypoglycemia, and from gender. The main value of the method lies in the fact that we observe the entire food chain from food ingestion to the utilization of carbohydrates with the opportunity to assess the activity of each organ and its regulatory contribution. On the basis of the body's response, an individual selection of medicines can be made, and by evaluating the individual biorhythms it is possible to determine the optimal time of administration.",

The results indicate that gross neuronal damages include infarction, swelling and neuron loss, accompanied by increased bFGF-like IR expression following MCAO. In peri-infarct striatum, bFGF-like IR was mainly located in astrocytes except some neurons also showed an upregulation of the IR; in frontoparietal cortex, strong induction of bFGF-like IR was mostly seen in neurons. Both the EA applied during ischemia and reperfusion could evidently alleviate cerebral lesion extent, notably upregulate the expression of bFGF-like IR in striatum and cortex, but there was no significant difference between the effects of EA applied during ischemia and reperfusion, except EA applied during reperfusion seems to be more effective in reducing the cerebral swelling. The results implied that, in striatum, astrocytes might play an important role in the protection of neuron via the expression of bFGF; whereas in cortex, neurons may exert autoprotection through secreting bFGF themselves. One possible protective effect of EA lies in regulating the endogenous expression of bFGF.",

In order to examine the effects of acupuncture, two experiments were performed. Experiment 1: Eighteen female mice (strain; C57BL/6) at the age of 7 weeks were divided three groups, (a) sham operated (control; n=6), (b) ovariectomized (OVX; n=6), and (c) ovariectomized and stimulated by subcutaneous needles on acupuncture point, Shenshu (BL23) at the both sides of the back for 20 days (OVX+Acu; n=6). These animals were sacrificed at 20 days after needle insertion, and the splenic lymphoid cells were examined by two-color flow cytometry, using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the cell surface antigens, CD3, CD4, CD8a and NK1.1 (CD56). In the ovariectomized (OVX) group, the peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly increased and the ratio of natural killer (NK) cells (CD3-NK1.1+; CD3 negative, NK1.1 positive) to T lymphocytes was decreased compared to the sham control group. In the ovariectomized with needle insertion (OVX+Acu) group, the CD4/CD8 ratio was reduced, but the NK cells ratio was not changed compared to the OVX group. Experiment 2: To investigate the acute effects of subcutaneous needle insertion, male C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks old) were used (n=6, each group). The acupuncture points Shen-shu (BL23) on the backs of the male mice were also stimulated by subcutaneous needles for 3 and 7 days. As a result, the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly decreased at day 3 and day 7, compared to the control group. On the other hand the NK cells ratio and activated T-cells were increased at day 7. The mitogenic activities in the splenic lymphocytes were also increased by acupuncture stimulation at day 3. Catecholamine contents in the hippocampus were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with the electro-chemical detector (ECD-HPLC) method. No significant change was observed in either dopamine contents or norepinephrine; however, dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA) and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) were increased at day 3. The study suggests that acupuncture has effects on peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations and may modulate mitogenic activity. In addition, acupuncture may stimulate dopamine turnover.",

    "abstract": "The authors found that antibiotics used to treat various infections often were ineffective in the presence of abnormal localized deposits of heavy metals like Hg and Pb, which were often observed to co-exist with Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes Simplex Types I & II, Cytomegalovirus(CMV), and other micro-organisms. Our earlier research revealed that despite rigorous treatment with antibiotics together with various drug uptake enhancement techniques, subjects who had been treated for Chlamydia trachomatis infections, seemingly successfully with disappearance of their symptoms, were often experiencing recurrences within several months after completion of their treatment despite taking precautions against reinfection. Careful examination of the entire body of these symptom-free patients with the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test revealed that the Chlamydia trachomatis had retreated to 3 approximately 5 hiding places with localized increase in uric acid levels: 1) sublingual caruncle, 2) a small round area in the right and/or left axillae, 3) the genitals (Corona Glandis area of the Glans Penis at the Fossa Navicularis of the urethra in the male, and near the orifice of the urethra in the female), 4) Insulin-like Growth Factor positive horizontal lines, particularly above and below the knees, 5) the maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses and the horizontal lines at the base of the nostrils (particularly small areas where Insulin-like Growth Factors exist). We found that all these areas contain Insulin-like Growth Factors I & II which are reduced in the presence of infection. Even when drug uptake of antibiotics was selectively increased in these 3 approximately 5 areas by various drug uptake enhancement methods developed by the 1st author, still the infection persisted. In the spring of 1995, use of Chinese parsley for successful elimination of Hg deposits existing in various organs of the first author as the result of the decay of radioactive Thallium 201 injected for cardiac SPECT, was accidentally discovered after eating Vietnamese soup, which happened to contain Chinese parsley, also called cilantro. We also found Chinese parsley accelerates the excretion of Hg, Pb, and A1 from the body though the urine. Our subjects were given a course of antibiotics (Doxycycline for Chlamydia trachomatis infection) or anti-viral agents (EPA with DHA for Herpes Family Viruses) together with Chinese parsley. Since these vegetable/herbs were eaten, the amount of effective substance absorbed varied and some people did not like the taste of these relatively large amounts of either cooked or raw parsley or its juice, but together with effective antibiotics delivered by drug uptake enhancement methods to the infected areas, the substances worked synergistically, rapidly reducing the generalized symptoms and infection. The micro-organisms retreated to the 3 approximately 5 areas listed above where, with continued treatment, they were significantly reduced, but not completely eliminated. Because of these problems, a pharmaceutical company was asked to produce a Chinese parsley table containing a controlled amount in a highly absorbable form. When 11 subjects were treated with Doxycycline for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, or anti-viral agents (EPA with DHA) for Herpes Family Viruses, drug uptake enhancement methods to selectively increase delivery of the drugs to the affected areas, and Chinese parsley tablets to remove the heavy metal deposits, the last traces of the infections and clinical symptoms disappeared completely. Therefore we hypothesized that the infectious micro-organisms mentioned above, somehow utilize the Hg or Pb to protect themselves from what would otherwise be effective antibiotics, and/or that heavy metal deposits in some way make antibiotics ineffective. Since the micro-organisms retreat to areas in which Insulin-like Growth Factors I & II normally exist, they may be utilizing them for their own growth and multiplication. These phenomena ma",

Our thermal imaging system that is the most sensitive to 10um long infrared wavelength allows us to recognize the actual location of acupuncture point and analyze its functional condition by examining the temperature gradient between the point and its surrounding skin area. The temperature perception of acupuncture point on extremities is especially important since its location and functional condition have a tendency to be altered if one contract disease such as immunodeficiency, arterial hypertension, and dyskinesia of biliary ducts. Also, thermovisual examinations over the acupuncture points allow us to perform the objective medical treatments by observing the transition of temperature gradients.",

A pressure dolorimeter was used to evaluate pain threshold at the Yangxi (L.I. 5) and Quchi (L.I. 11) points and at sites 15 mm from them. The effects on pain threshold were also measured at Yingxiang (L.I. 20) on both sides.Before electrostimulation there were no significant differences among the pain thresholds in both AP and NAP. After electrostimulation of the Yangxi point, pain threshold raised from 5.20 kg/sq.cm to 9.20 kg/sq.cm (p < 0.01); acupuncture at Quchi caused the threshold to increase from 5.36 kg/sq.cm to 9.20 kg/sq.cm (p < 0.01) and Yingxiang stimulation changed threshold from 2.63 kg/sq.cm to 3.83 kg/sq.cm (p < 0.051) at the point on the same side and from 2.26 kg/sq.cm to 3.90 kg/sq.cm (p < 0.05) in the opposite side. Before electroacupuncture the pain thresholds at all the tested sites were not statistically different (p > 0.1).

The dye Evans Blue (EB) was used as a tracer for assessing the disruption of BBB. Fluorescence quantification of EB was performed to explore the temporal pattern of permeability of BBB after the cerebral I-R with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HITACHI 650-60). Furthermore, the morphology of BBB opening was detected under confocal laser scanning microscopy system. It was found that the BBB opening after cerebral I-R was biphasic. A rare scattered extravasation of EB was detected 2 hours after cerebral I-R. The EB extravasation reached its first peak at 6 h then decreased at 24 h and increased again at the time-point of 48h after cerebral I-R. EA can attenuate the disruption of BBB after cerebral I-R. EA could not only limit the area of extravasation of EB, but also reduce the concentration of extravasation of EB in the rat brain after cerebral I-R. The results indicated that one of the mechanisms of curative effect of EA on the cerebral ischemia might be due to its function of protecting the integrity of BBB.",

It was found that an extremely strong magnetic field was emitted from the two individuals. One subject emitted a magnetic field at the level of 200-300 mT (2-3 mGauss) and the other at 0.13 mT (1.3 mGauss). In both cases, moreover, the magnetic needle compass rotated 30 degrees (this was tested 32 times).

Therefore, it is considered that DPA administered as an inhibiting drug of this degrading enzyme might prolong analgesia induced by acupuncture. 1) Thirty patients suffering from chronic low back pain were treated with acupuncture 30 minutes after the oral administration of 4.0 grams of DPA. The results were: excellent in 7 cases, good in 11, fair in 6 and poor in 6. Cases graded excellent and good were then compared with a placebo group. The effect was increased 26% in the DPA-acupuncture group, which shows no statistically significant difference (P less than 0.1). 2) In 56 patients, tooth extraction was performed under acupuncture anesthesia: 18 had received 4.0 gram of DPA (P.O.) 30 minutes earlier. The results were excellent in 8, good in 6, fair in 3, and poor in 1. The excellent and good cases were compared with 38 placebo group cases. The effect in the DPA-acupuncture anesthesia group was significantly increased by 35% (P less than 0.01). 3) In order to determine the optimum time for the administration of DPA, two schedules of administration were compared. [1] DPA was given on the previous day in three 0.5 gram doses (26 cases). [2] A single 4 gram dose was administered 30 minutes before treatment (30 cases). The results from the \"excellent\", \"good\" and \"fair\" cases showed a 16% increase in effectiveness when DPA was administered the day before, not a statistically significant difference (P less than 0.1), but a clear tendency to increase was observed. The above findings show that DPA has an enhancing effect on acupuncture analgesia and anesthesia in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "This study was to examine the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation on neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in the brainstem nuclei in rats. Low-frequency EA stimulation (3 pulses/sec) was applied between 2 acupuncture points (acupoints), Jinggu (BL 64) and Shugu (BL 65) which are cutaneously located at hindlimb, in rats anesthetized with ketamine. After 2 hours stimulation and sham-treatment, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Sections of rat medulla were examined by immunolabeling with a polyclonal antibody directed against nNOS. The brainstem nuclei were also visualized by NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry, a marker of nNOS activity. nNOS levels were quantified by using a microscope with reticule grid to count the number of positive cells over an area. Unilateral EA stimulation of BL 64 and BL 65 in rats caused increases in nNOS immunostaining cells in the ipsilateral and contralateral gracile nucleus compared with sham-treated rats (P<0.05, n=6). NADPH-diaphorase positive cells were also increased in the gracile nucleus of the rats with EA stimulation. Neither nNOS immunostaining nor NADPH-diaphorase reactivity was altered in the nucleus tractus solitarius, rostral ventral medull and other brainstem nuclei in rats with EA stimulation. These results show that nNOS immunoreactivity and NADPH-diaphorase reactivity are consistently increased in the gracile nucleus by low-frequency EA applied to BL 64 and BL 65. We conclude that EA stimulation of the cutaneous hindlimb acupoints induces nNOS expression in the gracile nucleus, and enhanced nNOS-NO in the area may mediate somatosympathetic reflex activities, which contribute to therapeutic effects of acupuncture.",

The results indicate that after 2 h MCAO, GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity profoundly increased in peri-infarct cerebral cortex, with peaks at 2 h after reperfusion, then declined dramatically at 12 and 24 h after reperfusion. Although EA given immediatelly after MCAO couldn't elevate the peaks of GDNF expression, it obviously raised the GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity levels at 12 h after reperfusion, delayed the declining trends of GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity levels. These results suggest that EA could upregulate GDNF expression after ischemic insult, elongating the duration of upregulated GDNF expression. This may be one of the mechanisms of EA anti-ischemic injury by augmenting endogenous protective mechanism.",

The detection of biophoton was done with two photomultiplier tubes whose spectral range was from 300 nm to 650 nm. The measurement was done on a circular area of diameter 46 mm whose centers were at the acupuncture point Laogong (PC8) of a palm and the mid-point of a back, respectively. The emission rates from the dorsa showed strong seasonal dependence which is consistent with the active nature of Yang meridians, while the palm sides show less seasonal dependence as they belong to the passive Yin meridians. This could be quantified simply by the standard deviations from the yearly average: They were 47.6 counts per second (cps), 66.1 cps and 66.0 cps from the dorsa, and 23.8 cps, 29.7 cps and 30.4 cps from the palms of subject 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Biophoton emission revealed qualitative individual tendencies: The subjects 1 and 2 emitted more strongly from the left dorsa, while the subject 3 from the right dorsum. The left-right balance of biophoton emission was well kept for normal people, which is in contrast with the severe imbalance for some stroke patients. Thus biophoton measurement has a diagnostic potential that encourages more studies.",

The acupuncture points GB-34 and SP-9 were needled and stimulated manually. Normalised H-reflex and M-wave recruitment curves were constructed and the ratio of the slope of the ascending part of the H-reflex recruitment curve (Hslp) to the slope of the ascending part of the M-wave recruitment curve (Mslp) was used for assessing changes in alpha-motoneuron excitability. Sustained manual acupuncture caused significant reduction of alpha-motoneuron excitability, while short duration manual acupuncture had no effect. The reduction of alpha-motoneuron excitability following sustained manual acupuncture occurred fifteen minutes after cessation of acupuncture and was still present at 30 minutes. The relationship between perceived intensity of acupuncture sensation (Deqi) and changes in alpha-motoneuron excitability was also studied, but no significant correlation was found. This study indicates that manual acupuncture would be useful in clinical conditions associated with increased alpha-motoneuron excitability and that when using acupuncture for these conditions, higher intensity of perceived acupuncture sensation (Deqi) may not result in greater degree of reduction in alpha-motoneuron excitability.",

A focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined were affected after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Major altered genes were downregulated. In EA-treated monkeys, approximately 10% of the total number of genes examined were affected. Major altered genes were upregulated, including signal transduction-, cell-cycle-, metabolism-, stress response-, DNA repair-related genes. One of the representative upregulated genes encodes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was confirmed using in situ hybridization. Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture. In conclusion, the protective mechanisms of EA against stroke include several related pathways and gene expressions. Microarray analysis may provide a framework for understanding these complicated mechanisms and yield valuable, clinically relevant insights and potentially therapeutic targets of stroke.",

We prepared the epilepsy rats by intrahippocampal injection of penicillin. One hour later the lower 1/2 auricular lobules of seizure rats, containing ear-points Pizhixia and Shenmen etc., was electrically stimulated, which was imitated as ear-point electrical acupuncture in humans.

When these rats were subsequently given the ear-point electrical stimulation, the convulsion behaviors were definitely improved.

    "abstract": "If acupuncture is able to prevent hypertrophy of the heart, it could therefore prevent the heart from overloading and thus prevent heart failure or sudden death. We therefore studied the effects of acupuncture on blood pressure and cardiac muscle cells. Rats with spontaneous hypertension were divided into three acupuncture treatment groups and one non-treatment group. The treatment groups were classified as sham acupoint, Yanglingquan (GB. 34) and Quchi (LI. 11) groups. The measurements recorded included changes in tail pressure, femoral arterial pressure, left ventricular weight (LVW), whole heart weight (WHW), body weight (BW), LVW/BW and WHW/BW ratios and the size of the cardiac muscle cells. The results showed that femoral arterial pressure of subjects which were needled on the selected points for 3 days dropped. Acupuncture at these two acupoints seemed to improve the condition of hypertension in a short period of time. Significant changes in the femoral arterial pressure were observed in all subjects when they were treated for 6 days. In the two acupoint groups, the LVW/BW and the WHW/BW ratios did not change significantly. Cardiac muscle cells reduced in size in the Yanglingquan (GB. 34) treatment groups. This indicates that the Yanglingquan (GB. 34) points not only can lower blood pressure, but also prevent hypertrophy of cardiac muscle cells in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). Therefore, acupuncture could be a good treatment modality for hypertension and hypertrophy of the heart.",

Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-amino-acid peptide, is known to increase appetite. In the present study, the effect of acupuncture stimulation at Zusanli (St.36) on NPY expression in the Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was investigated via immunohistochemistry. Increased NPY expression was detected in both the Arcuate nucleus (ARN) and the Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the Hypothalamus in rats with in STZ-induced diabetes. Needling on Zusanli resulted in decreased NPY levels in both the ARN and PVN of diabetic rats. The present study shows that acupuncture suppressed NPY expression in the ARN and PVN of the Hypothalamus in STZ-induced diabetic rats, suggesting the possibility that acupuncture treatment is effective in curbing the hyperphagia of diabetes.",

The model of epilepsy was by injecting penicillin into the hippocampus. One hour later, the lower 1/2 auricular lobules containing ear-points Pizhixia, Shenmen_Zeng and Nao, etc. as humans, or great auricular nerve of seizure rats, were treated twice with electrical stimulation (parameters of stimulation were as follows: electrical current intensity 0.14 approximately 0.2 mA, frequency about 80Hz, 30 min on and 30 min off). The outcome showed that rats appeared epileptic-like electrocorticogram and convulsion behaviors 5 min after injected penicillin. When they were subsequently given the ear-point or great auricular nerve electrical stimulation separately, these epileptic-like electrocorticogram and seizure behaviors were definitely improved. These anti-seizure effects could be enhanced with hour extension of electrical stimulation. If the great auricular nerve of seizure rat was severed before electrical stimulating ear-points, the effects of anti-seizure disappeared. Otherwise, the seizure rats given sham ear-point electrical stimulation (the experimental conditions were same as that of ear-point stimulation other than electric current being no applied) did not show any improvement for epileptic-like electrocorticogram and seizure behaviors. Based on the results above, it was suggested that ear-point electrical stimulation could cause certainly efficacy of anti-seizure, which may be relative with the great auricular nerve.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is one of the leading chronic diseases of our times, with millions of sufferers worldwide and can be defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is temporarily reversible either spontaneously or by treatment. Although there are many allopathic treatments including bronchodilators and corticosteroids, which either focuses on long-term control or immediate relief, there is no single medication that is effective against both the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictive components of asthma. Therefore, many sufferers turn to alternative or complementary therapies, typically in conjunction with their regular allopathic medications. The current short communication briefly reviews the disease and investigates the types of alternative and complementary treatments available to asthma sufferers. It is concluded that therapies like acupuncture, yoga, Tai Chi Chuan and hypnosis are used by many asthma patients but it seems as if many patients do not communicate the use of such therapies to their medical practitioners. Results from documented research, however, show alternative therapies for the treatment of asthma have a role to play and are effective to alleviate symptoms. However, well-organized clinical trials are needed to document efficacy and delineate the specific types of interventions most appropriate for particular asthmatic populations.",

    "abstract": "The Purpose of this study was to investigate the possible needling effect on sympathetic activity by using functional MRI (fMRI). Twelve patients with left lower extremity pain were enrolled in our study. Each was given deep needling at left GB34 (yanglingquan) and GB39 (xuanzhong) points simultaneously. All patients got the strong DeQi sensation by manipulating the needles, and then electroacupucture (EA) was given and lasted for thirty minutes before fMRI scan. Then the fMRI scan was performed by scanning the whole brain with five blocks lasting 2 minutes each. The patients' palm skin temperatures were tested every five minutes as indication of the sympathetic activity from the beginning of EA to the end of our fMRI scan. Functional images were processed by using FEAT software at different levels including the simple single subject analysis, multi-subjects group mean analysis, and multi-subjects unpaired two difference analysis. Finally, 9 of 12 patients' palm temperatures increased gradually but the other three decreased. In comparison of two different palm skin temperature change groups, more significant activation over bilateral caudate head, right lentiform and periaqueductal gray (PAG) were found in the temperature-increased group, but palm temperature-decreased patients revealed more significant activation over bilateral anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), insula, primary somatosensory gyrus (SI), orbitofrontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala formation. Our study suggested that needling at analgesic points may modulate the sympathetic activity and such evident difference on brain responses may correlate with the clinical analgesia effects.",

    "abstract": "It is known that acupuncture, a Chinese old medical science, is often very effective in pain relief processes in several parts of the human body, particularly in the treatment of tooth and lower back pain. The origin for the pain relief is generally attributed to the release of some proteins in the brain, like beta endorphin (neurotransmitters) which are known to have an analgesic effect. In this paper we suggest an additional and significant neural process which provides relief from pains due to the suppression of the action potential by the insertion of acupuncture metal needles that attract the excess of Na+ and hence the process reduces the intensity of the action potential. Successive steps of reduction with a set of needles inserted at selected points reduce the intensity of the action potential below the threshold value. This simple, but noteworthy process has far reaching consequences in acupuncture science as it might provide, for the first time, a solid foundation for a well established technique.",

Patients with a distal radius fracture treated with closed reduction, percutaneous pinning, and a short cast for six weeks was included and were assigned to one of two study groups. The control group was given simulated laser acupuncture with the laser off, while the experimental group received laser beam on acupuncture points. A low power infrared 980 nm, 50 mW laser (Diller &amp; Diller Laser Performance) electric energy, was used; each acupuncture point was irradiated for 30 seconds at 8,000 Hz at each therapy session. In both groups, treatment was applied to the following points: Ipsilateral- Yanggu (SI5), Yangchi (SJ4), Waiguan (SJ15), Yangxi (LI5), Daling (PC7); Bilateral- Hegu (LI4); Contralateral- Shenmail (VL62), Kulun (V60), Taixi (KID3).

They were evaluated using the VAS, the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), and wrist mobility ranges at the beginning of treatment, at the end of the fifth session, at the 10th session, and a week after the 10th session. The patients treated with laser beam exposure on acupuncture points showed 44% reduction in pain and 33% of improvement in the functional status of the wrist compared with the control group. Application of laser beam on acupuncture points combined with active rehabilitation exercises show benefits in the rehabilitation of patients with a distal radius fracture managed with percutaneous pinning and a short cast.",

Authors have reported that these interventions can reduce the pain and increase the muscle strength in various clinical situations. Materials and Methods: The level of pain was evaluated by the visual analogue scale and the range of movement of the knees by goniometry. In five weeks protocols, in the AT intervention, ear points (Shenmen, Kidney, corresponding point-Knee) were stimulated by two seeds ( Semen vaccariae ), approximated diameter of 1 mm that were previously in an adhesive tape and they were changed every week. The control group had no seeds in the ear's lobe adhesive tape. All the participants were instructed to use the fingers to press (manually) the adhesive tapes for 10 min, three times per day (six days) and to remove the tapes (7th day) before returning to the laboratory. In WBMV intervention, the biomechanical parameters of the mechanical vibration were (i) peak-to-peak displacement ( D ) with 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mm and (ii) frequency ranging from 5 Hz on the first day, increasing by 1 Hz per session, ending with 14 Hz in the last session. The working time was 3 min with 1 min of rest. The evaluations were performed (i) before and after the first session (acute effect) and (ii) before the first (5 Hz) and after the last (14 Hz) session (cumulative effect). Results: A significant ( p &lt;0.05) decrease of the level of pain in the participants with knee osteoarthritis treated with WBMV exercise and with the combined intervention (WBMV and AT) was found in the acute and cumulative effects. The pain was importantly reduced due to WBMV exercise alone about 50% and reduced about 16% in the combination with AT, in the acute intervention. In the cumulative intervention, the pain was strongly reduced about 60% due to WBMV exercise alone and about 37% in the combination with AT. Possibility, this decrease in the effect may be related to inhibitory/competitive actions of the two interventions. In the control groups, no alteration on the level of the pain was observed. The range of the movement (knee´s flexion) was not altered in the participants of the all groups. Conclusion: It is possible to conclude that the level of the pain was decreased (acute and cumulative effects), with both interventions, WBMV exercise alone or combined with AT, However, more studies are need to widespread the use of these forms of treatment.",

EA frequency was held constant at 2Hz (2 pulses/second), pulse width 0.3-ms, and intensity was adjusted to 3 mA. Forced swim tests (FST), open field tests (OFT; e.g., a. rearing and grooming, b. distance traveled within a central area, c. time spent in central area, and d. total distance traveled), and the Morris Water Maze test (MWM) were conducted 3 weeks after the initial treatment.In the FST, there was significant difference between EA and control (P < 0.05) in immobility. In the OFT, there were significant differences between EA and control (P < 0.05) in rearing and grooming (P < 0.05). In the MWM, there were significant differences between treatment and control in frequency of crossing the platform (P < 0.05) and its surrounding area (P < 0.05).Our data demonstrate that EA enhances memory and improves depression-related behaviors in a rat model of depression.

Kv1.4 is the main component of the slow Ito (Ito. s) channel. Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are the main components of the fast Ito (Ito. f) channel. KChIP2 is a compound protein of Ito channel. In this experiment, MI was induced by injecting isoproterenol in rats, and the gene and protein expressions of Kv1.4, Kv4.2, Kv4.3 and KChIP2 were lower [The gene and protein decreased (42.8±4.3)% and (37.2±4.7)% respectively.] than the control rats significantly (p &lt; 0.05). After MI induction, the MI rats were divided into three groups, including PC6, LU7 (Lieque-point) and Non-acupoint group which were acupunctured at once a day for 7 days respectively. After EA at PC6 and LU7, the gene and protein expressions showed obvious increased [EA at PC6: the gene and protein increased (50.2±5.4)% and (39.1±5.3)% respectively. EA at LU7: the gene and protein increased (24.6±2.8)% and (22.0±5.5)% respectively] and they are all higher than MI rats significantly (p &lt; 0.05). EA at PC6 and LU7 showed the same variation, and the effects of EA at PC6 and LU7 were better than Non-acupuncture-point (p &lt; 0.05).

PC6 is an acupoint of the pericardium meridian, and the pericardium meridian which corresponds to adrenal gland according to Omura Y's research, can affect the heart function directly. LU7 belong to the lung meridian, and the lung plays an important factor in blood circulation according to TCM. So PC6 is more effective than LU7 on heart function regulation. The results suggested that PC6 showed the target effect of meridian specificity on regulating the Kv channel in MI.",

However, the number of needles used, i.e. the “dose” of acupuncture stimulation, to obtain the best antinociceptive efficacy, is still a matter of debate. The question was addressed comparing the clinical efficacy of 3 different therapeutic schemes, mainly characterized by different numbers of needles used on 90 patients affected by a painful cervical myofascial syndrome. Patients were divided into 3 groups; the first group of 30 patients was treated with 11 needles, the second group of 30 patients was treated with 5 needles and the third group of 30 patients was treated with 3 needles. Each group underwent eight cycles of somatic acupuncture. In each session and in each group, all needles were stimulated until the pain tolerance threshold was reached;\"pain tolerance is the amount of pain a person can handle without breaking down, either physically or emotionally\". Pain intensity was evaluated before therapy, immediately after, and at 1 and 3 months follow-up by means of both the Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Pain and the repercussion of pain on the patient's quality of life (DOPE- Descriptors Of Pain Effects) were also measured using a test we developed, administered at each session. In all groups, needles were inserted superficially, except for the two most painful trigger points that were deeply inserted. All groups, independently from the number of needles used, obtained a good and significant therapeutic effect without clinically relevant differences among groups. For this pathology and patients of this kind, the number of needles, 3 or 5 or 11, seems not to be an important variable in determining the therapeutic effect.",

    "abstract": "Objective: It was postulated in our previous publications that the meridian channels as conceived in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are various standing waves arising from harmonic rhythmic sound frequencies originating from the human heart beat. BIOCERAMIC is an artificial material able to produce a weak force field causing different biophysical and systemic health benefits, with the key characteristics of hydrogen bonds weakening and microcirculation enhancement. Since discovering that the effects of a BIOCERAMIC field can be transmitted via sound waves propagation, we then also developed a BIOCERAMIC Resonance device to produce weak force field throughout the body, and achieve resonance with the body's meridian channels to reinforce microcirculation. Methods: Since our previous research proved BIOCERAMIC can produces changes in ectodermal current levels, the present evaluation on reflexology is done by the application of Electric Current Detection (ECD) to the palmar surface of the hands matching correlative organs and glands loci to reflex points according to standard reflexology. The procedure will compare changes in the electrical current observed before and after a session of BIOCERAMIC Resonance treatment on the soles of the subjects' feet. We also conducted a procedure using corona discharge (Kirlian) photography of the hands to examine whether the coronal intensities could be affected by application of the BIOCERAMIC patch. Intensities are shown on the screen of a computer using special software that categorizes intensities into five zones. Results: Under the continuous treatment of BIOCERAMIC Resonance on soles of the feet and simultaneous stimulation on the specific point on the surface of the ear representing the urinary bladder. The electrical current (Δμ ampere) on the areas in the hands are decreased from the beginning of the experiment, but only the specific area on the surface of the ear representing the urinary bladder was exhibited increased of the electrical current (Δμ ampere), with statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05). To the other study we evaluated the validity of reflexology and corona discharge (Kirlian) photography by applying BIOCERAMIC Resonance and small adhesive patches made from the BIOCERAMIC material. Significant differences were evident on four out of five different zones of the computerized images. Conclusion: Our findings suggest the existence of presupposed virtual channels or reflex points on the skin surface of the feet, hands, and ears that connect or somehow reflect back to specific internal organs, as mapped out on standard charts found in reflexology. Furthermore, the depicted corona intensities from five zones shown on a computer screen of corona discharge photography seem to indicate that the volunteer subjects are affected by the BIOCERAMIC patches. This study demonstrates the operation of the BIOCERAMIC Resonance device is able to produce weak force field through the body, which is objectively measurable and thereby scientifically integrating the concepts of reflexology, meridian channels and biofield therapy.",

    "abstract": "During the past 10 years, the author had found that the optimal dose of Vitamin D3 400 I.U. has safe & effective anticancer effects, while commonly used 2000-5000 I.U. of Vit. D3 often creates a 2-3 time increase in cancer markers. We examined the concentration of Taurine in normal internal organs and in cancer using Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. We found that Taurine levels in normal tissue are 4-6ng. But, the amount of Taurine of average normal value of 5.0-5.25ng was strikingly reduced to 0.0025-0.0028ng in this study of several examples in adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, prostate, and lung, as well as breast cancer. The lowest Taurine levels of 0.0002-0.0005ng were found in so called Zika virus infected babies from Brazil with microcephaly. While Vitamin D3 receptor stimulant 1α, 25 (OH)2D3 in normal tissues was 0.45-0.53ng, they were reduced to 0.025-0.006ng in cancers (1/100th-1/200th of normal value), particularly in various adenocarcinomas. All of these adenocarcinomas had about 1500ng HPV-16 viral infection. In 500 breast cancers, about 97% had HPV-16. The optimal dose of Taurine for average adult has been found to be about 175mg, rather than the widely used 500mg. In addition, since Taurine is markedly reduced to close to 1/1000th-1/2000th of its normal value in these cancer tissues, we examined the effect of the optimal dose of Taurine on cancer patients. Optimal dose of Taurine produced a very significant decrease in cancer-associated parameters, such as Oncogene C-fosAb2 & Integrin α5β1 being reduced to less than 1/1,000th, and 8-OH-dG (which increases in the presence of DNA mutation) reduced to less than 1/10th. The optimal dose of Taurine 175mg for average adult various cancer patient 3 times a day alone provide beneficial effects with very significant anti-cancer effects with strikingly increased urinary excretion of bacteria, viruses, & funguses, asbestos, toxic metals & other toxic substances. However, optimal doses of Taurine combined with optimal individualized doses of ψ3 fish oil [EPA 180mg & DHA 120mg] & special cilantro tablet 3 times/day without creating harmful drug interactions among them including other essential drugs, is often extremely safe, more effective, economical & non-invasive new treatment for various cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Electroacupuncture According to Voll (EAV) was used to monitor the effects of qigong practice on therapeutic balancing of subjects. In EAV the electrical conductance of the skin above individual acupuncture points is measured using low voltage and current. Diagnosis depends on measuring the relative electrical conductance and its time dependence. An important diagnostic criterion of degeneration of an organ is an indicator drop which occurs during the measurement when the conductance decreases from an apparent maximum value and then levels off. Two series of EAV measurements were made before and after healthy subjects practiced qigong. Measurements were made at 24 acupuncture points at the ends of the meridians of the fingers and toes of a subject and were made by the same operator and equipment. The subjects were asked to perform a qigong exercise of their choosing. In the first series, four subjects were examined by EAV before and after qigong exercise. Qigong exercise decreased the average EAV measured values of the four subjects in the range of -19 to -31%. Qigong eliminated indicator drops for three subjects and reduced the indicator drop by 80% for the fourth subject. In the second series, each of seven subjects was examined by EAV three times in a blind protocol so that the operator did not know whether a subject had practiced qigong before the second or third examination. Qigong exercise changed the average EAV measured values in the range of -17 to -35% for four subjects and 4 to 15% for three subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

TENS was applied either over the median nerve or to the Hegyu acupuncture point (L.I.4) for 15 minutes. Blood flow and skin temperature data were recorded during TENS and for 15 minutes post TENS. Analysis of results showed significant differences between groups for cutaneous blood flow (p=0.0001; repeated measures ANOVA). There was a significant increase in blood flow in the TENS median nerve group compared with the other two groups during TENS application. No significant changes in skin temperature were observed between groups. This study demonstrates that the effect of TENS upon cutaneous blood flow is dependent upon electrode placement sites.",

The study design was a comparison test. The study was accomplished in a referral on outpatient clinic. Participants were 9 urinary incontinent patients sent to physiotherapist for pelvic floor muscle exercise and 2 asymptomatic volunteers. The participants were asked to do pelvic floor contractions in supine position. The EMG activity of pelvic floor muscles was measured with four different types of intravaginal probes, and rectal pressure was measured simultaneously with a microtip catheter for controlling the pelvic floor muscle contraction force levels. Main outcome measure was the electrical activity of pelvic floor muscle contractions. The intraprobe correlation coefficients for comparing subsequent measurements ranged from 0.84-0.97, indicating adequate reliability. The results were affected by the location of the measuring electrodes, and the shape and size of the probes. No statistically significant differences were found between different probes. The compliance was best with L- shaped probe B and it gave highest mean EMG values so it was chosen for M- further development as a biofeedback-based home training system.",

The Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (B.D.O.R.T.) of Yoshiaki Omura, M.D.,Sc.D. was used to determine the \"True ST.36\". Young soccer players (N = 24) between 16-18 years of age (Mean = 16.92 +/- 0.65) were involved in the study. The extension & flexion strengths of dominant legs were measured with Cybex 350 Extremity System isokinetically. The testing velocity was 60 degrees/sec. The peak torque value in Newton meters (Nm) was evaluated. Subjects were tested 3 times. Extension & Flexion 1 (EXT1, FLEX1) without acupuncture application, EXT2 & FLEX2 after application on the traditional acupuncture point, ST.36 and EXT3 & FLEX3 after application onto the 'Omura's New Foot-point' (\"True ST.36\"). Before each test, subjects warmed up for 10 minutes by cycling on an isokinetic ergometer at 50 RPM, 75 Watts load followed by stretching exercises of lower extremity. Mean EXT1, EXT2, EXT3 values were 196.92 +/- 28.70: 210.00 +/- 23.00; 224.42 +/- 21.70 respectively, where FLEX1, FLEX2, FLEX3 were 140.88 +/- 22.45; 151.13 +/- 21.27; 161.00 +/- 22.23. Comparisons of EXT1-EXT2, EXT1-EXT3, EXT2-EXT3, FLEX1-FLEX2, FLEX1-FLEX3, FLEX2-FLEX3 strength values showed all very high significance (P < 0.001) in favor of 1) Needling on relevant points and 2) Omura's ST.36 Point (\"True ST.36\"). We conclude that B.D.O.R.T. can help to determine new (True) Acupuncture points and, both points were effective for increasing the isokinetic knee extension & flexion strength of young soccer players very significantly where as Omura's ST.36 Point (\"True ST.36\") was more effective than Traditional Acupuncture point, ST.36.",

    "abstract": "Using Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Resonance Phenomena between 2 identical substances, Omura, Y. succeeded in making the image of the outline of internal organs without use of standard imaging devices since 1982. When he imaged the outline of the stomach on the abdominal wall, a number of the lines came out from upper and lower parts of stomach wall. When the lines were followed, they were very close to the well-known stomach meridians. Subsequently, he found a method of localizing meridians and their corresponding acupuncture points as well as shapes and diameters accurately. At the anatomical location of ST 36 described in traditional textbooks, Omura, Y. found there is no acupuncture point. However, in the close vicinity, there is an acupuncture point which he named as true ST 36 in the mid 1980s, but it is generally known as Omura's ST 36. When the effects of the acupuncture on these 2 locations were compared, Omura's ST 36 (true ST 36) produced very significant well-known acupuncture beneficial effects including improved circulation and blood chemistry, while in the traditional ST 36, the effects were small. In this article, the anatomical relationship between these two acupuncture points, with a short distance of 0.6 approximately 1.5 cm between the centers of these locations, was described. In early 2000, Omura, Y. found Press Needle Stimulation of Omura's ST 36, using \"Press-Release\" procedure repeated 200 times, 4 times a day to cancer patients reduced high cancer cell telomere of 600-1500ng and high Oncogen C-fos Ab2 and Integrin alpha5beta1 of 100-700ng BDORT units to close to lyg (= 10(-24) g) BDORT units. In addition there was a significant reduction of Asbestos and Hg from cancer cells, while markedly reduced normal cell telomere of lyg was increased to optimally high amounts of 500-530ng BDORTunits. Thus, cancer cells can no longer divide and cancer activity is inhibited. The authors have successfully applied this method for a variety of cancers as well as for cardio-vascular diseases with hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, high L-homocystein, and CRP, high cardiac Troponim I & T, and some hypertension. These beneficial effects were accompanied by euphoria, & relaxation with increased alpha waves in EEG. Thus Omura's ST 36 stimulation is a safe, effective and highly desirable supplemental treatment. In addition to manual stimulation, similar beneficial effects can be induced by finger tip stmulation (without any needle) or with electroacupuncture stimulation, (+) Qi Gong energy stored paper and (+) solar energy stored paper which often resulted in significant clinical improvement.",

A total of 200 subjects (100 males and 100 females, 18-40 years of age) were recruited from the general population. According to ancient TCM records, the \"6% of the elbow length\" (ELx6%) is used as the standard method of establishing the length of Cun. We hypothesized that the highest point of \"prominent bone\" (PB) is the lower limit of Cun, so \"the distance between the distal wrist crease and the highest point of the PB\" (DWP) is considered the length of Cun. If this hypothesis holds, then we can define the locations of Cun, Guan and Chi by using the ratio 6:6:7 from the ancient TCM records. The distribution of relative bias and paired t-test were used to verify the findings. The mean value of relative bias of DWP compared with ELx6% was close to 0% (males = 2.1%, SD = 12.2%; females = 0.2%, SD = 12.6%). The paired t-test confirmed that there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the mean values of the DWP and ELx6%. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the length of the Cun is equal to the length of the DWP. Our findings confirm that the location of Cun is from the distal wrist crease to the highest point of PB.",

Forty-four patients between the ages of 22 and 56 were randomly assigned to an acupuncture (n = 23) and a medication group (n = 21). The acupuncture group received abdominal acupuncture once a day for the first three days and once every three days for the remaining 11 days. In addition, every subject in acupuncture group also received a placebo pill once daily. Abdominal acupuncture was administered according to a standardized protocol involving four master and four adjunctive acupoints: Zhongwan (CV 12), Xiawan (CV 10), Guanyuan (CV 4), and Qihai (CV 6); bilateral Shangqu (KI 17), Huaroumen (ST 24), Xiafengshidian, and Qipang. Subjects in the medication group were treated with sham acupuncture at the same time as the acupuncture group and received estazolam once a day. The outcome measure was the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), administered before and after the trial. Subjects who received abdominal acupuncture lowered their LSEQ scores by an average of 26.32 points (95% CI: 37.34, 15.30). After controlling for potential confounding factors, the effect of abdominal acupuncture in relieving insomnia was still statistically significant. Results indicate that short-term abdominal acupuncture is more effective than pharmacological treatment for relieving insomnia in adult women and has few adverse effects.",

Since 1995, we have been using press-needle stimulation of Omura's ST36 with 200x press-release procedure 4x a day, with significant improvements in various cancer patients. In this study, Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation (TES) at 60 pulses/min, which is close to patient's heart rate, was given between Omura's ST36 of both legs of the breast cancer &amp; Alzheimer's patients. After about 10 minutes of TES, NC telomeres increased from 1yg (=10 –24 g) to 500–525ng; Integ. reduced from 85–75ng to 0.5ng &amp; Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) reduced from 4500–3500ng to 0.5ng. An additional 10 minutes TES increased NC telomeres to 800-875ng, while Integ. reduced to 0.5yg &amp; CT became less than 0.1yg. After a total 30 minutes of TES, NC telomeres increased to 1000—1200ng BDORT units, with decreases in Integ. and Onco. to less than 0.1yg. CT reduced to &lt;&lt;0.1yg. About 24 hours later, NC telomeres were still 300ng &amp; both Integ. and Onco. were 2.5ng. CT was –20ng. In Alzheimer patient, abnormally high β-Amyloid (1—42) of 7—12ng markedly reduced to within normal value of less than 1.5ng by 20–30 min TES. Stimulation beyond 30 minutes gradually reduced NC telomeres. TES pulse rate of 4 pulses/sec for the same patient initially increased NC telomere up to 750—950ng BDORT units within 20 minutes, but when stimulation continued more than 20 min, NC telomeres rapidly reduced to –150ng in less than 10 min of TES with reduced beneficial effects.",

    "abstract": "Contra-lateral Needling, a traditional acupuncture technique, means contra-lateral acupuncture by inserting needles into acupoints on the relative healthy side of the body opposite to the injured side to treat diseases such as apoplexy with high efficacy. However, there are not many well-designed and controlled clinical evidences found in the literature. Therefore the present study was designed to assess its therapeutic responses in the treatment of hemiplegia due to acute ischemic stroke. A clinical study was conducted with randomly selected 106 patients who have acute ischemic stroke confirmed by MRI. The subjects were assigned into 3 groups: 45 in the contra-lateral needling group received acupuncture on the unaffected limbs; 45 in the conventional acupuncture group received acupuncture on the hemiplegic limbs; and 16 in the non-acupuncture group received the similar medical and nursing care as subjects in other two groups but no acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture was given daily for 45 minutes for 30 days. The clinical therapeutic responses rate, Neurological Deficits Score (NDS), Modified Barthel Index (MBI) and Fugl-Meger Assertion (FMA) were used to evaluate the effectiveness ono days treatment. The therapeutic response rate of the contra-lateral needling group was 46.67%, while 31.11% in the conventional acupuncture group, and 18.75% in the non-acupuncture group. The NDS of Contra-lateral needling group decreased more significantly than that of the conventional acupuncture group (p&lt;0.01). The study also found that the MBI and FMA of Contra-lateral needling group increased more significantly than those of the conventional acupuncture group (p&lt;O. OI, respectively). Contra-lateral needling might be more effective than the conventional acupuncture in the treatment of hemiplegia due to acute ischemic stroke in terms of increasing the recovery of neurological functions, promoting ADL (activities for daily living) rehabilitation and the limbs motor function.",

The electrophysiological signals of acupoints and control groups were recorded simultaneously. The results show that acupoint electrophysiological signals have higher Power Spectral Density and power than nearby non-acupoint areas. Integrating the entire data, power of acupoint electrical signals are about 14.7% higher than nearby non-acupoint electrical signals, and most of the higher power is distributed from 0 to 10 Hz and 0-2 Hz is the highest. The maximum power difference between acupoints and non-acupoint is 61.5% appeared in LI 11. From physiological view, the percentage is high enough to show the electrical specificity of acupoint, which is strong proof of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory and one of the bases for further research. As acupoint electrophysiological signals are driven by internal organs, they can reflect the health condition of internal organs effectively, and so analysis of acupoint electrophysiological signals may be a new way to diagnose organ diseases instead of with the experience of doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine.",

In present paper, influence of intracerebroventricular(ICV) administration of OFQ or electroacupuncture(EA) on the surgical trauma-induced inhibition of the splenic natural killer(NK) cell activity in rat was observed. The results showed that administration of 0.1 microgram(0.0055 nmol) and 1 microgram (0.055 nmol) OFQ had no effect on the NK cell activity, while 5 micrograms(2.75 nmol) OFQ reduced the NK cell activity in normal rats. However, 0.1 microgram, 1 microgram or 5 micrograms OFQ were found to antagonise the immune function depression caused by surgical trauma. The NK cell activity was reduced in normal rats after repeated ICV treatment with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) complementary to bases of translated region of rat OFQ receptor mRNA to block the translation of OFQ receptor mRNA into protein. EA stimulation of Zusanli(St. 36) and Lanwei(Extra. 37) points also obviously improved the immunosuppression produced by trauma. OFQ combined with EA showed antagonism on the suppression, but there was no significant differences compared with OFQ(ICV) or EA alone. When blocking the translation of OFQ receptor mRNA with the ASO, the OFQ induced anti-immunosuppression effect was completely reversed, but EA still improved the inhibition on NK cell activity. The results suggested that the OFQ played a role in the regulation of immunosuppression. EA could modulate the suppression of NK cell activity induced by surgical trauma. The mechanisms of the modulation of OFQ or EA on the immunosuppression induced by surgical trauma need further study.",

    "abstract": "Because of the reduced effectiveness of antibiotics against bacteria (e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis, alpha-Streptococcus, Borrelia burgdorferi, etc.) and viruses (e.g. Herpes Family Viruses) in the presence of mercury, as well as the fact that the 1st author has found that mercury exists in cancer and pre-cancer cell nuclei, the presence of dental amalgam (which contains about 50% mercury) in the human mouth is considered to be a potential hazard for the individual's health. In order to solve this problem, 3 amalgam fillings were removed from the teeth of the subject of this case study. In order to fill the newly created empty spaces in the teeth where the amalgams had formerly existed, a synthetic dental-filling substance was introduced and to solidify the synthetic substance, curing light (wavelength range reportedly between 400-520 nm) was radiated onto the substance in order to accelerate the solidifying process by photo-polymerization. In spite of considerable care not to inhale mercury vapor or swallow minute particles of dental amalgam during the process of removing it by drilling, mercury entered the body of the subject. Precautions such as the use of a rubber dam and strong air suction, as well as frequent water suctioning and washing of the mouth were insufficient. Significant deposits of mercury, previously non-existent, were found in the lungs, kidneys, endocrine organs, liver, and heart with abnormal low-voltage ECGs (similar to those recorded 1-3 weeks after i.v. injection of radioisotope Thallium-201 for Cardiac SPECT) in all the limb leads and V1 (but almost normal ECGs in the precordial leads V2-V6) the day after the procedures were performed. Enhanced mercury evaporation by increased temperature and microscopic amalgam particles created by drilling may have contributed to mercury entering the lungs and G.I. system and then the blood circulation, creating abnormal deposits of mercury in the organs named above. Such mercury contamination may then contribute to intractable infections or pre-cancer. However, these mercury deposits, which commonly occur in such cases, were successfully eliminated by the oral intake of 100 mg tablet of Chinese parsley (Cilantro) 4 times a day (for average weight adults) with a number of drug-uptake enhancement methods developed by the 1st author, including different stimulation methods on the accurate organ representation areas of the hands (which have been mapped using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test), without injections of chelating agents. Ingestion of Chinese parsley, accompanied by drug-uptake enhancement methods, was initiated before the amalgam removal procedure and continued for about 2 to 3 weeks afterwards, and ECGs became almost normal. During the use of strong bluish curing light to create a photo-polymerization reaction to solidify the synthetic filling material, the adjacent gingiva and the side of the tongue were inadvertently exposed. This exposure to the strong bluish light was found to produce pre-cancerous conditions in the gingiva, the exposed areas of the tongue, as well as in the corresponding organs represented on those areas of the tongue, and abnormally increased enzyme levels in the liver. These abnormalities were also successfully reversed by the oral intake of a mixture of EPA with DHA and Chinese parsley, augmented by one of the non-invasive drug-uptake enhancement methods previously described by the 1st author, repeated 4 times each day for 2 weeks.",

These studies are consistent with previous data and values expected for a return of function following Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) damage. This work represents the first detailed investigation of a dose response in the PNS using applied electric fields. As such, using the stimulator design described herein, we have found that a delivery of 1.4 microA DC (about 8mV/cm field strength) to a nerve cuff will result in a more rapid increase of axon numbers in the distal slump with no detectable adverse influence of chronic delivery of current. Since it appears as though the regenerative capacity in the PNS and CNS is related to increased blood flow brought upon by the electric field, then it is important to consider this result in the final analysis of the mechanism of electric field induced nerve regeneration. Studies aimed at describing the mechanisms by which such regeneration occurs are now underway.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) on the oxidative stress, the spinal cord tissue preservation and the recovery of motor function was evaluated after a traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). Long Evans rats were randomized into five groups: 1. Sham; 2. TSCI without treatment; 3. TSCI + EA (acupoint GV.4); 4. TSCI + EA (acupoint GV.26) and 5. TSCI + EA (GV.4 + GV.26). The EA was performed with an Electro-Acupunctoscope, AWQ-104L Digital, wave dense-dispersed, current intensity 2.5mA and frequency 2-100Hz for 30 minutes. The biochemical results showed a significant increase in the hydroxyl radical concentration in group 2 (3.1±1.4nmol) compared with groups 1 (1.8±0.5nmol) and 4 (2.4±1.1nmol) (p&lt;0.05), whereas in group 4 (4.8±1.8nmol), there was a significant increase in lipid peroxidation when compared with group 1 (1.7±0.5nmol) (p&lt;0.05). The BBB motor function score in the paralyzed hind limbs (normal BBB=21points) was greater in groups 3 (15.2 points) and 5 (13.5 points) in comparison with groups 2 (11.4 points) and 4 (9.3 points) (p&lt;0.05). The quantity of preserved spinal cord tissue was greater in group 3 (6582.7±20μm 2 ) than in groups 2 (5262.4±20μm 2 ), 4 (3995.6±26μm 2 ) and 5 (4266.7±22μm 2 ). Although EA in GV.26 decreases hydroxyl radical concentration (50%), it significantly increases lipid peroxidation (45%), while stimulation of GV.4 decreases oxidative stress (15%), preserves spinal cord tissue (25%) and improves recovery of motor function in the hind limbs of rats with paralysis (18.1%) compared with untreated group. These findings suggest that EA in GV.4 may be a therapeutic alternative on TSCI.",

Female mice (strain; C57BL/6) were ovariectomized (OVX) and acupuncture points, Shenshu ([Japanese pictograph see text] : BL23) on both side of the back were continuously stimulated by subcutaneous needles for 20 days. After completion of experimental sessions, animals were sacrificed and specific brain regions were assayed for catecholamine contents by high performance liquid chromatography with electro chemical detector (ECD-HPLC). The mitogenic activities of splenic lymphocytes were measured by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTS) assay and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay. Furthermore, the effects of needle stimulation on learning and memory ability were studied by the step-through type passive avoidance test. Norepinephrine and dopamine contents in the frontoparietal cerebral cortex, ventral hippocampus and olfactory bulb were decreased in the OVX group, and both MTS activity and ALP activity were decreased 20 days after ovariectomy. The mean latent period was also shortened in the passive avoidance test in the OVX group. However, applying needle stimulation increased norepinephrine and dopamine contents in the brain regions, and enhanced mitogenic activities of splenic lymphocytes. The stimulation also improved memory-related behavior. It was concluded from this study that after mice were stimulated by subcutaneous needle insertion, overall changes were observed in central nervous system (including retention of memory) and immune functions. The study suggests that acupuncture improves the memory loss and decrease of immune responses accompanying aging and/or menopause, and the that it may have an important role in medical care for the elderly.",

EA of \"Zusanli (St. 36), Sanyinjiao(Sp. 6), Hegu(L.I.4) and Neiguan(P.6) points enhanced the NK cell activities after epidural injection of morphine.

When EA applied after naloxone microinjected into PAG, the NK cell activity was further augmented as compared to that using EA or PAG microinjection of naloxone alone. The above results suggest epidural morphine combined with EA is a better method to relieve postoperative pain, and opiate receptor in PAG might partially mediate the suppression of NK cell activity induced by intrathecal injection of morphine. Yet, the mechanisms of the attenuation of EA on morphine induced immunosuppression needs further study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of present study was to observe the protective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) and Salviae Miltiorrhizae (SM) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rabbits. Acute ischemia/reperfusion of myocardium was set up by ligating left anterior descending branch of coronary artery in 24 rabbits which were divided randomly into control, EA, SM, and EA+SM group. Changes of plasma myocardial zymogram were found after ischemia in these groups. EA and SM were observed to decrease plasma IL-8 and epinephrine concentration and to increase 99mTc-MIBI intake ratio of myocardial mitochondrial, but enhancing or antagonistic effect between EA and SM was negligible. There was positive correlation between concentrations of plasma epinephrine and IL-8. The results indicated that EA and SM could reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and protect myocardial mitochondrial by reducing concentrations of plasma epinephrine and IL-8. EA and SM could reduce the release of endogenic epinephrine, which was one of the mechanisms of lowering plasma IL-8.",

However, the mechanism of how acupuncture can affect these functions is not well known. The electrophysiological study was done using anesthetized rats to examine the effect of auricular electroacupuncture. 122 neurons of the thalamus and hypothalamus were examined. 20% of the neurons in the thalamus responded either by increasing firing rate or decreasing to auricular electroacupuncture. Some thalamic neurons responded by increasing to the nociceptive stimulation and by decreasing to acupuncture stimulation. These effects might explain some part of the analgesic effect of acupuncture. 14% of the neurons of the hypothalamus, mainly in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and around the mammillothalamic tract, responded to acupuncture. The neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus did not respond. These results suggest the indirect effect on instinctual behavior, especially on feeding behavior, of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "It has been claimed that the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia can be explained in part by endogenous opioids. If so, it might be possible to enhance the analgesic effect of acupuncture by the administration of endorphins. If D-phenylalanine (DPA), an inhibitor of the endorphin degrading enzyme, is administered, the analgesic effect of acupuncture should be prolonged due to the increased level of endorphins. From the changes of the pain threshold (PT), we investigated whether or not the pre-administration of DPA can enhance the analgesic effect of acupuncture in humans. In addition, we examined the inhibitory effect of naloxone. 1) In all five subjects whose PT was raised after acupuncture anesthesia (respondents), the rise in PT was significantly prolonged by DPA. 2) Out of 10 subjects whose PT remained almost unchanged after acupuncture anesthesia (non-respondents), the PT was increased by DPA in 5 cases. 3) The rise in PT was most prominent when DPA was administered 30 minutes before the start of acupuncture anesthesia. 4) In all 4 respondents in whom the rise in PT persisted after DPA and acupuncture anesthesia, their raised PT dropped after the intravenous injection of naloxone (10 mg). 5) These findings show that DPA enhances the analgesic effect of acupuncture by the \"endorphin mechanism.\"",

This was accompanied by minimization of post-traumatic cord shrinkage in acupuncture-treated animals and a marked (3 fold) sparing of ventral horn neurons. Plasma cortisol levels rose over 3-fold within 2 hours post-operatively in non-acupuncture-treated rats, where these levels rose less than two fold in acupuncture treated animals. None of the above beneficial effects occurred in rats given acupuncture treatment 24 hrs after spinal cord injury.

    "abstract": "In 1990 Omura, Y. reported that Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 as the major cause of chronic intractable pain and its effective treatment using mixture of EPA & DHA with Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method. Subsequently among the other causes of pain, he included Chlamydia Trachomatis, Borrelia Burgdorferi, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, human Herpes Virus type 6, and Circulatory Disturbances. In order to test possible involvement of viral infection in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a disease which usually occurs in the extremities, we did a study of 17 patients with CRPS. They were examined for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) by measuring IgG and IgM antibody titers, and 14 of these patients were also examined for Cytomegalo-Virus (CMV). As a control group 100 healthy Japanese employees at SRL, Inc. were also studied. In CRPS group, HSV IgG was positive in 12 of the 17 patients with an average antibody titer of 90.0 EIA value. VZV IgG was positive in all 17 patients with an average antibody titer of 26.8 EIA value. CMV IgG was positive in all 14 patients with an average antibody titer of 66.6 UA/ml. In control group, HSV IgG was positive in 54 subjects with an average antibody titer of 42.3 EIA value. VZV IgG was positive in 97 subjects with an average antibody titer of 26.2 EIA value. CMV IgG was positive in 82 subjects. There were no significant differences of positive rate of IgG antibody for the three viruses between patient and control groups. Although the difference was not significant, the average antibody titers of HSV in CRPS group were more than twice of those in healthy group. Antibody titers were almost equal in both groups for VZV. Possibly, some people in the control group who had latent virus, were also asymptomatic. In 2000, Takasaki, I. et al. in a separate animal study, inoculated with HSV Type-I the shin of the mouse causing allodynia and hyperalgesia (which are some of the characteristic findings seen in CRPS in humans). Also, VZV, which causes shingles which is sometimes followed by Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), is in the same family of HSV. As PHN resembles CRPS in symptoms, it is possible that HSV contributes to CRPS. Therefore, virus infection theory is an attractive hypothesis that accounts for many enigmas of CRPS.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of intradental nerves has been widely used in pain research as a method for selective activation of pain pathways. It is believed that the only sensation experienced by human subjects in response to activation of pulp nerves is that of pain. However, this concept is not strictly correct. With electrical stimulation at threshold level or near to it a sensation which is not necessarily painful (\"prepain\") is experienced. When the stimulus intensity is increased suprathreshold, the sensation tends to change to a painful and unpleasant one. The changes in sensations are probably caused by activation of intradental nerve units with different thresholds and conduction velocities. In cats the fastest conducting pulp nerve fibres have the lowest thresholds and slowly conducting units are activated at much higher current levels. In most experiments on human teeth using natural stimuli like hot and cold the only sensation experienced has been pain. It seems also difficult for the subjects to find any difference between different stimuli. Correspondingly, in animal experiments it has been shown that different stimuli applied to dentine are capable of activating the same intradental nerve units probably with a common mechanism (hydrodynamic). However, some recent studies indicate that sensation of cold could be induced by stimulating human teeth.",

Rats were exposed chronically (1st - 4th week) to a variety of mild unpredictable stresses. The tricyclic antidepressant chlorimipramine and EA were administrated on these depressive rats for 6 weeks (5th - 11th week). EA was applied at points of \"Bai-Hui\" (Du 20) and \"An-Mian\" (EX 17) (right side), by EA apparatus (Model 6805-2, Shanghai). Dense (60Hz/5sec)-sparse (4Hz/2.5sec) frequency of the wave was selected and the current intensity (< or = 1mA) was adjusted to provoke slight twitches of the rat's ear. The preference for 1% sucrose solution and the immobility time in the forced swimming test were measured as the symptoms of anhedonia and depressed mood, which were central features of major depression. The preference for 1% sucrose solution was reduced by CMS, but could be restored to normal level after 6 weeks treatment with chlorimipramine at 5mg/kg or EA combined with chlorimipramine at 2.5mg/kg. In the forced swimming test, the immobility time of depressive rats was decreased in both groups. However, the preference for sucrose and the immobility time in the depressive rats were not significantly changed by the treatment with only EA or chlorimipramine at 2.5 mg/kg. The results suggested that EA could potentiate the antidepressant effect of chlorimipramine in low dose, and EA combined with antidepressant might be a better method in treating depression.",

When measured non-invasively using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT), brain tumors had the highest concentration of Asbestos (0.2 approximately 2.1 mg BDORT units). Relatively high levels of Asbestos (0.2 approximately 0.6 mg BDORT units) were found in: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the lungs & esophagus, Adenocarcinoma of the larynx & breast, myelogenic leukemia, arteries of these cancers, left ventricle of failing heart, myocardial infarction, some of the narrowed arteries, varicose veins, cataracts, balding heads, hot flashes, Alzheimer's Disease and Autism. A small, round or ellipsoidal area, with diameter of 5 mm or less, was found near the center of every cancer tissue with a higher level of Asbestos (1 approximately 3 mg), As, Zn, Cr and Se, than in the rest of the tumor; this small area may be where the cancer initiated. Among areas of intractable pain with frequent recurrence and gradual worsening, about 0.2 approximately 0.5 mg BDORT units (or higher) of Asbestos were found. The author found that in the Astrocytoma and many other cancer patients, the optimal dose of DHEA produced very significant reductions of cancer cell telomere from over 1400 ng in the brain tumors (and over 900 ng in other cancers) to close to or less than 1 yg (=10(-24) g), with circulatory improvement by reduction of TXB2. Unlike the standard, widely used treatment with DHEA 25 approximately 50 mg daily, which is an overdose; we only gave one optimal dose (1.5 approximately 12.5 mg) and the beneficial effects usually lasted anywhere between 3-6 months, unless inhibiting factors were introduced. In addition, once one optimal dose of DHEA was given, the amount of Asbestos from these tumors decreased very significantly (30 approximately 99% reduction) with marked increase in urine Asbestos. One optimal dose of special Cilantro tablet reduced more Asbestos than DHEA or (+) Qi Gong Energy Stored Paper. In addition, the application of (+) Solar Energy Stored Paper often reduces 70 approximately 99% of the Asbestos, while (+) Qi Gong Energy Stored Paper reduces 50 approximately 99% of the Asbestos.",

    "abstract": "The effect of acupuncture stimulation at Zusanli point (ST.36) on the bioavailability of radio-pharmaceutical 99mTc-sodium pertechnetate (Na99mTcO4) in Wistar rats was investigated. Ten healthy rats were allocated into two groups of five. Group 1 (n=5) was treated by acupuncture by inserting stainless steel needles bilaterally at ST.36; Group 2 was the untreated control. Ocular plexus administration of 0.3ml of Na99mTcO4 (3.7MBq) was carried out 10 minutes after every needle insertion. The rats were killed 25 minutes later. The organs were isolated, the radioactivity determined in a well gamma counter, and the percentage of injected radio-pharmaceutical dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) was assessed for each organ. The %ID/g varied significantly (p<0.05) between Group 1 and Group 2 in pancreas (0.91 +/- 0.17 vs 0.15 +/- 0.03), stomach (7.97 +/- 0.68 vs 3.51 +/- 0.22), spleen (0.97 +/- 0.11 vs 0.41 +/- 0.14), brain (0.19 +/- 0.09 vs 0.09 +/- 0.04), kidneys (0.91 +/- 0.17 vs 0.15 +/- 0.03), heart (0.81 +/- 0.17 vs 0.31 +/- 0.02) and testis (0.46 +/- 0.04 vs 0.14 +/- 0.03). These findings suggest that the effect of acupuncture at ST.36 modulated organs and tissues responses in rats. Using Chinese theories of Zang-Fu and Five Phases, we suggest that the relationship between acupoints and organs may be related to neuromodulation mechanisms such as somatovisceral reflex responses, which play an important role in the autonomic nervous system. These results also suggest that the effect of acupuncture on the bio-availability of radio-pharmaceuticals may help our understanding of the action of acupuncture points on various organs and tissues.",

    "abstract": "I-Ching or Yi-Jing ([see text] also known as The Book of Changes) is the earliest classic in China. It simply explained the formation of the universe and the relationship of man to the universe. Most, if not all, branches of various knowledge, including traditional Chinese medicine, can be traced back its origin to this Book in which Fu Shi ([see text] 2852 B.C.) theorized how the universe was formed, through his keen observation of environment and orbits of sun, moon and stars. He used symbols to represent his views. The essence of I-Ching is basically the expression and function of Yang symbolized as \"--\" (from <---->) and Yin symbolized \"- -\" (from --><--), and [see text] Yin and Yang as interaction and circulation of Yang and Yin. Both Yin and Yang were derived from the same origin, Tai-Chi. Fu Shi believed Yin and Yang were the two opposite background force and energy that make the universe as what it is. Yang and Yin manifest in great variety of phenomena such as mind and body, masculine and feminine, sun and moon, hot and cold, heaven and earth, positive and negative electricity etc. The entire theory of Chinese medicine is based on the theories of Yin and Yang as well as that of 5 Element Cycles which are also related to the orderly arrangement of 8 trigrams ([see text]) by King Wen ([see text]1099-1050 B.C.). The 5 Elements Theory explains the \"check and balance\" mechanism created by the background force of Yin and Yang Qi and illustrated the relationships that are either strengthened or weakened by \"acting and controlling\" among the 5 elements. I-Ching has exerted profound influences on some well- known European philosophers and scientists, notably Leibnitz and Hegel. Between I-Ching and modern cosmology and the physics of sub-atomic particles, there are some basic theories in common.",

Existing researches had reported that Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) was an effective treatment method instead of manual acupuncture. In place of the TEAS, we suggested the Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMFs). Thus, we designed the PEMFs system which can stimulate only an acupoint. There have been no researches which reported therapeutic effect when stimulating at an identical acupoint by TEAS and PEMFs. Hence, this study investigated the therapeutic effect on the muscle fatigue after the strenuous knee extension/flexion exercise by two stimulations. We selected the stimulation method of both TEAS and PEMFs by using 2Hz biphasic rectangular wave pulse and pulse width 0.2ms. The magnetic flux was the 30.92mT (309.2gauss) at 2 Hz. The electromyogram (EMG) and the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) at rectus femoris were measured. The Median Frequency (MF) at TEAS group was significantly effective at 6 minutes ( p =0.499). The PEMFs group was recovered to the MF rapidly after 4 minutes ( p =0.166). The results of the peak torque indicated that both non-stimulation group and TEAS group did not recover to the peak torque at pre-exercise during the recovery period ( p &lt;0.05). In contrast, the significant treatment effect of PEMFs group was found after 14 minutes ( p =0.135). The results of this study demonstrated that PEMFs were better than TEAS as a non-invasive method to replace the manual acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Posology concerns science and system of dosage. Conventionally the dosage systems of measurement are the apothecaries' and metric systems and the dosage calculation for each individual patient has been suggested according to several available methods, namely Clark's Rule, Fried's Rule, Young's Rule, body surface area, or mg/kg, etc. There are many factors affect the availability of a drug to its site of action in the body, and their relation to the time course of drug action and variation in each drug response with or without the other drugs taken simultaneously. The correct dosage requires meticulous and accurate calculation. In busy offices, some may feel the dosage calculation is tedious. This article reviews the conventional methods of dosage calculations and the allergy tests, followed by describing a simple way to determine the proper dosage for each patient by simplifying the Clark's concept based on the body weight and verify the optimum dosage with Bi-Digital O-Ring Test minimize the adverse drug reactions and to increase safety for drug administration.",

    "abstract": "Skin is the biggest and most important organ of us. It has a large surface area and it is easily accessible. While we touch skin, piezoelectric stimulation starts, fundamental property of biological tissues, pressure electrification. And after this stimulation, ferroelectric and pyroelectric effects occur. While we insert the acupuncture needle into skin, we have created a conscious trauma and damage. After this, inflammatory phase, proliferation and tissue formation phase and tissue remodeling phase start. With embryological perspective, at that moment, we give stimulus ectodermal and mesodermal layer of the skin also. We stimulate these embryologic layers and cells not only into skin but also whole body. Because, while we start stimulation with a cell, cell stimulates other cells and cells stimulate body. Also we stimulate neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, neuro-hormones and receptors. The skin is the largest immunologically active receptor organ in the body. And we see, peripheral local stress response (brain-skin) works same as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. So, what we have done? We only insert the acupuncture needle into skin consciously.",

    "abstract": "Regarding the effects of electro-acupuncture for severe hypertension, we assessed its acute cardiovascular consequences with 4 subjects of the chronic atrioventricular block dogs having severe hypertension and chronic heart failure. The electro-acupuncture consisting of 2 mA at 2 Hz frequency was carried out for 30 min at Renying (ST-9) and Taichong (LR-3) every other day. Seven sessions were performed within 2 weeks. In the 1st and 7th sessions, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital to analyze the effects of the electro-acupuncture on cardiovascular variables. No significant change was detected in any of the basal control values of the cardiohemodynamic or electrophysiological variables between the 1st and 7th sessions. During the 1st session, electo-acupuncture produced a peak increase in mean blood pressure by 8.7% at 35 min ( p &lt;0.05), whereas during the 7th session the peak increase was 6.5% at 35 min (p=0.06). There was no significant change in the cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, a product of the heart rate and systolic blood pressure (=double product) reflecting myocardial oxygen consumption, QRS width or QT interval during the electrical stimulation in the 1st or 7th session. The results suggest that electroacupuncture may not exert lethal adverse effect except the vasopressor response, but that it can decrease the treatment-induced sympathetic response including vasopressor reaction and tachycardia. Since electro-acupuncture may have some potential to induce hypertensive crisis at the beginning, clinicians have to pay attention on its use for patients with hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) has a significant role in various cancers and Alzheimer's disease. 500 breast cancer mammograms as well as 3 cases of adenocarcinomas of esophagus, stomach, colon, prostate gland, uterus, ovary that was examined had significant infection of HPV- 16 with significantly increased β- amyloid (1-42). When a strong HPV-16 infection is found in the oral cavity, repeated exposure to the infected individual's coughing can infect others easily through saliva. Just like all of above cancer tissues, all 20 Alzheimer's cases that were examined had significantly increased HPV-16 of 1500-3000ng with markedly reduced Acetylcholine of 0.5~1.5ng and significantly increased 3- amyloid (1-42) of 7.5ng or higher. Since every cancer and Alzheimer's patient examined had significantly reduced amounts of Vitamin D3 and Taurine, the author examined the effects of Vitamin D3 and Taurine independently, or by combination. Each of optimal doses of Vitamin D3 and Taurine had significant beneficial effects that were anti-cancer, anti-cardiac ischemia, and memory loss & other brain problems, with significant excretion of HPV- 16 and bacteria such as Borrelia Burgdorferi, if it exists, through the urine, without using any anti-viral or anti-bacterial agents. However, when optimal doses of Taurine and Vitamin D3 were used together, 3 times/day, there was reduction of cancer-associated Oncogene CfosAB-2 or Integrin a5p1 with significantly high values of 200-500ng which were reduced to 0.001-0.004ng. Memory and brain function improved by increasing markedly reduced abnormal Acetylcholine of 1.5ng or less to a few hundred-2500ng with increase in DHEA. Abnormally increased P-amyloid (1-42) is markedly reduced. Ischemic heart, where there is abnormally increased Cardiac Troponin I, reduced significantly. In addition, abnormally reduced DHEA levels often increase. HPV- 16 in urine increased from an average of 100~15ng to an average of 4000ng and cancer related parameters in the urine significantly increased. Thus, the author found combined use of optimal dose of Vitamin D3 400 I.U. and optimal dose of Taurine 175mg, 3/day, was found to be one of the safest, most effective treatments for cancer, memory problems & other brain abnormality, and Ischemic heart problems, and this combination seems to improve any part of the body. One should try this method before using any other treatment, which has a potential side effect.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of the auricle is considered to be an effective analgesic technique. The aim of the present study is to establish whether there is a correspondence between somatic inflammation and the appearance of lower resistance points, and moreover, whether the stimulation of such points has an analgesic effect. The study has been conducted on 57 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 120-140 g; 7 of them have been used to determine whether inflammation in the paw leads to the formation of lower resistance points on the auricle. The 50 remaining animals have been divided into 5 groups: Group 1 [12 animals], control were subjected to all manipulations with the exception of the auricle stimulation; Group 2 [12] was stimulated with manual acupuncture in the area corresponding to that observed in the above-mentioned first group of 7 animals; Group 3 [12] was stimulated with 5 Hz and 5 mA; electroacupuncture (EAP) Group 4 [8] and group 5 [6] were treated with acupuncture and with EAP respectively on points believed to be inactive in areas diametrically opposite to the ones observed in the first group. After acupuncture, 100 microg capsaicin in 50 microL of physiological solution were injected subcutis in the dorsal surface of the paw. Edema response was monitored for two hours, with measurement taken every 5 minutes. The results show a reduction in the edema response, only in the group treated with EAP on the appropriate points compared to the control group; no variation was observed in the sham groups. To conclude, the hypothesis of a somatotopic division would seem to be probable, and it would seem that the stimulation of the appropriate areas and the use of an appropriate intensity constitute the two main variables influencing the result.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that dopamine (DA) is involved in electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA). L-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP), a DA receptor antagonist was proved to potentiate EAA in both laboratory research and clinical practice. In the present study SK&F-38393 and quinpirole (Qui), selective agonists of D1 or D2 receptors respectively were injected into nucleus (N.) accumbens of rats to investigate the roles of D1 and D2 receptors in the potentiation of EAA induced by l-THP. The injection of D1 agonist SK&F-38393 (5 microg or 10 microg) attenuated the potentiation of EAA induced by l-THP, 10 microg SK&F-38393 attenuated EAA as well, while the injection of D2 agonist Qui (10 microg or 20 microg) had no effect on EAA and the potentiation of EAA induced by l-THP. DA release was shown to increase in EAA in previous work, however, whether the synthesis of DA was influenced is still unknown. In the present study, dot blot technique was applied to observe the effect of noxious stimulation or electroacupuncture on the level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA in rat brain. Noxious electric stimulation was found to elevate the TH mRNA level in substantia nigra (SN) and hypothalamus, while electro-acupuncture attenuated the effect of noxious stimulation on TH mRNA. The results indicate that D1 but not D2 receptor in N. accumbens plays an important role in EAA. EA might regulate the biosynthesis of DA by altering the TH gene transcription.",

Two subjects were tested for their ability to direct their intention to either wind or unwinding DNA presented to them in a quartz cuvette. Conformational changes of the DNA solutions were assessed by measuring the absorption spectra before and after treatment with bioenergy. The results confirm previous experiments indicating that focused human intentionality can produce significant changes in DNA conformation. The results extend previous studies by demonstrating the dynamic changes in DNA conformation over time are complex and dependent on the type of bioenergy generated. Different subjects produced different types of conformational change as indicated by shifts in the absorption spectra at either 260 nm or 310 nm. In some cases, bioenergy produced a decrease absorption at 260nm (reflecting DNA winding) and an increase absorption at 310nm. This is an anomalous response of DNA to bioenergy indicating the conformational changes observed are not due to simple winding and unwinding of the DNA helix",

    "abstract": "Analgesia caused by intraperitoneal 0.5 mg/kg morphine (MA) in rats is equivalent to acupuncture analgesia (AA) caused by low frequency stimulation of the tibial muscle (Tsusanli acupuncture point). Analgesia equivalent to both AA and MA was produced by intrathecal application of 0.05 microgram morphine. This analgesia exhibits individual variation in effectiveness which is parallel to those of both AA and MA, and disappears after 250 mg/kg intraperitoneal D-phenylalanine. Analgesia that persisted after termination of acupuncture stimulation was not affected, maximally developed MA and AA were both partially antagonized, and the initial development of AA and MA were completely antagonized by intrathecal application of 0.2 microgram naloxone. Analgesia caused by intrathecal 0.05 microgram morphine was abolished by bilateral lesion of the anterolateral tract (ALT) of the spinal cord and that caused by acupuncture stimulation was abolished by contra-lateral lesion. Analgesia caused by larger doses (0.1-0.2 microgram) of intrathecal morphine was not abolished, but persisted after ALT lesion, unilateral lesion of the dorsal periaqueductal central gray (D-PAG), or hypophysectomy. Potentials were evoked by acupuncture stimulation in the bilateral D-PAG. Analgesia produced by D-PAG stimulation was not affected by ALT lesion nor by intrathecal naloxone, but was abolished by lesion of the dorsolateral funiculus. These results imply two types of morphine action in the spinal cord to produce analgesia: activation of the ascending AA pathway; and direct inhibition of pain message in the spinal cord. They also show that the AA producing pathway ascends contralaterally in the ALT and then bilaterally in the D-PAG.",

A total of 13 healthy adult volunteers were studied. The electrical stimuli were delivered to the posterior tibial nerve transcutaneously at the left popliteal fossa to evoke the soleus H-reflex. MA, 2Hz TENS, 100 Hz TENS, respectively, was applied to the surface of the right first dorsal interosseous muscle exactly at the Hegu acupoint (LI.4). Four assessments were performed randomly, separated by an interval of at least three days in all the subjects as follows: 1) Control assessment: a pair of electrodes placed on the surface of the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4), but no electrical stimulation was delivered throughout the test; 2) MA assessment: MA was done at the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4) for 15 minutes; 3) TENS assessment at 2Hz: electrical stimulation (40 mA in intensity) at 2Hz was applied to the surface of the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4) for 15 minutes; 4) TENS assessment at 100 Hz: electrical stimulation (20 mA in intensity) at 100 Hz was applied to the surface of the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4) for 15 minutes. Each assessment was divided into three periods as follows: 1) Baseline period: H-reflexes recorded prior to MA or TENS; 2) TENS period: six H-reflex recordings after MA or TENS for a duration of 4-5 min, 9-10 min and 14-15 min, respectively; 3) Post TENS period: H-reflex recordings of 6 after TENS period 4-5 min and 9-10 min, respectively. Our results indicate that both 2Hz TENS and 100 Hz TENS increased the amplitude of the H-reflex, and that these increases may be retained longer with 100 Hz TENS than with 2 Hz TENS, whereas MA could not increase the amplitude of the H-reflex. MA, TENS at 2 Hz or 100 Hz didn't change the latencies of the H-reflexes. We conclude that both 2Hz and 100 Hz TENS increased the amplitude of the H-reflex, suggesting that TENS enhances the excitability of the motoneuron pool in the spinal cord, and 100 Hz TENS has a greater effect than 2Hz TENS, whereas MA was not similar effect to TENS on spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that the cerebral cortex plays a modulator role in the physiological mechanisms of acupuncture and 2Hz electroacupuncture (EA), but either acupuncture or 2Hz EA appeared to have very little effect on spinal cord. However, 2Hz or 100Hz transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied to Hegu acupuncture point (LI.4) can increase the amplitude of the H-reflex, whereas manual acupuncture has no similar effect. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to further investigated the effect of 2Hz EA, 2Hz or 100Hz TENS on cutaneous reflex (CR). A total of 13 healthy adult volunteers were studied. CR recordings were obtained on the right first dorsal interosseous muscle by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral index finger. 2Hz EA, 2Hz or 100Hz TENS was applied to the surface of the left LI.4, and then the changes of CR were observed. The results indicated that CR was characterized by an initial short latency excitatory wave (E1), followed by an inhibitory wave (I1), then a long latency excitatory wave (E2). Both 2Hz EA and 2Hz TENS applied to the surface of the left LI.4 could prolong the latencies of I1 component of CR, whereas 100Hz TENS has no similar effect. In addition, either EA or TENS could not change the latencies of E1, E2 component and the amplitudes of I1, E2 component of CR. In conclusion, 2Hz EA or 2Hz TENS applied to the LI.4 prolonged the latencies of I1 component of CR, suggesting that the action site of 2Hz EA or 2Hz TENS located in the supraspinal, possibly in the subcortical or cortical level. In addition, the electrical stimulation of higher frequency such as 100Hz TENS acting on CR caused habituation easier.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of the endogenous analgesia systems in the mechanism of analgesia produced by electrical stimulation of the brain or resulting from certain stressful manipulations seems now well-established. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether acupuncture as a method of peripheral sensory stimulation activates, like central stimulation, the endogenous opiate system. Plasma concentrations of ACTH and the best known endogenous opiates: beta-endorphin, met- and leu-enkephalin, were determined before and after standard electroacupuncture stimulation in healthy volunteers. Acupuncture stimulation resulted in a significant (p less than 0.005) decrease of plasma beta-endorphin-like immuno-reactivity (B-EPLI), but plasma ACTH assayed did not change about 5 minutes after acupuncture. The authors conclude that the reaction of the beta-endorphin system to acupuncture (sensory peripheral) stimulation in humans did not involve pituitary hypersecretion, and suggest that the increase of beta-endorphin binding to the tissue receptor sites seems to be responsible for the peripheral (plasma) B-EPLI decrease after acupuncture.",

Among them, especially importance of rise and fall time which influence capacitive current (Ic = C X dv/dt), pulse duration and output impedance for (+) and (-) polarities was emphasized. When comparing one pulse component with high amplitude with the other pulse component with low amplitude in the same stimulation pulse complex of the same electrical stimulator, effective stimulation voltage delivered to the body can be larger with the low amplitude pulse component if it has much lower output impedance than the other. When pulse repetition rate is higher than several pulses/sec., in spite of increase in pain threshold, microcirculation is often interfered with and as a result the effect will not last long after each treatment. Our studies indicate that optimal pulse repetition rate is about the same as heart rate synchronized with local circulation. Tingling threshold is a more reproducible reliable parameter than pain threshold in study of pain. Measurement of threshold potentials for tingling sensation, muscle contraction, along with pain threshold is extremely important in the same patient. Phenomena of short circuits between the nerve fibers responsible for tingling sensation and nerve fibers responsible for pain sensation is described.",

The power emitted varies between 1 and 11 mW. The instrument is placed at a fixed distance from a photovoltaic sensor whose voltage response is a linear function of the received luminous power. The voltage variations are studied as functions of the thickness of the compact bone interposed between the output of the laser and the diode. On semilogarithmic paper, we find a curve of two linear segments having different slopes. The first (between 0 and 1 mm of bone), of very sharp incline, is most probably due to an important reflexion on the bone surface; the second, with a slight incline, corresponds to the absorption which is exponential. Moreover, if the ray enters in the cortico-medullar direction, the second slope is sharper than in the case of a longitudinal penetration following the diaphyseal texture. A power of 10 mW gives a maximal penetration of about 18 mm in the bone axis direction and approximately 6 mm in the cortico-medullar direction. For eventual therapeutic indications, it is necessary to take account of reflexion on the bone surface as well as the direction of the beam in relation to the bone texture, since these two elements interfere in the diffusion of the stimulation.",

    "abstract": "A new, simple, non-invasive and inexpensive imaging method of internal organs, using the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" was developed by the author. This new imaging technique does not require any bulky expensive instruments or electric power source. Unlike currently available imaging techniques, such as NMR tomography, CAT-Scan, angiography, or ultrasonography, which expose the patient to undesirable radiation, this new imaging technique does not expose the patient to undesirable radiation, such as X-rays, strong magnetic field, ultra-sound, etc. Material required for this present simplest form is a sample of internal organs in the form of a microscopic slide or a small piece of dessicated internal organ from a human or animal and a fine probe, or its alternative method (using a focused beam of light or a positive electrical field). The imaging can be carried out any place in any emergency situation, even in a place where there are no medical facilities or electricity. In addition to imaging of the internal organs, without any prior knowledge of the patient's chief complaint or history, not only can the presence or absence of cancer of specific internal organs be suspected, even in very small size, but also the exact location of such a suspected area within the specific internal organ can be localized, even when NMR tomography or CAT-Scan has failed to detect the cancer. As a further extension of the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" application and imaging technique, the presence or absence of specific bacteria can be suspected and localized, using the patient's \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" response to glass slides of pure bacteria, which can often be confirmed by bacterial culture, when culturing is feasible. Imaging of different internal organs, including the heart, blood vessels, pancreas, gall bladder, duodenum, bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, kidneys, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, thymus networks, appendix, etc. were studied. Also, detection and localization of cancer of the head of the pancreas was studied, and some of the clinical examples of these various studies are shown in this article. When the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" of the pancreas representation area showed minus 3 or minus 4, the author often found an abnormally enlarged body of the pancreas, with prolonged and enlarged tail of the pancreas, with suspected bacterial infection in that part of the pancreas, often accompanied by enlarged gall bladder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The author evaluated the effects of DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) on the amount of telomeres of normal cells and cancer cells and found the following: Contrary to the literature, which often recommended 25-50 mg of DHEA daily for the average adult human being, the author found that, depending on the individual, the maximum increase of normal cell telomere was obtained by a single optimal dose of 1.25-12.5 mg. This was examined in 50 people, both males and females, between the ages of 20-80 years old. When one optimal dose was given to each individual, the average telomere amount in normal tissues, measured in Bi-Digital O-Ring Test units, often increased from anywhere between 25-300 ng to between 500-530 ng. Cancer cell telomere reduced from higher than 1100 ng to less than 1 yg (=10(-24) g) with equally significant normalization of abnormal cancer parameters (such as Integrin alpha5beta1, Oncogen C-fosAb2, Acetylcholine, etc.). Circulatory improvement and an increase in grasping force of up to 25% were also detected, along with the changing of a few white hairs to black hairs. The beneficial effects of one optimal dose of DHEA generally lasted between 1 to 4 months, though in some individuals it lasted for a much shorter period of time due to a number of negative factors such as excessive stress/work, excessive exposure to low temperatures and toxic substances, or use of common pain medicines. On the other hand, if a patient took an excessive dose of DHEA, the amount of normal cell telomere decreased, while there was an increase in cancer cell telomere. It was found that those who took an overdose of 25-50 mg daily for more than 3 months had a high incidence of cancer of the prostate gland, breast, colon, lung, and stomach. Also, when the average normal cell telomere levels were less than 110 ng, compared with a normal value of 120-130 ng, and when DHEA in different parts of the body was also extremely low (less than 1-2 ng), one could suspect the possible presence of a malignant tumor somewhere in the body. When normal cell telomere was less than 110 ng, most individuals felt very weary with marked tiredness in the eyes, and grasping force was often reduced.",

The effect included temporary disappearance of headache, toothache, chest and abdominal pain, and backache, often with improved memory & concentration. Since these beneficial changes resembled the effects of giving one optimal dose of DHEA, increase of DHEA was measured. Above mechanical stimulation of one of these front teeth increased abnormally reduced DHEA levels of less than 10 ng to norm1 100 approximately 130 ng BDORT units and normal cell (NC) telomeres from markedly reduced values to near normal values, and improved acetylcholine in the Hippocampus. Large organ representation areas for the Adrenal gland & Hippocampus may exist at these front teeth. This method can be used for emergency pain control and can explain the beneficial effect of bruxism and tooth brushing, through the increase of DHEA levels and activities of the Hippocampus by increasing Acetylcholine. Increasing NC telomere to optimally high level resulted in disappearance of pain and improvement or significant reduction of malignant tumor. Repeated daily press needle stimulation of True ST. 36 increased NC telomere 450-700 ng BDORT units. One optimal dose of DHEA increased NC telomere 525 ng DBORT units and eliminated the pain and abnormally increased cancer parameters; effect of one optimal dose lasted 0.5-11 months. One optimal dose of Boswellia Serrata or Astragalus not only increased NC telomere 650 ng BDORT units, eliminating pain and cancer parameters, but also reduced the size of the Astrocytoma grade I by 10-20% and the Glioblastoma by 15-90% in less than 2-6 months in some patients, as long as high NC telomere is maintained.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Acupuncture is increasing in popularity as a complementary and alternative medicine. Pneumothorax is the most common and potentially serious adverse effect after acupuncture. This complication can cause fatality in the absence of rapid treatment. Here, we analyze the clinical presentation and discuss prevention of post-acupuncture pneumothorax and an approach to reducing this complication. Methods: Patients presenting with post-acupuncture pneumothorax in our hospital center during 2011-2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Body mass index (BMI), patient's pre-acupuncture chief complaint and disease, and the characteristics associated with pneumothorax were assessed. The diagnosis of pneumothorax was based on clinical presentation and chest radiography. Conservative treatment or thoracostomy was performed. Results: Seventeen patients (15 women and 2 men) with a mean age of 42 years (range: 18–73 years) were included; three were underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5kg/m2), 11 patients had a healthy weight (BMI = 18.5–22.95kg/m2), one was overweight (BMI = 23–24.95kg/m2), and two were obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2). All but one case of bilateral pneumothorax had unilateral pneumothorax (right side: 6; left side: 10). Chest pain or dyspnea, or both were the initial symptoms in all patients. Twelve patients underwent immediate thoracostomy. The patient with bilateral pneumothorax underwent right-side thoracostomy, and subsequently left-side thoracostomy, due to progression of the left-side pneumothorax. Five patients were successfully managed conservatively. All patients had an excellent outcome; all were asymptomatic and exhibited a normal chest X-ray at follow-up. Conclusion: Acupuncturists must be aware that delayed diagnosis and management of pneumothorax are life-threatening, and when symptoms of possible pneumothorax arise, patients should be advised to undergo an appropriate evaluation and intervention, particularly so in those with abnormal BMI.",

In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial subjects (N=70) from TCM treated outpatients were randomized to receive TCM based acupuncture with manual stimulation (experimental) or sham stimulation (control) treatment. Acupuncture was applied to SP6 for 20 minutes on the spleen meridian of the foot in experimental subjects and controls received sham intervention. Significant changes between pre- and post-intervention were found in all electrical conductance values for the 12 meridians (Ryodoraku scores) in either control or experimental groups (fold change from 1.15 to 2.03) (P values &lt;0.001). Eight meridians showed significantly different changes in Ryodoraku scores between pre- and post-intervention in the experimental group compared to the control group (fold change from 1.16 to 1.36) (P&lt;0.05). EEG wave signals did not change with intervention in either group (P values ≥0.209). In summary, acupuncture at the SP6 acupoint altered meridian electrical activity of the lung, pericardium, heart, small intestine, sanjiao, spleen, bladder, and stomach meridians (P values &lt;0.05) in patients with insomnia. Further studies are necessary to evaluate how changes in these meridians may affect insomnia.",

For needle phobic patients, acupuncture treatment can be a dreadful experience, as multiple needles are usually used. It is stressful for both clinicians and patients when the patients are put in an extremely apprehensive state. Our research for combining both acupuncture and hypnosis has revealed that synergy does exist in both, and that hypnosis does augment the effect of acupuncture, resulting in better treatment outcomes. Since many acupuncture patients who are needle phobic do not return for further treatment even though acupuncture has rendered good therapeutic results for them, stress reduction with hypnosis is, therefore, a welcome complimentary adjunct that would enable them to return for further needed acupuncture treatment if and when the factor of fear of the needle is removed.",

The electromagnetic (EM) component of ultra low frequency (ULF) \"brainwaves\" appears to enable perfect fitting with narrowed limits of conscious capacity in normal awake states and very extended limits in altered states of consciousness - due to the biophysical relativistic mechanism of dilated subjective time base. An additional complex low-dielectric (epsilon r approximately 1) structure is also necessary in these processes. This structure can be related to a displaced (from the body) part of acupuncture ionic system which can conduct ULF brainwave currents approximately 10(-7) A, inside the conductive channels of the initial ionic concentration approximately 10(-15) cm-3, with a tendency of deterioration during a period of approximately 1 hour. It provides an extraordinary biophysical basis for traditional psychology, including trans-personal experiences down to the ultimate state of thoughtless consciousness. Notions, such as \"qi\", \"subtle body\", and \"causal body\", are physically inevitably associated with ions, displaced (from the body) part of acupuncture ionic structure, and in it embedded an EM component of ULF brainwaves, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The role of the caudate nucleus in acupuncture analgesia was studied in 17 patients receiving caudate stimulation through chronic implanted electrodes to relieve intractable pain caused by late malignancy. Electrical stimulation of the head of the caudate nucleus provided relief from intractable pain in all 17 patients. The pain and pain tolerance threshold were elevated, the alteration in skin galvanic activity, respiratory movement and fingertip plethysmography elicited by a given painful stimulus were depressed. The analgesia required a period of induction and persisted for some time after cessation of stimulation; it showed no obvious segmental topography. These characteristics are similar to those observed in acupuncture analgesia. The effect of caudate stimulation was similar to that of electric needling in depressing the late component of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) recorded over the scalp and from the centrum medianum of the thalamus. Evoked potentials could be recorded from the caudate nucleus when an acupuncture point was electrically stimulated. The evoked potential record was a complex wave of positive and negative components, the peak latencies of main components being 100-180 msec for positive wave and 148-332 msec for negative wave components. The present study supports the supposition that the caudate nucleus may play a role in acupuncture analgesia. The possibility that the effect of caudate stimulation is brought on by inhibiting the activity of the medial thalamus is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Since 1984, using the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (Molecular Identification, Localization and) Imaging Technique\" originally developed by Y. Omura, the imaging of the outline of normal and abnormal internal organs has been successfully applied for clinical diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic effects, without the use of expensive imaging instrumentation. Not only has it become possible to non-invasively image each internal organ and localize specific malignant tumors of specific internal organs, as well as neurotransmitters, but it has also recently become possible to demonstrate the presence and exact locations of the meridians corresponding to specific internal organs and their acupuncture points along the meridians through the use of either the Direct or Indirect \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (Molecular Identification, Localization and) Imaging Techniques\" while holding a microscopic slide of the specific human internal organ tissue. However, very little information was available to demonstrate the presence of the meridians and their acupuncture points in a human cadaver. In this study, we were able to demonstrate by use of the Indirect \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (Molecular Identification, Localization and) Imaging Technique\" the presence of meridians corresponding to specific internal organs and acupuncture points on the meridians, all of which were nearly identical to those found in a living human. For example, the authors found that the stomach meridian at both ends of one of the most well-known acupuncture points, Stomach 36, is located within 1 mm of the surface of the skin, and the average diameter of the meridian is less than 1 mm. Stomach 36 in this particular cadaver had a round shape with a diameter of approximately 1.8 cm at the skin surface. The acupuncture point, St. 36, in this cadaver at the skin surface was round in shape and extended to the deepest underlying muscle layer of the tibialis anterior muscle, in three dimensions. In spite of the fact that the Indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Imaging Technique showed a distinct pathway for the stomach meridian and the location of St. 36, there was no apparent difference to the naked eye between the meridian and the surrounding non-meridian tissue, nor between St. 36 and surrounding non-acupuncture point area. However, there seems to be a more dense connective tissue network between the skin layer and the fascia on the muscle tissue at the acupuncture point, as compared with the surrounding non-acupuncture point area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

During the Qi Gong state, on the Qi-Gong Master's body, as well as the body of the patient being treated, acupuncture points CV5 (Shi Men) and CV6 (Qi Hai)-- located below the umbilicus-- show changes from +4 in the pre-Qi Gong state to between -3 and -4 during the Qi Gong state. Before and after the Qi Gong, there is a normal +4 response to the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test at these acupuncture points. Similar changes were also observed on acupuncture points CV17 (Shan Zhong), CV 22 (Tian Tu), Yin Tang (at an area just between the eyebrows: the pituitary gland representation area, colloquially known as the \"third eye\") and GV20(Bai Hui), the entire pericardium meridian & triple burner meridian, their acupuncture points, the adrenal glands, testes, ovaries and perineum, as well as along the entire spinal vertebrae, particularly on and above the 12th thoracic vertebra, medulla oblongata, pons, and the intestinal representation areas of the brain located just above and behind the upper ear. Using these findings as criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of reaching the Qi Gong state, we were able to reproduce during the experimental trials similar changes in ourselves and the patient being treated with therapeutic effects comparable to those of the Qi Gong Master. Beneficial effects of external Qi Gong treatment given by a Qi Gong practitioner 1 to 3 times for 10-20 seconds each (although most Qi Gong masters take 3-20 minutes per treatment) often resulted in improvement of circulation and lowering of high blood pressure, as well as relaxation of spastic muscles, relief of pain, and enhanced general well-being, all of which resemble acupuncture effects. In order to reproduce the same procedure with others, we selected 4 children ranging between 8 and 11 years of age who had no knowledge of Qi Gong or Oriental medicine. One of these four children, the 8 year old, was able to consistently reach the same Qi Gong state after less than a half day and another child, 11, after less than 2 days. Within a week, the other two were sometimes able to reproduce the Qi Gong state but not always. Using the Qi Gong state thus obtained, it was found that this type of Qi Gong energy is directed to specific directions from the hand and can even penetrate wooden or metal doors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

However, there has been little research to test this relationship. The purpose of this study was to determine this relationship through applying sound stimulation for 60 seconds, comprising various frequencies produced on an electric organ(Gung: 261.6 Hz; Sang: 293.7 Hz; Gak: 329.6 Hz Chi: 392.0 Hz and Wu: 440.0 Hz), to 20 healthy adults by stimulating their ears (via headphones), skin (via speakers) and both. A significant relationship was found between the tones and the meridians as they are described in Nei-Jing. The greatest response rates were found in the following corresponding organic and musical tones: spleen/Gung, lung/Sang, liver/Gak, heart/Chi, and kidney/Wu. The traditional descriptions of Yellow Emperor's Nei-Jing are therefore consistent with the findings of this study. Further basic research may lead to the application of clinically appropriate tones in an acoustically suitable room following oriental medical diagnosis.",

Dynamic changes in DNA conformation was determined in real-time by measuring the rate of DNA rewinding (in a spectrophotometer) following exposure to heat which causes the unwinding of the two strands of the helix. Cellular phone radiation produced a 40% increase in the rate of DNA rewinding. This effect was 95% attenuated when the experiment was repeated with the same cellular phone to which was attached a commercially available shielding disk shaped sheet containing a paramagnetic mineral. In a separate series of experiments the intensity of the cellular phone radiation was measured using an electromagnetic frequency spectrum analyzer. The intensity was reduced by approximately 50% in the presence of the shielding disk. Taken together these studies indicate the efficacy of a shielding disk to protect the body from cellular phone radiation.",

    "abstract": "Threadlike structures on the surfaces of mammalian internal organs were recently observed, and they can be the anatomical basis of the meridian-like network of internal organs as detected by the Bi-Digital O-Ring test imaging method. Morphological and histological studies were performed to reveal their novel features by using confocal and electron microscopy, and there is evidence that reveals that they have a ductal structure in which some liquid flows. They form a part of the network of acupuncture meridians that is thought to be a circulatory system distributed throughout an animal body. In order to confirm further the circulatory function it was necessary to provide evidences for the existence of endothelial cells at the inner boundaries of the microchannels that form the threadlike ducts. In this work we performed immunohistochemical studies for the identification of endothelial cells. In addition, we identified the extracellular matrices between the microchannels in the threadlike structure by using antifibronectin, elastin, laminin, and collagen type IV. Since immunohistochemical data are not sufficient for definite proof we supplemented the analysis with ultra structural information by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Yet TEM images show only ultrathin sections (50 nm) of a specimen, we needed to take 3-dimentional images to provide a visual demonstration of the microchannels in the threadlike ducts. We conducted high voltage electron microscopic studies for this purpose and obtained corroborating tomograms that exhibit the microchannels. In conclusion, the meridian-like tissues are ducts with microchannels, which implies the circulatory function of the acupuncture meridian network.",

This double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the result of three sessions of dry needling (DN) versus sham DN on the affected upper limbs in post-stroke survivors. We recruited 24 patients (age 57.0 ± 9.6 years; male 71%). Patients were randomly allocated to two groups: a DN group and a sham DN group. The primary outcome measures were the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS) and the Box and Block Test (BBT). Secondary outcome measures included active and passive wrist range of motion (AROM and PROM). All assessments were measured at baseline, immediately after the last session of the intervention, and one month later. Patients in the DN group had improved upper limb spasticity and passive wrist range of motion compared to control group ( P &lt; 0.05). There were no between-group differences in other outcome measures ( P &gt; 0.05). Dry needling is a useful method for improving muscle spasticity in the upper limbs of patients with stroke.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical therapeutic effectiveness and applicability of the PEMF (pulsed electro-magnetic field) acupuncture. To verify this, we observe autonomic nervous system (ANS; such as the HRV and body temperature) variation for the manual acupuncture and the PEMF acupuncture.&lt;br/&gt; Method: 56 voluntary participants were divided into three groups; non-stimulation group, manual acupuncture group (MAG), and PEMF acupuncture group (PAG). BL15 (Bladder Meridian) was selected as the stimulation area, the PEMF parameters were chosen at 2 Hz and 46mT. The HRV and body temperature were measured before and after each stimulation. The HRV at low frequency (LF; 0.04 - 0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF; 0.15 - 0.4 Hz) were analyzed to acquire LF/HF ratio.&lt;br/&gt; Results: The LF and the LF/HF ratio were found to be lower in the MAG ( p = 0.026) and the PAG ( p = 0.011), but higher in the non-stimulation group ( p = 0.778). The HF was found to be higher in the MAG ( p = 0.011) and the PAG ( p = 0.013). In BL15, the non-stimulation group had very low body temperature variation. The temperature difference in the MAG before andafter the procedure was 0.37°C; there were no significant differences ( p = 0.114). The temperature difference in the PAG was larger than that for the MAG, at 0.83°C; it was a significant difference ( p = 0.001). Conclusion: We found that the manual acupuncture and the PEMF acupuncture at BL15 activated the parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, we confirm that the PEMF acupuncture can be expected to have a similar effect as acupuncture and can be applied as a means of clinical acupuncture treatment.",

Our measurement of over 100 human adult males and females, ranging between 20-122 years old, indicated that the majority of subjects had Sirtuin 1 levels of 5-10 pg BDORT units in most parts of the body. When Sirtuin 1 was less than 1 pg, the majority of the people had various degrees of tumors or other serious diseases. When Sirtuin 1 levels were less than 0.25 pg BDORT units, a high incidence of AIDS was also detected. Very few people had Sirtuin 1 levels of over 25 pg BDORT units in most parts of the body. We selected 7 internationally recognized supercentenarians who lived between 110-122 years old. To our surprise, most of their body Sirtuin 1 levels were between 2.5-10 pg BDORT units. However, by evaluating different parts of the brain, we found that both sides of the Hippocampus had a much higher amount of Sirtuin 1, between 25-100 pg BDORT units. With most subjects, Sirtuin 1 was found to be higher in the Hippocampus than in the rest of the body and remains relatively constant regardless of age. We found that Aspartame, plastic eye contact lenses, and asbestos in dental apparatuses, which reduce normal cell telomeres, also significantly reduce Sirtuin 1. In addition, we found that increasing normal cell telomere by electrical or mechanical stimulation of True ST-36 increases the expression of the Sirtuin 1 gene in people in which expression is low. This measurement of Sirtuin 1 in the Hippocampus has become a reliable indicator for detecting potential longevity of an individual.",

The human nonlinear electromagnetic field is very weak, but it rules and regulates everything in the body. It can be justified with sensitive equipment, which measure the magnetic component (SQUID) or the electric component (our patented equipment). The measurements showed that energy is indeed transferred from the hands of healers to the patients, but surprisingly after hand healing not only was the energy of the patients higher and better balanced, the energy of the healers was always higher and better balanced, which proves involvement of a third source of energy. Since the electric energy on top of their heads, which we measured, was higher after each treatment, obviously they channel electric energy, which stimulates (from the atmosphere through the top opening of their spinning donut-shaped EMF (electromagnetic field)). However, to sedate they could suck earth's magnetic energy, which sedates, through the bottom opening of their spinning donut-shaped EMF. The greatest advantage of energy healing is that it can be used for prevention. The used equipment could detect energy imbalance 5 to 7 years before the symptoms of the disease would appear. By restoring the energy balance with energy healing or acupuncture, the disease could be prevented and the symptoms of the disease would never appear.",

With ten for each one, 50 rats were divided into 5 groups which were control group, MI group, PC6 group, LU7 (Lieque-point) group and non-acupoint group. The control group was injected normal saline solution (85 mg/kg), the other groups were injected ISO (85 mg/kg). All the rats were injected once daily for two days and recorded electrocardiograms (ECGs) after every injection. Electro-acupuncture (EA) was operated at PC6, LU7 and non-acupoint respectively in the rats of PC6 group, LU7 group and non-acupoint group after twice injections. EA was performed to these three groups with disperse-dense wave (4-20 Hz), pulse amplitude of 14V, 20 mins a day remaining 7 days. The gene and protein expressions of Kir2.1, Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 were analyzed by Western Immunoblotting Technology (Western Blot) and Real-time Fluorescence Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). But it is regrettable that we did not detect meaningful gene and protein expressions Kir2.3, and the expressions of Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 in MI induced groups were lower [The gene and protein decreased 39.4 ± 27.3% and 38.7 ± 17.1% respectively.] than control group (P < 0.05).

The results show that PC6 has a better positive effect than LU7 on MI rats, and the mechanism is probably that EA at PC6 can significantly increase the gene and protein expressions of Kir2.1 and Kir2.2.",

It has been demonstrated that in addition to analgesia, morphine increases the accumulation of SP possibly due to the inhibition of its release. The present work investigated the level of spinal SP like immunoreactivity (SPLI) following electroacupuncture analgesia in rats using immunohistochemistry and image analysis. Experiment results revealed that formalin injected into the hind paw elicited marked pain response and accumulation of SP in the spinal dorsal horn. Electroacupuncture of Tsu-San-Li could depress the pain response, however increasing further the SP accumulation. It is thus suggested that pain stimulation itself may activate the endogenous opioid mechanism to inhibit SP release and acupuncture is able to enhance the process. This may be one mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.",

Testing was carried out on 100 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120-140 g, divided into 5 groups according to the treatment received. Group 1 [20 animals] was kept as control; Group 2 [20] received ipsilateral deep acupuncture stimulation; Group 3 [20] received ipsilateral superficial acupuncture stimulation; Group 4 [20] received contralateral deep acupuncture stimulation; Group 5 [20] received superficial contralateral acupuncture stimulation. Results show that both acupuncture modalities are efficient when administered ipsilaterally to the paw where capsaicin is injected, while contralaterally only deep stimulation shows a certain efficiency. It is possible to conclude that deep insertion has a greater efficiency, probably because it affects a greater number of receptors; stimulation is therefore of an intensity greater than that seen in superficial insertion.",

    "abstract": "Unsuspected prolonged exposure to abnormal environmental (very high frequency) electro-magnetic fields (EMF), electric fields (EF) or magnetic fields (MF) at 60 Hz or 16K Hz in the bedroom or workplace may contribute to the development of various intractable medical problems. Most of the clinical symptoms appear when the individuals are exposed to EMF for many hours a day for at least several months to 1-year for relatively benign diseases or symptoms (such as intractable pain or medical problems), or several to over 10 years for more serious diseases (such as cancers of the digestive system or other organs), all of which seem to appear with the additional co-existence of micro-circulatory disturbances with Thromboxane B2 (TXB2), bacterial or viral infections and decrease or absence of acetylcholine, and lead, mercury, or aluminum deposits, with or without asbestos. These abnormal environmental EMF's or EF's can be detected by the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, which has good correlation with standard laboratory measurement, especially with EF measurement, and the distribution of EMF often includes a linear band-like appearance on the abnormal part of the patient's body, as well as on the patient's corresponding area of the bed, or at the workplace. These EMF's can be eliminated either by a metal sheet, acting as a reflector, which redirects the harmful EMF or eliminates it completely by grounding the metal sheet at high frequency range, while extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields at the near field are more difficult to eliminate. Several examples of medical problems that appear to be associated with repeated and prolonged exposure to abnormal environmental EMF, EF or MF are summarized in this article. EF or MF-induced abnormalities were artificially and reversibly created in humans by exposing the extremities or head to a 10Volt/Meter (V/M) EF at 60 Hz about 33 (evening) to 50 cm (daytime or after midnight) from a pair of rubber insulated wires connected to an AC source, but where no current is passed, so that no extra MF exists. After exposing normal parts of the extremities and head to a 10 V/M EF for 5 minutes, abnormal increase of TXB2 and disappearance or significant reduction of acetylcholine was observed for 5 minutes, and slightly longer abnormal time duration was observed in those who have aluminum, lead, or mercury deposits. This indicates that the upper limit of relatively safe EF should be around 10V/M at 60 Hz rather than 25V/M at ELF by Swedish Government recommendation, which is now widely accepted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In rabbits, auriculo-acupuncture electrostimulation with frequencies of 15 and 100 Hz induced an analgesic effect expressed by a decrease in the amplitude of a cortical somatosensory evoked potential in response to tooth pulp electrostimulation. Intracerebroventricular saralasin injection abolished or blocked the effect of auriculo-acupuncture stimulation at 100 Hz, but not at 15 Hz frequency. Intravenous injection of naloxone abolished the effect of auriculo-acupuncture stimulation at 15 Hz but not at 100 Hz frequency. Methysergide or D,L-p-chlorophenylalanine injection diminished but did not entirely block the effect of auriculo-acupuncture stimulation at 100 Hz. This suggests that the neuropeptide angiotensin II is a antinociceptive factor in dental peptide analgesic mechanisms induced by auriculo-acupuncture stimulation at 100 Hz frequency.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of peripheral nerve afferent for example tibial nerve by a strong electrical stimulation (rectanfular wave with 20V amplitude; pulse duration of 0.5 ms, 0.3 pulses/sec) can evoke a discharge of the somato-sympathetic reflex which is recorded on the efferent of renal sympathetic nerve. The component of the somato-sympathetic reflex can be divided into two parts: one is related to the transmission of the myelinated afferent fibers with a short lantency (41+/-2 ms) and is defined A-reflex, the other is related to the transmission of the unmyelinated afferent fibers with a long latency (210+/-13 ms) and is defined C-reflex. In the present study, an acupuncture needle (diameter 0.34 mm) was inserted into the hind limbs of the rat, dorsolaterally at the area of acupoint: huantiao (GB30), at a depth of 4-5 mm and was twisted right and left twice every second during recording the somato-renal sympathetic reflex. It was found that acupuncture on the huantiao acupoint significantly inhibited both A- and C-reflexes. There was no different inhibition of the A- and C-reflexes by acupuncture on the right or left side. However acupuncture on the fore limbs of the rat dorsolaterally at the area of acupoint: quchi (LI11) showed no effect on neither A- nor C-reflexes. These results suggest that acupuncture at the same spinal segment of the acupoint inhibits the somatorenal sympathetic reflex.",

Wistar rats were given ECS stimulation, which caused behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) convulsions. However, EA could suppress ECS-elicited convulsions (including both behavioral and EEG abnormalities). The results of RIA showed that after repeated ECS treatments, the contents of L-E-LI and Beta-E-LI increased significantly by 136% and 157%, respectively. In contrast, EA treatment depleted alterations of L-E-LI and Beta-E-LI induced by ECS, depleting L-E-LI by 32% and Beta-E-LI by 85%. These observations suggest that anticonvulsive action of EA is related to the release of L-E and Beta-E in hippocampus, probably through decreasing their release, thus to exert EA action.",

Such stimulation has further been shown to eliminate skin calcium deposits in systemic sclerosis. The present study tested the effects of TNS on clinical symptoms in peritendinitis calcarea of the shoulder and the possibility that this procedure could eliminate calcium deposits in this disease. Ten patients with 14 calcareous shoulders received TNS-treatment with a follow-up time of 3-10 months. Two of these were classified as acute, 9 as chronic, and 3 as asymptomatic. Great relief of pain and of restricted mobility was encountered in 10 of the 11 symptomatic shoulders one week or two after the onset of daily stimulation with subsequent progressive improvement of residual complaints during the following weeks. There was one relapse after 2 months' freedom of pain. Calcium deposits persisted in the 3 asymptomatic shoulders, but was completely eliminated or greatly reduced in 7 of the 11 symptomatic ones. Comparison is made with reported untreated series. Even if most shoulders with calcified peritendinitis will spontaneously improve in time, TNS-treatment shortens the period of incapacitation and discomfort, secures freedom of pain, and allows earlier mobilization. It may thus represent an alternative method to other therapeutic procedures, such as roentgen irradiation and injection of anesthetics and hydrocortisone, in this disabling disorder.",

    "abstract": "The data presented in this article was collected after reviewing clinical findings gathered from using various anxiety control methods on apprehensive patients. We examined clinical applications of the eye movement (EM) component of Eye Movement Desensitization (EMD) on fearful dental patients who have histories of traumatic dental experiences. We also used Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) to select the proper dosage of sedative to minimize the adverse side effects. For patients who did not respond well to EM, we used BDORT to select the proper sedative medication and its dosage. In certain difficult cases, we supplemented these techniques with acupuncture to augment the sedative effects. Findings were based on the clinical impressions and assessments of both the patients and the operating team. Results showed that EM, although effective in enabling patients to undergo non-invasive dental procedures such as clinical examination and simple prophylaxis, had only limited beneficial effect with invasive procedures such as extraction, drilling, and injections, etc. We also found that BDORT greatly reduced adverse side effects of sedatives such as hypertension, hypotension, hypoxia, tachycardia, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting. For most apprehensive patients, we found that EMD and acupuncture combined with BDORT predetermined dosage for the submucosal sedation enabled these patients to undergo the complete dental treatment. The authors try to explain the mechanism of BDORT and EM in terms of visual awareness (or consciousness) and preferred patterns, where neurons in the brain respond to the actions and/or direction of movement. The authors believe that BDORT and EM could have better results if the persons performing BDORT have visual awareness and are focused on the task; whereas in EM, the patient's eye on the therapist's hand movements. A more focused approach via visual pathway will result in more favorable results in EM. Likewise, performing BDORT absentmindedly could lead to false results if visual awareness (or consciousness) is absent. \"Preferred pattern\" will arouse neurons in the brain to cause conscientiousness, and performing BDORT with 'open eyes' arouse the necessary visual awareness that is necessary for the successful performance of BDORT tasks.",

Patient may discover suddenly during yawning, laughing, or when the mouth is wide open that he or she could not close the jaw. It may cause serve anxiety and apprehension, that may put the patient in such a nervous state that may worsen the condition, and also may spastically tense the muscles associated with dislocation. We treated 37 patients in the past and found that, although five patients could be manipulated to have their dislocated jaw reduced to the normal state, we found that a majority of the cases could not be manipulated without supplementing with other adjunctive methods such as acupuncture at the pertinent acupoints, or injections of local anesthetic around the temporomandibular joint area. Twenty-seven patients were successful to have the dislocation or subluxation reduced, five patients required local anesthetic for reduction and 1 patient had to have the reduction done in the operating room under deep sedation. We found acupuncture is valuable in reducing the mandibular subluxation and dislocation. Three acupoints in calming down the patients were a valuable aid during treatment. LI 4 which is known to reduce pain in head and neck region could increase pain threshold and decrease anxiety associated with discomfort encountered during reduction treatment. Additional acupoints such as P 6 (Neikuan), Ext 1 (Yintang), and H 7 (Shenmen) are valuable for the patients who are tense and nervous. Those acupoints are also could be utilizied as additional aid to ease the spasm of the muscles associated with subluxation and dislocation.

A systematic review of the literature for clinical trials was performed up to September 2008. RCTs assessing acupuncture point stimulation for patients with HBV infection were considered for inclusion. The search identified 70 relevant trials meeting the inclusion. The quality of each trial was assessed using the revised Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) statement, facilitating critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs by providing guidance to authors; the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) recommendations, acting as an extension of the CONSORT guidelines for the specific requirements of acupuncture studies; and the Jadad scale, widely used in different settings to assess methodological quality. All trials were reported \"randomization\", but only 2 mentioned the methods. None reported allocation concealment, a method used to keep clinicians and participants unaware of upcoming assignments. None reported blinding. 3 studies described the number of withdrawals/dropouts, while none used the analysis of \"intention to treat\". The reported items of the STRICTA recommendations were assigned for 65% (13 out of 20). Only 2 studies had a high quality Jadad score. The results from our work show that the quality was low caused by their methodological flaws and inadequate reports. Further rigorous clinical trials for HBV infection would be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture.",

Unfortunately, people involved in long-term intense endurance exercise (especially professional athletes) do not fully understand the cause and health risks of pathological cardiac remodeling, resulting in pathological cardiac remodeling developing into irreversible damage, which seriously affects sports careers and the postretirement life of athletes. Studies have shown that myocardial inflammation caused by long-term and repeated high-intensity exercise is a prerequisite for inducing pathological remodeling and that effective inhibition of inflammation can block or reverse the pathological process of pathological remodeling. This preliminary study showed that moxibustion at CV 8 inhibited the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases/nuclear factor-κβ (p38 MAPK/NF-κβ) signaling pathway in myocardium, reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor(TNF-α), significantly improved myocardial morphology and function in rats under going long-term and repeated high-intensity exercise, and effectively prevented pathological cardiac remodeling. Moxibustion at CV 8 provides a new physical therapy and experimental basis for the treatment of pathological cardiac remodeling in clinical practice.",

Cervical cancer of the uterus is the most well-known cancer associated with HPV-16. Among the oncogenic HPVs, types 16 and 18 are most responsible for the majority of the HPV-caused cancers. Recently, using EMF Resonance Phenomenon between 2 identical substances, we non-invasively measured HPV-16 and HPV-18 among 25 physicians and 25 dentists and found that all 50 have HPV-16 in oral cavities and oropharynx but not HPV-18. However most dentists have a stronger infection than physicians. Among them were 2 female dentists with breast cancer containing HPV-16 and strong infections of HPV-16 in the oral cavities and oropharynx. When the author checked their breast cancer positive areas as well as the mammograms of cancer positive areas, Chrysotile Asbestos co-existed with an infection of HPV-16. We then examined over 500 published mammograms of women with malignant breast cancer published by other institutes, and we found HPV-16 in more than 97% and HPV-18 in less than 3% of the breast cancer mammograms examined. Less than 0.4% of cases were found as a variety of combination of HPV-16 &amp; HPV-18. We also discovered that breast cancer with HPV-16 always co-exists with increased Chrysotile Asbestos deposits, and the outline of the breast cancer positive area is a relatively smooth and round or oval shape, and breast cancer with HPV-18 always co-exists with increased Tremolite Asbestos, where the tumor outline is an irregular saw-tooth like zigzag pattern. Based on these findings, better methods of diagnosis, treatment and prevention with a vaccine can be developed.",

Some types of HPVs cause warts, while others can lead to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx and anus. High-risk human papillomavirus (hr HPV) has been detected in almost all cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. All patients examined by colposcopy. Cervical swab is routinely done and patients are screened with both HPV DNA by Real Time Polimerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) testing and Pap testing. Pictures obtained by colposcopy were examined by indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) by using reference control substance (RCS): HPV 16, HPV 18, and Integrin α5 β1. BDORT was developed by Prof. Omura Y. of New York and received U. S. patent in 1993. For detection of HPV DNA we used RT PCR and standard Qiagen method which detect 18 types (16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,68, 6,11,42,43,44) of HPV from smear.

The meridian system is considered as basic anatomy for acupuncture, so the corresponding pathways and related syndromes of different channels should play a key role in differentiation, known as meridian-related pattern differentiation. Since this doctrine originated in ancient times and was not so well developed in later generations, many acupuncturists are not able to utilize it efficiently. The authors survey how this doctrine was weakened during the past century, especially in acupuncture education for foreigners, and how this important method is currently being reinvigorated. This article also lays out the ways this doctrine can be applied clinically and introduces examples of a variety of indications including some difficult cases, such as whiplash injury, intervertebral disc herniation, oculomotor nerve paralysis, and eczema, etc.",

The majority of nocturia patients prescribed desmopressin although it may cause significant hyponatremia which is a serious life threatening side effect. There is a need to use safer alternative treatment strategies specialy for older nocturia patients. We aim to examine the effect of acupuncture treatment on nocturia patients as a safe alternative treatment option. 35 nocturia patients have been joined to our study aged between 28 to 72. Among those patients in the study, 23 were female while 12 were male. Acupuncture treatment were applied in every 2 days totaling 10 sessions and each treatment session has lasted for 20 minutes. Nocturia frequency of the patients were recorded 1 to 6 before acupuncture treatment sessions. We have observed that nocturia symptoms recovered completely in 60% of the patients at the end of 10 sessions of the treatment while nocturia frequency were reduced to one per night in 37% of the patients. On the other hand nocturia sypmtoms in 2.8% of the patients were not changed at all. As a result 97% of the patients have responded to acupuncture treatment positively which applied bilaterally to Yintang point, Ki 3, Liv 3, Sp 9, L. I. 4, Ht 7, Sp 6, Lu 9, Sp 3, P 6 points. According to our results we conclude that acupuncture treatment should be widely used in nocturia patients of older ages as well as relatively younger adults.",

    "abstract": "External gigong emitted by a quartz crystal upon application of electric current was evaluated by its biological effects, such as changes in frequency-analyzed electroencephalograms (EEG) in rabbits and spontaneous electrical activity of the rat pineal gland. Physical properties of this external gigong cannot be evaluated by currently available physical means. Three types of EEG changes were produced depending on the intensity of current applied to the crystal. These changes corresponded fairly well to the dose-dependent EEG changes after intravenous administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan. A gigong-containing medal also produced similar EEG changes depending on threshold to gigong. Human gigong similarly influenced EEG. All EEG changes disappeared after pinealectomy or after application of methysergide (10 mg/kg), a serotonin antagonist. The rate of spontaneous electrical activity of the pineal gland was depressed by reorientation of the rat to the north or to the south, by gigong emitted by a quartz crystal, or by application of a gigong-containing medal. Human gigong also depressed this electrical activity. The EEG changes produced by external gigong might be caused by increased serotonin concentration in the pineal gland, since the pineal gland is responsive to gigong as well as the earth's magnetic field, which is known to inhibit N-acetyltransferase by increasing serotonin concentration in the pineal gland. Hence, the finding that current-intensity-dependent EEG changes induced by quartz crystal-emitted gigong were analogous to dose-dependent EEG changes produced by 5-hydroxytryptophan might be attributed to increased serotonin levels by current-intensity-dependent inhibition of N-acetyltransferase by external gigong.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that seizure induced by injecting penicillin (0.24 mg/2 microliters) into hippocampus could be inhibited by electroacupuncture (EA) probably via decreasing enkephalin content in hippocampus. To determine whether this change reflected the peptide synthesis, preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA was detected in hippocampus and some other limbic structures during seizure and after EA treatment by in situ hybridization. Four hours after injecting penicillin into hippocampus, PPE mRNA levels were significantly increased by 10 folds in entorhinal cortex, subiculum, CA1 area of hippocampus, amygdaloid nucleus and piriform cortex, whereas EA treatment apparently attenuated the seizure-induced increase of PPE mRNA in the areas mentioned above. The results indicated that EA may regulate the biosynthesis of PPE in hippocampus during seizure by an alteration in gene transcription.",

    "abstract": "Most frequently encountered causes of intractable pain and intractable medical problems, including headache, post-herpetic neuralgia, tinnitus with hearing difficulty, brachial essential hypertension, cephalic hypertension and hypotension, arrhythmia, stroke, osteo-arthritis, Minamata disease, Alzheimer's disease and neuromuscular problems, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and cancer are often found to be due to co-existence of 1) viral or bacterial infection, 2) localized microcirculatory disturbances, 3) localized deposits of heavy metals, such as lead or mercury, in affected areas of the body, 4) with or without additional harmful environmental electro-magnetic or electric fields from household electrical devices in close vicinity, which create microcirculatory disturbances and reduced acetylcholine. The main reason why medications known to be effective prove ineffective with intractable medical problems, the authors found, is that even effective medications often cannot reach these affected areas in sufficient therapeutic doses, even though the medications can reach the normal parts of the body and result in side effects when doses are excessive. These conditions are often difficult to treat or may be considered incurable in both Western and Oriental medicine. As solutions to these problems, the authors found some of the following methods can improve circulation and selectively enhance drug uptake: 1) Acupuncture, 2) Low pulse repetition rate electrical stimulation (1-2 pulses/second), 3) (+) Qi Gong energy, 4) Soft lasers using Ga-As diode laser or He-Ne gas laser, 5) Certain electro-magnetic fields or rapidly changing or moving electric or magnetic fields, 6) Heat or moxibustion, 7) Individually selected Calcium Channel Blockers, 8) Individually selected Oriental herb medicines known to reduce or eliminate circulatory disturbances. Each method has advantages and limitations and therefore the individually optimal method has to be selected. Applications of (+) Qi Gong energy stored paper or cloth every 4 hours, along with effective medications, were often found to be effective, as Qigongnized materials can often be used repeatedly, as long as they are not exposed to rapidly changing electric, magnetic or electro-magnetic fields. Application of (+) Qi Gong energy-stored paper or cloth, soft laser or changing electric field for 30-60 seconds on the area above the medulla oblongata, vertebral arteries or endocrine representation area at the tail of pancreas reduced or eliminated microcirculatory disturbances and enhanced drug uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Although more than 200 years have elapsed since the beginning of homeopathy and in spite of numerous confirmatory scientific experiments, the so-called memory of water is still a highly disputable and controversial theme in scientific circles. To make a contribution to solving this riddle, our research group tried to examine memory properties of water by the method of differential corona discharge Kirlian electrophotography of water-drop pairs. The method is based on a modified form of Kirlian photography with a subsequent thorough computer picture analysis. The potassium iodide (KI) mother solution (0.1M) was diluted in the standard way (without potentisation) or with potentisation (succussion by hand - by striking the vial 60 times against a large book as used traditionally) to 10(-3)M, 10(-6)M, 10(-10)M, 10(-16)M, 10(-17)M and 10(-24)M KI solutions. In the electrophotography method a drop of KI solution was compared with a drop of control water. To get a dependable system of results we compared homeopathic dilutions with ordinary distilled water, sham-potentised distilled water and non-potentised (standard) solutions. The results were analyzed by the Chi-square Goodness-of-fit test and the Sign test. They showed repeatable and statistically significant effects of concentration of KI dilutions as well as potentisation on the corona discharge process (from p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). This indicates that there is some physical basis of molecular (ionic) information imprinted into water.",

Anecdotal works have highlighted interesting results obtained in disk herniation with infiltration of paravertebral muscles with oxygen-ozone. To verify the existence of a nociceptive effect and investigate a possible mechanism of action, an experimental model of edema induction by subcutaneous capsaicin injection in the rat paw was employed. Oxygen-ozone, in different concentrations (10 microg/ml, 20 microg/ml and 30 microg/ml) has been injected both ipsi- and contralaterally to the paw 30 minutes before the administration of 50 microg capsaicin in 50 microl of physiological solution. Results show that the contralateral injection of the O2-O3 mixture modulates the edema response in the paw. Statistical significance, for the 20 microg/ml mixture, lasts as far as 45 minutes after administration of the capsaicin. No efficacy has been found for the 10 and 30 microg/ml concentrations. An injection of the same quantity of gas in the ipsilateral paw to the capsaicin-induced edema determines a worse edema than that observed in the control group, as if the ozone mixture added its irritative effect to that of capsaicin. It is interesting to note that the administration of oxygen alone cause a greater edema than the oxygen-ozone mixture.",

Fifteen persons practicing or having practiced cupping were interviewed in Savo Province, Eastern Finland.

No written material is nowadays available and known to be used in learning. Cupping is considered by healers to be useful in the treatment of aching and pains of teeth, head, neck, shoulders, back and legs. Cuppers report cupping effective also in hypertension and skin diseases. On the other hand, the method is not regarded to be useful in problems of internal organs. Cupping is done after a sauna and bathing of the patient in a warm environment (in sauna). It is often preceded by massage. The small wounds in the cupping sites are made with the aid of a small knife. The healers have the opinion that bad blood must be removed from the superficial areas of the ailing parts of the body, The cupping sites were more or less specific to the ailments of the patient and the number of cups varied from patient to patient depending on the condition and size.",

    "abstract": "Even in the presence of normal blood pressure (B.P.) in both arms in some individuals, abnormal B.P. and circulatory disturbances can be found in the brain and lower extremities. The author discovered the following five types of abnormal B.P. in the brain in the presence or absence of normal B.P. in the arms: unilateral cephalic hypertension; bilateral cephalic hypertension; unilateral cephalic hypotension; bilateral cephalic hypotension; mixed cephalic hypertension and hypotension. When the B.P. of the head exceeds about 160 mm Hg, patients experience sensation of increased pressure buildup in the head to moderate headache. When it exceeds over 220 mm Hg, most of them experience severe headache in that side of the head. When the B.P. is very low (less than 30 mm Hg in both sides), majority of the subjects experience sleep disturbance pattern, mainly insomnia and some develop excessive sleepiness; difficulty in concentration and easy forgetfulness of recent events; various degrees of irritability. They are often associated with injury of neck-shoulder area with the presence of spastic muscles in the area. Relaxation of the spastic muscles by acupuncture, TES or soft laser beam from He-Ne (7 approximately 15m Watts) often change the abnormal cephalic B.P. toward normal. Among individuals with cephalic hypotension some of them develop eye problems. Blind patients with macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa often have severe cephalic hypotension and reduced blood flow. Improvement of B.P. and blood flow induced by safe and effective electrical stimulation resulted in significant improvement in vision. In some patients, abnormal B.P. and blood flow of the brain are dependent on the position of the head and neck which can be classified as \"Cephalo-cervical Position Dependent Dysfunction Syndrome\" which interferes with the function of some of the internal organs. In many psychiatric patients with schizophrenia or severe depression, cephalic B.P. and blood flow are often reduced significantly with additional abnormal function of pancreas, thyroid gland or liver. These abnormalities can explain some of the abnormal behavior, particularly when hypoglycemia, decrease in serotonin level and decreased circulation in the brain coexist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Traditional concepts of classical acupuncture and Chinese medicine come from a culture which is very different from ours, and there has been considerable problems in their accurate presentation. Our approach is to attempt the development of a mathematical language that links these traditional concepts theoretically to models that can be experimentally tested. We first review some of Manaka's findings, confirmed also by our results, having to do with low intensity stimuli. In particular, Manaka applied polarized agents such as Cu(+) and Zn(-) to nonacupuncture points on a meridian and to the so called \"mother and child\" points on a meridian. In both cases he observed the pressure pain reaction which increased for one orientation of Cu and Zn on the meridian and decreased for the opposite orientation. Note that in the case of \"mother and child\" points the observed reaction was in agreement with the so called \"five phase (five element)\" theory. Also, in the case of the \"mother and child\" points the effect usually lasted considerably longer than in the case of nonacupuncture points on a meridian. Taking into account the connection between Manaka's results and skin electrical measurements by some electrodermal diagnostic instruments such as Motoyama's AMI, we discuss some equivalent electric circuits for a single meridian and relate them to the nervous system response. In particular, an electrical circuit model similar to the synapse membrane with two ionic channels seems to be especially useful when we try to explain Manaka's clinical results and Motoyama's results on the velocity of propagation of electrical impulses along meridians. We also develop a mathematical model in the form of a linear five dimensional dynamical system of the so called \"five phase (five element)\" laws such as \"creative\" cycle, \"controlling\" cycle, etc., in the case of a single meridian. We connect this model with the membrane type model mentioned above by assuming a simple mass action law, for the dependence of the conductances in the ionic channels on the input signals. This combined model is used to describe the development of a \"disease\" and its treatment according to the \"five phase\" theory. Here we interpret the \"disease\" as a blockage in a meridian, while the treatment initiates the unblocking process.",

    "abstract": "The re-introduction of acupuncture into the United States rekindled the interest in the management of chronic pain. Thermography has been shown to be a simple, non-invasive, reliable, and objective method to study pain. Our investigation included 81 patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions, one pain-free patients with left hemiparesis, and two normal subjects as controls. When pain was alleviated by acupuncture, thermography consistently demonstrated an increase of the infra-red radiation (IRR) of the affected parts of the body. Even though a patient might not report any reduction of pain, an elevation of the IRR of the affected site by acupuncture might imply the patient's denial of such an occurrence subconsciously or consciously. Acupuncture applied to pain-free patients tended to cause either no remarkable change of the infra-red pattern, or sometimes a slight decrease of the IRR if they experienced discomfort from needling. If normal thermographic patterns were observed in a patient with subjective pain, it practically excludes an actual existence of the complaint. The cooling effect of needling discomfort could be due to vasovagal over-activities. In conclusion, our investigation seemed to confirm that thermography indeed offered a simple, non-invasive, objective technique to study chronic pain and to provide an accurate measure of the effectiveness of acupuncture.",

By using in situ hybridization, we found that ppOFQ mRNA expression was decreased in the same nuclei after the administration of MEL, and further decreased following the combination of EA and MEL. The results suggested that attenuating the release and synthesis of OFQ in the brain is one of the mechanisms that melatonin promotes acupuncture analgesia.",

The feasibility of applying iTBS to the affected hemisphere for the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia was directly analyzed for the first time. ITBS combined with conventional swallowing therapy could be adopted as a rehabilitation strategy to improve post-stroke dysphagia.",

Cava,., Cavo and Cava2-61 are main component proteins of L-type calcium channel; CaM and Calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) are Ca2+ channel associated proteins. In this experiment, MI was induced by injection of isoproterenol (ISO) in rats and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded before and after every injection, and protein expressions of Cava,c, Cavp, Cava2_61, CaM and CaMKII were higher [The protein expression increased 43.39%, 54.85%, 47.08%, 48.29% and 50.36% respectively] than the control rats significantly (p<0.05). After MI induction, the MI rats were divided into three groups, including PC6 (Neiguan-point), LU7 (Lieque-point) and Non-acupuncture-point group, which were acupunctured once a day for 7 days respectively. After EA at PC6, the protein expressions showed obvious decrease [EA at PC6: the protein expressions of Cava1c, CavP, Cava2-81, CaM and CaMKII decreased 26.36%, 27.58%, 25.21%, 27.21% and 26.61% respectively.] and they are all lower than MI rats significantly (p<0.05). After EA at LU7 and Non-acupuncture-point, the protein expressions showed no significant changes. The effect of EA at PC6 was significantly better than LU7 and Non- acupuncture-point (p<0.05). PC6 is an acupoint of the pericardium meridian, and the pericardium meridian, which corresponds to opioid system according to Li P's research, can affect the cardio-vascular function directly. LU7 is located on the lung meridian; it cannot affect the heart function directly although the lung is related to the heart in blood circulation function so PC6 showed the target treating effect of meridian specificity on regulating the L-type calcium channel in MI.",

Our research was performed to develop new non-invasive, safe, quick economical method of detecting cancers and the 1st author already developed for clinically important non-invasive new methods including early stage of present method using his method of localizing accurate organ representation areas of face, eyebrows, upper lip, lower lip, surface and dorsal part of the tongue, surface backs, and palm side of the hands. This accurate localization of the organ representation area of the different parts of the body was performed using electromagnetic field resonance phenomenon between 2 identical molecules or tissues based on our US patented non-invasive method in 1993. Since year 2000, we developed the following non-invasive diagnostic methods that can be quickly identified by the patented simple non-invasive method without using expensive or bulky instrument at any office or field where there is no electricity or instrument available. The following are examples of non-invasive quick method of diagnosis and treatment of cancers using different approaches: 1) Soft red laser beam scanning of different parts of body; 2) By speaking voice; 3) Visible and invisible characteristic abnormalities on different organ representation areas of the different parts of the body, and 4) Mouth, Hand, and Foot Writings of both right and left side of the body. As a consequence of our latest research, we were able to develop a simple method of detecting cancer from existing recorded electrocardiograms. In this article, we are going to describe the method and result of clinical applications on many different cancers of different organs including lung, esophagus, breast, stomach, colon, uterus, ovary, prostate gland, as well as common bone marrow related malignancies such as Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma as well as Leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Background: One of the most commonly observed work-related musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) in university employees is low back pain (LBP). However, there is a lack of clinical studies investigating the additional effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) with exercise on unspecified chronic low back pain among university employees. Objective: To investigate the additional effects of electro-acupuncture with exercise on unspecified chronic low back pain among university employees. Methods: Through permuted two-block randomization technique, the eligible participants were randomized and allocated into the electro-acupuncture with exercise group (Group A; n=64) and exercise alone group (Group B; n=64). Group A received electro-acupuncture (EA) treatment with exercise and Group B received exercise care alone for 4 times a week for 4 weeks. Primary (pain intensity) and secondary (range of motion, functional disability, and quality of life) measures were measured at baseline, after the 4th week, 8th week, and at 6 months ' follow-up. The independent t-test and chi-square test were used to test the differences between the two groups' general characteristics. The time effect within each group was analyzed with a repeated measure ANOVA test. Results: Baseline demographic and clinical attributes show a homogenous presentation among the study groups (p&gt;0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, and at the end of 6 months follow up, the pain intensity, 2.9 (95% CI 2.78 to 3.01), range of motion ‐3.22 (95% CI ‐3.51 to -2.92), functional disability 9.0 (95% CI 8.68 to 9.31), and quality of life ‐29.3 (95% CI ‐31.6 to ‐27.1) shows significant improvement (p&lt;0.001) in Group A than Group B. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that electro-acupuncture could be an effective additional treatment in physical therapy for unspecified chronic low back pain Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that electro-acupuncture could be an effective additional treatment in physical therapy for unspecified chronic low back pain in university employees.

Methods: A total of 69 post-stroke hemiplegia patients with muscle spasm who were hospitalized in the Department of Encephalopathy Rehabilitation, Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were selected as the research participants. The randomized controlled clinical trial design method was used, and they were randomly divided into the basic treatment group and the combination treatment group. The basic treatment group did not use acupuncture treatment, but only basic rehabilitation treatment. The combination treatment group was treated with opposing needling combined with eye acupuncture therapy. Both groups were treated once a day, and two days were rested after five days of continuous treatment. Five days were a course of treatment, and a total of three courses were treated. The efficacy of opposing needling combined with eye acupuncture therapy for treatment of muscle spasm in post-stroke hemiplegia patients was evaluated. The clinical neurological deficit score scale (CSS), modified Ashworth spasticity scale (MAS), simplified Fugl-Meyer scale (FMA), Barthel index scale (BI) and total score were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Results: There was no significant difference in CSS scores between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05). After 19 days of treatment, the CSS scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in MAS scores between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05). After 19 days of treatment, the MAS scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in FMA scores between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05).

Before the treatment all the patients, and 30 healthy volunteers, made leukocytes migration tests [(in vivo, using the Rebuck method (1) as modified by Southam (2)]. It was found that patients suffering from chronic spastic bronchitis have leukocytes migration defect. This defect increases in patients who have taken corticosteroids. We have also found that after 42 acupuncture sessions the amount of leukocytes in the tissue pool comes close to the value found in healthy persons during leukocyte migration, [(tested in vivo, using the Rebuck method as modified by Southam (2)].",

The objective of present study was to investigate the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) on IL-6 mRNA expression in ischemic rat brain, by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Data showed that EA stimulation significantly upregulated IL-6 mRNA levels in rat cortex and striatum following cerebral ischmia-reperfusion (P<0.05 vs. cerebral ischemia group, respectively), but nothing for sham-EA treatment. The result suggests that EA may partially participate in the regulation of inflammatory processes, and the mechanism of neuroprotective action of EA is implicated in modulation of IL-6 gene expression in cerebral ischemic injury.",

The system is based on the use of simple questionnaires, these are formulated so that they can be used by the patients alone. An initial form is used to record basic patient data and then one of the five symptom group forms (pain, headache, indigestion, lower bowel disorder and breathlessness) is then used to evaluate the severity of any particular disease. All the questionnaires are based on similar criteria, such as drug intake, sleep disturbance due to the disease and patient's subjective evaluation of the severity of their disease. The symptom group forms are filled in by the patient at the beginning of treatment, at the end of treatment and after a three month follow-up period. The questionnaires have been piloted on some 300 patients, and have been found to be a valid and effective method of assessing treatment.",

By combining the author's \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Dysfunction Localization Method\" with clinically useful organ representation points in acupuncture medicine (where the presence of tenderness at the organ representation point is used for diagnosis as well as for the location of treatment), it has become possible to make early diagnoses of most of the internal organs, with an average diagnostic accuracy of over 85%, without knowing the patient's history or using any instruments. The method can detect dysfunctioning or diseased organs even before tenderness appears at the organ representation point, with an applied force of less than 1 gm/mm2 on the skin surface, while the detection of tenderness at the organ representation point often requires a minimum applied force of 80-100 gm/mm2. The method was applied to the \"Drug and Food Compatibility Test\" to determine the probable effects of a given food or drug on individual internal organs without going through time-consuming, expensive laboratory tests. It was also applied to auricular organ representation points and their evaluation, and has succeeded in increasing their diagnostic sensitivity. The method was also used for the evaluation of magnetic fields. Usually the North pole increased muscle strength and the South pole weakened it at most parts of the body. This simple, improved, economical diagnostic method may have invaluable implications in clinical diagnosis, treatment and drug research.

    "abstract": "Electrotherapy is a treatment method in which an electric stimulus is used to achieve physiological changes in the body. When increasing the level of the electric stimulus, three sensory, three motor and a pain response can be found. In this paper the three sensory threshold levels (1st just noticeable weak tingling sensation, 2nd a very fine but definite tingling and 3rd moderate strong tingling) were studied with an interferential electric current stimulus. The interferential electric current can be achieved by summing two alternating currents with little different frequencies with each other. As a current source, the study used a value intended for interferential electric current therapy. The threshold value measurements were performed on 5 days to 6 volunteers. The method of limits is a frequently used technique for determining sensory thresholds where ascending or descending stimuli is used and the observer reports of the appearance or disappearance of the sensation, respectively. A Bekesy's algorithm is a threshold tracking method with a variable stimulus. They were used for controlling the interferential electric current stimulus, and hence, for studying the,thresholds. By using the method of limits, the measurements were done at three sensory threshold levels at interferential frequencies deltaf of 10 Hz, 30 Hz, 50 Hz, and 100 Hz caused by two sine waves, one with a frequency between 2490 Hz and 2400 Hz, and the other constant 2500 Hz. In the method based on Bekésy's algorithm the interferential frequency deltaf was increased from 1 Hz to 100 Hz by changing the first frequency from 2499 Hz to 2400 Hz and the measurement was repeated for all three sensory thresholds. The sensory thresholds for interferential current stimuli seem to be quite unaffected by the interferential electric current frequency among the healthy test persons, and no distinct interferential electric current frequencies at which the threshold values should be measured were found in this study.",

The proposed WNT model involves a needle, needle handle and the calf section around the GB38 acupoint. For validating the numerical results, measurement using the calibrated infrared (IR) camera was also conducted. Our aim was to calculate the skin surface temperature and the temperatures under warm needle at different depths beneath the skin. From the temperature profile along the centerline of the acupuncture needle, the temperature is seen to decrease rapidly from the burning moxa section (200 degrees C) to the skin surface (36 degrees C). The temperature near the needle (36 degrees C) is only 1 degrees C higher than those predicted at other places (approximately 35 degrees C). This phenomenon explains why this treatment practice is called the warm needle rather than the hot needle treatment.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder with increasing global prevalence. It is characterized by impaired glucose utilization that leads to chronic hyperglycemia which is a result of the body's inability to produce insulin (diabetes type I) or inability to make use of insulin (diabetes type II). Long-term hyperglycemia can cause damage to multiple systems, and microvascular and macrovascular complications lead to myocardial infarction, blindness, stroke and renal failure. Diabetes affected 382 million people globally in 2013, and it is estimated to rise up to 592 million by 2035. In spite of its management, both microvascular and macrovascular complications partly linked to oxidative stress are not efficiently prevented. Glibenclamide was approved on the U. S. market for treatment of diabetes type II in 1984. ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) are widely distributed and present in a number of tissues including muscle, pancreatic beta cells and the brain. Glibenclamide closed KATP channels, which leads to depolarization of the cells and insulin secretion. Acupuncture is also a very significant therapeutic method in the complementary medicine. ST36 (Zusanli), CV4 (Guanyuan) and CV12 (Zhongwan) are several acupoints that have been used for treatment of diabetes. In this study for evaluating the effects of glibenclamide and electroacupuncture, 3 parameters such as malondialdehyde, ferric reducing antioxidant power and thiol will be measured. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the organic compound and it is a marker for oxidative stress. Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, thereby leading to chain reactions that may damage the cells of organisms. Antioxidants such as FRAP and thiol are useful parameters of assessment of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Electroacupuncture (EA) plus glibenclamide (G) as a novel therapy on diabetic rats and maybe for human. Fifty-four male Wistar rats were randomly divided to 9 groups: 1 non-diabetic control group and 8 diabetic groups (1 sham control group and 7 experimental groups; D/G 2.5 mg/kg, D/G 5 mg/kg, D/G 10 mg/kg, EA, D/EA/G 2.5 mg/kg, D/EA/G 5 mg/kg, and D/EA/G 10 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin with high-fat diet. At the end of course, blood samples were obtained. Combination therapy of EA and glibenclamide 5 mg/kg decreased blood glucose better than single therapies (p&lt;0.05) and showed 41 percent decrease in blood glucose as compared to D/G 5 mg/kg group. Combination of EA and glibenclamide 10 mg/kg showed the best effect for decreasing the malondialdehyde level (p&lt;0.05) and also showed 43 percent decrease in comparison to D/G 10 mg/kg group. Combination of glibenclamide 2.5 mg/kg and EA increased the FRAP level better than other treatment groups (P&lt;0.001) andachieved the ferric reducing antioxidant power level near to normal range. Combination of glibenclamide 10 mg/kg with EA increased the thiol concentration better than other treatment groups (P&lt;0.001) and showed 4 percent increase in thiol concentration as compared to D/G 10 mg/kg group. These findings suggest that EA potentiates the effect of glibenclamide to protect animal model and maybe human against oxidative stress and damage.",

We now have far more knowledge about the importance of the basic system. Furthermore, we know that the theories on chaos research, and, especially the fractals play an important role. Various ways of treating pain by means of acupuncture will be discussed: e.g. body acupuncture (with or without supportive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation); treatment via the so-called somatotopies (ear, oral mucous membrane, scalp acupuncture according to Yamamoto etc.). The Ludwig Boltzmann Acupuncture Institute, in close collaboration with the II. Dept. of Internal Medicine at the Kaiserin-Elisabeth Hospital, Vienna, has been able to demonstrate on inpatients with a variety of conditions, that acupuncture could significantly reduce the quantity of analgesics required.",

As results, Mao - to induced an increase of BP,HR,SV,CO and CI, but a decrease of TPR. Keishi - to induced an increase of SBP and SV, and Shimotsu-to induced an increase of DBP and MBP, HR was slowed during former period after oral administration of Shigyaku - san, and later period after oral administration of Shimbu-to and Shimotsu-to. Regarding autonomic activity, Mao-to(former period of experiment ), Shimbu - to and Shimotsu-to induced supression of sympathetic activity, on the other hand, Mao-to (later period of experiment ) and Shiyaku - san showed a tendency of parasympathomimetic action. Mao -to induced the strongest activation of circulatory system of 6 main farmulations, and showed change of autonomic nervous activity, however, the change of circulatory and automonic nervous activity were not coincident each other. It was speculated that comprehensive mechanism of Mao-to were not only dependent of ephedrin, main active constituent of Mao, but also dependent on Keishi's vasodilatory action in it. Ninjin -to showed no actions on circulatory or autonomic system. This is indicated that there are difference of actions on circulatory and autonomic nervous system among 6 main Kampo fromulations.",

    "abstract": "External bacterial otitis is a very frequent dog's recurrent complaint and should be useful for studying acupuncture effects in infectious disease. Conventional treatment based on antibiotics, washes and bactericidal ointments, solves most cases within 1 to 6 weeks. To establish if the well known effect of this conventional treatment could be modified by acupuncture as additional treatment, a comparative randomized placebo controlled study was performed. From a sample of 25 dogs, two groups were selected at random. In addition to a conventional treatment, each group also received real acupuncture or placebo acupuncture. A veterinarian M.D. and the animal's owner evaluated at blind, through a Visual Analogous Scale, (VAS) the clinical signs and symptoms of otitis. The results show a significant difference in the complete recovery time (p < 0.01); in the disappearance period of the pain (p < 0.01) in the disappearance period of the secretion (p < 0.001) and in the animal's owner evaluation of symptoms (p < 0.001) by 6th. day of treatment. These results suggest that acupuncture stimulates animal defensive systems increasing the conventional treatment effect, which seems to work mainly against the invading agent while acupuncture seems to act by reinforcing the host's defensive barriers. Combination of both shows a synergistic effect capable of empowering the anti-infectious therapy. A three months follow-up revealed all animals were without symptoms. Further evaluation of both groups after a one year follow up will allow us to establish if relapse incidence is also modified by acupuncture, and the potential usefulness of this complementary treatment on recurrent infectious pathology.",

    "abstract": "The midday-midnight law is a well-known empirical law in Oriental medicine stating that the circadian rhythm of internal organs influences their paired organs according to the time of day. However, there has been little research to test the purported relationship between the time of day and organ function. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate whether the midday-midnight law applies to the meridian activity and the electrical conduction properties of the acupuncture points. We used the digital readout instrument (MERIDIAN) to measure electrical conduction properties at 12 acupuncture points corresponding to the 12 meridians at four times: 12:00, 14:00, 22:00, and 24:00 hours. There were no significant differences in the electrical current values measured at the four times in any meridian. However, the mean current values of 12 acupuncture points changed significantly over time (P < 0.0001). The mean current values were significantly higher at 14:00 (P < 0.001), 22:00, and 24:00 hours (P < 0.001) than at 12:00 hours. The highest current value occurred at 22:00 hours and was significantly higher than 24:00 hours (P < 0.05). Although these do not conclusively support the traditional midday-midnight theory, our data suggest the existence of some type of daily variability in electrical current.",

A 2-4 minute interval of highly beneficial phase during sunrise and sunset which is comparable or is stronger than (+) Qigong Energy was detected. This energy was stored on 3 x 5 inch index cards. The sun energy stored on the exposed surface had a Bi-Digital O-Ring Test extremely strong positive (+) response, and the opposite side of the index card which was not exposed to the sun showed an equally strong negative (-) response. When the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test strong positive side (+) was applied to the patient's skin above various intractable painful areas with circulatory disturbances, including gangrenous pain, muscle pain, joint pain, & migraine headache, most of the pain disappeared or was significantly reduced within between 10 seconds and 5 minutes, with accelerated wound healing compared with Qigong energy stored paper of the same exposure, which caused pain to disappear within between 1.5 minutes and 15 minutes. When this Special Solar Energy Stored Paper was applied either directly to the skin above cancer positive areas or the midline of the upper chest above the thymus gland representation area, or the occipital area above the medulla oblongata, various cancer related parameters returned to close to normal values, with immediate clinical improvement. The beneficial effects of 10-60 seconds of application of the Special Solar Energy Stored Paper lasted for between 7 and 40 days, depending on the individual and their environmental electromagnetic field, how the special solar energy was stored, and how it was applied to the patient.",

Our previous studies demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) modulated the SO motility in cats and rabbits through activation of nonadrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) pathway. This study was designed to investigate the changes of neurotransmitters such as CCK and VIP in lower biliary tract in cats receiving EA stimulation. After cats were anesthetized with intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride, they were prepared to conduct EA stimulation on right Qimen (LR14) and Riyue (GB 24). The parameters of EA were 6 pulses/ 3 sec and 45 pulses/ 3 sec alternatively in frequency, 1-2 mA in intensity and 20 min in stimulation duration. After the completeness of EA stimulation, visceral organs such as gallbladder, duodenum and the sphincter of Oddi were removed and frozen for immunohistochemistry localization of CCK and VIP. The results showed that the distribution of CCK-labeled cells in duodenum, gallbladder and SO were more and distinct after EA than before EA stimulation. Whereas, the VIP-labeled cells were significantly more and distinct in duodenum and SO, but not in gall bladder. We conclude that EA regulates the biliary motility though increasing the distribution of CCK- and VIP-containing cells in duodenum and the sphincter of Oddi.",

The therapeutic effect of different colors of light or different sounds is explained as a harmonic frequency resonance to the frequency of the wave running along each meridian; it is also the basis of the quantum ways for diagnosis and drug testing called Bi-Digital O-ring test. The homeopathic remedies also heal as waves through the frequencies of the substance imprinted on the water structure (the substance doesn't need to be present). The classical pulse diagnosis (used with acupuncture for early detection of diseases) is explained as detection of the amplitudes of the waves running along the acupuncture meridians, which reflect the waves' phase changes (delays or speed up).",

TEAS combines the benefits of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and acupuncture, and it is welcomed by clinicians because of its safety and significant treatment effect. For instance, TEAS is helpful for sedation and analgesia, promotes gastrointestinal function recovery, reduces the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and other adverse reactions, enhances immune function, protects organ function, accelerates the recovery of patients, improves the prognosis, and enhances patients' comfort degree. On this basis, more functions of TEAS need to be explored, and its clinical applications need to be further promoted.",

Electrical stimulation by 20 pulses/sec for 20 min. induced an elevation of plasma GH; however, no changes were found in the plasma level of ACTH at 20 min. after the needle removal. The mechanism of action of electroacupuncture in inducing GH secretion may involve the brain endorphin, serotoninergic and catecholaminergic systems. The results obtained from the determination of ACTH suggest the conclusion that electroacupuncture did not induce stress and the increased level of GH may be due to specific effects of electrical stimulation on the neuroendocrine processes.",

    "abstract": "The author hypothesizes that the mechanism of the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification and Localization Method\" is due to an electro-magnetic wave resonance phenomenon between two identical substances having an identical resonance frequency and separated by a known distance. Such a hypothesis was tested and proved by using two identical sets of electro-magnetic resonance circuits, each consisting of a fixed inductance (L) and variable capacitance (C), in place of two identical substances or molecules. When one of the resonance circuits was connected or placed close to the body surface and when the frequency of the other resonance circuit was made identical to the one placed next to the body, a maximal weakening response of the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" was observed only when the axes of the coils of the two separate sets of resonance circuits were oriented perpendicular to each other; when the axes of the coils of the two separate sets of resonance circuits were oriented parallel to each other, no \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" weakening response was observed, even when both resonance circuits had an identical resonance frequency. The information about the molecular structure and quantity of any molecule is contained in the specific electro-magnetic field emitted by the particular molecule. These electro-magnetic waves, containing information about the particular substance, can be propagated through a metal wire, through a \"concentrated electro-magnetic field projector,\" or through a light beam with wavelength longer than green color (particularly a monochromatic, collimated light beam or soft laser beam). In the cases in which a light beam is used, the monochromatic light beam (including laser beam) acts as a very high frequency carrier of the electro-magnetic waves emitted from a particular substance placed near the source of the light beam or near the end of the light beam, and information on the molecular structure and amount of the substance is carried by the light beam (including laser beam) in both forward and backward directions (bi-directional propagation of information). Even reflected light from any molecule or substance in the visual field that reaches the eyes carries information on the substance to the eye ground, particularly when the individual is gazing at the substance; simultaneously, information on a substance not normally existing in the body that happens to be in the body is sent out from the eye ground in electro-magnetic waves to the object being gazed at by the individual.",

When the Naloxone plus electro-acupuncture were used together, it was not reduced but was still lower than it was when only electro-acupuncture was used. This explained why Naloxone could reverse the function by which electro-acupuncture promoted the T-lymphocyte transformation, and the endogenous opioid in the brain promoted the immune reaction. Through promoting the release of the endogenous opioid in the brain, electro-acupuncture raised the T-lymphocyte transformation function. Using electro-acupuncture when naloxone antagonized morphine, the T-lymphocyte transformation function was still promoted markedly. The mechanism could be that electro-acupuncture excited the function of the endogenous opioid system in the brain. In acupuncture immune reaction, the relationship between the endogenous opioid and catecholaminergic systems was explored.",

Using the \"Bi-Digital O-ring Test,\" it was possible to demonstrate that, among bacterial and viral infections, the most common cause of infection associated with the appearance of hypertension is chlamydia, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus. Particularly chlamydia and/or herpes simplex virus, with or without coexistence of other microbes, is usually present at the heart representation area of the medulla oblongata, especially at the left ventricular representation area, often accompanied by upper respiratory infection, cephalic, cervical or facial pain, with or without coexisting genito-urinary infection. The left ventricular representation area of the medulla oblongata is usually located at the right side. In most hypertensive patients, the left ventricular representation area of the medulla oblongata is enlarged up to 3 or 4 times normal size. Sufficient antibiotic treatment of chlamydia with erythromycin sometimes eliminated severe hypertension which appeared after chlamydia infection. In the presence of viral infections, such as herpes simplex, which is also causing severe pain in the head or neck, oral administration of acyclovir, erythromycin, or EPA (Eicosa Pentaenoic acid)-DHA (docosa hexaenoic acid) Omega 3 fish oil often reduced associated intractable pain and hypertension toward the normal level. Thus, the author is proposing new possible mechanisms as among the causes of so-called essential hypertension as a result of microbial infection or trauma of the cardiovascular representation area, particularly that of the left ventricular representation area at the right side of the medulla oblongata.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes are composed of long arrays of (TTAGGG)n x (CCCTAA)n that form a nucleoprotein complex required for the replication and protection of chromosome ends. Throughout the cell cycle, telomeres also contain a protein component related to the proto-oncogene Myb that is known as TRF1 (telomere TTAGGG repeat binding factor 1) that binds to the duplex array of TTAGGG repeats in the telomere. Previous studies have shown that TRF1 appears to play a role in controlling the length of telomeres by acting as an inhibitor of telomerase. The amount of each of the TRF1(C-19) & TRF1(N-19) was identical to the amount of telomere of the same organ of the same apparently normal individual. Using synthesized basic unit of TTAGGG, as well as CCCTAA, as separate reference control substances for the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test of Resonance Phenomenon between 2 identical substances, we were able to non-invasively measure the approximate amount of TTAGGG and CCCTAA units, in both normal and cancerous human cells. We examined about 30 apparently normal subjects (both Asian and Caucasian in both sex). The subjects' ages ranged from infancy to 76 years. Each subject was first examined using TTAGGG as a control substance and then examined using CCCTAA as a control substance. The amount of telomere in various cancer tissues are almost always higher than that of normal tissue of the same organ. The measured amounts of both TTAGGG and CCCTAA were found to be in an average of 1500-1600 ng for human fetus or infancy and decreased with the advance of age in both sex with the exception of the heart, brain, eyes (retina), testes, and ovaries, which usually remain at the level of the infant, or reduced very little. Individuals in the same age group had a similar range of amounts of both TTAGGG and CCCTAA in the same organ of the same individual, (except for those with unusually low telomeres often had chronic degenerative diseases, and those who had exceptionally high telomere levels often had excellent physical conditions or mental acumen). The amounts of measured TTAGGG and CCCTAA molecules before and after acupuncture on St. 36 in adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinoma coexisting in the lung of a 54-yr.-old Asian male were: telomere in adenocarcinoma decreased from 950 ng to 750 ng and telomere in small cell carcinoma decreased from 770 ng to 600 ng. When the cancer treatment is effective, the amount of telomere is reduced towards the value of the normal internal organ. We found that acupuncture on St.36 on apparently normal subjects increased the telomere levels up to a maximum of more than 2 times their telomere levels prior to the treatment, depending on the method of treatment, but frequently increases were between 60% to 100%. Strong Shiatsu performed on St. 36 produced a somewhat lesser effect than acupuncture. We also determined the amounts of TTAGGG and CCCTAA molecules non-invasively in 3 mummified Egyptian sisters from the 8th Century BC on exhibit at the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy in order to estimate their approximate ages (at the time of death). The amounts of body telomere were 500 ng, 550 ng, and 750 ng. For the prehistoric Iceman (about 3350 B.C. to 3310 B.C) discovered in 1991 in the Italian Otzal Alps at about 3,200 meters altitude, estimated body telomere was about 400 ng and telomere in brain and heart was 1600 ng, similar to that of a contemporary human being. Although these studies are preliminary, the findings may have potential applications not only in anti-aging, cancer treatments, and pathophysiology of brain and heart, but also for the estimation of the difference in the ages of cadavers studied in archeology and forensic medicine.",

Applied cranially, either continuous stimulation or administration of intermittent current (5 minutes on and off) were equally effective in reducing narcosis. A decreased period of 30 minutes' continuous stimulation will reduce sleeping time only if administered immediately after LRR.

The appearance of white hairs at specific organ representation areas of eyebrows represent an abnormal condition of the specific internal organ if the BDORT grading is (-)4 or a higher negative value. When one of these white hairs on the eyebrows is examined at any location along its entire length by the BDORT, if the grading is a very abnormal negative value of (-)6 or a higher (-) value, significantly abnormal conditions exist or existed at the corresponding time at the specific location of the hair. The heart representation area on the eyebrow is located nearest to the bridge of the nose on each side, where abnormally increased BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) and cardiac Troponin I content is detected on the part of the white hair where the BDORT grading is (-)6 or a higher negative value. In the very abnormal part of the white hair representing the heart, Asbestos, TXB2, and PLGF (Placental Growth Factor) are markedly increased, while DHEA is markedly reduced. If Integrin alpha5beta1 and Oncogene C-fos Ab2 are more than 5-10 ng (BDORT units), malignancy can be suspected. When one optimal dose of DHEA, 8.5 mg, was taken once, normal body tissue telomere was increased from less than 1 ng (during which time the patient experienced extreme tiredness and frequent urination), to 525 ng (BDORT units), not only did severe tiredness & frequent urination completely disappear, but also the white hair representing the left ventricle changed to black hair, and the semi-transparent white hair representing the kidney changed to a non-transparent white hair, with significant decreases in the abnormal parameters. Thus, it is possible to detect unrecognized serious heart conditions or early-stage cancer that are currently present or that were present in the recent past by examining the white hairs of the eyebrows, and these diseases can be improved by one optimal dose of DHEA or Astragalus.",

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) causes functional limitation in weight-bearing actlVltles including walking. To investigate the multimodal impact of acupuncture, exercise therapy, and concurrent functional electrical stimulation (FES) on knee osteoarthritis. We designed a multidisciplinary treatment package including acupuncture; home based exercise therapy, and concurrent functional electrical stimulation during treadmill walking. Outcomes measurements included the numerical rating scale (NRS), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). Measurements were completed at baseline and following the treatment phase which consisted of six individual sessions. A 48-year-old male, office worker presented with a history of chronic right knee. During the previous year, he was diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis after clinical physical examination by a sports medicine physician. Following our novel training intervention, the patient reported a reduction in pain intensity from 8 to 2 on the NRS, improved in all KOOS subscale scores, and improved in the TSK scale (reduction from 15 to 11). In addition, the patient reported that he was able to return to work and undertake normal activities of daily living with reduced knee pain. This case report showed that our novel multimodal intervention including six sessions of acupuncture, exercise therapy, and treadmill walking with functional electrical stimulation (FES) had a positive impact on knee pain and function in a middle-aged male with knee osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Direct stimulation of the Nucleus Raphe Dorsalis (NRD) appears to be very effective for obtaining analgesia. However, the possible role of the NRD in analgesia by peripheral stimulation, e.g. electro-acupuncture or Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), has received less attention. Most studies indicate that in particular the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, the nucleus raphe magnus, the nucleus reticularis magnocellularis, the locus coeruleus, and the periaqueductal grey may participate in the supraspinal mechanism for the antinociceptive effect of peripheral stimulation. This paper is meant to present some theoretical considerations about the role of the NRD might play in analgesia by peripheral stimulation. Little direct evidence suggests that the NRD/serotonergic system might contribute to this type of analgesia. The analgesic role of specifically the serotonergic neurons of the NRD in peripheral stimulation could be supported by indirect evidence. From studies concerning direct stimulation of the NRD, two other mechanisms by which peripheral stimulation might exert antinociceptive effects through the NRD have been hypothesized. Stimulation-parameters affecting the effectiveness of peripheral NRD stimulation will be discussed.",

The mechanism by which acupuncture promotes the T-lymphocyte transformation function may be principally by promoting the anabolism of the T-lymphocyte and speeding up the anabolism of the DNA. Judging from the fact that acupuncture increases the positive rate of ANAE, it can be assumed that the quantity of T-lymphocyte was increased markedly. It remains to be clarified what links exist through which the central catecholaminergic neurons can influence the acupuncture induced immunity, and what the effect of other transmitter neurons of the central nervous system are on acupuncture induced immunity.",

Such currents were detected when needles were differentially heated and these currents were found to be in the range capable of producing biological effects. The traditional design of acupuncture needles and traditional needle manipulations seem to maintain a temperature gradient across the needle and thus enhance the Seebeck effect.",

    "abstract": "Functional isomorphism holds between four essential properties of acupuncture and of meditation, namely, 1) alpha rhythm prominent in electro-encephalograms (EEG); 2) deep general relaxation; 3) high degree of unresponsiveness to ordinarily painful stimuli; 4) participation of virtually the entire body. It is postulated, subject to experimental test, that a \"stillness\" prevails during acupuncture similar to the quiet of meditation. The quiet of meditation and by postulate, the \"stillness\" of acupuncture, provide high degree of unresponsiveness to aversive components of conditioned stimuli which had habitually reactivated affective trauma. This marked unresponsiveness accounts for the \"stillness\" and its EEG alpha rhythm. With its low noise level the \"stillness\" also provides the cerebral cortex better resolved, more intense signals relative to background and more comprehensive, clear information. The cortex can then call upon newly mobilizable, more precise regulation for removing imbalances throughout the body. The same factors apply to the therapy by acupuncture of phantom limb pain syndrome if the pain impulses from the limb, while attached, is the unconditioned stimulus of a reflex in which impulses from inner organs function as conditioned stimuli. Successful therapy of the syndrome using laser-stimulated acupuncture points is discussed accordingly. Emphasized is the desirability to maximize the \"stillness,\" possibly by monitoring the course of therapy by displayed EEG.",

    "abstract": "Diagnoses of bone marrow associated malignancies such as Acute &amp; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute &amp; Chronic Myelogenous (Myeloid) Leukemia, Hodgkin's Lymphoma &amp; Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma are often missed without a blood test. However, in 2008, Omura Y reported several newly discovered organ representation areas that exist between the lower end of the eyebrows and upper end of the upper eyelid. This space was divided into 5 organ representation areas. The first space (more than 1/4 of entire space) near the side of the face (temple) is the bone marrow representation area (BMRA). Therefore, we examined the bone marrow representation areas non-invasively using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT). When the small rectangular shaped part of the BMRA is strong negative (-) with more than -2, often there is a malignancy associated with bone marrow. In this area, we found 1) Integrin a5∼1 &amp; Oncogen C-fos Ab2 increased very significantly between 125∼300 ng BDORT units; 2) very high Chrysotile Asbestos (0.11∼0.14 mg); 3) markedly reduced Acetylcholine ofless than 1 ng; 4) significantly reduced telomere ofless than 1 yg (=10 -24 g); and 5) Increased 8-0H-dG (often more than 5 ng). Once the abnormal small rectangular area is localized by BDORT, by detecting the specific microscope slide which produces EMF (electromagnetic field) resonance, one can diagnose these malignancies non-invasively in about 10 minutes. When a subject has anyone of the above 7 types of bone marrow associated malignancies, the 5 aforementioned abnormal parameters can be detected. When Acetylcholine is markedly reduced to 0.25 ng or less, 8-0H-dG is 10 ng or higher, and Sirtuin 1 (one of the 7 mammalian longevity genes products) in both the Hippocampus and the body is 0.025 pg or less, most of the patients have a very poor prognosis. However, we found that increasing normal cell telomere &amp; longevity gene product Sirtuin 1 can often improve both pathology &amp; prognosis. All measurements are in BDORT units (the weight required to produce maximum EMF resonance).",

    "abstract": "Ketamine, besides being an anesthetic agent, is also a strong analgesic that can be especially useful for painful procedures. Vivid dreams and nightmare, considered as undesirable side effects of ketamine, are rarely encountered when administrated orally, making it one of the most desirable oral sedative for children because it partially protects the pharyngeal-laryngeal reflex. Besides, if used in recommended dosage, it does not suppress the cardiopulmonary function as most other sedatives do. Ketamine's bronchodilator effect makes it a good sedative for children with asthma, allergies, and hay fever. Alternating bi-lateral stimulation (ABLS) of eye movement desensitization, applying pre-operatively before ketamine was found to reduce the post-operative violent emergence and behavioral problems. Acupressure at P 6 (Neikuan) acupoint helps to decrease nausea and vomiting episodes by ketamine. 36 patients with history of unmanageable behavior were sedated with ketamine 3mg/kg and ABLS. To prevent possible adverse reaction, Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) were used to test all patients. ABLS significantly decreased tearful separation from parent. It took 15 to 20 minutes for ketamine to take effect, peak effect took 20 to 25 minutes. Working time ranged from 20 to 40 minutes. Post-operative recovery was more pleasant when ABLS was combined with ketamine, acupuncture/acupressure not only prevented vomiting and BDORT safeguard the patients from unpredictable untoward side effects but also promoting calmness.",

    "abstract": "Treating apprehensive debilitated patients (i.e. geriatric patients, patients with cardiac, pulmonary, kidney, or liver diseases, and those with other severe systemic conditions) for dental procedures can cause unexpected medical complications such as cardiac arrest, stroke, asthma or shock, etc. Due to diminishing functional capacities of their organs, sedating those patients with sedative drugs in normal regular dosage could increase the risk of adverse events for this group of patients and can also increase the risk of liability for the clinician. The authors treated 34 apprehensive dental patients with a combination technique using parenteral sedation and hypnosis together with acupuncture. We used Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) to select the compatible sedative drugs and to individualize the dosage suitable to the patient's medical condition. Oftentimes, BDORT predetermined dosage amounts to a fraction of regular dosage that is normally recommended by manufacturer for regular healthy patients. Such a reduced dosage, though benign to patient, may be insufficient to render a patient to the sedation level for dental treatment. Nevertheless, hypnosis with acupuncture can be applied to potentiate the therapeutic effect of parenteral sedation, thereby reducing the amount of sedative agents required to alleviate patient anxiety. The results indicated that hypnosis with acupuncture and BDORT could effectively allow the reduction of the sedative dosage and may beneficially provide a safe and comfortable situation for the debilitated patients to receive the necessary treatment.",

The C-fos immunoreactive labelled neurons disappeared two weeks later following ovariotomy. The rat, recovering for two weeks after ovariotomy, received EA, and many specific Fos labelled cell were observed in LPN, PVNH, VNH, SCN and especially in AR, PANH and MPN, but not any labelled neuron could be found in MAN. No obvious C-fos expression was shown in these areas in the control group and EA group without ovariotomy.

    "abstract": "The first comprehensive listing of cardiovascular risk factors was presented in this journal in 1982 in the article, \"96 Cardiovascular Risk Factors\" (by Y. Omura & S. Heller), which was the most extensive list of cardiovascular risk factors written on the subject at that time. Since then, much research has been carried out to identify cardiovascular risk factors; according to the authors' most recent computer search, close to 9,000 articles appeared between 1982 and 1996. Upon initial review of most of the abstracts of these articles, we were surprised to find that the number of cardiovascular risk factors has increased significantly (79 new factors in addition to those we published in 1982). With a few exceptions (7 risk factors are now considered to be questionable), those we listed in 1982 are still valid today, and have been further confirmed with additional data and improved technology. Through reviewing the abstracts of these articles, we found about 177 cardiovascular risk factors, including most of the 96 previously listed. Of the original 96, we have identified those now considered to be questionable, e.g. taking oral contraceptives, which today contain significantly lower doses of estrogen than in the past and are therefore much safer. All 177 cardiovascular risk factors are classified into the following 10 major categories, with the 11th category listing those factors now considered to be questionable: 1) Nutrition-Related Cardiovascular Risk Factors (33 risk factors) 2) Internal Cardiovascular Risk Factors Identifiable by Laboratory Tests: Abnormal Blood & Tissue Chemistry Findings Related to Cardiovascular Diseases (35 risk factors) 3) Drug, Chemical, Hormonal, and Nutritional Supplement Intake (Including Drug-Drug Interaction and Drug-Food Interaction) As Cardiovascular Risk Factors (34 risk factors) 4) Signs and Symptoms Associated With a High Incidence of Cardiovascular Diseases (33 risk factors) 5) Non-Invasively Detectable Abnormal Laboratory Findings Associated With Cardiovascular Diseases (13 risk factors) 6) Hereditary Cardiovascular Risk Factors (5 risk factors) 7) Environmental Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Including Air Pollution, Electromagnetic Fields, Materials that Contact the Body Surface, Poisonous Venoms, and Insertion of Needle into Infected Body Tissue by Acupuncture of Injection (14 risk factors) 8) Socioeconomic and Demographic Cardiovascular Risk Factors (7 risk factors) 9) Cardiovascular Risk Factors Related to Medical Care (2 risk factors) 10) Co-existence of Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors (1 risk factor) 11) Factors Previously Regarded As Cardiovascular Risk Factors, But Now in Question (7 risk factors) While a few factors, like hereditary characteristics, age, and sex, generally cannot be changed, most of the cardiovascular risk factors can be controlled by changing one's lifestyle, maintaining proper dietary intake, and correcting any existing abnormalities once each individual's unique constellation of cardiovascular risk factors is recognized. Some factors can be recognized by individuals themselves, but many other factors require physical examinations and laboratory tests by a physician or properly trained paramedical to be recognized. Medical examinations and blood chemistry and other laboratory tests may be necessary to establish baselines and measure changes over time. Once abnormal parameters are identified, periodic examinations should follow with proper corrective measures monitored by a qualified medical professional.",

    "abstract": "Contrary to the present practice of measurement of cardio-vascular risk factors or inflammatory risk factors such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP) from a blood sample from the vein of one arm, by using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Resonance Phenomena between 2 identical substances, one can non-invasively detect the approximate location on the body of abnormally increased risk factors in just 2 minutes, by detecting the resonance with L-Homocystine, even when blood CRP failed to detect any abnormality. This is performed by projecting a 0.5 to approximately 5mW red spectral laser beam with 560-670nm wavelength, to at least 6 standard parts of the body, when one of the control risk markers placed next to the laser beam also exists in the part of the body tested. It is generally believed that CRP is increased in the presence of acute myocardial infarct, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, metabolic abnormalities such as often detected in diabetes, inflammation and underlying infection of the cardio-vascular system, and in some cancers. However, in our study, when the clinical significance of CRP and L-Homocystine was compared, we found that CRP often was not increased when there was extensive infection of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis as well as asymptomatic infection by Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus Type I, Human Herpes Virus Type 6, Borrelia Burgdorferi, or Chlamydia Trachomatis in the heart (and other parts of the body), particularly when there was liver cell dysfunction such as an increase in ALT. In contrast, L-Homocystine was often increased in the presence of localized infections of the heart and other parts of the body. For screening of Cardio-Vascular diseases by this method, 0.5mg of L-Homocystine as a control marker was found to be the most sensitive and reliable, compared with most effective amount of CRP, 0.5ng, for detecting early Cardio-Vascular problems due to various localized infections. About 0.5ng of cardiac Troponin T and cardiac Troponin I were also useful for detecting early stages of heart disease but they are not as sensitive as L-Homocystine. Once the pathogenic factors were identified, the effective medication was given, and the Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method (originally discovered by the first author in 1990) was applied after the effective drug was administered, to selectively deliver the medication to the pathological area, while reducing drug uptake to the normal parts of the body. As a result, the therapeutic effect was markedly accelerated.",

Research in Sports Psychology can use the classical measurement methods and Bi-Digital O-Ring Test method comparatively and thus produce new findings regarding the reliability and certainty of the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test test. It seems probable that by using the non-invasive Bi-Digital O-Ring Test test, it is possible to measure enzymes, hormones and neuro-transmitters instantaneously and assess a sports person's actual psychological and physiological performance, and thereby help them reach their peak performance levels during both exercise and competitions.",

    "abstract": "PET Scans are most often used for detecting cancer and other malignant tumors because for most of them, glucose uptake is higher than in normal tissues. However, in mesothelioma, our study showed excessive deposits of Asbestos of 0.5 mg BDORT units, and markedly reduced Glucose uptake of less than 1/30 of normal tissue. As a consequence, the authors found that, in the location where there is a mesothelioma, distinctive dark black areas much darker than any normal tissue appear in the PET Scan. Therefore, a PET Scan taken parallel to the front & back of the chest wall often shows pitch-black areas on the chest wall of the patient, located on the ribs in the case of large black areas and between the ribs in the case of small black areas. If the amount of Asbestos in these areas is found to be very high in the same location where the glucose uptake is very low, one can suspect the presence of mesothelioma, which is often found at the inner wall of the chest cavity or the peritoneum in the abdomen with significantly increased Osteopontine (about 350-400 times that of normal tissue) and very significant increase in Gastrin Releasing Peptides (more than 1200 times that of normal tissue). In some patients, the only abnormal blood chemistry detected was abnormally increased Pro-Gastrin Releasing Peptide. This dark black area on the PET Scan image taken parallel to front and back of chest wall (with marked increase in asbestos, Gastrin-Releasing Peptide, & Osteopontine and marked decrease in glucose uptake in the pathological tissue) can be considered a characteristic finding for the diagnosis of mesothelioma.",

The animal model of Rabbits with Bacterium Endotoxin Induced Fever (BEIF) was established by intravenous injection of bacterial endotoxin. Groups A and AM were treated with 'Qu Chi'(LI11) acupuncture after modeling, and acupuncture manipulations were conducted in group AM. The serum heat factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α content were assayed conducted in group AM. The serum heat factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α content were assayed by Elisa after acupuncturet; the morphological changes of fibroblasts in acupoint area were observed by Vimentin staining; the fibroblasts of subcutaneous connective tissue in acupoint area were isolated and cultured in vitro, and the contents of PEG2, NO and ATP in supernatant were assayed.&lt;br/&gt; Results: There was no significant difference in fibroblasts cytomorphology among groups M, A, and N. Fibroblasts in group AM were stretched and aligned in almost one direction. Comparing with group N, the content of serum IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α was significantly higher in group M, along with higher NO and ATP content in the cell culture supernant; Comparing with group M, content of IL-6 and TNF-α was lower in group A, content of serum IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was higher in group AM, along with higher PEG2, NO and ATP content in both groups, while group AM demonstrated more significant changes in the above indicators than group A.&lt;br/&gt; Conclusion: Acupuncture had therapeutic effects on BEIF rabbits, the application of acupuncture manipulation can further improve its therapeutic effects. The mechanism may be related to the influence on fibroblasts cytomorphology in acupoint region and facilitation of fibroblasts-derived PEG2, NO, and ATP, which together promote the acupoint vitality.",

However, the safety of YNSA and the role of the diagnosis and stimulation points have never been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the safety of YNSA and the relationship between the diagnosis points, the stimulation points, and changes in shoulder stiffness. YNSA was performed at the shoulder point A, acupuncture at the non-shoulder point D, and no intervention as a control in 15 healthy participants three times with a washout period of 1 week. Adverse reactions (changes in blood pressure, changes in heart rate, or bleeding), objective evaluation of the pressure pain threshold (PPT) and muscle hardness (MH) scores at the shoulder, and subjective evaluation of shoulder stiffness with a visual analog scale (VAS) were recorded before, during, and 20 min after stimulation. In the safety evaluation, no adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or bleeding/hematoma were observed. PPT and MH revealed no significant difference between the conditions. There was a significant difference in the VAS between all three conditions ( p = 0.039). Post-hoc analysis showed a significant difference between controls and D-point stimulation ( p = 0.034), but no significant difference between A- and D-point stimulation. VAS subanalysis and post-hoc analysis in right-LI4-positive subjects (n = 4) showed a significant difference in VAS between A-point stimulation and controls ( p = 0.01, 0.015, respectively). Our pilot investigation exhibited the safety of YNSA. Diagnosis and stimulation points may relate to changes in shoulder stiffness; however, further comparative studies with YNSA are required.",

The complexity lies, first of all, from the cellular point of view, which has a greater compartmentalization than the animal cell. Also evolved as terrestrial organisms, plants have developed complex forms of electrochemical communication, developed to the point of suggesting that plants possessed a sort of nervous system, similar to that found in the animal world and in organisms with a high degree of evolution. Over the course of history, numerous researchers, especially in the last century, have alternated trying to penetrate the functional complexity of plants, obtaining results that allowed to tip the scales towards the presence not only of a nervous system, but a complex processing capacity, comparable to a consciousness. The experiment described here, using a polygraphic apparatus connected to an artificial intelligence computerized processing system, made it possible to evaluate the physiopathological responses of a plant subjected to external stimuli of an invasive and non-invasive nature. The technique involved addressing the vegetable \"directly\" during the experimentation. The results obtained have highlighted a logical succession of responses, which have allowed us to conclude that plants possess an advanced capacity for processing external stimuli and also of the human voice.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the \"Omura's ST.36 point\" (True ST.36) needling of young soccer players with the Wingate test. The Wingate test is a widely used and very well known ergometric bicycle test to measure anaerobic power. The Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (B.D.O.R.T.) of Yoshiaki Omura, M.D., Sc.D. was used to determine the \"Omura's ST.36 point\" (True ST.36). Young soccer players (N = 20) between 15-16 years of age (Mean = 15.25 +/- 0.44) were involved in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups (ST.36 and Omura's ST.36) randomly. The groups were statistically similar in respect to their number, age, height and weight respectively, N = 10; 15.40 +/- 0.52, 15.10 +/- 0.32; 171.50 +/- 3.57, 171.00 +/- 4.81; 65.60 +/- 4.01, 61.50 +/- 4.77. The anaerobic power of the subjects were measured using Monark 894E ergometric bicycle. The breaking resistance was 75 g per kg of body weight of the subjects. The peak power, average power, minimum power and power drop were measured as absolute values and per kg of body weight. Subjects were tested twice, with and without acupuncture application. In one group needling was on ST.36, and in the other group it was on \"Omura's ST.36 point.\" Before each test, subjects warmed up for 5 minutes by cycling on the same ergometer at 60 rotations per minute (RPM), without load. Statistically significant increases were measured with the needling of Omura's ST 36 point in peak power (p < 0.01), and relative peak power (p < 0.01) in comparison to Wingate test results without needling. ST.36 needling showed statistically insignificant increases of the same measurements and comparison. We conclude that needling of both points, but especially Omura's ST.36, seem to be effective for increasing the anaerobic power of young soccer players measured with Wingate anaerobic power test. More research is needed to support these findings in all aspects.",

Thus, there is a desire to treat skin before depigmentation and scarring occurs. Therefore, we introduce laser therapy, a widely used technique treat pigmentation in dermatology. Various parameters of laser therapy can be applied, so to determine the optimal exposure parameters that do not damage the surrounding tissues, the subjects were divided into four groups: a non-stimulation group and three laser groups (4 J/cm 2 group, 6 J/cm 2 group, and 8 J/cm 2 group). We selected the wavelength and output of laser as follows: 660nm and 50mW. The 40 were divided into four groups of 10. In the first experiment, we measured skin temperature using Digital infrared thermography in order to observe whether the laser could cause heat damage. In the second experiment, each group received the assigned laser therapy protocol every 24 hours for 72 hours. We obtained a skin image using a cross polarization technique. Previous studies have shown that a * and E.I (erythema index) represent the degree of skin erythema (hemoglobin content). M.I (melanin index) indicates the degree of skin pigmentation (melanin content). Hence, skin color information was analyzed with the a * , erythema index (E.I), and melanin index (M.I) for 72 hours. None of the laser exposure parameters led to skin damage by heating or energy dissipation. The results of a * , E.I, and M.I of all groups showed the different recovery rates towards the normal skin color information before cupping. As energy density increases, the result of a * and E.I showed the fast recovery rate. There was no significant different between M.I at non-stimulation group and M.I at 4 J/cm 2 . Therefore, the least energy density as 6 J/cm 2 is need for the recovery of melanin content. The a * , E.I, and M.I at 8 J/cm 2 group rather than other groups were significantly recovered to normal skin color. In conclusion, the laser therapy (energy density: 8 J/cm 2 ) has a significant recovery of the skin erythema and skin pigmentation except to skin damage.",

Depending upon how external Qi Gong is applied and from which part of the body it emanates, the polarity changes. In general, it was found that, when (+) polarity is applied to the painful area or spastic muscles or arteries in vaso-constriction it often reduced or eliminated the pain, spastic muscles or circulatory disturbances. The author succeeded in storing part of the Qi Gong energy in inanimate materials, such as papers, metals (such as a sheet of aluminum foil), glass, stone, band-aids, clothes, drugs, etc. in bi-polar (one end of the same material becomes (+) polarity and the other end of the same material becomes (-) polarity) form in one material or uni-polar, i.e., the entire material either has pure (+) polarity or (-) polarity. Water, EPA, vitamins, antibiotics and other drugs were also converted to (+) polarity. When the material has a bi-polar state, it becomes possible to eliminate one of the polarities by applying certain changing electrical fields. The effect of placing (+) polarity Qi Gong energy stored material was compared with direct application of the Qi Gong on pain, spastic muscle and spastic vertebral arteries. The therapeutic effects of these 2 methods were quite similar for the identical time duration but a more predictable effect was often obtained in the former. As our previous study indicates that acupuncture, electrical stimulation (1-3 pulses/sec.), as well as Qi Gong not only improved the microcirculatory disturbance and relaxed spastic muscles and vaso-constrictive arteries but also reduced or eliminated the pain and also selectively enhanced drug uptake to the area where drugs could not be delivered due to existing circulatory disturbances, by placing (+) Qi Gong stored material, such as a sheet of paper or aluminum foil, band-aid or clothes. Bi- Digital O-Ring Test evaluation indicated that not only did it produce all the beneficial effects of Qi Gong but also enhanced the drug uptake selectively in the area where it is necessary for the drug to be delivered for effective treatment, and reduced lead deposits in tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This man specialized in cancer treatment by pointing with the fingers of his right hand at his patients, without actually touching them, spending an average of 30 to 40 minutes with each one. The author considered this to be Qi Gong treatment. In March, 1997 the author also observed 2 leading psychic healers in Brazil. One of them, named Rubens Farias, Jr. is a 43 year-old former engineer and computer programmer if European descent, who is commonly known as \"Dr. Fritz III\" because he is believed to be the spirit of Dr. Adolf Fritz, a German physician who died during World War I, operates through him. The other is \"Dr.\" Hirota, a 53 year old former farmer of Japanese decent who lives near Campinas. About 120 kilometers outside of Sao Paulo and treats large numbers of people daily using indirect and/or hand-on healing techniques. On March 6, 1997, when the author visited \"Dr. Fritz III\"'s clinic in Sao Paulo with a group of Brazilian physicians, he was informed the about 1,400 patients had come that day. \"Dr Fritz III\" examined and treated the majority of the patients in less than one minute each, often asking very quick questions and then immediately beginning treatment. Most patients received injections of a dark-brown solution, which, some of the visiting doctors speculated, may be an iodine solution mixed with either alcohol or a local anesthetic. In many patients, he injected this solution near the pathological area or at an acupuncture point near the pathological area. When the needle of the syringe was in the acupuncture pint, he twirled it with his fingers several times and the withdrew it. Minor surgery was performed in about 1/5th of the patients with whom the author observed. Most of the surgical incisions were made on the midline of the tissue over the spine near the pathological area. The clamping of the blood vessels and the closings of the surgical wounds were performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses. Major surgery were done by \"Dr. Fritz III\" who used a rather primitive and unorthodox cutting technique. Except for major surgery, assistance was performed by volunteer nurses, including his wife. After the surgical wounds were closed, gauze band-aids were applied. When the surface of the gauze facing the wound was examined, it showed strong (+) Qi Gong energy according to the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. Essentially, \"Dr. Fritz III\"'s treatment consists of acupuncture, injection of iodine with other substances near the pathological area, and (+) Qi Gong energy stored gauze which is applied to the acupuncture point, pathological area, or the site of surgery. \"Dr.\" Hirota is another famous psychic healer whom the author was able to meet and observe in practice while in Brazil. \"Dr.\" Hirota has been practicing for over 20 years. He usually sees patients who come to his clinic in the mornings and he claims to treat 1,000 to 2,000 patients daily between 9 AM and 12 noon. His main treatment also appears to be the application of external Qi Gong energy through the fingers of his right-hand, in combination with Shiatsu Massage and a manual procedure resembling chiropractic manipulation.",

CPZ itself induced hyperanalgesia, whereas it attenuated EAA in terms of maximal increase of pain threshold as well as EAA after effect. Therefore, CPZ is not a good candidate for enhancing EAA in clinics. Monoamines and their metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the rabbits were detected by high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) method. It was revealed that CPZ enhanced DOPAC and HVA contents in CSF in both the presence and absence of electroacupuncture. CPZ attenuated EAA with elevations of DOPAC and HVA concentration in CSF. There was a positive correlation between the increases of DOPAC and HVA contents in CSF and attenuation effect of CPZ on EAA. These results suggested that activation of dopamine system be unfavorable for EAA.",

Both require a number of treatments or training sessions, both utilize a reward, and both produce an effect that lasts for a length of time after the last treatment or training session. From this information, it would appear that it is possible that the mechanism for the prolonged effect of acupuncture in treating chronic pain is that the repeated activation of the physiological systems by which acupuncture inhibits pain, by the repeated acupuncture treatments, trains the body to continue this activity and thereby maintains the pain relief for a period of time after the last treatment.",

We pursued three types of experiments. In the first one, we tried to examine whether and in what way water exposed to growing and dying spruce seedlings through a quartz test tube (therefore with no chemical contact), influences the germination of seeds and the growth of seedlings of the same species. The second type focused on the issue of whether and in what way distilled water, equally exposed to growing and dying spruce seedlings as well as to different ontogenetic phases of mealworm beetle, can be modified and this modification later on reproduced through a specially developed method of electrophotography. The third type of experiments presented here attempts to find out whether an emission from human hands can non-chemically modify the physical characteristics of distilled water. Their statistical analysis revealed the existence of two different groups of people: those capable of imprinting some form of highly reproducible radiation into water and those at most capable of imprinting only some sort of highly variable radiation. In the future this line of research could provide a scientifically based testing of the actual capabilities of the so-called biotherapists to perform this kind of unconventional healing. The present experiments also represent further indirect evidence for a form of electromagnetic emission from living beings and that such emission alters water in an as yet unknown way.",

Among them is B-endorphin which can be released from the anterior lobe of the pituitary. To examine the role of B-endorphin in EAA and observe CNS metabolic (functional) and behavioral effects of dexamethasone the present study employed the (14C) 2-deoxyglycose (2DG) method. Seventeen adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in five groups received the following different types of somesthetic stimulation to examine the local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) and tail-flick response latency: control group (N = 3), pain group (N = 4), EA group (N = 3), pain + EA group (N = 3; from another ongoing study) and dexamethasone group (N = 4). Dexamethasone reduced tail-flick response latency in response to electroacupuncture, and produced metabolic (functional) changes in a number of CNS structures implicated in electroacupuncture produced analgesia effects (some changes were statistically significant, many others were not). Specific brain structures exhibiting statistically significant changes (p less than 0.05) in LCGU when compared to the pain + EA group are: the parafascicular and habennlar nuclei of the thalamus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. In comparison of dexamethasone group with the other four experimental groups of rats, the following trend in LCGU changes was observed: pain + EA group greater than pain group = EA group = dexamethasone group greater than control group. In addition, dexamethasone had a sedative effect. The results suggest that dexamethasone is reducing EAA and having suppressive effects on CNS metabolism and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" imaging method has been successfully used not only to outline the internal organs but also malignant tumors as long as identical reference control tissue is available, regardless of whether it comes from the same individual or others, without exposing the patient to undesirable radiation from X-Rays, strong magnetic field or ultra-sound. While imaging the outline of the internal organs the author found that, from the surface of each organ, lines or networks of lines extend to other parts of the body. Such a line closely resembles well-known lines of meridians of major internal organs in Oriental medicine. This meridian-like network of each internal organ can be imaged using a microscopic slide, dessicated tissue or raw tissue of the same internal organ as reference control substance in \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" imaging method. In previous papers, among meridians of 12 main internal organs in Traditional Chinese Medicine, the author was able to find which meridian corresponds to which internal organ of Western Medicine as in 10 meridians by \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" imaging with corresponding internal organs as reference control substances, with the exception of \"Pericardium Meridian\", and \"Triple Burner Meridian\". In this study we were able to confirm that the \"Pericardium Meridian\" can be imaged mainly using adrenal gland as a reference control substance and \"Triple Burner Meridian\" can be imaged by the ovary or adrenal gland in the female and also can be imaged by the testes or adrenal gland in the male. Thus, the author was able to confirm, for the first time, the corresponding internal organ of Western Medicine for each one of the 12 main meridians. During this study, when actively imaging the meridian-like network, the author found bulging areas of the meridian-like network at specific locations, and found that these bulging areas correspond to specific acupuncture points. The area or average diameter of these acupuncture points often increased in the abnormal area and returned relatively small normal diameter by acupuncture given on certain acupuncture points of the same meridian. Thus, one can find the exact location of the meridian-like network and specific acupuncture points along the network. Therefore, it is now possible to re-evaluate true effects of giving acupuncture on these specific points as well as some of the other classical concepts of acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTe) is the most common type of thyroid cancer and the most common endocrine malignancy. Although it has a good prognosis, patients experience weight gain, fatigue, and neck pain after total thyroidectomy, and quality of life (QOL) can also decline. There is no effective treatment for these symptoms. This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for treating of fatigue in patients with PTC after total thyroidectomy. Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled study using before and after measurements. The subjects included 25 patients with thyroid cancer who had undergone total thyroidectomy and were experiencing fatigue. Twelve patients underwent Saam (or Sa-Ahm) acupuncture treatment and thirteen subjects did not. Saam acupuncture, which is one of the original therapeutic modalities representing traditional Korean medicine, is a unique treatment method that has a different origin than the modalities from China and Japan. The basic characteristic of combining five shu points in Saam acupuncture is the selection of the tonification and sedation points along the self-meridian and other meridians based on creation and governor relationships. Acupuncture treatment was delivered two times a week for 6 weeks, in 25 to 30 minutes at each session. Acupoints were individually tailored according to the individual pattern of each patient. Fatigue severity and QOL were evaluated using the fatigue scale score and Short Form-36 (SF-36), respectively. Fatigue severity scale is a 9-item self-report questionnaire scale developed by Krupp et al. in 1989. SF-36 is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. Body weight, body mass index, fatigue scale score, and SF-36 score were evaluated pre- and post-treatment, and laboratory tests for biochemical variables were also performed. Results: Fatigue scale score (FSS) significantly improved in the acupuncture group (FSS; 29.92 to 19.50, decrease; 91.7%) compared to the control group (FSS; 29.92 to 31.15, decrease; 46.2%) at post-treatment compared to baseline (p=O. Oll). SF-36 scores were 74.12 in the acupuncture group and 69.02 in the control group, with no statistically significant difference (p=0.085). Weight change did not differ between the two groups. Liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase were lower in the acupuncture group (27.67 to 24.33 IUIL) than in the control group (20.77 to 24.08 IUIL) (p=O. Ol). No other biochemical markers differed between the two groups. Conclusions: Acupuncture such as ST-36, CV-4, KI-10, and HT-8 may relieve fatigue and improve QOL in patients PTC who experience fatigue, and reduced QOL after total thyroidectomy without biochemical changes. A larger prospective study is required to confirm these effects.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture manipulations are clinically important to traditional Chinese medicine, yet the biological mechanisms have not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate continuous stimulation-induced gene expression changes at stimulated and non-stimulated adjacent acupoints in the same meridian. Catgut embedding into acupoint (CEP) was conducted at acupoint Yanglingquan (gall bladder meridian of foot-shaoyang 34, GB34) of Sprague Dawley rats once or continuously for eight weeks, and gene expression changes at GB34 were assessed by gene chip array analysis 72 h after the last CEP treatment. A total of 688 genes exhibited opposite changes in expression between the two treatments, and 1,336 genes were regulated only by the eight-week CEP treatment. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that among these differentially regulated genes by one-time and eight-week CEP treatment, insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway and integrin-linked kinase pathway, and Wnt/~ catenin signaling pathway match the observed gene changes to predicted up/down regulation patterns. Upstream analysis further predicted six molecules, namely, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1~, interleukin la, kallikrein-related peptidase 5, protein kinase Ca, and catenin ~1. On the other hand, continuous eight-week CEP stimulation at acupoint Xuanzhong (GB39) caused similar changes in the expression of 32 genes at acupoints GB34 and Fengshi (GB31) on the same meridian. Taken together, our results provide the first molecular evidence for the local acupoints' mechanisms for acupoint sensitization theory, and implicate the existence of signaling pathways, either direct or indirect, between acupoints within the meridian GB.",

    "abstract": "The action mechanism of acupuncture, one of the alternative methods used in obesity treatment, is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of electro acupuncture on weight loss and whether acupuncture treatment can change circulating levels of irisin, nesfatin-l and preptin, which have been discovered in recent years and plays an important role in nutrition and energy metabolism. Irisin, a newly discovered myokine, is associated with increased energy consumption and has a potential role in obesity. Preptin, present in islet b-cells of pancreas and associated with the carbohydrate metabolism, nesfatin1 is an anorexogenic peptide composed of 82 amino acids and regulates food intake by modulating neuropeptides in feeding centers in the brain. These three new hormones regulate energy intake and expenditure and preserve energy homeostasis and composition. In this study 4 weeks old Sprague Dawley male rats (n=16) were randomly divided into 2 groups which were the control (C): normal diet and obese (0): high fat diet (HFD) groups. 105 After 16 weeks which obesity was developed, electroacupuncture (EA) was performed to rats once in every second days for 3 times weekly for four consecutive weeks. EA was applied bilaterally to Zusanli (ST36), Bai Hui (Du20), He Gu (Li4), Tianshu (ST25) and Sanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints in animals to both groups. Blood was collected before and after EA and serum irisin, nesfatin-l and preptin levels were analyzed by ELISA (Enzyme-InducedImmunosorbent Analysis) method. After four week EA treatment, there was sginificant decrease of the average body weight in both groups rats. There were increases in the serum nesfatin-l and preptin levels in the both groups after acupuncture. A decrease was observed in the irisin levels in obese group, but an increase in the control group. These findings suggest that electroacupuncture may help to weight loss due to its effects on some important metabolic hormones such as irisin, nesfatin-l and preptin only for a few weeks. It is thought that the changes of these hormones levels may playa role in beneficial effect of acupuncture used in the treatment of human obesity. The application of EA in the treatment of obesity is very effective, which may have led to weight loss by altering these hormone levels in obese people.",

These abnormalities were detected non-invasively at areas: 1) 3 brain-related areas of face a) pupils of right &amp; left eyes with b) both ear lobules and c) a small round area of each upper lateral side of forehead; 2) the skin between the base of the 2 orifices of the nose and the upper end of upper lip and 3) Alae of both sides of nose. These invisible significant changes usually last less than 15 seconds after telling a lie. In these areas, Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT), which received a U.S. Patent in 1993, became significantly weak with an abnormal value of (-)7 and TXB2, measured non-invasively, was increased from 0.125∼0.5ng to 12.5∼15ng (within the first 5 seconds) and then went back down to less than 1ng (after 15 seconds). These unique changes can be documented semi-permanently by taking photographs of the face of people who tell a lie, within as short as 10 seconds after saying a lying statement.

Analysis of well-known typical examples of recent mass murderers was presented as examples. Using these findings, potential murderers and people who are very likely to develop problems with others can be screened within 5-10 minutes by examining their facial photographs and signatures before school admission or employment.",

    "abstract": "Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) can be used for various purposes for medical and dental diagnosis as well as for treatment purposes by determining the type of medication and the dosage for a patient. In case of infection, BDORT is a fast and non-invasive way to decide what kind of antibiotic and the dosage to be given to patient. If a patient already has been on a certain antibiotic for days, the clinician could use BDORT with diode (with arrow signs of the diode pointing to the patient) to test the same drug. Otherwise without diode, if BDORT result is negative, it could either mean the negative result might be due to resonance phenomenon or it may be because the antibiotic is ineffective. Either way, if O-Ring would be open during testing, the clinician should gradually increase or decrease the dosage of antibiotic to find out if BDORT result begins to become positive. In great majority of cases involving less effective old generation antibiotics, it is usually due to resistant microbia that require increasing dosage of antibiotic to make it become more effective. If increasing dosage would make O-Ring close, then the increased dosage would be effective to the patient. If the result is negative, the clinician should consider switching to another antibiotic regimen that may be tested positive with BDORT. Old generation antibiotics have not necessarily lost usefulness or lack efficacy on those new emerging resistant bacteria. Clinicians may just need to increase the dosage of those older generation antibiotics to make them more effective. In fact, with so many antibiotic-resisting strains of bacteria, clinician often face dilemma whether to switch to newer generation of antibiotics or just to increase the dosage of the older generation of antibiotics that a patient has been taking. When testing antibiotic of penicillin-related medication including amoxicillin, the thymus tablet (bovine source) should also be used for the testing after initially testing without it. Such a double checking system will avoid the false signal from BDORT about the drugs of penicillin family.",

    "abstract": "Common practice of establishing occlusal vertical dimension by adopting traditional method for patients with long-term pathological conditions has left the results much less than desired, since the degree of pathological condition for each patient varies from one patient to another, and traditional methods to determine vertical dimension are mostly intended for normal patients. Ideally, the occlusal vertical dimension should be dictated by, and conformed to patient's comfort range for the physiological accommodation to each patient's condition. This article describes a method of a double checking system for occlusion determination by increasing vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) by 1/2 mm each week to find the most comfort zone and beyond for patient, and then to gradually decrease ½ mm of the VDO each week to the original VDO to double check the comfort zone for the patient. During the process, Bi-Digital O-Ring Test was employed to corroborate, to determine, and to individualize the occlusal vertical dimension for patients with pathological abnormalities. Traditional methods of vertical dimension determination were merely used as a guiding reference in our treatment of those patients. Patient's comfort and discomfort were carefully recorded, compared and studied before the denture prosthesis was fabricated.",

    "abstract": "Background: Dry needling is suggested as a novel and promising method for treating spasticity and functions after stroke. Objectives: To understand the effects of dry needling and neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT) compared to NDT alone on post-stroke spasticity and functions. Materials and Methods: Forty-two patients with post-stroke spasticity were randomized into two groups: NDT and dry needling (n=21) or NDT alone (n=21). Dry needling was applied over the study group's gastrocnemius, quadriceps femoris, flexor carpi radialis, and biceps brachii muscles. The Modified Ashworth Scale and range of movement (ROM) assessment were used to assess spasticity before treatment (T1), immediately after the 1 st session (T2), and after the 12 th session (T3), while Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), and Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) Scale were used to assess functions at T1 and T3. Results: Dry needling and NDT were more effective in improving the gastrocnemius muscle tone (χ 2 =9.31; p=.025) than NDT alone. Compared to NDT alone group the improvement was higher on all ROM measurements in the dry needling and NDT group, which was more remarkable at T2 than T3. The dry needling and NDT group exhibited more significant improvements in the upper extremity (NHPT; F=88.316, p&lt;.001, η 2 =.694), lower extremity (10 MWT; F=7.075, p=.011, η 2 =.495), and balance (FAB; F=58.435, p&lt;.001, η 2 =.600) functions compared to the NDT alone group. Conclusion: Dry needling and NDT effectively reduce spasticity but only significantly in the gastrocnemius muscle. Dry needling and NDT is also more effective than NDT alone in improving upper and lower limb and balance functions in stroke patients. Trial Registration : The trial was registered to ClinicalTrials. gov (identifier: NCT03863678) on March 5, 2019.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : HPV is a family of double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the mucous epithelium. Most of these infections regress without consequences; however, the high-risk HPV viral strains can determine a tumor transformation of the epithelium, giving rise to tumor forms such as cervical cancer. The analysis mostly applied to define abnormalities of the membranes is the PAP test and the treatment is reconciled, in most cases through prevention. Alongside the standard protocol, we have determined that a blend of essential oils has an effect in determining the negativization of HPV. Materials and Methods : We made use of the BDORT technique in order to determine the specific percentages of each component of the prepared oil blend. To confirm this, two advanced Molecular Docking software have been applied (Swiss Dock and 1-Click Docking). The mixture of oils was subsequently applied, in the form of vaginal capsules, on a group of HPV (+) positive patients, who were tested for the presence of a virus, before and after treatment, by RT-PCR, Colposcopy, and BDORT to evaluate the state of epithelium before and after the assumption of oil vaginal capsules. Results : The mixture of oils has produced the negativization of HPV, determined by BDORT and confirmed by RT-PCR, in the treated patients. Discussion: We have determined that the blend of essential oils, prepared here, influenced the negativization of the virus, in all the patients treated. Conclusions: The operative efficacy of these oils in the negativization of HPV has been demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test electromagnetic resonance phenomena between 2 identical substances, first the pineal gland representational (rep.) areas were localized on the 5 different locations on the surface of the head using microscope slides of the pineal gland or Melatonin (while the eyes are closed) as a reference control substance. The 3 pineal rep. areas along the mid-line of the head always showed two lobes connected as a \"Dumbbell\" shape, with one round or oval area at each side of the mid-line. From each side of the head, anterior and superior to the ear, it appeared in a shape resembling the side view of a pineal gland. When both eyes were open, Melatonin, Norepinephrine (NE), and Acetylcholine (ACh) markedly decreased, while Serotonin, Dopamine, and GABA increased significantly in the outer part of the pineal gland rep. areas. When both eyes were closed, Melatonin, NE and ACh increased markedly, with marked decrease in Serotonin, Dopamine and GABA in the outer part of the pineal gland rep. areas. However, in the inner core of the pineal gland rep. area, an opposite response was found. Thus, the pineal gland has 2 main lobes, and functionally each lobe seems to have two concentric areas with an inverse relationship, i.e., a \"Functional Cortex\" area and a \"Functional Core\" area. The biochemical changes between the cortex and the core are in an inverse relationship. Melatonin was also found in the S-A node & right side of normal heart when the eyes were closed. When the eyes were open, Melatonin was found in the left side of the heart, as well as the salivary glands, stomach, colon, etc. While both eyes were closed, when a weak light beam was exposed at different parts of the body, such as any part of the upper and lower extremities, Melatonin, NE, and ACh decreased, with an increase in Serotonin, GABA and Dopamine only in the functional cortices of the pineal gland lobes on the same side of the body. Even when both eyes were open, if a very weak narrow beam of light was exposed on any part of the body, Melatonin, NE and ACh decreased, while Serotonin, Dopamine and GABA increased compared with pre-exposure level in only the functional cortices of the pineal gland lobes in the same side of the light exposure, and the opposite effect was also observed in the functional core of the light exposed side only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Animals were divided into four groups, the ovariectomized electroacupuncture group (OV+EA group, n = 7), the ovariectomized group (OV group, n = 4), the EA group (n = 3) and the control group (CT group, n = 4). Number of AgNORs of 100 cells from zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in each case of the four groups was counted at random and the mean+/-SE (number/cell) in each group was calculated as follows: OV+EA group, 2.71 +/- 0.26, OV group, 1.26 +/- 0.15, EA group, 1.21 +/- 0.04 and CT group, 1.48 +/- 0.03. The mean of AgNORs in OV+EA group differed highly significantly from the other three groups (p less than 0.01) as tested with ANOVA and LSD method. No significant difference was found among the other three groups. Gross specimen examination showed that adrenals in the OV+EA group were significantly heavier than those in the other three groups (p less than 0.01). Vaginal smears showed that a response like estrogen-induced one with exfoliative cells appeared in the OV+EA group. EA had no significant effect on normal rats. The results suggest that EA may promote the synthesis and secretion of adrenal steriod hormones, the androgen of which will then be transformed into estrogen in other tissues, thus compensating the deficiency of estrogen induced by ovariectomy.",

The therapy consists of corticosteroids and analgetics. There was a 70 year old woman who suffered from painful paresis of the abducent and oculomotor nerves following an infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi--but without ocular symptoms. The treatment with corticosteroids reduced the palsy but she complained of excessively painful attacks in the region of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. Opiold analgetic therapy did not bring about any relief. Acupuncture is an irritative method with a physical effect on the nervous system: its pain-reducing effect is caused by the activation of transmitters like endorphins in thalamus and brain stem. Knowing this effect, the THS patient, after informed consent, was treated with acupuncture. To measure the extent of pain, a visual analog scale (0: no pain - 10: maximum pain) was used. Acupuncture was performed according to the empirical rules of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), during a period of 10 weeks and 12 weeks. There was a significant pain relief after acupuncture from VAS 10 to VAS 5. The effect vanished during the next four months. After a second series of 12 sessions pain reduction was reported from VAS 10 to 4. One year after the last Tolosa Hunt Syndrome - intractable pain pain strength ranged between VAS 4 - 6. Therefore acupuncture seems to be a good additional method for reduction of intractable pain.",

M.D. To determine the relationship of the Lung Meridian of TCM and the points drawn with a histological human Lung slide by BDORT, it was mapped the upper limb in 41 healthy individuals. There were almost identical matches in all points in 26 subjects (63.4%). In 15 subjects there were no identical matches at any point (36.5%). In all cases of no identical matches of the points, the new Lu1 point is displaced in the direction of midpoint of thorax below the clavicle. On the arm there was a medially deviation in comparison to the line obtained from the TCM points, for example the new Lu9 point was located on the midpoint of the wrist.",

    "abstract": "Poison ivy contact dermatitis is fairly common in the suburbia of this country among amateur gardeners and children. It commonly inflicts its poison on the exposed parts of the limbs. The vesicular or bullous skin lesions are quite disturbingly itchy. Scratching the itchy lesions often spreads the condition by transplanting the remanent resinous toxin to other parts of the body. Though they are usually self-limiting, the intense itch is the main motivation for a patient to seek medical care. The conventional treatment is basically ineffective. During the summer of 1987 we treated four such cases of dermatitis with acupuncture upon their request to mollify their unbearable itch. They originally consulted with us for other problems. There were three males and one female. Their ages were between 29 and 63. Three cases were relatively mild and the fourth one was fairly severe. In the milder cases, their itch subsided in a few hours and skin lesions were healed in about two days after one treatment. In the severe case the itch subsided in about two days and most of the skin lesions dried up in four days after the first treatment and were healed almost completely after three sessions of acupuncture treatment. The plausible anti-inflammatory mechanism of acupuncture with the involvement of ACTH and/or cortisol was discussed.",

Even if the longitudinal aspect of this nucleus is not uniform, it must be pointed out that the three branches of the trigeminal nerve are represented along this course through the trigeminal spinal tract. These relations explain the straight reciprocal action of the nerve areas of the trigeminal branches with the first four cervical nerves and the related autonomic links. These direct elementary reflexes may explain: many referred symptoms; etiologic or triggering factors of neuralgias in the entire cervico-cephalic region; the treatment of the cervico-cephalic diseases (of cerebrospinal or autonomic type) by stimulation of the various cervico-cephalic structures: acupuncture points, articular manipulations, massages, etc... an important part of auriculopuncture effects; the possibility to use points localized in various nerve areas to get the same action.",

These changes induced by NDR stimulation were not effected by electroacupuncture (EA) when EA was performed on the background of NDR stimulation. By comparing these results with the previous resultant that immunoreactions were affected by locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation and LC stimulation plus EA, some regularity had been discovered. So, a hypothesis was put forward by us that the catecholaminergic system plays a main role in EA regulation of cellular immunity while the serotonergic system plays such a role in EA regulation of humoral immunity.",

While imaging outline of the internal organs the author found that from the surface of each organ, lines or networks of lines extending to the other parts of the body. Such a line closely resembled classically well known lines of meridians of major internal organs in Oriental medicine which author named meridian-like network of each internal organ. Each internal organ's meridian-like network usually can be imaged using microscopic slide of tissue or tissue itself. However, entire part of the small intestine meridian in the arm can also be imaged by heart tissue. For example \"spleen meridian\" has been considered to represent mainly pancreas of the western medical concept and this was also confirmed by the fact that using microscopic slide of pancreas or dessicated tissue of the pancreas well-known spleen meridian-like network can be imaged. The author also confirmed some of the description of the direction of the meridian and direction of the in reference to the direction of the insertion of the acupuncture needle. The width of the line of this meridian-like network was usually within one or two millimeters and one millimeter outside of the line do not have the same characteristics. This meridian-like network seems to be specialized channel which can propagate some type of information in electro-magnetic field to regulate some of the body functions throughout the body which is difficult to explain in current western medical anatomical concept.",

The patients were divided into two groups: group A, eleven patients receiving neuroleptanesthesia combined with acupuncture analgesia and group N, thirteen patients receiving usual neuroleptanesthesia without acupuncture. A significant difference was found in the dose of fentanyl, used as the narcotic, between group A (0.11 mg) and group N (0.48 mg). No difference was noted in blood pressure between the two groups, but it was high in group N in the postoperative period. There was no difference in heart rate between the two groups. Two patients from group A and five from group N required analgesics in the postoperative period. Nausea and vomiting were encountered in one patient in group A and three in group N. Therefore, it would seem that anesthesia in combination with acupuncture is capable of reducing the required dose of narcotic and offering more comfortable postoperative conditions than usual anesthesia alone.",

Compared with the control group at the matched age, the expression levels of the genes of cerebrum of acupunctured mice were all affected after acupuncturing acupoints, the genes that over express with aging were down-regulated (acupuncture decreases the expression level of related genes) but that less express were up-regulated (acupuncture increases the expression level of related genes). These changes all showed a tendency towards expression level of the young mice. We observed for the first times at the transcriptional levels that the effect of acupuncture is the adjustment that probably interferes with the senescence process from whole body and proved also the acupoints have specificity of treating compared with non-acupoints.",

    "abstract": "When the window of an Asbestos-contaminated room from a broken ceiling was opened wide, A 73 year-old male physician of Oriental origin, who was sitting in the next room, suddenly developed a severe asthma attack, which did not stop by the use of a hand-held Albuterol inhaler. Temporary relief was obtained only by using a Compressor-Nebulizer (Inspiration 626 with Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution 0.083%). During the attack, abnormal areas were discovered at the upper lobes of both lungs, where Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) was markedly increased to 500 ng (BDORT units) (the rest of the lung had about 2.5 ng), 2 types of Asbestos (Chrysotile and Crocidolite) were abnormally increased to 0.120-0.135 mg, (BDORT units) Acetylcholine was markedly reduced to 0.5 ng (the rest of the lung was low, about 100 ng), DHEA was extremely reduced to 1 ng (the rest of the lung had about 52 ng), and telomere was less than 1 yg (= 10(-24) g). Bacterial & viral infections were also present in these abnormal areas, but no antibiotics entered the abnormal parts of the lungs. Therefore, one optimal dose of Astragalus was given once, which resulted in a rapid continuous excretion of large amounts of the above 2 types of Asbestos & TXB2 in urine & sputum, and Asthma symptoms reduced slightly in severity. Additional acupuncture & shiatsu given on all the known acupuncture points for lung disease only created slight, temporary improvement. Then, the respiratory & cardiac center of the Medulla Oblongata was found to have similar abnormalities as the lungs. Therefore, 100 mW output of Light Emitting Diode of red spectra (650 nm center spectrum) was projected on the abnormal area of the medulla oblongata on the back of the head. This resulted drug uptake of on and off and significantly reduced difficulty of breathing. Additional application of the EMF Neutralizer on the abnormal area of the Medulla Oblongata for 3 hours resulted in continuous drug uptake and complete disappearance of asthma. As a result of one optimal dose of Astragalus, the remaining Asbestos in the lungs & medulla oblongata was completely excreted in the urine and Sputum in 2 weeks. Then, even when the patient entered the Asbestos-contaminated room and slept there every day without opening the window, no asthma attack occurred even as late as 5 months later.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have seen extensive interest in treatment of various diseases with adult stem cells (ASC). This paper will not discuss umbilical cord or adipose tissue derived stem cells, but rather peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). We will demonstrate that one of the natural roles of stem cells is to participate in tissue repair both due to injury or degenerative disease. We will review the mechanisms involved with stem cell release and activation and present two new natural triggers for this release and possible differentiation. The clinical relevance of mobilizing endogenous bone marrow derived stem cells would be to increase the number migrating into damaged organs, becoming affective cells and contributing to tissue repair. This approach overcomes the problems of growing autologous stem cell cultures and their implantation. It also may release other progenitor cells that appears to be playing a vital role in organ regeneration. We present examples of tissue repair using these new modalities. Part of this paper was first presented at the international conference of acupuncture and electrotherapeutics held at Columbia University Oct. 2013. Since then the field has exploded and we will try to include some of the most relevant discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Oncothermia (OTM) is based on electromagnetic interactions with the living matter. Its nano-targeting approach establishes a new paradigm. OTM could be applied not only to treat malignancies but it is feasible to apply for other diseases too. OTH is well proven method from the laboratory level to the clinical applications, promoting the natural processes, re-establishing of the synchronization between the cells. This approach allows therapy of some non-malignant diseases too. Our objective is to use OTM for the irregularities of tissue-growth and for pain syndromes as well. OTM uses precisely tuned radiofrequency (RF) current flowing through the treated part of the body. We made extensive study, proving in details the applicability of the OTM for Dupuytren's contracture and chronic low back pain, in conjunction with permanent acupuncture method, a modified process of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The synergy of the ancient and the state-of-art medical knowledges is the basic method of the present research. Our results with application of OTM for chronic low back pain and Dupuytren's contracture shows definite improvements of the patients involved in the study. We measured the success with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with anecdotic quality of life (QoL), and the shortening of the of-work period due to the disease. We measured that VAS decreased significantly, the hand contracture became less rigid and less contracted. The QoL of patients improved and their complaints which blocked their regular activity has significantly reduced. OTM method was safe &amp; no adverse effects were observed. Recognition of the distortions in the healthy tissue have some common principles and possibilities in TCM and OTM: both the methods recognize the loss of complexity of the living organization. Data of our recent study verified the relevant end-points of our present study: the safety, the quality of life (QoL), the prolonged painless status of the patient.",

    "abstract": "Restoration of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium termed reperfusion unavoidably leads to many heart complications (such as rhythm abnormalities, and sequentially heart failure), together with the induced damage of cardiomyocytes, which can worsen infarct size and is termed myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Electroacupuncture plays an important role in attenuating I/R injury. High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) is upregulated in myocardial I/R injury and activates the inflammatory response which enhances the myocardial injury. In our study, we aimed to detect the roles of electrical acupuncture at Neiguan acupoints (PC6) in myocardial I/R injury and investigate the relationship between electrical acupuncture and HMGB1-related pathway. We found that electrical acupuncture pretreatment protected against myocardial I/R injury through inhibiting cell apoptosis. Electroacupuncture also decreased the expression levels of HMGB1 and inflammatory cytokines induced by I/R injury. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) was decreased by electroacupuncture in heart tissues. Furthermore, the effects of electrical acupuncture pretreatment were abrogated by the additional administration of recombinant HMGB1. Finally, the SP600125 administration, a selective JNK inhibitor, attenuated HMGB1-dependent cell apoptosis and cytokines release in myocardial I/R injury. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that electrical acupuncture at PC6 plays a protective role in myocardial I/R injury, and this effect is associated with inhibited HMGB1-JNK pathway, which provides a beneficial therapeutic strategy for patients with myocardial I/R injury.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroendocrinology and immunology have provided an entry to understand acupuncture. Here, we highlight these progresses and use endometriosis as an example to provide a perspective in how to effectively engage acupuncture into modern biomedicine. Endometriosis is a common chronic inflammatory disease in which endometrial tissue progressively grows outside the uterine cavity and into the pelvic region, including the fallopian tubes and ovaries. Also, estrogen promotes the endometriosis progression through on-site inflammation. Current treatments for endometriosis involve hormonal therapy and surgical procedures, however, they both may induce several side effects. Several studies have shown that the administration of exogenous dopamine agonists can significantly suppress endometriosis progression. Acupuncture is multivalent in which it can simultaneously stimulate the secretion of endogenous dopamine to modulate the GnRH neuroendocrine pathway in CNS and the COX-2 inflammatory pathway in PNS. Hence, acupuncture can smoothly manage endometriosis without the side effects of exogenous dopamine. The endometriosis management by acupuncture provides us an example of how to incorporate acupuncture into current biomedical systems. Acupuncture may provide a convenient, physiological method to regulate the neuroendocrine system in an integrative, systematic means.",

    "abstract": "PAM, a cholinesterase reactivator, was administered orally and parenterally to 37 patients with multiple sclerosis and a control group of 24 patients with other neurological diseases and pain syndromes. The effects of the administration of this compound in these patients with and without electrical stimulation of the spinal cord were studied. The clinical response to the drug follows a known time course and is dose related. Administration of large doses orally or intravenously aggravates existing neurological dysfunction. With a dose of 1,000 mg intravenously, a characteristic response is the temporary appearance of new ophthalmological abnormalities, followed by significant improvement in motor control and behavior, which gradually subsides. Parenteral administration is superior to oral. Tolerance to the drug is observed. The presence of electrical stimulation of the spinal cord complements the action of the drug. When electrical stimulation is withdrawn, the effect of the drug reproduces the effect of the electrical stimulation. It is suggested there is a defect in cholinesterase in multiple sclerosis patients, and its reactivation may have a significant relationship to signs and symptoms.",

However, it actually denotes movement and activity. The word element implies a stationary state. Some of the evidence in ancient Chinese literature was reviewed to support the hypothesis that Five Xing were originally meant to be the Five Xing Xin (Moving Stars, i.e., Planets). By the 4th century B.C., associations of the Stars with human events gradually evolved. However, between the 4th and the 6th century A.D., when the Taoist scholar-physicians expanded the Five Xing into abstractive concepts, they used the five basic materials as their representatives. Since they were basically alchemists and not astronomers, they apparently minimized the relationship between the Five Moving Stars and the human illnesses. It is, therefore, proposed that the usage of the word Element be discontinued and the word Xing be employed as is.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study indicates the principle that information on the molecular structure and its quantity will be transmitted bi-directionally through a red-spectrum soft laser beam when specific molecules are placed in the close vicinity of the laser beam. The method was immediately applied for diagnosing diseases or localizing specific substances, using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, in moving or stationary animals or human subjects at clearly visible distances, without directly contacting the subject. This principle was also applied for the microscopic Bi-Digital O-Ring Test to examine cellular structures and substances within the cell at the magnified focused projected plane. The method was further expanded to an electron-microscopic Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, where, instead of a light beam as a source of electromagnetic wave carrier, an electron beam was used. Thus, it was possible to study the ultra-fine structure of cells. During the past several years, the author has been experimenting with the question of whether, instead of using visible light in the microscopic Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, if much shorter wavelengths, such as X-ray with strong penetrating force through living tissue, are used as the carriers of molecular information, and if X-ray pictures of the body are evaluated by a similar method as in the microscopic Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, molecular information existing in the pathways of the X-ray through the body might be detectable or not. Our studies indicate that, using X-ray film with good picture quality taken of specific parts of the body, one can detect not only specific microbial infections, such as bacterial, viral, or spirochete (e.g., Lyme), and changes in local chemistry including blood chemistry such as glucose, total cholesterol, uric acid, in major arteries or the heart, but also potentially effective medication. Using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test resonance phenomenon between a reference control substance and an identical substance or its electromagnetic field imprint, anatomical structures of the soft tissue, such as blood vessels, nerves, and muscles can be identified even when they are not visible on the X-ray film because of the masking effect of other tissues with high density or large volume of tissue. Similar findings were also found in the CAT Scan and MRI pictures of normal and abnormal organs of the body. In this paper, two examples of such analyses, i.e. X-ray films of one patient with adenocarcinoma of the colon and another patient with rheumatoid arthritis of the knee joint are shown.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a disease defined by excessive fat storage in the body. It is an energy balance problem; the increase in body fat is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. This study aimed to determinate the changes in the anthropometric measurements of patients after acupuncture treatment used in obesity treatment. The present study was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2019 in xxx University's GETAT Center). Patients aged between 18–65 years with a BMI &gt; 25 were included in the study. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (acupuncture and diet) and Group 2 (diet only). Exclusion criteria: Pregnant women, breastfeeding patients , susceptible demographics (acute coronary insufficiency, immunodeficiency, severe psychotic disorder, liver and kidney failure), and those who could not give consent were not included in the study. Weight, BMI, and metabolic age values were measured with a Tanita device; the same diagnostic device was used for all patients. Both body and ear acupuncture were performed. In patients with all acupuncture, the yuan points of abnormal meridians were used for pulse diagnosis. ST 24, 25, and 36 (ZuSanLi); GV 20, 21, 5, 5, and LR 3 (Taichong); SP 6 and 9, GB 34, UB 62, HT 7, LU 9, and PC 6 (Nei Guan); and SI 3 and EXT-HN 3 (Yin-Tang) points were dewed. For ear acupuncture, hunger, kidney, larynx, stomach, jerome, and shen-men points were taken. A t-test was applied to pre- and post-acupuncture measurement values. After acupuncture, the waist circumference of the participants decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.005). The BMI of the participants also decreased significantly after acupuncture (p &lt; 0.005). In these studies, LU 6, ST 40, ST 21, K 4, ST 36 and 25, and LI 11 body points were used, while hunger, stomach, and shen-men points were commonly used as ear points.",

Methods A total of 80 SPF male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, model group, sham electroacupuncture group, acupuncture group, electroacupuncture group and 16 rats in each group. The rat model of left ischemic stroke was prepared by suture embolization. In the sham group, the left common carotid artery was isolated only and no other treatment was given. In the electroacupuncture group, \"Baihui\" and \"Mingmen\" were selected for acupuncture, followed by dilatation wave, frequency 2Hz/100Hz, intensity 1mA, and electroacupuncture for 30min. The sham electroacupuncture group was the same as the electroacupuncture group in acupoint electroacupuncture group was the same as the electroacupuncture group in acupoint selection. The electroacupuncture group was only inserted subcutaneously and then connected with the electroacupuncture group without power supply, and fixed for 30 minutes. The electroacupuncture group and the acupuncture group received electroacupuncture treatment once, for a total of 14 days, 1d after modeling. The Improved Neurological Impairment scale (mNSS) was used to evaluate the degree of neurological impairment in each group after anesthesia and wakefulness. The percentage of cerebral infarction area was determined by TTC staining. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to observe the pathological changes of ischemic brain tissue. The level of apoptosis in ischemic brain tissue was detected by TUNEL assay. Western blot was used to detect protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Cleaved caspase-3 in ischemic brain tissue. Results Compared with the sham operation group, neurological function score, percentage of cerebral infarction area and apoptosis level in the model group were significantly increased (all P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the model group, neurological function score, percentage of cerebral infarction area and apoptosis index of acupuncture group and electroacupuncture group were decreased (all P &lt;0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression levels of Bcl-2 protein in ischemic brain tissue of rats with ischemic stroke were up-regulated in the acupuncture group and electroacupuncture group to different degrees, while the expression levels of Bax and Cleaved caspase-3 protein were down-regulated in the electroacupuncture group. Conclusion Electroacupuncture may inhibit Bax, Cleaved caspase-3 and up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 against neuronal apoptosis, thereby improving the neurological function injury of ischemic stroke rats.",

Methods: Two reviewers collected and screened the literature, and extracted relevant information, including: course of disease, random method, intervention measures, course of treatment, detection indicators, adverse reactions, etc. Quality assessment, meta-analysis, publication bias and sensitivity analysis were performed. The main outcomes included total effective rate and serum uric acid, while secondary outcomes included pain integral, adverse events and follow-up shedding etc. Results: 26 RCTs were screened out, with a total of 2048 participants. The results show that the total effective rate of single acupuncture treatment of gouty arthritis is higher than that of the Western medicine group [OR = 4.33, 95% CI (3.22, 5.82)], and it had a certain clinical advantage in reducing the level of uric acid [MD = –68.39, 95% CI(–97. 47, –39.31)], the analgesic effect is equivalent to that of Western medicine. There were no adverse reactions were reported in the single acupuncture treatment group. Conclusion: The results show that single acupuncture is more effective and safer than Western medicine in the treatment of gouty arthritis. However, due to the low quality of the included literature, these results should be interpreted with caution; more scientific clinical RCTs are needed to verify the effect of single acupuncture on gouty arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Propagated sensation along channels occurs because of stimulations during acupuncture therapies and tends to transmit the stimulating signals along the meridians. From the Western medicine aspect, researchers consider the phenomena as neurotransmissions initiated by nerves, and various ions regulate the physiological functions of the nervous systems. Objective: This research investigates the critical characteristics of ions at acupoints and the mechanism of propagated sensation along channels, crossing meridians in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: This research first conducts experiments by applying intense pulse light beams, which replace the traditional acupuncture treatments, on designated acupoints of studied human subjects, and employs a thermal infrared imager to monitor the temperature responses, which are induced by post sensation, in adjacent regions of the acupoints. Meanwhile, the research applies a synchrotron radiation technique on adult SD (Sprague Dawley) rats. The study analyzes the output responses with an X-ray Absorption Fine Spectroscopy (XAFS) to investigate the ion distributions in the relevant acupoints, which trigger the propagated sensation crossing meridians. Results: Experimental results demonstrate significant temperature increases simultaneously at the stimulated acupoints and specific other acupoints, whether in the same meridians. Moreover, XAFS experimental results indicate significantly high calcium, potassium, and sulfide ions at the stimulated acupoint regions. On the contrary, the measured chloride ions level at the regions is correspondingly lower. Conclusions: The thermal infrared imager monitoring shows significant temperature variations of crossing-meridian acupoints after implementing the intense pulse light beams on designated acupoints, and it implies the occurring of prolonged sensation along channels using acupuncture therapies. The X-ray absorption spectrum demonstrates significant differences in ion amounts and distributions between the acupoints and non-acupoints, and acupuncture therapies result in ion concentrations in the correlated regions inducing propagated sensation crossing meridians in TCM. Hence, the stimulated acupoints operate as ion reservoirs to provide high-concentration of specific ions to trigger the crossing-meridian post sensation.",

Whether such combination is effective and safe should be studied although it is recommended by some researchers.&lt;br/&gt; Methods: To explore the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture combined with chemical drugs for AD, databases like PubMed, Web of Science were searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on AD treated with acupuncture and chemical drugs to perform meta-analysis. The risk of bias in each study was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta- analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.&lt;br/&gt; Results : Five studies were included in which only donepezil combined with acupuncture was evaluated. Acupuncture combined with donepezil showed a significant difference in effectiveness rate [RR=1.45, 95% CI (1.19, 1.77), P =0.0002] compared with donepezil. On the comparison of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) score there was no difference. However, after one trial with severe AD patients was removed, acupuncture combined with donepezil showed better effect than donepezil alone.&lt;br/&gt; Conclusion : Acupuncture combined with donepezil could work on AD at the early stage or being mild, implying that acupuncture could be a complementary therapy for AD at the early stage or being mild. Besides, scalp acupuncture seems to be more effective on improving cognitive function. However, this conclusion must be considered cautiously, given the small sample size and lack of trials with high quality. Therefore, more high-quality, multicenter, prospective RCTs with large sample sizes are needed to further clarify the effect of acupuncture combined with chemical drugs for AD.",

Since 2000, the author has found that when BDORT is performed while an individual with a malignant tumor is talking, BDORT became (-1 approximately -10) in 94% of 200 cases and the number of openings (-) is approximately proportional to the degree of abnormality up to -10. Thus, cancer can be screened from voice within 1 min., without any instruments. Also, when cancer-free persons hold slides of cancer tissue or 10ng or higher Oncogene C-fos Ab2 or Integrin alpha5beta1 while talking over a short or long distance, BDORT always opens. To identify the type of the patient's malignancy, if BDORT is performed by an examiner holding a microscope slide of cancer tissue identical to the patient's cancer, characteristic strong BDORT resonance phenomenon appears with opening of all O-Rings formed between thumb and other fingers. When patients with myocardial infarct or various infections speak, no O-Rings open without holding identical pathological substances. Thus, it is possible to detect any type of malignancy from the voice, as long as a set of about 35 different tumor tissue slides is available. Based on these new findings, the author concluded that the voice of an individual with a malignancy carries information about the amount and structure of molecules present in malignant tissue.",

    "abstract": "Electrical excitation of tooth pulp afferents seems to be a most accurate and reproducable method to produce graded pain with minimal injury of the tissues. Besides electrical current only thermal stimulation may activate pulp nerves of an intact tooth, but this method lacks the precision of the electrical stimulation and bears more risk of injury. Surrounded by enamel of high resistance and capasitance the pulp nerves are difficult stimulation objects. On the other hand with careful stimulation the current is almost completely restricted to the pulp. The square wave current pulse is \"deformed\" according to the time constant of hard tissues and exceptionally long durations are needed. There is ultimate necessity for constant current stimulation because of varying anatomy and resistance of the teeth. When different amplitudes and durations of current pulses are used to compare perception thresholds of human teeth and firing thresholds of single pulp nerve fibres of the cat, it may be concluded that \"prepain\" sensation is experienced using current values that activate only A-fibres. To attain the pain threshold, recruitment of more A-delta fibres with increasing current is needed, but the lowest thresholds of C-fibres are even higher.",

    "abstract": "Using the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification and Localization Method,\" one can identify and localize minute amounts of bioactive substances (including neurotransmitters), micro-organisms, toxic substances, or drugs, and, in addition, one can non-invasively image normal organs as well as screen for and image the distribution of specific types of cancer of specific internal organs without using any expensive instrumentation. One can also use this method to perform a qualitative analysis of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones on different parts of the imaged organs. The molecule or substance being investigated is compared with a minute amount of a pure control reference substance, and if the substance identical to the control reference substance exists, then the electro-magnetic waves emitted by the identical substance will produce an electro-magnetic resonance phenomenon with the electro-magnetic waves of identical resonance frequency emitted by the control reference substance, and this resonance phenomenon is hypothesized to be the basis of the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification and Localization Method.\" The following substances have been used as control reference substances to identify and localize identical substances in vitro and in vivo: pure neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin, beta-endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, norepinephrine, dopamine, L-dopa, substance P, etc.), as well as L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine; cholesterol; steroid hormones (including aldosterone, corticosterone, cortisol, progesterone, testosterone, etc.); peptide hormones; microscopic slides of normal organs; microscopic slides of specific cancer cells of specific organs (e.g. adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas, adenocarcinoma of the descending colon, etc.); microscopic slides of pure micro-organisms; toxic substances (e.g. lead, mercury, KCN); drugs (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, etc.); and antibodies against specific substances or micro-organisms. An intensive network of serotonin and L-tryptophan was discovered, by using the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification and Localization Method,\" in different parts of the body. In general, in painful areas, frequently serotonin is markedly reduced, L-tryptophan is markedly increased, and substance P is markedly increased, while in non-painful areas, serotonin is markedly increased, L-tryptophan is markedly decreased, and substance P is markedly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The physiological correlates of these features are discussed as they apply to therapy of psychosomatic disorders. Both acupuncture and meditation are characterized by alpha rhythms of the encephalograms, by relaxed wakefulness, by analgesia, by their pervasion of virtually the entire body. This set of correspondences is taken as sufficient to postulate that acupuncture induces a stillness with properties similar to those of the \"quiet\" of meditation. This induced deep relaxation may account for the vasolidation and increased vascular-capillary flow, intrinsic in acupuncture. Among the shared properties are the presence of low physiological noise-level and unresponsiveness to the aversive components of conditioned stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The flexsor muscle electromyogram (EMG) of the upper extremities in response to the motor cortex stimulation was inhibited by hard hand pressure on base of the ear lobe and lumbar perivertebral region and by electrical stimulation of these regions. Similar inhibition was produced by electrical stimulation around the brachium conjuctivum and locus coeruleus (BC-LC) and the reticulogigantocellular nucleus (NRGC). Inhibition of the flexor muscle EMG due to hard pressure on the body parts was abolished by electrical lesioning of the BC-LC and NRGC. The light pinch with hand on the restricted abdominal region did not inhibit the flexor muscle EMG induced by the motor cortex stimulation in normal condition, while such stimulation inhibited the flexor muscle EMG in the ulcer suffering animals after treatment with cysteamine. This inhibition was not influenced by destruction of the NRGC. From these results, it was concluded that inhibition of the motor cortex induced-flexor muscle activities caused by light pinch stimulation of the restricted abdominal region, as the model of the voluntary finger flexion inhibition in O-ring test, was produced by spinal reflex inhibition.",

One of the many unique aspects of Tibetan medicine is urinalysis used not only for its clinical value but also for prognosis. Urinalysis is based on clinical observation and theoretical knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to present a basic guideline of the 9 clinical characteristics of urine temperature and show how such variation in these characteristics has clinical significance. Major clinical features of urine associated with specific diseases like malignancy, asthma, osteoarthritis and cholelithiasis are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In many cases of chronic intractable pain without any discernible causes, when both Western medical treatment and acupuncture treatment failed to eliminate the pain, this pain is often due to the unrecognized presence of viral or bacterial infection. Even effective anti-viral or bacterial agents often fail to eliminate or inhibit the infection, as these drugs may also fail to reach the most painful area where often unrecognizable circulatory disturbances co-exist. Using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification Method, we were able to localize substance P and thromboxane B2 (a good indicator of the presence and degree of circulatory disturbances) in the painful area along with virus or bacteria. Based on the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test localization method for specific substances or microbes, the author has successfully treated cases of chronic intractable pain by the combination of anti-viral or bacterial agents with either manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture or transcutaneous electrical stimulation through a pair of surface electrodes. Among a variety of infections, the most common cause of severe intractable pain was herpes simplex virus, and the most common bacterial cause of intractable pain of moderate degree was campylobacter. In addition, chlamydia was a very common cause of mild intractable pain. When peripheral nerve fibers are hypersensitive from nerve injury due to viral infection, in addition to the drug therapy for infection, use of Vitamin B1 25 mg., 2 times a day for an average adult often accelerates recovery time. As an anti-viral agent for the herpes virus family, the author found that EPA (Omega 3 fish oil, Eicosa Pentaenoic Acid, C20:5 omega 3), at doses between 180 mg. and 350 mg (depending upon body weight) 4 times a day for 2 to 6 weeks, without prescribing the common anti-viral agent Acyclovir, often eliminated the symptoms due to viral infection including all well-known types of the herpes virus, such as herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are usually not associated with intractable severe pain, but they are often associated with a recurrent burning or itching sensation and they can cause intractable frequent muscle twitching. Viruses belonging to the herpes family almost always exist between the midline of one side of the spinal cord and the midline of the front of the body where these nerves from the spinal cord end and the same virus is localized only on one side of the body at the same spinal level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This is done by intraosseal injection of 0.5 to 1.0 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution during a period of 3 to 5 seconds. Craving for alcohol and depressed mood, strongly manifested Alcohol Abstinence Syndrome (AAS) symptoms before osteoreflexotherapy, were reduced in a most convenient and fast manner under the influence of two sessions of osteoreceptive stimulation. The withdrawal symptoms caused by alcohol abstinence decreased markedly during the first two hours after the first osteoreflexotherapy treatment, continued to decrease in the next 24 hours and by the time the second osteoreflexotherapy session was given, the withdrawal symptoms completely disappeared in 72 hours. The most slowly and least reduced AAS symptoms were asthenia and disturbances of postular equilibrium. Based on clinical observations, it is speculated that osteoreceptive stimulations destroy ethanol dependent functional systems and restore the neurophysiological and neuromediatorial integration of the brain in alcoholismpatients. Primarily because of these two cited factors, the patient can be freed of the craving for alcohol for several years, and he or she also does not suffer from depression.",

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases result from strong or prolonged stress. Prolonged stress is a series of milder stressors acting through small intervals of time, which allows their negative effects on the body to accumulate. A series of milder stressors (prolonged stress) led to the onset of the chronic disease and only a series of very mild stressors (acupuncture treatments) done on a daily basis 14 to 20 days in a row could heal the chronic disease through accumulation of the positive stimulation effect of each treatment. This article uses the nonequilibrium theory of Prigogine to explain that the healing of chronic diseases is difficult and unpredictable in principle. If the series of acupuncture treatments need to be repeated, the acupuncturist shouldn't be blamed for this because the healing is unpredictable in principle. This makes essential the early detection and prevention of chronic diseases. For early detection, pulse diagnostic was used in ancient times, pulsographs in modern times, and the patients' complaint about 'moving pain' could be used for this. This article offers a nonlinear mathematical model allowing computerized-measurements for early detection of oncoming chronic disease, which is a glimpse to the preventive acupuncture medicine of the future.",

    "abstract": "This author began to have backache and also noticed that one side of the heel of the shoe was rapidly diminishing and his back began to bend forward. Because of this, before sleeping, he put a large, flat, wooden board above the bed and after covering the wooden board, with soft sheet, he began to sleep on this board every night. He noticed that after he started using this flat, wooden board, he began to wake up every night every 2.5~3 hours without urinary tract infections. Since other people noticed that the author seemed to be walking with his body bent forward instead of straight, he examined the effects of inserting one small soft pillow under his back. Suddenly, he noticed that frequency of waking up during sleeping reduced to half. But when he slept again without placing additional pillow, his painful leg cramps &amp; frequent urination returned. Eventually, we found very simple solution of keeping continuous sleep without frequent waking up in the middle of the night due to frequent urination or leg cramps by simply changing regular, soft pillow from horizontal position to vertical position so that both back of head &amp; back of part of the chest will be covered using same one pillow. We were able to reproduce similar effects with other people. Concerning the physiological mechanism, using Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT; received US Patent for non-invasive diagnosis in 1993), we can determine non-invasively any abnormal parts of the body or identifies if anyone bent their body forward, BDORT of entire body became most undesirable strong negative (-)6~(-)12 value with marked reduction of Thymosin α 1 &amp; Thymosin β 4 , while when the back is kept straight, BDORT is beneficial positive (+)6~(+)12 value with significant increase in both Thymosins. Undesirable similar BDORT strong negative (-)12 response was detected when any person slept on most of the bed with one positive pillow, but changing soft BDORT (+) pillow from horizontal position to vertical position reaching lower end of scapular bone or most of thoracic vertebra made BDORT strong positive (+)12, which can be obtained also by optimal dose of essential, nutritional substance (i.e. optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 which has 10 unique, beneficial effects) is taken. Therefore, treatment of any disease with combined use of vertically placed BDORT (+) pillow &amp; optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 during sleep is highly beneficial, since both methods significantly increased the release of Thymosin α 1 (which has powerful anti-cancer &amp; anti-inflammatory effects) and Thymosin β 4 (improves the cardiovascular system) significantly.",

A number of studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may modulate a wide range of neuro endocrinological factors following stimulation of acupoints. We aim to examine the effect of acupuncture treatment and plasma levels of ADH, melatonin hormone and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) on nocturia patients. 28 healthy women subjects (Group I) and 27 women nocturia patients (Group II) have been joined to our study. Following a total of 10 acupuncture sessions has been applied with two sessions per week, we took blood samples from the nocturia patients (Group III). Plasma antidiuretic hormone, melatonin and TAC levels were studied by Elisa method. As a result, all of the patients responded to acupuncture treatment positively. In our study, patients with nocturnal polyuria (Group II) showed significantly low plasma antidiuretic hormone and melatonin levels in comparison to the Group I(p&lt;0.001). Although plasma melatonin levels showed an increase by 12.35% in Group III in comparison to Group II, plasma ADH levels did not change between the two groups. Thus, it was concluded that melatonin could be beneficial for nocturia via central nervous system effect. Patients with nocturnal polyuria (Group II) plasma TAC level showed a decrease when compared with the control group (Group I). However, the plasma TAC level decreased by 9.83% following the 10th session in Group III in comparison to Group II (p=0,044). Based on our results we concluded that acupuncture treatment has a regulatory effect on plasma melatonin levels in patients with nocturia and can be used in the treatment of nocturia patients.",

    "abstract": "333 Acupuncture has been used in treating obesity even before 1975. Effect mechanism and beneficial effects of acupuncture treatment are unclear. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are harmful by-products of human body metabolism. The oxidative effects of ROS are neutralized by the antioxidant capacity. Thiols are substantial antioxidant agents and found in cysteine amino acid. Cysteine residues form disulfide bridges, predictor of oxidant stress. Thiol-disulfide homeostasis is an important parameter associated with several disorders such as cardiac, endocrine, neurologic diseases. To date, the effect of acupuncture on oxidative stress and thiol–disulfide homeostasis in obese individuals has not yet been examined. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of acupuncture for weight control on dynamic thiol–disulfide homeostasis. A total of 101 subjects who were being treated for weight control at our center (89 women and 12 men, body mass index (BMI) ≥22.48) were randomly enrolled in this study, and treated with ear &amp; body acupuncture. Body acupuncture is given manually. Ear acupuncture is given with a needle embedded within adhesive tape through performing acupressure by the patients three times per day. We measured the levels of thiol, any organic compound containing –SH group. Reduced thiol was represented with native thiol (-SH). Oxidized thiol (-S-S) was represented by disulfide. Total thiol was composed of sum of the native thiol and disulfide levels. We analyzed the differences between baseline BMI, blood native thiol, total thiol, and disulfide levels, and those after 10 weeks of acupuncture treatment. After acupuncture treatment, significant body weight and BMI reductions were observed. Mean body weight decreased significantly from 78.66±12.66 kg before treatment to 74.46±11.29 kg after treatment (p&lt;0.001) and mean BMI decreased from 29.54±3.99 kg/m 2 before treatment to 27.98±3.68 kg/m 2 after treatment (p&lt;0.001). Mean native thiol and total thiol levels increased significantly after acupuncture compared to before acupuncture. Disulfide levels insignificantly decreased. This is the first study to demonstrate that the beneficial effects of acupuncture in treating obesity are associated with improvements in thiol–disulfide homeostasis, an imbalance in which is associated with oxidative stress. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the mechanism or signaling pathways involved in the effect of acupuncture on obesity.",

In the present retrospective study, patients with post-chemotherapy perianal infection were monitored, and the perianal infection rate and clinical features of perianal infection were determined. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test, and the influencing factors of post-chemotherapy perianal infection in patients with acute leukemia were evaluated using logistic analysis.&lt;br&gt; Results: A total of 24 patients (9.88%) with acute leukemia suffered post-chemotherapy perianal infection. Age, basic perianal disease (hemorrhoids) history, constipation, diarrhea, duration of agranulocytosis, and length of hospital stay were compared among the patients. Perianal disease classification, perianal ultrasound, colonoscopy, postoperative pathology, and other clinical data were compared and discussed in relation to the occurrence and development of the disease. The results showed that there were no significant differences in perianal infection degrees between genders and among different types of leukemia (p &gt; 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in age, pain score, minimum white blood cell count, deficiency duration, and length of hospital stay among patients with different degrees of infection. The Spearman rank correlation test showed that the perianal infection degree was positively correlated with the highest hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level (p &lt; 0.05). The difference was statistically significant; the higher the maximum hs-CRP/procalcitonin levels, the more serious the perianal infection.&lt;br&gt; Conclusions: Perianal infections are common in the procession of chemotherapy or myelosuppression.

Methods: Extracted the perioperative acupuncture treatment records from surgical departments from January 2015 to December 2020 through the Information Management Center of Qilu Hospital. Diagnosis, primary disease, and the department applying for perioperative acupuncture treatments were extracted from their medical records. Frequency of perioperative acupuncture treatments from each department, diseases treated by acupuncture, and primary diseases were counted. The number of acupuncture treatments were counted though the Lianzhong Digital Medical Record Retrieval System of the hospital and effectiveness was evaluated according to the course of disease. Results: There were 10,152 perioperative acupuncture treatments from 17 surgical departments with 43 wards. Each ward had at least one request for acupuncture treatments every month, and the utilization rate of acupuncture increased year over year. The top five departments with the highest number of requests for perioperative acupuncture treatments were the gynecology department, orthopedics department, neurosurgery department, general surgery department and urology department. Acupuncture was mainly used to promote gastrointestinal function (50%) and nerve function (39%), followed by promoting recovery of bladder function (6%) and other diseases existing in the perioperative period (5%). The effectiveness is recognized by patients and surgeons. Conclusion: Acupuncture has been widely used in postoperative rehabilitation and can go further. The treatment of perioperative conditions is an opportunity for the development of acupuncture in general hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Globally, cerebrovascular events, commonly known as strokes, remain a significant health concern, presenting formidable challenges to neurologists across the nation. These strokes, responsible for a substantial number of fatalities, often lead to a debilitating condition known as Upper Arm Hemiplegia. Poststroke, effective rehabilitation is crucial for enabling individuals to regain their independence, particularly within the confines of their homes. However, the modern therapeutic options and features available can be challenging to access due to financial constraints and the overwhelming number of patients in need. In response to these challenges, there is a pressing need to leverage cutting-edge pneumatic technology to develop a portable device that can address these limitations. This paper introduces a novel, pneumatic-driven, wearable forearm device designed to optimize arm kinematics. This innovative wearable empowers patients, enabling them to regain control and dexterity in their fingers, thus improving their ability to perform daily activities. The pneumatic-actuated device consists of a compact upper arm miniature cylinder, controlled by advanced solenoid valves, all orchestrated by Arduino controller. This home-based rehabilitation device is not only small and lightweight but also boasts impressive power capabilities. Utilizing the latest trends in technology, the results of a sample subjected to the Fugl Meyer Assessment demonstrate the effectiveness of this portable device as an invaluable tool for home-based rehabilitation, ushering in a new era of stroke recovery.",

    "abstract": "Accuracy of the widely used organ representation areas, currently used in different schools of foot and hand reflexology was evaluated using Bi-Digital O-Ring test resonance phenomenon. Our previous study indicated that mapping organ representation areas of the tongue using Bi-Digital O-Ring Test resonance phenomenon between 2 identical substances often provided more reliable clinical information for both diagnosis and treatment than the 2 widely used, but crude, traditional schools of Chinese tongue diagnosis. This same method was applied for the mapping of the organ representation areas on the feet and hands. We succeeded in mapping the following areas on human feet: 1) Middle (3rd) toe on the sole side represents the following starting from the tip: A) Head, B) Face with eye, ear, nose, and mouth (1st Digit) C) Neck and organs within the neck (narrow band of space between 1st crease after the 1st digit and crease at the junction of the beginning of the sole); 2) 2nd and 4th toe represent upper extremities, the beginning tip being fingers and hands. The crease at the base of these toes represents the shoulder. The 2nd toe represents right upper extremity, and the 4th toe represents left upper extremity; 3) 1st and 5th toes in both the right and left feet represent lower extremities with the tip being the toes and soles of feet. The crease at the base of these toes represents the inguinal area. The 1st toe of each foot represents right lower extremity, and 5th toe represents left lower extremity. The sole of the foot is divided into the following 3 distinctive sections. 1) Upper (1st) section represents organs in the chest cavity including 2 thymus glands, trachea, 2 lungs, with the heart between them, and with the esophagus appearing as a narrow band outside of the lung near and below the 1st and 2nd toe depending upon the individual. Chest section occupies the first 1/3 to 1/5 (on a relatively long foot) of the entire sole. The boundary between the chest and G.I. system can be approximately estimated by extending the length of the entire toe or up to 25% longer to the sole, but it can be accurately determined using a diaphragm tissue microscope slide as a reference control substance. 2) Middle (2nd) section represents Gastro-Intestinal system, including lower end of the esophagus, liver, stomach, spleen, gall bladder, pancreas, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, appendix, colon, and anus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "A pressor blood pressure response was elicited by strong electric shock stimulation of the front paw in rabbits anesthetized with chloralose and urethane, immobilized by gallamine triethiodide and maintained by artificial ventilation. The pressor response showed a gradual decline in 3-4 successive trials. Naloxone or TCTAP, a specific mu receptor antagonist, administered intraventricularly (icv) at that time could facilitate the pressor response (n = 8, P < 0.02; n = 7, P < 0.01), suggesting the involvement of mu receptors in the declination of the pressor response. Electroacupuncture could inhibit the pressor response (n = 7, P < 0.01), and the inhibition was readily blocked by TCTAP (n = 7, P < 0.01). No obvious changes were observed in the normal saline control group. The results suggest that acupuncture is able to inhibit the pressor response via the activation of the opioid peptidergic system, of which the mu receptor is an important component.",

Acupuncture treatment was applied to the 22 volunteer migraine patients. The acupuncture treatment consists of 5 sessions with 2 sessions per week. Blood samples have been collected before performing acupuncture, after the 1st session and after the 5th session of the acupuncture. And for the control group blood samples were collected only once. A total of 44 participants were included in the study, and 24 of whom were diagnosed with migraine. The total thiol, native thiol and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels in the serum were measured in all patients and healthy individuals. The dynamic disulphide bond and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels were calculated from these values. The total and native thiol levels of migraine patients participating in the study were found to be significantly higher than the total and native thiol levels of healthy individuals. The total thiol, native thiol, and dynamic disulphide bond levels, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) were correlated with attack frequency, pain intensity, or migraine type. Thiol-disülfide homeostasis can play roles in the etiology and severity of Migraine.",

Both ancient texts and modern clinical reports have shown that moxibustion at CV8 alleviates exercise-induced fatigue. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of action is still unclear. Objective: To investigate the effect of moxibustion on mitochondrial energy metabolism in skeletal muscle of fatigued rats. Materials and Methods: In this study, rats treated with moxibustion for 8 weeks to assess its efficacy in enhancing energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), prohibitin-1 (PHB1), FoF1-ATPase and mitochondrial morphology of the biceps femoris were analyzed to explore evidence of moxibustion in long-term exercise. Results: Our research indicated that moxibustion could reduce the levels of biceps MDH, PHB1 and FoF1-ATPase in fatigued rats, and increased SDH and ATP levels. The electron microscopy showed that the mitochondrial morphology in the untreated and non-acupoint groups swollen, the cristae either decreased or fractured, but the degree of CV8 group was significantly lower than the other two groups. Conclusions: Moxibustion at CV8 relieves motor fatigue by regulating the energy metabolism of skeletal muscle and is a safe and effective non-drug treatment.",

However, even if there are no visible abnormalities in the organ representation areas, the author found that when the individual is using excessive Steroid Hormones for malignant brain tumors, other medical purposes, and competitive sports, not only did the left ventricle and pancreas become very abnormal when examined by the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, and Steroid Hormone accumulate in these organs with abnormally increased 8-OH-dG & TXB2, and Folic Acid & Telomere markedly reduce, but also the organ representation areas of the pancreas and left ventricle on the face showed similar abnormalities. Thus, using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, one can quickly and non-invasively screen the Steroid Hormone induced abnormalities of the heart and pancreas, and their organ representation areas of various parts of the body, including the face, tongue, ears, hands and feet. For malignant tumors including brain tumors, acupuncture on True ST. 36 or ST. 37 was found to be highly beneficial by reducing cancer cell telomere to practically 0, while increasing normal cell telomere moderately. The author's study over the past 15 years indicates that photographs of the human body, including pictures that appear in newspapers and magazines, have almost identical information as the information taken directly from the body surfaces of patients or individual athletes. Some examples of the application of this principle for the noninvasive estimation of the presence of Steroid Hormones using a photograph of the individual receiving the Steroid Hormone for medical reasons, or for the purpose of gaining an advantage in competitive sports, are shown in this article. While excessive Steroid Hormone use damages the heart and pancreas and hides symptoms of infection, additional use of Vitamin C also inhibits antibiotics and antiviral agents and cannot control severe infection, as suspected in the cases of late Pope John Paul II and late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.",

When abnormality was found in the bifurcation area of the common carotid artery by the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test,\" there were always abnormal findings of the area of the brain where circulation was coming from either one or both of the anterior or middle cerebral arteries. When abnormal \"Bi-Digital O-Ring\" response was found at the vertebral artery and posterior cerebral artery representation point, discovered by the author, at the side of the 6th cervical vertebra (corresponding to the entry point of the vertebral artery into the transverse foramen), the areas of the cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem where circulation is coming from the posterior cerebral artery, basilar artery and vertebral artery were also abnormal. Most of these abnormalities were found to be associated with problems of the cervical vertebrae and spastic muscles of the neck and shoulders and are often reversible. In this study, the author was able to differentiate abnormal brain circulation of any major branch of arteries in the brain due to organic changes or functional reversible changes by relaxing these spastic muscles and improving the circulation of the neck and shoulder area by giving either manual acupuncture, massage, or transcutaneous electrical stimulation. This in turn often improved brain circulation. If it was a functional abnormality, within a few minutes after one of these procedures the \"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test\" usually showed normal response or improvement. However, if it was an organic abnormality, the abnormality remained. When the supra-orbital arterial blood pressure at both sides of the forehead decreases below 40 or 30 mmHg, most patients develop so-called \"Cephalic Hypotension Syndrome,\" which is characterized by sleep disturbance pattern; difficulty in concentration; easy forgetfulness of recent events; irritability; decreased pain threshold with or without depression; spastic skeletal muscles, particularly the neck, shoulder and back areas. All of these symptoms can be explained by decreased circulation to the Nucleus Raphe Centralis Superior (controls sleep and waking pattern), Nucleus Raphe Magnus (serotonin & modulation of pain), Nucleus Reticularis Giganto Cellularis (controls muscle tone), etc. in reticular formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In 1984, the author first developed a simple, quick, non-invasive, economical method of detecting cancer in specific internal organs, using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT), with a microscope slide of specific cancer of a specific internal organ as a reference control substance. The detection rate for cancer screening was much greater than with any standard diagnostic tests. When imaging was performed using the BDORT, the area of positive response to the cancer positive slide was often much greater than the actual size of the cancer itself. This was due to the fact that most of the cancer tissue of the lungs or digestive system contained viruses such as HTLV-3 (often found in adenocarcinoma of the lung, stomach, head of pancreas, and colon) or HTLV-1 (often found in small-cell carcinoma of the lung and certain types of leukemia). The extent of the virus positive area was often far greater than that of the cancer tissue itself and was distributed in a much greater area surrounding the cancer. For this reason, the virus alone showed a response which could be mistaken for cancer tissue. The author succeeded in differentiating the exact location of cancer tissue itself from surrounding cancer related virus (with or without other microbes) positive area by using a pair of identical microscope slides with the same cancer tissue. One of the slides was exposed to ultra-violet rays (peak wavelength of 253.7 nm mercury vapor atomic resonance spectral line) for 40 seconds-4 minutes. After this exposure, the BDORT response to the virus (with or without other microbes) associated with the cancer tissue was completely eliminated, while the response to the cancer tissue was maintained. Using an ultraviolet exposed cancer slide, the imaging of the part of the body which responded to this virus-free cancer slide indicated the actual location of the cancer tissue, which was often confirmed by standard X-ray or other imaging methods when the thickness of the tumor was relatively large. These cancers detectable by standard laboratory tests had strikingly weakening response to the BDORT (-3.5 and -4), with ultra-violet exposed cancer slide as well as for antibody of Oncogen C-fos. The smallest size of cancer tissue detected by this method was less than 1mm in diameter in the very early stage of the cancer, which usually cannot be detected by current laboratory tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The principal factor in deciding on the investigation was the observation that when patients returned the equipment--because they failed to benefit--after having had it at home for a month or two, hardly any of the consumable material supplied had been used. In order to evaluate this observation quantitatively, TEN stimulators were handed out fitted with timing devices that clocked up the hours of operation. Of a total of 151 patients investigated, 86 responded to TENS after regular use for several months. The remaining 65 patients failed to obtain adequate relief. An analysis of the meter records showed that only ten patients of this group had used TENS on a regular basis. Consideration should be given to means of improving patient compliance in the future.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture and moxibustion have long been an integral part of Far Eastern oriental medicine. Moxibustion and acupuncture cannot be discussed without each other since both use the same acupuncture point locations and nomenclatures. In the late 17th century, the famous travel diary of Basho, a Japanese master of haiku poetry, made reference to personal use of moxibustion on one of the well-known acupuncture points, stomach 36. Recently, the author found 2 paintings of a 17th century Kyoto geisha house and its surroundings in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, painted in realistic color by Moronobu, the originator of the Ukiyoe style and a contemporary of Basho. Part of the scene depicts some professional porters at work; on their legs are white scars at some of the well-known acupuncture points, including stomach 36 and spleen 6. The scars appear to be the result of moxibustion. This may indicate the common use of moxibustion on well-known acupuncture points of the lower extremities in late 17th century Japan for professional porters and for people making extensive journeys. Further support of the relatively widespread use of acupuncture and moxibustion is even found in the popular, non-medical literature of late 17th century Japan. In one of the short stories about the life of average people, written by the novelist Saikaku, the details of a young woman giving moxibustion on the back of a young man is realistically described with illustrations. Reports written by some of the foreign physicians who visited Japan during this period were published, describing these methods with illustrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A surgical removal of the tumor, 14 days post-inoculation resulted in 61% of deaths compared with 90.0% of deaths in the sham operated control. By the addition of the thermo-moxibustion therapy, the mortality rate, in the surgically treated group was reduced to 37.5%. Surgical removal of the tumor mass at day 17 post-inoculation resulted in 70% death while surgery supported by thermo-moxibustion protected the animals to the range of 40% death. Surgical removal of the tumor mass followed by local heterologous immuno-therapy was very effective when applied 14 days post-inoculation (12.5% death only). However, the same procedures applied at day 17 post-inoculation were not effective (80% death). Surgery and moxibustion together were more effective than surgery alone. Surgery and immunotherapy were very effective when applied from day 14 post-inoculation. Thermo-moxibustion as the sole treatment was effective when applied either before or very close to the tumor cell inoculation (35% of death and 33% of death respectively, as compared to 61.7% death in the control). Thermo-moxibustion applied before and after tumor cell inoculation was more effective (15% death rate). Thermo-moxibustion either alone or in conjunction with surgery is a contribution to the protection of BALB/C mice against the early and the late development of mouse mammary carcinoma.",

Vastus lateralis (part of quadriceps) muscle loaded in a simple isokinetic exertion test was used as a model. Twelve, well trained athletes served as study subjective to minimize the inter-individual variations. They went through one-minute test with isokinetic device at the range of 90 degrees extension and flexion at the level of their maximal force. The myoelectrical signals were registered from middle of the vastus lateralis muscle by a computerized fast Fourier transform analyzing system based on 80286 and 80287 microprocessors and using surface electrodes. Mean power frequency (MPF) was 65.6 (SE=Standard Error, 1.6) Hz, median frequency (MF) 55.8 Hz and zero crossing rate (ZCR) 92.5 (SE 1.5) during first performance. All these parameters decreased apparently linearly and significantly from the beginning of the test (P<0.001). The decrease rate of ZCR was fastest and MF slowest. The area of power spectrum (PSA) was 1753 (SE 320) units during first performance, and it increased markedly with slightly accelerating rate during the test. In conclusion, for the evaluation of the muscular performance during the development of fatigue it is beneficial to monitor simultaneously MPF, MF and ZCR.",

Ten right-handed basketball players (age group 18-28) were included in the study. Grip strength was measured with a Riester hand dynamometer and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test successively, after the players had looked at the drawing of a \"crying face\" for 5 seconds from a distance of 40 cm at the eye level. Immediately afterwards they were shown the drawing of a \"smiling face\" and were asked to grip with the same condition. Once all 10 players carried out this experiment, the order in which the drawings were shown was reversed. We then proceeded to measure the same variables, using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. The statistics obtained thereby were subjected to Pearsons correlation coefficient and paired t-test. Using a hand dynamometer and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, it was found that, in both tests, the \"smiling face\" drawing (first crying, then smiling face: with hand dynamometer, it increased from 8.34+/-0.97 kg to 9.18+/-0.9 kg; t=5.39,p=0.0001) increased the grip strength of the basketball players, and the \"crying face\" drawing (first smiling face, then crying face: with hand dynamometer it decreased from 9.35 +/- 0.90 kg to 8.51+/- 0.96 kg; t=9.81, p=0.0001) decreased the grip strength. Exposure to the smiling face drawing increased the grip strength, and exposure to the crying face decreased it, in every subject tested in this group.

When there are cardiovascular problems, some of the heart representation areas of these areas often show the following changes: 1) Most distinctive visible changes such as the initial whitening with or without long white hair, then hair loss and complete disappearance of the hairs of the heart representation area of \"Eyebrows\" 2) Invisible biochemical changes that happen in heart representation areas at the \"Left Upper Lips\", 3) \"Nose\" below eye level as well as 4) \"3rd segment of Middle Finger of Hands.\" Most distinctive visible & invisible changes are found in heart representation areas on the \"Eyebrow\", located nearest to the midline of face, where the color of the hairs becomes white compared with the rest of the Eyebrow. Then the cardiovascular problem advances, and hair starts disappearing. When there are no hairs at the heart representation areas of the Eyebrow, usually Cardiac Troponin I is increased to a very serious, abnormal high value. Most of the cardiovascular representation areas of the face show, regardless of presence or absence of visible change. When there is a cardiovascular problem, not only simple Bi-Digital O-Ring Test can detect without using any instrument in several minutes but also, corresponding biochemical changes of abnormally increased Cardiac Troponin I level can often be detected non-invasively from these Organ Representation Areas of Face & Hands, although changes in Eyebrows, L-Upper Lip & 3rd segment of middle fingers are clinically the most reliable changes & easy to identify the locations. Manual Stimulation of Hand's heart representation areas often eliminated acute anginal chest pain before medical help became available. Important factors for safe, effective treatment of heart disease & cancer were also presented. Significant beneficial effect of optimal dose of Vitamin D3 400 I.U. for average adult on heart, brain and cancer, and harmful effect of widely used 2000 I.U., was emphasized.",

    "abstract": "As one component of the Chinese medicine meridian system, the meridian sinew (Jingjin, tendino-musculo) is specially described as being for acupuncture treatment of the musculoskeletal system because of its dynamic attributes and tender point correlations. In recent decades, the therapeutic importance of the sinew meridian has become revalued in clinical application. Based on this theory, the authors have established therapeutic strategies of acupuncture treatment in Whiplash-Associated Disorders (WAD) by categorizing four types of neck symptom presentations. The advantage of this new system is to make it much easier for the clinician to find effective acupuncture points. This study attempts to prove the significance of the proposed therapeutic strategies by analyzing data collected from a clinical survey of various WAD using non-supervised statistical methods, such as correlation analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. The clinical survey data have successfully verified discrete characteristics of four neck syndromes, based upon the range of motion (ROM) and tender point location findings. A summary of the relationships among the symptoms of the four neck syndromes has shown the correlation coefficient as having a statistical significance (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05), especially with regard to ROM. Furthermore, factor and cluster analyses resulted in a total of 11 categories of general symptoms, which implies syndrome factors are more related to the Liver, as originally described in classical theory. The hypothesis of meridian sinew syndromes in WAD is clearly supported by the statistical analysis of the clinical trials. This new discovery should be beneficial in improving therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is found in a majority of people we tested. Once Borrelia Burgdorferi (B.B.) spirochete enters human body, it not only causes pain by infecting joints, but it also often enters the brain and the heart. Infection of brain can be quickly detected from the pupil and infection of the heart by ECGs non-invasively. By evaluating recorded ECGs of atrial fibrillation (AF), using U.S. patented non-invasive highly sensitive electromagnetic field (EMF) resonance phenomenon between 2 identical molecules or between a molecule and its antibody, we examined 25 different AF patients' ECGs and found the majority of them suffer from various degrees of B.B. spirochete infection in SA node areas, also in the right & left atria, and pulmonary vein near and around its junction at left atrium & lesser degrees of infection at the AV node & His Bundle. When B.B. infection reaches over 224-600ng or higher at these areas, AF often appears in the majority of all AF analyzed. In order to develop AF, the 4 abnormal factors must be present simultaneously: 1) B.B. infection must be increased to 224-600ng or higher, 2) Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) must be markedly reduced from normal value of less than 4ng to over 100-400ng, 3) A significant increase of Cardiac Troponin I from normal value of less than 3ng to over 12ng and 4) Taurine must also be markedly reduced from normal value of 4-6ng to 0.25ng. These 4 changes were mainly found only at infected sites of the SA node area, both atria and between the end of the T wave & the beginning of the SA node area, which corresponds to U waves at recorded ECG. Origin of the U wave is mainly due to abnormal electrical potential of pulmonary vein at L-atrium. If all 4 factors do not occur at the infection site, no AF will develop. In seemingly normal ECGs, if using this method, one can detect invisible B.B. infection in early stages. Long before AF appears, AF can be prevented by improved treatment with Amoxicillin 500ng 3 times/day + Taurine 175mg x 3 times/day, with or without EPA 180 mg & DHA 120 mg, to avoid serious current limitations in the use of Doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day, for 4 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Most of the present knowledge on pain pathways is based on invasive animal experiments. In 1987, using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, Omura found that pain pathways can be evaluated non-invasively in living humans. In this paper, actual examples of such cases are reported. When mild pain was created by pinching different fingers of a normal human subject by placing a plastic clamp on the skin above a pain pathway, the indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, through a fine electroconductive metal wire held by a third person, showed marked weakening of muscle tone of the third person resulting in the opening of the Bi-Digital O-Ring, which was preselected only when the minimum essential requirements to perform the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test were satisfied. The pain pathway thus detected had the following characteristics: For example, when the lateral side of the 5th finger of the left hand was pinched, the pathway was approximately along the ulnar nerve and then went to the dorsal root of the spinal cord around the area corresponding to the lower end of the 7th cervical vertebrae/upper end of the 1st thoracic vertebrae. At this level, the pain pathway goes to the opposite side (right side) then laterally up to the lower one-third of the medulla oblongata. It then turns horizontally from the right side to the left side at the same level, then goes up in the left side of the center of the medulla oblongata. At the left side it goes to the pons, and in the upper part of the pons it turns towards the midline. It then goes up and turns to the right side of the right cerebral cortex corresponding to the lateral side of the 5th finger.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Current study was conducted to analysis the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture on 3 acupuncture points from lower limb meridians in the treatment of RLS.&lt;br/&gt; METHODS: A total of 7 MHD patients (5 Male and 2 Female) in our center with severe RLS symptom were enrolled. After one month of pharmacological washout period, patients received 12 sessions of electroacupuncture on three acupoints (Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Taichong (LR-3)) during HD. Severity of RLS symptoms and the sleep quality were evaluated by IRLSSG and ISI scores for 3 times (before, after and 1 month later of the electroacupuncture treatment).&lt;br/&gt; RESULTS: The average age of enrolled patients was 52.6±8.9 years, with median dialysis duration of 3.0 years. The hemoglobin level was 125.9±22.9 g/l. The IRLSSG score was significantly lower after electroacupuncture treatment (9.4±3.9) than that before treatment (17.3±4.7) ( P &lt;0.01). Both overall severity of RLS symptom average daily severity and frequency were significantly improved after electroacupuncture. It is also validated that the electroacupuncture treatment was contributed to sleep improvement in RLS patients after electroacupuncture treatment was discontinued for one month.&lt;br/&gt; CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture on three lower limbs acupoints during MHD was as a safe and effective treatment for attenuating the symptoms of RLS and improvement of sleep quality in hemodialysis patients, and the therapeutic effect maintain for at least one month.",

One of them measured the temperature of the skin covered by the cup, and the other – the temperature inside the cup.&lt;br/&gt; Results : In variant I at the beginning of the test the temperature of the interior of the cup was 48.4°C, and of the skin inside the cup was 40.3°C. The difference between the temperature inside the cup and the temperature of the skin was therefore 8.1°C, i.e. 16.7%. In variant II, the temperature of the inside of the cup and of the surface of the skin were similar and amounted to 42.2 °C and 43.9 °C respectively. It means that right after applying the cup, the body temperature in the place of its application increased by 7.3°C, i.e. by 19.8% in relation to the normal body temperature.&lt;br/&gt; Conclusions : The experiment that was carried out allows us to claim that the applied vacuum therapy affects the tissues by two factors: vacuum pressure and heat, and that is why the hot cup should be considered more effective in the therapy than the cold cup.",

Yin and Yang depend on the acidity and alkalinity of the internal and external liquid of cells caused by the human body after ingestion of food or influenced by the environment. Traditional Chinese medicine can help the human body adjust the acid-base balance, which is to say, adjust the imbalance state of Yin and Yang. The structure of functional active groups determines the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and the structure can be predicted by using the principle of topology to play a role in the treatment of the corresponding target.",

    "abstract": "Today, brain attack disorders are one of the most life-threatening areas in the medical era, which mankind is facing nowadays. Globally, more than 10,000,000 people are subjected to brain attack disorders like hemiplegia and tremor, every year, where two-thirds of them survive. Among the survival community, more than 80 per cent of them are subjected to long-term impairment of their upper extremity. In order to treat the impairment, the survival group is subjected to medications and rehabilitation in order to improve their daily living. But the facilities are very limited in fast- developing countries like India when compared to western standards. The rehabilitation given corresponding with medications during the treatment period in hospitals does not give a complete recovery from disability. People from rural background could not meet their rehabilitation requirements even in the hospital during treatment and also when they are discharged to home after treatment from hospitals due to financial constraints and reachability. In order to motivate the survival group to fulfill their daily living and improve their lifestyle, this paper is focused on intelligent home-based rehabilitation system at low cost, reliability, and affordability. One major movement disorder namely Upper Arm Hemiplegia was taken into account and visited few major hospitals around Coimbatore and Chennai for literature and case study. The facilities available in various hospitals and their drawbacks were analyzed. Based on the studies conducted at hospitals and taking advice from therapists, an innovative low-cost home-based rehabilitation device using Electro-Hydraulic systems has been developed to support patients who were used to impaired living even after treatments. To support Upper Arm Hemiplegia patients, the devices which were developed and experimented to hold different functionalities are discussed in this paper.",

The present clinical investigation aims to evaluate the clinical effect of pressing needle on nocturnal enuresis in children through a randomized controlled clinical trial. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 children with nocturnal enuresis were randomly assigned into pressing needle group, desmopressin group and pills Capsule group, 40 cases in each group. The children in pressing needle group were treated with pressing needles, and those in the desmopressin group and Suoquan pills were orally administrated with desmopressin and Suoquan pills, respectively. Combined behavioral therapy was also given in all the three groups during the treatment. Enuresis frequency, degree of arousal, functional bladder capacity (FBC) and postvoid residual urine volume (PRUV) were employed as the indicators to evaluate the clinical efficacy in the three groups. After 6 months of follow-up, the recurrence rate of the three groups was also analyzed for efficacy assessment. Results: The total responsive rate in pressing needle group was 95.0%, which was higher than 87.5% of Suoquan pills group (p &lt; 0.05), and significantly higher than 77.5% of desmopressin group (p &lt; 0.01). The frequency of enuresis was significantly lowered after treatment (p &lt; 0.01), concurrently with an evident improvement in arousal levels in all of the three groups (p &lt; 0.01), and the inter-group difference in post-treatment enuresis frequency and arousal level between pressing needle group and the other two groups was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). The recurrence rate of pressing needle group, desmopressin group and Suoquan pills group was 7.89%, 48.39% and 22.86%, respectively, with a difference which was statistically significant between pressing needle group and desmopressin group (p &lt; 0.01), but not between pressing needle group and Suoquan pills group (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Pressing needle treatment showed a substantial clinical effect on enuresis in children by improving the bladder function, increasing the FBC and reducing PRUV of the bladder, as well as by enhancing the degree of arousal and lowering the recurrence rate, therefore is suggested to be considered as an option for enuresis treatment for children.",

Materials and methods: The experimental groups consisted of three concentrations of matrine (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL). The DC maturation was detected by flow cytometry. The proliferation of T cells was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method. The secretions of cytokines by CTLs were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The specific killing capacity of CTLs to target MKN45 gastric cancer cells was detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Results: The results showed that matrine could increase the expressions of CD86 and CD83 in a dose-dependent manner. Matrine could promote T cell proliferation ( P&lt;0.05 ). Moreover, matrine also significantly increased the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70), respectively ( P&lt;0.05 ). The therapeutic vaccination with DCs vaccine treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus matrine resulted in improved killing effect as compared to that observed with DCs treated with LPS alone (P&lt;0.05 ). Conclusion: These findings define matrine as an immune adjuvant that enhances the DC activation and demonstrate a new pharmacological approach to improve the therapeutic effect of autogenous DC vaccines.",

Methods: There were 150 laryngopharyngeal reflux patients enrolled and divided into three groups randomly, with 50 cases in each group. Patients in group A were treated with the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) lansoprazole. Patients in group B were treated with lansoprazole combined with Banxia Houpu decoction, and patients in group C were treated with acupuncture treatments and a combination of Chinese and Western medicine. The reflux symptom index (RSI), reflux finding score (RFS), and quality of life (36-item short form health survey questionnaire) were assessed before and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Results: The RSI and RFS scores of the three groups were significantly reduced after treatment (P &lt; 0.001). In group B and C, they were lower than in group A at 8 weeks (P &lt; 0.01). The SF-36 score of 3 groups increased after treatment. At both 4 and 8 weeks (P &lt; 0.001), and patients in groups B and C scored higher than patients in group A (P &lt; 0.001). The total effective rate of group B and group C was higher than that of group A (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: All three treatments have therapeutic effects on the disease, but the efficacy of a PPI alone is not as good as the combined treatments' efficacies. Moreover, PPI combined with Banxia Houpu decoction and/or acupuncture treatment substantially affects life improvement.",

The methods used in this research are as follows: systematically retrieving China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Biological Medicine Database, Cochrane Library, Medline and Embase were electronically searched from inception to Dec 2020. The dataset included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with Chinese and English only that compared acupuncture as an adjunct to rehabilitation in stroke patients with fatigue. The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Statistical analyses were performed by RevMan V.5.4.A total of 6 RCTs were included in this study, including 426 cases (213 cases in the treatment group and 213 cases in the control group). The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with conventional treatment, acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy can significantly reduce the incidence of post-stroke fatigue [MD = -5.45, 95% CI = (-6.75, -4.14), Z = 8.19 ( P &lt; 0.001)]. In terms of energy, acupuncture also has an obvious effect [MD = 1.69, 95% CI = (0.27, 3.12), Z = 2.33 ( P &lt; 0.02)]. Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture combined with conventional rehabilitation therapy is an effective therapy for patients suffering from post-stroke fatigue, which is suitable for clinical promotion and use. However, due to methodological weakness and limited number of RCTs, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Further clinical trials with large sample sizes and a rigorous design are needed.",

Pain artificially induced by non-coherent intensive light (wavelength of 500nm-1200nm) impulse has not been studied yet. In this study this technique was applied to statistically correlate the brain activity under induced pain while particular acupuncture points (yanlingchuan of both feet, GB34) were stimulated by intensive light impulses. The brain electrophysiological signals or electroencephalogram (EEG) at F(p1), F(p2) were recorded. The data of brain waves showed a distinguishable raising slope in this study. Intensive light beam impulse with beam diameter of 10 mm and intensity of 14 joule/cm2 was applied to the acupuncture points. In order to quantify the pain effects, a pain intensity function was defined based on the induced pain activities related to the collected data. The pain intensity function and its equations were used to analyze the changing rate of pain with respect to stimulated intensity and pain momentum transport activity. The results showed that the area of the brain wave evoked by pain could be used as pain perception indicator. The raising slope at one brain side was relatively higher when the acupuncture point GB34 at the contralateral side was stimulated.",

Although shape of the ECG does not change significantly regardless of whether metal rings are on or not, when rings are on, the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test evaluation of trace of ECG revealed vulnerable period of rising part T-wave of ECG waves (which correspond to the left ventricle and AV node) become abnormal with increased Cardiac Troponin I. DHEA in various parts of the body reduced significantly and maximum decrease in DHEA was found when metal ring was on the left 4 th and 5 th fingers. Telomere reduced with each of the 5 fingers, but the 2 nd , 4 th , and 5 th fingers produced the maximum reduction of telomere. When metal ring was inserted onto the left 1 st finger and left 2 nd finger, Cardiac Troponin I did not change significantly. Additional abnormality was found when patients with cancer wear metal ring(s), and both Cardiac Troponin I and cancer parameters, such as Integrin Î±5Î²1 and Oncogen C-fos Ab2, increase anywhere between 4Â-12 times. However, when the ring was cut, creating a 1mm or longer empty space, no increase in cancer markers and Cardiac Troponin I were observed. Similar findings were found with metal bracelets.",

We compared the neuropharmacological effects of 6 main Kampo formulations (1. Mao-to: MA HUANG TANG; 2. Shimbu-to: ZHEN WU TANG; 3. Ninjin-to: REN SHEN TANG; 4. Shigyaku-san: SI NI SAN; 5.

Shimbu-to showed a tendency to increase CNV in 90 minutes after oral administration. Shimotsu-to also induced a transient tendency to increase CNV in 60 minutes after oral administration. Keishi-to showed a decrease of CNV in the early stage of the experiment, while Ninjin-to and Shigyaku-san showed no changes of CNV. From these, it may be concluded that Mao-to and Keishi-to induce sedation of brain function, but Shimbu-to and Shimotsu-to show activation, while Ninjin-to and Shigyaku-san show no changes of brain function regarding CNV related brain function. Furthermore, the time courses of CNV changes were different within the same group (sedation or activation) of Kampo formulations.",

Experiments with animals have demonstrated that the irritation of osteoreceptors by electric pulses leads to osteoreceptive response potentials of the same parts of the brain (Deiter's nuclei, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, cortical motor centre etc.) which participate in the regulation of animal and human posture and other motion acts. Close functional relations have been established between the skin, bone, vestibular and muscle sensory systems in the brain structures where the osteoreceptive excitation converges. The studies of osteoreceptive sensory system have served as a theoretical base for new techniques of posture stabilization. These are based on osteoreceptive irritations caused by electrical pulses or by intraosseal pressure increase at injections of the physiological solution. It has been found that each bone has its own specific role in posture regulation. In all cases of bone irritation the posture stabilization of various degrees has been confirmed. However, it has been demonstrated that the most effective results have been obtained by affecting the processus spinosus of seventh cervical vertebra and the lower extermity bones, especially those of tibiae and calcaneus.",

    "abstract": "1 During the 1st day of European Congress for Integrative Medicine held September 9-11, 2016, almost the entire 1st day was scheduled for the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, which was originally developed by this author, &amp; consists of 2 main parts for which a U.S. patent was issued in 1993. One is a non-invasive, detection of various molecules using very strong Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Resonance Phenomenon between 2 identical molecules with identical weight. Using this strong EMF Resonance Phenomenon, most molecules &amp; microorganisms can be detected rapidly and non-invasively without directly contacting patients. We measured the HPV-16 infection of 70 participants non-invasively in the first 30 minutes, then screened cancers for 40 volunteers who completed one page \"Mouth, Hand &amp; Foot Writing Form,\" which took an average of 5∼10 minutes for each person to complete. Screening of 75 common cancers was made in 2-5 minutes for each patient. Analysis of 40 volunteers revealed 32 persons had some malignancies including 5 Anaplastic Astrocytomas of the L-brain, 3 Multiple Myelomas, 7 Hodgkin's Lymphomas, 8 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas, 2 rectum cancers (with chief complaints of worsening Irritable Bowel Syndrome). Although everyone had HPV-16 infections between about 6,000ng &amp; 250ng, malignancy could not be found among those who had less than 1,200ng. Our individualized safe, effective and economical treatment of various cancers consists of optimal doses of Vitamin D 3 with or without Taurine and/or PQQ depending on the positive synergetic compatibility among these 3 substances as normal parts of human tissue. The most serious 2 cases of rectum cancer with multiple metastasis, we confirmed very significant anti-cancer effects of their optimal doses of vitamin D 3 , which is increased to 800~1,000 I.U. (due to advanced cancer with multiple metastasis instead of the usual 400 I.U. for average adults). The unique 7 beneficial effects of optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 (also Taurine or PQQ) include: 1) significant Anti-cancer effects without side effects; 2) marked decrease in DNA mutation as decreases in 8-OH-dG; 3) marked urinary excretion of Viruses, Bacteria, Fungi, &amp; Toxic substances, including Asbestos &amp; metals; 4) marked increase in Acetylcholine in the brain &amp; the rest of the body; 5) marked increase in DHEA; 6) marked decrease in β-Amyloid (I-42); 7) marked decrease in Cardiac Troponin I. Optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 is clinically most important for cancer, ischemic heart, and memory problems. Optimal dose of Taurine is 150∼175mg and PQQ is 5-7.5mg and should be taken 3-4 times a day, depending on the patient. Medications and supplements including excessive Vitamin C (as well as multivitamins) but also inhibited optimal doses of Vitamin D 3, Taurine &amp; PQQ. Often coffee, drinks containing high Vitamin C content (e.g., some green tea &amp; orange juice), &amp; multivitamins as well as pain medicine (e.g., Oxycodone), strong EMF from cellular phones, and strong negative BDORT underwear often completely eliminate the above beneficial effects of Vitamin D 3 and promote growth of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we succeeded in the mapping of organ representation areas of different organs of the body on Thymus gland representation areas. Entire internal organ of the body was found to be represented upside-down position on the Thymus gland located on the manubrium (with the exception of upper &amp; lower extremities) which has 2 lobules and one at each side of the manubrium. Internal organs of right side of the body is represented on the left side of the Thymus gland and the left side of the body is represented on the right side of the Thymus gland. At all the normal parts of the body, Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) is (+) value between (+)1~(+)12. Using highly sensitive electromagnetic field (EMF) resonance phenomenon between 2 identical molecules or tissues with identical weight of BDORT, which can identify any molecules, specific cancers, viruses, bacteria, or fungi non-invasively &amp; is the main part of BDORT (US Patent was given to BDORT in 1993). Using BDORT, any organ in the body when they are normal, it is (+) value and best (+) value is (+)12, while there is an abnormality, its value is (-) &amp; the worst is (-)12. According to the BDORT, Thymus gland is the only exception in the body where the normal average value is (-)2 &amp; normal value is between (-)2 &amp; (-)5. (-)5 is the best active condition they can reach and corresponding to (+)12 of rest of the body. When any parts of the Thymus gland are (-)1.5~(+)1, (+)1 corresponds to the worst abnormal condition (-)12 of the organs in the rest of the body and we often find malignancy or some other serious medical problems. Therefore, we can use Thymus gland BDORT grading for non-invasive, quick, detection of cancer &amp; other serious medical problems. For effective treatment, we found 6 simple methods of increasing Thymus gland function to their maximum condition of (-)5 which in turn corresponding organ in the body becomes strong, positive maximum value of up to (+)12 without using any medication with exception of taking optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 , when patient has significant lack of Vitamin D 3 .",

Our technique can control the acupuncture needle temperature safely and appropriately. We designed a solenoid-type electrode and a 150-kHz high-frequency electromagnetic generator. Regarding the system performance, we found that the time required to reach 42 °C is only 52 seconds compared with traditional acupuncture combined moxibustion method which takes 150–270 seconds. In addition, we conducted a pilot study involving 20 participants to examine the possibility of clinical application. We performed manual acupuncture and TCA on the LI9, LI10, and TE5 acupoints, and only the acupunctures of TCA group were heated using the developed system at 38–40 °C. In addition, we measured the hand-temperature and blood-flow velocity before and after stimulation to determine their variability. The hand temperatures increased after stimulation in both groups, but only the TCA group exhibited a significant difference ( p =0.001). The blood-flow velocities of the two groups exhibited different patterns. The blood-flow velocity was increased by 6.3 % for the TCA group ( p =0.114), but decreased by -12.78 % for the manual acupuncture group ( p =0.011). We found that this new method is not only safe and convenient, but also precise and effective. Moreover, an electromagnetic field has various therapeutic effects and, thus, may induce its own positive benefits.",

The C57BL6 mice were divided into control, model and PC6 groups randomly. The myocardial ischemia (MI) model of mice was established by forced exhaustive swimming (ES). EA at PC6 was performed to the PC6 group for 7 days. The Electrocardiograph (ECG) was recorded before ES and immediately after ES on the 1 st and 7 th day. The ECG J-point deviation value and heart rate (HR) were analyzed to evaluate the effect of EA. The β 1 AR and M 2 AChR knockout mice were used to explore whether β 1 AR and M 2 AChR in the cardiac myocytes mediated the cardioprotection effect of EA. The β 1 AR knockout (β 1 AR-/-) and M 2 AChR knockout (M 2 AChR-/-) mice were divided into MI model and PC6 groups respectively and treated the same way corresponding to the groups of C57BL6 mice. The results showed that the Electrocardiograph (ECG) J-point deviation value in C57BL6 mice were significantly increased after MI ( P =0.015 in the model group, P =0.001 in the PC6 group), which is a symptom of MI, while the heart rate (HR) on the 1 st decreased significantly ( P &lt;0.05, or P &lt;0.01). Following EA in the C57BL6 mice, the J-point deviation on the 7 th day was significantly decreased ( P =0.031, decreased 70.05%), but the HR was still much slower than their baseline (both P &lt;0.01). The increased J-point deviation value and decreased HR level were also observed in both β 1 AR-/- and M 2 AChR-/- mice ( P &lt;0.05, or P &lt;0.01). While no significant changes were found in the J point deviation after EA intervention on the 7 th day, and in HR of the both types of mice. These results suggested that EA at PC6 could protect the myocardium against ischemic injury, probably mediated by myocardial β 1 AR and M 2 AChR.",

    "abstract": "Catgut implantation at acupoints (CIA) has been applied as medical treatment for autoimmune diseases. Yet, its effect and mechanism of this therapy on autoimmune uveitis is still unknown. Here we aimed to explore the immunoregulatory effect of CIA in the experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) rat model. Lewis rats were induced with EAU by injecting IRBP1177 – 1191 peptide, and subsequently treated with CIA. In the CIA group, delayed mild inflammation was observed with alleviated infiltration of lymphocytes and ocular damage. Flow cytometry showed significant decrease in Th17 lymphocytes at Day 9, 13, and 18 post-immunizations ( P &lt;0.05) after CIA. The Th1 lymphocytes were also significantly decreased at Day 13 and 18 post-immunizations ( P &lt;0.05) in the CIA group. IL-17 and IFN- γ mRNA levels were notably decreased at Day 9, 13 and 18 post-immunizations (P &lt;0.05) after CIA. Serum IL-17 and IFN- γ levels in the CIA group were significantly decreased at Day 9, 13 and 18 post-immunizations ( P &lt;0.05). Ocular inflammation was markedly inhibited after catgut implantation at Pishu (BL20) and Shenshu (BL23) acupoints in the EAU-induced rats. In summary, this study revealed that CIA could reduce Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes and the expression of IFN- γ and IL -17 in the EAU rat model, suggesting its potential in uveitis treatment.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Organisms are constantly immersed in an ocean of electromagnetic waves which cause different effects on the body. At the end of 1980, it was determined that the frequency of 6.66 Hz is responsible for anxiety-depressive states and that all subjects who manifest such disturbances vibrate on this frequency. Materials and Methods : The BDORT technique was applied to evaluate parameters associated with the subject's status (Sirtuin-1, TERT, TP-53, Zoloft, Thromboxane B2, Acetylcholine, DMAE, Thymus Gland). Furthermore, the GAP- 7 and HAMD psycho-aptitude tests were applied to evaluate the subject's anxiety-depressive level. At the end of the evaluation, the subject was treated with the OPFT (Opposite Phase Frequency Treatment), i. e., with the counter-phase frequency of -6.66 Hz, in order to cancel the 6.66 Hz frequency. The treatment was performed by listening, with headphones, to the specific anti-frequency, elaborated thanks to the combined use of artificial intelligence software. Results: Patients treated with the OPFT showed an increase, measured by BDORT, of specific biological parameters and a decrease in Thromboxane B2, in accordance with expectations, due to the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The data obtained, on the specific parameters, showed a statistically significant correlation (ρ &lt; 0.005 ** and ρ &lt; 0.001 ***). Discussion: The increase in the value of parameters Acetylcholine and the decrease in Thromboxane B2, was the basis of the alleviation of anxiety-depressive symptoms. As a corollary of them, there was an increase in parameters such as Sirtuin-1, TERT, and TP-53. Conclusions: The OPFT technique proved to be effective in reducing anxiety depressive symptoms in all treated subjects.",

Methods : A total of 69 post-stroke hemiplegia patients with muscle spasm who were hospitalized in the Department of Encephalopathy Rehabilitation, Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were selected as the research participants. The randomized controlled clinical trial design method was used, and they were randomly divided into the basic treatment group and the combination treatment group. The basic treatment group did not use acupuncture treatment, but only basic rehabilitation treatment. The combination treatment group was treated with opposing needling combined with eye acupuncture therapy. Both groups were treated once a day, and two days were rested after five days of continuous treatment. Five days were a course of treatment, and a total of three courses were treated. The efficacy of opposing needling combined with eye acupuncture therapy for treatment of muscle spasm in post-stroke hemiplegia patients was evaluated. The clinical neurological deficit score scale (CSS), modified Ashworth spasticity scale (MAS), simplified Fugl-Meyer scale (FMA), Barthel index scale (BI) and total score were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Results : There was no significant difference in CSS scores between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05). After 19 days of treatment, the CSS scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in MAS scores between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05). After 19 days of treatment, the MAS scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in FMA scores between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05).

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a common complication secondary to tibial plateau fractures (TPFs) after internal fixation. Early continuous passive motion (CPM) and needle-knife therapy are both alternative medicine treatments that have been beneficial to PTOA. CPM and needle-knife therapy are commonly applied separately in the treatment of orthopedic diseases and soft tissue injuries, but they both have limitations. In this study, we combined CPM and needleknife therapy to observe its efficacy on PTOA caused by postoperative TPFs and its possible mechanisms. A rabbit model of TPFs after internal fixation was established by surgical method. Rabbits were randomly divided into five groups: Normal control (NC) group, Sedentary (SED) group, CPM group, Needle-knife group, CPM + Needle-knife group. Range of motion (ROM), knee diameter and medial cartilaginous surface of the tibial plateau were observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in the supernatants from knee joint fluid, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The gross view of ligament tissues was detected by immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The gross view of ligament tissues was detected by histomorphology, including Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Other than that, the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Finally, the apoptosis of ligament cells was assessed through DAPI and TUNEL assay. Our data showed that ROM was reduced while knee diameter was increased in the SED group, but they were relieved by CPM and needle-knife—either singly or in combination treatment. CPM and needle-knife therapy also improved the effect of TPFs on other parameters, including the medial cartilaginous surface of the tibial plateau improvement, MMP-13 and TIMP-1 expression in the medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL), knee joint fluid IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, and condition of ligament cells apoptosis. Our findings suggested that early CPM plus needle-knife therapy might be a useful and promising therapeutic method for PTOA.",

    "abstract": "An attempt is made by the author to show that biorheology and certain of its branches are expected to contribute towards a better understanding of mechanisms concerning beneficial effects known in the practice of acupuncture. Rheology, a branch of physics, founded as an organized science in 1929, is defined as the science of deformation and flow of matter. Biorheology comprises the science of deformation and flow of biological systems or of materials of biological significance. Recently, the author considered biorheology to be the missing link between the life sciences. Hemorheology, at present its most active branch, is concerned with the rheological (deformation and flow) properties of blood, including its cellular and plasmatic components, and of the structures of the vessel wall with which blood and its components come into direct contact. Hemorheology is the study of how the components of blood and of the vessel wall can function and interact rheologically. In 1981, the author defined the entity of the blood and its more or less leaky envelopes, the variety of blood vessels in a variety of tissues and organs, as an organ, named the 'vessel-blood organ'. It is a special organ penetrating all other organs and can be likened to some extent to the nervous system. Hemorheology is thus the rheology of the vessel-blood organ, its constituents and of the processes involved in both its two portions as well as in their interactions. There is an extension of hemorheology, termed recently by the author 'parahemorheology', which deals with processes and flow occurring within the interstitial spaces, across the parenchymal cell membranes, the lymph and the channels or lymphatics, in which it is contained, and its walls. Thus parahemorheology is intertwined with hemorheology. Applications of biorheology to the theory and practice of different fields in medicine is called medical or clinical biorheology. It is expected that clinical hemorheology and clinical parahemorheology are of particular significance in research on acupuncture. Such considerations have thus far not been taken into account in studies of mechanisms pertaining to acupuncture. It is obvious that biorheological processes occur in patients as a result of acupuncture, for example the release of muscular spasm. The crucial barrier in transcapillary transport is considered by the author to be the endoendothelial fibrin(ogenin) lining. Fibrinogenin is the term for the aggregation and gelation of fibrinogen without thrombin participation. The field of electro-biorheology is closely associated with parahemorheology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

If the arterial pulse analyzer is adopted for use in Oriental medical clinics, there will no longer be a need for manual pulse palpation. In brief, applying the arterial pulse analyzer to the 8 key pulses of Oriental medicine yields the following results: 1) 'Slow' or 'rapid' pulses can be defined by the S-S interval (almost identical to the R-R interval of the ECG). 2) 'Slippery' or 'hesitant' pulses can be defined by the S-P time and the Dh/Ch% (P time & Incisura) ratio. 3) 'Floating' or 'submerged' pulses can be defined by the Ph/Ch% (pressure pulse wave to height) ratio. 4) 'Scattered' or 'moderate' pulses can be defined by the S-C- time (E time). Thus, by employing the arterial pulse analyzer, subjectivity problems inherent in the manual pulse palpation used by Oriental medicine for over 1500 years can be analyzed objectively.",

Using microscopic slides of different parts of the heart, we were able to image the outline of the heart as well as the SA node, AV node, tricuspid valve, mitral valve, aortic valve, pulmonary valve, coronary arteries, and aorta and its branches, including the vertebral arteries, without using any bulky or expensive imaging instruments. Using serotonin as a reference control substance on the different parts of the central nervous system, it was possible to demonstrate the 6 well-known raphe nuclei and the locus coeruleus (which contains serotonin & norepinephrine), as well as the distribution of serotonin in the cerebrum and the cerebellum, all of which closely resembled previously published well-known neuroanatomical structures and distributions of neurotransmitters. As an extension of this work, possible representations of different internal organs on the central nervous system were examined using microscopic slides of different internal organs as reference control substances. The results indicated that the entire heart is represented primarily in the medulla oblongata, and that the SA node and the upper half of the left atrium are represented in the caudal end of the pons; the right side of the heart (i.e. R-atrium, AV node, tricuspid valve, R-ventricle) is represented on the right side of the medulla oblongata, and the left side of the heart (i.e. lower half of the L-atrium, mitral valve, L-ventricle) is represented on the left side of the medulla oblongata, and the upper half of the left atrium is represented in the caudal end of the left side of the pons. The bottoms of the ventricles are located near the spinal cord. Furthermore, the right and the left sides of the heart are represented in specific areas of each side of the right and left hemispheres of the cerebral cortex, and there are connecting pathways between the representation areas of identical parts of the heart, through the corpus callosum and other neuro-pathways.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the importance of tongue diagnosis in Oriental Medicine, a very rough assignment of only a limited number of the major internal organs is known, and some of the assignments are not exactly the same, depending upon various schools of thought. In 1980, the author first developed a simple, quick, non-invasive, accurate method of localizing representation areas of internal organs, using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification Method based on the resonance phenomena between 2 identical substances or tissues, with a microscope slide of a specific internal organ as a reference control substance. The method was applied to the organ representation areas in the ears, hands, feet, cerebral cortex, and tongue. In this article for the first time detailed organ representation areas of the human tongue are being presented in comparison with currently known organ representation areas on the tongue. For convenience, the tongue can be divided into 3 parts: the anterior, the middle, and the posterior. On each side of the anterior part (1st part, area around the tip) of the tongue, the internal organs in the chest cavity are represented; from the mid-line to each side of the tip of the tongue, the oesophagus, thymus gland, lung (and trachea & bronchi), heart, and breast (over heart area) are represented. The middle (2nd) part of the tongue represents the digestive system, and the 3rd part represents the genito-urinary system. The 2nd part of the tongue represents the rectum, colon, cecum, appendix, small intestine, stomach, pancreas, liver, and gall bladder. The 2nd and 3rd parts of the tongue represent all the internal organs in the abdominal cavities and the genito-urinary area. The remaining one-third of the tongue, near the pharynx, is all related to the genito-urinary system with the exception of the spleen, which is located between the kidney and the adrenal gland representation areas. Within the triangular area formed by the sulcus terminalis, the anus is represented on both sides. Finally, at the peak of that triangle, i.e. the foramen cecum, the coccyx is represented. Extremities are represented at the sides of the tongue. The undersurface of the tongue starting from the tip of the tongue in the mid-line and going towards the root of the tongue along the frenulum in the mouth represents one kind of homunculus consisting of the neck, face, head, ears, upper & lower extremities and back of the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The quantitative parameters of the BEP--their square values and the sum of the square values of BEP recorded simultaneously from several points of the organism--were measured. The effect of low (1 Hz) and high (28 GHz) frequency electrical stimulation was studied. The stimulation of spleen, liver, stomach, small intestine and corresponding acupuncture points had the greatest effect on the quantitative parameters of the BEP in stomach and small intestine. During patient investigation, the most remarkable changes of the studied parameters were noticed in the BEP recorded from the acupuncture points of the affected internal organ meridians.

    "abstract": "In order to study functional as well as anatomical aspects of various internal organs, SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) has been used extensively for evaluation of these organs. For SPECT study, intravenous injection of radioactive substances such as technetium-99m (20 millicuries) & thallium-201 chloride (3 millicuries) is commonly used. Although the physical half-life of thallium-201 chloride is 73 hours, its biological half-life is often more than 3.5 times that. Following intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride it is concentrated in the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland, testes or ovaries, and then eventually decays to mercury. Because of its relatively long physical & biological half-lives, thallium-201 chloride may produce mild radiation injury while it remains radioactive. Similar injuries may be induced by technetium-99m (often used for brain SPECT), which radiates Gamma rays (140 KeV), but since its physical half-life is only 6 hours, the side effects are not as significant as those of thallium-201 chloride. Since the main component of thallium-201 chloride radiation is X-ray (68-82 KeV), which consists of photons with a very short wavelength and a high penetrating power, prolonged exposure can induce electromagnetic field-induced injury. As a previous study of the principal author on electromagnetic field exposure indicated, electromagnetic field-induced injury causes the change of L-amino acids to D-amino acids. 2 days after SPECT study of the heart with intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride, the principal author experienced shortness of breath, loss of appetite, dizziness, fever, and general malaise within the week, and found a progressively significant increase in D-glutamic acid and decrease in L-glutamic acid peaking 2 weeks after the initial injection but lasting for many weeks after in organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland & testes, where radioactive substances had accumulated and radiation was at an average of about 400 counts/min. Even 2 months after the initial injection, the abnormal ratio of D-amino acids and L-amino acids had not returned to normal (in the radiation exposed heart, L-amino acids: 6 mg/dl with D-amino acids: 5 mg/dl; normal tissue, L-amino acids: 10 mg/dl with D-amino acids < 1 mg/dl). The principal author tried to find a safe method of reducing possible radiation injury and accelerating the elimination of the already deposited mercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

All of the cases were seen to have a primary colonic dysfunction which has been described as Dysbiosis. It was assumed that the colonic dysfunction was due to abnormal intestinal flora and this was corrected by a repopulation of the bowel with normal commensals and the simultaneous stimulation of liver and pancreatic function. This resulted in all of the patients losing at least a number of their sensitivities and those who were on sublingual desensitization drops were able to stop these drops and tolerate the foods without any further problem. It has postulated that much of multiple food and chemical sensitivity is due to underlying causes of which Dysbiosis is one.",

    "abstract": "The basis of Akabane's method is the evaluation of latent periods (LPs) of heat pain in the fingertips skin where there are acupuncture channels. Each of these LPs is the period elapsing between the application of a heat stimulus and the caused heat pain. The evaluation allows identifying acupuncture channels lesions. Thereby, acupuncture treatment for many diseases may easily be prescribed. Unfortunately, the boundaries of reliability and the error of one measurement by this method have not yet been exactly determined. These circumstances do not allow the method to be improved. The purpose of this work was to overcome the above-mentioned problems. 47 healthy subjects were examined. LPs were determined 3 times with 20-minute interval. The patterns of changes in heat sensations during LP were also studied. Results: We defined by statistical investigation the LPs are valid in ranging from 6 to 55 seconds when the first measurement. The value of LP measurement error is increased during this period from ± 3 to ± 5.5 seconds in accordance with the formula of S-shaped curve. Re-measurement in 20 minutes at the same loci is not reliable. We confirmed the presence of the skin stable zones which differ in thermal pain sensitivity. We found wavelike changes of thermal sensitivity during heating with a half-cycle of 60-90 seconds when painful stimuli and 120-150 seconds when closely to pain. We have determined the ratio of LPs and the sensitivity states of the respective receptive zones are linear in the area of strong thermal sensations. This ratio may be named the generalized basic law of psychophysics since the Weber-Fechner law is its particular case. Conclusions: Akabane's method in its classic form is not significant because many LPs obtained by it are either very short or very long. However, using the LP errors and other regularities obtained by us it can be developed into significant. This will improve the examination of patients, specify and individualize their treatments, and will also allow the method to be used for scientific researches. In addition, the examination time will be reduced from 15-30 to 8-15 minutes.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a serious disease around the world. It is caused by genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression without changes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. The gene expression change is due to methylation on DNA. Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) uniquely classifies patients with asthma according to their symptoms. The present study is investigated to find a novel epigenetic marker of diagnosis for Korean asthma patients using Korean differentiation syndrome category in TKM. We recruited 62 patients with asthma from departments of respiratory medicine in hospitals. They are classified by symptom diagnosis and questionnaire to the deficiency syndrome (DS) group and excess syndrome (ES) group. And their DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. To investigate novel epigenetic markers on classification by Korean differentiation syndrome category, methylation analysis was performed using next generation sequencing (NGS), Agilent SureSelect Human Methyl-Seq which is a tool from Agilent Technologies company. In analysis of differential methylated epigenetic markers between the DS group and the ES group, total of 8 sites in exon region in [meprin (a cell surface glycoprotein), A5 antigen (a developmentally-regulated cell surface protein), and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase mu (MAM) domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 1] ( MDGA1 ) gene were considered to be closely associated with differentiation syndrome category in Korean asthma patients. The methylation within MDGA1 gene could be regarded as an epigenetic candidate marker for Korean differentiation syndrome category in Korean asthma patients.",

    "abstract": "Our study indicated that cancer can develop in very short time if there is a strong coexisting infection of HPV-16 and HHV-8 in the presence of strong repeated electromagnetic field. Recently the first author himself developed cancer by drinking eggnog, which happened to contain strongest infection of both these 2 viruses, in the presence of Electro-magnetic field. Sometimes these cancers can also appear as a small metastatic mass in the back of the finger or hand. These metastatic tumors that are appearing in the hand are often misdiagnosed as benign lipoma since they do not seem to create any pain or other symptoms. In this article we described 2 examples of such an unusual metastatic tumor appearing as if it is a benign lipoma. If left untreated, or biopsy or surgical removal of these metastatic tumors can be new sources of metastases or unrecognized existence of an advanced tumor of original organ without significant symptoms. These rapidly developed cancers are infectious &amp; difficult to treat. Fortunately, we succeeded in discovering an essential parameter required to completely inhibit these cancers by implementing the combination of the following 3 different methods given sequentially 1) Simultaneous Intake of Optimal Doses of Vitamin D3 (with 10 unique beneficial effects) every 8 hours &amp; white fleshed Dragon fruit (since we found it containing close to optimal dose of DHEA, Zinc, Magnesium, Lithium, and a small amount of Vitamin D3 etc.) every 24 hours; 2) Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method; 3) Manual Stimulation of the Thymus Gland Representation Area of the Back of Each Hand. When these 3 different methods are used consequently there is a possibility of safe effective treatment for hopelessly advanced cancer patients, if Thymosin α1 &amp; Thymosin β4 are both very significantly increased to 800ng or higher.",

    "abstract": "A completely healthy middle-aged female High School teacher developed stomach cancer 1 month after she spent several hours talking face to face with one person with serious stomach problem. Two months later she had surgical removal of stomach cancer. Our research confirmed that in the presence of coexisting strong virus infection of HPV-16 &amp; HHV-6 and strong Electromagnetic field, early stage of cancer can develop very rapidly within 24 hours and these rapidly developed cancers are infectious &amp; difficult to treat. Just before Thanksgiving Day (late November) the 1st author drank one full cup of Eggnog, at the same time he also ate part of Blueberry Pie. About 6 hours later the 1st author developed severe left low abdominal pain and diarrhea. Since he realized eggnog had extremely strong infection of HPV-16 and HHV-8 surrounded by strong electromagnetic field this might have caused early stage cancer and found the presence of early stages of 5 new cancers: 1) Hepatoma of liver 2) Hodgkin's lymphoma 3) Transitional Cell Carcinoma of Urinary Bladder 4) Adenocarcinoma of Pancreas 5) Adenocarcinoma of the Breast. All of these cancers did not exist before this unplanned accidental human experiment. In 2017 Pancreatic cancer and Breast cancer were found in the 1st author within 24 hours after 4 hours of medical examination of middle aged Japanese male patient with chief complaints of Breast Cancer &amp; Pancreatic Cancer in close distance. The patient also had strong infection of these viruses. The author was able to eliminate these 2 cancers completely a few months before drinking the eggnog. The other cancers were also developed under similar circumstances all of them were eventually eliminated, but all these 5 cancers did not exist before drinking eggnog. The eggnog had a very high concentration of about 10000ng of HPV-16 and HHV-8 and most of cancer tissue has over maximum infection of both viruses, 7000-11000ng. The reason we have been using optimal dose of Vitamin D3 every 8 hours for every cancer patient is we can continuously excrete cancer contributing viruses to much less than 6000ng since when viruses of HPV-16 &amp; HHV-8 are less than 6000ng, the cancer was less active. We could not eliminate the 5 infectious cancers in the first author in spite of our improved treatment with combine use of optimal doses of vitamins D3 &amp; white fleshed Dragon fruits (since we found it to contain near optimal doses of DHEA, Zinc, Magnesium, Lithium, and a small amount of Vitamin D3, etc.) Fortunately, on Dec. 8, 2018, for the first time in cancer treatment we succeeded in completely eliminating active cancer semi-permanently under specific conditions. In this study the second time author was able to semi-permanently inhibit all 3 cancers' activity. Through this process, we were able to detect the presence or absence of active cancer very accurately from 2-10 cc of urine or rapidly changing QRS complex of ECGs. In the subsequent 10 days no cancers were detected once Thymosin α1 and 3 Thymosin β4 reach very high value of 800ng measured using reference control substances.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the research is to determine whether there was synergism between mobile phone exposure and higher release and accumulation of mercury in tissues of the individuals with amalgam fillings. For this purpose, the computer electro-magnetic simulation and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) method were used. For the electro-magnetic simulation, the FIT method (Finite Integration technique - numerical simulation method for calculation elelctromagnentic fields in space, expecialy in body) was used and the results of the electric field and Specific absorption rate (SAR) in the tooth model with and without amalgam fillings were obtained. Specific absorption rate is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body when exposed to a radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field. It is dose for absorbed electromagnetic radiation which is dependent on frequency and can be associated with the adverse effect of tissue heating. Standards indicate SAR values that should not be exceeded. The numerical result of absorption electro-magnetic energy shows increased value of the electric field, magnetic field, induced currents and SAR in teeth with fillings. These results indicated the possible explanation of the increased release mechanism of the mercury (Hg) when using mobile phones. The Bi-Digital O-Ring Test method tested the levels of mercury in the body, liver, and urine in a group of examinees who had amalgam fillings and used cell phones. By using indirect BDORT we examined groups of examinees 10 with and 10 examinees without amalgam fillings. By using BDORT we measaured level ofHg in the body and urin samples in all examinees before exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of mobile phone and after 15 minutes of exposure of mobile phone EMF. The results showed significantly higher level of Hg in urin after exposure of EMF of mobile phone, only in a group of examinees with amalgam fillings. The results showed significant matches with some published papers by other researchers. These effects might cause potential organism disorders and represent secondary harmful effects of electro-magnetic radiation on the health of individuals. This approach throws a new light in clarifying the interplay of cellular electro-magnetic radiation and increased the release of mercury from the amalgam fillings. Increased toxic effects are imposed by themselves as possible.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among women worldwide. There are many risk factors for breast carcinoma, such as genetics, Electro Magnetic Field Radiation (EMFs), the presence of human papillomaviruses (HPV), BRCA mutations, low vitamin D level, and toxins. The risk of developing ovarian metastases increases with the passage of time after the breast cancer diagnosis, and there are significant links between the tumor stage and the development of ovarian metastases (expressed Mammoglobin B). Because there is no screening test for ovarian cancer proven to be effective, women need to learn about their personal risk for developing ovarian cancer. This is especially true for the women already diagnosed with breast cancer, who should make sure if they are at risk for ovarian cancer. By using BiDigital O-Ring Test (BDORT), originated by Prof. Omura, we can detect a lot of risk factors contributing to the risk for ovarian cancer, such as the presence ofHPV in the ovary, exposure to EMFs, food intolerance, low level oftelomeres, the presence of Borrelia Burgdorferi (BB), Tuberculosis (TB) etc. A high level of HPV 16 in the ovary that is located on the same side as breast cancer could be detected, in addition to a high level of Integrin aSpl, as a marker of carcinogenesis. The cervix region infected by HPV is connected with the presence of HPV on both breasts, while the infection of one ovary (either left or right) is connected with the diseased breast (with cancer) on the same side. We examined 38 patients with confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer, by using indirect BDORT and in all patients we found out one ovary with a high level of HPV infection as with high level of Integrin aSpl . There are some mutual factors for the carcinogenesis of breast cancer and ovary cancer (HPV infection, BB, TB etc., toxins, EMFs). All patients reported being exposed to EMFs. 29 out ofa total of 38 (76.32%) patients had the infection of one ovary and the same side breast where exist breast carcinoma. In the same time on same side ovary we detected high level of HPV 16 and 18 and high level of Integrin aSpl. In three of38 patients we found out increased ovary tumor markers. In study group we found out 29 out ofa total of38 patients have a risk of ovary carcinoma. What we can learn from related literature is that ovarian carcinoma occurring after breast carcinoma is usually the metastasis of breast carcinoma; however, after this research, we believe that, in most cases, ovarian and breast carcinoma develop simultaneously, stimulated by the same or similar factors, and possibly by the same carcinoma stem cell.",

Recently, it is reported that acupuncture has a beneficial influence on haemorrhoids. Thus, whether acupuncture is effective in the treatment of haemorrhoids is the key in this meta-analysis. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the treatment of combination of acupuncture and Chinese medicine in haemorrhoids by meta-analysis, which provide a scientific, effective and feasible evidence for clinical decision-making and practice. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager 5.3. All RCTs about combination of acupuncture and Chinese medicine versus Chinese medicine alone were selected and assessed for inclusion. The effective rate (ER), recurrence rate(RR), Symptom score before and after treatment (perianal edema, hemafecia, perianal pain, pruritus ani, prolapse of haemorrhoids) were the outcomes analyzed in this meta-analysis. 11 RCTs and 976 patients were included. The methodological quality of most included trials was low to moderate. In this meta-analysis, the clinical efficacy of combination of acupuncture and Chinese medicine was more effective than only Chinese medicine used in haemorrhoids. The effective rate [OR=5.24,95%CI(3.72,7.40), P&lt;0.0000I], recurrence rate [OR=0.29, 95%CI(0.11, 0.73), P=0.009], perianal edema [WMD=-0.74,95%CI-0.90 to -0.59, P&lt;0.00001], hemafecia[WMD=-0.78,95%CI-0.89 to -0.67.

There was about 96% of the clinical efficiency in the treatment of acupuncture plus Chinese medicine in haemorrhoids and 89% of that used in Chinese medicine alone, which indicates clearly that 7% higher efficiency in the experimental group compared with the control group. The treatment of combination of acupuncture and Chinese medicine in haemorrhoids is more useful than Chinese medicine alone applied in piles, which is shown in 91% of clinical effects in average.",

    "abstract": "Previous study indicated Human Papilloma Virus-Type 16 (HPV-16) has important role in genesis of ovarian cancer, uterus cancer, &amp; breast cancer. Omura, Y. noticed HPV-16 virus co-exists with single-cell parasite Toxoplasma Gondii (T.G.) infection in most of the cancer tissues he examined. Therefore, he thought some unknown virus must exist in the T.G. In early 2018, he found there is strong Human Herpes Virus-Type 8 (HHV-8) infection in every cell of Toxoplasma Gondii he examined. Thus, we found in every cancer cells there are co-existing cancer-promoting factors of HPV-16 &amp; HHV-8 infection associated with Toxoplasma Gondii. As a common source of these infections in human cancer patients, we found most egg yolk has co-existing HPV-16, HHV-8 &amp; Toxoplasma Gondii, but egg whites are free of these infections &amp; can be eaten safely as protein supply. Many cats and dogs also have these infections. As most important, safe treatment of cancer, we found repeated optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 with optimal interval of about 8 hours is ideal because of 10 unique, beneficial effects discovered by him. Individually determined one optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 has most effective anti-cancer effects in hopeless, advanced, cancer patients by reducing extremely high Integrin α 5 β 1 of over 1500ng to normal value of 0.002∼0.004ng and 8-OH-dG (proportional to DNA mutation which is required for cancer growth) of over 60∼80ng to normal value of 0.1∼0.25ng for average 8 hours and 6000∼9000ng of strong pathogenic infection of HPV-16 &amp; HHV-8 in cancer tissue reduced to safe range of less than 500ng by markedly increased urinary excretion. Concerning beneficial effect of optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 , all the previous studies failed to use individualized optimal dose. As a result, they could not properly evaluate beneficial effects &amp; side effects and many reports claimed there were no significant beneficial effects including anti-cancer effects. Although optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 can eliminate these viral infections very significantly but not less than 500∼300ng. Cancer incidence is only significant when these viruses are above 6000ng inside the body. Thus, we can keep potentially serious patients with strong cancer-contributing virus infections at relatively safe low degree of infection of much less than 3000ng. Our ideal treatment for advanced cancer patients is a combination of 1) Individually determined Optimal dose of Vitamin D 3 with optimal interval of about 8 hours, 2) Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method by manual stimulation organ representation area of pathological organs at hands, 3) Stimulation of Thymus gland representation area of the back of the hand which was discovered by Omura, Y. in 2017, &amp; 4) Identification &amp; removal of multiple co-existing cancer-promoting factors. This combination of 4 new methods of treatment was found to be most effective &amp; safe treatment for not only hopelessly advanced cancer patients but also many other difficult medical problems.",

    "abstract": "The stress response can be triggered during the perioperative period by tension, fear, anesthesia, surgical trauma, and various postoperative adverse stimuli, leading to significant changes in the endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems of patients. In particular, immunosuppression induced by the stress response has adverse effects on the postoperative recovery of patients. As acupuncture stimulation-related technologies have been rapidly developed and applied in recent years, a number of basic and clinical studies have confirmed that acupoint stimulation can regulate the immune system via local, neurological, and endocrine pathways. Moreover, acupoint stimulation treatment has also been shown to reduce the adverse effects of immunosuppression by affecting the release of various cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) 1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) β, immunoglobulins, complement proteins, and T cell markers such as CD3, CD4, and CD4/CD8 via the regulation of macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and endogenous opioids. In addition, acupuncture stimulation treatment during the perioperative period can also significantly decrease the amount of anesthetic required for anesthesia, effectively reduce nausea and vomiting, relieve post-operative pain, and accelerate the recovery of physiological functions. Therefore, acupuncture stimulation treatment has shown important potential for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "While a visiting Professor at the University of Paris, VI (formerly Sorvonne) more than 40 years ago, the Author became very good friends with Dr. Paul Nogier who periodically gave seminars and workshops in Paris. After the author diagnosed his cervical problem &amp; offered him simple help, Dr. Nogier asked the Author to present lectures and demonstrations on the effects of ear stimulation, namely the effects of acupuncture &amp; electrical stimulation of the ear lobules. It is only now, in 2019 that we have discovered 2–5 minute high frequency stimulation of the ear lobule inhibits cancer activity for 1– 4 hours post stimulation. Although the procedure is extremely simple. First take optimal dose of Vitamin D3, which has the most essential 10 unique beneficial factors required for every human cell activity. Next, apply high frequency stimulation to ear lobule while the worst ear lobule is held by all fingers with vibrator directly touching the surface of the worst ear lobule, preferably after patient repeatedly takes optimal dose of Vitamin D3. When the worst ear lobule is held between thumb &amp; index fingers and applying mechanical stimulation of 250 ~ 500 mechanical vibration/second for 2 ~ 5 minutes using an electrical vibrator, there is rapid disappearance of cancer activity in both the brain and rest of the body for short time duration 1 ~ 4 hours. The effect often increases by additional pressure by holding fingers. As of May 2019, the Author found that many people from various regions of the world developed early stages of multiple cancers. For evaluation of this study, U. S. patented Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) was used which was developed by the Author while doing his Graduate experimental physics research at Colombia University. BDORT was found to be most essential for determining the beneficial effects as well as harmful effects of any substance or treatment. Using BDORT, Author was the first to recognize severe increasing mid-backache was an early sign of pancreatic cancer of President of New York State Board of Medicine after top pain specialists failed to detect the cause after 3 years of effort, while the BDORT showed early stages of cancer whereas conventional X-Ray of the pancreas did not show any cancer image until 2 months after Author detected with BDORT. For example, the optimal dose of the banana is usually about 2.0 - 2.5 millimeters cross section of the banana. A whole banana is more than 50 ~ 100 times the optimal dose. Any substance eaten in more than 25 times of its optimal dose becomes highly toxic and creates DNA mutations which can cause multiple malignancies in the presence of strong electro-magnetic field. With standard medication given by doctor, patients often become sick and they are unable to reduce body weight, unless medication is reduced or completely stopped. When the amount of zinc is very high, DNA often becomes unstable and multiple cancers can grow rapidly in the presence of strong electromagnetic field. Large amount of Vitamin C from regular orange or orange juice inhibit the most important Vitamin D3 effects. At least 3 kinds of low Vitamin C oranges will not inhibit Vitamin D3. Since B12 particularly methyl cobalamin which is a red small tablet is known to improve brain circulation very significantly we examined its effect within 20 seconds of oral intake we found the following very significant changes. Acetylcholine in both sides of the brain often increases over 4,500 ng. Longevity gene Sirtuin 1 level increases significantly for short time of few hours. Thymosin α1 and Thymosinβ4 both increase to over 1500 ng from 20 ng or less.",

    "abstract": "Gastric ulcer is a common digestive system disease, which leads to the serious decline in the life quality and effective therapies are in urgent need. Midnightmidday ebb flow acupunctures including Najia and Nazi acupunctures have been applied in clinics in China for more than one thousand years and the acupoints are selected according to the time rhythm. Najia acupuncture, namely day-prescription of acupoints, divides ten days (one cycle) into 120 two-hour periods and each period is coordinated with a meridian. Meanwhile, Nazi acupuncture, namely hour-prescription of acupoints, divides a day(one cycle) into 12 two-hour periods and each period is coordinated with a meridian. When there is a disease in a certain meridian, the relevant acupoints are operated in the corresponding time. However, the comparative efficacies of Najia and Nazi acupunctures on promoting the healing of gastric ulcer are still unknown. In this study, gastric ulcer rats were induced by acetic acid and were randomly divided into four groups: non-acupuncture group, normal acupuncture group, Najia acupuncture group and Nazi acupuncture group. After different treatments for continuous 10 days, the gained weight, gastric ulcer area and the thickness of gastric mucosa were measured and analyzed. Decreased ulcer area, increased mucosa thickness and dense scar tissue occurred in the Najia group and Nazi group compared to that in the non-acupuncture group (P&lt;0.05). However, there were no significant differences between Najia and Nazi acupuncture groups (P&gt;0.05). Thickness of gastric mucosa in Nazi acupuncture group increased significantly compared to normal acupuncture group (P&lt;0.05). Therefore, the findings in this study indicated that Najia and Nazi acupunctures had gastroprotective effects and accelerated the healing of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer in rats, but no significant differences between them. It may provide valuable information for development of acupuncture for the treatment of gastric ulcer in clinics.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency therapy is an unconventional method, already applied for some time, with numerous results in numerous clinical pictures. Our group has developed a software, later called SONGENPROT-SOLARIS, capable of directly converting nucleotide sequences (DNA and/or RNA) and amino acid sequences (polypeptides and proteins) into musical sequences, based on mathematic matrices, designed by the French physicist and musician Joel Sternheimer, which allows to associate a musical note with a nucleotide or an amino acid. Innovation in our software is that, in the algorithm that defines it, a variant is directly implemented that allows the reproduction of sounds, phase-shifted by 30 Hz, between one ear and another reproducing the phenomenon of Binaural Tones, capable of induce a specific brain activity and also the release of particles called solitons. Thanks to this software we have developed a technique called MMT (Molecular Music Therapy) and currently, we are in the phase of applying the technique on a cohort of 91 patients, with a high spectrum of clinical pictures, examining the same, using the technique Bi-Digital-ORing-Test (BDORT), before and after treatment with MMT. Aim of project is to stimulate the expression of a specific gene (the same genetic sequence that the patient listens to, translated into music), only through the use of sound sequences. We have concentrated our attention on three main molecules: Sirtuin-1, Telomers and TP-53. The results obtained with BDORT, after treatment with MMT, showed a significant increase in the values of the three molecules, on all the examined patients, demonstrating the operative efficacy of the technique and the its applicability to numerous diseases. In order to confirm the data obtained by BDORT, we propose, with the help of an accredited laboratory, to perform epigenetic tests on the three parameters listed above, paving the way to understanding how frequencies can influence gene expression.",

    "abstract": "As Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (originated and founded by Prof. Y. Omura in New York, 1997-2020; follow as BDORT)is a diagnosis method that is carried out on the basic theory of the physiological phenomenon called the decline of muscular power of fingers, the examiner, and patients (or mediator) are demanded to do BDORT by constant regular power. Namely BDORT is a diagnosis method that estimates the relative muscular decline of the patients, so there is such a view that the results of BDORT are reflected by consciousness of the examiner. The authors used the ORT tester by using air system to avoid the influence of electromagnetic wave and evaluated the decline of the muscle strength and open degree of the O-ring shaped by the patients. Patients of the Shimotsuura Clinic are subjected and checked by direct BDORT method. When the patients shapes the O-Ring, staff members stimulated the parts of the body by plastic stick and push foot switch. Decline of the muscle strength &amp; open degree was evaluated. When the open degree was more than 20%, stimulated points were evaluated as abnormal. Opposite side arm of the O-Ring shaped arm was checked as control. The results of the direct BDORT method between ORT evaluation apparatus and the patient was consistent with the results of the indirect method of BDORT method between the doctor and the assistant. Even where the patients complain of ill, the muscle strength was declined and opened the O-Ring by using ORT evaluation apparatus. Especially in the parts of the strong response of Integrin α5β1 checked by the doctor, the muscle strength decreased and the open degree was much higher than other parts of the body. Patients could experience of BDORT by numeral objective evaluation of the decline of the muscle strength by using ORT evaluation apparatus.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to proce or disprove the widely held beliefs that X-ray radiation used in medical or dental applications may affect the normal oral flora, and may also have effects on the micro-organisms existing in the oral cavity of every person. Such beliefs might be due to the common knowledge that radiation therapy has been utilized for the long time in the cancer patients to destroy the cancerous cells, and that radiation are also widely used in agriculture to prolong the shelf life of the farm products by destroying the decay-causing microorganisms existing in the agricultural products such as meats, produce, etc. Since very few research has been conducted in this concerned area, and not much pertinent information in the scientific literature could be found in this regard, a research experiment was set up to find out if these common beliefs have any merits. The research experiment involved selecting BDORT(By-digital O-Ring Test) positive dishes to incubate human saliva collected from a volunteer patient. Once dish served as control which was not subjected X-ray irradiation. Other dishes were subjected X-ray irradiation with various doses of irradiation strength at various time interval such as 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 seconds to find out if any significant change taken place in the bacteria colonies. The bacterial colonies in the irradiated dishes then compared with that of the control dish so as to draw a conclusion if radiation for medical and dental X-ray machines would actually have any bactericidal or/and bacteriostatic effects on the oral micro-organisms flora. Finally, dishes were brought to a local hospital Radiology Department to use high dose of irradaition (used for cancer therapy) on the dishes to find out to what extent if such a high dose X-ray irradiation emitted from therapeutic cancer therapy machine would affect the number of bacterial colonies in the dishes as when compared with when dishes were under low doses of X-ray irradiation from dental or medical diagnostic X-ray machines. During the experiment, dishes, when irradiated, were sent to a certified medical technologist in the hospital laboratory to count the number of the bacterial colonies, and each change in the bacterial colony number were recorded in to data for biostatic analysis. The data were compared with BDORT negativity scores collected each time before and after dishes were irradiated, thus to find out if any corresponding confirmity between traditional laboratory findings and the score changes from BDORT findings. The results of this experiment revealed the fact that radiation from regular diagnostic X-ray machines possess little effect on bacteria, and that they have little effect on both cells and bacteria present in the human body. Neverthless, dramatically increasing the high radiation dosages does have potential to both inhibit and destroy bacteria. Therefore,using irradiation techniques to inhibit bacterial growth is only useful in agriculture practices, since tens of thousands of irradaiation dosages are necessary for bacteria inhibition. in human, over 500 RADs (radiation absorption dose) is lethal. Therefore, bacterial inhibition could not be practical in humans since it requires tens of thousands of RADs to be useful in the aspect.",

In this report we have mapped the organ representation area of the umbilicus and its surrounding areas of a healthy person by using BDORT. Then the abnormal organs around the umbilicus of the patients with certain diseases were mapped by using BDORT. Also Oncogene C-fos Ab2 positive response network (specially relation between the radial sulcus and the disease) of the cancer response (Oncogene C-fos Ab2) positive person were examined all over the body. In many cases, the radial sulcus from the umbilicus and the organ representation area of abnormal organs at the umbilicus of diseased person mapped using BDORT were highly correlated. Abnormality observed in a specific organ with strong resonance by BDORT meridian network was connected to the umbilicus. Mapped chart of the organ representation area surrounding the umbilicus is clinically very useful for non-invasive visual umbilical diagnosis.",

The gastric retention and intestinal transport were evaluated by carbon powder labeling and the expression of 5-HT in the cerebral cortex and ileum was detected by immunohistochemistry. Depression-like symptoms in rats can be relieved by EA therapy. For instance, the consumption rate of sucrose solution was higher, the total distance and central distance in the open field test were increased, and EA treatment could reduce the immobility time of these rats. Swimming, struggling and immobility latencies were also increased in the forced swimming test. After EA treatment, the expression of 5-HT in the cerebral cortex and ileum increased. Finally, we found that EA ameliorated ischemia, depression, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in ISO-induced MH rats, which may be related to 5-HT metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture, which is widely used as a complementary and alternative medicine, has been expected to be beneficial for the treatment of hypertension. However, the antihypertensive effect of acupuncture is still under debate. In the present study, the blood pressure induced by handgrip stress were evaluated using power spectral frequency analysis and hormone examination. This study, which recruited 6 normotensive participants, was designed as a randomized crossover trial of two interventions; electroacupuncture and sham-electroacupuncture. Intervention was delivered as 5 sessions over 2 consecutive weeks. The first electroacupuncture immediately before handgrip exercise did not affect the rates of increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Also, neither increase in LF/HF ratio, as sympathetic nerve activity, nor decrease in HF value, as parasympathetic nerve activity, by handgrip stress was significantly inhibited by a single intervention of electroacupuncture. In addition, 5 repeated electroacupuncture sessions did not attenuate the elevation of blood pressure after handgrip stress, and did not suppress the increase in LF/HF ratio and decrease in HF value. Also, electroacupuncture did not influence the changes in plasma concentrations of renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine after handgrip stress. No difference was observed in the rate of change in each parameter after handgrip stress between the electroacupuncture treatment group and the sham-electroacupuncture group. The present study did not show any suppressive effect on stress-induced response of blood pressure as well as sympathetic nerve activity. The obtained findings showed no beneficial effects of acupuncture on hypertension as a standalone therapy, consistent with suggestions by previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Research with larger sample sizes or higher-quality randomized controlled trials are expected, and a conclusion on the utility of acupuncture treatment for hypertension should be carefully made.",

The study design is cross sectionel study; included 46 participants of female sex who had experienced chronic pain for approximately six months. Beck depression scale was applied to both sexes with chronic pain. Acupuncture was applied in different numbers according to the severity of the pain and the reasons for the illness. Senses were first performed at intervals of once a week, then once a week, then every 15 days. Sessions lasted 20 minutes. In fact, a decrease of five units was considered clinically significant. Each patient was informed about the procedure before acupuncture and an informed consent was obtained. Before beginning the acupuncture sessions, each patient was given a participant number and the BDI was administered. The scale was discussed with each patient personally. The BDI consists of 21 questions, including questions about the participants's mood during the previous week.

In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) at Shangjuxu (ST37) on CaSR in colonic dysplasia mice, and to explore the possible mechanism of EA regulating colonic movement. The mice were injected with nicardipine or hexamethonium bromide to induce colonic dysplasia. Intestinal transit function was assessed by twelve hours fecal granules and fecal water content percentage, while colonic slow wave was assessed by multi-channel physiological signal acquisition system, immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscopy were used to examine CaSR expression in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of the mice. We found that the number of fecal particles, the frequency and amplitude of colonic slow wave were disrupted after nicardipine or hexamethonium bromide injection. In addition, CaSR expression in control group was mainly distributed in intestinal epithelial cells, and the morphological structure of mucosal layer was regular. Compared with control group, the structure of mucosal layer in nicardipine group and hexamethonium bromide group were all disorderly, the expression and fluorescence intensity of CaSR in nicardipine group were visible, but in hexamethonium bromide group were weakened. After EA intervention, these disorders were ameliorated, which suggested that EA at ST37 could therefore regulate colonic motility disorders via the involvement of CaSR.",

Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted in Beijing from January 2019 to December 2019. Sixty KOA participants were randomly allocated to either EA (n=30) or SA (n=30) groups. Participants in EA group were treated with semi-standardized on different meridian syndrome, including five obligatory acupoints and three adjunct acupoints. Eight non-acupoints that were separated from conventional acupoints or meridians were used for the SA group. Both groups received 24 sessions within eight weeks. The primary outcome was response rate, defined as a change of ≥50% from baseline in total scores of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included function, pain, stiffness, quality of life and acupuncture-related adverse events at four and eight weeks. Results: Of 60 participants randomized, 56 (93.3%) completed the study. Response rates were 60% for the EA group and 30% for the SA group after eight weeks. Significant differences were observed in WOMAC pain and total scores within two groups ( P =0.026, P =0.043). Rates of adverse events were low and similarly distributed between groups. Conclusion: EA intervention based on meridian differentiation in KOA was feasible and appeared safe, having a stronger impact on pain than SA. Future studies can be designed with larger sample size, adequately powered, randomization design and less biases. Trial registration number: NCT03274713.",

    "abstract": "It has been found that pain in various parts of the body can be temporarily eliminated by mechanically suppressing or stimulating the front tooth. Some typical examples of this are described in this article. We know which teeth represent which organs, but we also have diagrams that show the cause of the pain, such as changes in certain areas of the electrocardiogram, and those possible areas are shown somewhere in the electrocardiogram. One minute downward pressure on the tip of any one of the front 3 teeth (1st incisor, 2nd incisor, and canine) at the right and left sides of the upper and lower jaw by a wooden toothpick induced temporary disappearance (20 min-4 hours) of abnormally increased pain parameters (pain grading, Substance P, &amp; TXB 2 ), and cancer parameters (Telomere, Integrin α 5 β 1 , Oncogene C-fos Ab2, etc. of Astrocytoma, Glioblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, adenocarcinoma of lung, breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of colon, prostate cancer). The effect included temporary disappearance of headache, toothache, chest and abdominal pain, and backache, often with improved memory &amp; concentration. Since these beneficial changes resembled the effects of giving one optimal dose of DHEA, increase of DHEA was measured. Above mechanical stimulation of one of these front teeth increased abnormally reduced DHEA levels of less than 10 ng to normal 100–130 ng BDORT units and normal cell (NC) telomeres from markedly reduced values to near normal values, and improved acetylcholine in the Hippocampus. Large organ representation areas for the Adrenal gland &amp; Hippocampus may exist at these front teeth. This method can be used for emergency pain control and can explain the beneficial effect of bruxism and tooth brushing, through the increase of DHEA levels and activities of the Hippocampus by increasing Acetylcholine. Increasing NC telomere to optimally high level resulted in disappearance of pain and improvement or significant reduction of malignant tumor.",

Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to establish a database of prescriptions for head and neck diseases, chest and flank diseases, abdomen diseases, lumbosacral diseases and limbs diseases, and a network of acupoint compatibilities was constructed using the Cytoscape software. Using the network analysis method, the commonly used acupoint compatibilities and core acupoints of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment for various parts of diseases and syndromes in EPWATG were excavated.&lt;br/&gt; Results: The commonly used acupoint compatibilities in EPWATG prescriptions for the treatment of head and neck diseases are Tianzhu and Taodao, Hanyan and Houding, and Baihui and Xinshu, and the core acupoints are Tianzhu, Benshen, Kunlun, Zhongzhu, Zutonggu, Fengchi and Shangguan. The commonly used acupoint compatibilities for the treatment of chest and flank diseases are Ququan and Xiangu, Rangu and Taixi, and Yanggu and carpal bone, and the core acupoints are Zhangmen, Feishu, Tanzhong, Yunmen, Jimen and Zhongfu. The commonly used acupoint compatibilities for the treatment of abdominal diseases are Gongsun and Taibai, Shuigou and Dazhui, and Dazhui and Shixuan, and the core acupoints are Tanzhong, zhangmen, Pishu, Ganshu, Laogong and Taixi. The commonly used acupoint compatibilities for the treatment of lumbosacral diseases are Xialiao and Shangliao, Danshu and Geshu, and Dazhu and Shentao, and the core acupoints are Dachangshu, Weizhong, Weiyang, Chengfu and Eight-liao. The commonly used acupoint compatibilities for the treatment of four limbs diseases are Dubi and Shanglian, Dubi and Xialian, and Shanglian and Xialian, and the core acupoints are Xuanzhong, Zusanli, Fuliu, Sanyinjiao, Shanglian, Xialian and Shugu.&lt;br/&gt; Conclusion: The selection of acupuncture points in EPWATG follows the law of acupoint selection based on the meridians and diseased parts.

However, the effect and mechanism of this therapy in autoimmune uveitis is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the immunity-inhibitory effect of CIA in an experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) rat model. EAU was established in Lewis rats by the injection of IRBP1177–1191 peptide. The rats were randomly divided into control and CIA groups. Phenotypic and histological assessments were performed days 9, 13, 18, 23 post-immunization. The percentage of Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes were determined by flow cytometry. The expression of IL-17 and IFN-γ was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the CIA group, delayed mild inflammation was observed. Pathological investigation found alleviated infiltration of lymphocytes and ocular damage. Flow cytometry showed significantly decreased Th17 lymphocytes at day 9, 13, and 18 post-immunization (P&lt;0.05) and no significant changes at day 23 post-immunization (P=0.868) after CIA. The Th1 lymphocytes were significantly decreased at day 13 and 18 post-immunization (P&lt;0.05) and comparable at day 9 (P=0.111) and 23 (P=0.551) post-immunization in the CIA group. IL-17 and IFN-γ mRNA levels were notably decreased at day 9, 13 and 18 post-immunization (P&lt;0.05) and showed a downward trend at day 23 post-immunization, although with no significance (P=0.080 and P=0.137, respectively) after CIA.

Complementary medicine is considered when pain treatment is insufficient. There are studies available investigating the effect of acupuncture. In this study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of acupuncture with NSAIDs. Patients admitted to Ankara Atatürk Research Hospital in a one-year period and diagnosed with CPP were included. Patients with organic pathology were excluded. Acupuncture was applied to 38 patients and 30 patients received NSAIDs according to their choice. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Pain Disability Index (PDI) were applied. Pre-treatment PDI in the acupuncture group was 47.15±11.84 and it was 24.95±14.16 after treatment.

VAS in the NSAID group pre-treatment was 4.40±2.44 and it was 2.63±2.20 after treatment. Both of the groups had significant decreases in their scores. The pre-treatment scores in the acupuncture group were higher than the NSAID group. This finding may indicate that patients in the acupuncture group were NSAID resistant.

    "abstract": "Postoperative pain cannot be treated adequately in all patients, even though there are new developments in analgesic agents and treatment techniques. Thisstudy investigates the effect of pre-incisional and post-incisional electro- acupuncture on mechanical hyperalgesia in rat incisional pain model. This study was carried out with 40 healthy Sprague-Dawley male rats. The rats were divided into 5 groups: Group 1; first electro-acupuncture, then incision. Group 2; first incision, then electro-acupuncture. Group 3; first sham electro-acupuncture, then incision. Group 4; first incision, then sham electro-acupuncture. Group 5; control (incision only). Electro-acupuncture was applied to the ST36 and SP6 acupuncture points on the right hind paw. Sham electro- acupuncture was applied to the right thigh. Von Frey filaments were used to measure hyperalgesia at baseline and at 4th, 6th, 24th and 48th hours. Shapiro Wilk test was used to determine whether the distribution of continuous variables was close to normal. Levene's test was used for homogeneity of variances. Bonferroni Correction Wilcoxon Sign test was used to determine whether the differences between follow-up times were statistically significant or not. Bonferroni Correction on Kruskal Wallis test was used to determine whether there was any difference between groups. If the Kruskal Wallis test statistics were significant, analysis was performed using Conover's multiple comparison test. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study found that electro-acupuncture decreases hyperalgesia, and there was no significant difference between pre-incisional and post-incisional application in terms of the anti-hyperalgesic effectiveness of electro-acupuncture, except for the duration of action. Pre-incisional applications are more effective than post-incisional applications. Pre-incisional sham electro-acupuncture has also been found to have anti-hyperalgesic effect. Our findings support the studies that electro-acupuncture can be used for preemptive purposes in surgical patients. We think that researches should be continued in order to provide alternative methods for pain treatment.",

For 64 infectious atheromas, atheroma contents were excreted and the cyst wall was contacted with 76% ethanol gauze for 5 minutes. Postoperatively, the cyst was washed daily as an open drainage. All cases were cured 10 days postoperatively, and no side effects. Postoperative follow-up study results in 36 cases showed no recurrence in an average of 5 years. Pathological examination revealed koilocytosis in 14 of 25 cases (56.0%), which is considered to be an indirect finding of viral infection. The changes in human papillomavirus (HPV 16) before and after ethanol therapy in 25 cases using the Bi-Digital O- ring Test (BDORT) decreased significantly from 1026.0 ng (BDORT units) preoperatively to 1.6ng (BDORT units) postoperatively. In also 12 cases follow- up study without microscopy HPV 16 same decreased from 1064.2ng to 1.2ng (BDORT unit) using BDORT with atheroma photographs. In total, HPV 16 could be demonstrated in 37 of 64 cases (57.8%) using BDORT. Temporal changes of HPV 16 used for BDORT in 7 cases after contact with ethanol were inactivated after 3 minutes 30 seconds. The involvement of HPV 16 is suggested as the cause of atheroma. It is speculated that ethanol inactivated HPV 16 of atheroma, which stopped the turnover of the squamous epithelium and prevented recurrence. Ethanol therapy for infectious atheroma is useful as an original new one-stage surgery because it is a simple procedure and has no side effects or recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Background: Warming acupuncture (WA) is widely used in the management of Cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR) in China and obtains desirable efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this study is to systematically assess the efficacy and safety whether using WA alone or combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy for the treatment of CSR. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Sinomed, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang databases were searched from their inception through 30 September 2020. All the retrieved records were screened or excluded based on the criteria that were pre-established, and the results that meet the criteria were assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan5.3 software. Results: Fourteen RCTs (1021patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The effective rate of WA alone or combination with TCM therapy was analyzed in comparison with the treatment of regular therapy. The results indicated that compared with regular therapy, WA alone or in combination with TCM therapy increased clinical effective rate (Odds ratio (OR)=4.43, 95% CI 2.85 to 6.90, P&lt;0.01). Additionally decreased VAS score (mean difference (MD)=-1.21, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.73, P&lt;0.01), PPI (MD = -1.34, 95% CI -2.08 to -0.61) and PRI (MD = -0.55, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.37, P&lt;0.001). However, adverse events of WA were not specially reported in all studies. Conclusions: WA as the main treatment for CSR can improve the clinical effective rate and reduce the level of VAS score, PPI and PRI. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of WA for CSR treatment, rigorously and unambiguously.",

    "abstract": "Purpose : Acupuncture treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a long history and has been widely recognized in the medical community. However, its mechanism of action still is rarely uncovered. In the present study, the effects of acupuncture on the immune function and MAPK pathway in synovial tissue of rats with RA were investigated; it aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of acupuncture on alleviating RA.&lt;br/&gt; Methods: Rats were randomly divided into control, model and acupuncture groups, 15 rats each group, and RA rat model was induced via bovine type II collagen in complete Freund's adjuvant. The acupuncture group received \"Zusanli\" and \"Shenshu\" warm acupuncture treatment on the first day after modeling, acupuncture stimulation once a day for 21 days. The rat weight and degree of joint swelling were recorded and calculated. The ankle joint histopathology was observed by H&amp;E staining. Serum inflammatory cytokines were detected using ELISA. An automatic biochemical analyzer was used to test serum IgG, IgM and IgA levels. Transcription factors T-bet, GATA3, RORγT, Foxp3 mRNA were monitored through RT-qPCR technology. Further, the expression of key targets of MAPK signal or phosphorylation in synovial tissue were determined using Western blotting.&lt;br/&gt; Results: Acupuncture relieved the joint swelling and weight loss of RA rats, ameliorated the pathological damage of the ankle joint, significantly increased the serum IgG, IgM, IgA and T-bet, and Foxp3 levels, and reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, GATA3, and RORγT; down-regulated synovial tissue p-p38MAPK, p-JNK, and p-ERK1/2 levels and protein phosphorylation ratio ( P &lt;0.05).&lt;br/&gt; Conclusion: Acupuncture stimulation can improve the joint damage and promote the immune function of RA rats, possibly via blocking the expression of MAPK pathway in synovial tissue. This study provides a scientific and promising reference for acupuncture further in the clinical strategy of RA.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: In China, patients with chronic cholecystitis account for approximately 10% of the total population, in which over 90% of cholecystitis is caused by cholelithiasis. This study aimed to discuss the possible mechanism of electroacupuncture on the Yanglingquan acupoint promoting gallbladder contractibility of patients with chronic cholecystitis. Methods: 60 patients were randomly divided into a trial group and a control group. Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler blood flow imaging was applied. The trial group adopted the BT701-1B electroanesthesia apparatus to perform electroacupuncture on the bilateral acupoints of Yanglingquan, while electroacupuncture was made on sham acupoints in the control group. Results: Before the electroacupuncture, gallbladder volume was 49.6 ± 5.66 ml, after 15 min and 30 min of electroacupuncture, the gallbladder volume was then 32.9 ± 5.66 ml and 23.0 ± 2.83 ml respectively. The comparison before and after electroacupuncture was obviously and statistically different (P &lt; 0.01). The comparison between after 15 min and 30 min is obviously statistically different (P &lt; 0.01). Before the electroacupuncture, the gallbladder artery Vmax, Vmin, and RI were 18.4 ± 2.69 cm/s, 9.7 ± 0.07 cm/s, and 0.47 ± 0.06, respectively; the cystic artery Vmax, Vmin, and RI after 30 min were 8.1 ± 0.92 cm/s, 3.1 ± 0.57 cm/s, and 0.61 ± 0.02. The comparison in gallbladder artery Vmax and Vmin and the drag index (RI) before and after electroacupuncture was obviously and statistically different (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Electroacupuncture on the acupoints of Yanglingquan has the potential to promote the emptying of the gallbladder. The mechanism may be related to that the smooth muscle of the gallbladder contracts after electroacupuncture and the gallbladder empties.",

Furthermore, the effect of electro-acupuncture when stimulating BL32 acupoints in SD rats with slow transit constipation were observed to determine changes in intestinal transmission function. Methods: Thirty SD rats were selected and divided randomly into three groups. Rats in the model group were given 2 mg/kg/d of loperamide tablets by gavage for 15 days. The morphology of the feces of rats was observed, and the dry weight of the feces and the time of first black feces movement with black ink by gavage after molding were measured. After 20 days of electro-acupuncture treatment at the BL32 acupoint, the time of first black feces movement, the ratio of black ink length of the entire length of the intestine, and contraction amplitude and frequency of contraction were measured. Results: The time of black feces movement in the two model groups was significantly prolonged ( P &lt;0.05). Furthermore, fecal grains, dry weight and moisture content were significantly reduced ( P &lt;0.05). On the 10 th and 20 th day of treatment, the time of black feces movement in the treatment group significantly decreased ( P &lt;0.05). The ratio of black ink length of the entire length of the intestine in the electro-acupuncture group was significantly higher than that in the model group ( P &lt;0.05). Moreover, contraction amplitude was significantly higher than in the model control group ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: Through loperamide gavage, the model of slow transit constipation in SD rats was successfully established in a relatively short period of time. Electro-acupuncture treatment had a rapid onset of action, and its mechanism might have been caused through strengthening the ability of intestinal smooth muscle contraction, and are independent with increased smooth muscle contraction frequency.",

    "abstract": "Background Acupuncture therapy has been widely applied all around the world. But there still lacks high-quality evidence to evaluate its clinical effects, safety and cost-effectiveness, which seriously restricts its further promotion and development. Acupuncture, as an operational intervention, is more complex than drug therapy. Factors involved in the acupuncture operation process, such as individual and interventional factors, may affect the clinical effects. Purposes Through this systematic review, we attempt to analyze the current status of studies about the key factors influencing clinical effects, so as to provide evidence for the design of acupuncture studies. Methods A literature research was conducted in six databases until May, 2020. Studies were screened and assessed by two authors independently. Data extraction was made after screening. We extracted the basic information of these studies, including publishing years and countries, population and factors influencing clinical effects. Results Through the initial search in these six database, 6404 records were retrieved. After duplication and screening, a total of 355 studies were finally included in the qualitative analysis. About 88.5% of these studies were conducted in China with increasing number in the past decades, covering neurological disorders, orthopedic disorders, obstetrical and gynecological diseases, digestive diseases and so on; 239 studies focused on stimulus parameters which may influence effects, accounting for 67.3%, and 128, 44, 39, 32, 15, 11 studies discussed acupoints, patients' pathological states, individual difference, psychological states, deqi , and other factors separately. Conclusion There are more and more studies focusing on factors influencing acupuncture clinical effects, including stimulus parameters, acupoints, individual difference, patient pathological and psychological states. Based on this systematic review, several ignored factors should be considered for future researches, and more scientifically and objectively high quality evidence should also be proved.",

Objective: To investigate the effects of low-frequency (1-5 Hz) and highfrequency (50-100 Hz) electric acupuncture (EA) stimulation on bronchial dilation. Design: Prospective, single-center study Setting: Teikyo Heisei University Subjects: Seventeen healthy male adults Randomization: We randomly assigned subjects to 2-Hz EA and 100-Hz EA groups in a crossover trial. The washout period was 2 weeks. Intervention: Both groups underwent a respiratory function test, followed by a 5-minute rest, followed a 5-minute rest or EA stimulation, followed by a 5min rest. Heart rate variability was measured at rest, followed by another respiratory function test. Acupuncture was delivered near the cervical ganglia at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra on the left side. EA stimuli were set to 2-Hz or 100-Hz, and stimulation intensity was set to a level where no pain was felt. Main outcome measures: Spirometry (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and maximum respiratory flow), autonomic nerve activity (low-frequency component, high-frequency component, and their ratio), and heart rate variability. Results: Heart rate variability analysis showed significant differences in heart rate between the 2-Hz EA and 100-Hz EA groups. The 2-Hz EA group showed a significant increase in HF. Conclusions: 2-Hz EA stimulation resulted in decreased heart rate and increased HF during stimulation. This may be more effective for regulation of the autonomic nerves of the cardiopulmonary system than 100-Hz EA stimulation. Future studies are required to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a global epidemic and public health crisis in our country as well as all over the world.We aimed to investigate the changes in serum leptin and nesfatin-1 levels measured before and after acupuncture in overweight/obese patients. This randomized controlled study was carried out on 90 overweight/obese patients. Participants were divided into three groups: Group 1 (Acupuncture), Group 2 (Diet), and Group 3 (Control). Serum leptin and nesfatin-1 levels were measured before and after the intervention. The 30 days leptin values were significantly decreased in the acupuncture group (p=0.040) while they were significantly increased in the control group (p=0.039). It was detected that the nesfatin-1 values were significantly increased in both acupuncture (p=0.032) and diet groups (p=0.017). Also, body weights significantly decreased both in acupuncture (p=0.032) and diet groups (p&lt;0.001). In the present study, auricular acupuncture was found to be more effective than body acupuncture in reducing body weight. Our results support the effects of acupuncture treatment on appetite hormones. Further research on the mechanisms of endogenous and exogenous actions of the recently discovered hormones leptin and nesfatin-1 isneeded.",

    "abstract": "A patient with a whiplash injury suffering from prolonged symptoms, including pain and weakness of the right upper extremity and the symptoms of Barré-Liéou syndrome, was diagnosed and treated with the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test as a supplement to standard medical examinations. Radiological findings showed spondylotic canal stenosis with osteophytes and disc protrusions. The Bi-Digital O-Ring Test indicated a strong abnormal response around the right side of his neck and right shoulder, including the area of the vertebral artery and at acupuncture point GB 21, where positive resonant responses to Cytomegalovirus and Streptococcus faecalis were detected. Antibiotic and anti-viral agents, as well as Ku-Oketsu-Zai, a type of Oriental herbal medicine for overcoming blood stagnation or stasis, were administered according to the drug compatibility test using the Bi-Digital O-ring Test and the following clinical results were obtained. Infection at the site of the vertebral artery and the peri-arterial sympathetic nerve plexus was considered as a cause of the prolongation of the symptoms including Barré-Liéou syndrome, in this case. In addition we especially noted, in this clinical case, that the patient's impaired grasping force dramatically improved from 8 kg to 52 kg in a very short periods of time when the patient held suitable medicine selected with the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test drug compatibility test. We assume that the drug action was transferred electromagnetically, by which the pathological electromagnetic oscillations caused by trauma and following infections were scavenged. This effect might lead to an improvement in the coordination of the neuromuscular system.",

Through the diverse fields of science, e.g. educational psychology, physiology, electronics and acoustics, the principal law governing the l/f fluctuations (where f is frequency), or the inverse frequency distribution of the power spectrum, seems to play an important role in their phenomenological mechanism. The author totally explained in this paper such relations and he arranged the related phenomena into physical, physiological, psychological and pedagogical fields. Finally, he referred to an interesting example of the application of l/f fluctuations to the relief of pain by acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of reported results it is here postulated that acupuncture induces states of exceptionally low noise-level and that it shares essential features with the \"quiet\" of meditation. Noise, in the present context, can be represented by physiological interactions with factors that have no relevance to the nature of the essential physiological activities. These are \"disturbed\" by the noise. Decreasing relative noise-levels for a given signal are illustrated informationally by thermal noise in physics, chemistry, and physiological chemistry. Information, as noise decreases, becomes less diffuse and concurrently the perceived signals becomes sharper, more specific, and effectively more intense. Sharp differentiation becomes evident between formerly blurred signals. Weak signals ordinarily lost in the background become recognizable. Equivalent refinements in perception are cited by Zen Buddhist practitioners during and because of meditation. We are thus led to ascribe similar refinement during acupuncture to physiological activities, in particular, to those of the cerebral cortex. Thus, the processing and flow of physiological information have become more specific, sensitive, and comprehensive for regulation and for restoration to normal function.",

In all groups, tumorous mice were used as controls. Regression of tumors was observed at wavelengths of 3374A and 3371A (total dosage 471 j/cm2 and 660 j/cm2). No regression was observed at 3507A. The regression in some cases was very impressive.

These activities include: Control of an instrument by the PC; Data acquisition from an experiment or subject; Analysis of the data that the computer has collected; Presentation of the analyzed data in a form that makes it useful; Long term storage of data. Until recently, these tasks required the user to be familiar with a high level programming language (HLL) in order to fulfill these assignments. Arcane text based programs whose logic is often difficult to follow is gradually being replaced by visual programming using a terminology based on icons where ideas familiar to scientists and medical practitioners rely on graphic symbols rather than textual language to describe programming actions.",

Here, the temporal response of skin sensation to electrical stimulation of skin is a very important factor. In this study, the temporal characteristics of skin sensation when transmitting sequential signals were examined and two modulation methods of electrical stimulation of skin were evaluated. One uses a coaxial electrode with temporal modulation and the other uses a coaxial electrode array with spatio-temporal modulation. It has been found that temporally sequential signals are recognized with higher accuracy with spatio-temporal modulation than with temporal modulation. Information transmission performance was also quantitatively analyzed using the Information Theory.",

    "abstract": "During a 3 year period from 1978 to 1980, one hundred and seventeen patients who came to the Pain Clinic of the Department of Anesthesiology of the Osaka Medical College complaining of pain, were treated with leaving needle(LN), direct current electrical acupuncture (EAP), or low-frequency electrical acupuncture(LFEA). The immediate effects of these therapies were investigated in a period of 3 days after treatment, on the basis of the patient's subjective evaluation of his relief from pain on a scale of 10 before treatment. Appearance patterns of therapeutic effects of these therapies were divided into four types: persistent (therapeutic effects persist during the 3 day period immediately after treatment), downward (therapeutic effects gradually decrease immediately after treatment), upward (therapeutic effects gradually appear after treatment), and unaltered (therapeutic effects were fair or poor during the 3 days after treatment). In addition, it was seen that of the three therapies LFEA was the best one in producing a persistent therapeutic effect and a good rate of effectiveness in the first day immediately after treatment.",

    "abstract": "As an interesting exception to the general clinical application of the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT), the test could not be performed successfully in diagnosing a patient who suffered from cancer of the pineal body. The following examinations were attempted using the BDORT: 1) The thymus representation area, 2) the distal forearm during compression of the upper arm, 3) surface representations of diseased areas that had previously been identified by the indirect method with slide preparations of pineal body or lung cancer tissue, 4) holding of oncogene c-fos Ab2 and integrin alpha 5 beta 1. Results suggest that the failure of the BDORT might be due to the absence of pineal body function. It is suggested that the sensor for the BDORT might exist in the pineal body since 1) BDORT cannot be successfully performed when the eyes are closed, and the pineal body is sensitive to light; 2) electromagnetic resonance might stimulate this sensor; and 3) N-acetyltransferase, the enzyme that converts serotonin to methylserotonin in the pineal body, might be inhibited by activation of this sensor. As a result, serotonin levels might be increased by activation of this sensor, which might then inhibit finger flexor muscle contraction needed to maintain an O-ring in BDORT.",

A later report, the Belmont Report (1975) emphasized the difference between therapeutic research and research unrelated to improving the patient's state of health. Acupuncture has the status of an experimental modality, and requires the informed consent discussion and signature on the form by the patient for each procedure.",

    "abstract": "This method can be applied to the non-drug treatment of diseases. It provides an exact evaluation of the healing effect by keeping the acupuncture point from overload. This method is realized by a bistable/monostable square wave oscillator. The electrical pulses for the treatment of the acupuncture point are delivered from the noninverted oscillator output. Their electrical parameters: frequency, pulse duration, rise time and coefficient of filling depend on the constantly changeable biophysical parameters of the acupuncture point, such as complex skin impedance (z), and total infrared skin thermal emission (te). Pulses from the inverted oscillator output are provided to the acoustic and visual channels. In the acoustic channel, the pulses are controlled only by amplitude. The visual output channel pulses apply to the amplitude- frequency circuit, where an amplitude-frequency analysis is performed. The output pulses of three electrical filters (low, middle and high frequency), control three sources of light, respectively red, green, and blue. Three colors blend on the white screen, as the color picture is modulated by the two biophysical parameters of the acupuncture point. These parameters are in a constant dynamics. The audio channel output information is delivered to the audio-information gate of the patient, reaching the Central Nervous System (CNS). The video channel output information is applied to the video-information gate and then to the patient's CNS, preparing it for appropriate therapeutical programs.",

    "abstract": "In 1985, Omura, Y. discovered that, when specific molecules were placed anywhere in the close vicinity of the path of a light beam (laser), their molecular information, as well as information on electrical & magnetic fields, is transmitted bi-directionally along the path of this light beam. Namely, this information is transmitted in the direction the light beam is projected and towards the direction from which the light beam is coming. This finding was applied to the following clinical and basic research: 1) In the past, using indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, human or animal patients were diagnosed through an intermediate third person holding a good electrical conducting probe, the tip of which was touching the part of the patient to be examined. However, in order to diagnose the patient in isolation from a distance, or a dangerous or unmanagable unanesthesized animal, such as a lion or tiger, the author succeeded in making a diagnosis by replacing the metal conducting probe with a soft laser beam which is held by the one hand of the third person whose index finger is placed in close vicinity of the laser beam generated by a battery-powered penlight-type solid state laser generator. Thus, diagnosis within visible distance, without direct patient contact, became a reality. 2) Using a projection light microscope, by giving indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test while contacting with a fine electro-conductive probe on the magnified fine structure of normal and abnormal cells, various normal and abnormal intracellular substances were localized through a third person holding a pure reference control substance with the same hand that is holding the probe as an intermediary for the indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. Instead of the photon beam in a light microscope, the author found that, using an electron beam passing through the close vicinity of specific molecules of specimens in an electron microscope, the molecular information is transmitted to the magnified fluorescent screen, and an indirect Bi-Digital O-Ring Test could be performed through a projected penlight-type solid state soft laser beam on the magnified intracellular structure through an observation glass window. Using the magnified fine structure of the cells, by either a light projection microscopic field or electron microscope, in various cancer cells of both humans and animals, Oncogen C-fos (AB2) and mercury were found inside of the nucleus. Integrin alpha 5 beta 1 was found on cell membranes and nuclear cell membranes of cancer cells. Acetylcholine was not found anywhere within cancer cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
