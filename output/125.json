The Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) appears as one of the most successful approach of therapy. METHODS: To assess long-term efficacy and safety, we reviewed 28 patients (Child B/C: 43/57%) who underwent TIPS placement for refractory hepatic hydrothorax in our institution between 1992 and 2001. RESULTS: The 30-days mortality was 14%, reaching 25% at 90 days. The one-year survival without liver transplantation was 41.2%. Reduction in the volume of pleural effusion and improvement in clinical symptoms was observed in 68% while a complete radiological and echographic disappearance of hydrothorax was documented in 57%. Statistical analysis showed that poor liver function was predictive of mortality and non-response. Of the different liver function parameters and in this small series, the Child-Pugh score was more discriminating than the recently described Mayo risk score. CONCLUSION: This study shows that TIPS is effective in the treatment of hepatic hydrothorax for selected patients. Poor liver function is a strong predictive of bad outcome.",

Many animal models of alcohol exposure have highlighted the key role of the alcohol-induced gut microbiota alterations, leaky gut and translocation of microbial products in the development of liver disease (ALD). However, in humans, there is no clear picture defining an alcoholic microbiome, and the link between intestinal dysbiosis and ALD development is far from being understood. Although we do not comprehend all the mechanistic insights, clinical studies aiming at modulating the gut microbiota of patients have shown some beneficial effects. Here we review the potential therapeutic effects of probiotics in ALD and give some clinical perspectives on the role of prebiotics and the use of fecal microbiota transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is widely accepted as a minimally invasive treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC) in Japan. However, the criteria for EMR must be strictly adhered to otherwise patients will miss the chance for additional therapy. We assess the important factor in expanding the indication of EMR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  We investigated 1101 EGCs that had been resected by EMR at the National Cancer Center Hospital (NCCH), Tokyo, Japan, according to the indication recommended by Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA) and the expanded indication proposed by NCCH. Curability and local recurrence of the EMRs were assessed related to the applied indication and the number of resected specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  The recurrence rate of non-evaluable resection was higher than that of evaluable resection (P < 0.0001). Eighty-three lesions among 772 lesions in the JGCA group were non-evaluable. Thirty-seven leisons among 329 lesions in the NCCH group were non-evaluable. There was no difference in the rate of non-evaluable resection between JGCA and NCCH groups (P = 0.8329). However, the rate of curative resection was lower in the NCCH group than in the JGCA group (P = 0.0009). In piecemeal resection, there was no difference in the rate of non-evaluable resection between JGCA and NCCH groups (P = 0.0527). In one-piece resection, the rate of non-evaluable resection was lower in the NCCH group than the JGCA group (P = 0.0137).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  Based on our series of cases, we propose one-piece resection as a gold standard for EMR because it enables accurate histological evaluation, even in the EMR, according to the expanded indication.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Due to the remarkable progress of endoscopic resection techniques, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been widely performed for larger mucosal tumors that would result in large artiﬁcial ulcers. The healing process of peptic ulcers has been previously studied in detail; however, no precise investigation for artiﬁcial ulcers after ESD has been reported. To conﬁrm the validity of the treatment from the aspect of wound healing, we aimed to clarify the healing process of large gastric artiﬁcial ulcers after ESD.\r\n\r\nMethods:  Seventy patients with gastric mucosal tumors treated by ESD were enrolled. The size, location and time of scar formation of the ulcers were reviewed using endoscopic pictures taken from the same view and angle. Follow-up endoscopy was performed at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after ESD. For postoperative medication, all patients received normal doses of proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate for 8 weeks.\r\n\r\nResults:  The average size of the resected specimen was 34.7 mm (20–90 mm). Irrespective of ulcer size and location, all of the cases healed up to scarring stages within 8 weeks.\r\n\r\nConclusions:  Gastric artiﬁcial ulcers after ESD healed within 8 weeks regardless of size and location using normal doses of medication as peptic ulcers. The fact that even giant ulcers after ESD heal within 8 weeks could be helpful information for candidates for ESD and for postoperative management of patients after ESD.",

    "abstract": "Observations of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using magnifying endoscopy have now been carried out extensively and, as a result, it has become clear that the morphology of the microvessels evident at the tumor surface reflects the depth of tumor invasion. In M1 and M2 cancer, the surface microvasculature reveals dilation and elongation of the intrapapillary capillary loops (IPCL). However, at this stage, some immature capillaries resembling IPCL also arise inside the tumor and, therefore, the view of the microvasculature should be described as one showing 'intermixing of modified IPCL and IPCL-like immature capillaries (IPCL-like abnormal capillary)'. As cancer invades into the muscularis mucosa (M3 or deeper), an obviously dilated and irregularly branched tumor-specific vasculature, more accurately described as 'neovasculature', can be observed. From our magnifying endoscopy observations and studies of the molecular profile of early esophageal cancer, we conclude that two major angiogenic steps exist in precancerous and M3 lesions in the early phase of cancer progression. In addition, it is now possible to study cell morphology using an endocytoscope with a much higher magnification (×400-×1000) than magnifying endoscopes currently on the market. The histology revealed in this way may reduce the need for conventional biopsy histology in the future.",

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in order to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19-induced liver injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting laboratory data about COVID-19 patients, with last update on 25th March 2020. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of COVID- 19-induced liver damage, mainly represented by increase in serum transaminases and bilirubin. The secondary outcome was the description of abnormalities in serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). We focused on laboratory data only on hospital admission, and adopted random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Out of 793 included patients, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related liver damage was 22.17% (95% CI 17.64 to 27.07), mostly indicated by hypertransaminasemia. Serum bilirubin was increased in 5.53% (95% CI 3.60 to 7.85) of cases. Abnormal serum albumin was observed in 78.92% (95% CI 39.82 to 99.56), and increased PT value in 19.98% (95% CI 2.49 to 78.23), but these results derived from significantly heterogeneous studies. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-induced liver injury must not be ignored, as it is observed in one fifth of infected patients. Prospective studies evaluating liver function during the course of COVID-19 are needed to provide a complete overview of hepatic involvement during this viral infection.",

As the body of work concerning transdifferentiation of somatic stem cells and bone marrow derived stem cells grows, the number of critics increases steadily questioning the reliability of reported findings. So scientists are now challenged more and more to prove that resulting differentiated somatic cells originated from somatic adult stem cell through a transdifferentiation process. Phenomenons such as fusion of cells have to be ruled out and the origin of the differentiated cell has to be determined by specific techniques i.e. in situ hybridisation. Cellular mimicry through uptake of specific factors out of the medium is questioned to be the reason for cells staining positive for Insulin. Some multipotent adult stem cells can cross lineage boundaries and differentiate into somatic cells of other lineages after being relocated. Bone marrow cells have been described to have the greatest plasticity among adult stem cells regenerating damaged liver or myocardium. It has been proposed that the differentiation of bone marrow derived adult stem cells occurs naturally even in healthy organs as a physiologic process of tissue-regeneration. Others believe that organ damage is essential to induce transdifferentiation by release of organ specific microenvironmental factors. We here try to constitute necessary data which should be demonstrated to give substantial evidence for transdifferentiation of newly characterized cells including exclusion of fusion, phagocytosis or DNA uptake, description of the outset cell, differentiation into all three germ layers and functional parameters.",

The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was found uncertain or erroneous in 7 out of the 40 patients and the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 10 out of the 61 patients. The difficulties of differential diagnosis were related to three factors: clinical presentation of some cancers resembling that of chronic pancreatitis, presence of pancreatitic calcifications in some cancers and misinterpretation of pancreatic cavities as cysts or as tumour necroses.",

    "abstract": "Results: The study included 199,008 patients with nonvariceal UGIH and 3251 patients with variceal UGIH. Compared with patients admitted on weekdays, patients with nonvariceal UGIH admitted on weekends had similar adjusted in-hospital mortality rates (odds ratio [OR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93–1.30), endoscopic therapy rates (OR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.04), and length of stay (P Z .09), but had lower early endoscopy rates (within 24 hours)(OR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.60–0.67), lower in-hospital endoscopy rates (OR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91), and higher hospitalization charges (mean increase, $1558; P Z .01). Patients with variceal UGIH admitted on weekends and weekdays did not differ in any of these outcomes. Limitations: Retrospective data, administrative database. Conclusions: Compared with patients admitted on weekdays, patients with nonvariceal UGIH admitted on weekends had similar mortality rates and lengths of stay, but lower endoscopy rates and higher hospitalization charges. Patients with variceal GI hemorrhage had similar outcomes regardless of day of admission. (Gastrointest Endosc 2014;80:228-35.)",

    "abstract": "Background:  Accurate evaluation of the depth of tumor invasion, including the degree of submucosal invasion, is a prerequisite to selecting the treatment procedure for early colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the significance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for diagnosing the depth of invasion of early CRC and selecting the treatment procedure. We concurrently estimated the usefulness of three-dimensional EUS (3-D-EUS) compared with that of conventional EUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  We studied 413 consecutive early CRC for which the depth of invasion was examined by EUS. They consisted of 239 lesions of mucosal cancers and 174 lesions of submucosal cancers (sm cancers). We divided sm cancers into two groups, sm-slight cancers (38 lesions) and sm-massive cancers (136 lesions), according to the degree of infiltration in the vertical direction in the submucosa. The diagnostic accuracy of the depth of cancerous invasion by EUS and the characteristics of tumors that were difficult to image by EUS were examined. For 59 lesions, the depth of invasion was concurrently evaluated by 3-D-EUS to compare the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic tool with that of conventional EUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  In 364 lesions (88%) of early CRC, we could diagnose the depth of invasion by EUS. Differentiation between mucosal or sm-slight cancers, which were generally treated by endoscopic resection or local excision, and sm-massive cancers, which were suitable for radical operation, was possible in 90%. A total of 49 lesions (12%) could not be imaged by EUS. Difficulty in imaging often occurred with lesions located proximally to the transverse colon and with protruded-type lesions. The accuracy rate of 3-D-EUS for differentiating between mucosal or sm-slight cancers and sm-massive cancers, including difficult-to-image lesions, was 86%. This figure was slightly, but not significantly higher, than the accuracy rate of 73% for conventional EUS (P = 0.07). However, the concurrent application of 3-D-EUS was considered useful in 31 of the 59 lesions (53%) evaluated by both techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion: EUS is useful for evaluating the depth of tumor invasion and selecting the treatment procedure for early CRC. The concurrent use of 3-D-EUS may further improve diagnostic accuracy and decrease the number of difficult-to-image lesions.",

Another SD-type cancer grew rapidly to an advanced cancer; and (v) a superficial elevated adenoma developed into a IIa + IIc-type submucosally invasive cancer while maintaining the size of the initial tumor. From the analysis of the literature, 35 lesions were collected, but it was impossible to speculate which specific type of tumor grew rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions:  From the endoscopic observations of the present study and the review of the literature, developments of superficial type cancers were diverse, sessile-type cancers with marked configurational change, and early cancers developed slowly, although the speed of their growth accelerated according to the downward invasion of the cancer.",

We developed a new pancreatic duct stent, which was a 5 Fr, 4 cm-long stent with a single duodenal pigtail (Pit-stent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and Methods:  Pancreatic duct stenting using a Pit-stent was attempted in 76 patients (40 men, 36 women; mean age, 65 years; age range, 42–91 years) at high risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis and spontaneous passage of the stent were investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Pancreatic duct stent placement was successfully performed in 93% of the patients. One patient developed mild pancreatitis after ERCP (1.4%). Spontaneous passage of the stent was observed in 92%. There were no other complications or procedure-related deaths in this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions:  Pancreatic duct stent insertion may reduce the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients at high risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Spontaneous migration of a pancreatic stent that contributes to a lessening of the need for additional ERCP can be expected with the use of a Pit-stent.",

Cumulative risk of cancer in the rectal remnant 30 years after surgery was 57%. Five patients had metastases and three patients died of cancer in the rectal remnant after proctectomy. There was a trend towards a higher incidence of cancer in the rectal remnant in patients with small-intestinal adenoma and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. Multivariate analysis revealed that the ocular lesion was an independent risk factor associated with cancer in the rectal remnant.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nSubtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis does not seem to be an appropriate prophylactic surgery in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Since endoscopic resection (ER) has been established as a treatment for early gastric cancer, metachronous multiple cancers have become a problem. It is unclear whether the risk of metachronous cancer is self-limiting or permanent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of multiple cancers after ER during a long-term follow-up study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and Methods:  A total of 234 patients who received initial ER for early gastric cancers were evaluated retrospectively. ER included endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection. Patients were followed up with endoscopy for 3.0–19.6 years (median, 5.0 years), including 40 patients surveyed for more than 10 years. Accessory cancers detected after ER, but which could be retrospectively viewed in pre-ER pictures, were evaluated in the metachronous group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Thirty patients (12.8%) developed 36 metachronous multiple cancers. The median interval between the discovery of metachronous cancer and the initial ER was 3.2 years; the longest interval was 9.7 years. Eight (22.2%) of the 36 metachronous cancers could be detected retrospectively in the picture record from pre-ER. The Kaplan–Meier curve of cumulative incidence of metachronous cancers stopped increasing after 10 years of follow up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions:  Although the residual gastric mucosa after ER is thought to be a high-risk environment, the high risk may only be the result of occult synchronous cancers. It is probable that the high risk of metachronous cancers is not continuous after 10 years.",

Two months after resolution, a relapse of clinical and biochemical features of hepatitis occurring 10 days after the spontaneous resumption of therapy led to the diagnosis of drug-induced liver damage. This case represents the third reported case of severe hepatitis related to benzarone. The mechanism of liver toxicity was likely due to hypersensitivity.",

Currently, there are major limitations when assessing renal function in cirrhotic patients. Available methods are biased and have a tendency to overestimate glomerular filtration rates (GFR) consistently. A subset of new creatinine-based formulas derived specifically from these populations may provide a more accurate estimation of renal function. In this article, we will explore the estimation methods of GFR in cirrhosis available to date and discuss possible implications in clinical practice.",

Owing to the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome despite broad spectrum antibiotherapy, the patient was transfered to the intensive care unit. A diagnosis of pneumonitis due to methotrexate was made. Patient's condition improved after discontinuation of the drug, mechanical ventilation, and corticosteroids. The increasing use of methotrexate in several gastroenterological diseases warrants further consideration of the potential devasting side effects of this drug, particularly on the lungs. A review of the literature on this topic is provided in the ''discussion'' section.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Decompensated alcoholic liver disease (ALD) causes high morbidity and mortality. Factors associated with a poor clinical evolution, as well as the impact of liver atrophy linked with cirrhosis are poorly determined. The goal of this study is to explore the link between the liver volumetry calculated by computed tomography (CT) and the evolution of liver insufficiency in patients admitted for decompensated ALD. Materials and methods: Non-abstinent patients with acute decompensation of ALD (increase in serum bilirubin and deterioration of liver function) from a prospective study were included. This trial did not evidence any benefice of cellular therapy during the 3 months of follow up (Spahr L et al. Autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation versus standard of care in patients with decompensated alcoholic liver disease: interim analysis of a RCT. Hepatology 2011;54:A62). Liver volumes evaluated by CT performed rapidly after patient admission were compared to further evolution of hepatic insufficiency, irrespective of treatment allocation. We defined patients with a ≥ 3 points decrease in MELD compared to baseline value as “improvers”, and those with less than 3 points decrease in MELD as “non-improvers”. Results: Fifty-eight patients were included. At admission, mean MELD score was 20.6 points. All patients had cirrhosis. Biopsy proven alcoholic steatohepatitis was diagnosed in 81% of cases. Patients with severe steatohepatitis (Maddrey score ≥ 32) were treated by steroids (66 %). 34 patients (59%) with a good evolution at 3 months (decrease in MELD score of 3 points or more) were classified as improvers meanwhile 24 patients (41%) were classified as non-improvers. Patients’ characteristics at admission depending on the 3 month evolution are reported in this table. Parameter Improvers n=34 Non-improvers n=24 P Age (years) 54 [35-63] 55 [44-67] 0.11 Hepatovenous pressure gradient (mmHg) 19.2 ± 2.7 19.2 ± 4.1 0.25 MELD score 20.7 ± 5.9 20.6 ± 3.3 0.96 Albumin (g/l) 22.2 ± 4.4 22.4 ± 6.7 0.41 Steroid treatment (%) 67.6 62.5 0.68 Cellular therapy (%) 52.9 41.7 0.39 Liver volume (cm3) 2389 ± 998 1646 ± 489 0.0005 Ratio liver volume-body weight (%) 3.2 ± 1.5 2.2 ± 1.0 0.002 Conclusion: This study highlights the link between the severity of hepatic atrophy associated with cirrhosis and the prognosis in case of liver decompensation. Indeed, in patients with decompensated ALD, a low liver volume evaluated by CT is associated with a bad evolution of hepatic function evaluated by MELD score.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) was developed to attain endosonographical images in real time in endoscopic biopsy, just like in percutaneous biopsy with ultrasonic or computer-tomographical images. The results of EUS-FNAB in esophageal and mediastinal diseases were evaluated and clinical indications of this technique were investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  The study was performed in 58 patients, consisting of 30 with esophageal or mediastinal tumors and 28 requiring mediastinal lymph node examination. The instruments were linear array EUS transducer PEF-703FA (Toshiba-Fujinon, Tokyo, Japan) and 21G Endosonopsy (Hakko Shoji, Tokyo, Japan). The aspirated material was recovered on a filter paper and was formalin-fixed to be examined histopathologically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  The tumors measured 6–60 mm (mean 29 mm). Collection of tissue was successful in 95% of the patients, and diagnostic accuracy was 95%. The biopsy specimen was satisfactory to establish histological diagnosis in every case of 27 patients with malignant diseases. No complication was experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  The EUS-FNAB is indicated in cases where the technique of EUS-guided puncture is required, or is considered optimum in view of the safety and in cases where histological diagnosis is critical for the decision of treatment program. In many cases of mediastinal diseases, not even a detection of lesion is feasible without this technique, let alone a collection of tissue. The EUS-FNAB is thus performed as a first choice of examination to obtain biopsy specimen in such cases. Endoscsopic ultrasound-guided lymph node puncture is applied in order to assess the appropriateness of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in patients with esophageal cancer, to follow up the patients after EMR and chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant CRT.",

    "abstract": "With a prehepatic portal hypertensive rat model, we explored the involvement of humoral factors to the occurrence of portal hypertensive colopathy (PHC), another clinical entity besides portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) in portal hypertension, by investigating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial constitutive NOS (ecNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the colonic and gastric mucosa.Portal hypertension was produced by a two-stage ligation of portal vein plus ligation of the left adrenal vein in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Two weeks after complete obstruction of the portal vein, the portal pressure was measured and the expression of iNOS, ecNOS, ET-1, TNF-alpha and VEGF in the colonic and gastric mucosa were detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry methods.A 1.8 fold (P < 0.01) elevation of the portal pressure was detected in the portal hypertensive rats as compared to control. Significantly up-regulation of the mRNA levels of iNOS (P < 0.01), ET-1 (P < 0.05) and TNF-alpha (P < 0.01), but not ecNOS and VEGF, were detected in the colonic mucosa of portal hypertensive rats compared with control. The mRNA of iNOS, ecNOS, ET-1, TNF-alpha and VEGF were all significantly increased at varied levels in the gastric mucosa as compared to control (P all < 0.05). No difference of the appearance and localization of immunostaining of iNOS, ecNOS, ET-1, TNF-alpha and VEGF in the colonic and gastric mucosa were seen between two groups.These data suggest the involvement of the upregulation of iNOS, ET-1 and TNF-alpha in the colonic mucosal lesion of portal hypertensive rats.",

In cases in which a pancreatogram is not achieved or those in which only a small portion of the ductal anatomy is visualized via the major duodenal papilla, cannulation of the minor papilla provides a second route of access to the ductal system. Successful minor papilla cannulation requires meticulous attention to technique. As the orifice of the minor papilla is usually of pinpoint size, needle-tipped catheters are useful. As minor papilla cannulation in pancreas divisum carries the risk of severe pancreatitis, the procedure should be performed with more caution. In some patients with pancreas divisum, an increased resistance to flow across the small orifice results in dorsal pancreatic duct hypertension and clinical symptoms including acute recurrent pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic-type pain. Pancreas divisum patients with acute recurrent pancreatitis are the best candidates for endoscopic management for dorsal-duct decompression including endoscopic minor papilla sphincterotomy and stenting.",

The aim of the present study was to clarify features of acute esophagitis cases showing acute onset and severe endoscopic findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  We defined severe esophagitis that endoscopically showed circumferential diffuse mucosal lesion involving at least the entire lower third of the esophagus as acute esophageal mucosal lesion and investigated the clinical and endoscopic characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  We experienced six cases of black or dark esophagitis and six cases of non-black esophagitis. Both groups showed common clinical features. Patients were predominantly males older than middle age. The presenting symptoms were upper gastrointestinal bleeding such as coffee-ground-like vomit, hematemesis or tarry stool. Seven cases had a history of taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Endoscopically, both types of case showed diffuse circumferential erosion in the lower esophagus, which continuously extended, and worsened towards the esophagogastric junction. All had esophageal sliding hernia and five cases had duodenal mucosal lesion. All cases rapidly improved with a proton pump inhibitor except one case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  Black and non-black esophagitis was considered to belong to the same disease entity, acute esophageal mucosal lesion, which should be recognized as a differential diagnosis on emergency endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Respiratory suppression is observed during endoscopy under sedation. If respiratory suppression can be predicted before endoscopy, incidental complications can conceivably be prevented. In the present study, we focused on the relation between respiratory suppression from sedation and lung function.\r\n\r\nMethods:  A total of 211 patients underwent respiratory function tests before the surgical operation and gave written informed consent individually to participate in this study. We investigated the relation between respiratory suppression from sedation and lung function. During the endoscopic procedure, when blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) fell to below 90%, the patient was evaluated as ‘respiratory suppression present’.\r\n\r\nResults:  Sedation lowered SpO2 by an average of 6.0%, and was significantly lower than the prior to sedation blood oxygen saturation (PreSpO2). Compared to patients with SpO2 maintained up to 90%, patients with SpO2 fallen below 90% were significantly older, shorter in stature, lighter in bodyweight, and more commonly female. Furthermore, respiratory suppression from sedation was influenced by vital capacity (VC) and PreSpO2. Multivariate analysis was performed, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed for the respiratory suppression prediction model based on age, height, VC and PreSpO2 yielded area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79. As VCpredict can be calculated from age and height, the three variables of age, height and VC in the above model were substituted with VCpredict resulting in a two-factor model based on VCpredict and PreSpO2. The ROC curve of the two-factor model had AUC of 0.77, which was slightly decreased but by no means inferior.\r\n\r\nConclusion:  Predicting respiratory suppression from VCpredict and PreSpO2 is clinically relevant with the additional benefit of simplicity.",

    "abstract": "We studied digestive manifestations occurring during follow-up of 19 cases of myotonic dystrophy. GI symptoms occurred in 10 patients (53%), mainly dysphagia (n = 7). In patients undergoing investigations (n = 7), their digestive troubles were probably or definitively related to the neurological disease in 6 cases. Upper GI endoscopy was normal in 5 dysphagic patients. The oesophageal manometry was abnormal in 3 of 4 patients. Complications developed in 3 cases (16%). One patient presented two episodes of spontaneous pneumoperitoneum. A second one developed a chronic colonic pseudo-obstruction with megacolon treated by subtotal colectomy. Manometric studies revealed oesophageal aperistalsis, low amplitude of gastro-jejunal contractions but persistence of migrating motor complexes and a normal recto-anal reflex. A third patient developed an acute pseudo-obstruction with ischemic colitis. In conclusion, myotonic dystrophy frequently disturbs digestive tract motility and may cause complications such as intestinal pseudo-obstruction.",

This tumour, thought rare, still generates clinical interest, because of its characteristic association with occupationnal exposure to certain chemicals such as vinyl chloride and thorotrast.

The significant aspects of this tumour are delineated and the diagnostic modalities are discussed.",

Acute or chronic ductular and ductal cholestasis are induced by a few drugs. The acute form may mimic viral hepatitis or biliary tract obstruction. The outcome is generally good. The mechanism may be immunoallergic. The clinical presentation of the chronic form resembles that of primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis. Its prognosis is generally good and characterized by a complete recovery. However, an evolution to biliary cirrhosis is sometimes possible. The mechanism could also be immunoallergic. Extrahepatic cholestasis is frequently observed after intra-arterial infusion of floxuridine. The prognosis is generally poor. The mechanism of this sclerosing cholangitis may be ischaemic.",

Digestive or metabolic inputs are conveyed to the hypothalamus by endocrine and neuroendocrine pathways (insulin, cholecystokinin). The hypothalamus regulates feeding behavior both quantitatively and qualitatively through several neuroendocrine mediators (neuropeptide Y, galanin, GHRH...). The hypothalamus also integrates, by its communicative network, inputs from the cortex, the sub-cortex, the peripheral metabolism and it modifies consequently the feeding behavior. These neuroendocrine models are developed from many experimental observations both in normal and obese animals.",

Etiological diagnosis is possible after clinical and radiological evaluation. Colonoscopy is always indicated, except in toxic megacolon. Balloon dilatation of strictures, palliative treatment of colonic carcinoma by Laser procedures, reduction of colonic volvulus and aspiration of colonic pseudoobstruction are the principal indications of therapeutic colonoscopy in the non surgical treatment of dilated colon.",

Because of negative serological work-up, a tentative diagnosis of sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis was considered. Two months after resolution, a relapse of clinical and biochemical features of hepatitis occurring 10 days after the spontaneous resumption of therapy led to the diagnosis of drug-induced liver damage. This case represents the third reported case of severe hepatitis related to benzarone. The mechanism of liver toxicity was likely due to hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: Severe hepatitis C (HCV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT), HCV in cirrhotic patients listed for LT, and HCV in patients with severe extra-hepatic manifestations have a negative impact on patient survival and current treatment options are clearly suboptimal. Sofosbuvir (SOF), Daclatasvir (DCV) and Simeprevir (SMV) have been recently approved in Europe but there are limited data on the use of these drugs in the treatment of very difficult-to-treat patients with severe HCV. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with either severe HCV recurrence after LT, listed for LT or having severe extra-hepatic manifestations receiving SOF with SMV, DCV, Peginterferon (PegIFN) + ribavirin (RBV) or RBV in compassionate use or medical need in Belgium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatments. Results: 42 patients were enrolled in this data collection: 14 cirrhotics listed for LT, 17 LT recipients with severe recurrence, 8 with severe extra-hepatic manifestations, 2 decompensated cirrhotic patients, 1 cirrhotic IFN ineligible patient. 25 patients had clinical liver decompensation. SOF was administered in combination with SMV, DCV and RBV alone in 9, 17 and 5 cases, respectively. Four patients received SOF, DCV and RBV. SOF was administrated with PegIFN and RBV in 3 cases. The majority of the patients were male (72.5%). Median age was 55 [51.2-66.7] years. Genotype distribution was: genotype 1 (n=34), 2 (n=1), 3 (n=6) or 5 (n=1). In listed for LT and post-LT patients, median MELD and Child-Pugh scores were 13.7 [10.1-19.5] and 8 [5.5-10]. 6 patients have completed the treatment course and 31 are still on therapy. W4 and W12 HCV RNA undetectable was 20% (4/20) and 71,4% (10/14) respectively. End of treatment response was 100% (5/5) (1 viral load is ongoing) and SVR12 was 100% (2/2). Final SVR results will be presented. Treatment was stopped in 5 patients. 4 patients were transplanted, viral load after LT was positive in 1 patient and currently unknown for the 3 others. SAEs were reported in 3 patients, 2 (hospitalization for flu-like syndrome and hyperkaliemia) were not related to the antiviral treatment and 1 patient developed pancytopenia after 1 day of treatment (SOF+RBV) and the treatment was stopped. Conclusions: This preliminary experience in very difficult to treat patients shows that SOF in combination with DCV, SMV, RBV or PegIFN is safe and virological response seems to be promising.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Malnutrition is frequent in cirrhotic patients and is associated with a poor outcome. Role of malnutrition on the prognosis of hospitalized cirrhotic patients is incompletely studied. Aim To determine the prevalence of malnutrition, functional scores and their impact on prognosis of hospitalized cirrhotic patients. Methods This retrospective study included all consecutive patients with cirrhosis hospitalized in the gastroenterology unit at Saint-Luc university hospital from April 2014 to September 2014. Nutritional status was evaluated according to a score used in our centre including weight loss speed, reduction of intakes and body mass index (BMI). We also investigated the role of Charlson comorbidity index, Braden scale and Onodera’s Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) depending on both albumin and lymphocyte values. Cirrhosis-related complications or death occurrence were analysed in a one-year follow-up. Patients with unavailable nutritional data or with absence of follow-up were excluded. Results On 113 patients with cirrhosis, 18 were excluded, and the remaining 95 patients were assessed for nutritional status and outcomes. There were 71 men (74.8%). Mean age was 60 years (range 20-84 years). Aetiology of cirrhosis was alcoholic in 58.9%, hepatitis B or C virus in 29.5%, NAFLD in 5.3% and other causes in 6.3% of patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was present in 46.3% of patients. Mean BMI was 27.1 kg/m² ± 6.7. Diabetes mellitus was present in 36.8% of patients. Mean MELD was 13.4 ± 6.6 points. 40% of patients had a Child-Pugh A score, 41% a Child-Pugh B score and 19% a Child-Pugh C score. Malnutrition affected 45.3% of patients: 29% with Child-Pugh A, 48.8% with Child-Pugh B and 72.2% with Child-Pugh C. Mean Braden scale was 21.54 ± 2.25; 46.3% of patients had a Braden scale 15 (p<0.001), PNI <40 (p=0.003), Braden scale <23 (p=0.047) and malnutrition (p<0.001) were significantly associated with mortality. Adjusting for age, sodium, MELD, Charlson index, HCC, platelets, diabetes, PNI and Braden scale, malnutrition was significantly associated with higher mortality and morbidity rates with an OR of 3.56 (IC95 1.55-8.16) and 2.09 (IC95 1.16-3.77) respectively. Braden scale was significantly associated with higher mortality (p=0.027, OR 1.25, IC95 1.03-1.52) whereas PNI was associated with higher morbidity (p=0.001, OR 0.94, IC95 0.90-0.98). Conclusions Malnutrition is highly prevalent in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. Malnutrition, low PNI and low Braden scale are associated with poor outcomes in cirrhosis.",

Aim Treatment and outcomes in paediatric Crohn’s disease (CD) have not been compared between treating physician and centre of care. Methods Data from the BELCRO, an observational prospective cohort of children (< 18 yrs) diagnosed with CD in Belgium, were analysed. Disease severity was scored as inactive, mild and moderate-to-severe using a 3-point scale and monitored yearly. Remission was defined as inactive disease and sustained remission when achieved for ≥ 2 yrs follow-up (FU). Univariate analyses were performed between paediatric or adult and secondary or tertiary centre of care. Results A total of 91 children (median (IQR) age 12.7 (10.9 – 14.8) yrs, 53% male) were included. Disease location was 12% ileal, 23% colonic, 64% ileocolonic, 76% upper GI or 66% proximal (L4A) and 30% perianal. Disease severity at diagnosis was 25% mild and 75% moderate-to-severe. Level of care was 70% paediatric and 71% tertiary. Younger age (11.9 (9.8 – 13.4) vs. 15.1 (13.8 – 16.7) yrs; p< 10-7) and location L4A (77% vs. 41%; p= .02) were associated with paediatrics. Young age was associated with lower disease severity (11.4 (8.7 - 13.8) yrs for mild and 13.2 (11.6 – 15.3) yrs for moderate-to-severe; p= .02). Time to biological (1.5 (0.7 – 2.6) vs. 0.6 (0.4 – 1.4); p= .003) and combination (18.5 (8.0 – 32.5) vs. 7.0 (3.0 – 12.0); p= .006) therapy was longer and duration on biologicals (3.6 (2.0 – 4.4) vs. 4.6 (2.6 – 5.0); p= .01) was shorter in paediatrics. Biological (60% vs. 26%; p= .008) and combination (65% vs. 26%: p= .005) therapy were initiated more often after first remission by paediatricians. Rate of sustained remission (95% vs. 67%; p< .001) was higher for paediatric but similar for tertiary care. Time to first (0.7 (0.3 - 1.4) vs. 1.2 (0.7 – 2.5); p= .01) and sustained (2.6 (2.1 – 3.2) vs. 3.1 (2.5 – 3.9); p< .05) remission was shorter and duration of sustained remission (2.8 (1.6 – 4.2) vs. 2.1 (1.3 – 3.5); p= .004) was longer in paediatrics. Mean disease severity during 5 yrs FU (1.5 (1.3 – 1.8) vs. 1.8 (1.6 – 2.0); p= .008) was lower in paediatrics. Rate of inactive disease after 5 yrs of FU (73% vs. 56%; p= .09) was similar with more ongoing immunomodulator treatment (56% vs. 33%; p< .05) in paediatric compared to adult care. Conclusions Paediatric care is associated with longer delay to and shorter duration on biological or combination therapy with better disease control, using a step-up approach. However, outcomes after 5 years are similiar with adult care and use of top-down strategies for more severe disease course in older patients.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aim\r\n\r\nGastric acidic abnormalities are related to various types of diseases in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection status. However, no studies have shown correlations between many tiny endoscopic findings and the acid secretion level simultaneously. In the present study, we investigated predictive tiny endoscopic findings of hyperchlorhydria and hypochlorhydria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nA total of 223 subjects without organic diseases who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic gastrin test (EGT) for estimating gastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretory response between 1999 and 2012 at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. Two blinded expert endoscopists reviewed the images independently and recorded the endoscopic findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAccording to the EGT values, the enrolled subjects were categorized into hyperchlorhydria, normal acid secretion, and hypochlorhydria groups. In all subjects, hematin (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 3.32 [1.40–7.84]) and antral erosion(2.88 [1.24–6.70]) were the predictive endoscopic findings for hyperchlorhydria, and swelling of areae gastricae (14.4 [5.74–36.1]) and open-type atrophy (15.1 [7.35–31.1]) were those for hypochlorhydria. In addition, the predictive endoscopic findings for hyperchlorhydria differed according to the H. pylori infection status, hematin in H. pylori-positive subjects and antral erosion in H. pylori-negative subjects, in contrast to those for hypochlorhydria, which were the same irrespective of the H. pylori infection status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nWe could predict the acid secretion status based on the endoscopic findings regardless of H. pylori infection status, which would be of some help for evaluating the risk for acid-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is characterized by diffuse pancreatic enlargement and irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct (MPD). Immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) associated with AIP frequently appears as a bile duct stricture. Therefore, it is important to differentiate AIP and IgG4-SC from pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma or primary sclerosing cholangitis, respectively. Endoscopy plays a central role in the diagnosis of AIP and IgG4-SC because it provides imaging of the MPD and bile duct strictures as well as the ability to obtain tissue samples for histological evaluations. Diffuse irregular narrowing of MPD on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is rather specific to AIP, but localized narrowing of the MPD is often difficult to differentiate from MPD stenosis caused by pancreatic cancer. A long stricture (>1/3 the length of the MPD) and lack of upstream dilatation from the stricture (<5 mm) might be key features of AIP on ERCP. Some cholangiographic features, such as segmental strictures, stric tures of the lower bile duct, and long strictures with prestenotic dilatation, are more common in IgG4-SC than in cholangiocarcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) reveals diffuse hypoechoic pancreatic enlargement, sometimes with hypoechoic inclusions, in patients with AIP. In addition, EUS-elastography and contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS have been developed with promising results. The usefulness of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration has been increasingly recognized for obtaining adequate tissue samples for the histological diagnosis of AIP. Further improvement of endoscopic procedures and devices will contribute to more accurate diagnosis of AIP and IgG4-SC.",

    "abstract": "Dysplasia designate the presence in a tissue of atypical architectural and cytological features similar to those observed in cancerisation. It must be clearly distinguished from metaplasia which is, in itself, a benign state caracterized by the progressive replacement of a normal tissue by an other, normally foreign to this organ. Although the theoretical definition of dysplasia and its relation to cancerisation is well demonstratred, numerous difficulties remain regarding its classification and clinical applications. Recent researchs based on follow-up studies and on diagnostic reproductibility have somewhat clarified the problem, leading to a simplification of the classification in two tiers (high and low grade). High grade dysplasia can be considered as a high cancer risk necessitating a follow-up at short intervals and possibly requiring surgery. Low grade dysplasia, which can regress or progress very slowly represents a low cancer risk. After a first control at one or two months, it is suggested that endoscopic follow-up can be proposed at larger intervals (one or two years). The authors study the aspects of the dysplasia at the different levels of the gastrointestinal tract and summarise the clinical implication of this diagnosis.",

We held the 104th conference of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society Kinki chapter on the web for the first time. As a result, there were more registrations for participation than at previous conferences, and we received many good evaluations for the conference held on the web, such as participants being able to browse any subject at any time and preference for the web conference by distant participants. On the other hand, the greatest weakness was that the presenters and participants could not hold discussions. We report the progress of holding the conference on the web and the results of the questionnaire that was distributed after the conference.",

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has rapidly increased in recent years and BE has been found to be present as a precursor lesion in many of these cases. Patient’s with BE are thought to have an annual risk of developing esophageal cancer of 0.5% per year, substantially higher than the general population, but the absolute risk of developing cancer in BE patients is low. Endoscopic screening of subjects with chronic reflux symptoms has been recommended as a method of detecting BE and early cancer and despite the lack of clinical evidence, BE patients are then routinely enrolled in surveillance programs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: A link between serum hepatokine levels (proteins produced by the liver and acting distantly) and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has been recently suggested. Here, we wanted to explore the liver expression of several hepatokines at the initiation of a high fat diet in mice, as well as their relation with liver macrophage (Kupffer cell) activation. Material and methods: Male mice of 5 weeks of age were fed a normal diet (ND) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 3 days, known to induce steatosis and insulin resistance. A preventive Kupffer cell (KC) depletion was obtained by intravenous injection of clodronate loaded liposomes and compared with PBS liposomes. The mRNA expression of hepatokines (selenoprotein-P, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor 21, angiopoietin-like protein 3) was evaluated by RT-PCR on liver tissue. Results: Short term HFD induced steatosis, KC activation and insulin resistance with a significant increased expression of selenoprotein P (1.6 fold, p<0.001), fetuin-A (1.7 fold, p<0.01) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (9 fold, p<0.01). However, the liver expression of angiopoietin-like protein 3 remains unchanged under short term HFD. Kupffer cell depletion in this setting did not reduce hepatic steatosis but significantly ameliorated insulin sensitivity proved by clamp studies. This amelioration in insulin sensitivity in KC-depleted mice was associated with a significant decrease in fetuin A mRNA expression (0.7 fold, p<0.001) compared to animals with KC. Interestingly, while selectively depleting liver macrophages without affecting adipose tissue macrophage infiltration, intravenous clodronate injection was associated with a significant reduction in epididymal adipose tissue expansion compared to PBS injection (1.1% of body weight versus 1.6% of body weight, p<0.001), suggesting a role of liver-derived products in peripheral tissue alterations associated with obesity. Conclusions: We demonstrate liver hepatokine overexpression at the initiation of HFD feeding, concurrent with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Targeting KC in this setting improved insulin sensitivity and was associated with a decreased adiposity and a reduced liver fetuin A expression. The impact of this hepatokine on adipose tissue metabolism needs to be confirmed and the search for pathogenic liver-derived factors in obesity associated disorders intensified.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : A subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients presents with synchronous or metachronous metastasis confined to the peritoneal surfaces. These patients may benefit from cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC).\r\nAim : We reviewed the morbidity and survival associated with this multimodal approach.\r\nMethods : Colorectal cancer patients with potentially resectable peritoneal metastases were evaluated. Patients with low grade appendiceal tumours including the pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) syndrome were excluded from the analysis. Staging consisted of CT and PET-CT ; laparoscopy was rarely performed. Neoadjuvant therapy was prescribed in patients with extensive disease. All patients underwent cytoreduction including peritonectomy procedures as indicated. When optimal resection was achieved, HIPEC was performed with the open abdomen technique and using oxaliplatin 460 mg/m2 during 30 min at 40-41°C. All consecutive patients were included in the analysis. Overall survival was estimated with the Kaplan Meier method, and multivariate modeling of overall survival was performed with Cox proportional hazards analysis. Statistical significance was assumed whenever the probability of a type I error was < 5%.\r\nResults : In a 7 year period, 123 patients, age 59 (SD :12) and 50% male were treated. In 25 patients (20%), peritoneal metastases were synchronous with the primary tumour. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed to 53% of patients. The mean duration of the combined procedure was 8.9 (SD : 2.6) hours. Postoperative mortality was 1.6%, and major complications (requiring prolonged stay and/or reintervention) occurred in 34%. Median hospital stay was 17 days (range 8-169). After a median follow up of 16 months, median overall survival (OS) was 28 months, with a three year actuarial survival of 40.4%. In a multivariate model, the following variables were independently associated with OS : completeness of cytoreduction, tumour differentiation, and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nConclusion : A multimodal approach consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and HIPEC results in a meaningful survival benefit in patients with peritoneal metastases from CRC. In a referral center, the procedure can be performed with low operative mortality and acceptable morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Despite improved screening programs and modern treatments, colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains the third most common cancer in men and women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The development of CRC is characterised by several genetic and epigenetic alterations. There is still a high rate of recurrence and metastases with a remaining need for identification of molecular biomarkers in order to predict the evolution of the disease.\r\nAim : Our aim was to characterise copy number alterations in different subgroups of colon cancer patients.\r\nMethods : Genetic alterations were analysed using Array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (array-CGH) in 100 resection tissues of colon tumours. The tumour DNA was isolated with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. Megapool reference DNA was used as normal control. Tumour DNA was labelled with the fluorescent dye Cy3 and the normal control was labelled with Cy5. After labelling the DNA, it was hybridised to a SurePrintG3 Human CGH Microarray, 4 × 180 K. The scanned images were analysed with an in-house developed software program, arrayCGHbase.\r\nResults : In the studied patient population, 3-year survival and recurrence of disease were correlated with the stage of colon cancer but not with tumour localisation. Preliminary results showed a significant correlation (p < 0,001) between the number of genetic alterations and overall survival of the patients (n = 100). The most prevalent copy number alterations in CRC as described in literature, were confirmed in our samples, for instance gain of chromosomes 7, 13 and 20 and losses of chromosomes 4 and 18. Moreover, we found alterations residing in a number of new interesting chromosome regions. Future analyses will have to reveal the clinical relevance in colon. cancer.\r\nConclusion : The number of copy number alterations is associated with the overall survival of colon cancer patients. The new findings will be further investigated in depth. The link between KRAS and MSI status and the copy number alterations in the tumours will also be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Neoadjuvant multimodality treatment confers a survival benefit in locally advanced oesophageal cancer patients. The optimal dose of radiotherapy (RT) remains undefined.\r\nAim : To analyse the effect of RT dose on surgical outcome and survival in patients treated with multimodality treatment followed by surgery in locally advanced oesophageal cancer.\r\nMethods : This was a retrospective comparative study based on a prospectively collected database. Patients with clinical stage III oesophageal cancer were treated with a combination of RT, cisplatin 80 mg/m2, and 5-FU 800 mg/m2. Radiation dose was 36 Gy (group 1) or 45-50 Gy (group 2), depending on the referring physician. Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy was performed after a 6-8 weeks period. Surgical and pathological outcome was compared using Fisher exact test. Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were calculated using the Kaplan Meier method, and the effect of RT dose on survival was tested using univariate (log rank test) analysis.\r\nResults : A total of 134 patients were evaluated : 108 received 36 Gy, and 26 received 45-50 Gy. Mean age at surgery was 61 ± 9.43 years, and 84% were male. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was 17 days. Overall postoperative 30 day or in hospital mortality was 7.5%, and anastomotic leakage occurred in 4.1% ; neither was influenced by RT dose. Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 15.5% (group 1) and 31% (group 2), P = 0.09. No differences were observed in downstaging of either the T stage or the N stage. Overall five year OS and DFS were 35.1% and 38.3% respectively. In univariate analysis, a higher RT dose was associated with a significantly better DFS (P = 0.01), but not OS (P = 0.6).\r\nConclusion : In patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation, a higher RT dose does not affect surgical outcome, enhances pCR rate and improves DFS without affecting OS.",

Results: A total of 2605 patients with a confirmed IBD diagnosis were included in this study. Of these, 981 patients (38%) used 5-ASA, 315 patients (12%) used thiopurines, 459 patients (18%) used both 5-ASA and thiopurines and 850 patients (33%) used none of these drugs. No statistically significant differences were found for type of IBD, gender, age, duration of IBD and extent of IBD between these groups. Thirty-one patients (1%) developed advanced neoplasia during 16,568 person years of follow-up. Of these, 12 patients (39%) had used 5-ASA, 2 (7%) thiopurines and 1 (3%) both drugs. Increasing age and disease involvement of more than 50% of the colon were associated with an increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.11 and adjusted HR 5.88, 95% CI 2.00-17.3, respectively). Thiopurine use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing advanced neoplasia (adjusted HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.73). 5ASA therapy had also a protective effect on developing advanced neoplasia, but this was not statistically significant (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20-1.26). Conclusion: Thiopurine use protects colitis patients against the development of advanced neoplasia. The effect of 5ASA appeared to be less pronounced.",

    "abstract": "Background. Ghrelin released from the stomach, stimulates food intake through stimulation of neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus. Several studies proposed a pivotal role for the energy sensor AMPK and UCP2 in ghrelin's effects on NPY/AgRP expression and food intake stimulation, although most of these studies focused on the effects of exogenous ghrelin. Aim. To investigate whether a rise in endogenous ghrelin levels is able to influence NPY/AgRP expression via activation of AMPK activity and UCP2 expression. Methods. Endogenous ghrelin levels were increased in wildtype (GHS-R+/+) and ghrelin receptor knockout (GHS-R-/-) mice by fasting (24h) or by induction of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetes (15 days). Plasma octanoylated ghrelin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. The mRNA expression of AgRP, NPY and UCP2 in the hypothalamus was measured by real-time PCR. Hypothalamic AMPK activity in tissue lysates was measured with an immunoprecipitation kinase assay. Results.Octanoylated ghrelin levels peaked (4.5fold, P<0.01) after 24h of fasting and declined thereafter due to a decrease (1.7-fold, P<0.01) in the mRNA expression of ghrelin-O-acyl transferase (GOAT). GHS-R+/+ mice showed a significant increase in AgRP mRNA (from 0.33±0.03 to 1.03±0.09; P<0.001) and NPY mRNA (from 0.54 ± 0.08 to 0.88 ± 0.05; P<0.01) expression after 24h-fasting. In GHS-R-/mice no significant increase in AgRP and NPY mRNA expression was observed. Fasting did not affect AMPK activity in both genotypes but increased UCP2 mRNA expression (GHS-R+/+: from 0.35±0.05 to 0.50±0.04; P<0.05 and GHS-R-/-: from 0.41±0.04 to 0.55±0.08; P=0.058). The hyperghrelinemia associated with the induction of STZ-diabetes was accompanied by a significant increase in the expression of NPY and AgRP in GHS-R+/+ mice compared to nondiabetic controls (AgRP: from 0.22±0.12 to 2.74±0.45; P<0.001 and NPY: from 0.73±0.06 to 2.23±0.64; P<0.05) but not in GHS-R-/mice. AMPK activity in the hypothalamus of GHSR+/+ mice after induction of diabetes (20.2±1.6 pmol/min/mg) was decreased (P<0.05) compared to non-diabetic littermates (16.3±1.3 pmol/min/mg) and there was no genotypic difference. Similarly, UCP2 mRNA levels were decreased after the induction of STZ-diabetes compared to control mice in both genotypes (GHS-R+/+: from 0.68±0.02 to 0.26±0.03; P<0.001 and GHS-R-/-: from 0.61±0.05 to 0.28±0.05; P<0.01). Conclusion. Increasing endogenous ghrelin levels by fasting and by induction of diabetes stimulates the expression of AgRP and NPY in the hypothalamus via interaction with the GHS-R. The change in AMPK activity and its downstream effector, UCP2, accompanying these changes in endogenous ghrelin levels occur independently from the GHS-R suggesting that AMPK and UCP2 do not play a major role in the orexigenic effect of endogenous ghrelin.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Nowadays, laparoscopic surgery is widely disseminated in developed countries, even in small primary hospitals. The spreading of laparoscopy in developing countries has not been as successful. The technological nature of laparoscopy, and the required specific laparoscopic tools and medical skills, may render the initiation of this approach difficult for the developing countries. Aim : We hypothesized that laparoscopy may be developed in the Cliniques Universitaires de Kinshasa (CUK), University of Kinshasa (UNIKIN) and may be cost-effective for the population, considering the reduction of the cost of the associated medications and of the length of hospital stay. The final aim of this program is to bring the benefits of laparoscopy to the population of DRC, by allowance of adequate training of the UNIKIN anaesthetists and surgical trainees, who in the future might have the opportunity to apply their knowledge in their own professional practice. We hypothesized also that the availability of adequate and modern equipment may reduce the incentive for the brain drain and may help to keep some highly trained doctors within DRC. Methods : In partnership with the university of Liege and the financial support of Wallonia region, a complete CUK team, including a surgeon (2 years training in Belgium), an anaesthetist and nurses, was trained in Belgium and then after in DRC. The laparoscopic equipment, adapted to the African conditions, was sent to Kinshasa, and three theoretical and practical missions of a Belgian team were organised over one year. Results : The CUK team performed 57 surgical laparoscopic procedures in the first 12 months, including 18 appendicectomies, 13 cholecystectomies, 8 hernia repairs, 5 laparoscopy explorations for peritoneal carcinoma assessment and biopsy, 3 procedures for catheter of peritoneal dialysis, 2 minors gynecologic procedures, 2 management of generalized peritonitis, 2 adhesiolysis, 2 abscess drainages, 1 rectal prolapse, and 1 cystocoele. No mortality and no postoperative infection were observed. After 12 months of local use, all the medical material was in perfect condition. In addition to surgery, this program allowed the improvement of the quality of anesthaesia for non laparoscopic procedure. Conclusion : This program demonstrated the development, accessibility and durability of such new approaches in developing countries. The interest for laparoscopy was demontrated in several hospitals of Kinshasa. The next step will include the development of GI endoscopy and abdominal imaging. The needs of the DRC population are profound. The DRC medical schools, isolated from the developed countries for more than 30 years, are in great need for support. All the University and non-University GI teams or individuals willing to join such a project, are welcome.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in computed axial tomography (CAT) techniques encompass shorter scanning time and data processing systems of higher sophistication. The faster spatial resolution that may be presently achieved is of special interest for liver investigations. The effect of respiratory or intestinal movements may be minimized or even completely prevented. In addition, sequential examinations may be carried out with sufficient speed for detailed dynamic studies. Well circumscribed lesions as small as 0.5 cm in diameter may be currently detected with adequate techniques involving timely exploration after contrast administration. We performed a series of 1,650 liver examinations in two institutions with CAT-scanners of five successive generations. Inconclusive or false positive results that were encountered in up to 10% of our initial cases were rarely seen with most recent equipment. Our findings included cysts, polycystoses, hydatid cysts, hematomas, abscesses, focal nodular hyperplasias, adenomas, hepatic carcinomas and metastases. These diseases may be accurately characterized with modern CAT scans and additional experience will conceivably further refine etiologic diagnoses made with this procedure.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With the advancements of minimal-invasive surgery, restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (RPC-IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasingly being performed laparoscopically. Through this approach, quality of life preserving principles of the procedure, developed during the laparotomy era, such as inferior mesenteric vessels, autonomic pelvic nerves and Riolan’s arcade preservation as well as mesenteric lengthening, could be maintained. Recently, single access laparoscopic surgery (SALS) has emerged as an evolution of the standard multiport laparoscopic approach offering a “single scar laparoscopic” alternative for RCP-IPAA. AIM: Assess the feasibility of RCP-IPAA through the SALS approach without modifying the basic principles of the procedure. METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively collected during our initial experience of SALS RPC-IPAA. RESULTS: In our colorectal surgery unit, RPC-IPAA has been performed by multiport laparoscopy for more than 10 years. Since the introduction of the SALS approach in August 2011, 24 colorectal procedures have been performed. Out of those, 4 UC patients (3 female, 1 male), with a median age of 22 years (17 – 38) and a median BMI of 20 kg/m (29 – 25) underwent SALS RPC-IPAA by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. A single-port device (Applied Medical®, Gel Point™) was positioned either peri-ombilically (n=2) or at the site of the temporary ileostomy (n=2). Median incision length was 4 cm (3,5 – 4). All the major principles of RCP-IPAA could be respected. On a subjective scale, intra-operative technical difficulty was perceived as intermediate by the surgeon accustomed to multiport laparoscopy. The colon and rectum were extracted through the SALS site. Pouch-anal anastomosis was hand-sewn and, in 2 patients, a diverting loop ileostomy was created at the SALS port site. There were no intra-operative complications, no conversions or additional ports required. One complication consisting in focal pouch dehiscence required suture reinforcement performed through redo SALS approach with uneventful recovery. There were no hospital readmissions within postoperative day 30. CONCLUSION: No technical modifications were necessary to perform RPC-IPAA through SALS approach. For experienced laparoscopic colorectal surgeons, SALS RPC-IPAA is feasible although technically more demanding than straight multiport laparoscopic RCP-IPAA. At this time, SALS may present cosmetic advantages and less trauma to the abdominal wall compared to the multiport laparoscopic RCP-IPAA. However, a randomized controlled trial is required to point out short and long-term advantages in comparison to multiport laparoscopic RCP-IPAA.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and aim: Intestinal epithelial barrier function is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it remains unclear whether this dysfunction is a primary event of IBD or a consequence ofmucosal inflammation. This study investigated the impact of anti-inflammatory therapy with infliximab on the colonic mucosal expression of genes related to intestinal epithelial barrier function in IBD patients using oligonucleotide arrays. Methods: The expression of 121 genes related to intestinal epithelial barrier function, including IBD candidate susceptibility genes, mucins, trefoils, E-cadherin, genes involved in the apical junction complex function, were investigated in colonic mucosal biopsies obtained at endoscopy from 43 IBD patients with active colitis (24 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 19 Crohn's disease (CD)) before and 4-6 weeks after first infliximab infusion. The patients were classified for response to infliximab based on endoscopic and histologic findings: 20 responders (12 CD and 8 UC) and 23 non-responders (7 CD and 16 UC). Six control patients undergoing colonoscopy for screening were included. Total RNA was isolated, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Microarray data was analyzed using Bioconductor software. Moderated t-statistic was used for comparative data analysis. A false discovery rate 2 fold-change were considered statistically significant. Results: There was no significant difference between UC and CD at baseline. In UC and CD, the mRNA expression levels of MUC1, MUC4, MUC5B, MCAM, TFF1, CLDN1, CLDN2, JAM2 and TLR4 were all upregulated at baseline compared to controls, while the mRNA expression levels of MUC20, CLDN23, CLDN8, MPP5, MPP7, CDH1, SLC22A4, SLC22A5, ABCB1 and PDZD3 were all downregulated at baseline compared to controls. In responders to anti-TNFalpha treatment, the expression levels of TFF1, TFF2, CLDN2, CLDN8, SORBS1, ABCB1 and DSG3 in UC and CLDN1 in UC and CD normalized after treatment. In CD (not in UC) responders, MUC1 and MUC4 mRNA expression remained increased and CXADR and SLC22A5 mRNA expression remained decreased after complete healing in comparison with controls. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that the expression of many barrier genes is dysregulated in the colon of active IBD. After healing of the mucosa with infliximab therapy, the expression of most of these genes was restored in UC, while in CD the expression of a number of barrier genes remained dysregulated.We do not find arguments for a primary defect in barrier in UC whereas in Crohn's disease some barrier defects persist in healed colonic mucosa.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) typically causes waterborne outbreaks of acute hepatitis in parts of the world with poor sanitation. However, HEV infection is now increasingly recognized as a cause of hepatitis in developed countries as well. This autochthonous hepatitis E is usually caused by genotype 3, which has been shown to have a high prevalence in pig populations worldwide and which may be transmitted zoonotically. Previous seroprevalence studies in Western Europe have yielded widely differing estimates, probably because of the variability in analytical performance of the assay used for detection of anti-HEV antibodies. The goal of this study is to provide an estimate of the seroprevalence of HEV in Belgium, since data for our country are currently lacking.\r\nPatients and methods: One hundred patients presenting to our hospital without gastroenterological problems were randomly selected to be tested for anti-HEV IgG antibodies. This was done using a sensitive indirect ELISA (Biorex, Antrim, United Kingdom) and, in the case of a borderline result, a strip immunoassay (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany) for confirmation.\r\nResults: The anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence was found to be 14%.\r\nDiscussion: Published seroprevalence rates of HEV in other Western European countries are as follows: 3.2% to 16.6% in France, 2.0% to 15.5% in Germany, 1.1% to 6.0% in the Netherlands, 5.3% to 16.2% in the UK and 0.8% to 7.3% in Spain. As pigs may serve as a reservoir for HEV infection in humans, we calculated pig/inhabitant ratios by dividing the number of pigs by the number of inhabitants for these countries (data from 2009). The pig/inhabitant ratio was 0.59 in Belgium, 0.23 in France, 0.33 in Germany, 0.73 in the Netherlands, 0.08 in the UK and 0.57 in Spain. It is clear from these data that a simple linear correlation between the seroprevalence of HEV and the pig/inhabitant ratio does not exist. However, it should be kept in mind that HEV seroprevalence rates from different studies are difficult to compare due to large differences in the analytical sensitivity of the available anti-HEV IgG assays.\r\nConclusions: The observed seroprevalence rate suggests that HEV infection is not an uncommon event in Belgium. Comparisons with published seroprevalence data of other Western European countries should be made with caution due to differences in the analytical performance of anti-HEV IgG assays.",

    "abstract": "Background: Recently, cigarette smoking has been associated with the development of several auto-immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The cellular and molecular mechanisms through which cigarette smoking predisposes to IBD are unknown. Cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis is described in several in vivo and in vitro experiments, and might play a role in the pathogenesis of several smoke-associated diseases. The aim of this study was to quantify apoptosis in normal murine Follicle-Associated Epithelium (FAE) and compare this to apoptosis in FAE of smoking mice.\r\nMethods: 8 C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to cigarette smoke for 24 weeks (chronic exposure); a control group of 8 mice was exposed to air during the same period. After 24 weeks the mice were sacrificed and Peyer’s patches of each mouse were dissected for histology. Immunohistochemistry for caspase-3 was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 11 Peyer’s patches of smoking animals and 11 Peyer’s patches of controls. To compare apoptotic activities between smokers and controls, the apoptotic index (percentage of apoptotic cells per 100 cells) in the FAE was calculated. An unpaired student T-test was applied.\r\nResults: A statistically significant increase in apoptosis of FAE cells was observed in smoking mice compared to air-exposed mice (P=0.002). In the FAE of smoking animals, the mean apoptotic index was 1.82 with a range of 1.11 to 3.00, whereas the mean apoptotic index in non-smoking animals was 0.92 (range 0.24 -2.06). Most apoptotic cells in both groups were seen at the apex of the FAE. \r\nConclusion: We quantified rates of apoptosis in the FAE of murine Peyer’s patches. Furthermore we compared apoptosis in the FAE of smoking mice versus non-smoking siblings and observed an increased apoptotic index in the FAE of smoking animals. Our results demonstrate that cigarette smoke induces a significant increase of apoptosis in the FAE of murine Peyer’s patches and may point to a role for smoking in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. Further investigation needs to clarify whether this increase in apoptosis influences normal function of the FAE.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Unsedated colonoscopy using water infusion has been performed in a US veterans population, showing feasibility and even enhanced adenoma detection rate (Leung et al, J Interv Gastroenterol, 2011, 1, 8-13). Avoiding sedation or general anesthesia theoretically will avoid sedation related complications, could be time- and cost-saving, could improve patient satisfaction and reduce waiting lists for colonoscopy.\r\nAim : To study the feasibility of unsedated colonoscopy by means of water infusion in a tertiary hospital setting. The primary endpoint of this trial is reaching the cecum without need for sedation.\r\nMethods : The water infusion technique for colonoscopy consists of using water at body temperature at insertion of the endoscope, instead of air insufflation. It is combined with removal of all residual colonic air by suction and residual feces by water exchange. Once the cecum is reached, air insufflation is used during withdrawal for mucosal inspection. All patients start the endoscopy unsedated but sedation and analgesia are administered if needed or asked for (midazolam 2,5 mg / pethidine 50 mg). When progression with water fails, switch to air insufflation is made. Pain scores are registred on a VAS (0=no pain, 10=maximal pain). Patient satisfaction and willing to repeat the procedure are also scored on a VAS (respectively: 0=very low, 10=high/ 0=not willing to repeat, 10=willing).\r\nResults : 38 patients (18F, 20M) with a mean age of 57 ± 11 yrs are included. Indications for colonoscopy are: cancer screening 24%, polyp surveillance 18%, diagnostic 58%. The primary endpoint, unsedated succesful cecal intubation, is reached in 27 patients (71,2%). The global cecal intubation rate is 94,7% (n=36). Mean insertion time was 14 ± 6 min. Mean length of the colonoscope at the cecum was 82 ± 10 cm. Mean volume of water infused upon arrival to the cecum is 332 ± 172 ml. In 11 patients (28,9%) temporary switch to air insufflation during insertion is needed (6 at the hepatic flexure, 5 in the sigmoid). Men reach the endpoint more readily than women (85% vs. 55,6%, p = 0,046). Age doesn’t make a difference (p = 0,62). Maximum mean pain score during insertion is 3,1 ± 2,7; pain at time of discharge is 1,5 ± 2,2. Patient satisfaction is 9,2 ± 1,2, willingness to repeat 9,7 ± 0,7. Mean withdrawal time is 8,8 + 4,6 min and the adenoma detection rate is 21%.\r\nConclusions : Water-infused colonoscopy is a promising and simple technique to perform complete unsedated colonoscopy. This method may open perspectives for a new era in colonoscopy with high patient satisfaction and lower costs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Today there is growing evidence supporting the benefit of 2nd line chemotherapy after gemcitabine failure in pancreatic cancer. However, which type of chemotherapy is preferred has not been defined yet. Different therapeutic regimens have been tested in small trials and have shown a limited significant clinical benefit. In Belgium, combination chemotherapy of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) + leucovorin according to the modified de Gramont schedule is the treatment of choice. Combination therapy with cisplatinum and 5FU has yielded positive results in 3 trials.\r\nAim : We analyzed retrospectively the data in two Belgian centres in a non-selected population.\r\nMethods : Between January 2004 and October 2011, 48 patients with histologically proven recurrent, or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had received cisplatin and 5FU - leucovorin (modified de Gramont) as 2nd line therapy were identified. We retrospectively analyzed the following parameters : progression free survival and overall survival for each line (after the start of 1st and 2nd line). We also assessed the efficacy of the 2nd line regimen by the growth modulation index or progression free survival ratio.\r\nResults : The median progression free survival after the start of 1st line was 5,4 months (95% CI 4,1 - 6,6). The median progression free survival after the start of 2nd line was 3,6 months (95% CI 1,8-5,5). More interestingly, the median overall survival after the start of 1st line was 12 months (95% CI 9,4-14,6). The 2- and 1-year survival rate after the start of 1st line therapy were 8% (4/48) and 50% (24/48), respectively. Twenty three percent of patients had a growth modulation index > 1,33, referring to a benefit in progression free survival of 2nd line therapy that was greater than that of treatment in 1st line.\r\nConclusions : We show an overall survival close to 12 months with cisplatinum-5FU in 2nd line therapy in a retrospective analysis, an overall survival that is higher than what has been described before. This good result was not due to selection of a patient population that responds well to chemotherapy, since 23% of patients showed a longer progression free survival in 2nd line than in 1st line. These results are in agreement with what is found in the literature : both combination therapy with oxaliplatin and cisplatin show promising results in pancreatic cancer. Oxaliplatin may be preferred because of its lower toxicity, but a recent meta-analysis shows more efficacy for cisplatin. Sequential therapy with good overall survival and good quality of life may be preferred to strong upfront therapy in an incurable disease such as pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) is one of the most disturbing side effects of chemotherapy with respect to the patient’s quality of life, often dose-limiting if not calling into question the entire therapeutic strategy. CID prevention could enhance treatment safety and outcome by enabling the administration of optimal therapeutic doses. Diarrhea prevention is a major challenge for future oncological therapies, as CID is a frequent side effect of modern biological agents. In this multicentric, Belgian, prospective non-randomized trial, we tested the secondary prevention of CID with long-acting octreotide (LAO) in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy associated with a high risk of digestive toxicity.\r\nMethods : In the study’s observational phase, all patients treated with a high-risk chemotherapy regimen were prospectively screened after having provided written consent. Patients experiencing a CID = 2 were proposed to enter the interventional phase, after having signed a second informed consent. They received a monthly Sandostatin LAR30 IM injection and the next chemotherapy course was administered with a 25% dose decrease. If no grade = 2 CID occurred, subsequent chemotherapy doses were increased to the initial 100% values. The main endpoint of the study was the diarrhea control rate for patients participating in the interventional phase of the study and receiving the optimal dose of chemotherapy for a minimum of 2 cycles. The statistical plan used a 2-step Simon design, with a first step after successful secondary CID prevention in 19 out of 25 patients. LAO would be considered as efficient in secondary prevention of CID if no diarrhea > grade 1 had been observed in at least 62 out of 79 patients treated with full-dose chemotherapy.\r\nResults : From March 2007 to March 2009, a total of 57 patients were included in the trial. The study was terminated before reaching its target size population because of poor accrual. 29 patients did not develop any CID and participated only in the observational phase. Of the 28 patients included in the interventional part after the first onset of a = grade 2 CID, 5 patients (17.8%, 95% CI = 6.1% - 36.9%) experienced no improvement after a 25% decrease in chemotherapy dose. 9 patients (32.1%, 95% CI = 15.9% - 52.4%) did not continue for the following reasons : rapid tumor progression (7), local reaction after LAO injection (1) and refusal (1). The screen failure rate is thus 14/28 (50%, 95% CI = 30.6% - 69.4%). Of the 14 patients whose CID was resolved after chemotherapy dose reduction, only 2 experienced a = grade 2 CID recurrence after receiving full dose chemotherapy. The remaining 12 patients were treated at the optimal chemotherapy dose without significant digestive side effects (85.7%, 95% CI = 57.2% - 98.2%). The overall success rate of the tested strategy is 12/28 (42.8%, 95% CI = 24.5% - 62.8%).\r\nConclusions : While this trial did not recruit enough patients to answer the study question, available data suggest that LOA is very effective in allowing the return to optimal doses of chemotherapy in patients whose moderate to severe CID was improved after an initial chemotherapy dose reduction. Moreover, the high rate of screen failures emphasizes the need for more aggressive management of acute CID in addition to secondary prevention.",

    "abstract": "Summary Gastric-type epithelium and islands of oxyntic mucosa in duodenal biopsies are considered by some to be part of a spectrum of metaplastic change related to disorders. This study was designed to assess prevalence and associations of metaplastic-heterotopic gastric mucosa in the duodenum. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data from patients who had duodenal biopsy specimens for a 12-month period were collected from a national database. The duodenal findings of patients with duodenitis, gastric metaplasia, and gastric heterotopia were correlated with gastric pathology, Helicobacter pylori status, and clinical information. Of 28 210 patients with duodenal biopsy specimens, 80.9% were healthy, 2.1% had active duodenitis, 2.2% gastric foveolar metaplasia without active inflammation (peptic duodenopathy), 4.8% gastric foveolar metaplasia with active inflammation (peptic duodenitis), and 1.9% gastric heterotopia. Helicobacter pylori was documented in 9.8% of patients with normal duodenum, 6.9% of those with gastric metaplasia without active inflammation, 15.8% of those with active duodenitis, and 29.1% of those with gastric foveolar metaplasia with active inflammation; 2.2% of 543 patients with gastric heterotopia had H pylori gastritis. Helicobacter pylori was detected in the metaplastic epithelium of 67.6% of patients with active inflammation and in 16.4% of those with metaplasia without inflammation. Gastric heterotopia was strongly associated with concurrent fundic gland polyps. In conclusion, active was more common in patients with H pylori infection, but gastric metaplasia was not. We suggest that there is insufficient evidence to ascribe with foveolar metaplasia to a disorder, as peptic duodenopathy and peptic duodenitis seem to imply. Gastric heterotopia is likely a congenital lesion; its association with fundic gland polyps suggests that use of proton pump inhibitors may enhance its endoscopic detection.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Near-infrared (IR) rays, because of their limited scattering characteristics and low absorption by water and hemoglobin, can penetrate deeply into tissue. Using infrared rays, we have developed an infrared electronic endoscope system and evaluated its usefulness for assessing the depth of involvement of gastric cancers. Recently, we developed a new infrared videoendoscopic system (dual wavelength system). With this system, we can recognize submucosal vessels of gastric cancers in a greater detail with higher resolution under IR light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  A total of 30 patients with depressed gastric cancers underwent infrared endoscopy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Twenty-one (91%) of 23 intramucosal and submucosal cancers less than 1000 µm were observed as tumors with no stain or faint stain, whereas all (100%) of seven more invasive cancers were observed as tumors with dense stain or pooling of the dye. Thus, the overall accuracy was 93% (28 of 30 tumors). Moreover, 95% (18 of 19) of tumors with ulcerative changes were correctly diagnosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions:  New infrared electronic endoscopic system is useful for diagnosing the depth of involvement of early gastric cancer either with or without ulcerative changes. This system will bring us further development in the diagnosis of gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Mucosal surface roughness is the element of Matts grading system for endoscopic severity of ulcerative colitis. The aims of the present study were to develop an image-processing method for quantifying mucosal surface roughness and to evaluate performance of this method by comparison with visually assessed surface roughness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  A total of 139 digitized colonoscopic pictures from 69 randomly selected patients with ulcerative colitis were used. The red frame of the endoscopic picture was processed for the mean spatial gradient reflecting the surface roughness. Three endoscopists (E1, E2, E3), unaware of the study design were asked to assess the surface roughness by using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 1. A total of three sessions for surface roughness were performed by each endoscopist on different days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  The overall mean gradient was 28.9 ± 10.9. The mean VAS did not significantly differ among endoscopists (0.42 ± 0.23 for E1, 0.45 ± 0.19 for E2 and 0.43 ± 0.28, P > 0.05). The correlation coefficient of VAS between E1 and E2, between E2 and E3, and between E3 and E1 was 0.957 (P < 0.0001), 0.914 (P < 0.0001) and 0.950 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The mean gradient correlated with the averaged VAS for each endoscopist (r = 0.711 for E1, P < 0.0001; 0.672 for E2, P < 0.0001; 0.826 for E3, P < 0.0001).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  This method may provide a means for mucosal surface roughness as a pictorial parameter, regardless of the organ studied.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of NSAIDs enteropathy in subjects indicated for double-balloon endoscopy (DBE). Material and methods. The Japanese Study Group for Double-Balloon Endoscopy (JSG-DBE) established a database for the practical use of DBE in the Japanese population during a 2-year period from 2004 to 2005. Using this database, we identified subjects who had been taking NSAIDs within a month prior to DBE (NSAIDs group) and those free from NSAIDs use (control group). The clinical background and DBE findings were compared between the two groups. Results. Among 1035 patients registered in the JSG-DBE database, 61 subjects were classified as the NSAIDs group and 600 served as the control group. Patients in the NSAIDs group were older (62±18 versus 51±19 years, p<0.0001) and gastrointestinal bleeding was a more frequent indication for DBE (79% versus 44%, p<...",

Angiography showed an abnormal mass in the head of the pancreas. Before surgery, subcutaneous injections (100 micrograms every 8 hours) of the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide or SMS 201-995, were administered in order to stabilize the clinical status of the patient and to reduce the intravenous administration of fluid and electrolytes. This treatment resulted in prompt relief of the symptoms and in a partial decrease of the plasma levels of VIP and PP. At subsequent laparotomy, there was a tumour localized in the head of the pancreas, which was completely removed by Whipple resection. The immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of VIP and PP inside the tumour cells. Two years after surgical resection, the patient is healthy without clinical or laboratory evidence of recurrence.",

    "abstract": "In order to evaluate the benefit of arterialization of the portal vein in conjunction with a therapeutic end-to-side porto-caval shunt, we started in December 1979 a prospective randomized study, comparing these two techniques in Child class A and B cirrhotic patients with a hepatopetal portal flow of at least 100 ml per min. Sixty-four patients have been included in the study: 33 underwent a porto-caval shunt (NART) and 31 were arterialized (ART). The two groups of patients were similar as regards clinical and hemodynamic parameters. The operative mortality was lower after arterialization, considering the whole group (ART: 6.5%, NART: 12%) and high risk patients (Child class B: ART: 0%, NART: 22%--emergency operation: ART: 0%, NART: 17%) but the differences were not statistically significant. Postoperative ascites was more frequent in arterialized patients (ART: 45%, NART: 18%; p = 0.02), with an increased need for reoperation (ART: 26%, NART: 6%; p less than 0.05). The mean follow-up period is 56.9 +/- 28.1 months (SD) for the 58 surviving patients. The five-year actuarial survival rate is 68% for ART patients and 60.6% for NART patients (NS). In child B patients the five-year actuarial survival rate is 75% in ART patients and 22% in NART patients (p less than 0.05). Actuarial estimation of arterialization patency--proved by angioscan--is 38% at five years. There were no significant differences in the incidences of postoperative and long-term encephalopathy and liver function between the two groups. In conclusion, arterialization of the portal vein in conjunction with a therapeutic end-to-side porto-caval shunt improved survival in high risk patients (Child class B), did not increase operative mortality in Child A and B patients, was followed by a higher incidence of postoperative ascites and did not decrease the incidence of long-term encephalopathy.",

Combined electrodes offer most advantages. Ambulatory recording should be done in hospital under standard conditions (meals), particularly for clinical studies. The best clinical indication is to detect pathological reflux in case of atypical symptoms with negative oesophagoscopy. The authors give their normal values in a series of measurements with two systems as well as their results in a series of cases of oesophagitis of various grades.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas has a broad spectrum of histology ranging from hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the malignant and benign lesions to determine the therapeutic strategy for IPMT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and Methods:  Thirty-nine patients with IPMT (27 men and 12 women, mean age: 63.3 years) underwent surgery between January 1985 and March 2002. The size of the cystic lesion, the maximum diameter of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), and the height of the papillary tumor inside the cyst were investigated by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) before operation. These preoperative clinical findings were compared with the pathological findings of the resected specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  The size of the cystic lesion, the diameter of MPD, and the height of the papillary tumor in cases with malignant IPMT (invasive and non-invasive carcinoma) were larger than those in cases with benign IPMT (adenoma and hyperplasia). Analysis of the images of the lesions revealed that the following three factors are important for diagnosing IPMT: (i) the size of the cystic lesion is ≥ 30 mm; (ii) the diameter of MPD is ≥ 8 mm; (iii) the height of the papillary tumor inside the cyst is ≥ 3 mm. It was not significant to differentiate between benign and malignant IPMT based on factor (i), but statistically significant (P < 0.001) based on factors (ii) and (iii).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions:  EUS and IDUS are useful in the differential diagnosis of IPMT, especially in the differentiation between malignant and benign IPMT.",

    "abstract": "Background and aim:  Pouchitis is one of the late complications of restorative proctocolectomy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and is associated with increased bowel frequency. The present study aimed to clarify the endoscopic findings that are associated with bowel frequency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and methods:  The macroscopic and microscopic features in the ileum proximal to the pouch, the pouch, and the remnant short rectum in 100 endoscopies on 63 patients were studied retrospectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Four of 28 (14%) patients had inflammatory changes in the proximal ileum. Sixty-seven percent of patients showed an abnormal appearance of the pouch. Granularity, friability, presence of mucus, erythema, and erosions were significantly related to bowel frequency. ‘Endoscopic pouch activity index’ (EPAI), which is the number of positive findings of diffuse erythema, mucus, friability, ulcer, erosion, and granularity, was strongly associated with bowel frequency (P < 0.0001). Patients without macroscopic inflammation in the rectum had significantly lower bowel frequency than those with mild or moderately active inflammation (P = 0.0294 and 0.0183, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that ‘endoscopic pouch activity index’ and histological grade of pouch inflammation were significant factors (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0429, respectively) influencing bowel frequency. Time–course study demonstrated that changes in EPAI and macroscopic grade of the rectum were significantly related to alteration in bowel frequency (P = 0.0120 and 0.0244, respectively).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  Erythema, mucus discharge and granularity were significantly related to bowel frequency. EPAI may be useful to evaluate endoscopic pouch inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Microwave or radiofrequency ablation therapy has been widely perfomed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whereas ablation therapy is effective treatment, it cannot be perfomed easily, as is evident in several reports of severe complications. We treated surface-type HCC under laparoscopy in avoidance of complications from March 1996. In the present study, we examined the efficacy and long-term outcome of laparoscopic ablation therapy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and Methods:  The patients were 47 cases (58 lesions) of HCC treated by laparoscopic ablation therapy under general anesthesia in our Center from March 1996 until March 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  The surface-type HCC to which the therapy was applicable accounted for approximately 15% of all cases. The overall 5-year survival rate was 62%. Hepatic reserve and rate of intrahepatic recurrences in the remnant liver after curative treatment were the limiting factors on the survival rate. There was no serious complication in the treatment. It was well tolerated and brought about good quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  Laparoscopic ablation therapy was considered to be an easy and effective approach, and its utility was also recognized in the avoidance of the problems of percutaneous treatment, such as bleeding or damage to the adjacent organs.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Endoscopic color Doppler ultrasonography (ECDUS) is a useful modality for obtaining color ﬂow images of esophageal varices. The direction of blood ﬂow in passageways is fundamentally hepatofugal ﬂow according to ECDUS. The present study is designed to evaluate the alternate direction of color ﬂow image of passageways via ECDUS in esophageal variceal patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  The study involved 125 patients with esophageal varices using ECDUS. The grades of red color (RC) were as follows: RC(+) in 79 cases, RC(+ +) in 35 cases, and RC(+ + +) in 11 cases. We investigated the alternate direction on color ﬂow images of the left gastric vein, the palisade vein, and the perforating veins via ECDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Color ﬂow images of the esophageal varices and the left gastric vein were obtained in all 125 (100%) patients by ECDUS. Color ﬂow images of the perforating veins were obtained in 90 (72.0%) of the 125 patients. Vessel images of the palisade veins were detected in 33 (26.4%) of the 125 patients. The alternate direction on color ﬂow images was detected in seven (5.6%) of the 125 patients with ECDUS: in three patients, left gastric vein; in three patients, perforating veins; and in one patients, left gastric vein and palisade veins. This phenomenon was observed periodically at regular intervals. The endoscopic ﬁndings were RC(+) in all seven patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  The alternate direction of blood ﬂow in the passageways was observed in a few cases of RC(+) esophageal varices. We can observe the hemodynamics of esophageal varices non-invasively and in real time with ECDUS, and clarify the frequencies of the alternate direction of blood ﬂow in RC-positive esophageal variceal patients.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation (EPBD) is one of the methods to remove bile duct stones. EPBD might preserve the function of the sphincter of Oddi despite the potential risk of acute pancreatitis. There are only a few reports of EPBD reducing the risk of acute pancreatitis and, at same time, preserving the function of the sphincter of Oddi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  We performed EPBD for bile duct stone removal in 60 patients using two balloons with different diameters. Patients were randomized to EPBD with a 6 mm balloon (n = 30) or an 8 mm balloon (n = 30). In both groups, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) was infused in a rate of 5 mg/h while low pressure EPBD were being performed. The pressure of the sphincter of Oddi was observed before and after the EPBD procedures. Also, serum amylase level after EPBD was observed for both groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Serum amylase level of the 6 mm group was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the 8 mm group (P < 0.05). Acute pancreatitis occurred in two patients ( 6.7%) in the 6 mm group whereas no case was observed for the 8 mm group. The rates of duct clearance were 93% in the 6 mm group and 100% in the 8 mm group. Stone removals were difﬁcult in seven cases with 6 mm balloon dilatations due to the narrow oriﬁces of the papilla. In the 6 mm group, there was no signiﬁcant difference between the basal sphincter of Oddi pressure (BSOP) and the phasic sphincter of Oddi pressure (PSOP) before and after EPBD. However in the 8 mm group, the BSOP observed after the EPBD procedure was signiﬁcantly higher than BSOP before the treatments. Within this group, BSOP values after EPBD were preserved by approximately 80% of the BSOP values before the treatments. In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant difference in PSOP before and after the treatments. Regarding the stone numbers, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in BSOP before and after the treatments for the 6 mm group with less than two stones. Also, as for stone size, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in BSOP before and after the treatments for the 6 mm group with stones of less than 6 mm in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  We are now conducting EPBD with ISDN infusion using a 6 mm balloon for a patient who has less than two stones with size not exceeding 6 mm in diameter. An 8 mm balloon is used for a patient with more than two stones or a stone greater than 6 mm in size.",

    "abstract": "Background:  The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of reddish markings appearing on the surface of the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  Subjects were patients with Hepatitis B virus-related (n = 232) or Hepatitis C-related (n = 246) chronic liver disease. Reddish lesions were obtained from this population using punch biopsy (n = 30) or wedge biopsy (n = 4), then studied histopathologically. In addition, the incidence and macroscopic forms of reddish markings in each laparoscopic stage for the 478 subjects were examined to determine when reddish markings appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  Reddish markings on the liver surface appeared only after the appearance of hepatic parenchymal destruction subjacent to the liver capsule, rather than with the appearance of piecemeal necrosis in the portal area. Moreover, following expansion of necrotic hepatic parenchyma subjacent to the liver capsule and distortion of hepatic lobular architecture in this lesion, net-like or hemorrhagic fleck-like reddish markings appeared. Therefore, this was recognized as changes at the liver capsule, such as capillary proliferation and dilatation, and blood flow changes in both the capsule and hepatic parenchymal lesions subjacent to the liver capsule. With regards to timing, reddish markings were most frequently observed in the transition to liver cirrhosis. After the appearance of reddish markings on the liver surface, chronic hepatitis rapidly progressed to liver cirrhosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:  Reddish markings correspond to hepatic parenchymal destruction subjacent to the liver capsule, and not to piecemeal necrosis. Reddish markings appear in the transition to liver cirrhosis and might offer a useful marker of the progression to liver cirrhosis.",

    "abstract": "Background and study aims: Contact endoscopy is a technique allowing detailed magnified imaging of living epithelium, used extensively to assess tissues of gynecological and laryngeal origan. We used this technique during cholecystectomy to investigate its potential value for staging laparoscopy in gallbladder cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: Eight patients with gallbladder cancer, four with mucosal hyperplasia, two with benign polyps and nine with gallstones were evaluated. During surgery, the lens of the contact endoscope (8715AA, 5.5 mm in diameter with a 0° angle) was placed in contact with the serosa of the gallbladder and observations were performed at magnifications of 60 × and 150 ×.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults: Enlarged color images of the subserosal layer of the gallbladder were obtained. In normal mucosa, a fine vascular network with flowing erythrocytes was observed in the subserosal layer. Subserosal fat appeared as tortoiseshell-like markings, shown histologically to be clumps of fat cells surrounded by fine fibrous tissue. A gap between the deep vessels and the superficial vessels in the subserosal fat was also observed. The same findings were detected in gallbladder cancer patients where invasion was limited to the muscular layer. However, in patients with advanced gallbladder cancer, with invasion beyond the muscular layer, both the vessel gap and the fat tissue markings were absent. There was also encasement of the vessels and decreased intravascular flow of erythrocytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions: The contact endoscope can be useful in differentiating between early and advanced gallbladder cancer and has some potential for use in staging laparoscopy for gallbladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background and study aims\r\nAutoimmune bullous disease (ABD) is induced by autoantibodies against cell adhesion molecules, and blistering may occur on the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, mouse, oral cavity, laryngopharynx, and esophagus. The endoscopic prevalence and features of ABD-associated esophageal lesions are not well known. We conducted this investigation to assess the endoscopic prevalence of ABD-associated mucosal lesions. The endoscopic prevalence of mucosal lesions, particularly laryngopharyngeal and esophageal lesions was used as the primary endpoint to assess the significance of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UEG), and the clinical and endoscopic features were secondary endpoints.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOf 123 ABD patients, 50.4% had apparent oral or laryngopharyngeal lesions and 30.8% had laryngopharyngeal lesions. Esophageal lesions were detected through normal observation in 16.8% of affected patients, whereas 40.6% exhibited epidermolysis or blood blisters via mechanical inducement, regardless of esophageal mucosal lesion detection via normal observation. Additionally, 56.0% exhibited the Nikolsky sign with mechanical inducement.\r\n\r\nOf the 123 patients, 29.2% did not have exposed skin lesions. Of these patients, 77.7% had oral cavity or laryngopharyngeal lesions, 36.1% had esophageal lesions, and 58.3% exhibited the Nikolsky sign on esophageal mucosa.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIt is important to determine the endoscopic characteristics and findings of ABD. ABD could be suspected from endoscopic findings.\r\n\r\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Background:  We used percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy for detailed assessment of biliary tumors. Among the most important endoscopic findings is greater mucosal vascularity in malignant than in benign biliary strictures. Development of digital image processing now permits measurement of mucosal hemoglobin volume as a hemoglobin index. We studied the clinical usefulness of this hemoglobin index for differentiating malignant from benign biliary strictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:  From 2000 to 2002 we determined the hemoglobin index in 22 patients with biliary stricture (8 with bile duct carcinoma; 1 with carcinoma of the duodenum; 5 with pancreatic carcinoma and 8 with benign stricture). Eight patients with malignant stricture were diagnosed by the histological examinations of resected specimens; six with malignant stricture and eight with benign stricture were diagnosed by examination of biopsy specimens. The ratio of hemoglobin indices in a given patient of lesional and uninvolved mucosa was determined from cholangioscopic imaging data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults:  The mean hemoglobin index ratio for bile duct carcinoma was 1.83; for carcinoma of the duodenum 1.98; and for pancreatic carcinoma, 1.35. For benign strictures, the ratio was only 1.09. The mean hemoglobin index ratio in patients with bile duct or pancreatic carcinoma was significantly higher than in patients with benign stricture (P < 0.05, paired t-test).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions:  An image-derived hemoglobin index is useful for diagnostic assessment of biliary stricture.",

The risk of relapse is one of the main concerns in the consideration of reduction or cessation of treatment. In 2017 all paediatric IBD patients treated with originator infliximab at the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Ghent University Hospital, were switched to biosimilar Remsima®. Faecal calprotectin, infliximab through levels and antibodies, white cell count, haemoglobin and C-reactive protein were measured before and after switching to biosimilar. In total 21 IBD patients (3 Ulcerative Colitis - 19 CD) between 7 and 15 years old were switched. Three (14%) patients with CD in clinical, biochemical and histological remission had an unmeasurable through level and antibodies for infliximab, after 22 to 82 months of use. Switching to another treatment or cessation was discussed with patients and parents, all 3 patients decided to stop treatment. All 3 are still in clinical remission 21 to 24 months after treatment stop. Six-monthly follow-up is foreseen.",

    "abstract": "Background and aim Few studies have reported on a national, population-based endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) database. Hence, in 2015, we established a multicenter ERCP database registry, the Japan Endoscopic Database (JED) Project in preparation for a nationwide endoscopic database. The objective the present study was to evaluate this registry before the establishment of a nationwide endoscopic database. Methods From 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2017, we collected and analyzed the ERCP data of all patients who underwent ERCP in four participating centers in the JED Project based on the JED protocol. Results Four centers carried out 4104 ERCP on 2173 patients. Data entry of ERCP information (age, 100%; gender, 100%; American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System, 74.5%; scope, 92.7%; time to ERCP, 100%; antithrombotic drug information, 55.0%; primary selective common bile duct [CBD] cannulation methods, 73.0%; number of attempts at primary selective CBD cannulation, 67.6%; overall selective CBD cannulation methods, 68.9%; ERCP procedure time, 66.3%; fluoroscopy time, 65.1%; adverse events, 74.9%; serum amylase levels 1 day post-ERCP, 36.5%) was accurately extracted from the four centers. Success rate of CBD cannulation by level of ERCP difficulty was 98.5%, 99.0%, and 96.4% in grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Complication rate by overall selective CBD cannulation method was 5.6%, 7.6%, and 10.5% in the contrast-assisted technique, guidewire-assisted technique, and cross-over method, respectively. Conclusion Data from this evaluation of the JED Project, a multicenter ERCP database registry, suggest the feasibility of establishing a nationwide ERCP database and its challenges.",

    "abstract": "Though portal systemic shunt has become a routine procedure, the correct surgical management of portal hypertension in cirrhosis still presents a number of problems both as to the indications and the results. It is true that in general the established operations for portal systemic shunt produce regression of the esophageal varices and protect the patient from recurrent bleeding, but they provide only palliative therapy and in no way eliminate the actual cause of portal hypertension, i.e. the lesion of the liver parenchyma. On the contrary, the diminution of blood supply to the liver which these operations inevitably bring about through the complete or partial shunting of splanchnic vein blood impairs the regenerative capacity of the liver and thus accelerates the development of severe hepatic failure, terminating in postshunt encephalopathy, coma and death. This is the reason why new procedures and refinements of older techniques have been proposed in recent years with the object of reducing the adverse effects of the classic portal systemic shunt. The authors list the principal types of shunt currently performed. They set forth the advantages and drawbacks of the techniques and, in the light of recent advances, attempt to clarify the present trends of this type of surgery and to justify them.",

A belated symptomatology, especially in cases of gallbladder cancer, explains why the intervention is so often delayed and why the prognosis of these lesions is so poor. The efforts of the past few yr tending to perform radical surgical removal of the tumor appear relatively inefficient. Taking into account the failure of aggressive surgical operations, a special attempt should be made to improve the life expectancy of the patients by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with palliative surgery. In addition, the systematic cholecystectomy in cases of cholelithiasis should provide better results.",

Clinical, radiologic and the correct endoscopic data are very similar to those of cancer, but diagnosis is based on the histologic thickening of the gastric wall and its inflammatory granulomatous infiltration. Isolated granulomatous gastritis is differentiated from the gastric localization of Crohn's disease or from sarcoidosis by the brevity of the clinical evolution, by the absence of localization on the small gut, by the lack of hypercalcemia and hypergammaglobulinemia, by the absence of granulomatous invasion of the epiploic lymph nodes, by the lack of anergy to tuberculin, candidine and varidase, by a normal lymphoblastic transformation test with phytohemagglutinine, and by a normal macrophage migration inhibitory factor.",

Nearly all these trials have been conducted in compensated cirrhosis and, unfortunately, their end-points were not identical. Conflicting data have been obtained with regard to a potential advantage for interferon therapy in term of normalization in Liver function tests, disappearance of serum HCV RNA and/or the risk of hepatocarcinoma development. Zn deconpensated cirrhosis, the use of antiviral therapy is not recommended. In conclusion, antiviral therapy in cirrhotic HCV patients should only be conducted on the basis of prospective, randomized clinical trials in which efficacy in term of virologic effect, incidence of complications and survival must be carefully investigated taking also into account the incidence of side effects and the cost of antiviral drugs.",

    "abstract": "A benign and perforated ulcer of the rectum, appearing a few weeks after a toxic pyrazol-induced agranulocytosis, is an original disease. The confrontation of clinical and histological data yields the conclusion that we are dealing with an acute attack of ulcerous rectocolitis, limited to the rectum. The hypothesis of an identical etiology for agranulocytosis and rectocolitis is discussed. The relationship with the intake of the pyrazol-component is suggested. The therapeutic attitude is defined and explained on the basis of the observed complications and, on the other hand, taking in account the danger of a later relapse or a malignant degeneration.",

    "abstract": "The authors review the recent literature about the classification of primary motor disorders of the oesophagus: achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus, hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter and non-specific intermediary disorders. In fact these motility disorders belong to a spectrum of diseases closely related, with chronological transformation of a specific disorder to another one or to intermediary disorders. Most of the recent pathophysiological research concerned primary achalasia, secondary achalasia syndromes being a kind of experimental model. These studies point to a morphological or functional deficiency of postganglionic nerves inhibiting the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) through noncholinergic nonadrenergic neurotransmitters. Recent advances in the treatment of achalasia and other motility disorders are not yet based on these findings. Although calcium channel blockers, like nifedipine, lower LOS basal pressure, they are not very useful on long term relief of symptoms of achalasia. Pneumatic dilatations or cardiomyotomy still remain the best methods of treatment of this disease.",

The influence of dietary fibre deficiency explaining the increasing prevalence in industrialized countries and the variable geographical distribution are explained, as well as the effects of dietary fibres on colonic functions. Progressive elastosis of the taeniae may explain the influence of age on the incidence of diverticulosis. The rationale for the introduction of dietary fibre into the treatment is based on the observation that a high fibre diet such as coarse bran is lowering the colonic pressure and therefore may prevent the development of new diverticula and complications, although an effect on symptoms is not always obtained.",

    "abstract": "Over recent years, the study of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver has considerably progressed. The application of new biochemical and genetic techniques led to the discovery of 13 different collagen proteins and a growing number of collagen-associated proteins such as fibronectin, laminin and proteoglycans. Many of these proteins have been cloned and sequenced. Progress also includes a better knowledge of the biological roles of ECM components as well as its dynamic remodeling in various pathophysiological conditions. Even if the clinical goal of prophylaxis and therapy of fibrosis remains distant, progress can be anticipated in the near future as basic processes are being elucidated.",

    "abstract": "The authors review the indications and outcome of liver transplantation for hepatic cirrhosis of various aetiologies in adults, on the basis of their experience and that of the literature. Up to 1989, they performed 107 liver transplantations in 93 adults, including 70 patients with cirrhosis: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in 20, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in 2, secondary biliary cirrhosis in 1, post-necrotic cirrhosis in 35, alcoholic cirrhosis in 5, metabolic cirrhosis in 7. The best indications are PBC with rising bilirubinemia (greater than 5 mg/dl) or portal hypertension and PSC with severe and diffuse lesions. The outcome of transplantation was satisfactory in patients with PBC: 16 survived with a mean follow-up of 23 months. In patients transplanted for postnecrotic cirrhosis the outcome might be better if HBS is associated preoperatively with delta antigen: 6 patients of this group survived with a mean follow-up of 12.6 months while in the group of 8 patients with HBS not associated preoperatively with delta antigen, 6 patients survived with a mean follow-up of 12.8 months. There was a trend toward a higher hospital mortality after transplantation in cirrhotic patients with pulmonary arterio-venous shunts in comparison with cirrhotic patients without significant pulmonary arterio-venous shunts preoperatively.",

    "abstract": "The authors review the recent literature about the classification of primary motor disorders of the oesophagus: achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus, hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter and non-specific intermediary disorders. In fact these motility disorders belong to a spectrum of diseases closely related, with chronological transformation of a specific disorder to another one or to intermediary disorders. Most of the recent pathophysiological research concerned primary achalasia, secondary achalasia syndromes being a kind of experimental model. These studies point to a morphological or functional deficiency of postganglionic nerves inhibiting the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) through noncholinergic nonadrenergic neurotransmitters. Recent advances in the treatment of achalasia and other motility disorders are not yet based on these findings. Although calcium channel blockers, like nifedipine, lower LOS basal pressure, they are not very useful on long term relief of symptoms of achalasia. Pneumatic dilatations or cardiomyotomy still remain the best methods of treatment of this disease.",

Retrograde cholangiography showed injuries of the intrahepatic ducts in 93 p. cent; the more frequently observed lesions were short and multifocal strictures, associated with irregularities of the biliary wall or decreased arborization of intrahepatic bile ducts, but without marked dilatation. Mean follow-up was 44 months (3 to 120). Actuarial survival was 48 p. cent at 5 years. In 4 patients, because of poor clinical and biological (serum bilirubin greater than or equal to 4 mg/dl) evolution, a second retrograde cholangiography was performed showing in all cases apparition of marked ductal dilatation in extra-hepatic (one case) or in intra-hepatic bile ducts (three cases). We diagnosed one benign extra-hepatic stricture, two cholangiocarcinoma and one biliary cirrhosis complicating PSC. We concluded that retrograde cholangiography is necessary if jaundice appears to diagnose every complications of PSC. Apparition of marked ductal dilatation should be the witness of pejorative evolution, especially apparition of cholangiocarcinoma that must be excluded.",

Digestive or metabolic inputs are conveyed to the hypothalamus by endocrine and neuroendocrine pathways (insulin, cholecystokinin). The hypothalamus regulates feeding behavior both quantitatively and qualitatively through several neuroendocrine mediators (neuropeptide Y, galanin, GHRH...). The hypothalamus also integrates, by its communicative network, inputs from the cortex, the sub-cortex, the peripheral metabolism and it modifies consequently the feeding behavior. These neuroendocrine models are developped from many experimental observations both in normal and obese animals.",

The mechanism may be immunoallergic. The clinical presentation of the chronic form resembles that of primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis. Its prognosis is generally good and characterized by a complete recovery. However, an evolution to biliary cirrhosis is sometimes possible. The mechanism could also be immunoallergic. Extrahepatic cholestasis is frequently observed after intra-arterial infusion of floxuridine. The prognosis is generally poor. The mechanism of this sclerosing cholangitis may be ischaemic.",
